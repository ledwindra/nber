1. Introduction

Many macroeconomists believe that price stickiness is necessary for generating persistent
real economic responses to shifts in monetary policy. Many recent macroeconomic models
have incorporated this feature through staggering in the style of Taylor [1980] to study the
consequences of monetary shocks and alternative monetary policy rules. Increasingly these
macroeconomic models are being built under the discipline imposed by solid microeconomic
foundations, with the hope that they will better match actual economic behavior and be
more suitable for use in normative analysis1 .
       However, as these macroeconomic models have developed better microfoundations, a
chronic Þnding has been that there is little persistence in the response of real economic ac-
tivity to nominal shocks. Recently, this “persistence problem” has been highlighted by Chari,
Kehoe, and McGrattan [2000]. These authors display the persistence problem in a standard
calibration of a general equilibrium model with sticky prices and imperfect competition;
they also show that the problem continues to arise under many diﬀerent parameter settings
and with many diﬀerent model modiÞcations that have been suggested in the literature.
While they do not disagree that monetary policy shocks may have persistent eﬀects empir-
ically, CKM [2000] instead claim that microfoundations provide restrictions that eliminate
the persistence of ßuctuations found in early nominal rigidity models developed by Taylor
and others. In particular, they indicate that “in versions of our model without intertemporal
links, staggered price-setting leads to persistent output ßuctuations after monetary shocks,
but once such links are introduced, output ßuctuations are no longer persistent.” In essence,
the message is that the eﬀect of imposing quantitative general equilibrium discipline on New
Keynesian economics is to destroy its empirical promise.
       By contrast, we suggest that constructing a more realistic general equilibrium macro-
economic model will lead to substantial persistence and otherwise enhance the empirical
promise of this class of models. Our counter-argument is based on three key aspects of the
production structure that are central to real business cycle analysis. These features are rel-
evant across many industries in most modern economies and involve: (1) a substantial role
for produced inputs, (2) signiÞcant variability in capacity utilization, and (3) variation in
labor supply along an extensive margin. Each of these supply-side features allows for a more
elastic response of output to demand without increased marginal cost, so we term these “real
ßexibilities”2 .
   1
     Goodfriend and King [1997] describe such models, which blend the New Keynesian mechanisms of
imperfect competition and sticky prices with the classical real business cycle model, as the New Neoclassical
Synthesis.
   2
     By contrast Ball and Romer [1993] study various market imperfections that impede the response of


                                                     2
    Working in a simple loglinear business cycle framework related to that of Taylor [1980],
we show that these supply-side elements substantially reduce the sensitivity of marginal cost
to variations in aggregate output. That is: smaller variations in marginal cost lead Þrms
to make smaller price adjustments or to adjust less frequently or both, which diminishes
the sensitivity of the price level to changes in aggregate demand. In turn, the increased
sluggishness of the price level leads to increased persistence of output. In addition, when
we include these features in a fully articulated quantitative general equilibrium model they
continue to lead to substantial sluggishness in the price level and substantial persistence in
output ßuctuations.
    In addition to producing persistent real eﬀects of monetary shocks, our model economies
also have other implications that make them more consistent with conventional wisdom about
cyclical ßuctuations. First, economists have long noted that, over the course of business
cycles, the level of real economic activity varies sharply with apparently small accompanying
changes in the real rewards to capital and labor. Second, dating back to at least Burns and
Mitchell [1946], students of business cycles have noted that the movements in output and
labor input are approximately proportionate at both the industry and aggregate level. Third,
in many industries materials input is a large fraction of gross output, which varies cyclically in
a manner that is also roughly proportionate to gross output and value-added. Fourth, when
measures of varying capacity utilization are constructed, these measures display substantial
cyclical variability, at least as great as that of labor. Fifth, in most industries, the bulk of
business cycle variations in total man-hours are accounted for by changes in employment
rather than in hours-per-worker.
    Without real ßexibilities, our model would have great diﬃculty accounting for the above
mentioned stylized facts. For example, without variable capacity utilization and holding
productivity Þxed, the standard aggregate model implies that output will change roughly
two-thirds as much as labor input. Without real ßexibilities, our model would also suggest
implausibly large variations in factor prices, notably in wages, relative to the output response.
In studying the eﬀects of real ßexibilities our work is related Kimball [1995], who studies
mechanisms for reducing the responsiveness of marginal cost to output, and Bergin and
Feenstra [2000], who explore the role of intermediate inputs. Like these earlier authors, we
Þnd that increased supply elasticities and materials inputs separately contribute to increased
persistence, but we also Þnd that their eﬀects on persistence are mutually reinforcing.
   Although our models generate substantial persistence, they also generate some puzzling
predictions. Substantial expected inßation arises because the monetary shocks studied are
ones that raise the long-run path of the price-level and because the price level only adjusts
factor prices and marginal cost to changes in output, which they label “real rigidities.”


                                                      3
gradually. As a result, nominal interest rates rise in response to positive monetary injections:
this is another recurrent result for this class of models. Some have argued that this interest
rate response, by itself, is a fatal deÞciency of the class of models since monetary expansions
are widely taken to lower rather than raise the nominal interest rate. However, we suspect
this implication can be overturned by incorporating a more realistic speciÞcation of monetary
policy without overturning the central result that monetary policy shocks lead to persistent
changes in economic activity.
   The organization of the paper is as follows. Section 2 discusses the implications that the
production structure has for the cyclical behavior of real marginal cost. It contrasts the im-
plication of two views: the standard perspective that the elasticity of real marginal cost with
respect to output is quite high, as imbedded in CKM [2000], with the implications of our
production structure, which makes it quite small. Section 3 uses a simple loglinear macroeco-
nomic model to highlight how these alternative views of the elasticity of real marginal cost
with respect to output translate into predictions about the persistence of output. Section 4
provides an overview of our fully articulated macroeconomic model, which is then used to
evaluate the general equilibrium dynamics in response to monetary disturbances. Section 5
shows how the persistence of output depends on structural features of this economy. Section
6 is a conclusion.


2. Marginal cost and the supply side

The cyclical behavior of real marginal cost plays a central role in modern business cycle
models with imperfect competition and sticky prices. In turn, the supply side of the model
economy governs how the cyclical behavior of real marginal cost is related to the level of
output and this relationship is critical for the cyclical comovement of factors of production
and relative prices. In this section, we highlight two alternative visions of the supply-side
determinants of real marginal cost and factor variability: a standard one that is present in
many models in the literature and an alternative one that stresses materials inputs, variable
capacity utilization, and variable labor supply on the extensive margin. In the subsequent
sections of the paper we then build this supply side into a small loglinear model and a fully
articulated macroeconomic model.




                                               4
2.1. The standard view of marginal cost and output

The standard view of the link between marginal cost and output does not involve intermediate
inputs or variable capacity utilization3 . With a constant returns to scale production function
and economy-wide competitive factor markets,

                             log(yt /y) = α log(nt /n) + (1 − α) log(kt /k)
where α is labor’s cost share in output, yt is output, nt is labor input and kt is the stock of
capital as well as the relevant measure of capital input (a variable without a time subscript
indicates a steady state value). Further, with any constant returns to scale technology real
marginal cost is related to input prices according to

                             log(ψ t /ψ) = α log(wt /w) + (1 − α) log(qt /q)

where wt is the real wage rate and qt is the rental price of capital.
  The preceding two equations have important implications for some of the stylized facts
about ßuctuations that were mentioned in the introduction. First, since capital input is
largely Þxed, models developed along these lines have diﬃculty matching the observed cycli-
cal behavior of output and labor input, which is roughly proportionate. In the model, labor
must be more volatile. For example, with α = 2/3, a 1 percent increase in output requires a
1.5 percent increase in labor input. Second, real marginal cost is fundamentally governed by
movements in factor prices: if these are sensitive to cyclical variations in output, marginal
cost will also be highly sensitive.
   To study the implications for factor prices it is convenient to use a Cobb-Douglas produc-
tion function implying that log(qt /q) − log(wt /w) = log(nt /n) − log(kt /k). With aggregate
capital Þxed in any given period and for convenience normalized to its steady state value,
                                                                                                     1
its rental price is thus related to output according to log(qt /q) = log(wt /w) +                    α
                                                                                                         log(yt ).
Assuming that there is a labor supply schedule of the form

                               log(nt /n) = ζ w log(wt /w) − ζ y log(yt /y),
                                                                   1+αζ y
labor market equilibrium will require that log(wt /w) =             αζ w
                                                                            log(yt /y)4 , so that the behavior
of real marginal cost is
                                     (1 − α)     1/α + ζ y
                  log(ψ t /ψ) = {[           ]+[           ]} log(yt /y) = φ log(yt /y).
                                        α           ζw
   3
      The standard analysis of the cyclical behavior of real marginal cost is based on a Cobb Douglas production
function and is described by Bils [1987]. It has been built into general equilibrium sticky price models of the
Calvo sort by King and Wolman [1996] and Yun [1996] and forms the reference case for Chari et al [2000].
    4
      While we work with a labor supply schedule here, we note that Dotsey et al. [1999] assume that there
is no aggregate variation in capital and that there is a representative consumer with a utility function
  1    1−σ    χ
1−σ c      − 1+γ (1 − l)1+γ . This preference speciÞcation gives rise to the labor supply schedule in the text,

                                                       5
    This expression highlights two aspects of the cyclical behavior of marginal cost. More
speciÞcally, it shows two inßuences on the elasticity of real marginal cost with respect to
output, which we call φ here and below. The Þrst bracketed term reßects the increase in
the rental rate on capital. Additional labor is required to produce additional output and
this additional labor increases the marginal product of capital, thus raising its rental price
proportionately in the Cobb-Douglas case. Given that the cost share of capital is (1 −α), the
overall eﬀect is [ (1−α)
                     α
                         ]=    1
                               2
                                   if labor’s share is α = 2/3. The second bracketed term involves
the change in wages, which in turn depend on the labor supply elasticity ζ w and the eﬀect
of output on labor supply ζ y , as well as the slope of the eﬀective demand for labor.5 For
example, if ζ y = ζ w = 1 then the second bracketed expression is 5/2 implying a value of
φ = 3 under the traditional view. Thus, marginal cost responds highly elastically to output.
Also, as the labor supply elasticity becomes inÞnite φ takes on its minimum value of [ (1−α)
                                                                                         α
                                                                                             ].6

2.2. An alternative view based on real ßexibilities

A quite diﬀerent view of the links between marginal cost, inputs, and output is suggested by
the models that we construct in this paper, which feature: (i) materials inputs, (ii) elastic
factor supply, and (iii) small reasons for Þrms to substitute between inputs, either due to
technology or relative factor price movements. SpeciÞcally, we make two sets of assumption
about factor supply that diﬀer from the standard view. First, we assume that capital services
are inßuenced by both the capital stock and the utilization rate (zt ), with the quantity of
capital services given by kts = zt kt . As explained in more detail later in the paper, we assume
that a higher rate of utilization involves higher marginal depreciation costs, implying that
utilization is an increasing function of the rental rate. To a Þrst approximation, this supply
of capital services can be written as

                                          log(qt /q) = ξ log(zt /z)                                      (2.1)
under some assumptions that are worth highlighting. Initially, assume that consumption and output move
together with log(ct /c) = τ log(yt /y) . Then, it follows that the labor supply schedule would take the form
in the text with ζ w = 1/γ and ζ y = σ ∗ τ . In many of the numerical examples in the text we will assume
σ = τ = 1, as suggested by a model in which there is balanced growth and consumption and investment
are identical. Further, with τ 6= 1, the model can be used to mimic economies with consumption volatility
calibrated to be some fraction of output volatility.

     As in the general disequilibrium literature of the late 1970s, the labor demand that is relevant in the
current discussion is given by the requirement that a given level of output be produced. The prior discussion
indicates that labor demand may therefore be written as log(nt /n) = (1/α) log(yt /y). Thus the slope is 1/α,
which is the Þrst term in the numerator of the second bracketed expression.

     Continuing the discussion of footnote 4, Dotsey et. al. [1999] study a reference case in which ζ y = 1 and
values of ζ w between ∞ and .2. They Þnd small output and not very persistent output eﬀects.


                                                      6
where ξ is an inverse supply elasticity. Second, we assume there is variation in both hours
per worker (ht ) and the number of employed individuals (et ), with the total quantity of man-
hours being given by nt = ht et . Consistent with much empirical work on business cycles, we
assume that the employment rate responds substantially over the cycle, making the supply
of elasticity for total hours much larger than the supply elasticity of hours per worker. This
accords with the analysis of the eﬀect of wages on labor supply in Mulligan [1998].
   Intermediate inputs with limited factor substitution: A typical Þrm in our economy has a
production function for gross output of the nested constant returns-to-scale form ((2.2) and
(2.3)), where gross output ytg is a function of a materials input aggregate (to be discussed
further below) in the amount xt and another aggregate yt , which we will interpret as the
Þrm’s value-added. The value-added input is a function of labor input (in man-hours nt )
and capital services input (in amount kts ).
                                        ytg = g(xt , yt )                                 (2.2)
                                        yt = f (nt , kts )                                (2.3)
For illustrative purposes in this section, we will assume that both g and f are essentially
Þxed proportions implying that intermediate inputs, gross output and net output move one-
for-one together, and that net output, labor and capital utilization also move together in a
one-for-one manner.
   But, even though our production functions are assumed to have low elasticities of sub-
stitution, it is still the case that there are Þrst-order approximations to the levels of gross
and net output resembling those of the basic model.
                log(ytg /y g ) = sx log(xt /x) + (1 − sx ) log(yt /y)
                 log(yt /y) = α log(nt /n) + (1 − α)[log(zt /z) + log(kt /k)],
where sx is the share of intermediate inputs in gross output and α is labor’s share in net
output (value added). One key implication is that even with the capital stock held Þxed,
demand-induced changes in net output can now be accommodated through changes in factors
of production other than labor.
    Further, the loglinear equation governing the relationship between marginal cost and
factor prices is
                 log(ψ t /ψ) = sx log(pxt /px ) + sn log(wt /w) + sk log(qt /q)
                             = sn log(wt /w) + sk log(qt /q)
with the factor shares given by sn = (1 − sx )α; and sk = (1 − sx )(1 − α). The second
equality follows from our assumption that materials input is a perfect substitute for both
consumption and investment. Thus, materials input has a relative price of one.

                                                7
   The last expression highlights the quantitative importance of introducing materials input
for the relationship between real marginal cost and the prices of labor and capital input.
For example, assuming that materials inputs have a cost share s = 2/3 of gross output,
which is a representative value from the Annual Survey of Manufactures, and that labors
share in net output is also 2/3, then it follows that sn = (2/3) ∗ (2/3) = 2/9 = .22 and
sk = (2/3) ∗ (1/3) = 1/9 = .11. Thus, the introduction of materials input substantially
reduces the responsiveness of real marginal cost to changes in w and q.
   Marginal cost and factor supply: In the Þxed proportion case, net output, labor and
utilization all move proportionately (log(yt /y) = log(nt /n) = log(zt /z)). Hence, factor
prices must be determined on the factor supply side. Using (2.1), the response of the rental
rate to output is
                                     log(qt /q) = ξ log(yt /y).
In contrast to the standard view, the rental rate now depends on the supply elasticity for
capital services.
    Again assuming that the labor supply function is log(nt /n) = ζ w log(wt /w)−ζ y log(yt /y),
it follows that the wage rate’s response to output is
                                                1 + ζy
                                 log(wt /w) =          log(yt /y)
                                                  ζw
Notice that the real wage is less sensitive to output than in the previous solution, in which
                              1/α+ζ y
the comparable coeﬃcient is     ζw
                                      .
                                  There is a smaller eﬀect in the numerator because labor
demand does not need to bear the entire burden of producing increased output: utilization
is varied one-for-one with labor.
   Combining these expressions with the loglinear equation governing the relationship be-
tween marginal cost and factor prices, we Þnd that

            log(ψ t /ψ) = (1 − sx )(1 − α) log(qt /q) + (1 − sx )α log(wt /w)
                                                  1 + ζy
                        = (1 − sx )[(1 − α)ξ + α         ] log(yt /y) = φ log(yt /y).
                                                    ζw
A number of key results follow from this expression concerning the determinants of the
elasticity of real marginal cost with respect to output, which we again call φ. First, the
use of intermediate inputs (incorporated by the term sx ), as well as elastic factor supply
(small ξ and large ζ w ) reduce the sensitivity of marginal cost to output. In concert, these
features can have are particularly powerful eﬀect. Second, it is a general equilibrium labor
supply elasticity that is relevant for the elasticity of marginal cost φ, i.e., one which takes
into account shifts (ζ y ) as well as its slope (ζ w ). These features will also carry over to the
model that we develop in section 4 below.

                                                 8
       A benchmark calculation under the alternative view : We can also use this expression to
undertake a benchmark calculation similar to that done for the standard view above, where
we learned that a lower bound was φ = 3. As an example, suppose that the share of materials
in gross costs is two-thirds (sx = 2/3) and that the share of labor in value added is two-thirds
(α = 2/3). Mulligan [1998] suggests that labor supply elasticities with both intensive and
extensive margins can easily be as large as 2 and Basu and Kimball [1997]’s empirical work
suggests a utilization elasticity of ξ = 1, although larger values are also not unreasonable.
Then, if there are no general equilibrium eﬀects on labor supply, the computed lower bound
for φ = (1/3) ∗ [(1/3) ∗ 1 + (2/3) ∗ (1/2)] = (2/9) = .1667. The elasticity of marginal cost is
higher if there are general equilibrium eﬀects on labor supply. For example, using a standard
value of ζ y = 1, then φ = (1/3) ∗ [(1/3) ∗ 1 + (2/3) ∗ (2/2)] = 1/3 = .333.7 Thus, the class
of models developed here can easily yield an elasticity of real marginal cost with respect to
output that is much less than unity.


3. A simple instructive macro model

We highlight the macroeconomic issues using a simple log-linear rational expectations model
along the lines of Sargent [1978] and Taylor [1980]. In doing so we are able to highlight the
relationship between various key elasticities, the production structure, and persistence.

3.1. Price adjustment and marginal cost

The model combines the supply side features just derived with the monopolistically compet-
itive setting of Blanchard and Kiyotaki [1987] together with sticky prices modeled along the
lines of Calvo [1983]. These features imply two equations governing the behavior of prices.
One is a backward looking price level equation that is a weighted average of the nominal
                               ∗
prices set in prior periods (Pt−j ). It takes a particularly simple form under Calvo’s assump-
tion that price adjustment opportunities arrive to Þrms with probability (1 − η) each period.
The price level equation is
                                      ∞
                                      X
                   log Pt = (1 − η)         ηj log Pt−j
                                                     ∗
                                                        = η log Pt−1 + (1 − η) log Pt∗ ,               (3.1)
                                      j=0

which can be rewritten as a partial adjustment mechanism, Pt −Pt−1 = (1−η)[Pt∗ −Pt−1 ]. The
partial adjustment interpretation indicates that the price level responds only gradually when
   7
    The sense in which ζ y = 1 is a standard value is based on the discussion of footnote 4: it is consistent
with balanced growth (σ = 1) and consumption equal to output (τ = 1), which is a condition frequently
imposed in small macro models of the form developed in the current section.


                                                      9
Pt∗ is raised above Pt−1 with the extent of price level adjustment equal to the microeconomic
probability of price adjustment. The other equation is forward looking reßecting the fact that
Þrms understand that their prices may be sticky in future periods. They appropriately set
their price to maximize a discounted expected stream of proÞts. Thus, current price-setting
depends on future nominal marginal cost,
                                               X
                                               ∞
                        log Pt∗ = (1 − βη)       (βη)j Et [log(ψ t+j /ψ) + log Pt ]                     (3.2)
                                               j=0
                                                 ∗
                                =     ηβEt log Pt+1   + (1 − βη)[log(ψ t /ψ) + log Pt ],                (3.3)

where ψ t is real marginal cost and ψ is the steady state value of real marginal cost.

3.2. The persistence problem

If we combine the analysis of the preceding two sections with a simple money demand
equation (log Mt −log Pt = γ log yt ) and a money supply rule of the form (log Mt −log Mt−1 =
ρ(log Mt−1 − log Mt−2 ) + et ), then it is possible to work out the dynamic solutions for output
and the price level explicitly:
                                                       ∞
                                                       X
               log Pt   = θ log Pt−1 + (1 − θ)(1 − βθ)   (βθ)j Et (log Mt+j )                           (3.4)
                                                             j=0
                                                                  1−θ
                        = θ log Pt−1 + (1 − θ) log Mt−1 +                (log Mt − log Mt−1 )
                                                                 1 − θβρ
where θ is the smaller root—which can be shown to be between zero and one—of the equation
βz 2 − [1 + β + ϕ]z + 1 = 0 with ϕ = (1−η)(1−βη)φ
                                          ηγ
                                                  .8 Further, since γyt = Mt − Pt , the model’s
implications for output are readily calculated
                                      θ 1 − βρ
                     log(yt /y) = (             )[log Mt − log Mt−1 ] + θ[log(yt−1 /y)]                 (3.5)
                                      γ 1 − θβρ
   This solution can be used to highlight the persistence problem. The parameter η is
a structural measure of price-stickiness persistence, built into the model. If the expected
duration of a price is two quarters for example, then η = 1/2. By contrast, θ is a system
measure of the model’s implication for output and price persistence, which is inßuenced by
the elasticity of real marginal cost with respect to output, φ, the income elasticity of the
demand for money, γ and so forth. When β is close to one, then it follows that θ ≷ η as φγ ≶ 1.
That is, with a money demand elasticity of one and values of φ > 1 under the standard view,
  8
      See the appendices to King [2001] for a derivation of this solution and the implication that 0 < θ < 1.




                                                       10
one does not obtain greater system persistence (θ) than structural persistence.9 This is the
CKM [2000] result.
       For concreteness we work through the following example. Let the income elasticity of
money demand, γ be 1 and take the standard view of marginal cost, which implies a value of
φ = 3. With this parameterization, there will be less system persistence (θ) than structural
persistence (η) because the elasticity φ exceeds one. This result is shown graphically in Figure
3.1 The simulation also highlights other features of the sticky price model when combined
with the conventional production structure.
       Exogenous shocks and assumed rigidities: In panel D, the monetary shock is shown as
the dashed line: there is a one percent increase in money at the impact date (t=1) and
the positive serial correlation in money growth leads to a gradual increase to a level of
the money stock which is two percent higher in the long run. In panel A, the extent of
exogenous persistence parameterized by η = .5 is illustrated by the ‘*’ path: it is .5 at date
t=1; .52 = .25 at date t=2 and so forth.
   Response of the price level and output: The response of output as shown in panel A
is small relative to the assumed price rigidity: there is an impact eﬀect on output of less
than .2% even though half of the Þrms have sticky prices. The output eﬀect is also not
very persistent, although the Calvo form of pricing means that it dies away gradually rather
than simply stopping immediately as in the Þnite lag overlapping contracts model used in
the simulations of CKM [2000]. Given the quantity equation, this small output response is
inversely related to a rapid price level response, which is shown in panel D. Even though
only half the Þrms can adjust their prices at date 1, the price level rises by .8% on impact
because adjusting Þrms face a high marginal cost and foresee future inßation, so that they
adjust their prices by 1.5% in response to a one percent monetary shock.
   Response of labor, relative prices and real marginal cost: Panel B shows that labor re-
sponds more elastically than output. With α = 2/3 the response is 1.5 times as large as
output. Panel C shows that real marginal cost rises substantially, which is directly related
to the parameterization of φ = 3.10
   9
    One also sees that a lower income elasticity of money demand makes it more diﬃcult for the model
to generate persistence. This result is a general equilibrium feature of the model. For any given change
in money and the corresponding change in output, a lower income elasticity requires a larger price level
response to equilibrate the money market. The larger impact eﬀect on the price level and hence on adjusting
Þrms prices tends to speed up the price adjustment response to the shock. We will see below that a similar
argument is true for the interest elasticity of money demand in that a larger interest elasticity reduces the
endogenous persistence of the model.

  10
       The separate components of real marginal cost are also illustrated: since capital is in Þxed supply, while



                                                        11
3.3. Persistence with the alternative view of marginal cost, inputs, and output

In our discussion of the alternative view of marginal cost in section 2, we considered the
elasticity of marginal cost to output under the following assumptions about parameters: a
materials input share of two-thirds (sx = 2/3); labor’s share of net output of two-thirds
(α = 2/3); a unit elastic supply of capacity (ξ = 1); and some additional assumptions about
labor (a labor supply wage elasticity of ζ w = 2 and a general equilibrium labor supply shift
of ζ y = 1). Taking all of these parameters together, we found that φ = .333.
    Using this elasticity of marginal cost with respect to output we now Þnd that there are
quantitatively large persistence eﬀects. With β essentially one, it follows that

                                 (1 − η)(1 − βη)φ   (1/2)(1/2) .33
                           ϕ=                     =                = .16
                                        ηγ            (1/2)     1

implying that θ in equation (3.4) is .66 and that there is now more system persistence than
exogenous structural persistence.
    Figure 3.2 shows the simulated response of the simple macroeconomic model to a mon-
etary shock under the alternative view of real marginal cost’s relationship to output. Some
aspects of this diagram can be easily calculated from the solution for output given above,
                   1−βρ
(log(yt /y) = ( γθ 1−θβρ )[log Mt − log Mt−1 ] + θ[log(yt−1 /y)]). Using ρ = .5, this solution in-
dicates that there is an impact output multiplier with respect to a money shock, et , equal
         1−βρ                                         1−βρ
to ( γθ 1−θβρ ) = .5 and a total multiplier11 of ( γθ 1−θβρ    1
                                                            ) 1−ρ  1
                                                                  1−θ
                                                                      = 3. By contrast in Figure 3.1,
these eﬀects are .19 and .54 respectively. As a measure of the persistence of real output,
we have found it convenient to compute the mean lag. Letting κj be the impulse response
                                                            P
coeﬃcient for output at lag j, the mean lag is the ratio of ∞   j=0 j ∗ κj to the total multiplier
P∞        12
  j=0 κj .   For the basic model of Figure 3.1, this mean lag is 1.45 quarters. By contrast the
model in Figure 3.2, produces a mean lag of 2.83 quarters. The near doubling of this mean
lag captures the shift in the impulse response distribution from one that is concentrated in
the Þrst few quarters to one that is much more persistent.
labor is not, the rental rate rises by more than the real wage rate.
  11
     The total multiplier can be calculated easily because
                                       θ 1 − βρ
                       log(yt /y) = (             )[log Mt − log Mt−1 ] + θ[log(yt /y)])
                                       γ 1 − θβρ
                                          1     θ 1 − βρ      1
                                   = [        (           )       ]et .
                                       1 − θL γ 1 − θβρ 1 − ρL
To do so, we “evaluate” the bracketed expression at L = 1 as in the main text. This is a basic application
of z-transform methods, as discussed for example in Sargent [1978].
  12
     In practice, we truncate the sums in these expressions at 12 quarters, but it makes little diﬀerence to
the computed mean lag if we add more terms.



                                                      12
   The movements in real marginal cost, the wage rate, and the rental rate on capital
services are shown Panel C of Figure 3.2. Because utilization adjusts one-for-one with the
rental price, the path for the real rental rate mimics the path of output exactly. For the
parameter values described above, the general equilibrium elasticity of the wage with respect
               1+ζ y       2
to output is    ζw
                       =   2
                               = 1 so that the real wage is also exactly as variable as output. But, real
marginal cost moves by only one-third as much because there is a materials share sx = 2/3.
   The modest movements in real marginal cost means that adjusting Þrms are less aggres-
sive in panel D of Figure 3.2 relative to panel D of Figure 3.1. Notably, the Þrms in Figure
3.2 choose to set a price P ∗ that rises by roughly the same percent as the money stock on
impact. Since the price level is partly predetermined, this means that it responds sluggishly.
Further, later in the impulse response, both P ∗ and P trail increases in the money stock.
This behavior contrasts to the dramatic “over adjustment” by price-setting Þrms in Figure
3.1.

3.4. Summary of results from loglinear macro model

We interpret the results from the loglinear macroeconomic model as bearing three key mes-
sages.
   (1) Under the conventional view of real marginal cost, the loglinear macroeconomic model
produces little persistence in the eﬀect of monetary shocks because marginal cost is highly
sensitive to output.
   (2) Under our alternative view of real marginal cost, the loglinear macroeconomic model
suggests that there can be important persistence. When a monetary shock has a total output
multiplier of 3, only .5 of the output eﬀect occurs in the Þrst period with the bulk of the
eﬀects occurring in subsequent periods.
   (3) Within our alternative view of real marginal cost, the materials input share and the
general degree of factor elasticity work as mutually reinforcing mechanisms to lower the
elasticity of marginal cost with respect to output and to increase the extent of persistence.
   But an important subtheme of the Chari, Kehoe and McGrattan [2000] article is that
results in simple loglinear macroeconomic models can easily disappear in fully articulated
dynamic models that feature intertemporal mechanisms, such as capital accumulation. To
explore this idea and to more consistently model the nature of linkages in intertemporal
general equilibrium, we now develop a fully articulated macroeconomic model.

4. Structure of a fully articulated macro model

The fully articulated macroeconomic model features the structural elements highlighted
above, but is based on careful microeconomic foundations. Our discussion highlights three
key ingredients of our model, treating each in a separate subsection: the nature of dynamic
pricing given marginal cost; the eﬀect of materials input on marginal cost; and the eﬀect of
factor supply on marginal cost.

4.1. Dynamic Pricing

In Dotsey, King and Wolman [1999], we described a model of Þrm pricing that (i) high-
lights the roles of monopolistic competition and price stickiness stressed by New Keynesian
economics; (ii) is ßexible enough to handle a wide range of time-dependent pricing models
(including that of Calvo [1983] and the models in the style of Taylor [1980]) as well as a new
state-dependent pricing model; and (iii) is operational in that it can be integrated easily into
a complete general equilibrium model. In this subsection, we give a quick summary of that
approach.
   As is standard in the literature, we assume that each Þrm j faces a demand curve for
its product which takes the constant elasticity form (as in Blanchard-Kiyotaki [1987], and
Rotemberg [1987]):
                                              Pjt
                                      djt = ( )−ε dt
                                              Pt
where Pjt is the Þrm’s nominal price, Pt is the price level, ε is the elasticity of demand and
dt is an aggregate demand shifter that will be discussed further below.
    Some key features of pricing adjustment frictions in our economy are highlighted in Figure
4.1, which is taken from Dotsey et al [1999] with slight modiÞcation. Within each period,
some Þrms will adjust their price and all adjusting Þrms will choose the identical value,
which we call Pt∗ . We now assume that there is a discrete distribution of Þrms, with Þrms
                                                                   ∗
of type j having last set their price j periods ago at the level Pt−j , so that we refer to j as
the vintage of the price. At the start of each period, there is a discrete distribution of Þrms,
with fractions θjt (j = 1, 2, .., J). If these Þrms do not adjust at date t, they will continue
            ∗ 13
to charge Pt−j . In period t, a fraction 1 − η jt of vintage j Þrms decides to adjust its price,
and a fraction η jt decides not to adjust its price (all vintage J Þrms choose to adjust). The
total fraction of adjusting Þrms (ω 0t ) satisÞes
                                                   J
                                                   X
                                            ω 0t =   (1 − η jt )θjt .                      (4.1)
                                                       j=1

                                                       PJ
      Since all Þrms are in one of these situations,     i=1      θit = 1.

                                                             14
There are corresponding fractions of Þrms,

                                                    ω jt = η jt · θjt ,                                         (4.2)

that maintain during period t the price which they previously set in period t − j. These “end
of period” fractions are useful because they serve as weights in various aggregation contexts
throughout the paper. For example, the perfect price level index is given by

                                                 " J−1                    # 1−ε
                                                                             1
                                                  X            ¡ ∗ ¢1−ε
                                          Pt =           ω jt · Pt−j              ,                             (4.3)
                                                   j=0

in this economy. The “beginning of period” fractions are mechanically related to the “end
of period” fractions:


                                      θj+1,t+1 = ω jt for j = 0, 1, ..., J − 1.                                 (4.4)

    Time dependent models: If the adjustment fractions η j are treated as Þxed through time,
as in our analysis of section 5.1 below, then Figure 4.1 summarizes the mechanics of models
of randomized price-setting opportunities like those time-dependent models developed by
Calvo [1983] and Levin [1991].14 In this interpretation, ηj plays two roles: it is the fraction
of Þrms given the opportunity to adjust within a period and it is also the probability of an
individual Þrm being allowed to adjust after j periods, conditional on not having adjusted
for j − 1 periods.
   State dependent models: When we consider state dependent pricing in section 5.5 below,
we employ randomized Þxed costs of adjustment to induce discrete adjustment by individual
Þrms, while allowing for an adjustment rate that responds smoothly to the aggregate state
of the economy.
   But in both the time dependent and state dependent settings the Þrm’s optimal pricing
decision can be described using a dynamic programming approach. Since it must choose
between continuing with a Þxed nominal price, which implies a relative price of pt , and
paying a Þxed cost of adjusting its price (ξ), the representative Þrm solves
                                      (                                                                 )

where     λt
                is the ratio of future to current marginal utility and is the appropriate discount
factor for future real proÞts. The relative price of a Þrm that last set its price j periods
                        ∗
ago would be pt = (Pt−j    /Pt ) and real proÞts are given by π(pt ) = (pt ) · dt − ψ t · dt =
 14
      Calvo assumes that ηj = η, whereas Levin allows ηj to depend on j, as we do below.


                                                            15
[(pt )1−ε − ψ t · (pt )−ε ]dt .15 For the state dependent setting, a smooth macro model is obtained
in Dotsey, King and Wolman [1999] by assuming that there is a continuous distribution
of Þnite Þxed menu costs of changing prices across a large number of Þrms. In the time
dependent case, the Þxed cost is either zero or inÞnite depending on when the Þrm last
changed its price.
       The dynamic program (4.5) implies that the optimal price satisÞes an Euler equation
that involves balancing pricing eﬀects on current and expected future proÞts. That is, as
part of an optimal plan, Þrms that reset their price will choose a price that satisÞes
                                                             ∗ Pt
                                 ∂π(pt )       λt+1 ∂v(pt Pt+1 , ξ t+1 )

                                  ∂pt           λt        ∂p∗t
Further, for any given state of the economy there is a unique cutoﬀ price adjustment cost
that faces each Þrm charging a relative price of p. All Þrms that draw an adjustment cost
less than this cutoﬀ will optimally choose to adjust their price. Thus, in the state dependent
model there will be an endogenous fraction of Þrms from each vintage, (1 − η jt ) that will
choose to adjust their price. And because all price adjusters face the same dynamic program
going forward, they will choose an identical price. Also, as long as the inßation rate is non-
zero and the maximum adjustment cost is Þnite, there will be a maximum number of periods
that any Þrm will leave its price unchanged. Thus the state space for this problem is Þnite.
    Iterating the Euler equation (4.6) forward, the optimal relative price, p∗t , can be written
as an explicit function of current and expected future variables:
                      PJ−1 j                                                             ε

where (ω j,t+,j /ω 0,t ) = ηj,t+j · η j−1,t+j−1 · ... · η 1,t+1 is the probability of non-adjustment from
t through t + j. The pricing rule (4.7) is a natural generalization of the type derived in time-
dependent settings with exogenous adjustment probabilities that are constant through time
as in Calvo [1983] (see for example King and Wolman [1996] and Yun [1996]). According to
                                                                                             ε
(4.7), the optimal relative price is a Þxed markup over real marginal cost (p∗ =            ε−1
                                                                                                ψ)   if real
marginal cost and the price level are expected to be constant over time. More generally, (4.7)
illustrates that the optimal price varies with current and expected future demands, aggregate
price levels, real marginal costs, discount factors, and adjustment probabilities. All except
the last are also present in time-dependent models. Intuitively, Þrms know that the price
they set today may also apply in future periods, so the expected state of the economy in
  15
    In writing out the problem we have, for convenience, suppressed explicit notation of the state of the
economy. John and Wolman [2000] show that there is a unique bounded function v(p, ξ) that satisÞes 4.5.


                                                   16
those future periods aﬀects the price that they choose today. If, for example, marginal cost
is expected to be high next period a Þrm will set a high price in the current period, so as
not to sell at a loss next period. Similarly, if demand is expected to be high next period, the
Þrm will set a higher price today so that one period of inßation leaves it closer to maximizing
static proÞts next period. The conditional probability terms (ω j,t+,j /ω 0,t ) are present in time-
dependent models, but they are not time-varying. In our setup, these conditional probability
terms eﬀectively modify the discount factor in a time-varying manner: a high probability
of adjustment in some future period leads the Þrm to set a price that heavily discounts the
eﬀects on proÞts beyond that period.
   Dotsey, King and Wolman [1999] discuss how the price setting (4.7) and price level (4.3)
may be loglinearly approximated around a zero inßation steady state to generate expressions
that specialize to (3.2) and (3.1) when the probability of price Þxity is exogenous, constant
over time, and equal to η j at horizon j. So our simple model of section 3 is in the spirit of
the approach that we take in the remainder of the paper.

4.2. Materials input, marginal cost, and aggregation

We now turn to detailed development of the materials input linkages in our model. We have
previously outlined the eﬀects of material inputs on marginal cost in section 2 above, so
that the current discussion concentrates on the microeconomic structure of materials input
linkages and aggregation with materials inputs.

4.2.1. Microeconomic structure of materials

We think of all Þrms as buying units of the materials aggregate x from an “intermediary”
who assembles these from the products of individual Þrms of various types. We assume that
this Þrm has technology
                                              XJ−1
                                                               1
                                        xt = [     ω jt bϑjt ] ϑ
                                                j=0

where bjt is the amount of product j that the intermediary demands from each Þrm of type
j. Cost minimization on the part of the intermediary leads to
                                                   Pjt 1
                                         bjt = [       ] ϑ−1 xt
                                                   Pxt
and
                                            XJ−1          ϑ
                                                              ϑ−1
                                     Pxt = [     ω jt Pjtϑ−1 ] ϑ
                                              j=0




                                                    17
We also assume that the materials aggregator has the same demand elasticities as the con-
                                                   1
sumption and investment aggregators (so that −ε = ϑ−1 ): a simple story is that all consumers
and investors desire the same Þnal good assembled by the intermediary. This assumption
also implies that Pxt = Pt . Hence, the microeconomic model delivers the implication — used
above in our analysis of marginal cost — that the relative price Pxt /Pt is constant.

4.2.2. Aggregation

If Þrms of type j purchase quantity xjt of the materials aggregate, then the intermediary’s
resource constraint is
                                                         XJ−1
                                                   xt = [     ω jt xjt ]
                                                           j=0
                           P                                   PJ−1
and its total expenditure [ J−1
                            j=0 ω jt Pjt bjt ] = Pxt xt = Pxt [ j=0 ω jt xjt ].
   All Þrms of type j will have total demand given as

                                                       g                   s
                                    bjt + cjt + ijt = yjt = G(xjt , njt , kjt )

Notice that xjt is the local demand for the materials aggregate, while bjt is the materials
demand for the local product.
   Under constant returns to scale and global factor markets, we can deÞne aggregate gross
output as in Yun [1996] and, because all Þrms choose the same factor input ratios, it is
consistent with an aggregate gross output production function.

                                               XJ−1
                                       ytg   =[           g
                                                    ω jt yjt ] = G(xt , nt , kts )
                                                 j=0

However, this real quantity does not correspond to national output measures. To obtain
these, we want to net out materials to generate an aggregate measure of value-added. To
this end, adding up across all of the markets, we get that
             J−1

                                                                             XJ−1
                                                                                            g

             j=0                                j=0                            j=0

where the right-hand side is the desired measure of nominal value added. To express this
in real terms, we can divide through by the perfect price index and use the aggregation
properties of demand

                                                    XJ−1
                                                                   g
                                         ct + it = [     ω jt pjt yjt ] − xt ,
                                                        j=0


                                                            18
so that one way to measure aggregate real value-added is as consumption plus investment.
      More conventionally, looking at the Þrms’ payments, we have

                        J−1
                        X                g
                                                        J−1
                                                        X
                                                                                 s
                              ω jt [pjt yjt − xjt ] =         ω jt [wt njt + qt kjt + π jt ]
                        j=0                             j=0

so that aggregate value-added can also be described as a sum of wages plus capital income
plus proÞts.
   Finally, actual gnp calculations in the U.S. and other countries more closely resemble the
adding up of gross output less materials expenditures. For nominal gnp in our economy, this
would be:
                                            XJ−1
                                                            g
                                      Yt = [     ω jt (Pjt yjt − Pt xjt )]
                                             j=0

and for real gnp at benchmark relative prices of unity this would be:

                                XJ−1
                                            g
                          yt = [     ω jt (yjt − xjt )] = G(xt , nt , kts ) − xt
                                    j=0

An implicit price deßator would then derive from Yt = P t y t , so that ct + it = (P t /Pt )y t . For
our quantitative economies, though, we Þnd small variation in (P t /Pt ). Hence, while we use
ct + it to measure variations in real output, there would be small diﬀerences if we looked at
yt.

4.3. Factor Supply

In our model economy, we allow aggregate labor input to vary at both the extensive and
intensive margins, which can make the supply of labor services quite elastic. We also allow
for variable utilization of capital, which can in turn make the supply of capital services
fairly elastic. The following two subsections describe the key features of these supply-side
mechanisms.

4.3.1. Supply of Labor

In order to build a model in which some potential labor suppliers work while others do
not, we assume that each of a continuum of agents faces a random discrete cost of going to
work, which may be high or low in any particular period. To avoid having to carry along a
distribution of wealth, we assume that these risks are fully pooled.
   The labor supply behavior of the economy can then be studied by looking at a large
household, which maximizes

                                                        19
                                               X
                                 max {             β t [(et u(cet , lt ) + (1 − et )u(cot , 1)]}
                             cet ,ch
                                   t ,et ,lt   t

         subject to:   [et cet   + (1 − et )cht + ϕ(et ) + kt+1 ≤ [et wt (1 − lt ) + π t ] + qt kts − it

where e is the fraction of household members that participate in the work force, ce is the
consumption of workers, l is the leisure of workers, co is the consumption of nonworkers, ϕ
is a strictly increasing cost function of going to work, w is the wage rate, π are total proÞts
remitted by household owned Þrms, q is the rental rate on capital services, k s , and i is the
amount of investment expenditure.
   The utility function is of the class of functions discussed in King and Rebelo (1999).
SpeciÞcally,


                                 u(c, l) = (1/(1 − σ))[c1−σ v(1 − h)1−σ − 1]

where hours per employed worker are h = 1 − l. Basu and Kimball (2000) explore the useful-
ness of this class of utility functions for matching both long run properties of consumption
and leisure as well as for providing a better Þt for cyclical consumption behavior. We parame-
terize both the function ϕ, which governs the responsiveness of labor eﬀort, and the function
v, which controls the elasticity of labor at the intensive margin to match the empirical work
in Mulligan(1998). We also perform experiments where we alter these elasticities.

4.3.2. Capital use and accumulation

For simplicity, we think of households owning the stock of capital and renting its services to
Þrms at rental rate qt . The household’s income from renting services is qt kts = qt zt kt , where
zt is the utilization rate.
   The law of motion for the capital stock is given by


                                          kt+1 = (1 − δ(zt ))kt + µ(it /kt )kt

which reßects two inßuences. First, a higher utilization rate raises the depreciation rate on
capital, i.e., δ(z) is a positive, increasing and convex function of the utilization rate. Second,
there are costs associated with the rapid accumulation of capital: µ is positive and increasing
in i/k but there are diminishing returns (µ is concave). We have explored the eﬀects of two
diﬀerent models of investment adjustment costs, one in which the adjustment costs apply to
gross investment, as exposited here, and the other in which they apply to net investment, so
that the accumulation equation is modiÞed to kt+1 = [1 − δ(zt )]kt + µ[ kitt − δ(zt )]kt .

                                                               20
   It is useful to break the eﬃciency conditions into two parts: (i) those which govern labor
and consumption; and (ii) those which govern investment, utilization and capital accumula-
tion.
   Eﬃcient work eﬀort, participation, and consumption decisions require the following four
conditions, in which λt is the Lagrange multiplier on the household budget constraint. First,
the marginal utility of consumption by participating individuals and by non-participating
workers must be equated to the multiplier, as a condition of eﬃcient risk-sharing. Second,
hours per employed worker (ht ) are governed by the familiar requirement that the marginal
value of foregone leisure must be equal to the value of working. Third, the rate of participa-
tion (et ) is governed by the requirement that the utility cost of adding the marginal entering
worker must just be matched by the gain in terms of additional income, which is wh less the
consumption costs of going to work.


                                        (cet )−σ v(1 − ht )1−σ = λt                                      (4.8)
                                           (cot )−σ v(1)1−σ = λt                                         (4.9)
                                  (cet )1−σ v(1 − h)−σ v0 (1 − h) = λt wt                              (4.10)
    (1/(1 − σ))[−(cot )1−σ v(1) − (cet )1−σ v(1 − ht )1−σ ] = λt [wt ht − (cet − cht ) − ϕ0 (et )]     (4.11)

Taken together, these expressions determine a level of labor supply,

                                                 nt = ht et

that contains variations on both the intensive and extensive margins.
   An eﬃcient utilization rate equates the beneÞts of additional capital services, qt , with the
cost of replacing the worn out capital stock ν t δ 0 (zt ), where ν t is the Lagrange multiplier on
the capital accumulation constraint. As in many investment models, notably that of Hayashi
[1982], an eﬃcient rate of investment equates the current cost of the investment good λt to the
value of the change in the capital stock resulting from the additional investment (ν t φ0 (it /kt )).
Finally, an eﬃcient capital accumulation places restrictions on how capital’s shadow price ν t
evolves over time.


                                              qt λt = ν t δ 0 (zt )
                                             λt = ν t µ0 (it /kt )
   ν t = βEt ν t+1 {[(1 − δ(zt+1 )) + µ(it+1 /kt+1 )] − [(it+1 /kt+1 )µ0 (it+1 /kt+1 ) + δ 0 (zt+1 )zt+1 ]}

Our introductory model simply assumed that log(qt /q) = ξ log(zt /z). Approximating the

                                                      21
Þrst of these eﬃciency conditions, yields log(qt /q) = ξ log(zt /z)+[log(ν t /ν)−log(λt /λ)].with
ξ = zδ 00 /δ0 so that ξ is linked to the rate at which depreciation costs rise with use. Similarly,
approximating the second eﬃciency condition yields

                                                   (i/k)µ00
                        log λt /λ = log ν t /ν +            [log(it /i) − log(kt /k)]
                                                      µ0
This indicates that our introductory model’s approximation may not be too bad if investment
adjustment costs are small, in the sense that µ is nearly linear in i/k.

4.4. Calibration

The calibration of many of the model’s parameters is fairly standard. This section therefore
concentrates on elements that are novel to this investigation.
       Labor ratios: The parameters of the household’s preferences and its cost of going to work
function were set to achieve a participation rate of seventy percent (e = .70) and the average
hours per population member was twenty percent of available time (based on King, Plosser
and Rebelo [1988] calculations). This implies that steady state hours per worker was .29 of
available time.
    Consumption smoothing: We assume that σ = 3, which involves less intertemporal sub-
stitution than the log utility speciÞcation that is frequently employed in the literature. The
idea that there is less substitution or more risk aversion than log utility is supported by
many empirical studies.
   Utilization and investment adjustment costs: Elasticity of marginal depreciation costs,
ξ = zδ 00 /δ0 , set equal to unity based on Basu and Kimball [1997].16
    Production function share parameters: We set the steady state ratio of materials inputs
to gross output x/y g = 2/3 and labor’s share of value-added to two thirds.
    Production function elasticities: Various empirical studies suggest that there is a small
elasticity of substitution between materials inputs and value-added, so we make the bench-
mark elasticity of substitution equal one-tenth (close to Þxed proportions). We follow many
studies in assuming the benchmark model has unit elasticity of substitution between labor
and capital, i.e., that it is Cobb-Douglas.
  16
    We also make investment adjustment costs apply to net rather than gross investment. The practical
eﬀect of adjustment costs applied to gross investment is to make marginal costs rise with utilization for
another reason besides the depreciation mechanism studied in the current analysis.




                                                     22
5. Persistence in the fully articulated model

In this section, we discuss how the fully articulated economy responds to the same sort of
monetary disturbance discussed previously in the simple model economy of section 3.

5.1. Price stickiness

For most of this section we assume that price adjustment is time dependent, speciÞcally that
there is exogenous price stickiness of the form shown in Table 5.1. The degree of price rigidity
is described by the nonadjustment rates (η) and stationary fractions (ω). In our setting, no
Þrm holds its price Þxed for more than four periods (J = 4) and some adjust more frequently.
One way to more precisely gauge the degree of price stickiness is to calculate the average
age of a price in the economy at the end of each period, ω 0 1 + ω 2 2 + ω 3 3 + ω 4 4. Using the
numbers in Table 5.1, this average is 1.98, so that a random visit to a Þrm in the economy
would conclude that it had a two quarter old price. In a Tayloresque model, such as those
studied by Chari, Kehoe and McGrattan [2000], our speciÞcation would be similar to a J = 3
model since that would deliver a nearly identical average price age (since 13 (1 + 2 + 3) = 2).
In assessing the degree of price stickiness associated with this number, it is important to
stress that our simulations of the simple and fully articulated models assume that p∗ is set
after the monetary shock takes place. Thus, there is complete neutrality if prices are Þxed
for one quarter.



                          Table 5.1
                   j      Nonadjustment Rate (η) Stationary Fraction (ω)
                   0                             .41
                   1      .73                           .30
                   2      .62                           .19
                   3      .45                           .10



   The nonadjustment probabilities in Table 5.1 are related to other numbers involved in
a Þrm’s price setting. These numbers are the probabilities that a currently adjusting Þrm
attaches to the time that its price will be Þxed: the probability of holding the price Þxed for
exactly one period is (1 − η 1 ); for exactly two periods is η 1 (1 − η 2 ), for exactly three periods




                                                 23
is η1 η2 (1 − η 3 ) and for exactly four periods is η 1 η2 η3 . Thus, the expected duration of price
stickiness may be shown to be 2.41 quarters in our model.17
       These numbers were obtained from assuming—as in Dotsey, King and Wolman [1999]—
a particular distribution function for adjustment costs as well as a steady state inßation
rate of .3% (three-tenths of one percent per year). This distribution involves a maximum
adjustment cost parameter implying that the highest cost faced by a Þrm adjusting its price
is just over .01 percent of its quarterly wage bill (one-one hundredth of a percent of its wage
costs). Given the small steady state inßation rate, these very small adjustment costs were
enough to produce a price distribution spread out over a year as displayed in Table 5.1.
       In the simple model of section 3, we used the Calvo adjustment speciÞcation, in which
there is a probability of adjustment that is constant through time and with respect to
length of time since last price adjustment.18 Wolman [2000] has shown that there can
be important quantitative diﬀerences in the dynamics of inßation when one uses a rising
marginal probability of price adjustment and a maximum period of price Þxity, each of
which seems more realistic to us than the Calvo speciÞcation. Our strategy is to initially Þx
the ω 0 s at their steady state levels, exploring time-dependent pricing models in sections 5.2
and 5.3. We then turn to a fully state dependent pricing model in section 5.5 below.

5.2. Persistence under the standard view

Figure 5.1 highlights the fact that there is only a small impact eﬀect of money on real activity
and there is little persistence in real economic activity, when marginal cost is governed by
the standard view. This is a special case of our model in this section which abstracts from
materials inputs and capacity utilization. It also uses a relatively small labor elasticity
  17
       This can be easily computed, as follows:

                        D   = (1 − η1 ) + 2 ∗ η1 (1 − η2 ) + 3 ∗ η1 η2 (1 − η3 ) + 4 ∗ η 1 η2 η 3
                                   ω1          ω 1 ω2             ω2 ω3              ω3
                            = [1 −     ]+2∗[        −     ]+3∗[        −     ]+4∗
                                   ω0          ω 0 ω0             ω0 ω0              ω0
                                   ω1 ω2 ω3            1
                            = 1+      +      +      =
                                   ω0 ω0 ω0            ω0
  18
    We are building in somewhat more price stickiness than we did in our simple model above. For that
economy, the average age of a price was two quarters and the average duration of price Þxity was also two
quarters. In the Calvo model, the average age of a price is found as
                                                                             1
                                     S = (1 − η)[1 + 2η + 3η2 + ...] =
                                                                            1−η
and the expected duration of newly set price may be found using the same recipe as the previous footnote
and using the fact that ω 0 = (1 − η). Hence, it is the same as the average age of the price in the Calvo
model.


                                                          24
with respect to the wage (of .4), which is suggested by empirical evidence pertaining to the
response of man-hours on the intensive margin. This replicates the Þndings of Chari, Kehoe
and McGrattan [2000] for our time-dependent speciÞcation of price stickiness with weights
from Table 5.1.
       The price level moves substantially on impact (an increase of over .8) even though only
41% of the Þrms are adjusting). The amount of price level movement occurs because price
adjusting Þrms choose to raise their prices more than one-for-one with the money stock. In
terms of the dynamics of output, the impact eﬀect is 0.19 and the total multiplier is .39.
The mean lag is 1.86 quarters, which is not too diﬀerent from what was produced by our
simple model of section 3.
       Also, with this parameterization, the production structure requires that labor input is
substantially more volatile than output. The real rental rate, the real wage rate and real
marginal cost rise dramatically in response to the monetary disturbance: the 0.19 percent
increase in output and the .3 percent increase in labor input lead to a rise in real marginal
cost that is over one percent. Hence, an initial rise in real marginal cost and an initial
interval of high expected inßation motivates Þrms to raise their prices aggressively. Those
Þrms which can adjust their price do so by nearly the full amount of the long-run two percent
increase, as shown by the P ∗ series in the Þnal panel of Figure 5.1
    The fully articulated model involves an explicit decomposition of output into investment
and consumption. In this simulation, investment adjustment costs are set equal to zero
so as to generate an impact eﬀect on investment that is three times the impact eﬀect on
consumption. In this regard, we are following the spirit — but not the details — of the
approach taken in CKM [2000].19 Because the output eﬀects of the disturbance are largely
transitory, it is not too surprising that these mainly aﬀect investment, since the permanent
income theory suggests that consumption should be smoothed. In our fully articulated
model, though, the nonseparable nature of preferences over consumption and leisure means
that individuals demand more consumption during periods of high work, given wealth and
intertemporal substitution eﬀects associated with changes in the path of real interest rates.20
That is, our model contains the mechanisms which Baxter and Jermann [1999] and Basu
and Kimball [2000] have suggested explain apparent “excess sensitivity” of consumption to
  19
    CKM [2000] specify a quadratic investment adjustment cost model, with costs depending on net invest-
ment. They adjust the single free parameter of that speciÞcation so that the response of investment relative
to output — speciÞcally the relative standard deviation of HP Þltered data from the model–matches that in
the U.S. data.

  20
    The series “basic consumption” graphed in Figure 6.1 shows how consumption responds as a result of
wealth and interest rate eﬀects if manhours are Þxed. This series plays no other role in this model version.


                                                    25
income over the business cycle.

5.3. Persistence with real ßexibilities

Figure 5.2 highlights the fact that there is an important impact eﬀect of money on real
activity and there is substantial persistence in real economic activity, when marginal cost is
based on a supply-side with real ßexibilities and using the same degree of exogenous price
stickiness. This benchmark model has the following structural characteristics: a materials
inputs share of 2/3, variability of capacity utilization (an elasticity of the rental rate to the
rental price of unity), and substantial labor supply variation. The larger labor elasticity
arises from responses along the extensive margin: speciÞcally, there is a Frisch labor supply
elasticity of 2 for total hours, which involves an elasticity of .4 in hours per employed worker
and of 1.6 in terms of employment.21
   Turning to the details shown in Figure 5.2, the price level moves only by about .36
percent in response to a one percent monetary expansion on impact, even though 41% of the
Þrms are free to adjust their prices. The smaller response exhibited in this setting occurs
because price adjusting Þrms now choose to raise their prices less than one-for-one with the
money stock. There is an impact eﬀect on real output of .64 percent and a total multiplier
of 3.6, which is distributed over eight quarters. The elongated impulse response is reßected
in a larger mean lag of 2.70, a lag that is similar to the one displayed by the simple model
of section 3. More generally, we Þnd that there is a uniform message from the small log-
linear and large model with micro-foundations: real ßexibilities on the supply side lead to
quantitatively large amounts of persistence.
    The benchmark model also seems more closely in accord with other aspects of business
cycles. All of the factors of production — materials, total hours, and capacity utilization —
rise roughly one-for-one with output. Materials do so because they have a low substitution
elasticity (about one-tenth); hours and capacity utilization do so because they are supplied
with substantial and similar elasticities so that little factor substitution takes place even
though the value-added production function is Cobb-Douglas. The real rental rate and the
real wage rate rise by a similar amount,
   Marginal cost moves by one-third as much as the average of the real factor rental rates
because the share of value added in total costs is one-third. Judging again from impact
eﬀects, the elasticity of real marginal cost with respect to output is about .2 (the impact
eﬀect on marginal cost is about .12 and the impact eﬀect on output is about .6). Since
  21
     There is, of course, a smaller general equilibrium labor supply elasticity because consumption rises in
response to the monetary disturbance. Judging from the relative height of impact eﬀects, this elasticity is
slightly greater than unity, because the real wage rises by about .5 while labor and output rises by over .6.


                                                     26
real marginal cost does not rise dramatically in response to the monetary disturbance, Þrms
which can adjust their price do so much less aggressively than in the previous experiment.
       Turning to the decomposition of output into investment and consumption, investment is
again three times as volatile as output on impact since we imposed this in our calibration
of (net) investment adjustment. Given that the disturbance is more persistent, there are
larger eﬀects on wealth and the path of real interest rates that motivate adjustments in
consumption: these channels are reßected in the path of “basic consumption” in our model,
which is the consumption of individuals not employed. Total consumption is more responsive
to the shock for two related reasons: the marginal utility condition (4.8) mandates that more
consumption be allocated to individuals who are either working harder on the intensive
margin or moving into employment.

5.4. A recurrent interest rate puzzle

In both Figures 5.1 and 5.2, there is substantial expected inßation, which is an inevitable
result of short-run price stickiness coupled with a higher long-run path of the price level.
The total necessary rise in the price level is about 1.67%, which is distributed over an eight
quarter adjustment interval. The extent of expected inßation is highest earliest in the impulse
response, so that the upward pressure on the nominal interest rate is greatest at that time.
This degree of expected inßation results in a rise in the nominal interest rate in response
to expansionary monetary policy. That is: the model fails to produce a liquidity eﬀect in
response to this particular monetary disturbance.22

5.5. Persistence with state dependent pricing

There is considerable persistence with the alternative view of marginal cost even when pricing
is state dependent, as is shown in Figure 5.3. This Þgure is constructed under the assumption
that Þrms face a distribution of real adjustment costs, with small values of the highest
adjustment cost as previously discussed.
   There are some aspects of the dynamic responses illustrated in Figure 5.3 which are very
predictable: there is a smaller impact eﬀect of money on output, (.51 rather than .64), which
is consistent with the idea that state dependent pricing is inevitably less sticky than time
dependent pricing. There is also a smaller total eﬀect (2.50 rather than 3.40) which is again
  22
    Keen [2000] explores the extent to which Þnancial market frictions can produce a liquidity eﬀect in
combination with sticky prices, as well as reviewing prior literature on this topic. While he imbeds the
standard view of marginal cost in his models, it would be interesting to explore the power of liquidity eﬀect
mechanisms using our view of marginal cost.



                                                     27
consistent with a smaller amount of stickiness. But there is considerable persistence, as
reßected in the total multiplier and a mean lag of 2.68.
   Other aspects of the dynamic responses are less intuitive: there is no longer a “hump
shaped” eﬀect of money on output and there are other non-monotonicities in the impulse
responses. These Þndings warrant two observations. First, the smooth impulse responses
in the time dependent economy displayed in Figure 5.2 are perhaps surprising themselves:
staggered pricing mechanically imparts a moving average structure to dynamics (as displayed
in Figure 4.1), but this is smoothed out by the dynamics of the forcing process and the
cautious nature of individual pricing responses. Second, in experimentation with models
along these lines, we have found that the details of impulse responses in state dependent
pricing frameworks are somewhat more fragile than in time dependent frameworks.
   While there are some aspects of the state dependent pricing results which warrant fur-
ther investigation, it is important that a key Þnding not be overlooked: our production-side
mechanisms allow considerable persistence when there is state dependent pricing. Other
mechanisms for generating persistence in time dependent models, such as the factor speciÞci-
ties discussed by Kimball [1995] and Rotemberg [1996], may not survive in a state dependent
pricing setting. Kimball and Rotemberg stress that factor speciÞcities mean that Þrms which
currently adjust pricing have low output and low marginal cost, so that they are less ag-
gressive in their price-setting than if factors can ßexibly be reallocated. But, symmetrically,
Þrms that are not adjusting prices have high output and high marginal cost: they would pay
a great deal to adjust their prices.

5.6. Robustness to details of production structure

In this section we investigate how the core components of our “real ßexibilities” view con-
tribute to overall persistence. The basic summary statistics on output responses–impact
multiplier, total multiplier and mean lag–are displayed in Table 5.2, which also describes
the cases and the location of additional Þgure information. Comparing sum of the lagged
responses as well as the mean lag generated by the various perturbations with those of the
standard model, one sees that all three core components: materials inputs, elastic labor
supply on the extensive margin, and variable utilization of capital contribute to greater
persistence.

   Additional detail on model implications is provided in Figure 5.4, which graphs output
and marginal cost for cases (1-5), building up to the benchmark case 6 that is also displayed
in Figure 5.2. Figure 5.4.A is the output and marginal cost responses in the CKM [2000]
case that has already been displayed in Figure 5.1 and its parameterization has already been
described in the text. Figure 5.4.B. sets the material share equal to zero while retaining labor
supply on the extensive margin and variable capacity utilization, with the same elasticities
as in the benchmark model: there is a marginal cost elasticity of about .40 in this case.23
Figure 5.4.C keeps a materials share of two-thirds, but eliminates labor supply elasticity on
the extensive margin and variable capacity utilization: it illustrates why some researchers
have thought that reasonable materials input shares would not, by themselves, generate a
substantial amount of persistence.24 Figure 5.4D is obtained simply by eliminating variable
capital utilization from our benchmark: it shows that the combination of materials input and
elastic labor supply can generate a small elasticity of marginal cost with respect to output
(about .3) and substantial persistence. But, as we have stressed earlier, the Þxed capital
stock implies that labor is much more volatile than output in this case. Figure 5.5E displays
the case with materials input and utilization, but without labor supply elasticity on the
extensive margin. Finally, Figure 5.5F is the benchmark model, also shown in Figure 5.2,
that has an elasticity of marginal cost with respect to output of about .2. Taken together,
the panels of this Þgure indicates how each structural feature, in turn, dampens the response
of marginal cost to output and, hence, draws out the response of output to a monetary shock.
  23
    This corresponds to a case that we studied previously in Dotsey, King and Wolman [1997].
  24
    For example, it is apparently for this reason that Bergin and Feenstra [2000] are led to explore the
inßuence of demand speciÞcations that diﬀer from the CES form employed here.

5.7. Interest rates and money demand

We have seen that a recurrent feature of the model economies displayed in Figures 5.1, 5.2
and 5.3 is the rise in the nominal interest rate when there is a positive monetary injection.
Previously, we traced this Þnding to two properties of the model. First, there is a substantial
rise in expected inßation, which must occur because there is short-run price stickiness coupled
with a long-run rise in the price level. Second, there are relatively small variations in the
real rate of interest.
    We now introduce an interest-sensitive money demand function, written in a semiloga-
rithmic form
                                 log Mt − log Pt = log yt − ζRt

We do not derive this relationship from an underlying microeconomic speciÞcation of pref-
erences or transactions costs. Instead, our approach relies on the idea explicitly derived
movements in monetized exchange typically imply small variations in (i) resource costs of
using alternative media and (ii) in substitution eﬀects arising from “wedges of monetary
ineﬃciency.” Experiments with many optimizing models of money demand have convinced
us that this is a good approximation; it also has the added feature that any consequences of
altering the demand for money can be traced directly to its implications for the behavior of
aggregate demand, as in the IS-LM model.
    To think about the issues, start with our benchmark model in Figure 5.2 that sets the
interest sensitivity of money demand (ζ) equal to zero. In this case, there is a given rise in
net output (call it log(y0b )), the price level, and an associated rise in the nominal interest
rate (call it Rtb ). Now, suppose that we raise ζ from zero to some positive number: what
is wrong with our prior solution? There is now an excess supply of money, because money
demand is lower given that the monetary shock raises the nominal interest rate. Hence, any
new solution must move in the direction of: (i) a higher output level, so as to raise the real
demand for money; (ii) a higher price level, so as to reduce the real supply of money; or (iii)
a lower nominal interest rate, so as to raise the real demand for money.
    These three responses are all mutually consistent. First, a higher output level automati-
cally increases the demand for money, reducing the excess supply. Second, a higher output
level raises real marginal cost and encourages Þrms to increase their prices, so that there will
be a greater rise in the price level. Third, given that there is a higher initial price level, there
is less expected inßation which must take place in order to reach the higher long-run price
level. In sum, the rise in the nominal rate means that there is an additional aggregate de-
mand stimulus in the model (exactly the opposite of the standard IS-LM model’s cushioning
of aggregate demand).


                                                30
  Figures 5.5 and 5.6 illustrate the dynamic eﬀects of a monetary shock in our benchmark
model of section 5.2, using values of ζ = 1 and ζ = 8.25 These graphs show that the
introduction of interest-sensitive money demand has the eﬀects discussed above, yielding a
substantially larger impact eﬀect of money on output. SpeciÞcally, the impact eﬀects on
output and the price level of a one percent monetary change are .95 and .38 in Figure 5.5
with ζ R = 1, as compared to the benchmark values of .64 and .36 in Figure 5.2. There is
also a smaller rise in the nominal interest rate. With a greater interest-sensitivity (ζ = 8),
there are larger eﬀects of money on output and prices as shown in Figure 5.6: here the
impact eﬀects are 1.39 and .43 respectively. Since these economies display a small elasticity
of marginal cost with respect to output, it is perhaps not too surprising that the bulk of
the eﬀect is concentrated on output rather than on prices. This is particularly true because
the interest-rate induced changes in the demand for money are transitory relative to the
dynamics displayed in Figure 5.2.
   Figures 5.5 and 5.6 also show the eﬀect of interest-sensitive money demand on the overall
shape and measure of persistence displayed by the impulse response function. For the smaller
interest sensitivity shown in Figure 5.5, the total eﬀect is larger (3.8) than for it was for the
benchmark case (3.4) shown in Figure 5.2, in which money demand was interest-insensitive.
There is however, less persistence with the mean lag falling to 2.38. These conclusions are
reinforced for the higher sensitivity, but persistence is not eliminated by interest-sensitive
money demand.
  The endogenous determination of consumption and investment in the fully articulated
model also means that the above discussion, which centered around the money demand
function is incomplete: the altered dynamic path of real activity now implies that there is a
much larger decline in the real interest rate displayed in Figures 5.5 and 5.6 than was present
in Figure 5.2.
  25
     Our money demand sensitivities are not large as those implicit in CKM [2000], who use an money
demand speciÞcation with an elasticity of .39 that is identiÞed from the long-run (low frequency) behavior
of real balances and the nominal interest rate. The semielasticity ζ is related to an elasticity ε via ζ = ε/R,
where R is the stationary interest rate. In our analysis, an annual nominal interest rate of 6% is a nominal
interest rate of .06/4 = .015 per quarter. Hence, ε = .39 corresponds to ζ = 26.
   We use more modest values, as in King and Watson [1996], because we believe that there is a smaller
short-run elasticity of money demand that is pertinent for business cycle analysis. The incorporation of a
money demand function with a distinction between short and long-run elasticities into business cycle models
is a promising line of research.

6. Summary and conclusions

One of the most intensively active areas of macro research over the last decade has been
the development of fully optimizing general equilibrium business cycle models that feature
imperfect competition and sticky prices. These models of the new neoclassical synthesis
can be used to evaluate the inßuences of monetary shocks and monetary policy rules on
economic activity, as real business cycle models were previously used to study the eﬀects of
productivity. Early eﬀorts to explore the empirical implications of these sticky price models
for the volatility and comovement of nominal and real aggregates, such as that of King and
Watson [1996], utilized the standard one sector production function employed in early real
business cycle research. These explorations were disappointing, in that simulations from
the sticky price models arguably performed much worse than benchmark real business cycle
models.
  Recently Chari, Kehoe, and McGrattan [2000] have stressed that such models contain a
substantial persistence problem. That is, monetary shocks have only transitory eﬀects on
real activity eﬀects that do not persist beyond the duration of the exogenously imposed price
Þxity. In this paper, we trace the persistence problem to the supply side of the standard
model, which makes marginal cost highly sensitive to changes in output, thus leading to
aggressive price responses by those Þrms that adjust prices.
   We incorporate empirically realistic real ßexibilities into the supply side of the macroeco-
nomic model by including important roles for materials inputs, variable capacity utilization,
and variation in employment along an extensive margin. These modiÞcations dramatically
reduce the elasticity of marginal cost with respect to output and thus lead to more gradual
price adjustment, which in turn implies greater persistence in economic activity. There are
additional gains to using this more realistic supply side, namely we are able to match other
empirical regularities that are at variance with the standard model. For example, our model
produces near one-for-one comovement of output, hours, and capacity utilization. This co-
movement is a direct outgrowth of the real ßexibilities view of the production side of the
model. In turn this view of production results in the model’s ability to generate persistent
responses of real activity to monetary shocks.
   Having shown the potential importance of supply-side real ßexibilities, we think that there
is important work to be done on reÞning estimates of crucial parameters—such as the elasticity
of employment response and capacity utilization—as well as exploring the robustness of our
results to alternative models of utilization and sectoral interrelationships in production. For
example, it seems clear that some materials prices are procyclical but that others are lagging.
   Other lines of macroeconomic research also may beneÞt from incorporating the real ßexi-


                                              32
bilities view taken in this paper. Some macroeconomists such as Ball and Romer [1990] have
added real wage rigidities into macroeconomic models that include nominal price rigidities
of the form studied in this paper. We interpret this approach as providing an alternative
explanation of why labor input is volatile while real wages are not. But if such approaches
are to generate one-for-one comovement of output and hours, then it seems that they must
incorporate variable capacity utilization. Further, even if real wage movements are modest,
marginal cost can still rise substantially if Þxed capital input leads to sharply diminish-
ing marginal products. Variable utilization and variable materials inputs serve to mitigate
the eﬀects of a largely predetermined capital stock. Therefore, taking a broader view of
production will enhance the empirical properties of models with real wage rigidities.
       Given that persistence need not be a problem for this class of models, research on quan-
titative general equilibrium models can now focus on some other important issues. First and
foremost is the puzzling behavior of the nominal interest rate, which rises in response to a
positive monetary shock. Thus the model fails to generate a liquidity eﬀect. Although there
is some empirical debate concerning the extent of this eﬀect and whether it is time varying
(see Gordon and Leeper [1993]), most economists believe that it is a feature of the economy.
A crucial ingredient in the model’s counterfactual response is that expected inßation rises
rapidly. Some increases in expected inßation at some horizons are inevitable because the
long run price level rises in response to the shock and the short run price level is fairly sticky.
Second, there is broad consensus that central banks use the interest rate rather than a money
stock as an instrument. As pointed out in Dotsey [2000a, 2000b], the form of these policy
rules has implications for the way the economy responds to monetary policy shocks. It is,
therefore, important to investigate whether monetary policy shocks give rise to persistent
macroeconomic ßuctuations when the central bank is following an interest rate rule. And
speciÞcally whether the liquidity eﬀect puzzle carries over to such a setting. Third, we have
studied the dynamic eﬀects of monetary policy shocks under the assumption that agents
correctly understand the persistent nature of the process generating the money supply and
the inßationary objectives of the central bank. In some post-war business cycle episodes this
assumption seems inappropriate, so that it appears important to examine dynamic responses
using alternative assumptions of expectations formation. Finally, we think that detailed em-
pirical appraisal of this class of models is essential and that the supply-side articulated in
this paper may improve their performance as positive models of business cycles.26
  26
   Sims [1997] reccomends the comparison of quantitative model impulse responses with those from esti-
mated vector authoregressions, which is a natural proposal for the models in this paper.
