ABSTRACT
Energy efficiency improvements “rebound” when economic responses undercut their direct
energy savings. I show that general equilibrium channels typically amplify rebound by making
consumption goods cheaper but typically dampen rebound by increasing demand for non-energy
inputs to production and by changing the size of the energy supply sector. Improvements in the
efficiency of the energy supply sector generate especially large rebound because they make
energy cheaper in all other sectors. Quantitatively, improving the efficiency of U.S. non-energy
supply sectors by 1% would reduce U.S. energy use by 0.58%, with rebound of 28%. General
equilibrium channels increase those savings by 19%; however, they reduce the savings from
improving the efficiency of the energy supply sector by 65%.

General Equilibrium Rebound

September 5, 2019

Introduction

Industrial economies have become much better at converting energy into useful work. For
instance, the energy intensity of U.S. output fell by 35% from 1985 to 2011,1 and the energy intensity of British output has fallen by 80% since 1850 (Fouquet and Pearson, 2003).
However, economists since Jevons (1865) have wondered whether improvements in energy
efficiency might actually increase aggregate use of energy resources. Further, environmental
economists have been especially concerned with the possibility of such large “rebound” effects because of the prominent externalities associated with energy use. Most formal analyses
of rebound effects have focused on partial equilibrium settings that hold some prices fixed.
Yet Jevons was especially worried about general equilibrium channels,2 and his concern has
been reinforced by computable general equilibrium models that suggest the potential for
strong rebound effects through “economy-wide” or “indirect” channels (Allan et al., 2009;
Turner, 2013). As a result, many have called for theoretical research to illuminate the channels through which economy-wide rebound arises (e.g., Dimitropoulos, 2007; Turner, 2013;
Borenstein, 2015).
I fill the gap in the theoretical literature by developing an analytically tractable general
equilibrium framework for studying the implications of improved energy efficiency. I disentangle the channels through which improvements in energy efficiency affect total energy
resource use and I sign the effect in a range of cases. The modeled economy contains an
arbitrary number of sectors that produce distinct consumption goods. In the baseline model,
each consumption good is produced competitively by combining a non-energy input (here
interpreted as labor) with energy resources, using a constant elasticity of substitution (CES)
technology. Each household values leisure and consumption. Households sell labor in return
for a wage. Energy resources are converted to useful work via energy conversion technologies
that are specific to each consumption good sector. Energy resources are themselves produced
by an additional sector that also employs a CES technology in energy resources and labor.
I study how an improvement in the quality of some sector’s energy conversion technology
affects prices and energy resource consumption throughout the economy.
An engineering estimate of the effects of an efficiency improvement would hold the production of energy services (e.g., useful work or lighting) fixed and calculate the energy resources
displaced by the improvement in efficiency. “Rebound” is the percentage of these engineering
savings lost through economic responses. A partial equilibrium analysis of rebound holds the
prices of consumption goods, energy resources, and labor fixed. In this case with fixed prices,
I show the result familiar from previous literature (e.g., Saunders, 1992; Sorrell and Dim1

https://energy.gov/eere/analysis/energy-intensity-indicators-highlights
Jevons (1865, VII p. 141) wrote, “Now, if the quantity of coal used in a blast-furnace, for instance, be
diminished in comparison with the yield, the profits of the trade will increase, new capital will be attracted,
the price of pig-iron will fall, but the demand for it increase; and eventually the greater number of furnaces
will more than make up for the diminished consumption of each.” This story hinges on changes in prices. I
will formally map it into an output price channel.

itropoulos, 2008): rebound is proportional to the elasticity of substitution between energy
resources and non-energy inputs to production. This elasticity captures how firms substitute
towards energy resources when improved technology reduces its effective cost. When energy
resources and non-energy inputs are gross substitutes in production (i.e., when this elasticity
is greater than 1), rebound is greater than 100%. In this case, an efficiency improvement is
said to “backfire,” actually increasing consumption of energy resources.
In general equilibrium, all prices adjust to the improved energy conversion technology.
Improving the technology in some sector k reduces the cost of producing that sector’s consumption good and thus reduces the equilibrium price of its consumption good. This lower
price reduces sector k’s demand for inputs, but households’ substitution towards sector k’s
newly cheap consumption good increases its scale and thus its demand for inputs. Sector k’s
changing demand for inputs affects aggregate demand for energy resources and labor. Any
change in aggregate demand for labor in turn affects hours of labor supplied and the wage.
And these changes in turn affect demand for all consumption goods (through changes in
income) and input costs for all consumption goods. Finally, the energy supply sector must
expand or contract to match any changes in resource demand from the consumption good
sectors. These expansions and contractions change the energy supply sector’s own demand
for energy resources and labor, with implications for energy resource use in all other sectors.
I show that sectoral elasticities of substitution between energy resources and non-energy
inputs are critical to general equilibrium rebound, which is consistent with computable general equilibrium models’ well-known sensitivity to these parameters (see Broberg et al.,
2015). However, I also highlight other critical parameters. For instance, computable general
equilibrium modelers typically do not emphasize (and even do not consistently report) the
elasticity of substitution between consumption good sectors. I show that this parameter’s
relation to unity and to sectoral elasticities of substitution is critical to the sign and magnitude of general equilibrium channels. I also show that the general equilibrium consequences
of the energy supply sector are especially important to evaluations of rebound. By amplifying other sectors’ changes in energy resource use, the energy supply sector’s responses can
increase energy savings even beyond what an engineering analysis would predict, a case of
negative rebound or “super-conservation” (Saunders, 2008).3
I use the new theoretical results to quantitatively investigate general equilibrium consequences of increased energy efficiency in the U.S. economy. Instead of calibrating a fully
specified computable general equilibrium model or restricting attention to partial equilibrium consequences estimable through program evaluation methods, I quantify and decom3

I also show that rebound can be especially severe when improved technology arises in the energy supply
sector. Because an improvement in the efficiency of energy production leads all other producers to substitute
towards energy resources, backfire occurs for a much broader set of conditions than when new technology
arises in some consumption good sector. This result formalizes and confirms the results of numerical models
that have emphasized rebound from the energy supply sector (see Allan et al., 2007; Sorrell, 2007; Hanley
et al., 2009; Turner, 2009).

pose general equilibrium consequences using knowledge only of factor shares and elasticities
of substitution. I find that simultaneously improving the efficiency of energy resource use
in all non-energy supply sectors by 1% reduces total energy resource use by 0.58%, with
rebound reducing engineering savings by nearly 30%. If not for the energy supply sector’s
response, general equilibrium channels would undercut energy resource savings by 1.5%; however, once we account for this response, general equilibrium considerations in fact increase
energy resource savings by an additional 19% beyond what a partial equilibrium analysis
would predict. Improved efficiency generates the greatest reductions in overall energy resource use when it arises in commercial real estate or construction, with the latter even
demonstrating negative rebound or “super-conservation”. Improved efficiency can backfire
when it arises in electronics, metals, or some transportation sectors. Consistent with the
theoretical analysis, the energy supply sector demonstrates the most rebound (80%) of any
sector that does not backfire. In this case, general equilibrium effects reduce energy resource
savings, as a partial equilibrium analysis would estimate rebound of only 42%. The recently
proposed Affordable Clean Energy rule aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by increasing the efficiency of U.S. coal-fired power plants, but these results give reason to doubt that
the emission reductions would be meaningful (see also Keyes et al., 2019).
I extend the setting to investigate the consequences of endogenous innovation and of costly
improvements to energy efficiency. First, I incorporate a modern model of directed technical
change (Acemoglu, 2002, 2007) in order to assess whether profit-maximizing innovation is
likely to focus on sectors that are especially vulnerable to rebound. I show that the marginal
research firm typically reduces overall energy resource use if, as in standard calibrations,
labor and energy resources are complements in production and the various consumption
goods are complements in utility.
Second, I explore the general equilibrium consequences of improvements in efficiency
that come at the cost of disrupting other factors’ productivity. Such costs may be especially
important when improved efficiency is mandated by policy.4 I show that if technologies
are costly and the value share of labor is much larger than that of energy resources (as is
true of many sectors of the U.S. economy), then many of the general equilibrium channels
switch sign. In the quantitative application, these channels could now combine to reduce
energy resource use. Further, a new general equilibrium channel tends to reinforce partial
equilibrium changes in energy resource use. Accounting for the cost of improved energy
efficiency is therefore likely to increase energy resource savings beyond those estimated in the
quantitative application, potentially even driving a number of sectors to negative rebound.
Experiments with computable general equilibrium models have in fact demonstrated these
effects (Allan et al., 2007, 2009; Broberg et al., 2015).

A large literature models environmental regulations as reducing factor productivity (e.g., Marten et al.,
2019). Intermediate results obtained for the analysis of costly efficiency policies are also informative about
the general equilibrium consequences of these policies.

There are only a few other analytic general equilibrium studies of rebound effects.5 Wei
(2007) restricts attention to a single energy good and a single non-energy good, assumes
Cobb-Douglas functional forms for all production functions, and analyzes a linear demand
system. Wei (2010) considers a setting with only a single consumption good and does
not model the production of energy. Concurrently with the present paper, Böhringer and
Rivers (2018) and Fullerton and Ta (2019) use linearization techniques to study settings
with one or two consumption goods. By explicitly solving for energy resource use in a dual
setting that treats prices as independent variables, my analysis demonstrates precisely which
price changes generate each general equilibrium channel and thus further develops intuition
for general equilibrium consequences. Further, whereas Böhringer and Rivers (2018) allow
only a single general equilibrium channel at a time, I capture interactions between multiple
general equilibrium channels. And whereas Fullerton and Ta (2019) study improvements
in the efficiency with which households use energy, I study improvements in firms’ energy
efficiency, which are important both because households represent only 36% of U.S. energy
use and because the computable general equilibrium literature has almost exclusively studied
improvements in firms’ energy efficiency.6 The present setting also differs from Fullerton and
Ta (2019) in allowing for channels such as labor supply decisions and households’ substitution
among consumption goods.7
All of this other analytic work abstracts from the use of energy resources in the energy
supply sector. However, some computable general equilibrium modelers have emphasized the
importance of accounting for energy demand by the firms that produce the energy needed
for consumption good production (e.g., Allan et al., 2007; Sorrell, 2007; Hanley et al., 2009;
Turner, 2009).8 I show that the energy supply sector is critical to the possibility of super5

There are quite a few numerical studies with computable general equilibrium models (see Sorrell, 2007;
Allan et al., 2009; Turner, 2013; Broberg et al., 2015), which often report quite large effects from general
equilibrium channels. There is also a large partial equilibrium literature. See Greening et al. (2000), Sorrell
and Dimitropoulos (2008), Sorrell et al. (2009), and van den Bergh (2011). Neoclassical growth settings have
emphasized how analogues of partial equilibrium income and substitution effects arise after improving the
productivity of energy in the broader economy’s production function (Saunders, 1992, 2000). Finally, Hart
(2018) and Rausch and Schwerin (2019) study the role of rebound in explaining the long-run dynamics of
aggregate energy use, emphasizing expanding varieties of energy-using goods and putty-clay production of
energy-using capital, respectively.
6
In 2018, the residential and transportation sectors accounted for 21% and 28% of U.S. energy consumption, respectively, with light-duty vehicles constituting 55% of transportation sector energy use. See
https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/use-of-energy/.
7
Fullerton and Ta (2019) emphasize the fixed costs that households must bear when purchasing more
efficient appliances. I instead introduce costly efficiency improvements in the way that computable general
equilibrium models have introduced them, as reductions in the productivity of other factors (see Allan et al.,
2007, 2009; Broberg et al., 2015).
8
In their reviews, Greening et al. (2000) emphasize the potential for large adjustments in energy supply
and Turner (2013) laments the lack of attention given to energy supply in analyses of rebound effects. Based
on numerical experiments, Saunders (2014) conjectures that greater efficiency in energy production will
inevitably backfire. I formally demonstrate that backfire is indeed especially likely in this case, but I also

conservation and that improvements to the efficiency of energy supply are much more likely
to backfire than are improvements to the efficiency of consumption good production. Quantitatively, I find that energy supply sector responses are the most important of the general
equilibrium channels and even change the sign of the overall effect of general equilibrium
considerations. Abstracting from these responses is not innocuous.
The next section describes the setting. Section 3 derives the equilibrium prices and
allocation. Section 4 recounts the familiar partial equilibrium analysis. Section 5 analyzes
general equilibrium rebound from improvements in the energy efficiency of consumption
good producers and energy producers. It also quantitatively explores the effects of greater
efficiency in the U.S. economy. Section 6 extends the setting to allow for directed technical
change and analyzes whether profit-driven research firms target sectors in which improved
efficiency will backfire. Section 7 considers improvements in efficiency that impose costs
on firms. The final section concludes. The appendix reports additional numerical results;
connects the analysis to income effects of interest when energy services are direct inputs
to households’ utility; and extends the main analysis to consider the implications for total
energy use of improvements in labor productivity, total factor productivity, and economywide energy efficiency.

Each consumption good is produced competitively using quantity Ri of energy resources

We will see in Section 5.3 that standard calibrations use  < 1 when the consumption good sectors
represent different types of goods and services.  > 1 would be more likely if the sectors instead represented
different varieties of a single product.

The production function has a constant elasticity of substitution σi > 0, with σi 6= 1. I will

of energy resources and of labor are determined by Ai > 0 and Bi > 0, respectively. We can
interpret Ai Ri as energy services such as heating, lighting, or mechanical motion, with Ai
controlling the conversion from Ri into energy services.
The same energy resources are used in each sector. In equilibrium, each sector pays price

I study market equilibria.
Definition 1. An equilibrium is given by consumption good prices ({pi }N

labor (w), a price for energy resources (pR ), demands for inputs ({Li , Ri }N

for consumption goods ({ci }N

profits of producers of consumption good i for i ∈ {1, ..., N }, (ii) (LN +1 , RN +1 ) maximizes

I interpret the household factor endowment as labor, but it can also be interpreted as a capital endowment. The household is then choosing how much capital to use in household production and how much to
rent to industrial sectors. We will see that the household’s supply becomes fixed as Θ → 1, which corresponds
to a short-run capital allocation problem. And we will see that the household’s supply becomes perfectly
elastic as Θ → ∞, which corresponds to a small economy open to world capital markets.

Labor supplied increases in the wage if and only if Θ > 1. A substitution effect drives
workers to offer more labor when the wage increases but an income effect drives workers to
offer less labor when the wage increases. The substitution effect dominates when Θ > 1, and
the income effect dominates when Θ < 1. The two effects exactly offset each other when
Θ = 1, making this case equivalent to the case of fixed labor supply that has been one focal
point in computable general equilibrium models of rebound effects (e.g., Allan et al., 2006,
2007; Broberg et al., 2015). As Θ → ∞, labor supply becomes perfectly elastic, a case that
has been a second focal point in the same models.

General Equilibrium Rebound

Partial Equilibrium Rebound

I begin by reviewing partial equilibrium rebound from a 1% improvement in the efficiency
of energy service production in some sector k ∈ {1, ..., N + 1}.
First, the simplest “engineering” calculation does not consider changes in prices and does
not allow for factor substitution by firms: it fixes ck , Bk Lk , and Ak Rk . Let Ek be the energy
services used prior to the improvement in Ak : Ek , Ak Rk . Totally differentiate and set
dEk = 0 to hold energy services fixed: 0 = Rk dAk + Ak dRk . The energy resource savings
from a 1% improvement in Ak become:
Savingseng , −Ak

dRk
= Rk .
dAk

The engineering calculation predicts that a 1% improvement in the efficiency of energy
conversion leads to a 1% reduction in energy resource use.
Economists have long noted that improving the efficiency of energy conversion lowers the
relative price of energy resources, which leads profit- or utility-maximizing agents to increase
their use of energy resources. This substitution towards energy resource inputs is called
rebound and is often analyzed in a partial equilibrium setting in which the prices of energy
resources, of non-energy inputs, and of consumption goods are held fixed.13 Equation (10)
gives resource demand Rk (Ak , pk , pR , w, L) as a function of technology, prices, and labor
supplied. The partial equilibrium calculation does not allow pk , pR , w, or L to change with
Ak , so that
SavingsP E , − Ak

∂Rk (Ak , pk , pR , w, L)
= (1 − σk )Rk .
∂Ak

Partial equilibrium rebound, as a fraction of the no-rebound or “engineering” savings from
an improvement in energy efficiency, is then
Rebound

(17)

Partial equilibrium rebound is equal to σk , a result familiar from much previous work (e.g.,
Saunders, 1992; Sorrell and Dimitropoulos, 2008). This analysis suggests that a 1% improvement in energy efficiency most strongly reduces energy resource use when it occurs
in a sector with high energy resource use (large Rk ) and a small elasticity of substitution
between energy and non-energy inputs (small σk ). Partial equilibrium rebound goes to zero
as σk → 0, in which case the firm has a Leontief production function and so has no scope to
adjust its input mix.
13

In some settings, energy services are modeled as a direct input to utility. The appendix derives a partial
equilibrium direct income effect that depends on the budget share of energy resources.

Figure 1 graphically describes the partial equilibrium effect. It plots the combinations
of Rk and Lk that generate a given quantity of output ck , and it also plots the isocost line
(dashed). Prior to the improvement in energy efficiency, the firm’s profit-maximizing point is
at point A, where the solid isoquant is tangent to the isocost line. Improving the efficiency of
energy conversion technology changes the isoquant to the dotted line. The improvement in
efficiency shifts the frontier by more in regions of heavy energy resource use. The engineering
calculation of the change in energy resource use holds Lk fixed, so it finds the point B on
the altered isoquant that is directly below point A. Point B is on a lower isocost line. The
vertical distance between points A and B defines the energy resource savings. The partial
equilibrium calculation recognizes that the firm will reoptimize its input mix to return to
a point of tangency with the isocost line. As σk → 0 (left), point B is also the point of
tangency with the altered isoquant. For larger σk (right), the new point of tangency (labeled
C) is to the left and above point B. The vertical distance between points B and C determines
partial equilibrium rebound. As σk becomes larger, the isoquant becomes flatter and the
vertical distance between points B and C grows. For σk > 1 (not pictured), point C is above
point A, in which case rebound is greater than 100% (a case of “backfire”). The general
equilibrium analysis will account for movement to a different isocost line and will account
for changes in factor prices that rotate the isocost line.

General Equilibrium Rebound

The previous, partial equilibrium analysis held factor and output prices fixed and asked
how energy resource use changed in the sector with improved energy efficiency. However,
pollution and other externalities are often related to the total change in energy resource use,
including changes in other sectors induced by changes in factor and output prices.14 I now
consider this total, general equilibrium change in energy resource use from an improvement
in some Ak . The appendix considers the general equilibrium consequences of an improvement
in some Bk and of an improvement in sector k’s total factor productivity.
P +1
Market-clearing in the energy supply sector required that R = N
i=1 Ri . Equation (10)
gives Ri as a function of Ai , pi , pR , w, and L for i ∈ {1, ..., N }, and equation (8) gives RN +1
as a function of R and AN +1 . Equation (5) gives pi as a function of Bi , Ai , pR , and w for
i ∈ {1, ..., N }. Equation (6) gives pR as a function of BN +1 , AN +1 , and w. Equation (2)
gives w as a function of L. And equation (16) implicitly defines L as a function of each Ai , of
each Bi , and of R. Now let variable yk indicate some Ak or some Bk , for k ∈ {1, ..., N + 1}.
14

Many authors have observed that changes in energy use do not map into changes in welfare: rebound
effects are not necessarily bad from a welfare perspective. However, those same authors nonetheless often
focus on changes in energy use because that question has been of interest to historians, to policymakers, and
to environmental economists concerned with externalities.

The second and third lines determine the sign of θR,yk . I analyze them below. The first line
contains two general equilibrium multipliers. The first multiplier is an energy supply amplifier that reflects how changes in consumer good sectors’ use of energy resources affect the
energy supply sector’s demand for energy resources. This multiplier is large when the energy
supply sector itself uses a larger share of available resources. It increases the magnitude of
θR,yk because expansions and contractions of the energy supply sector amplify changes in
energy resource demand from other sectors.16 If energy resources were not consumed in the

energy supply sector (RN +1 = 0), then the energy supply amplifier would reduce to unity.
The second multiplier is an energy supply dampener. It is driven by the terms with θL,R ,
reflecting that any change in the size of the energy supply sector changes aggregate demand
for labor. Standard calibrations assume either that labor supply is fixed (Θ = 1) or that
labor supplied increases in the wage (Θ > 1) with consumption goods complementary to each
other ( < 1). In these cases, this second multiplier unambiguously shrinks the magnitude
of θR,yk , which is why I label it a “dampener”. If energy resources were produced without
labor (LN +1 = 0), then the energy supply dampener would reduce to unity.
Substituting the elasticities that do not depend on the choice of yk , we find:

Input cost effect

The five terms in curly braces determine total rebound. The first two terms scale with
sector k’s share of total energy resource use. The first term captures the partial equilibrium
channels: it reflects how an improvement in some sector’s technology yk affects that sector’s
factor use at constant prices. The second term captures how changes in energy conversion
technology affect factor demand via output prices. Improving technology in some sector k
reduces the cost of producing that sector’s consumption good and thus reduces the price of its
consumption good (θpi ,yk ≤ 0). As a result, households substitute towards that consumption
good. This substitution increases demand for energy resource and labor inputs in sector k.
However, the lower output price also reduces demand for inputs in sector k. The net effect on
sector k’s demand for energy resources depends on (i) households’ elasticity of substitution
across consumption goods () and (ii) sector k firms’ elasticity of substitution across inputs
(σk ): from equation (10), −θRk ,pk =  − σk for k ∈ {1, ..., N }. This general equilibrium
channel increases total energy use if and only if (i) is larger than (ii), which is a common
case in numerical models and will be true of most sectors in the quantitative application
below.17
17

Jevons’ original story (see footnote 2) described this output price effect. θpk ,yk derives from the zero-profit
condition (5): the fact that θpk ,yk is negative reflects that an increase in yk produces positive profits (“the
profits of the trade will increase”) that increase entry (“new capital will be attracted”), which eventually

The previous channel vanishes if the improvement in technology occurs in the energy
supply sector N + 1, for there is no consumer good price pk . Instead, the output price is
pR . As a result, improvements in the technology used to produce energy resources generate
the third term instead of the second term. These improvements reduce the cost of energy
resources to consumption good producers (θpR ,yk ≤ 0). The reduction in the cost of energy
resources directly works to increase their use (−θRi ,pR = σi for i ∈ {1, ..., N }), and by
reducing the output price (−θpi ,pR < 0), the reduction in the cost of energy resources also
indirectly increases their use if and only if  > σi .
The first term on the final line arises only when labor supply is endogenous. θL,yk reflects
how the change in yk affects demand for labor in each sector. From equation (1), any resulting
increase in labor supplied increases demand for each consumption good by increasing total
income, and from equation (4), increased demand for a consumption good increases demand
for the resources used to produce that consumption good. Because these two relationships
are each linear conditional on prices, we have θRi ,L = 1 (see equation (10)). Therefore, this
labor supply channel works to increase total energy resource use if and only if increasing yk
increases aggregate demand for labor (θL,yk > 0).18
The remaining terms on the final line capture wage effects. A first term is an income effect:
a 1% increase in the wage increases demand for energy resources by 1% because preferences
are homothetic (θRi ,w = 1, see equation (10)). A second term reflects how a higher wage
reduces demand for energy resources by raising the cost of producing each consumption good
i, both directly and by raising the cost of producing its energy resource inputs. On net, the
income effect dominates the input cost effect if and only if  < 1, in which case a higher
wage increases energy resource use (see equation (14)). A change in sector k’s technology
increases the wage if θw,L θL,yk > 0 and reduces the wage otherwise.19

Following Saunders (2008), I say that “backfire” occurs when θR,Ak > 0 and that “superconservation” occurs when SavingsGE > Savingseng .
restores the zero-profit condition by reducing the output price (“the price of pig-iron will fall”). The reduction
in pk increases demand for ck (“but the demand for it [pig-iron] increase”) and, if  > σk , for Rk . If this
were the only effect of increasing yk , then we would have backfire (θR,yk > 0) if −( − σk )θpk ,yk > 1, in which
case “the greater number of furnaces will more than make up for the diminished consumption of each”. The
analysis below will show that this condition is equivalent to ( − σk )αRk > 1. Jevons’ story therefore requires
a value of  that is much larger than used in recent economic models.
18
If labor supply were fixed exogenously, then aggregate demand for labor would affect demand for each
consumption good in equation (1) only through the wage effect described next.
19
The wage effect does not vanish if labor supply is exogenous: θL,yk reflects changes in aggregate demand
for labor, and the wage must adjust even if the aggregate supply of labor is fixed. The wage effect vanishes
as the supply of labor becomes perfectly elastic (i.e., as Θ → ∞).

To interpret this, apply the following reasonable restrictions: let the energy supply sector

tribute a small share of overall labor demand (let LN +1 be small relative to Θ−1
i=1 Li ),
H−L
let labor supply increase with the wage (let Θ ≥ 1), and let the consumption sectors’ goods
be complements (let  < 1). The combined labor supply and wage effects then have the
opposite sign as  − σk , opposing the output price effect. If  > σk , then sector k’s demand
for labor increases through the exact same channels described for the output price effect:
improved Ak induces household substitution towards the newly cheap consumption good k.
Under the foregoing restrictions, increasing the wage (and thus the hours of labor supplied)
would further increase demand for all consumption goods and thus for the labor needed to
make them (see equation (13)—income effects are strong when  < 1). To clear the labor
market, the wage must fall.20 By the logic of the previous section, this change in the labor
market reduces demand for energy resources, thereby opposing the output price effect. The
output price effect dominates when sector k constitutes a large share of energy resource use
but only a small share of the labor market. In this case, the net effect of the non-multiplier
general equilibrium channels is to increase energy resource use if and only if  > σk .

We will see immediately below that allowing LN +1 be large relative to Θ−1
i=1 Li (e.g., because

of large Θ) changes this logic, because now a higher wage can induce households to supply sufficiently more
labor to satisfy the additional demand for labor.

Two special cases are of interest because of their prominence in computable general
equilibrium models. First, if labor supply is fixed exogenously (i.e., if Θ = 1), then the sum

which works to reduce energy use in the common case that  > σk . The labor market can
adjust only through changes in the wage, and we just saw that increasing demand for labor
in sector k must reduce that wage in order to bring demand back down to match the fixed
supply. Second, if labor supply is perfectly elastic (i.e., as Θ → ∞), then the sum of the
labor supply and wage effects is22
PN

which works to increase energy resource use in the common case that  > σk . Now the wage
is fixed. As improving Ak increases demand for labor in sector k (assuming  > σk ), the
labor market clears with more hours of labor. The additional hours worked increase demand
for energy resources. Consistent with this analysis, computable general equilibrium models
report greater rebound when modeling perfectly elastic labor supply as opposed to a fixed
labor supply (Allan et al., 2007, 2009; Broberg et al., 2015).
The following proposition considers a case in which each consumption good sector has
the same production function.
Proposition 1. Assume that Θ = 1 and either N = 1 or κi , σi , Bi , and Ai do not vary
with i for i ∈ {1, ..., N }. Consider an improvement in Ak for some k ∈ {1, ..., N }.
1. The only general equilibrium channels are the multipliers, leaving θR,Ak =

2. Backfire occurs if and only if σ > 1.
3. If RN +1 /LN +1 > Rk /Lk , then there exists σ̂ ∈ (0, 1) such that super-conservation
occurs if and only if σ < σ̂. If RN +1 /LN +1 < Rk /Lk , then super-conservation does not
occur for any σ > 0.
Proof.

Θ = 1, and using i=1 Li = N Lk and i=1 Ri = N Rk yields the first part of the proposition.
21

This expression also holds as  → ∞, for Θ 6= 1. In this case of highly substitutable consumption goods,
the labor market effects are driven by the input cost effect, irrespective of the the labor supply effect.
22
This expression also holds as  → 1, for Θ 6= 1. In this case, the income and input cost effects cancel,
leaving only the labor supply effect.

The second part of the proposition follows from that result and the definition of backfire as
occurring if and only if θR,Ak > 0. To establish the third part of the proposition, note that

The result follows straightforwardly from this expression, the assumption that σ > 0, and the
fact that, under the conditions of the proposition, Lk /L < Rk /R if and only if RN +1 /LN +1 <
Rk /Lk .
If N = 1, then there is no scope for substitution when input costs change, and even if N > 1,
substitution does not affect energy resource use if consumption good sectors are symmetric.
In either case, the terms in braces in equation (19) reduce to only the partial equilibrium
effect if labor supply is fixed (Θ = 1). Backfire arises if and only if σ > 1, as in Section 4.
However, even though only the partial equilibrium effect remains from the terms in braces,
θR,Ak is not identical to the pure partial equilibrium result, which would be (σ − 1)Rk /R.
The difference arises because the general equilibrium analysis accounts for effects on energy
supply, generating the multipliers in equation (18). Whereas the partial equilibrium analysis
of changes in Rk in Section 4 showed that super-conservation was impossible, we now find
that super-conservation is possible if σ is small and energy production is especially energyintensive. When σ is small, the partial equilibrium effect on sector k reduces sector k’s
demand for resources. That reduction in resource demand leads the energy supply sector to
contract, which in turn reduces demand for energy resources in that sector. This multiplier
effect amplifies the energy resource savings from any given reduction in energy resource
demand in the consumption good sectors. When σ is sufficiently small, the total energy
resource savings can be greater even than predicted by an engineering calculation.23
Now
PNimagine that consumption good sectors differ only in their energy efficiency A. Let
Ā , i=1 Ai /N indicate the average A across the consumption good sectors.
Proposition 2. Assume that Θ = 1, that κi , σi , and Bi do not vary with i for i ∈ {1, ..., N },
and that V ar(A) is small relative to Ā. Consider an improvement in Ak for some k ∈
{1, ..., N }.
1. If σ < 1 and either σ ≤  < 1 or (Ak − Ā)( − 1) > 0, then θR,Ak < 0.
2. If σ > 1 and either σ ≥  > 1 or (Ak − Ā)( − 1) > 0, then θR,Ak > 0.
23

This analysis clarifies the conditions under which the changes in energy suppliers’ demand for energy
inputs considered in Turner (2009, 664) can lead to super-conservation. Of course, this multiplier effect
works the other way as well, as it also amplifies backfire. Turner (2009) also discusses disinvestment effects,
which can arise only in a dynamic model with imperfectly adjustable capital stocks, and Borenstein (2015)
discusses other sources of negative rebound in a partial equilibrium setting of household energy use.

The proposition identifies sufficient conditions under which greater efficiency either avoids
or generates backfire. Improved efficiency is likely to reduce energy resource use when σ is
small and to backfire when σ is large. The partial equilibrium effect is strong for values of
σ far from 1, and is strong enough to dominate any conflicting general equilibrium effects
if  is between σ and 1. However, matters are more complicated when σ is closer to 1
than is . We can clearly sign the effects when (Ak − Ā)( − 1) > 0 because the general
equilibrium effects then reinforce the partial equilibrium effect. The relationship between σ
and 1 controls whether sectors with higher-than-average Ak are especially energy-intensive,
the relation between  and 1 controls whether households substitute towards or away from
the sector with improved efficiency, and the relationship between σ and  determines how
changes in consumption good prices affect factor demand. As an example, consider the case
with Ak > Ā and σ ∈ (1, ). Households substitute towards sector k, which has aboveaverage efficiency. When σ ∈ (1, ), sector k’s factor demand increases as its output price
falls. The output price falls when the effect of improved Ak outweighs the effect of a higher
wage, which occurs when sector k is especially energy-intensive (as implied by Ak > Ā).
In this case, the general equilibrium channels reinforce the partial equilibrium channel and
backfire is unambiguous. If, instead, Ak < Ā then the general equilibrium channels reduce
energy resource use and the net effect of improved efficiency is ambiguous.
Now letP
consumption good sectors differ only in their efficiency B of non-energy inputs,

Two limiting cases are of special interest: one in which sector k does not use any energy
resources (κk → 1), and one in which sector k uses only energy resources (κk → 0). The
latter case is closely related to settings in which households use energy resources directly.
Proposition 4. Consider an improvement in Ak for some k ∈ {1, ..., N }.
1. θR,Ak → 0 as κk → 1.
2. Assume Θ = 1 and let κk → 0. If N = 1, then θR,Ak → 0; if N > 1, then θR,Ak > 0 if
and only if  > 1.
Proof. From equation (14), Rk → 0 as κk → 1. We also then have αRk → 0 as κk → 1. The
first result follows.

then i=1 Li = 0, but if N > 1, then i=1 Li > 0. The second result follows.
If sector k does not use any energy resources (because κk is large), then an improvement in
Ak is of limited importance and we have no change in use of energy resources. If, instead,
sector k is highly energy-intensive (because κk is small), then the wage and labor supply
effects become small because sector k does not use much labor. Further, the output price pk
declines by an especially large amount because the value share of energy resources goes to 1.
The resulting reduction in producers’ demand for Rk exactly offsets their partial equilibrium
substitution towards Rk . We are left with the engineering savings, the effect of household
substitution towards consumption good k, and the energy supply multipliers. If N > 1
and  > 1, then the effect of household substitution dominates the engineering savings,
generating backfire. If N > 1 and  < 1, then the engineering savings dominate. If N = 1,
then households must spend all of their income on the lone consumption good. In that case,
a competitive sector expands its use of resources to the point where it fully destroys the
profits generated by the engineering savings and we have no net change in energy resource
use due to the improved technology.

The partial equilibrium effect is the same as in Section 5.1. However, the general equilibrium
effects are quite different. First, we now have a resource supply effect arising because the
improvement in efficiency reduces the price of energy resources. This price reduction increases
use of energy resources because consumption good producers substitute towards the newly
cheap energy resources (controlled by σi ). In addition, this price reduction leads the price of
each consumption good to fall (with implications determined by  − σi , as described earlier).
The resource supply effect unambiguously increases energy resource use if  > σi for all
i ∈ {1, ..., N }.
Second, the labor supply and wage effects now each have two components. A first term
(σN +1 LN +1 ) captures how improving AN +1 reduces pR (see equation (6)) and thereby reduces demand for labor in the energy supply sector (controlled by σN +1 ). A second term
captures how improving energy supply technology makes energy resources more abundant
in all consumption good sectors, with effects on all consumption good sectors’ output prices
and demand for labor as described in the previous section. The first term opposes the second
when  > σi for each i ∈ {1, ..., N }.
These new general equilibrium effects can be large even when the value share of energy
resources is small, as it often is in the U.S. economy. In contrast, the non-multiplier general
equilibrium channels analyzed in Section 5.1 all scale with the value share of energy resources.
In practice, we should therefore expect general equilibrium effects to be especially important
when energy efficiency improvements arise in the energy supply sector.
The following propositions analyze especially tractable special cases:

Proposition 5. Assume that Θ = 1 and either N = 1 or κi , σi , Bi , and Ai do not vary
with i for i ∈ {1, ..., N }. Consider an improvement in AN +1 .
1. The non-multiplier general equilibrium channels are strictly positive.
2. There exists σ̂ ∈ (0, 1) such that backfire occurs if σ + σN +1 > σ̂.
3. If RN +1 /LN +1 > Ri /Li for i ∈ {1, ..., N }, then super-conservation can occur only if
σ + σN +1 < 1. If RN +1 /LN +1 < Ri /Li for i ∈ {1, ..., N }, then super-conservation does
not occur for any σ, σN +1 > 0.
Proof.
PNIf either N =
PN1 or each consumption good sector has identical parameters, then
Rj / i=1 Ri = Lj / i=1 Li = 1/N for all j ∈ {1, ..., N }. Label the σi simply σ. Using

Proposition 6. Assume that either Θ = 1 or LN +1 /L is small and that, for i ∈ {1, ..., N },
each σi ≈ 1 and κi does not vary with i. Consider an improvement in AN +1 .
1. The general equilibrium channels are strictly positive.

when σi ≈ 1 and is then independent of i when, in addition,P
κi is independent of i. From

otherwise. The denominator is strictly positive if Θ > 1 and the numerator is strictly positive

The second part of the proposition follows.
In contrast to Proposition 1, the non-multiplier general equilibrium channels in Proposition 5 are strictly positive even when N = 1 and even when consumption good sectors are
symmetric. The reason is that general equilibrium channels now account for the effect of an
outward shift in energy supply on every consumption good producer’s input cost. As the
cost of energy resources falls, consumption good firms substitute towards newly cheap energy
resources. The sufficient condition for backfire becomes less demanding than in Proposition 1
and the necessary condition for super-conservation becomes even more demanding than in
Proposition 1. As before, backfire occurs when the partial equilibrium effect favors backfire,
but now backfire can also occur when the partial equilibrium effect is as negative as can
be (i.e., even as σN +1 → 0). And Proposition 6 shows that backfire can now occur even
when consumption good production is Cobb-Douglas. This result formalizes and confirms
the results of numerical models that have emphasized rebound from the energy supply sector
(see Allan et al., 2007; Sorrell, 2007; Hanley et al., 2009; Turner, 2009).

5.3

Evaluating the magnitude of general equilibrium rebound

The primary tools for evaluating general equilibrium rebound are computable general equilibrium models, which can be black boxes, can be difficult to calibrate convincingly, and are
often not accessible to the broader research community. On the other hand, reduced-form,
program evaluation methods have been restricted to evaluating partial equilibrium rebound
in particular applications. I here develop a third approach, using the theoretical results in
equations (19) and (22) to estimate the general equilibrium implications of improved energy
efficiency. This approach is more structural than reduced-form methods in that the key
equations derive from a fully specified economic model, but it is less structural than computable general equilibrium models in that it does not require knowledge of all structural
parameters in order to calculate the effects of interest. This new approach is in the spirit of
recommendations in Heckman (2010), of sufficient statistics methods as described in Chetty
(2009), and of price theory as described in Weyl (2019).
Rather than detailed knowledge of sectoral production functions, equations (19) and (22)
only require knowledge of sectoral input use and the several elasticities of substitution. I

Economic Analysis data on the composition of U.S. output by industry.24 I approximate each
industry’s share of total energy resource and labor use by its share of total spending on energy
and labor. I aggregate the various mining sectors, the utility sector, the petroleum and coal
products sector, and the pipeline transportation sector into a single energy supply sector. I
calibrate each sector’s σk to estimates from Koesler and Schymura (2015) and Marten and
Garbaccio (2018).25 I follow Herrendorf et al. (2013). Atalay (2017), and Baqaee and Farhi
(2019) in setting  = 0.9.26 Finally, I here fix Θ = 1, which is equivalent to a short-run
analysis that holds labor supply fixed. The appendix shows that calibrating Θ does not
appreciably change the results.
The left panel of Figure 2 plots the calculated θR,Ak for all consumption good sectors
against their estimated σk , with the markers scaled by Rk /R. Some computable general
equilibrium analyses of rebound have set σk = 0.3 in all sectors (e.g., Allan et al., 2007;
Hanley et al., 2009; Turner, 2009), but we here see substantial variation across sectors.
Sectors with a small elasticity of substitution between energy resources and labor tend to
show larger reductions in energy resource use, and for a given elasticity of substitution,
sectors with a larger share of total energy resource use also tend to show larger effects. Both
of these results follow directly from the partial equilibrium channel. Only five sectors show
backfire, and these five are the only sectors with σk greater than 1.27 Further, backfire is
extremely slight in four of these five sectors, reflecting that their estimated σk is fairly close
to 1. The right panel of Figure 2 includes 95% confidence intervals based on standard errors
for σk reported in Koesler and Schymura (2015).28 Several additional transportation sectors
(i.e., truck, rail, and transit) now plausibly backfire, but efficiency improvements still clearly
reduce total energy resource use in nearly all of the plotted sectors.
Table 1 decomposes the percentage change in economy-wide resource use resulting from
a 1% improvement in a given sector’s efficiency. The top panel reports the energy supply
multipliers. The combined multiplier is greater than 1, indicating that expansion and contraction of the energy supply sector amplifies changes in other sectors’ energy resource use.
The lower panel decomposes θR,Ak for the sectors with the greatest reductions in resource
use and for combinations of sectors.29 Consider the non-energy supply sectors. The partial

single sector. NAICS codes 531 (discussed below) and 541 are divided into multiple sectors.
25
I calibrate a single σN +1 for the energy supply sector by taking an average of the underlying sectors’
values, weighted by gross output. The underlying sectors’ values are rather similar to each other.

The value of  used in computable general equilibrium models of rebound is not always reported, but it
does appear that the analogous parameter in Broberg et al. (2015) is set to 0.9 (parameter “sovr” reported

equilibrium effects are negative for all of these sectors, with many of them having quite small
values of σk . The output price effect works to increase energy resource use but the wage
effect works to reduce energy resource use. The output price usually dominates the wage
effect in these sectors, so that the non-multiplier general equilibrium channels usually work
to increase energy resource use on net.30 However, this net effect is usually small relative
to the partial equilibrium effect, in part because the value share of energy resources tends
to be small. As a result, the most important general equilibrium channels are the energy
supply multipliers. The total reduction in energy resource use is therefore even greater than
suggested by partial equilibrium estimates despite the non-multiplier general equilibrium
channels working to increase energy resource use.
Simultaneously improving energy efficiency in all non-energy supply sectors reduces energy resource use by 0.58%, with rebound of 28%.31 The greatest total reduction in energy

The appendix shows that the non-multiplier general equilibrium channels do work to reduce energy
resource use on net for sectors that provide smaller energy savings. In sectors that backfire, the output price
effect works to reduce energy resource use and the wage effect works to increase energy resource use. These
changes occur because σk >  in the sectors that backfire. The sectors with greater backfire see the output
price effect dominate, but the sectors with less backfire see the wage effect dominate.
31
This experiment matches a benchmark experiment undertaken by computable general equilibrium modelers in recent studies of European economies. They report rebound on the order of 30–70% (e.g., Allan
et al., 2006, 2007; Turner, 2009; Broberg et al., 2015). There are many differences in model structure and
calibration that could explain the higher values.

resource use comes from the “Other real estate” sector, which includes all components of
NAICS code 531 (“Real estate”) that are not categorized as housing. This sector has by
far the largest share of total energy resource use among the non-energy supply sectors (over
twice that of any other). This large share of total energy resource use overcomes its σk
not being terribly small.32 Even here, however, rebound reduces energy resource savings by
64% relative to an engineering calculation. Several of the next most promising sectors (such
as construction and truck transportation) also use energy resources at a substantial scale.
This scale makes the conservation benefits of efficiency especially large, but a full evaluation
would have to consider that obtaining a 1% improvement in efficiency may be more difficult
to achieve in sectors with a large stock of energy-using capital. Rebound is nontrivial in
most sectors, but three of these sectors (construction, hospitals, and a financial sector) do
show negative rebound, or “super-conservation”. In all of these cases, especially small σk
limits partial equilibrium rebound and the non-multiplier general equilibrium channels either
roughly cancel each other or combine to reduce energy resource use.
Consistent with the theoretical analysis, the energy supply sector shows substantial rebound. General equilibrium channels here play an important role, increasing rebound to 80%
from the 42% produced by partial equilibrium effects.33 The most important general equilibrium channel is the resource supply effect, which almost offsets the partial equilibrium effect.
The resource supply effect is so much larger than the output price effects seen in downstream
sectors because it includes terms that do not scale with the value share of resources. We
saw that general equilibrium channels enhance the energy resource savings from improving
efficiency in all non-energy supply sectors (raising them from 0.49% to 0.58%), but the final
row of Table 1 shows that rebound in the energy supply sector nearly cancels that effect
when improving efficiency throughout the economy (general equilibrium channels now raise
energy resource savings from 0.60% to only 0.62%).

This finding relates to a broader debate about the merits of energy efficiency in building codes. This
debate has primarily focused on residential housing, with some studies reporting little to no gain from greater
efficiency in that sector (Levinson, 2016). The “Housing” sector here has nearly no change in energy resource
use from greater efficiency, and in fact sees the smallest reduction of any sector that does not backfire (see
appendix). However, this sector here likely includes real estate lessors and agents rather than housing as
thought of in the literature: its small energy savings arise because its Rk /R is tiny. The “Other real estate”
sector can be interpreted as commercial real estate, for which the reduced-form literature has indeed detected
sizable reductions in energy resource use from greater efficiency (Papineau, 2017).
33
Note, however, that the energy supply sector’s standard error for σk from Koesler and Schymura (2015)
is enormous, above 10 even though the central estimate of σk is only around 0.4. It is entirely plausible that
improved efficiency would backfire in this sector, even to a rather large degree.

increase or decrease total resource use. I endogenize innovation by extending the setting
to allow for directed technical change in the fashion of Acemoglu (2002, 2007): innovations
will be driven by the market value of patents to improved technologies. I consider which
sector a marginal research firm would target, with the predetermined technology parameters
Ai reflecting both the incoming quality of technology and any pre-existing allocation of
research effort.
Modify the production function for consumption goods to include an inner nest in which
energy resources are combined with machines, which are produced according to the DixitStiglitz model of monopolistic competition. The number of machines of variety j produced
in sector i is zij , with the continuum of varieties indexed on the unit interval. Production of
sector i’s consumption good becomes:

for γ ∈ (0, 1). We recover the previous setting as γ → 0. Machine producers have a monopoly
on their variety j, sell their machines at price pij , and have marginal cost of ζ units of
energy resources. Market-clearing for energy resources now accounts for the resources used
in machine production. Each household owns a share in each machine producer. Research
firms choose which sector to target and are randomly allocated to a variety within that
sector, as in Acemoglu et al. (2012). They succeed in innovating with probability η, in which
case they improve the quality of their machine variety to (1 + ρ)Aij and receive a patent for
its production.
The appendix solves for the equilibrium. Household demand for consumption good i now
increases in resource use because household income from sector i’s machines increases in Ri .
The appendix shows that equilibrium resource use in the machine sectors is

There are only a few differences with respect to the expression in Section 5.1. Most obvious
are the leading 1 − γ (reflecting that the technology becomes irrelevant as γ approaches 1)
and the replacement of αRk with αRk + αzk (reflecting that the value share of machines is
now also critical to the effect of Ak on the price of consumption goods).34 It is easy to see
34

The other differences are the inclusion of a term in the energy supply dampener that further reduces it
when Θ > 1 and  < 1 and the inclusion of a term in the denominator of the labor supply and wage effects
that shrinks their magnitudes. Both terms derive from the new dependence of Ri on R through ci : income
from the machine sector increases in the number of machines produced and thus in total resource use, so
factor demand now increases in total resource use.

that Propositions 1 and 2 apply here.35 When consumption good sectors differ only in their
average energy efficiency and Θ = 1, additional research effort increases energy resource use
if researchers target sectors that are already relatively (in)efficient with σ > 1 and  > (<)
1, but additional research effort reduces energy resource use if researchers target sectors that
are already relatively (in)efficient with σ < 1 and  > (<) 1.

6.2

Researchers’ incentives

I now consider which sectors researchers target. A research firm’s expected profit from
targeting sector i is:
Z 1
Πi , η
πij ((1 + ρ)Aij ) dj,
0

where πij (·) gives the profits obtained by producers of machine variety j in sector i, as a
function of their machines’ efficiency (see appendix). Researchers target sector i instead of
sector j if and only if the expected relative profit Πi /Πj is at least 1. Using equations (A-9)
and (A-8), we find:
Πi R i
= .
Πj Rj
Now assume that consumption good sectors differ only in the average quality of their energy
conversion technology. Substituting from equations (A-7) and (A-11), we have:

We now have the following proposition:
Proposition 7. Assume that Θ = 1, that κi , σi , and Bi do not vary with i for i ∈ {1, ..., N },
and that V ar(A) is small relative to Ā. Without loss of generality, let Ai ≥ Ai−1 for all
i ∈ {2, ..., N }. Consider a marginal increase in the number of research firms.
35

The only difference, which is irrelevant to the analysis in this section, is that the condition for superconservation to be possible must be modified to reflect Rz .

1. If σ,  < 1, then the additional innovation occurs in sector 1 and total energy resource
use decreases.
2. If σ,  > 1, then the additional innovation occurs in sector N and total energy resource
use increases.
Proof. If equation (23) is negative (positive) for all Ai with i ∈ {1, ..., N }, then the marginal
research firm targets the sector with the smallest (largest) Ai . Equation (23) is negative
(positive) for all Ai with i ∈ {1, ..., N } if σ,  < (>) 1. Section 6.1 established that Proposition 2 still holds in this setting with monopolistically competitive machine production. The
proposition follows.
Proposition 2 described how the effect of improved efficiency can depend on whether the
sector that improves its efficiency was already more or less efficient than average, and we
saw in Section 6.1 that this proposition still applies in our extension to monopolistically
competitive machine production. We now see that profit-driven innovation directs itself
towards the least efficient sector if σ,  < 1 and directs itself towards the most efficient sector
if σ,  > 1. As a result, profit-driven innovation directs itself towards sectors that reduce
total energy resource use if σ,  < 1 and directs itself towards sectors that increase total
energy resource use if σ,  > 1.

Extension 2: Costly Improvements in Energy Efficiency

Most quantitative analyses of general equilibrium rebound consider a free improvement in
energy efficiency, as did the analysis in Section 5. Even in Section 6, machine producers’
equilibrium mark-ups end up being independent of their machines’ efficiency. I now consider improvements to energy efficiency that impose costs on firms that adopt the improved
technology, as when firms improve efficiency in order to satisfy a policy mandate.
In sensitivity analyses with computable general equilibrium models, Allan et al. (2007),
Allan et al. (2009), and Broberg et al. (2015) numerically assess the implications of improvements in energy efficiency that come at the cost of reducing the productivity of either labor or
a value-added aggregate.36 These experiments set the penalty on other factors’ productivity
to neutralize the benefits of efficiency at initial prices. I here study an improvement in efficiency that reduces the productivity of labor by δ percent: the percentage change in energy
36

There is also a long tradition of modeling pollution regulations as reducing factor productivity (e.g.,
Marten et al., 2019). The analysis of θR,Bk in the appendix is informative about the general equilibrium
consequences of regulations that reduce the productivity of non-energy factors. The foregoing analysis of
θR,Ak is informative about the general equilibrium consequences of regulations that reduce energy efficiency
in the service of pollution abatement, as with requiring scrubbers on coal-fired power plants.

resource use from a 1% increase in efficiency is no longer θR,Ak but is instead θR,Ak − δθR,Bk .37

The partial equilibrium effect and energy supply multipliers are as before. However, the
other general equilibrium effects now scale with αRk − δαLk instead of αRk . In the numerical
application in Section 5.3, αRk and αLk are of similar magnitude in a few sectors but αRk
is substantially smaller than αLk in most sectors. The general equilibrium channels will
therefore tend to switch sign if improved energy efficiency penalizes labor productivity to an
appreciable degree. For the sectors listed in Table 1, the non-multiplier general equilibrium
channels will then work to reduce energy resource use on net.
The final line in equation (24) is a new general equilibrium effect. Changes in Bk affect
Lk through the same partial equilibrium channels already described for the effect of Ak on
Rk . These changes in Lk in turn affect all sectors’ resource use by changing the wage and
labor supplied. This channel reinforces the familiar partial equilibrium effect if Θ is close to
1.
Combining these observations, we have seen that costly improvements to energy efficiency
make the familiar non-multiplier general equilibrium channels in Table 1 smaller (or even
negative) and introduce a new channel that often reinforces the negative partial equilibrium
effects in Table 1. Therefore, we can expect costly improvements in energy efficiency to
37

In a setting focused on household energy use, Fullerton and Ta (2019) consider the purchase of more
efficient appliances. They assume a particular production function for appliance efficiency.

reduce energy resource use to a greater degree than reported in Table 1. Further, superconservation may arise for sectors with small σk and/or large δαLk . These conclusions are
consistent with the numerical results in Allan et al. (2007), Allan et al. (2009), and Broberg
et al. (2015).

8

Conclusions

We have decomposed the general equilibrium consequences of improvements in energy efficiency. We have seen that these consequences are likely to be especially important when
improvements occur in sectors with a large value share of energy resources and an elasticity
of substitution among inputs that is very different from the elasticity of substitution among
consumption goods. General equilibrium consequences are also likely to be especially important when improvements occur in sectors that produce the energy resources used as inputs
to consumption good production. Quantitatively, the most important general equilibrium
consequences arise from expansions and contractions in the size of the energy supply sector
and from the effect of the energy supply sector’s technology on other sectors’ energy costs.
I have emphasized how household substitution among consumption goods, labor markets,
the energy supply sector, and innovation incentives affect the implications of improved efficiency. Other work has emphasized trade (e.g., Allan et al., 2007; Hanley et al., 2009; Turner,
2009; Broberg et al., 2015), distortions such as non-marginal cost pricing (Borenstein, 2015),
household energy use (Lecca et al., 2014; Fullerton and Ta, 2019), the introduction of new varieties of energy-using goods (Hart, 2018), the dynamics of capital allocation (Turner, 2009),
and the dynamics of capital accumulation (Wei and Liu, 2017). Future work should integrate
these and other features into the present setting and should adapt recent techniques (e.g.,
Baqaee and Farhi, 2019) to model the network structure of the economy in more detail.

Appendix
The first section derives direct income effects discussed in previous literature by connecting
the analysis to a case in which households purchase energy resources directly. The second
section analyzes the implications for total energy resource use of improvements in the energy
efficiency of every sector, in the productivity of labor, and in total factor productivity. The
third section solves for equilibrium in the setting with endogenous innovation. The fourth
section reports additional estimates of rebound in the U.S. economy.

A

Direct income effects

I here provide a partial equilibrium analysis of a representative setting in which energy
services are a direct input to utility (e.g., Lecca et al., 2014; Borenstein, 2015; Chan and
Gillingham, 2015), as with gasoline purchases or household appliances. Define an additional
consumption good as A0 R0 , where R0 is energy resources purchased by the household and A0
is the household’s efficiency of energy conversion. There are still N standard consumption
goods, produced in quantity ci for i ∈ {1, ..., N }. Hold the hours of labor supply fixed,
normalized to 1. The representative household’s utility is now:

u(R0 , C) = ν(A0 R0 )
for χ > 0, 6= 1. The price of energy resources is still pR and the price of each consumption
good is still pi .
The representative household solves the following maximization problem:

Now consider how household resource use responds to an improvement in A0 , holding pR ,
each pi , and, at first, C fixed. Differentiating equation (A-1), we have:
θR0 ,A0 = χ − 1.
This is the standard partial equilibrium result that resource use increases if and only if
resources and other inputs are substitutes. However, by holding the consumption index C
fixed, this expression does not respect the budget constraint. In fact, altering purchases of R0
allows the household to alter purchases of C, even before accounting for general equilibrium
changes in prices and wages. In order to see what has been called the “direct income effect”
of improved A0 , instead differentiate equation (A-2) to obtain:
θR0 ,A0 = (χ − 1)(1 − αR0 ),
where the budget share of resources is

The new term −(χ − 1)αR0 is a direct income effect. Whether households end up using more
(χ > 1) or less (χ < 1) R0 , the magnitude of any changes is limited by the household’s
desire to rebalance expenditures. Further, altered purchases of other consumption goods
affect demand for their resource inputs in ways analyzed in the main text. These effects are
typically described as indirect income effects. They do not arise in θR0 ,A0 but would appear
in a derivation of θR,A0 .
Let Υ represent the price elasticity of demand for R0 . Following Lecca et al. (2014), we
have:
Υ = χ − (χ − 1)αR0 .
See also Gørtz (1977). Substituting, we find
θR0 ,A0 = Υ − 1.
We have backfire if household demand for R0 is elastic and have energy resource savings if
household demand for R0 is inelastic.

This is nearly identical to θR,Ak , but for two differences. First, we now have αLk in place of
αRk , reflecting that the response of output prices to Bk depends on the value share of L rather
than the value share of R. Second, we now have 1 − σk appearing in the labor supply and
wage effects in place of σk − 1 appearing in the partial equilibrium effect. The improvement
in Bk does indeed affect Lk through partial equilibrium channels that are proportional to
σk − 1, as was true for the response of Rk to Ak . However, that partial equilibrium effect
maps into energy resource use only through general equilibrium channels. An increase in Lk
on net reduces energy resource use if Θ = 1, as the wage effect dominates the labor supply

effect. Finally, note that θR,Bk → θR,Ak as κ → 0.5 and σk → 1, reflecting that the two types
of factor-augmenting technical change are equivalent in a Cobb-Douglas specification.
The following proposition is the analogue of Proposition 1:
Proposition 9. Assume that Θ = 1 and either N = 1 or κi , σi , Bi , and Ai do not vary
with i for i ∈ {1, ..., N }. Consider an improvement in Bk for some k ∈ {1, ..., N }. Then
θR,Bk > 0 if and only if σ < 1.
Proof.

PNIf either N P
Rj / i=1 Ri = Lj / N
i=1 Li = 1/N for all j ∈ {1, ..., N }. The proposition follows.
The condition for backfire is now reversed from the case of an improvement in Ak . The
usual partial equilibrium analysis suggests that demand for Lk increases if and only if σ > 1.
When the supply of labor is fixed (Θ = 1), increasing demand for Lk reduces energy resource
use through the wage effect, as described in the main text. Because σ < 1 may be the
more common case empirically, we may be especially concerned about the potential for
backfire when improving the productivity of the non-energy input. This result formalizes
some previous conjectures (e.g., Saunders, 1992; Sorrell, 2007; Saunders, 2013).
We now have the analogues of Proposition 2, Corollary 3, and Proposition 12:
Proposition 10. Assume that Θ = 1, that κi , σi , and Bi do not vary with i for i ∈
{1, ..., N }, and that V ar(A) is small relative to Ā. Consider an improvement in Bk for some
k ∈ {1, ..., N }.
1. If σ < 1 and either σ ≤  < 1 or (Ak − Ā)(σ − ) > 0, then θR,Bk > 0.
2. If σ > 1 and either σ ≥  > 1 or (Ak − Ā)(σ − ) > 0, then θR,Bk < 0.

Proof. Follows from the proofs of Corollary 3 and Proposition 10.
Proposition 12. Consider an improvement in Bk for some k ∈ {1, ..., N }.
1. θR,Bk → 0 as κk → 0.
2. If Θ = 1 and κk → 1, then θR,Bk > 0 if and only if  < 1.
Proof. From equation (13), Lk → 0 as κk → 0. We also then have αLk → 0 as κk → 0. The
first result follows.
From equation (14), Rk → 0 as κk → 1. We also then have αLk → 1 as κk → 1. Then
1 − σk − ( − σk )αLk = −( − 1). The second result follows from noting that the general
equilibrium multiplier is positive for Θ = 1 and that the labor supply effect vanishes for
Θ = 1.
The logic is as in the main text, noting that an increase in Lk corresponds to a decrease in
Rk when wage effects dominate labor supply effects.

General Equilibrium Rebound

The primary difference with respect to the analysis of Section 5.2 is that now there are no
partial equilibrium effects. Instead, the partial equilibrium change in L affects R through
the wage and labor supply effects. Partial equilibrium substitution towards L in energy
production is offset by the decline in the price of the energy output, so that we are left with
the “engineering” savings in LN +1 increasing energy resource use through the wage effect
(if Θ = 1). As a result, backfire must arise when the output price channels in the resource
supply and wage effects offset each other (whether because N = Θ = 1 or because sectors
are symmetric with Θ = 1). That backfire is driven both by the adjustment in the wage and
also by consumption good producers’ substitution towards newly cheap energy resources. In
fact, not only does backfire occur, but a 1% improvement in LN +1 can increase total energy
resource use by more than 1%. Finally, if consumption good sectors are Cobb-Douglas with
similar factor shares, then energy resource use increases by the same percentage that BN +1
improved.

κi when σi ≈ 1 and is then independent of i when, in addition, κi is independent of i.

Additional numerical results

D.1

Allowing Θ 6= 1

I here generalize the quantitative analysis to allow for Θ 6= 1. The value of Θ in Marten
and Garbaccio (2018) varies by household, but aggregating yields a value of around 2.5
for the representative household (personal communication). I now require an estimate of
(H − L)/H. As a rough proxy, I use the U-6 measure of unemployment, which accounts
for marginally attached and part-time workers. This measure was around 8.5% in 2017.40
Table A-1 is the analogue of Table 1. The results are only slightly impacted by the change
in Θ. Endogenizing labor supply reduces the energy supply dampener, which mitigates
40

any energy resource savings. (However, the combined multiplier is still greater than 1.)
The wage effect is roughly unchanged for the ten sectors with the greatest energy resource
savings, but the labor supply effect now works to further reduce energy resource use. On net,
the change in the energy supply dampener dominates in these ten sectors, so that improving
their efficiency now generates slightly smaller energy resource savings (i.e., slightly greater
rebound) than reported in the main text. Aggregating over all consumption good sectors,
the combined wage and labor supply effects produce smaller reductions in energy resource
use than did the wage effect reported in the main text, which reinforces the change in the
energy supply dampener and increases rebound slightly. Finally, in the energy supply sector,
the combined wage and labor supply effects work to increase energy resource use to an even
greater degree than did the wage effect reported in the main text, which again reinforces the
change in the energy supply dampener and mitigates energy resource savings.

D.2

Full results for Θ = 1

Table A-2 reports the results omitted from the main text, reporting θR,Ak for each nonenergy supply sector. It aggregates the output price and wage effects into a single “GE”
effect. Sectors are sorted from most negative to most positive total effect. The energy supply
multipliers are as reported in the main text.
