    "abstract": "\n\nHow does access to data shape the rate, quality, and policy relevance of academic research? To shed light on this question, we study the impact of access to confidential microdata through the progressive geographic expansion of the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s Federal Statistical Research Data Centers (FSRDCs). FSRDCs boost the use of confidential microdata and help applied researchers publish more policy- relevant articles in top outlets. Besides direct data usage, this effect also reflects spillovers: exposed researchers are encouraged to explore topics related to FSRDC-enabled findings and employ similar empirical methods. Our findings underscore the importance of data access for scientific progress and evidence-based policy formulation.\n\n",
