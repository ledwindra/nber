ABSTRACT
The paper discusses prior elicitation for the parameters of dynamic stochastic general equilibrium
(DSGE) models, and provides a method for constructing prior distributions for a subset of these parameters
from beliefs about the moments of the endogenous variables. The empirical application studies the
role of price and wage rigidities in a New Keynesian DSGE model and finds that standard macro time
series cannot discriminate among theories that differ in the quantitative importance of nominal frictions.

Introduction

Bayesian methods are now widely used for the estimation and evaluation of dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models. Of particular interest is the question what endogenous propagation mechanisms to include in the DSGE model to capture the salient features
of macroeconomic time series. Several approaches are available in a Bayesian framework:
comparison of impulse responses computed from DSGE models and a structural vector autoregression, e.g., Schorfheide (2000) or Del Negro, Schorfheide, Smets, and Wouters (2007);
an assessment of how far actual sample moments lie in the tails of prior or posterior predictive distributions from DSGE models, e.g., Canova (1994); a comparison of different DSGE
model specifications based on marginal likelihood functions (in-sample fit adjusted for model
complexity), e.g. Smets and Wouters (2003, 2007), and Rabanal and Rubio-Ramirez (2005).
A comprehensive survey is provided in An and Schorfheide (2007). In all of these approaches
prior distributions for the DSGE model parameters play an important role for the analysis.
Despite its importance the literature has paid little attention to the systematic elicitation
of priors.
The paper makes a methodological and a substantive contribution. First, we provide
a framework for constructing priors for different classes of parameters: those determining
the steady state, the endogenous propagation of shocks, and the law of motion of exogenous
disturbances. As part of this framework, we propose an easily implementable method to
elicit prior distributions for DSGE model parameters from beliefs about moments of observable variables. Second, the empirical part of the the paper studies the role of nominal
rigidities in a New Keynesian DSGE model with both nominal and real frictions. We find
that the macro time series we use – post 1982 U.S. data on output, labor supply, labor share,
inflation and interest rates – cannot discriminate among theories that differ in the quantitative importance of these rigidities. Consequently priors play a major role, whence the
need to make explicit the information on which priors are based, and to have a transparent
method for translating this information into statistical distributions, which is the thrust of
our methodological advancement.
Prior distributions either reflect subjective opinions or summarize information derived
from data sets not included in the estimation sample. The latter case is essentially equivalent to simplifying the likelihood function for a larger set of observations that would be
too complicated to model directly. For instance, when pre-sample information is used to
construct a prior, the tacit assumption is that the structure of the economy could have

2

changed prior to the beginning of the estimation sample. Alternatively, priors for parameters that determine labor supply elasticities, mark-ups, frequencies of price changes, and
capital adjustment costs are often quantified based on evidence from household or firm-level
data sets which makes the specification of a joint likelihood function too cumbersome.1
There are three aspects of the prior specification that this paper aims to improve upon.
First, researchers typically assume that all DSGE model parameters are independent. This
assumption is made for simplicity and has the drawback that the resulting joint distribution
assigns non-negligible probability mass to regions of the parameter space where the model is
quite unreasonable. Second, since most of the exogenous shock processes are latent, it is difficult to quantify beliefs about their volatilities and autocorrelations. Informally researchers
often choose priors that ensure that the model is roughly consistent with the autocovariance patterns observed, for instance, in a pre-sample.2 Third, after having specified a prior
distribution for the parameters of a benchmark model, researchers often use the same prior
distribution for alternative model specifications when assessing the relative importance of
various model features. But identical parameterizations of the exogenous shock processes
potentially generate very different dynamics across model specifications. Hence the use of
a common prior for all models can implicitly penalize some specifications and favor others.
We begin by dividing the parameters into three groups, which reflect the information
used to construct the prior. Importantly, the placement of the DSGE model parameters
into these groups depends on the prior information researchers decide to use. The choices
made in this paper are meant to provide guidance but are not meant to be universal. The
first group contains the parameters that determine the steady states. In the calibration
literature initiated by Kydland and Prescott (1982) these parameters are often pinned down
by so-called “great ratios,” or other long-run measures such as the average real interest
rate. Our method turns error-ridden measures of these magnitudes into a joint prior for the
steady state parameters.
The second group includes the taste, technology, and policy parameters governing the
DSGE model’s endogenous propagation mechanism. For many of these parameters prior
information comes from unrelated data sets, e.g. the prior for the labor supply elasticity
parameter comes from micro-level studies on labor supply, the one for the price stickiness
1 As

discussed for instance in Chang, Gomes, and Schorfheide (2002) the prior distribution provides a

useful device for incorporating micro-level information in the estimation of a aggregate time series model.
2 The approach of eliciting priors based on beliefs about predictive densities associated with an econometric model dates back at least to Kadane, Dickey, Winkler, Smith, and Peters (1980).

3

parameters from studies on price changes, et cetera. Therefore for this second group we
maintain the independence assumption standard in the literature.
The parameters describing the propagation mechanism of exogenous shocks (e.g., autocorrelations, standard deviations) belong to the third group.3 We propose a method that
translates priors about reasonable magnitudes for second moments of observables into a joint
prior distribution for these parameters. Such priors may come from pre-sample evidence,
for instance, and are assumed to be invariant across different DSGE model specifications.
The translation occurs via a quasi-likelihood function of the DSGE model that depends
on first and second moments of pre-sample or fictitious observations representing the prior
information.
In the remainder of the paper, Section 2 provides a simple example that illustrates that a
naive choice of prior distributions can distort Bayesian posterior odds for competing models.
Section 3 describes the DSGE model, which is used in Section 4 to present our approach
to prior elicitation. The empirical findings are summarized in Section 5 and Section 6
concludes.

A Simple Example

The typical choice of priors in DSGE model applications has two related shortcomings:
independence across parameters and the mechanical use of the same prior distribution for
alternative model specifications. In this section, we present two simple models to illustrate
the effect of the current practice on model comparisons. We then show how one can construct
an alternative prior in which autoregressive parameters are correlated based on beliefs about
predictive distributions. Model M1 is of the form
yt = θ + t ,

t ∼ iidN (0, 1)

(1)

with the following prior distribution for θ: θ ∼ N (µ, λ2 ). According to M1 the yt ’s are
independent and their marginal distribution is N (µ, λ2 + 1). Model M2 allows for serial
correlation in yt :
yt = θ1 yt−1 + θ2 + t ,

t ∼ N (0, 1).

We will explore two prior distributions for M2 .
3 Canova

(2007) in his discussion of calibration refers to these parameters as “nuisance/auxiliary.”

(2)

4

The first prior is motivated as follows. Since both θ in M1 and θ2 in M2 can be
interpreted as intercepts of a regression function we use the same prior distribution for the
two coefficients and assume that θ2 is independent of θ1 :
Prior P1 :

θ1 ∼ U[0, 1 − ξ],

θ2 |θ1 ∼ N (µ, λ2 ).

(3)

The autoregressive coefficient θ1 is uniformly distributed on the interval [0, 1 − ξ], ξ > 0.
According to (2) the mean of yt is given by µ = θ2 /(1 − θ1 ) and our prior implies that the
variance of the mean is increasing in the persistence of the process


λ2
µ|θ1 ∼ N µ,
.
(1 − θ1 )2
Alternatively, we could interpret the prior for M1 as reflecting the belief that the mean
of yt is normally distributed with mean µ and variance λ2 . A straightforward change-ofvariable argument then leads to the second prior4
Prior P2 :

θ1 ∼ U[0, 1],



θ2 |θ1 ∼ N µ(1 − θ1 ), λ2 (1 − θ1 )2 .

(4)

To illustrate the effect of the prior distributions on model evaluation in situations in
which the sample is not very informative about the parameters, we compute log marginal
likelihood ratios for models M1 and M2 based on two observations y1 and y2 . The two
panels of Figure 1 depict contour plots of log marginal likelihood ratios of M2 (Pj ) versus
M1 , which can be interpreted as log posterior odds if the prior model odds are one. We
chose µ = 1 and λ = 2. Under P1 , a value of the autoregressive parameter close to one
implies a diffuse distribution for the mean of yt and hence a diffuse predictive distribution.
Hence, compared to P2 , prior P1 assigns more mass to realizations of y1 and y2 that have
the same sign and are large in absolute value. As a consequence, the marginal likelihood
for observations that are close to one is smaller for P1 than for P2 . Moreover, under P1
these observations would be interpreted as evidence in favor of M1 , whereas they constitute
evidence in favor of the autoregressive model M2 if the second prior is used. In other
regions of the sample space, the posterior odds are less sensitive to the choice of prior for
M2 . Observations that are large in absolute value and have the identical (opposite) sign,
always provide evidence in favor (against) model M2 .
In this simple example it is straightforward to use change-of-variable arguments to transform prior beliefs over the mean and persistence of an autoregressive process into a prior
4 This

testing.

prior has been used, for instance, in Schotman and Van Dijk (1991) in the context of unit-root

5

distribution for θ1 and θ2 . This transformation ensures that the first two moments of the
predictive distribution of yt are commensurate. In the case if DSGE models, it is often impossible analytically, and hard numerically, to compute the Jacobian terms associated with
the change-of-variables due to the non-linearity of the cross-equation restrictions. Hence,
in Section 4 we propose alternative methods of constructing prior distributions based on
beliefs about the first and second moments of the endogenous variables.

The DSGE Model

This section briefly describes the DSGE model to which we apply our methods of constructing prior distributions. We use a medium-scale New Keynesian model with price and
wage rigidities, capital accumulation, investment adjustment costs, variable capital utilization, and habit formation. The model is based on work of Smets and Wouters (2003) and
Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (2005). The specific version is taken from Del Negro,
Schorfheide, Smets, and Wouters (2007), henceforth DSSW. For brevity we only present the
log-linearized equilibrium conditions and refer the reader to the above referenced papers for
the derivation of these conditions from assumptions on preferences and technologies.
The economy is populated by a continuum of firms that combine capital and labor
to produce differentiated intermediate goods. These firms have access to the same CobbDouglas production function with capital elasticity α and total factor productivity Zt . Total
factor productivity is assumed to be non-stationary, and its growth rate zt = ln(Zt /Zt−1 )
follows the autoregressive process:
zt = (1 − ρz )γ + ρz zt−1 + σz z,t .

(5)

Output, consumption, investment, capital, and the real wage can be detrended by Zt . In
terms of the detrended variables the model has a well-defined steady state. All variables
that appear subsequently are expressed as log-deviations from this steady state.
The intermediate goods producers hire labor and rent capital in competitive markets
and face identical real wages, wt , and rental rates for capital, rtk . Cost minimization implies
that all firms produce with the same capital-labor ratio
kt − Lt = wt − rtk

(6)

mct = (1 − α)wt + αrtk .

(7)

and have marginal costs

6

The intermediate goods producers sell their output to perfectly competitive final good
producers, which aggregate the inputs according to a CES function. Profit maximization of
the final good producers implies that

ybt (j) − ybt = − 1 +

1
λf eλef,t


(pt (j) − pt ).

(8)

Here ybt (j) − ybt and pt (j) − pt are quantity and price for good j relative to quantity and price
of the final good. The price pt of the final good is determined from a zero-profit condition
for the final good producers.
We assume that the price elasticity of the intermediate goods is time-varying. Since
this price elasticity affects the mark-up that intermediate goods producers can charge over
ef,t as mark-up shock. Following Calvo (1983), we assume that
marginal costs, we refer to λ
in every period a fraction of the intermediate goods producers ζp is unable to re-optimize
their prices. A fraction ιp of these firms adjust their prices mechanically according to lagged
inflation, while the remaining fraction 1 − ιp adjusts to steady state inflation π ∗ . All other
firms choose prices to maximize the expected discounted sum of future profits, which leads
to the following equilibrium relationship, known as New Keynesian Phillips curve:
πt =

IE t [πt+1 ] +
πt−1 +
mct + λf,t ,
1 + ιp β
1 + ιp β
ζp (1 + ιp β)

(9)

where πt is inflation and β is the discount rate.5 Our assumption on the behavior of firms
that are unable to re-optimize their prices implies the absence of price dispersion in the
steady state. As a consequence, we obtain a log-linearized aggregate production function of
the form
ybt = (1 − α)Lt + αkt .

(10)

Equations (7), (6), and (10) imply that the labor share lsht equals marginal costs in terms
of log-deviations: lsht = mct .
There is a continuum of households with identical preferences, which are separable in
consumption, leisure, and real money balances. Households’ preferences display (internal)
habit formation in consumption, that is, period t utility is a function of ln(Ct − hCt−1 ).
Households supply monopolistically differentiated labor services. These services are aggregated according to a CES function that leads to a demand elasticity 1 + 1/λw (see
Equation (8)). The composite labor services are then supplied to the intermediate goods
producers at real wage wt . To introduce nominal wage rigidity, we assume that in each
period a fraction ζw of households is unable to re-optimize their wages. A fraction ιw of

7
these households adjust their t − 1 nominal wage by πt−1 eγ , where γ represents the average
growth rate of the economy, while the remaining fraction 1 − ιp adjusts to steady state wage
growth π ∗ eγ . All other households re-optimize their wages. First-order conditions imply
that

(11)

where w̃t is the optimal real wage relative to the real wage for aggregate labor services,
wt , and νl would be the inverse Frisch labor supply elasticity in a model without wage
rigidity (ζw = 0) and differentiated labor. Moreover, φt is a preference shock that affects
the intratemporal substitution between consumption and leisure. The real wage paid by
intermediate goods producers evolves according to
wt = wt−1 − πt − zt + ιw πt−1 +

1 − ζw
w̃t .

(12)

Households are able to insure the idiosyncratic wage adjustment shocks with state contingent claims. As a consequence they all share the same marginal utility of consumption
ξt , which is given by the expression:
(eγ − hβ)(eγ − h)ξt = −(e2γ + βh2 )ct + βheγ IE t [ct+1 + zt+1 ] + heγ (ct−1 − zt ),

(13)

where ct is consumption. In addition to state-contingent claims households accumulate
three types of assets: one-period nominal bonds that yield the return Rt , capital k̄t , and
real money balances. Since preferences for real money balances are assumed to be additively
separable and monetary policy is conducted through a nominal interest rate feedback rule,
money is block exogenous and we will not use the households’ money demand equation in
our empirical analysis.
The first order condition with respect to bond holdings delivers the standard Euler
equation:
ξt = IE t [ξt+1 ] + Rt − IE t [πt+1 ] − IE t [zt+1 ].

(14)

Capital accumulates according to the following law of motion:


k̄t = (2 − eγ − δ) k̄t−1 − zt + (eγ + δ − 1)it ,

(15)

where it is investment, δ is the depreciation rate of capital. Investment in our model
is subject to adjustment costs, and S 00 denotes the second derivative of the investment

adjustment cost function at steady state. Optimal investment satisfies the following firstorder condition:

(17)

Capital utilization ut in our model is variable and rtk in the previous equation represents the
rental rate of effective capital kt = ut + k̄t−1 . The optimal degree of utilization is determined
by
ut =

a00 t

(18)

Here a00 is the derivative of the per-unit-of-capital cost function a(ut ) evaluated at the steady

Rt = ρR Rt−1 + (1 − ρR )(ψ1 πt + ψ2 ybt ) + σR R,t .
where R,t represent policy shocks. The aggregate resource constraint is given by:

Here c∗ /y∗ and i∗ /y∗ are the steady state consumption-output and investment-output ratios,
respectively, and g∗ /(1 + g∗ ) corresponds to the government share of aggregate output. The
process gt can be interpreted as exogenous government spending shock. It is assumed that
fiscal policy is passive in the sense that the government uses lump-sum taxes to satisfy its
period budget constraint.
We find the steady states for the detrended variables and use the method in Sims (2002)
to construct a log-linear approximation of the model around the steady state. All subsequent
statements about the DSGE model are statements about its log-linear approximation. We
collect all the DSGE model parameters in the vector θ, stack the structural shocks in the
vector t , and derive a state-space representation for our vector of observables yt , which is
composed of

time-varying preference parameter φt that appears in the households’ utility function.

Forming Priors for DSGE Models

We group the DSGE model parameters into three broad categories. First, we use θ(ss)
to denote parameters that can be easily identified from steady state relationships among
observable variables:
θ(ss) = [α, β, γ, δ, λf , π∗ , g∗ , Ladj ]0 .
Second, let θ(exo) denote the parameters that characterize the law of motion of the exogenous
processes
θ(exo) = [ρz , σz , ρφ , σφ , ρλf , σλf , ρg , σg , σr ]0 .
Finally, we stack the remaining parameters in the vector θ(endo) :6
θ(endo) = [ζp , ιp , ζw , ιw , λw , s00 , h, a00 , νl , ψ1 , ψ2 , ρr ]0 .
We will in turn describe our method of forming prior distributions for the parameters in
these three blocks. Prior distributions in the context of DSGE model estimation are by and
large designed to reflect empirical observations that are excluded from the likelihood function
because it would be impractical to specify a more encompassing structural econometric
model. Three leading examples of such observations are (i) pre-sample data, e.g., the prior
is influenced by pre-1982 observations, whereas the estimation sample is restricted to post1982 data because of a potential monetary policy change; (ii) the use of data from other
countries, e.g., a prior for a DSGE model of the Euro Area is specified based on U.S. data;
(iii) the use of observations that are concurrent to the estimation sample but excluded
from the likelihood function, e.g., aggregate capital stock data or micro-level data that are
informative about labor supply behavior or price rigidities.
6 Some

of the parameters in θ(endo) do affect steady states. For instance, the habit formation parameter

h affects the steady state of the marginal utility of consumption. Nonetheless, we included these parameters
in the vector θ(endo) instead of θ(ss) because these parameters tend to affect steady states of variables that
are difficult to measure in the data.

10

4.1

Forming Priors for Steady-State Related Parameters

Following the work by Kydland and Prescott (1982), there is a long tradition in the business
cycle literature to use long-run averages of macroeconomic time series to infer values for
those parameters of the DSGE model that are related to steady states. We use this basic
insight to derive a prior for the vector θ(ss) from beliefs about plausible values of such longrun averages that are based on pre-sample observations or data from other countries. The
parameters γ, π∗ , and Ladj are directly tied to the steady state growth rate of aggregate
output, steady state inflation, and the steady state of hours worked. The other parameters
in θ(ss) can be linked to “great ratios” as follows. The steady state labor share and the ratio
of consumption and investment relative to output are given by
lsh∗ = (1 − α)(1 + λf ),

c∗ + i∗
= 1/g∗ .
y∗

The Investment-capital and capital-output ratios can be expressed as
i∗
= e−γ (δ − 1) + 1,
k̄∗

k̄∗
α
=
[β −1 − e−γ (1 − δ)]−1 .
y∗

The drawbacks of specifying a prior distribution directly on the elements of θ(ss) and assuming independence are twofold: First, choosing the prior means for the elements of θ(ss)
so that they jointly satisfy a set of steady state conditions can be cumbersome in a multidimensional case. Second, and most important, the joint prior potentially assigns substantial
mass to parameter combinations that imply unreasonable steady-state relationships.
Instead, we propose to use fictitious measurements of the steady states to construct a
prior distribution for θ(ss) implicitly. Let SD (θ(ss) ) be a vector-valued function that relates
DSGE model parameters and steady states and Sb a vector of fictitious measurements
Sb = SD (θ(ss) ) + η,

(21)

where η is a vector of measurement errors. We express (21) in terms of a conditional

b D (θ(ss) )) and use Bayes theorem in
density (likelihood function) L SD (θ(ss) )|Sb = p(S|S
combination with a marginal density π(θ(ss) ) to generate a conditional distribution that
reflects beliefs about steady-state relationships:


b ∝ L SD (θ(ss) )|Sb π(θ(ss) .
p(θss |S)

(22)

The term π(θ(ss) ) allows for the possibility that the researcher possesses information on

the steady state parameters other than that contained in the term L SD (θ(ss) )|Sb . Two
features of this prior are noteworthy. First, the information obtained from the steady states

11

can be overidentifying in the sense that the dimension of SD (·) exceeds the dimension of
θ(ss) . Second, even if the elements of the vector of measurement errors η are independent,
the function SD (·) will induce dependence among the elements of θ(ss) . The researcher has
to choose the vector Sb and make some assumptions about the distribution of the error term
η in (21). We will re-visit this issue in Section 5.

4.2

Forming Priors for Shock Related Parameters

We now turn to the specification of prior distributions for the parameters associated with
the exogenous shock processes. Whenever the shock processes are latent, it is difficult to
quantify such priors. In practice, many researchers informally specify priors for θ(exo) in
an iterative manner. Starting from some initial distribution, one assesses moments of the
implied predictive distribution of observable endogenous variables. The prior for θ(exo) is
adjusted until the predictive distribution has the desired properties, for instance, in the sense
that it represents prior beliefs formed based on a pre-sample. We provide a formalization
of this approach.
To fix ideas, consider a simplified version of the DSGE model presented in Section 3
where we drop capital as factor of production. This means that the parameters δ, s00 , and
a00 become obsolete. We further impose the following parameter restrictions
α = 0, γ = 0, π∗ = 1, g∗ = 1, ιp = 0, ιw = 0, h = 0, ψ1 = 1/β, ψ2 = 0, ρr = 0.
We also shut down the government spending and the monetary policy shock for the sake of
exposition: σg = 0 and σr = 0. The slopes of the price and wage Phillips curves are denoted
by the parameters κp and κw , respectively, which are functions of the Calvo parameters ζp
and ζw . One can obtain analytical solutions for output, inflation, and the labor share in
terms of the structural shocks.

Equations (23) and (24) highlight the relationship between the endogenous variables ybt ,
πt , lsht and the exogenous shock processes φt , λf,t , and zt . Conditional on the parameters
θ(ss) and θ(endo) , priors on θ(exo) translate into priors on the moments of the joint predictive
distribution of output, inflation, and the labor share. Vice versa, one can “invert” Equations (23) and (24) to elicit a prior for θ(exo) from moments of a predictive distribution
for the observables. The latter approach suggests that prior distributions for the shock
processes should be specific to a particular model specification.
Consider, for instance, the mark-up disturbance λf,t . If prices are assumed to be flexible as in (24), then the volatility and persistence of mark-up process and labor share are
identical. Thus, a prior for ρλ,f and σλ,f can be formed directly based on views about the
stochastic properties of the labor share. Alternatively, in a model in which prices are sticky,
the real wage dynamics are also affected by the preference shock φt and the technology
growth process zt , which implies that it is implausible in the context of the sticky price
model to equate beliefs about the persistence and volatility of real wages and the mark-up
shock. We now describe a general method that allows us to translate views about the predictive distribution of the observed endogenous variables into a prior distribution for the
parameters of the exogenous shock processes.

4.3

Quasi-Likelihood Based Priors

We use a (quasi)-likelihood function to translate prior beliefs about the distribution of observables, represented by a vector of fictitious observations, into a distribution for the model

13

parameters. In principle, one could use the likelihood function of the DSGE for this purpose.
We use instead the likelihood function associated with an approximating model, for which
there exists a low-dimensional vector of sufficient statistics. The advantage of our approach
is that the researcher only needs to specify values for the sufficient statistics on which she
has formed beliefs, rather than specifying a full time series of fictitious observations.
Our approximating model is a p’th order VAR of the form
yt = Φ0 + Φ1 yt−1 + . . . + Φp yt−p + ut ,

ut ∼ N (0, Σ),

where yt is an n × 1 vector of observables. Let xt be the k × 1 vector [1, yt−1
, . . . , yt−p
]0 and

re-write the VAR as linear regression model
yt0 = x0t Φ + u0t .

(26)

To relate the DSGE model parameters θ to the VAR parameters Φ, Σ, we assume that
the observables have been transformed such that the vector yt is covariance stationary

will write as T ∗ Γ∗Y Y , T ∗ Γ∗Y X , and T ∗ Γ∗XX , respectively. Finally, our prior for the DSGE
model parameters is obtained by interpreting the quasi-likelihood function (pre-multiplied
by |ΣD (θ)|−(n+1)/2 ) as a density of θ:
L(θ|Γ∗ , T ∗ )

The quasi-likelihood (28), and hence the density of θ, is small at values of θ for which
the DSGE model implied autocovariances strongly differ from the Γ∗ ’s. The parameter T ∗
captures the precision of our beliefs: The larger T ∗ , the sharper the peak of L(θ|Γ∗ , T ∗ ).
The most important aspect in the implementation of the prior is the choice of Γ∗ , which
summarizes the information contained in the dummy observations. Suppose that p = 0.
Then Γ∗ only contains information about the mean and the covariance matrix of yt and

14

hence the researcher only uses beliefs about location and scale to construct a prior for θ. If
p = 1 and xt is composed only of yt−1 and the autocovariance matrices in Γ∗ are specified
in terms of deviations of yt from its mean, then the prior for θ will indirectly be based on
beliefs about the covariance matrix of yt and first-order autocorrelations. This will be the
case considered in the empirical implementation in Section 5.
The numerical values for the Γ∗ matrix could be obtained from introspection, calculated
from a pre-sample, or based on data from a different country. If Γ∗ is directly constructed
on the basis of a pre-sample and the lag-length p in the approximating model sufficiently
large, then our quasi-likelihood based prior is similar to the use of a training-sample prior
for the estimation of the DSGE model.7 Finally, in our analysis we allow for the possibility
that the researcher has additional prior information on the parameters of the exogenous
shocks processes θ(exo) . If one adopts a literal interpretation of government spending shocks
as shocks to government consumption, for instance, one can measure their persistence and
standard deviation. Information from this measures, whenever available, is incorporated in
the prior π(θ(exo) ).

4.4

Putting it All Together

Last, we discuss the specification of the prior distribution for θ(endo) , the DSGE model
parameters that control the endogenous propagation mechanism. For many of these parameters the researcher may have beliefs that originate from other sources of information.
For instance, views on the degree of price rigidity or labor supply elasticity may arise from
micro-level studies on the frequency of price changes or labor supply behavior, respectively.
These beliefs are summarized in the informative prior π(θ(endo) ).8
Our overall prior distribution will take the following form

(29)

priors, see for instance Koop (2004), are typically constructed using the likelihood

function of the econometric model that is being estimated, rather than a quasi-likelihood of an approximating
model as in our approach.
8 It is apparent from (23) and (24) that the elements of θ
(endo) affect the distribution of the observables in
a similar way as the θ(exo) parameters. This suggests that one could use a priori views about the moments
of the data to elicit priors on θ(endo) as well, via the quasi-likelihood function described in Section 4.3.
While the implementation of this generalization is straightforward, we do not explore it in this paper.

15

We will refer to this prior as quasi-likelihood prior, PQL . The π(·) terms represent initial
distributions for the model parameters that capture information not contained in the information in the fictitious observations. For most elements of θ(ss) and θ(exo) we use diffuse
densities, mainly to ensure that the resulting prior is proper. Recall that the function SD (·)
was chosen such that it only depends on the subvector θ(ss) . We fixed the parameters θ(ss)
and θ(endo) at the values θ(ss) and θ(endo) in the quasi-likelihood function (28). Hence, we
can factorize the prior as follows:

(32)

The normalization constants c1 and c2 (θ(ss) , θ(endo) ) have to be computed numerically. Conceptually, it would be desirable not to condition the prior for θ(exo) on a particular value
of θ(ss) and θ(endo) and replace (32) by p(θ(exo) |Γ∗ , T ∗ , θ(ss) , θ(endo) ). Unfortunately, this
modification makes the normalization constant c2 a function of the parameter vectors θ(ss)
and θ(endo) , which would have to be evaluated by numerical integration for each value that
these parameters take in a Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo simulation. In the Bayesian literature, this problem is referred to as a problem of an intractable normalization constant.
While there exist computation strategies to deal with such a problem in simple models9 ,
the computational burden in the context of our specific application is large and lead us to
condition on prior mean values θ(ss) and θ(endo) .
Due to the nonlinearity of the functions SD (θ), ΦD (θ) and ΣD (θ) it is not possible to
generate draws from the prior distribution of θ directly. In the application in Section 5 we use
a random-walk Metropolis algorithm, described in detail for instance in An and Schorfheide
(2007), to generate draws from the prior distribution. This algorithm only requires us to
be able to numerically evaluate the prior density (30) up to the normalization constant.
Based on the output of the Metropolis algorithm, Geweke’s (1999) modified harmonic mean
estimator can be used to calculate the normalization constants that appear in (31) and (32).
The same algorithms can be used to obtain draws from the posterior distribution.
9 See,

for instance, Moeller, Pettitt, Reeves, and Berthelsen (2006).

16

A few practical considerations are worth mentioning. As long as the π(·) functions
are integrable, the resulting prior distribution of θ is proper regardless of the choice of


L SD (θ(ss) )|Sb and L θ(ss) , θ(exo) , θ(endo) |Γ∗ , T ∗ . The curvature of the prior density depends on the particular choice of the quasi-likelihood functions. The curvature of the prior
for θ(ss) will depend on the information included in the vector of steady states SD (θ(ss) ).
Likewise, the curvature of the prior for θ(exo) will depend on that of the quasi-likelihood.
Conditional on θ(ss) and θ(endo) it is typically possible to determine the parameters governing the law of motion of the exogenous shocks, θ(exo) , from the autocovariances of order
zero and one. Hence in our application the prior density will have enough curvature even
for small values of T ∗ and p for the above mentioned Markov-Chain Monte Carlo methods
to work satisfactorily. If one were to rely exclusively on the quasi-likelihood to form a prior
on both θ(exo) and θ(endo) , this may result in a prior that is flat in certain dimensions (see
Canova and Sala 2007), which in turn may generate computational issues. Finally, it is
important to note that we do not view the quasi-likelihood as a substitute for other sources
of prior information if such information is available. We view it as a tool to elicit priors for
those parameters for which it is difficult to form a prior directly.

Assessing the Role of Nominal Rigidities

In the empirical section we use the framework discussed earlier to investigate the importance
of price and wage rigidities. In this investigation we account for the existence of different
a priori views regarding the importance of nominal rigidities. These prior disagreements
reflect either different interpretation of the results of micro studies on rigidities, different
assessments on the importance of strategic complementarities, but also more generally deeprooted convictions regarding the importance of nominal frictions.
In our Bayesian setting, these a priori convictions are characterized by the priors on the
stickiness parameters ζp and ζw summarized in Table 1. The priors in the first column of
Table 1 are “non-dogmatic:” In principle all these priors put non-zero weight on the entire
admissible range, hence with lots of data the likelihood would dominate in all three cases.
In practice two of these priors, the Low and High Rigidities, are quite informative, hence
with moderate amount of data they can affect the posterior. The Low Rigidities prior is
roughly centered at the Bils and Klenow (2004) estimate of price stickyness for ζp , which
implies an average frequency of price adjustment of between one and two and half quarters,
and puts little mass on frequencies above three quarters. This prior assumes that nominal

17

wage rigidity is similarly low. The High Rigidities prior is centered at 0.75 for ζp and ζw ,
which implies that the frequency of price and wage adjustment is on average four quarters.
Most importantly, this prior puts virtually no mass on frequencies below two quarters. The
last prior, called Agnostic because it is less informative, spans both the regions where the
informative priors put most of the mass. We will sometimes refer to these different views
of the world as models or specifications. The priors in the remaining column of Table 1
are “dogmatic:” Since either ζp (Flexible Prices) or ζw (Flexible Wages) are set to zero,
there can be no updating in these dimensions. For the rigidity we do not shut down, we
consider three different values corresponding to the Low, High rigidity, and Agnostic case.
The “dogmatic” priors are of interest not only because the existing literature (Rabanal and
Rubio-Ramirez (2005), Smets and Wouters (2003, 2007)) has focused on these polar cases,
but also since they treat price and wage rigidity asymmetrically.
Regardless of how these a priori views are formed, an important question is which view
of the world best describes the data. In the Bayesian framework, this question is addressed
by comparing the posterior odds associated with the different priors. The problem we face
is that the priors for the other parameters, and in particular for the parameters describing
the exogenous processes, can affect this comparison. The standard practice in the Bayesian
DSGE model estimation literature is to form a prior for these parameters by 1) assuming
independence, and 2) maintaining the same prior across different specifications. We denote
this standard prior as PS . The alternative prior, which we developed in Section 4, is called
quasi-likelihood prior and is denoted by PQL .

5.1

Priors: Standard versus Quasi-Likelihood

We start the section by describing in detail the priors we use. We begin by focusing on
those parameters (θ(ss) and θ(endo) ) whose priors do not change across specifications, given
that the information on which the priors are based (great ratios, micro studies, et cetera) is
arguably specification-invariant.
The prior for the steady state related parameters has two components: π(θ(ss) ) and
b
L(SD (θ(ss) |S)).
We use π(θ(ss) ) to represent the prior view that the discount factor is
about 0.996, the average annual growth rate of the economy is about 1.65%, the average
mark-up is 15%, the inflation rate is 4.3%, and the mean level of ours worked per capita is

18
about 1000 hours per year.10 Prior standard deviations for these parameters are reported in
the last column of Table 2. π(θ(ss) ) is constant as a function of α, δ, and g∗ . As is standard
practice in the literature π(θ(ss) ) is generated as product of marginal densities. We depart
b to induce
from the existing literature by using the quasi-likelihood function L(SD (θ(ss) )|S))
an informative distribution for α, δ, and g∗ . Table 2 contains fictitious measurements
of the labor share, the ratio of the sum of consumption and investment to output, the
investment-capital ratio, and the capital-output ratio (see the data section in the appendix
for a discussion of how these numbers are computed). The Para (1) entries correspond to
b and the Para (2) entries to the standard deviations associated with the η’s in (21). The
S,
b is constructed by assuming that the elements of η are independently
function L(SD (θ(ss) )|S))
and normally distributed.
We now turn to the priors for θ(endo) . The function π(θ(endo) ) is a product of marginal
densities summarized in the bottom half of Table 2. The priors for the degree of price
and wage stickiness are the focus of the model comparison exercise and were discussed in
Table 1. The 90% interval for the prior distribution on νl implies that the Frisch labor
supply elasticity lies between 0.3 and 1.3, reflecting the micro-level estimates at the lower
end, and the estimates of Kimball and Shapiro (2003) and Chang and Kim (2006) at the
upper end. The distribution for ψ1 is centered at a value of 2 with a standard deviation
of 0.25, conditioning on the view that the central bank responded strongly to inflation
movements in the Volcker-Greenspan era. The prior distribution for ψ2 is approximately
centered at 0.2, whereas the smoothing parameter lies in the range from 0.17 to 0.83. The
densities for the indexation parameters ιp and ιw are nearly uniform over the unit interval.
The density for the adjustment cost parameter s00 spans values that Christiano, Eichenbaum,
and Evans (2005) find when matching DSGE and VAR impulse response functions. The
density for the habit persistence parameter h is centered at 0.7, which is the value used
by Boldrin, Christiano, and Fisher (2001). These authors find that h = 0.7 enhances the
ability of a standard DSGE model to account for key asset market statistics. The density
for a00 implies that in response to a 1% increase in the return to capital, utilization rates rise
by 0.1 to 0.3%. These numbers are considerably smaller than the one used by Christiano,
Eichenbaum, and Evans (2005).11
10 We

introduce the following re-parameterizations:
r(A) = 400 ∗ (1/β − 1),

11 One

π(A) = 400(π∗ − 1),

γ(A) = 400γ.

can argue that on the last five elements of θ(endo) , namely {ιp , ιw , s00 , h, a00 }, the information from

micro studies is fairly limited, and that those parameters are often calibrated to fit the data. Following

19

The prior for the θ(exo) , the parameters characterizing the exogenous processes (the
ρ’s and σ’s), is summarized in Table 3 under both the standard prior (PS ) and our approach (PQL ). Under PS this prior is the product of independent marginal distributions:
π(θ(exo) ) = Πi πi (θi,(exo) ), where i indexes the elements of θ(exo) . These distributions are
shown in the left-hand side of Table 3. The prior for ρz , which measures the serial correlation of technology growth is centered at 0.4, whereas the priors for the other autocorrelation
parameters are centered at 0.75 with a standard deviation of 0.15. These kind of prior
settings for the ρ’s, which are fairly informative, are standard in the literature. The priors
for the σ’s are loosely chosen to obtain realistic magnitudes for the implied volatilities and
autocorrelation of the endogenous variables under the Low Rigidities specification.
Under PQL the prior for the θ(exo) parameters is given by the product of two pieces
(see expression 32): a standard prior π(θ(exo) ), which is specified in the right-hand side of
Table 3, times the quasi-likelihood function. Unlike in the standard approach, π(θ(exo) ) is
largely uninformative. The prior for all the ρ’s is a Beta distribution with mean 0.45 and
standard deviation 0.25. This density is almost flat, although gently downward sloping, for
most of the [0, 1) interval, but drops sharply as ρ gets very close to one. This is a convenient
feature from the computational point of view, as it avoids posterior peaks with ρ stuck at the
upper corner of the interval. The prior density for the shock standard deviations is chosen
to be proportional to 1/σ. Under PQL the information in the prior comes from the quasi
likelihood function L θ(ss) , θ(exo) , θ(endo) |Γ∗ , T ∗ , which is constructed based on a VAR with
lag length p = 1 for demeaned observations on output growth, hours worked, labor share,
inflation, and interest rates. To specify Γ∗ we are using pre-sample autocovariance matrices
of order zero and one. We consider different choices of T ∗ in the subsequent empirical
analysis (T ∗ = 4, 6, 10), but to save space we only show results for T ∗ = 6.
Table 4 compares the mean and 90% intervals for the parameters describing the exogenous processes under the standard (PS ) and (PQL ) prior for the different specifications
described in Table 1.12 The point of Table 4 is that many of these numbers, particularly for
the autocorrelation parameters, do not look at all that different across specifications. The
priors for the σ’s are quite different, but it is hard to tell their implications for the models.
It would be hard to argue solely on the basis of these numbers that one prior is more or less
this argument, one may as well do this explicitly (using the presample) and include these parameters in the
Quasi-Likelihood. We have actually done this in a set of results we do not report because they are similar
to those in the paper.
12 For the “dogmatic” specifications, Flexible Wages and Prices, we only show the prior under the Agnostic
rigidity specification to save space.

20

reasonable than the other. Yet these priors can make substantial differences in terms of the
model implications for impulse responses and moments of the observables, as we are going
to show. In turn, this will affect model comparisons.
Figure 2 shows four sets of impulse responses. The top set shows the responses to a
mark-up shock obtained under the standard prior for the Low Rigidities (grey, dash-anddotted) and the High Rigidities (black, solid) specification. The second set shows the same
responses under the PQL prior. It is apparent that the standard prior generates very different
implications for the two specifications. In particular, the standard prior implies that for
the High Rigidities specification mark-up shocks generate what look like implausibly large
movements in the observables. Moreover, these shocks generate a large negative correlation
between the labor share and inflation, which is also apparent in the simplified model of
Section 5.2.13 From Galı́ and Gertler (1999) we know that such negative correlation is
likely to be counterfactual. The second panel shows that under the PQL prior the impulse
responses for the two specifications, while not identical, are at least of a similar order of
magnitude. The responses for the Low Rigidities specification do not change dramatically
relative to the PS prior, which is not surprising given that the standard deviations in the
PS prior were loosely calibrated on the Low Rigidities specification. The last two panels of
Figure 2 show the responses to a policy shock under the two specifications. Not surprisingly,
these are quite different for the two specifications, as they should be. Under the PQL prior
such differences persist: the PQL and PS are about the same. In summary, the PS prior is
likely to penalize the High Rigidities specification. The PQL prior appears to remove the
penalty, but at the same time maintains the identifying differences between the two models.
Figure 3 shows the implications of using the PS versus the PQL prior for some of the
moments of the observables. The Figure shows three sets of plots. The first set depicts
the correlation of inflation and the labor share at different lags. The second and third sets
depict the autocorrelation of inflation and the labor share, respectively. In each plot the thick
dark gray line with crosses represents the statistics as computed from the data (the actual
sample used in the estimation, as opposed to that used for the construction of the prior).
The black solid and grey dash-and-dotted lines represent the very same statistics computed
from the model under the High Rigidities and Low Rigidities specification, respectively.
These statistics are computed by generating parameters from the prior and, conditional on
each draw, a size T time series from the model. We repeat this exercise 200,000 times and
compute the median and the 90% bands for the statistics: These are the objects shown in

algebraic manipulations of (23) reveal that ∂πt /∂λf,t > 0 and ∂lsht /∂λf,t < 0.

21

Figure 3. The statistics are computed using both the PS (left column) and the PQL prior
(right column).
From the discussion of Figure 2 it should not be surprising to find that under PS the
High Rigidities specification puts substantial mass on negative correlations between inflation
and the labor share (top left chart). The median contemporaneous correlation is −0.4.
The Low Rigidities specification is somewhat closer to the data. Under the PQL prior the
implications for the two specifications are close to each other.14 The remaining plots show
that for the autocorrelation function of inflation and the labor share the difference between
the two specifications is not stark. This is true under both the PS and the PQL prior.
Both specifications can roughly match the persistence of inflation and the labor share. If
anything, both tend to over-predict the one lag autocorrelation of inflation, which is not
very high.

5.2

Posterior Estimates and Model Comparison

The priors in Table 1 capture various hypothesis on the degree of nominal rigidities in the
economy. Which one is correct? We address this question by looking at the relative fit of
the models, as measured by marginal likelihoods. We also look at the posterior estimates
of the rigidity parameters. The role of the quasi-likelihood prior in this exercise is to try
levelling the playing field among the different specifications.
Table 5 shows the log marginal likelihoods for different specifications under both the
standard prior PS (left panel) and the quasi-likelihood prior PQL (right panel). The comparison among the “non-dogmatic” specifications, on the left column of each panel, is our
main focus. The relative fit of the “dogmatic” specifications, Flexible Wages and Prices, is
also informative however as it sheds light on which rigidity may be most needed to describe
the data, sticky prices or wages. The model comparison results for the “non-dogmatic”
specifications under the PS prior are striking, since all models seem to describe the data
roughly equally well. The marginal likelihood differences are less than 1.5, which is small,
14 An

interesting feature of the data sample we use is that Corr(Labor Share(t), Inflation(t + k)) is in-

creasing in k, unlike in the sample used by Galı́ and Gertler (1999). In other words there seems to be little
(unconditional) predictive power of inflation for future labor share, while current labor share predicts future
inflation. Moreover the contemporaneous correlation is positive but small. As Figure 3 shows however, this
is no evidence against the New-Keynesian model. Even under the High Rigidities specification the model is
able to roughly replicate this pattern.

22

in particular if one factors in the numerical approximation error associated with these highdimensional integrals. Thus, we find that the data cannot discriminate among the Low ,
High Rigidities, and Agnostic specifications. Under the PQL prior (right panel) the fit of
the Low Rigidities specification is clearly worse than that of the other two – mainly because
the fit of these specifications improve after levelling the playing field. Yet it is still the case
that the High Rigidities and Agnostic specifications describe the data equally well.
If for all the specifications with similar fit the posterior estimates for the Calvo parameters ζp and ζw were similar, this finding would not be noteworthy, as there is no posterior
disagreement about the magnitude of the nominal rigidities. However, it turns out that the
posterior estimates for the Calvo parameters are heavily influenced by the priors and quite
different. The left and right panels of Table 6 show the posterior mean and 90% posterior
intervals under the standard and quasi-likelihood prior, respectively.15 The estimates for ζp
indicate that some degree of price rigidity is needed to describe the data, although precisely
how much depends on the prior. These estimates range from about 0.6 for the Low Rigidities
to about 0.8 for the High Rigidities specification. The conclusion that some degree of price
rigidity is needed is confirmed by the fact that the fit of the Flexible Prices specification is
always much worse than that of the corresponding non-dogmatic model (see Table 5).
The assessment of the importance of wage rigidities depends even more on the prior
views. Under the Low Rigidities specification the posterior estimates of ζw are quite low,
about 0.25, while under the High Rigidities prior they are high, between 0.75 and 0.80.
The model comparison results also indicate that the answer to the question “Do we need
nominal wage rigidities?” is less robust than in the price rigidity case. The fit of the Flexible
Wages specification is worse than that of the corresponding non-dogmatic model under High
Rigidities, both under PS and PQL . For the Low Rigidities case the fit of the Flexible Wages
specification is worse than that of the corresponding non-dogmatic model under PS , but
slightly better under PQL . Moreover, the results suggest that, without price rigidity, wage
rigidity may not help much to describe the data: In the Flexible Prices specification the
posterior estimates of ζw are always very small, even under the High Rigidities specification
(the posterior mean is always below 0.25).16
15 In

the discussion we focus mainly on ζp and ζw , but we also tabulate the estimates for the remaining

endogenous propagation (θ(endo) ) and the exogenous persistence parameters for full disclosure.
16 We do not show the posterior estimates for the “dogmatic” specifications for brevity. They are available
upon request. An additional piece of evidence on the complementarity between wage and price rigidity
is that, under the Agnostic/PS prior, where the posterior of ζw spans both the low and the high rigidity
region, the posterior correlation between ζw and ζp is 0.89.

23

We conjecture that the presence of the labor share among the observables is one of the
reasons for the lack of compelling evidence in favor of wage stickiness: In absence of substantial price rigidity, the model with high wage rigidity has a hard time explaining the joint
behavior of the labor share, inflation, and output. With low price rigidities movements in
the labor share are dominated by mark-up shocks, which tend to generate a counterfactual
negative correlation between labor share and inflation. Indeed the evidence in favor of nominal wage rigidities is much stronger whenever the labor share is not among the observables.
Table 7 shows the model comparison results and the posterior estimates of ζp and ζw when
the labor share is not among the observables. The estimates of ζw are much higher than in
Table 6, and the Low Rigidity specification is soundly rejected by the data.
In summary, the following two models seem to fit the data equally well: One where
price rigidities are moderate and wage rigidity is trivial, and one where both rigidities are
high. These two models have strikingly different policy implication, as shown by Figure 4.
The Figure plots the impulse responses to a policy shocks for High Rigidities (solid black
lines) and the Agnostic case (grey dash-and-dotted lines) under PQL (results under PS are
similar). It is clear that the reduction in output following a decrease in inflation varies
substantially between these two models.

Conclusions

The choice of priors for DSGE model parameters matters for both posterior estimates and
model comparison. Part of this paper’s contribution is to provide a framework for eliciting
priors for different classes of parameters: those determining the steady state, the endogenous
propagation mechanism, and the law of motion of the exogenous disturbances. The main
thrust of our approach is to make explicit the information on which priors are based, whether
that comes from the pre-sample or other sources, and to provide a systematic approach for
translating this information into priors.
The paper uses the approach to investigate the importance of nominal rigidities within
a standard New-Keynesian model with several real rigidities. In the profession there are
widely diverging views on this subject. One would think that if the macro data spoke very
clearly one way or the other, some consensus may eventually emerge as information from
the data eventually trumps people’s priors. The results in this paper suggest that this is not
yet the case. The macro time series we consider – output growth, labor supply, labor share,
inflation and interest rates – are not informative enough to discriminate among different

24

theories, in spite of being a natural choice of observables for the question at hand. We
indeed show that posterior estimates of the nominal rigidities parameters to some extent
mirror the prior views. We also show that the model comparison results are in general not
robust to the choice of prior for the parameters describing the exogenous shock processes,
as these priors may inadvertently favor one specification relative to another. One promising
approach to discriminating among theories is to gather evidence from micro data on the
degree of rigidities (see Bils and Klenow 2004, Nakamura and Steinsson 2007) but it remains
a challenge to understand how micro-level rigidities aggregate to macro-level rigidities.

Data

The data set is obtained from Haver Analytics (Haver mnemonics are in italics). We compile
observations for the variables that appear in the measurement equation (21). Real output is
obtained by dividing the nominal series (GDP) by population 16 years and older (LN16N),
and deflating using the chained-price GDP deflator (JGDP). We compute quarter-to-quarter
output growth as log difference of real GDP per capita and multiply the growth rates by
100 to convert them into percentages. Our measure of hours worked is computed by taking
total hours worked reported in the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA), which
is at annual frequency, and interpolating it using growth rates computed from hours of all
persons in the non-farm business sector (LXNFH). We divide hours worked by LN16N to
convert them into per capita terms. We then take the log of the series multiplied by 100
so that all figures can be interpreted as percentage changes in hours worked. The labor
share is computed by dividing total compensation of employees (YCOMP) obtained from
the NIPA by nominal GDP. We then take the log of the labor share multiplied by 100. Inflation rates are defined as log differences of the GDP deflator and converted into annualized
percentages. The nominal rate corresponds to the effective Federal Funds Rate (FFED),
also in percent. We use a pre-sample of observations from 1954:III to 1980:IV to specify
the prior distribution. Our estimation sample ranges from 1982:IV to 2005:IV. Annual data
on consumption, durable consumption, investment, and capital used to construct the great
ratios included in Ŝ (see Table 2 ) also come from Haver Analytics (with mnemonics C, CD,
IDGA, and E, respectively). Since these variables are not included among the observables
we use the entire sample (1954-2006) to obtain information on the great ratios. The average
labor share measurement included in Ŝ comes from the pre-sample.

Notes: For each plot the thick dark gray line with crosses represents the statistics (Corr(Labor Share(t),Inflation(t+
k)), Corr(Inflation(t),Inflation(t + k)), Corr(Labor Share(t),Labor Share(t + k))) as computed from the data. The
black solid and grey dash-and-dotted lines represent the statistics computed from the model under the High
Rigidities and Low Rigidities specification, respectively. These statistics are computed by generating parameters
from the prior and, conditional on each draw, a size T time series from the model. We repeat this exercise 200,000
times and compute the median and the 90% bands for the statistics. The statistics are computed using both the
PS (left column) and the PQL prior (right column).
