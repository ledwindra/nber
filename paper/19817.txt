Misinformed Speculators and Mispricing in the Housing Market
Alex Chinco and Christopher Mayer
NBER Working Paper No. 19817
January 2014
JEL No. G14,R3
ABSTRACT
This paper uses transactions-level deeds records to examine how out-of-town second house buyers
contributed to mispricing in the housing market. We document that out-of-town second house buyers
behaved like misinformed speculators and drove up both house price and implied-to-actual rent ratio
(IAR) appreciation rates in cities like Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Miami in the mid 2000s. Our analysis
has 3 parts. First, we give evidence that out-of-town second house buyers behaved like misinformed
speculators. Compared to local second house buyers, out- of-town second house buyers had worse
exit timing (i.e., were likely misinformed) and were also less able to consume the dividend from their
purchase (i.e., were likely speculators). Second, we show that increases in out-of-town second house
buyer demand predict increases in future house price appreciation rates and IAR appreciation rates.
A 10%pt increase in the fraction of sales made to out-of-town second house buyers is associated with
a 6%pt increase in house price appreciation rates and a 9%pt increase in IAR appreciation rates over
the course of the next year in that city. Third, we address the issue of reverse causality using a novel
econometric strategy. The key insight is that an increase in the fundamental value of owning a second
house in Phoenix is a common shock to the investment opportunity set of all potential second house
buyers. If changes to fundamentals were driving both price dynamics as well as out-of-town second
house buyer demand, we would expect to see large jumps in house price and IAR appreciation rates
preceded by increases in out-of-town second house buyer demand from across the country. The data
do not display this symmetric response, and are thus inconsistent with reverse causality. We conclude
by discussing both the economic magnitudes of out-of-town second house buyer flows and the broader
applicability of our econometric approach.

ALEX CHINCO AND CHRIS MAYER

1. Introduction
Researchers have long puzzled over the ineﬃciency of housing prices. Starting with the seminal
paper by Case and Shiller (1989), analysts have documented the predictability of home prices:
positive short-run serial correlation and negative serial correlation in the long-run. For a broader
discussion of the literature on mispricing in the residential housing market see Mayer (2010). More
recently, Glaeser, Gottlieb, and Gyourko (2010) have pointed out that fundamental factors like
declining interest rates, income growth, and increased credit access cannot explain the price runups in many markets over the previous decade. An additional challenge to models based only
on fundamentals is the fact that the largest price increases occurred in housing markets like Las
Vegas and Phoenix where land supply is quite elastic. Thus researchers have increasingly turned to
examining the role of speculation as an additional factor in explaining the strong increase in housing
prices in certain markets.
This paper uses transactions-level deeds records to document that out-of-town second house
buyers behaved like misinformed speculators, driving up both house price and implied-to-actual
rent ratio (IAR) appreciation rates in cities like Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Miami in the mid 2000s.
In the process we employ a novel econometric approach to address concerns about reverse causality.
Our data list both the property address as well as the tax bill mailing address for every single family
house purchase in 21 cities during the period from January 2000 to December 2007. We use this
information to classify each single family house purchase as made by either an owner occupant, a
local second house buyer, or an out-of-town second house buyer. A local second house buyer is
someone who buys a second house in Phoenix and also lives in Phoenix. An out-of-town second
house buyer is someone who buys a second house in Phoenix but lives year-round in San Francisco.
Our analysis has 3 parts. First, in Section 3 we give evidence that out-of-town second house
buyers behaved like misinformed speculators. We start by showing that out-of-town second house
buyers had worse exit timing than local second house buyers—i.e., were likely misinformed. Out-oftown second house buyers realized roughly 6% per year lower capital gains on their purchases than
local second house buyers who bought at the exact same time in the exact same city as illustrated

of purchases made each month in Phoenix by each buyer type. Sample: January 2000 to December
2008. Reads: “While local second house buyers who bought in March 2005 earned nearly an 11% per
year capital gain on their purchase, out-of-town second house buyers who bought in the same month
earned only a 5% per year capital gain on these purchases.”

in Figure 1. Then, we show that out-of-town second house buyers were less able to consume the
housing dividend from their purchase due to their distance from the house. A typical property
manager charges a fee of 1 month’s rent plus an additional 8% of the annual rent each year to lease
a house and manage relations with the tenant. As a result, these buyers must have relied more on
price appreciation in their ex ante return calculations—i.e., were likely speculators. Finally, we show
that out-of-town second house buyers don’t appear to have fundamentally diﬀerent preferences than
local second house buyers. These buyers weren’t just the super rich since the median value of their
primary residences was actually lower than that of the median sale price in many cities. Moreover,
at peak the typical out-of-town second house buyer in places like Los Angeles and Jacksonville
owned 2 investment properties making diversiﬁcation an unlikely motivation.
Second, in Section 4 we show that increases in out-of-town second house buyer demand predict
increases in future house price and IAR appreciation rates. A 10%pt increase in the fraction of
sales made to out-of-town second house buyers is associated with a 6%pt increase in house price
appreciation rates and a 9%pt increase in IAR appreciation rates over the next year in that city as
depicted in Figure 2. By contrast, increases in local second house buyer demand are not associated
with increases in either house price or IAR appreciation rates. Of course, in order to make statements
about mispricing, we must pick a pricing model. In this paper we subscribe to the user-cost model
and use deviations of city-wide log IAR ratios from zero as a proxy for mispricing. Concretely,
the log of the IAR ratio as calculated as in Himmelberg, Mayer, and Sinai (2005) represents the
excess return over the apartment rental rate of borrowing money, buying a house, living in it for
1 year, and then selling it in a year’s time. The higher the log IAR ratio is, the cheaper it is to
rent rather than buy, and the higher the level of mispricing on the rent-vs-own margin. One of
the main criticisms of this model is that expected house price appreciation rates are an input. To
mitigate this concern we show that our empirical results do not depend on the gritty details of how
this expectation is calculated. In summary, Sections 3 and 4 show that out-of-town second house
buyers behaved like misinformed speculators in the mid 2000s, and increases in demand from these
traders are associated with higher house price and IAR appreciation rates in subsequent months.
Section 5 houses the third and ﬁnal component of our analysis. In this section we ask the natural
follow up question: “Is this just reverse causality? Is it just that changes in fundamentals are both
attracting out-of-town second house buyers and also driving up prices?” No. Our results suggest
this is not the case. The key insight is that an increase in the fundamental value of owning a second
house in Phoenix represents a common shock to the investment opportunity set of all potential
second house buyers. Thus, if changes to fundamentals were driving both price dynamics as well as
out-of-town second house buyer demand, we would expect to see large jumps in house price and IAR
appreciation rates preceded by increases in out-of-town second house buyer demand from across the
country. The data do not display this symmetric response. As a result, they are inconsistent with
an explanation based on reverse causality. To test this prediction econometrically, we condition
our regressions on city size. For instance, we ﬁnd that a 10%pt increase in demand for second
houses in Phoenix by buyers living in Los Angeles predicts a bigger increase in Phoenix house price
and IAR appreciation rates than a 10%pt increase in demand by buyers living in Milwaukee. We
include month and ordered city pair ﬁxed eﬀects in our speciﬁcation to account for variation in

Months After Shock

Figure 2. Response of house price appreciation rates, out-of-town second house buyer demand, and
local second house buyer demand both to (red, solid) a 10%pt increase in the fraction of sales made
to out-of-town second house buyers in Las Vegas as well as to (blue, dashed) no shock. We compute
the ﬁgure using the panel VAR in Equation (9) whose point estimates calculated over the time period
from January 2000 to December 2007 are housed in Table 8. Reads: “In the 12 months following a
10%pt increase in the fraction of purchases made by out-of-town second house buyers in Las Vegas
house price appreciation rates will rise by roughly 6%pt.”

macroeconomic conditions and the fact that potential second house buyers in San Francisco are
more likely to buy a in Las Vegas than Cleveland.
A common ﬁrst response to this speciﬁcation is: “Of course! The 10%pt increase in demand from
the bigger city should have a larger price impact. Isn’t this tautological?” No. It is not, though
the logic is subtle. Imagine two groups of potential second house buyers living in Los Angeles
and Milwaukee respectively that are each thinking about buying into Phoenix, and suppose that
there are 10 times as many potential buyers living in Los Angeles, 10000, as there are living in
Milwaukee, 1000. First, consider the null hypothesis, h0 , that a common shock to the fundamental
value of owning a second house in Phoenix is both attracting out-of-town second house buyers and
driving up prices. In this world, potential second house buyers in both Los Angeles and Milwaukee
see the same shock (the shock to fundamentals), and will always increase their demand by 10%pt
at the exact same time. As a result, Phoenix will always see aggregate out-of-town second house
buyer demand shocks of either 1100 buyers or none at all. Here is the punchline. Under the null
hypothesis, the relative sizes of Los Angeles and Milwaukee are irrelevant. It doesn’t matter how
out-of-town second house buyers are distributed across the country because they are responding
to a common Phoenix-speciﬁc shock. Now, consider the alternative hypothesis, hA , that shocks
to fundamentals in Phoenix are not the only thing attracting out-of-town second house buyers. For
instance, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel might have run a glowing review of Phoenix as a winter
getaway, or Home and Garden Television might have played a Phoenix-based episode of Flip That
House in Los Angeles cable market. In this world, potential second house buyers in Los Angeles
and Milwaukee will not in general see the same shocks. As a result, Phoenix may see a 1000 buyer
demand shock from Los Angeles in one month and then a 100 buyer demand shock from Milwaukee
in the next. It’s only in this alternative world that the 10%pt increase in demand from the bigger
city has a larger price impact. It’s only in this alternative world that the geographic distribution of
potential second house buyers matters.
We conclude in Section 6 by discussing both the economic magnitudes of out-of-town second house

buyer capital ﬂows as well as the broader applicability of our econometric approach. We add up the
sales prices of the houses purchased by these buyers in each city and compare this value to the city’s
GDP. This calculation builds on the analogy between purchases by out-of-town second house buying
and foreign direct investment. The results are large. In 2004 out-of-town second house buyers spent
in excess of 5% of the GDP of Las Vegas which is on par with the size of foreign direct investment in
many developing countries à la Javorcik (2004). Our econometric approach allows us to identify price
movements that can’t be solely explained by shocks to fundamentals. Importantly, it completely
sidesteps the thorny problem of instrumenting for misinformed speculator demand across assets. It
applies wherever there is market segmentation and data on ﬂows between segments.
This paper primarily builds on 3 strands of the ﬁnance literature. First, there is a recent string of
real estate ﬁnance papers studying second house buyers. Bayer, Geissler, and Roberts (2011) analyze
the behavior of second house buyers in Los Angeles who buy and sell small numbers of houses and try
unsuccessfully to time the market. These authors ﬁnd that speculator trading behavior is strongly
associated with neighborhood price instability. Haughwout, Lee, Tracy, and van der Klaauw (2011)
examine credit report data and show that mortgages on second houses represented nearly half of
all mortgages originated in the 4 states with the highest price appreciation rates at the peak of the
market. Li and Gao (2012) present theoretical results that second house buyers can fuel a boom as
well as empirical evidence showing that second house buyers are both more likely to be present in
cities with high house price appreciation and also more likely to subsequently default at higher rates.
The results in these papers are complimentary to ours in that all of these papers document the large
growth in second house purchases in the highest appreciating cities; however, none of the existing
papers is able to directly address the issue of reverse causality. This argument involving reverse
causality is commonly referred to as the Friedman Critique and dates to Friedman (1953). Note
that buying a second house is just one way of speculating in the housing market. e.g., Choi, Hong,
and Scheinkman (2013) show that owner occupants likely over-invested in home improvements.
Second, our work extends the analysis above to diﬀerentiate between local second house buyers
and out-of-town second house buyers. Importantly, we ﬁnd that only the purchases of the latter
group lead to mispricing. Thus, this paper connects to the existing work on the relationship between
distance and investment performance. Within the context of the real estate market Kurlat and
Stroebel (2014) give a theoretical model of markets with many heterogeneous assets and diﬀerentially
informed agents. However, this eﬀect applies more broadly. e.g., Cohen, Frazzini, and Malloy (2010)
study eﬀect of a sell side equity analyst’s social network on her ability to gather information. They
ﬁnd that analysts who are more distant from a ﬁrm in terms of having gone to school with fewer of
the senior management team underperform their peers. In a similar vein, Hong, Kubik, and Stein
(2005) gives evidence that mutual fund managers are more likely to buy a particular stock if other
managers in the same city are buying it as well.
Third and ﬁnally, all of these papers are couched in a broader behavioral ﬁnance literature on
price formation and noise traders. Beginning with the work of Black (1986) and De Long, Shleifer,
Summers, and Waldmann (1991), many authors have conjectured that the trading behavior of
misinformed speculators can cause prices to deviate from their fundamentals. According to these
models other traders may not be able to restore equilibrium because of limits to arbitrage such

as capital constraints, informational frictions, or a limited supply of tradable shares. See Shleifer
and Vishny (1997), Scheinkman and Xiong (2003), and Ofek and Richardson (2003) respectively
for examples. The interaction of traders who are not fully rational and constrained arbitrageurs
can explain common asset pricing puzzles such as momentum—e.g., see Hong and Stein (1999).
The residential housing market is a natural laboratory for studying behavioral ﬁnance questions
about the motivations of traders as the data have additional variables that extend the reach most
ﬁnancial datasets. e.g., in the stock market traders are generally anonymous. By comparison,
housing markets oﬀer a wealth of information about traders via deeds records, mortgage records,
tax rolls, etc. . .
2. Data Description
To perform our analysis, we use data drawn from three main sources: county deeds records
obtained from Dataquick and an anonymous data provider, HPI data from Zillow, Inc. and IAR
data computed according to the procedure developed in Himmelberg, Mayer, and Sinai (2005).
Subsections 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 describe each of these data sources and present summary statistics. Once
cleaned, our data represents 21 MSAs indexed by i = 1, 2, . . . , I over the time period t = 1, 2, . . . , T
with t = 1 denoting January 2000 and t = T denoting December 2007.
2.1. Transaction Level Deeds Records. We use transactions-level deeds records to classify single
family house purchases as made by either owner occupants, local second house buyers, or out-oftown second house buyers. A deed is a written legal instrument that passes the rights to a particular
property (in our case a single family house) from one owner to the next. The deeds records are
public in most states due to information disclosure acts and are maintained by the local county.
Deeds records document any time a property is sold or a new mortgage is taken out by an owner
using the property as collateral. Together, these data contain a complete sales history of any parcel
of land. Below, we deﬁne variables denoting the number of sales in an MSA in a given month.
Deﬁnition 1 (Sales). Deﬁne Xi,t as the annualized number of single family houses sold in MSA i
at month t in units of houses per year.
One advantage of using the US residential real estate market to study asset pricing questions is
that we can obtain information on all buyers and sellers via county deeds records. Namely, for each

Table 1 gives an example of an owner occupant, a local second house buyer, and an out-of-town
second house buyer in our data. In the mid 2000s, the number of purchases by out-of-town second
house buyers in MSAs like Las Vegas, Miami, and Phoenix grew appreciably relative to their level
at the beginning and end of our sample period. Table 2 which gives summary statistics for the
number of out-of-town second house purchases in each MSA i as a fraction of the total number
of sales in MSA i each month. At peak, out-of-town second house purchases always represented
a minority of house purchases. In the most extreme market, Las Vegas, out-of-town second house
buyers purchased 17% of all sales in 2004, up from roughly 7% in the early 2000s. Many of these
MSA speciﬁc sparkline plots display a similar hump-shaped pattern in the number of out-of-town
second house purchases as a fraction of sales. A key insight for our analysis is that the scale of
the patterns diﬀers by orders of magnitude. For example, while both Miami and Milwaukee show
similar percent change rises in the fraction of all houses bought by out-of-town second house buyers
from 2002 to 2006, at the peak of the housing boom Miami had around 3 times as large a fraction

of purchases made by out-of-town second house buyers as Milwaukee.
Research on the role of second house buyers in the housing market typically treats local and
out-of-town second house buyers in the same way. However, as demonstrated in Table 3, purchases
by local second house buyers exhibit a very diﬀerent time series pattern than that of out-of-town
second house buyers. The overall share of purchases by local second house buyers varies much less
across markets compared to the variability in house price appreciation. As well, in most cases (Las
Vegas is an appreciable exception), the share of local second house buyers does not exhibit a hump
with a peak at or near the peak of house prices.
2.2. House Price Appreciation Rate. We use house price appreciation rate data to measure the
price impact of out-of-town second house buyer demand shocks. We obtain monthly house price
index (HPI) data from Zillow, Inc. at the MSA level. Zillow data are available for a larger number of
locations than the S&P/Case and Shiller index data and use a methodology that potentially makes
the index less sensitive to changes in the mix of properties that sell at a given point in time. The
Zillow indexes behave quite similarly to the S&P/Case and Shiller indexes during the boom, but
show less of a sharp decline in 2007.

Table 5. IAR appreciation rate in each MSA i from month t to month t + 12 in units of %/yr
over the time interval from January 2000 to December 2007. The shaded region in the sparkline
plots covers the interquartile range for each MSA and is not a constant scale. Reads: “Over the
entire sample period, implied-to-actual rent ratios in Phoenix grew by an average of 0.205% per year;
however, this growth rate jumped to 36.6% per year in 2004.”

Deﬁnition 5 (House Price Appreciation Rate). Deﬁne Δ log Pi,t→(t+τ ) = log Pi,t+τ − log Pi,t as the
house price appreciation rate in MSA i at month t in units of 1/τ mo, where Pi,t is the HPI index
level normalized to be unity in a base year.
Table 4 gives summary statistics for the house price appreciation rate in units of percent per year.
A number of the markets saw annual house price appreciation rates above 20% per year, with house
price appreciation rates exceeding 35% per year in Las Vegas and Phoenix near the peak of their
booms. What’s more, the sparkline plots show that the timing of these peaks varied substantially
from MSA to MSA with the house price appreciation rate peak in Las Vegas arriving more than a
year prior to the peak in Phoenix. As documented in Ferreira and Gyourko (2011) the recent boom
began at diﬀerent times in diﬀerent MSAs, and house prices exhibited diﬀerent appreciation rates
across these markets. Even the start dates of the subsequent decline in prices diﬀered by a year or
more.
2.3. Implied-to-Actual Rent Ratio Appreciation Rate. In order to make statements about
mispricing, we must pick a pricing model. We use IAR appreciation rate data suggested by the user
cost model to measure the impact of out-of-town second house buyer demand shocks on mispricing.

Table 6. Data sources and short descriptions of the input variables used to compute the user cost
of housing in Himmelberg, Mayer, and Sinai (2005). All variables have units of 1/yr except for the
federal marginal tax rate, κi,t , which is a fraction. All variables reﬂect rates over the time interval
t to t + 12 and are known at time t.

Beginning with Poterba (1984), many authors have priced residential real estate by comparing the
price of a house to the present value of its stream of rental payments, taking into account the
favorable tax treatment given to owner occupied properties and mortgage interest payments. This
pricing strategy is similar to the dividend discount model for the stock market. We refer to models
that price housing along this margin as user cost models.
Unlike the stock market where analysts have actual dividends and share prices, in the housing
market it is quite unusual to have matched data on the sale price and rental rate over the next year
for a particular house. Himmelberg, Mayer, and Sinai (2005) suggest a methodology that allows us
to create an index of mispricing by comparing the ratio of the imputed rent level to the actual rent
level, where the imputed rent is calculated by multiplying the user cost times the price of an owner
occupied house. We use the user cost of housing data from Himmelberg, Mayer, and Sinai (2005)
updated through December 2007. Table 6 gives the data sources and a set of short descriptions for
the input variables used to compute the user cost of housing in Equation (1).
Deﬁnition 6 (User Cost of Housing). Deﬁne Ui,t→(t+12) as the user cost of housing in MSA i in
month t which reﬂects the fraction of the price of a house that an owner must pay in order to live
in that house over the next year from time t to time t + 12:

Ui,t→(t+12) = ρt + ωi,t − κi,t · {μt + ωi,t } + δ − E Δ log Pi,t→(t+12) + π

where the user cost of housing has units of 1/yr.
In the standard user cost model, the price of a house in an MSA i at month t multiplied by the
prevailing user cost of housing should equal the rental rate over the next year, or Pi,t · Ui,t→(t+12) =
Ri,t→(t+12) . REIS collects monthly estimates of the annualized rent for a 2-bedroom apartment.

in MSA i at month t which reﬂects the annual rent payment required to live in 2-bedroom apartment
in MSA i from month t to t + 12 in units of 1/yr.
The log IAR can be thought of as the excess return over the apartment rental rate of a trading
strategy whereby an agent borrows money at rate ρt per year to buy a house, lives in the house
for a year while paying a constant proportion of the house value in depreciation costs δ per year
and earning the tax shield κi,t on his debt payments of (μt + ωi,t ) per year and then sells the house


after one year getting capital gains at the expected price appreciation rate of E Δ log Pi,t→(t+12)
per year while enduring a constant risk premium of π per year. Himmelberg, Mayer, and Sinai
(2005), do not allow the risk premium or leverage to change over time. Thus the computation can
be thought of as a long-run measure of the relative price of owning versus renting, abstracting from
important short-run considerations like easy and cheap leverage in the mid 2000s and time varying
risk premia. When the IAR in a given metropolitan area exceeds unity, owning a house is more
expensive than renting relative to the average value over the sample period.
Deﬁnition 8 (Implied-to-Actual Rent Ratio (IAR) Appreciation Rate). Zi,t denotes the IAR in
MSA i at month t reﬂecting the ratio of the cost to a potential owner of borrowing money, purchasing
a house and then selling it in 1 year to the cost at which he can rent a comparable property for the
same amount of time:

The IAR is scaled to equal 1 relative to the average value of the ratio from January 1980 to December
2007. Δ log Zi,t→(t+τ ) = log Zi,t+τ − log Zi,t denotes the IAR appreciation rate in units of 1/τ mo.
The IAR is computed using HPI data from both the Federal Housing Finance Administration and
Zillow since the Zillow house price indexes are not available prior to 1996. Table 5 gives summary
statistics for the annual IAR appreciation rates. This measure of mispricing varies substantially
across markets such as Phoenix and Denver, respectively. At the peak in Phoenix, a tenant renting
an apartment for $1000 per month would have to pay $1658 per month in mortgage payments and
other costs in order to buy an equivalent house and live in it from January 2004 to December 2004.
By comparison, in Denver, this ratio was 1.267 between 2004 and 2006, so a tenant would have
paid about $1267 per month to purchase a house that rented for $1000 per month and live in it
from January 2004 to December 2004. While houses in Denver were still priced at a small premium
relative to renting at the peak of the national boom, they appeared much less overpriced than houses
in Phoenix at the same time.
Researchers have critiqued the user cost approach in a number of ways. For example, Glaeser
and Gyourko (2007) point out that very few single family houses are rented, so any rental index
is not assured to match up with the price index. Also, the user cost model as estimated above is
inherently static, so it cannot easily incorporate time varying factors like risk premia, the expected
growth rates of house prices, mean-reverting interest rates, credit constraints, and mobility. Glaeser,

MISINFORMED SPECULATORS AND MISPRICING

13

Gottlieb, and Gyourko (2010) gives a model that attempts to correct the simple user cost model for
some of these time-varying features. Mayer (2010) provides a discussion of the pros and cons of the
user cost model as well as a collection of alternative measures of mispricing in the housing market.
Nevertheless, a simple analysis of the user cost model suggests it is well-suited for the purposes
of our paper in that it allows us to estimate a single index value that proxies for mispricing that
accounts for the fact that dividend streams earned by house buyers systematically vary due to
factors such as tax treatment and prevailing interest rates. Comparing house prices to variables
like employment and income has no ﬁrm theoretical prediction and fails to account for changes in
economic fundamentals like interest rates and variable land supply across locations. Comparing
house prices to construction costs only works in markets where land has very low value and thus
is in abundant supply relative to demand. Even in locations with low land prices, house prices
should still equal the present value of rents. By analogy, note that in equity markets there are
circumstances where shares of the same stock confer diﬀerent dividend streams and a user cost-like
model is warranted. i.e., shares with voting rights command a higher price to dividend ratio than
shares of the same stock without voting rights as documented in Zingales (1995).
Finally, Table 2 in Hubbard and Mayer (2009) estimates a log-linearized version of the user cost
model in levels:
log Pi,t = αi + κt + β · log Ri,t→(t+12) + γ · log Ui,t→(t+12) + εi,t

(3)

over the time interval from January 1980 to December 2007 with both MSA and year ﬁxed eﬀects.
The authors ﬁnd coeﬃcients of γ = 0.93 and β = −0.75, which are very close to the values of 1.0
and −1.0 respectively as predicted by the static user cost model. Thus, even though it has many
imperfections, the user cost appears to provide a simple benchmark for what housing prices might
be in a long-term equilibrium. In all of the speciﬁcations below, we repeat our analysis with both
house price and IAR appreciation rates and report both sets of coeﬃcients. The ﬁndings are quite
similar for both measures. As well, all of our results involving IAR appreciation rates are robust
to computing this measure with a variety of diﬀerent assumptions about the expected future house
price appreciation rate.
3. Misinformed Speculators
This section gives evidence that out-of-town second house buyers behaved like misinformed speculators. In Subsection 3.1, we show that out-of-town second house buyers are less informed about
local market conditions relative to local second house buyers and owner occupants. Out-of-town
second house buyers earned lower capital gains on their purchases in MSAs such as Las Vegas,
Phoenix, and Miami relative to local second house buyers who were better able to time the market.
Of course, returns are composed of both capital gains and dividends. In Subsection 3.2, we then
argue that out-of-town second house buyers are less able to consume the dividends generated by
their housing purchase. Finally, in Subsection 3.3 we address concerns that out-of-town second
house buyers might have diﬀerent motivations for making their purchase than local second house
buyers or owner occupants. For instance, they might be extremely wealthy or have a demand for
portfolio diversiﬁcation. We show that these concerns don’t appear to be consistent with our data.

ALEX CHINCO AND CHRIS MAYER

Out-of-town second house buyers look very much like average home buyers except for the fact that
they’ve decided to treat housing as a ﬁnancial asset and make a speculative bet.
In summary, we view local second house buyers as agents who are often engaging in a similar
trade as out-of-town second house buyers, but who are better informed about future house price
appreciation rates. To be clear, there are a variety of diﬀerences between the two groups. For
instance, out-of-town second house buyers are more likely to live in their second house part time,
while local second house buyers are more likely to rent out their house as a source of income.
However, after acknowledging these diﬀerences, the fact remains that both groups of traders are less
able to consume the dividend stream from their second house purchase relative to owner occupants
and thus both groups are more reliant on capital gains to earn positive returns on their investments.
Thus, we think of local second house buyers as a somewhat comparable “control group” of traders
who are more informed than out-of-town second house buyers.
3.1. Informational Disadvantage. Out-of-town second house buyers are uninformed relative to
local second house buyers or owner occupants. By deﬁnition, out-of-town second house buyers
live farther away from the houses they have purchased than local second house buyers and owner
occupants. Thus, these traders don’t “know the neighborhood” as well as local buyers. In addition,
out-of-town second house buyers face a diﬃcult principal agent problem when dealing with local
real estate agents who are paid on commission. Levitt and Syverson (2008) ﬁnd that real estate
agents have substantial discretion in the timing and pricing of house sales with brokers receiving
about 3.7% more than other local owner occupants when selling their own houses. Out-of-town
second house buyers with higher monitoring costs likely face an even larger distortion.
As more direct evidence, we show that out-of-town second house buyers are less successful in
timing their exit from the market when compared to local second house buyers. Figure 3 shows
the average realized capital gains on single family house purchases made by local and out-of-town
second house buyers in MSA i in each month t in units of percent per year. We compute this
capital gain by taking the weighted average of the annualized house price appreciation rates earned
by all second house buyers who purchased a property in MSA i in month t and then resold it in
month t + τ for τ ∈ [1, τ̄ ], where τ̄ represents the number of months between December 2007 and t
where our data are right censored. We assign observations that are right censored the house price
appreciation rate from t to the end date (t + τ̄ ) = December 2008. The width of the out-of-town
second house buyers line is scaled to represent the number of out-of-town second house purchases
in MSA i in month t.
In key markets such as Las Vegas, Phoenix, Miami and Tampa, out-of-town second house buyers
earned lower capital gains on their investments relative to local second house buyers. For instance,
out-of-town second houes buyers purchasing in Las Vegas in March 2004 earned an 8% per year
capital gain on average; whereas, local second house buyers purchasing in the same month earned
a 17% per year capital gain on average. In addition, the average capital gain on out-of-town second

who bought near the peak of the housing boom in Las Vegas. These patterns exist only for “boom”
markets and are either absent or reversed in other markets such as San Francisco or Cleveland which
traditionally have either very cyclical or very ﬂat house price appreciation rates.
Since both out-of-town and local second house buyers bought their houses at the same time in
Figure 3, the diﬀerences in capital gains earned by each group of traders must stem from diﬀerences
in exit timing. Put diﬀerently, the ﬁgure suggests that local second house buyers in markets such
as Las Vegas, Phoenix, Miami and Tampa were better able to time the market downturn than outof-town second house buyers. To quantify this intuition, we estimate the regression speciﬁcation in
Equation (4) which captures the extent to which out-of-town and local second house buyers were
able to recognize the most appropriate time to sell their house prior to the crash. In particular, we
estimate the probability that a second house buyer “ﬂips” their house within 6 months as a function
of (a) the buyer type, (b) whether house prices have hit their peak, (c) the extent to which house
prices are rising or falling in the upcoming year, and (d) the interaction of these terms:

If local second house buyers are better informed about future house price appreciation rates, then
this knowledge should be revealed in their resale timing. These buyers should be more likely to exit
the each market immediately before the house price appreciation rate begins to collapse. Naïvely,
we might expect that more informed traders would always ﬂip at a higher rate over the interval
(t − 6) → t when house price appreciation rates are lower over the interval from t → (t + 12).
However, quickly reselling a house is diﬃcult when house prices are collapsing. Thus, this naïve
estimate of a β % response to a 1%pt per year increase in the house price appreciation rate in MSA
i from t → (t + 12) is a weighted average of the decline in the ﬂipping rate in order to earn the
capital gains and the increase in the ﬂipping rate due to market liquidity. To disentangle these two
oﬀsetting eﬀects, we interact the house price appreciation rate in MSA i from month t → (t + 12)
with a dummy variable 1PostPeak
∈ {0, 1} which is 1 if the house price appreciation rate in MSA
i,t
i peaked in months (t − 6) → t and house price appreciation rates in MSA i reached at least 20%
per year to ensure we are not identifying small local peaks, but rather the culmination of a large
increase in prices.
Table 7 displays the estimated regression coeﬃcients from Equation (4). In all of our regression
speciﬁcations with both time and group ﬁxed eﬀects, we report unclustered standard errors as well
as standard errors clustered at along both the time and group dimensions. Reporting each of these
three values allows both veriﬁes the robustness of the coeﬃcient estimates and also allows readers
to diagnose potential problems with the speciﬁcation as suggested in Petersen (2009). First, we see
that out-of-town second house buyers are 5% less likely than local second house buyers to resell their
house within 6 months over the entire sample. Next, we ﬁnd that while local second house buyers are

Table 7. Estimated coeﬃcients and standard errors from Equation (4). Resale within 6 months is
deﬁned as one if a house purchase in month t − 6 in MSA i resells during the interval (t − 6, t].
Future house price appreciation rate is the house price appreciation rate in MSA i over the interval
from t → (t + 12) in units of percent per year. Post peak is a dummy variable which is 1 if the house
price appreciation rate in MSA i peaked in months (t − 6, t] and MSA i’s house price appreciation
rate peak reached 20% per year or more. The regression uses monthly data from July 2000 to June
2008 on all house sales to local and out-of-town second house purchases the 21 MSAs weighted by
the number of second house purchases in each MSA in each month. Fixed eﬀect estimates of αi , α̂i ,
κt and κ̂t are omitted for clarity. Standard errors are estimated three diﬀerent ways to account for
clustering over time and clustering across MSAs respectively.

4.3% more likely to ﬂip their house purchase within the 6 months immediately following the peak in
local house price appreciation rates, out-of-town second house buyers are only 4.3 − 3.1 = 1.2% more
likely to ﬂip their house purchase during this key interval. What’s more, a t-test reveals that the
point estimate for out-of-town second house buyers is not statistically diﬀerent from zero, suggesting
that the likelihood of ﬂipping is nearly unchanged for out-of-town second house buyers immediately
after a house price peak. Finally, while local second house buyers are more likely to ﬂip a purchase
when prices are rising rapidly during the subsequent 12 months, this eﬀect disappears immediately
following the peak in house price appreciation rates further suggesting that local second house buyers
are strategically changing their behavior in order to time the market. On the other hand, while outof-town second house buyers tend to ﬂip houses more often when house prices are declining during
the entire sample, this eﬀect disappears immediately following the peak in house price appreciation
rates. Taken together, the evidence presented in Table 7 suggests that out-of-town second house
buyers are not using insights about future house price appreciation rates to strategically exit their
investments in the local housing market to the same extent as local speculators.
3.2. Dividend Consumption. Returns are composed of both capital gains and dividends. We
now argue that out-of-town second house buyers are less able to consume the dividends generated
by their housing purchase. There are a number of reasons someone might want to buy a second
house in a diﬀerent city: a buyer might want to live in the house for part of the year, rent the
property out as an additional source of income, or renovate the house and sell it for a proﬁt at
sometime in the future. According to a 2005 survey conducted by the National Association of

18

ALEX CHINCO AND CHRIS MAYER

Realtors,1 31% of second house buyers in 2004 planned to use their house as a vacation home, while
the remaining 69% of second house buyers planned to use their house as a rental property. In each of
these instances, an out-of-town second house buyer gets lower dividends from the purchased house
than a local second house buyer or an owner occupant.
We ﬁrst examine out-of-town second house buyers who use the house only for weekends, holidays,
or vacations. Part time residents can only consume the dividend (e.g., live in the house) for the
portion of each year that they live in the house and thus get lower use than an owner occupant.
Next, consider out-of-town second house buyers who wish to rent out their purchase. Out-of-town
second house buyers face potentially higher costs of property maintenance, renovation, and rental
management. It is costly and diﬃcult to supervise contractors or maintenance people from far away.
As a proxy for the full opportunity cost, note that a typical property manager charges a fee of one
months rent plus an additional 8% of the annual rent each year to lease a house and manage relations
with the tenant. Direct costs to maintain and pay for repairs to appliances and the house itself are
extra. To put these ﬁgures in perspective, imagine you decided to purchase a $200k house in Las
Vegas (the median price in 2004) with a 20% downpayment (the median downpayment for out-oftown second house buyers in 2004) in order to rent it out for $1000 per month (the median rental
price for 2 bedroom houses in Las Vegas in 2004). Over the course of the next 2 years the monthly
property management fees would amount to 7% of your initial $40k investment. This is a non-trivial
drag on your returns, and even assumes that you would be able to immediately rent out your second
house purchase and keep a tenant for all 24 months. To make matters worse, any second house
buyer (both local and out-of-town) wishing to rent out their property faces the prospect of higher
physical depreciation costs as rental tenants may treat the house relatively poorly as compared
to owner occupants as noted in Harding, Miceli, and Sirmans (2000). Finally, out-of-town second
house buyers who plan on renovating a house and selling it for a proﬁt do not live in the property
and are thus almost entirely motivated by future capital gains as pointed out in Bayer, Geissler,
and Roberts (2011).
3.3. Preference Heterogeneity. Even if out-of-town second house buyers are both less informed
and less able to consume the dividend from their purchase than local second house buyers, they
would not be misinformed speculators if they had completely diﬀerent motivations for making their
purchases. For example, a recent New York Times article on the marriage market in China2 reported
that “70% of single women said they would tie the knot only with a prospective husband who owned
a home.” Obviously, we wouldn’t want to classify Chinese bachelors as misinformed speculators if
we found that they were willing to overpay for housing and tended not to live in their purchase
until married. There doesn’t appear to be any such explanation four out-of-town second house
purchases in the US residential housing market. An out-of-town second house buyer in our data
looks very much like an average home buyer except for the fact that she’s decided to treat housing
as a ﬁnancial asset and make a speculative bet.
In this subsection, we consider 3 diﬀerent motivations. First, you might be concerned that the
bulk of out-of-town second house buyers that we study are simply rich occupants in coastal cities.

Figure 4. Median primary residence house price for the populations of out-of-town second house
buyers and of all buyers living in San Francisco in units of $100k over the time period from January
2000 to December 2007. The price of the primary residences of out-of-town second house buyers
living in San Francisco is computed by scaling up the most recent sale price by the Zillow ZIP code
level price index. Reads: “In January 2005, the median value of all single family houses purchased
in San Francisco was $600k. By contrast, the median value of the primary residences of out-oftown second house buyers who live in San Francisco and bought a second house in another MSA in
January 2005 was only $555k.”

Perhaps, they are simply getting lots of utility from owning a vacation house in the Phoenix or
a weekend getaway in Miami. The data do not appear to be consistent with this hypothesis.
For example, Figure 4 shows that the typical out-of-town second house buyer is not a very rich
household. We examine the price of the house that is the primary residence of out-of-town second
house buyers in the highest income cities including San Francisco, San Jose, and New York. In
January 2005, the median value of all single family houses purchased in San Francisco was $600k.
By contrast, the median value of primary residences of out-of-town second house buyers who live in
San Francisco and bought a second house in another MSA in January 2005 was only $555k. While
the value of their primary residence is not a complete characterization of out-of-town second house
buyers’ wealth, this evidence suggests that the super-rich are not the only traders buying second
houses in other cities.
Second, perhaps out-of-town second house buyers are just soon-to-be retirees looking to buy a
house to retire in? For instance, a 2004 Money Magazine article3 writes that “every 8 seconds, a
boomer turns 50. . . so if you’re thinking about retiring in a new home—whether it’s your only base
or one of two—now’s the time to ﬁnd it. ‘There’s a concern that the prices of properties most
desired by boomers may get out of reach,’ says David Hehman, CEO of EscapeHomes.com, a San
Francisco realty ﬁrm specializing in second homes. . . Our advice: Buy now, retire later.” Do we
really want to call Nana a misinformed speculator? In a word: Yes. There is no rule saying that
misinformed speculators can’t sport bifocals and wear scratchy sweaters. If you replace the word
“properties” with “tech stocks” the article may well have been written 4 years earlier. Baby boomers
that bought a second house in Phoenix or Las Vegas with the goal of waiting a few years and then
retiring there made a calculated bet on future house prices and certainly didn’t consume the full
dividend from their housing purchase while still employed.
Third and ﬁnally, perhaps out-of-town second house buyers are interested in the diversiﬁcation

ALEX CHINCO AND CHRIS MAYER

beneﬁts of owning a second house in a market where returns are less correlated with other assets in
the portfolio. i.e., Lustig and Van Nieuwerburgh (2005) give empirical evidence of a housing capital
risk premia due to the covariance of its returns with the returns to the household’s human capital.
Nevertheless, diversiﬁcation can’t be the main motivation for out-of-town second house buyers in
our sample because out-of-town second house buyers tended to own several houses in MSAs with
highly correlated price dynamics. We calculate that the typical out-of-town second house buyer
who owned an investment property in Los Angeles in January 2006 owned 2.1 houses in addition to
his primary residence—i.e., his primary residence, the second house in Los Angeles that he bought
in January 2006, and 1 additional house that he bought in previous months.
It’s even hard to see how out-of-town second house buyers who only bought 1 additional house
could have been motivated primarily by diversiﬁcation beneﬁts. e.g., imagine you are a home owner
living in Los Angeles, and you are considering investing $40k as a downpayment on a second house
in Phoenix. If you don’t make this purchase, you will realize utility over the next year of:
γ
(5)
UDon’t Invest = E [ ΔPLA + DLA ] − · Var [ ΔPLA + DLA ]
2
where ΔPLA denotes the dollar house price appreciation in Los Angeles, and DLA denotes the housing
dividend paid out by your primary residence in Los Angeles. If you decide to purchase the second
house in Phoenix, you will realize a utility over the next year of:
UInvest = E [ (ΔPLA + DLA ) + ({ΔPPhx − κ} + {DPhx − λ}) ] − $40k
(6)
γ
· Var [ (ΔPLA + DLA ) + ({ΔPPhx − κ} + {DPhx − λ}) ]
−
2
where ΔPPhx denotes the dollar house price appreciation in Phoenix, κ denotes the wedge between
the house price appreciation rates earned by out-of-town and local buyers, DPhx denotes the housing
dividend paid out by the second house in Phoenix, and λ denotes the dividend loss due to being an
out-of-town buyer. Subsection 3.1 suggests that on a $200k house the dollar house price appreciation
wedge would be about κ = 0.09 × $200k = $18k at peak. Subsection 3.2 suggests that the dividend
drag of being an out-of-town owner would be around λ = $2k in the ﬁrst year of ownership. Thus,
in order for the second house purchase in Phoenix to make sense for you, it has to be the case that:
$20k < − γ · ρLA,Phx · σLA · σPhx

(7)

2
since there is an active residential housing market in
after setting $40k = μPhx + DPhx − γ2 · σPhx
Phoenix. On a $500k primary residence in Los Angeles, the yearly standard deviation in dollar
price appreciation over the time period from 1996 to 2011 is σLA = $60k. On a $200k second house
in Phoenix, the yearly standard deviation in dollar price appreciation over the same time period is
σPhx = $30k. Thus, for a risk aversion coeﬃcient γ = 2, there just needs to be a really weak negative
correlation of −0.01 between dollar house price appreciation in Los Angeles and Phoenix for the
second house in Phoenix to be a good investment. Here is the punchline: the actual correlation
is extremely positive at ρLA,Phx = 0.81! Buying a second house in Phoenix just isn’t a good hedge
against house price ﬂuctuations in Los Angeles.
Diversiﬁcation beneﬁts surely play some role in determining macro-level house price dynamics.
However, the previous 2 paragraphs suggest they are unlikely to be key factors governing the choices

of out-of-town second house buyers. This can’t be what’s driving out-of-town second house buyer
demand.
4. Predictive Regressions
In this section, we show that increases in out-of-town second house buyer demand predict increases
in future house price and IAR appreciation rates; whereas, increases in local second house buyer
demand are not associated with increases in either of these measures. Subsection 4.1 details the
house price appreciation rate results, and Subsection 4.2 outlines the IAR appreciation rate results.
Of course, in order to make statements about mispricing, we must pick a pricing model. In this
paper we subscribe to the user-cost model and use deviations of city-wide log IAR ratios from zero
as a proxy for mispricing. The higher the log IAR ratio is, the cheaper it is to rent rather than
buy, and the higher the level of mispricing on the rent-vs-own margin. One of the main criticisms
of this model is that expected house price appreciation rates are an input. To mitigate this concern
we show that our empirical results do not depend on the gritty details of how this expectation is
calculated by rerunning the resulting using a moving average calculation.
4.1. House Price Appreciation Rate Regressions. We estimate a panel VAR characterizing
the relationship between the house price appreciation rate in an MSA i from month t to t+1 and the
numbers of local and out-of-town second house purchases as a percent of sales in MSA i in month t
using a panel data set indexed by MSA and month. The state vector Yi,t contains the house price
appreciation rate from month (t − 1) → t in MSA i as well as the fraction of all house purchases in
MSA i in month t that were made by out-of-town and local second house buyers respectively:
Yi,t = Δ log Pi,(t−1)→t

The omitted category is the fraction of sales made by owner occupants. Using this state vector, we
study the regression speciﬁed in Equation (9) below:
Ei,t = (I − ΘL1 ) (Yi,t − Ai − Kt )

(9)

In this representation, I denotes a 3 × 3 identity matrix, Θ denotes the 3 × 3 transition matrix, L1
denotes the 1 month lag operator, Ai and Kt denote 3 × 1 vectors of MSA and month speciﬁc ﬁxed
eﬀects and Ei,t denotes a 3 × 1 vector of error terms.
We report the point estimates and standard errors for the elements of the Θ transition matrix
in Table 8. Panel (a) of Table 8 reveals that a 10%pt increase in the number of out-of-town second
house purchases as a fraction of all purchases in an MSA i in month t is associated with a 0.21%pt
increase in the house price appreciation rate in the subsequent month. To get a better sense of the
size of this relationship at the yearly horizon in the presence of the other variables, we compute the
cumulative change in the house price appreciation in Las Vegas in response to a 10%pt increase in
the fraction of purchases made by out-of-town second house buyers as was experienced during the
mid 2000s. We plot this impulse response function in Figure 2 above and calculate that this one
time 10%pt increase corresponds to a 6%pt per year increase in the annual house price appreciation
rate or roughly 1/5th the realized 30%pt jump in the annual house price appreciation rate in Las
Vegas during the boom.

Table 8. Parameter values and standard errors of the transition matrix Θ speciﬁed in Equation
(9) estimated using three panel regressions on monthly data for the 21 MSAs from February 2000
to December 2007 using N = 1995 observations. Fixed eﬀect estimates of Ai and Kt are omitted
for clarity. Standard errors are estimated three diﬀerent ways to account for clustering over time or
across MSAs. Reads: “A 10%pt increase in the number of out-of-town second house purchases as a
percent of all purchases in Los Angeles in April is associated with a 0.21%pt increase in the house
price appreciation rate in Los Angeles in May.”

This estimate is likely biased downward for 2 reasons. First, the impulse response calculation only
considers a one time shock whose eﬀect peaks out at around the 6 month horizon as Figure 2 shows.
However, MSAs such as Las Vegas realized sustained increases in the fraction of all sales made by
out-of-town second house buyers that lasted for upwards of 2 years. Second, group ﬁxed eﬀects tend
to explain absorb too much variation in panel VARs with short time series as suggested in Nickell
(1981). For intuition, recall that in ﬁnite samples principle component analysis over-estimates the
size of the ﬁrst principle component and leaves too little variation to be explained by subsequent
factors. Similarly, by picking the group ﬁxed eﬀects that best explain the average level of the group,
panel VARs on data with a short time series dimension tend to assign too much of the variation
across groups to the group ﬁxed eﬀects Ai and leave too little to be explained by the transition
matrix Θ.
Note that while an increase in the fraction of purchase made by out-of-town second house buyers
predicts and increase in house price appreciation rates over the next year, an increase in the fraction
of purchases made by local second house buyers has a negative but statistically insigniﬁcant eﬀect.
Thus, it is clear that not all second house buyers have the same price impact in this market. Some
speculators were created more equal than others.

4.2. IAR Appreciation Rate Regressions. The results in the previous subsection suggest that
an increase in the fraction of purchases made by out-of-town second house buyers in a given month
predicts an increase in the house price appreciation rate in the subsequent month. However, large
price movements do not necessarily indicate mispricing; instead, these movements in price could be
due to ﬂuctuations in housing market fundamentals. In order to address this concern, we augment
our analysis with a similarly speciﬁed panel VAR regression using the monthly IAR appreciation
rate rather than the monthly house price appreciation rate:

Comparing Panel (a) in Tables 8 and 9 reveals that the predictive power of an increase in the
percent of all purchases made by out-of-town second house buyers is even larger when examining
IAR appreciation rates rather than house price appreciation rates. e.g., a 10%pt increase in the
number of out-of-town second house purchases as a percent of all purchases in an MSA i in month
t is associated with a 0.73%pt increase in the IAR appreciation rate in the subsequent month. This
evidence suggests that out-of-town second house buyer demand shocks appreciably distort the own

Figure 5. Response of IAR appreciation rates, out-of-town second house buyer demand, and local
second house buyer demand both to (red, solid) a 10%pt increase in the fraction of sales made to
out-of-town second house buyers in Las Vegas as well as to (blue, dashed) no shock. We compute the
ﬁgure using the panel VAR in Equation (9) whose point estimates calculated over the time period
from January 2000 to December 2007 are housed in Table 8. Reads: “In the 12 months following a
10%pt increase in the percent of purchases made by out-of-town second house buyers in Las Vegas,
IAR appreciation rates will rise by roughly 9%pt.”

vs. rent calculus of people living in the target MSA. As before, we ﬁnd very little evidence that an
increase in purchases by local second house buyers aﬀects mispricing. The predictive power of an
increase in the fraction of purchases made by these local speculators is a tightly estimated zero in
Table 9.
Computing the impulse response to the same 10%pt increase in the percent of purchases made by
out-of-town second house buyers on IAR rather than house price appreciation rates in Las Vegas
as shown in Figure 5 reveals that this shock again explains around 1/5th the increase in mispricing
in Las Vegas. This estimate remains relatively unchanged even though the point estimates on the
lagged out-of-town second house buyer percent in Table 9 are much larger than those in 9 because
IAR appreciation rates are substantially less predictable than the house price appreciation rates.
The autoregressive coeﬃcient falls from 0.864 in Table 8 to 0.438 in Table 9, while the adjusted R2
drops from 0.75 to only 0.26. As further evidence, note that the peak eﬀect of the 10%pt shock in
Figure 5 occurs at 3 months rather than at 6 months in the house price appreciation rate calculation
in Figure 2. Switching from house price appreciation rates to IAR appreciation rates leaves the point
estimates in Panels (b) and (c) of Table 9 nearly unchanged as compared to Table 8 which gives a
check on the stability of the estimation procedure. Moreover, Table 10 shows that our results are
not dependent upon the precise way that the expected price appreciation is computed in the IAR
appreciation rate calculation. It shows that a 10%pt increase in the number of out-of-town second
house purchases as a fraction of all purchases in Los Angeles in April is associated with a 0.33%pt
increase in the IAR appreciation rate in Los Angeles in May even when using 5 year moving average
for the expected price appreciation in the user cost calculation.

with higher house price and IAR appreciation rates in subsequent months. This section investigates the obvious follow up question: “Are these associations causal?” Using a novel econometric
approach, we show that out-of-town second house buyer demand cannot be entirely explained by
changes in fundamentals. Subsection 5.1 outlines our identiﬁcation strategy. The crucial insight is
that an increase in the fundamental value of owning a second house in Phoenix represents a common
shock to the investment opportunity set of all potential second house buyers. Thus, if changes to
fundamentals were driving both price dynamics as well as out-of-town second house buyer demand,
we would expect to see large jumps in house price and IAR appreciation rates preceded by increases
in out-of-town second house buyer demand from across the country. Subsection 5.2 then shows
that the data do not display this symmetric response. As a result, they are inconsistent with an
explanation based on reverse causality. To test this prediction econometrically, we condition our
regressions on city size. For instance, we ﬁnd that a 10%pt increase in demand for second houses
in Phoenix by buyers living in Los Angeles predicts a bigger increase in Phoenix house price and
IAR appreciation rates than a 10%pt increase in demand by buyers living in Milwaukee. We include

26

month and ordered city pair ﬁxed eﬀects in our speciﬁcation to account for variation in macroeconomic conditions and the fact that potential second house buyers in San Francisco are more likely to
buy a in Las Vegas than Cleveland. Finally, in Subsection 5.3, we consider additional speciﬁcations
to investigate the robustness of the main results.

5.1. Empirical Predictions. Consider a short example to cement the intuition behind our identiﬁcation strategy. Appendix A gives a fully ﬂedged economic model. Consider 2 groups of people
living in Los Angeles and Milwaukee respectively that are each thinking about buying a second
house in Phoenix. For the purposes of this example, suppose that there are roughly 10 times as
many potential second house buyers living in Los Angeles, 10000, as there are living in Milwaukee,
1000. First, consider the null hypothesis, h0 , that a common shock to the fundamental value of
owning a second house in Phoenix is both attracting out-of-town second house buyers and driving
up prices. In this world, potential second house buyers in both Los Angeles and Milwaukee see the
same shock (the shock to fundamentals), and will always increase their demand by 10%pt at the
exact same time. As a result, Phoenix will always see aggregate out-of-town second house buyer
demand shocks of either 1100 buyers or none at all. Here is the key observation. Under the null
hypothesis, the relative sizes of Los Angeles and Milwaukee are irrelevant. Because out-of-town
second house buyers are responding to a common Phoenix-speciﬁc shock it doesn’t matter how
they are distributed across the country. Now, consider the alternative hypothesis, hA , that shocks
to fundamentals in Phoenix are not the only thing attracting out-of-town second house buyers. For
instance, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel might have run a glowing review of Phoenix as a winter
getaway, or Home and Garden Television might have played a Phoenix-based episode of Flip That
House in Los Angeles cable market. In this world, potential second house buyers in Los Angeles
and Milwaukee will not in general see the same shocks. As a result, Phoenix may see a 1000 buyer
demand shock from Los Angeles in one month and then a 100 buyer demand shock from Milwaukee
in the next. It’s only in this alternative world that the 10%pt increase in demand from the bigger
city has a larger price impact. It’s only in this alternative world that the geographic distribution of
potential second house buyers matters.
To implement this identiﬁcation strategy, we need to calculate both the number of potential
out-of-town second house buyers living in each MSA i in every month t as well as the time varying
demand per out-of-town second house buyer in MSA i for second houses in MSA j at month t.
Deﬁnition 9 (Number of Out-of-Town Second House Buyers). Let Qi denote the number of potential
out-of-town second house buyers in MSA i measured as the average annualized number of second
house purchases made by buyers living in MSA i each month over the period from January 2000 to
December 2007 so that T = 96:

θi→j,t =

Si→j,t

(12)

where θi→j,t has units of houses per trader.

Using these variables, we estimate Equation (13), which studies the relationship between the
house price appreciation rate from time t to time t + 1 and the proportion of second house buyers
in each MSA i that purchase an out-of-town second house in MSA j at time t represented by the
coeﬃcient γ on the variable θi→j,t :
Δ log Pj,t→(t+1) = β · Δ log Pj,(t−1)→t + γ · θi→j,t + αi→j + κt + εi→j,t ,

i = j

(13)

The ordered MSA pair dummy variables control for two key eﬀects as displayed in Equation (14)
below:
αi→j = ᾱj − γ · E[θi→j,t ]

(14)

First, each αi→j accounts for the mean house price appreciation rate ᾱj in each MSA j over the
sample period (or the mean IAR appreciation rate over the same time period). Second, each αi→j
adjusts the predicted house price appreciation rate (or IAR appreciation rate) in MSA j for the
average rate at which second house buyers living in MSA i purchase second houses in MSA j. For
instance, γ ·E[θ(SFO,j),t ] diﬀerentially controls for the tendency of potential out-of-town second house
buyers living in San Francisco to purchase more houses in Phoenix than in Milwaukee:
E[θ(SFO,PHX),t ] = E[θ(PHX,SFO),t ] = E[θ(SFO,MIL),t ]

(15)

We estimate all regression equations in this section using a panel dataset at a monthly frequency
from February 2000 to December 2007 on the 21 × 20 = 420 ordered MSA pairs with all i = j
pairs removed. Observations from January 2000 are removed due to the missing 1 month lagged
values yielding a balanced panel of 39900 observations. We also consider the speciﬁcation outlined
in Equation (13) replacing the house price appreciation rate in MSA j from time t to time t + 1 with
the IAR appreciation rate from time t to t + 1. Consistent with the results in Section 4, we expect
to estimate a positive γ for both speciﬁcations indicating that, for instance, IAR appreciation rates
rise by γ %pt per month in MSA j when the proportion of second house buyers in MSA i = j that
invest in MSA j increases by 1%pt.
Next, we augment this baseline speciﬁcation in order to investigate the null hypothesis that second
house buyers in all MSAs i ∈ {I \ j} proportionally increase their demand for houses in MSA j after
appropriate controls. We do this by including an interaction between the number of second house
buyers in MSA i and the proportion of these speculators buying houses in MSA j. Speciﬁcally,
we deﬁne the three indicator variables below which divide the set of 21 MSAs in our sample into
terciles based on the number of second house buyers where 1Sml
denotes one of the 7 MSAs with

Med
the fewest potential out-of-town second house buyers, 1i

What will the coeﬃcients from Equation (16) tell us? First, if the null hypothesis h0 that a
common shock to the fundamental value of owning a second house in Phoenix is both attracting
out-of-town second house buyers and driving up prices is true, then we should ﬁnd δMed = δLrg = 0.
i.e., a 1%pt increase in the demand per potential buyer living in Los Angeles (a large market) for
second houses in Phoenix should be equally predictive of an increase in house price appreciation
rates in Phoenix as a 1%pt increase in the demand per potential buyer living in Milwaukee (a small
market). Next, if the alternative hypothesis hA that shocks to fundamentals in Phoenix are not the
only thing attracting out-of-town second house buyers is true, then we should ﬁnd δLrg > δMed > 0.
i.e., that the geographic distribution of potential second house buyers matters. House price and IAR
appreciation rates are higher in Phoenix following a demand shock from Los Angeles as opposed to
a demand shock from Milwaukee.

All regressions use monthly data from February 2000 to December 2007 on the 420 ordered MSA pairs
with all i = j pairs removed. Fixed eﬀect estimates of αi→j and κt are omitted for clarity. Standard errors are estimated three diﬀerent ways to account for clustering over time or across ordered
MSA pairs. Reads: “A 10%pt increase in the fraction of out-of-town second house buyers buying into
Phoenix in January 2005 is associated with a 7.69%pt increase in monthly IAR appreciation rates
in Phoenix in February 2005. This impact jumps to 11.77%pt if the out-of-town second house buyer
choice shock happens in Los Angeles (a large MSA) and falls to 3.56%pt if the out-of-town second
house buyer choice shock happens in Milwaukee (a small MSA).”

5.2. Estimation Results. The evidence presented in Tables 11 and 12 strongly rejects the null
hypothesis, h0 , that common shocks to the fundamental value of owning a second house in, say,
Phoenix are both attracting out-of-town second house buyers and driving up prices. The tables show
that the geographic distribution of potential second house buyers matters in both a statistically
measurable as well as an economically meaningful way. Consistent with our alternative hypothesis,
hA , unobserved shocks to fundamentals cannot fully explain the behavior of out-of-town second
house buyers.
Panel (a) in both Table 11 and Table 12 reports the estimated coeﬃcients and standard errors
from Equation (13) using both price and IAR appreciation rates as the dependent variable and
indicates that an increase in the fraction of potential out-of-town second house buyers investing
in an MSA has a positive and statistically signiﬁcant eﬀect. The point estimate for in Table 11
implies that a 10%pt increase in the fraction of out-of-town second house buyers purchasing a house
in, say, Las Vegas predicts a 2.13%pt increase in the monthly house price appreciation rate in Las
Vegas. Similarly, in Table 12, a 10%pt increase in the fraction of out-of-town second house buyers
purchasing a house in Las Vegas predicts a 7.69%pt increase in the IAR appreciation rate in the
subsequent month. i.e., when more out-of-town second house buyers pile into a city, renting begins

30

ALEX CHINCO AND CHRIS MAYER

to look like a more and more attractive option in the subsequent months.
Next, looking at Panel (b) in both Tables 11 and 12 we see that the coeﬃcient δLrg in both
Equation (16) is statistically diﬀerent from zero. The impact on house price appreciation rates of
a 10%pt increase in the fraction of potential out-of-town second house buyers living in a large MSA
(e.g., Los Angeles) and investing in, say, Phoenix is almost twice as large as that of a 10%pt increase in
the fraction of potential out-of-town second house buyers living in a small MSA (e.g., Milwaukee).
As well, the ordering of the interaction terms is consistent with the alternative hypothesis that
demand from distant speculators causes house price and IAR appreciation rates to increase. In all
speciﬁcations δLrg ≥ δMed ≥ 0. Panel (b) of Table 11 reads that while a 10%pt increase in January
2004 in the fraction of potential out-of-town second house buyers living in Milwaukee and investing
in Phoenix predicts an 0.52%pt increase in the monthly house price appreciation rate in February
2004, that same 10%pt increase in the fraction of potential out-of-town second house buyers living
in los Angeles and investing in Phoenix predicts a 0.52 + 3.18 = 3.70%pt increase in the monthly
house price appreciation rate in Phoenix in February 2004.
5.3. Robustness Checks. In this subsection, we discuss possible ways that the regression speciﬁed
in Equation (16) might lead to spurious conclusions and then describe how we address these issues.
First, while the baseline speciﬁcation assumes that the house price and IAR appreciation rates in
all MSAs realize a common shock κt in each month, macroeconomic forces during our sample period
likely aﬀected potential out-of-town second house buyers living in diﬀerent MSAs in diﬀerent ways.
For example, potential buyers living in New York might always have more accurate beliefs about the
fundamental value of owning a second house than potential buyers living in Milwaukee. In Table
13 we re-run the speciﬁcations using home MSA by month rather than simply month ﬁxed eﬀects
to account for this concern as shown below:
Δ log Pj,t→(t+1) = αj + κi,t + β · Δ log Pj,(t−1)→t + γ · θi→j,t
+ δMed · 1Med
· θi→j,t + δLrg · 1Lrg
· θi→j,t + εi→j,t
i
i

i = j

(17)

where the κi,t terms capture the time varying eﬀect of shocks to diﬀerent out-of-town second house
buyer home MSAs. We ﬁnd that the previous results are qualitatively unaﬀected by including home
MSA by month ﬁxed eﬀect. e.g., after controlling for the average level of out-of-town second house
buying by traders living in Los Angeles and Milwaukee each month, it is still true that a 10%pt
increase in the fraction of out-of-town second house buyers buying into Phoenix in January 2005
is associated with a 1.47%pt increase in monthly house price appreciation rates in February if the
buyer choice shock occurs in Los Angeles (a big MSA) but only a 0.28%pt increase if the buyer choice
shock happens in Milwaukee (a small MSA).
This result means that out-of-town second house buyer demand is a fundamentally networked
phenomenon. Any explanation must suggest particular pairs of cities at particular times. Any story
that is speciﬁc to a particular city or a special date just doesn’t cut it. e.g., in order to confound
our results, potential second house buyers in Los Angeles must get diﬀerentially better information
about the fundamental value of housing in Phoenix than potential second house buyers living in
Milwaukee in an extremely precise way: (a) traders living in Los Angeles would need to receive
extremely good information about buying a second house in Phoenix only during the period from

a 1.47%pt increase in monthly house price appreciation rates in February if the buyer choice shock
occurs in Los Angeles (a big MSA) but only a 0.28%pt increase if the buyer choice shock happens in
Milwaukee (a small MSA).”

2004 through 2006 when Phoenix realized its highest house price appreciation rates, and (b) this
information could only have applied to Phoenix and not to other cities that traders in Los Angeles
might have invested in. Thus, while a time-varying ordered city pair correlation between both house
price and IAR appreciation rates and out-of-town second house buyer shares would confound our
results, it is diﬃcult to think of such an explanation.
Second, perhaps the size of potential out-of-town second house buyers’ belief distortions are
random variables that move over time. In such a world, covariance between the home MSA size
and the size of potential out-of-town second house buyers’ belief distortion may bias our results. To
address this concern, in Table 14 we again re-run our analysis, only this time we instead compute
the number of potential out-of-town second house buyers living in each MSA using the ranking in

By contrast, the ﬁrst deﬁnition of the number of potential second house buyers in each MSA i
represents the sample average over the entire period from January 2000 to December 2007. Since
this variable is computed using the entire time series, it is potentially simultaneously determined
with investment opportunities in the largest markets for out-of-town second house buyers that
appear attractive later in the sample period. e.g., some out-of-town second house buyers might only
have entered the housing market because MSAs like Las Vegas and Phoenix appeared to have had
great investment opportunities. This observation motivates the use of the second deﬁnition that
includes only data from the year 2000 which predates the rapid rise in house price appreciation rates
in all MSAs and minimizes the possibility for correlation between home MSA size and the level of

belief distortion.
The results in Table 14 are a bit less robust than those in Tables 11 and 12 with the interaction
terms having smaller coeﬃcients, but present a consistent story. In all cases, the coeﬃcients on the
interaction of out-of-town second house buyer share and large MSAs is statistically diﬀerent from
zero no matter which clustering of standard errors we use. When ranking MSAs according to their
potential out-of-town second house buyer populations in 2000, a 10%pt increase in the fraction of
out-of-town second house buyers buying into Phoenix in January 2005 is associated with a 2.11%pt
increase in monthly house price appreciation rates in February if the buyer choice shock occurs in
Los Angeles (a big MSA) but only a 0.69%pt increase if the buyer choice shock happens in Milwaukee
(a small MSA). In Table 14, the coeﬃcient on the interaction with medium size cities is negative, but
is not statistically diﬀerent from zero. Finally, we observe that the empirical results are strongest
in Panel (b) where we use the IAR appreciation rate as the dependent variable. To the extent that
the IAR appreciation rate proxies for mispricing, these results present a consistent picture that
out-of-town second house buyers contribute to mispricing.
6. Conclusion
We use transactions-level deeds records to show that out-of-town second house buyers behaved
like misinformed speculators and drove up both house price and IAR appreciation rates. First, we
give evidence that out-of-town second house buyers behaved like misinformed speculators relative
to local second house buyers. Out-of-town buyers had poorer exit timing and were also less capable
of consuming the dividend from their purchase. Second, we demonstrate that increases in outof-town second house buyer demand predict increases in future house price and IAR appreciation
rates. Speciﬁcally, a 10%pt increase in the fraction of sales made to out-of-town second house
buyers is associated with a 6% increase in house price appreciation rates and a 9% increase in
IAR appreciation rates. Third and ﬁnally, we confront the issue of reverse causality using a new
econometric approach. Our central insight is that an increase in the fundamental value of owning a
second house in Phoenix is a common shock to the investment opportunity set of potential second
house buyers living everywhere. Thus, if it were the case that changes to fundamentals were driving
both price dynamics as well as out-of-town second house buyer demand, then we should see large
jumps in house price and IAR appreciation rates preceded by increases in out-of-town second house
buyer demand from everywhere. The data do not display this symmetric response.
We conclude by discussing both the economic magnitudes of out-of-town second house buyer
capital ﬂows and the broader applicability of our econometric approach. First, to get a sense of the
magnitudes, we examine how total out-of-town second house buyer purchases compare to the size
of the local economy. Figure 7 plots the sum of the sales prices on out-of-town second house buyer
purchases as a percent of MSA-speciﬁc gross domestic product from 2000 to 2007. The MSA-speciﬁc
GDP data comes from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. These calculations treat all purchases as
being net new capital coming from outside the MSA, whether ﬁnanced by debt or equity since
the majority of debt ﬁnancing came via selling residential mortgage-backed securities. This ﬁgure
shows that the sum of the sales prices in Las Vegas exceeded 5% of Las Vegas’s GDP in 2004. Thus,
demand shocks from out-of-town second house buyers appear to be quite substantial when compared

to the aggregate economic output of many MSA-level economies. As points of comparison, Barro
and Ursúa (2008) deﬁne a 10% drop in the GDP of a country as an economic disaster, and Javorcik
(2004) examines ﬁrm-level data in Lithuania and ﬁnds that foreign direct investment from the US
on the order of 3.4% of the Lithuanian GDP in 2000 leads to substantial spillover eﬀects in its real
economy. Building on this analogy to FDI, we see an opportunity in future work to study the impact
of these spillovers from the residential housing market on local economies.
Second, we emphasize that our econometric approach allows us to identify price movements
that can’t be solely explained by shocks to fundamentals. To our knowledge, this approach which
completely sidesteps the thorny problem of instrumenting for misinformed speculator demand across
assets is new to the ﬁnance and economics literature. The identiﬁcation strategy applies wherever
there is a) market segmentation and b) data on ﬂows between segments. We conjecture that distant
demand driven mispricings may not be a phenomenon conﬁned to the US residential real estate
market. For instance, Oﬃce for National Statistics (2007) found that 1.8Mil households in England
owned a second home and, among these properties, 87k were in Spain and being used as part
time residences during the peak of the Spanish housing boom. To give some idea of the scale of
this investment expenditure by overseas second home buyers in Spain, in Figure 6 we plot the net
foreign direct investment (henceforth, FDI) in Spain as a percent of Spain’s GDP from 2003 to 2010
using data from the World Bank alongside the real HPI level in Spain over this same time period.
We ﬁnd that FDI as a percent of GDP spikes to just under 5% in 2008, a similar percentage to
the total of outside purchases of homes in Las Vegas at peak, and that the timing of this spike
corresponds to the peak of the HPI level. Data do not show a similar peak in FDI in other southern
European counties. Similar events unfolded in the US commercial real estate market in the late
1980s when a 1986 tax code change made purchases of commercial real estate less attractive for US
companies and invited a host of foreign investors from countries like Japan to large scale purchases
of commercial oﬃce buildings. See Sagalyn (1999), which discuss the purchase of Rockefeller Center
by Mitsubishi Trust, Co. for more than $1Bil in the late 1980. Thus, distant speculators may be an
important class of traders playing a role in mispricing more generally and an interesting topic of
future research.

Appendix A. A Simple Model of Speculation
In this section we develop a simple noisy rational expectations model of the US residential housing
market to clarify our identiﬁcation strategy and better interpret our empirical results. We begin
in Subsection A.1 by outlining the basic economic framework. Then, in Subsection A.2 we study
the pricing implications in two alternative regimes. The ﬁrst regime admits only fully informed
traders while the second allows for misinformed traders as well. In Subsection A.3, we interpet our
econometric analysis through the lens of the model.

A.1. Economic Framework. Consider a static housing market with I ≥ 1 MSAs. The price of
a house in MSA i is Pi and the true value of a house in MSA i is Vi where both Pi and Vi are
measured in dollars per house. We model the true value of housing in each MSA i as an iid random
iid
variable drawn from a normal distribution Vi ∼ N(μv , σv2 ). There are Qi traders in each MSA i
indexed by q = 1, 2, . . . , Qi . Let ϑq,i→j denote the number of houses in MSA j demanded by the
q th trader in MSA i and let Si→j denote the total number of houses in MSA j demanded by traders
in MSA i. We denote the average demand for houses in MSA j by traders living in MSA i as
 i
θi→j = 1/Qi · Q
q=1 ϑq,i→j and can interpret this quantity as the probability that a randomly selected
trader in MSA i buys a house in MSA j. Total demand for housing in MSA j, denoted Xj , is
deﬁned as the sum of the housing demand from each MSA i plus an MSA speciﬁc demand shock εj :

(19)
Xj =

i=1

q=1

i=1

where εj is an iid draw from a normal distribution εj ∼ N(0, σε2 ) and Xj has units of houses.
There is a collection of market makers who operate under perfect competition. These agents only
observe the aggregate demand Xj in each MSA and as a result of perfect competition set the price
level equal to the expected value of housing in MSA j given the realized aggregate demand:
Pj = E [Vj |Xj ] = α + β · Xj

(20)

The coeﬃcient β can be interpreted as the dollar change in the price of housing in MSA j when
traders demand one additional unit of housing in MSA j. Market makers might be developers or
property managers who either build new housing units to match demand or reclaim unused housing
units by turning them into rental properties or razing them to build oﬃce or industrial space.
Traders in each MSA i know the true value of housing in every other MSA j. For instance, in
this view of the world a trader living in San Francisco that purchases a second house in Las Vegas
knows the true value of housing in Las Vegas. The competitive market makers assume that traders
use a linear demand rule given by:
ϑq,i→j = γq,i→j + δq,i→j · Vj

(21)

This is the standard ansatz for Kyle (1985) type models and can easily be veriﬁed in equilibrium.
The coeﬃcient γq,i→j has units of houses per trader and the coeﬃcient δq,i→j has units of houses
per trader dollar. Each individual trader optimizes their value function Wq,i by choosing how many

parameters {(γq,i→j

trader’s optimization problem in Equation (22).
(2) Given all traders follow the demand rules speciﬁed in Equation (21), the price parameters
(α∗ , β ∗ ) satisfy the expectations equality in Equation (20).
A.2. Equilibrium Housing Prices. First, we solve for the equilibrium in this economy when all
traders are fully informed. This equilibrium is identical to the standard Kyle (1985) equilibrium

in all aspects except for the fact that each trader represents only 1/ Ii =1 Qi of the total market
demand. Thus parameters deﬁning the number of houses demanded per trader θi→j as well as
the price impact of each trader’s demand decisions (γi→j , δi→j ) are both deﬂated by a factor of
1/I Qi .
i =1
Proposition 1 (Fully Informed Equilibrium). When traders in all markets have correct beliefs about
the true value of housing Vj in MSA j, traders in all MSAs demand the same number of houses in
MSA j:
θ̄j = θ1→j = θ2→j = · · · = θI→j

(23)

Proof. Substituting both the functional form for the housing price in MSA j from Equation (20)
and the functional form for the aggregate demand in MSA j from Equation (19) into the objective
function for an individual trader q from MSA i yields an expression:
Wq,i→j = max E [(Vj − α − β · Xj ) · ϑq,i→j |Vj ]

(27)

This expression would be identical for any trader q living in MSA i ∈ I implying that θi→j = θi →j
for all i, i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , I}.

The key implication of this framework is that, in a world where all traders are fully informed,
the proportion of traders from MSA i investing in MSA j is the same for each i = 1, 2, . . . , I. i.e.,
variation in the housing demand in MSA j per person in MSA i is proportional to variation in the
value of housing in MSA j as ﬂuctuations in Vj represent a common shock. While full information is
perhaps the most natural benchmark, note that the symmetry in Proposition 1 still holds if traders
are not fully informed but instead similarly misinformed. For instance, if potential second house
buyers in every MSA all over-valued housing in Phoenix by 10%, then traders in all MSAs would
still demand the same number of houses in Phoenix—this common demand per trader would just
be too high.
Next, we solve for an equilibrium when traders in some MSA i are misinformed about the value
of housing in MSA j. Speciﬁcally, suppose that traders in MSA i believe that the value of a house
in MSA j is Ṽj = Vj + η dollars with η > 0 rather than the true value of Vj dollars assuming that
(i)
traders in MSA i think that all other traders share the same beliefs. Let P̃j denote the price of
housing in MSA j when traders from MSA i have overconﬁdent beliefs about Vj .
Proposition 2 (Price Distortion). Suppose that misinformed traders in MSA i believe that the value
of housing in MSA j is Ṽj = Vj + η with η > 0. Then the price of a house in MSA j will be distorted
by an amount proportional to the number of traders in MSA i:

will adopt the same pricing rule as in Proposition 1. What’s more, both traders with correct beliefs

This proposition is easiest to interpret via a short numerical example. Suppose that there are
55 × 106 traders split across 10 MSAs with the largest MSA i containing 10 × 106 traders and the
smallest MSA i containing only 1 × 106 traders. Then, the price increase in MSA j when traders
from MSA i or i alternately believe that housing values in MSA j are Ṽj = Vj + $5000 are:

In other words, when misinformed traders from a larger market attempt to purchase investment
properties, they have a bigger impact on prices than misinformed traders from a smaller market.
A.3. Empirical Strategy. The goal of this simple model is to provide a scaﬀolding within which
to better understand the empirical strategy we employ. First, we identify a group of misinformed
speculators. Within the model, this task corresponds to identifying a group of traders who are likely
to have misinformed beliefs about future price levels, i.e. an η > 0. In Section 3 we give evidence that
out-of-town second house buyers satisfy this criteria. Second, we show that an increase in demand
from out-of-town second house buyers predicts increases in house price and IAR appreciation rates.
Within the model, this task is tantamount to checking if housing appears overpriced—i.e., that
Pj /E[Pj ] > 1 or log Pj − log E[Pj ] > 0 after taking logs—when out-of-town second house buyers
have above average demand. While the model is cast in levels, in the empirical implementation we
study log Pj,t − log Pj,t−1 in place of log Pj − log E[Pj ] under the assumption that E[Pj ] = Pj,t−1 .
Finally, we address the issue of reverse causality. Within the model, this task corresponds to
checking whether or not high realized prices in MSA j are due to high realized housing values Vj or to
some group of traders in MSA i having misinformed beliefs η > 0. We exploit the natural geographic
segmentation in the housing market to address this challenge. Proposition 1 demonstrates that if
an increase in the price of housing in MSA j is due to an unobserved (from the point of view of
an econometrician) increase in house values, then out-of-town second house buyers from each other
MSA should increase their demand for housing in MSA j in equal proportions. In Section 5 we
test for this symmetry and show it to be violated. From this evidence, we conclude that out-oftown second house buyers are not simply responding to unobserved information when making their
purchases. In Proposition 2 we show that if out-of-town second house buyers from MSA i have a
belief distortion η about the value of housing in MSA j, then the size of the resulting price distortion
should be proportional to the share of traders residing in MSA i. We ﬁnd exactly this pattern in
the data; the correlation between the house price and IAR appreciation rates and the share of
out-of-town second house buyers going from MSA i to MSA j is bigger when the total number of
out-of-town second house buyers living in MSA i is larger. We interpret these results as evidence
that MSA speciﬁc variation in out-of-town second house buyer beliefs about MSA j (perhaps due
to local news sources or word of mouth) is contributing to the realized price distortion.
