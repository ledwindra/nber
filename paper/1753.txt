Taxes and Cbrporate Investnent in Japapnese Manufacturing

ABSTRACP

This paper examines the impact of taxes on the
incentive to invest for the Japanese manufacturing
sector in the postwar period. The idyosyricratic
feature of the Japanese corporation tax system as
compared to the U.S. is the prevelence of tax-free
reserves and the tax deductibility of a part of
taxes paid by corporations in the previous year.
Our formula for the tax-adjusted Q and the cost of
capital incorporates this. The main conclusions are
as follows. While the postulated negative relation
with the cost of capital cannot be found, investment
in Japanese manufacturing shows until 1974 a strong
association with the tax-adjusted Q.
Since the
change in stock prices, not taxes, is the primary
source of changes in Q, the profitability of capital
is the major determinant of investment.

1. Introduction

The rapid output growth in postwar Japan is characterized by

the high level of investment which has for almost all years been

above 30% of the Gross National Product. Economic theory tells

us that investment is governed by the cost and the benefit of
incremental capital stock.

Financial rate of return and taxes

determine the cost of capital, while the benefit is the profit-

ability of capital that depends on market opportunities and
technology.

The contribution of the neoclassical theory of Hall

and Jorgenson (1971)

is that it showed exactly how taxes

influence the cost of capital. whereas the essential feature of
the Q theory of investment is that the determinants of investment

can be summarized by a single index called the tax-adjusted Q
that combines the cost and the benefit of capital. In order to
understand the high level of investment in Japan, it is necessary

to analyze the relative importance of the cost and the profit-

ability of capital and how taxes affect them. The purpose of
this paper is to do precisely that by examining the relation
between investment, the cost of capital, and Q.

The Japanese corporation tax system can potentially exercise

profound impact on the incentive to invest. The Corporation Tax

Law specifies the procedure for calculating taxable income and

the applicable tax rates.

The enterprise tax on corporations

paid in the previous accounting year is tax deductible. The
calculation of taxable income also includes accounting depreciation,

inventory valuation, and a I !owances for

accrued costs that

The plan of the paper is as follows.. Section 2 incorporates

the various aspects of Japanese tax law into a firm's optimization.

Section 3 derives the formula for the cost of capital and

the tax-adjusted Q, and identifies the channels through which
taxes influence investment.

In section 4 we calculate the cost

of capital and the tax-adjusted Q for the Japanese manufacturing

sector as a whole and examine their relationship to investment.
Section 5 is a brief conclusion.

2. Taxes and the Valuation bf a Firm

Our task in this section is to incorporate various aspects
of the Japanese corporation tax system into a standard model of a

firms value maximization problem. The next section will derive
a one-to-one relationship between the investment-capital ratio
and "Q" adjusted for various tax parameters. For the most part,
we will ignore personal taxes and the financial side of the firm.

Modifications of the investment-Q relationship that are necessary

if those factors are considered will be discussed at the end of

the next section.

Thus for the time being we will focus on a

100% equity financed firm whose investment finance comes from

parameters, the notation will be rather complicated. A glossary
of symbols is provided in Table 1.

Consider a firm in period 0 whose objective is to maximize
its market value which is the present value of its net cash flow:

(I) Depreciation

Allowances.

According

to

the financial

statements compiled by corporations with the Ministry of
Finance, virtually all corporations employ either the straight
line method or the declining balance method.
(ii)

Special

Depreciation.

In addition to the ordinary

depreciation, the Special Taxation Measures Law lists asset

types for which additional depreciation for the first year
(and for some assets, several succeeding years) is permitted.

Since the cumulative amount of depreciation is unchanged,
special depreciation amounts to deferred tax payments.

(iii) Investment Tax Credits. Currently, corporations can choose

for certain types of equipments between a special first-year
depreciation of 30% and a tax credit of 7% of the acquisition
cost.

Since the amount of the investment tax credits is

negligible relative to total investment expenditure, we will
ignore it.

(iv) Enterprise Tax.

The amount of enterprise tax paid in the

previous accounting year can be deducted from this year's
income.

As seen below, the deductibility of the enterprise

tax reduces the "effective" corporate rate significantly.

(v) Tax-Free Reserves.

The Corporation Tax Law and the Special

Taxation Measures Law list a host of tax-free reserves that

can be deducted from income. For most reserves the amount
deducted must be added back to the next year's income.

In the

formulation below we assume this is the case for all tax-free
reserves.2

Thus

tax-free reserves, another veicle for

5

corporations to defer tax payments, is essentially a one-year

interest-free loan granted by the government. The variable

that determines the maximum amount to be deducted from
corporate income and credited to the reserve depends on the
reserve.

For

example, for the Reserve for Retirement

Allowance it is the wage bill, and for the Bad Debt Reserve it

is the amount of receivables. We will divide various tax-free

reserves into two groups.
reserves.3

The first is employment-related

The second group consists of reserves whose

maximum allowable deduction is a function of various other

variables pertaining to the firm that, we assume, are a
function of the "size" of the firm, which we take to be the
reproduction cost of the firm.

The expression for the tax payment T that incorporates
these features of Japanese tax law is:

3. The Tax-Adjusted Q and the Cost of Capital

We now derive a one-to-one relationship between investment

and "Q" adjusted for various tax parameters for the valuemaximizing firm. Assuming that the firm is a price-taker, pretax
profits can be written as

(3.1)

lIt =

PtF(KtLt.It)

—

wtLt.

where p is the output price, F is the production function, K is

the capital stock, L is labor input, and w is the wage rate.
Adjustment costs are incorporated here because output is assumed
to be inversely related to investment, i.e., 3F/31 < 0. "Bolting
down1' new machines is a resource-using activity; as the quantity

of investment increases, a larger fraction of capital and labor

has to be directed to the investment activity, which results in
lower output.

As we indicated in the previous section, the tax-free
reserves are divided into employment-related reserves (RL) and

other reserves (RK).

The former depends on the wage bill (wL)

while the latter is a function of the reproduction cost of the
firm (aK):

(3.2)

RK(aK)

it will turn out, it does not matter in the final expressions

the last three terms in the expression (2.4) for the value

The second term is the reduction in wage rate induced by the

substituting it into (3.1), we see that pretax profits are a
function of the real wage w*/p adjusted for tax-free reserves.

there were no adjustment costs, then 3F/31 = 0, so we

aAt(wt/Pt)/aKt -

(aLt/aKt)(wt-wt)/Pt.

This expression for the cost of capital is convenient for
evaluating the overall impact of both types of tax-free reserves
on the incentive to invest.

We now re-introduce adjustment costs.

Noting that the

optimal labor input is a function of w/p and solving (3.5b) for
investment, we obtain the investment-Q relation:

This 9 is referred to as the tax-adjusted Q.

It is the real

value of the gap between the shadow price of capital (A) and the
effective price of investment goods [(1-z')a], grossed up by the

corporate tax rate. We note from (3.15) that optimal investment

depends also on the adjusted real wage t?/p.

It is clear from

the derivation of this optimal investment rule that if the

(3.19)

A-(1-z)a =

£C(t,s) (1_o)5t(1_15)p5(aF5/3K5_c;).

That is, the tax-adjusted Q is essentially the present value of
the gap between the marginal product of capital and the cost of
capital.

Thus, in the model with adjustment costs, the cost of

capital continues to be an important channel through which taxes
influence investment.
As shown in l-Iayashi (1982), the shadow price of capital A in

the expression (3.16) for the tax-adjusted Q can be made

Under this set of assumptions it seems obvious that the iüaximized

value of (3.4) is proportional to the initial capital stock (1-

So the marginal value of capital A0 is equal to the

average value of capital:

Thus the tax-adjusted Q as defined in (3.16) is connected to the
value of the firm. Furthermore, under the homogeneity assumption
the investment-Q relation becomes

(3.22)

It/Nt =

This much is standard. A new result here is that the connection
involves the tax-free reserves and the enterprise tax in the
previous year.

The same homogeneity assumption also permits a

simplification of the expression (3.14) for the cost of capital.

Noting that under the homogeneity assumption aL/aK = L/F( and
using (3.20), we get, for

So the

the firm is the total equity value. How should we modify fl'e
expressions for the tax-adjusted Q and the cost of capita!? The
following results on the investment-Q relation have been obtained

16

in Hayashi

(1985) for a model of a firm with adjustment costs

under uncertainty and personal

taxes: (i) the investment-Q

relation can be derived when at least part of incremental
investment is financed either by retained profits or by new
equity;

(ii)

if new equity are used for investment finance, the

value of the firm in the model is simply the sum of equity and
debt outstanding; (iii) if retained profits are used, the equity

value receives a higher weight than debt, provided that the
capital gains tax rate is lower than the dividend tax rate; and

(iv) when incremental investment is financed entirely by debt,
the investment-Q relation cannot be derived. However, the model

is incapable of explaining why corporations in the real world
simultaneously issue new shares and pay dividends. There does
not seem to be any work that derives the cost of capital as the

determinant of investment for a firm without adjustment costs

under uncertainty and personal taxes.

More specifically, it

remains unclear how the discount rate r t

is related to the

corporate bond rate and the expected equity return.6 With no
completely satisfactory theory about how investment finance

influence the tax-adjusted Q and the cost of capital, we will
continue to use the expressions derived in this section, with V0
(the value of the firm) being the value of equity and debt minus
land and inventories.

17

4. Empirical Results

The impact of taxes on the incentive to invest can be
evaluated by examining how taxes enter the expressions for the
tax-adjusted Q and the cost of capital. Since they involve the
present value of various forms of tax savings, we have to make

assumptions about how future tax rates and discount rates are
anticipated.

For empirical implementation we assume static

expectations about the tax rates (u, v -r) and the discount rate.

Thus a', A' and r can now be written as

The measurement of the tax-adjusted Q and the cost of
capital for the Japanese manufacturing sector as a whole requires

data on: V (market value of equity plus debt minus land arid
inventories). u (corporate tax rate), v (enterprise tax rate), r

(discount rate), A (present value of depreciation allowances on

past investment), R (tax-free reserves), S (enterprise tax), a

(investment goods price), 6 (physical depreciation rate), K
(capital stock), al (nominal investment), a (present value of
depreciation allowances on new investment), p (output price) and
P

(real rate of return).

Two prinàipal data sources are the

Ministry of Finance (various fiscal years) and the Tax Bureau
(various fiscal years).

The former has data on the financial

statements aggregated over all corporations by industries. The
aggregation is done by blowing up the sample aggregates by the
sampling ratio. These data will be referred to as the £11 nçJl

years.

into account.7

and this determined our sample period. The following is a brief

The data on the capital stock is from the

National Wealth Survey. As this survey is done every five years,

the Gross Capital Stock data are used for interpolation. Using
the nominal investment series from the Financial Statements data

and the investment goods price index (to be explained later), I
generated a capital stock series by a perpetual inventory method

with the rate of depreciation of about 9%.

It turned out that

this capital stock series is very close to the above capital

(ii)

The market value of equity is calculated under the

assumption that the ratio of the market value to the book value
for all corporations in manufacturing Is the same as that for all
corporations in manufacturing traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.

In calculating the market value of equity, the average of daily

stock prices over the fiscal year is used. The market value of
long-term debt is obtained by dividing the interest payments by a

long-term interest rate. The market value of short-term debt is

assumed to be the same as the book value. The value of the firm
is the sum of the market value of equity and debt. However, the

stock market valuation of a firm includes the value of land and

inventories, which must be subtracted from the value of equity

plus debt to arrive at the financial valuation of the capital
stock.

A perpetual inventory method is used to calculate the

value of land. The price index for land is the Residential Land
Price Index constructed by the Japan Research Institute of Real

Estates (Nihon Fudosan Kenkyu-Jo). The change in the book value
of land is assumed to be the market value of the change in land.
The market value of land in the base year (1955) is assumed to be
equal

the

assesment given by the Ministry of Local

Administration for the purpose of levying property taxes. The

(1) the share of respective deprec 1 at ion methods and (2)

the breakdown

of nom inal investment into the t hree asset types

(buildings, structures and equipments). The data on (1) is taken
from the financial statements of corporations traded on the Tokyo

Stock Exchange.

Since virtually all corporations employ either

the straight line method (about 20%) or the declining balance

0

method

(80%), only the two depreciation methods are considered.

This share is assumed to be the same for all asset types. The
data on (2) are not available on yearly basis. The breakdown for

1975 (calendar year)

is obtained from the capital formation

matrix in the 1975 Input-Output Table. The breakdown is assumed
to be the same as that in 1975 for all years.

Our construction of the investment goods price index (a) is
as follows. From the capital formation matrix in the 1975 Input-

Output Table, we can obtain the breakdown of nominal investment

by industry source.

We use this breakdown as weights to

calculate the price index as a weighted average of the relevant
components of the Wholesale Price Index. The same weight is used
to calculate the overall depreciation rate (o). The depreciation

rate for individual assets
(198!).

is taken from Hulten and Wykoff

Our estimate of 6 turns out to be 8.99%. We use the

overall Wholesale Price Index for the output price index (p).

Our estimate of u, v, S and R comes from the Tax data. The

corporate tax rate u is the ratio of the national and local
corporation taxes to the taxable income. The enterprise tax rate

v is the ratio of the enterprise tax to the taxable income. The

figure for S is directly available from the Tax data. The
measurement of R (tax-free reserves)

is more problematical.

There are as of 1981 twenty-eight tax-free reserves listed in the

Corporation Tax Law and the Special Taxation Measures Law. Since
corporations may accumulate the reserves above the maximum amount

specified by the tax law without any further tax heneftts, the

23

data on reserves available from the Financial Statements data
cannot be used.

Furthermore, the Financial Statements data do

not report tax-free reserves separately; some of the tax-free
reserves are merged with the amount of special depreciation and

other reserves that are not tax-free. On the other hand, the
data on only six major tax-free reserves from 1963 are available

from the Tax data.

They are: Reserve for Bad Debts, Bonus

Reserve, Reserve for Retirement Allowances, Reserve for Price
Fluctuations, Overseas Market Development Reserve for Small- and

Medium-Sized Enterprises, and Reserve f or Overseas Investment
The amount credited to these reserves (except for the

Losses.

last two, which are minor relative to the rest) must be added
back in full in the following accounting year, as assumed in our

theoretical model. For lack of alternative data sources, we use
the total of these six tax-free reserves for R.

The data thus obtained that are necessary for calculating
the tax—adjusted Q and the cost of capital are gathered in Tables
1

and 2.

The data for 1955 (fiscal year) are not available

because the calculation of Q requires data for the preceding
year.

Table 3 contains the tax-adjusted Q and the cost of

capital along with a couple of variables that summarize the

impact of taxes on the cost of capital. Since no data are
available for R (tax-free reserves) before 1962, our calculation

assumes that the ratio of R to ak (the reproduction cost of
capital) prior to 1963 is the same as that for 1963.

As we can

see by comparing the Q series in Table 3 with the data on the

since our data on P includes only six reserves.

inventory method for about 620 firms for the fiscal years 1965 to
1981.

Although thi s data set consists mainly of individual

financial statements,

there is an item that reports since 1976

the maximum amount to be credited to the Reserve for Retirement

25

Allowances.

This amount is regressed on the capital stock for

each year. Table 4 reports the regression results. Although the
intercept term is significant, the capital stock coefficient is
very close to that in the regression without the intercept.

The data in Table 3 are graphed in Figures 1-6. The
investment-capital ratio, the tax-adjusted 9, the cost of capital

and the tax factor are plotted against time in Figures 1 to 4.
The declining trend in the cost of capital is mainly due to the
decline in the price of investment goods relative to the output
price. The tax rate r is the major reason for changes in the tax
factor. The investment-capital ratio is plotted against the tax-

adjusted 9 in Figure 5.

Until 1974 there is a fairly strong

positive relationship between I/K and 9, but since then the
correlation turns into negative. BY historical standards, 9 in

recent Years is too high in relation to investment.

Two

explanations come into mind for the puzzling behavior of 9 after
1974, both of which rely on the sharp rise in energy prices. The
first is to note that the relationship between I/K and 9 as given

in (3.22) involves real factor prices whose component includes
energy prices. Energy inputs are needed to install new machines

within the firm.

remains

a puzzle.

However, Q looks good if compared with the cost of capital.
The plot of 1/1< against the cost of capital in Figure 6 shows a
positive correlation.

5. Conclusion

While the postulated negative relationship with the cost of
capital does not exist, investment in Japan shows, at least until
1974,

a strong positive association with the tax-adjusted Q.

However, most of the action in Q comes not from taxes but from
stock prices.

As stock prices are a good summary of future

profitability, we may conclude that market opportunities and
technological change have been the major driving force behind the
high invstment level in postwar Japan.

Footnotes

1. For a good description of the Japanese corporation tax system,
see An Outline of Japanese Taxes published by the Printing Bureau
under authorization of the Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance.

2. For a few tax-free reserves, the law permits corporations to
spread the amount to be added back to income over several years.
The tax-free reserves for which the data are available to us are
the types described in the text.

3. The Reserve for Retirement Allowances and the Bonus Reserve
are examples.
In the theoretical model we will assume for such
reserves that the amount creditable to the reserve is a fraction
of the current wage bill and that the amount credited must be

added back in full to the next year's income. However, the
Reserve for Retirement Allowances does not exactly satisfy this
assumption.
According to the law, the amount creditable to this
reserve during the current year is either (i) the difference over
the year in a hypothetical total severance pay that the firm must
pay if all the employees retire now, or (ii) a fraction of the
current total wage bill. Furthermore the amount to be added back
to income is the actual severance pay during the current year.
So if the firm hires a worker, it can deduct from income either

the hypothetical severance pay accruing to the worker or the
fraction of the worker's current salary, and the corresponding
increase in income occurs when the worker actually retires, which
may be several decades from now. Let R be the amount accumulated

in the reserve.

If the firm

chooses U) above, R is the

hypothetical total severance pay. If the firm chooses (ii), the
change in R is the fraction of the current wage bill. Provided
that the present value of the future corresponding increase in
income is negligible, the tax benefit arising from this reserve
comes only from the decrease in current income, which equals the
change in R.
This is equivalent to the assumption in the text
that the firm can deduct from current income the entire amount R

but that the previous year's R must be added back in full to
current income.

4. For the Reserve for Retirement Allowances, R is the amount
that has been accumulated. See footnote 3.

5. That the tax-free reserves influence the cost of capital
through this term was noted in Ikemoto, Tajika and Yui (1984).

6. Auerbach (1979) shows that the discount rate is a weighted
average of the corporate bond rate and the expected equity rate
of return for a case where there are no uncertainties but where
the corporate bond rate is an exogenously given function of the
debt-equity ratio.
