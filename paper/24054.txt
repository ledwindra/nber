Personalized Medicine When Physicians Induce Demand

JEL No. I11,I18
ABSTRACT
Advocates for “personalized medicine” tests claim they can reduce health care spending by
identifying patients unlikely to benefit from costly treatments. But most tests are imperfect, and
so physicians have considerable discretion in how they use the results. We show that when
physicians face incentives to provide a treatment, the introduction of an imperfect prognostic test
will increase treatment rates. We study the interaction of incentives and information in
physicians’ choice between conventional radiotherapy and intensity modulated radiation therapy
(IMRT) for Medicare patients with breast cancer. IMRT is far more costly. Patients with left-side
tumors are more likely to benefit from IMRT, though it is unnecessary for the vast majority of
patients. IMRT use is 18 percentage points higher in freestanding clinics, where physicianowners share in the lucrative fees generated by IMRT, than in hospital-based clinics. Patients
with left-side tumors are more likely to receive IMRT in both types of clinics. However, IMRT
use in patients with right-side tumors (the low benefit group) treated in freestanding clinics is
actually higher than use in patients with left-side tumors (high benefit group) treated in hospitalbased clinics. Prognostic information affects use but does nothing to counter incentives to
overuse IMRT.

Introduction

Advances in genetics and artificial intelligence promise to launch an era of “personalized
medicine.” Diagnostics and algorithms will help doctors distinguish between patients who are
and are not likely to benefit from a treatment. Discussions of the impact of personalized
medicine on treatment patterns and costs often proceed as if physicians will use information in a
socially optimal manner. For example, proponents of personalized medicine claim it will reduce
health care spending (for example, PhRMA 2015; Food and Drug Administration 2013) by
identifying patients unlikely to benefit from costly therapies. However, physicians often face
incentives to provide costly treatments. Further complicating matters, many tests do not
definitively identify patients who will and will not benefit from a treatment. Instead, they provide
another prognostic factor to consider alongside the standard clinical variables (Hunter et al.
2016).
In this paper we consider how physicians’ incentives and information on patients’ ability
to benefit from treatment interact to shape treatment decisions. Using the standard physicianinduced demand model, we show that the introduction of a test that predicts patients’ ability to
benefit from treatment will lead to an increase in the share of patients receiving it. Also,
treatment rates for patients most likely to benefit from treatment will be more responsive to
incentives.
We evaluate the interaction between incentives and patients’ ability to benefit using the
case of intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for breast cancer. Physicians differ in their
incentives, based on whether they practice in a freestanding or hospital-based clinic. Patients
differ in their ability to benefit from IMRT, based on whether the tumor is in the left or right
breast. Patients with left-side tumors are more likely to benefit from IMRT.
A problem with studying the impact of personalized medicine tests on treatment is that
most are not routinely ordered. Thus, it is only possible to observe the impact of test results on
treatment for a selected subsample of patients. In the case of IMRT, physicians observe tumor
laterality for all patients. Tumor laterality is also as good as randomly assigned in terms of being
uncorrelated with education, income, or other factors related to patients’ receipt of advanced
technology. We can study how laterality affects treatment decisions without having to consider
physicians’ initial decision to obtain the information or its relation to other prognostic variables.
2

We find that IMRT use is much higher among women treated at freestanding clinics.
Physicians at freestanding and hospital-based clinics vary their use of IMRT based on tumor
laterality. However, use of IMRT among patients with right-side tumors (low benefit) treated in
freestanding clinics is higher than the use of IMRT among patients with left-side tumors (high
benefit) treated in hospital-based clinics, suggesting that incentives exert a powerful influence on
treatment thresholds in this setting. Also, consistent with theory, differences in the use of IMRT
between patients treated in freestanding and hospital-based clinics are larger, though nonsignificant, for patients with left-side tumors. The implication is that the introduction of
personalized medicine tests will not necessarily reduce costs, and decisionmakers should
evaluate the potential impact and cost savings from personalized medicine tests in light of the
incentives facing the physicians who will act on the information.
In related work, Dinan et al. (2015) report that receipt of the 21-gene recurrence score
assay, a test that predicts breast cancer patients’ ability to benefit from chemotherapy, did not
reduce the use of chemotherapy among breast cancer patients. However, only 10% of the patients
in the sample received the test, making it difficult to independently identify the impact of the test
because the physicians who ordered it may favor a more aggressive treatment approach.

A model of treatment choice

We modify the standard physician-induced demand model to show how allowing
physicians to set different inducement levels for different patient groups affects the overall
inducement rate and how financial incentives influence the relative inducement rates in each
group.
To review, in the standard model physician utility is a function of income and the level of
inducement: u ( y, i ) . Inducement raises income via its impact on the share of patients treated, but
physicians pay a psychic cost for acting against their best assessment of patient and societal
welfare. For simplicity, we assume physicians’ labor supply is fixed. Income is y = rx(i ) , where
r is the reimbursement rate and x(i ) describes how the share of patients treated varies with

inducement. Partial derivatives (McGuire and Pauly 1991) are u y > 0 , u yy < 0 ; ui < 0 , uii < 0 ;
and, xi > 0 , xii = 0 . We assume additive separability: u yi = 0
3

Assume there are two patient types who differ in their ability to benefit from treatment.
The benefits of treatment vary within these groups, and so the disutility of inducing demand
varies within each group. Physicians’ utility for high-benefit types is u H ( y, i ) . Physicians’ utility
for low-benefit types is u L ( y, i ) , where

u H ( y,0) = u L ( y,0)

and the disutility of inducing demand among low-benefit patients is larger (i.e., more negative)
and decreases at a faster rate:

uiL < uiH < 0 ,

uiiL < uiiH < 0 .

Physicians’ marginal utility of income and the relationship between inducement and income,

x(i ) , do not vary by patient type.
If physicians can set different inducement levels for high- and low-benefit patients, the
utility-maximizing inducement level is higher for high-benefit patients: i H ≥ i L . To see this, note
that the utility-maximizing inducement for low-benefit patients is defined by u y xi = −uiL (see
Figure 1). At the utility-maximizing level of inducement for low-benefit patients, the marginal
utility of income exceeds the marginal utility of inducement for high-benefit patients,
u y xi (i L ) = −uiL (i L ) > −u yH (i L ) .

Since physician utility for high-benefit patients is increasing at i L , then i H ≥ i L .

If physicians cannot distinguish between high- and low-benefit patients, they maximize

u H ( y, i ) + 12 u L ( y, i ) , assuming that half of patients are each type. Let i M indicate the level of

inducement that maximizes this sum.
A test that allows physicians to distinguish between high- and low-benefit patients will
cause average inducement levels (and, by extension, the share of patients receiving the
treatment) to rise: 12 i L + 12 i H > i M . To see this, note that i M will fall in the interval between i L and

i H and is defined by
u y xi + uiH = −[u y xi + uiL ] .
5

Since u (⋅) is single-peaked, utility for low-benefit patients (the term in the brackets on the right)
is declining for i > i L and utility for high-benefit patients (the term on the left) is increasing for

i < i H . In the interval between i L and i H physicians’ marginal utility for low-benefit patients
decreases at a faster rate than physicians’ marginal utility for high-benefit patients increases
because uiiL < uiiH < 0 for all i . Therefore, physicians’ marginal utilities for high- and low-benefit
patients must intersect (which defines i M ) at a point in the interval between i L and 12 i L + 12 i H , i.e.

i + 12 i H > i M .

The impact of a change in the reimbursement rate on inducement is ambiguous. If the
income effect is strong enough, an increase in reimbursement rates could lead to a decrease in
inducement. Regardless of whether an increase in the reimbursement rate increases or decreases
inducement, inducement levels for high-benefit patients are more responsive to fee levels (when
physicians can set separate inducement levels). The terms uiiH and uiiL enter positively in the
denominators of the derivatives of i H and i L with respect to the reimbursement rate (see equation
2 in McGuire and Pauly). The denominator will be larger in absolute terms, and the derivative
smaller, for low-benefit patients since uiiL < uiiH .
For the sake of simplicity and tractability, we assumed that physicians’ utility for highbenefit patients does not depend on the inducement rate for low benefit patients and vice versa.
There are two ways in which they may interact. First, the disutility of inducing demand for highbenefit patients may depend on the level of inducement for low-benefit patients. Following
McGuire and Pauly, who model how physicians chose treatment rates when there are two payers,
we assume they are independent. Second, an increase in the inducement level for low benefit
patients will affect income and the marginal benefit of additional inducement for high-benefit
patients via its impact on income. We ignore this second-order effect.

Clinical background

Women with early stage breast cancer are typically offered the choice between
mastectomy and breast conserving surgery (also known as lumpectomy). Following breast
6

conserving surgery, where surgeons remove visible masses of tumor cells, most patients undergo
radiation therapy to kill any remaining cells. Therapy is delivered on an outpatient basis.
Conventional external beam radiation therapy can damage healthy cells near the target site,
leading radiation oncologists to seek methods of delivering radiation that spare the tissue
surrounding the target. Unlike conventional beam radiation, IMRT uses sophisticated treatment
planning software to ensure that the target area receives a consistent, uniform dose while
minimizing the delivery of radiation to nearby tissue. IMRT is commonly used as a primary
therapy for head and neck cancer and prostate cancer.
Randomized trials comparing IMRT to conventional radiotherapy in breast cancer
patients (Mukesh et al. 2013; Pignol et al. 2008) have found that IMRT reduces the rate of
cosmetic side effects and self-limiting skin peeling and irritation. However, there are no
differences in quality of life, tumor recurrence rates, and survival rates. Based on the lack of
evidence that IMRT is associated with clinically significant benefits, the American Society for
Radiation Oncology (2013) recommends against routine use of IMRT in breast cancer patients
following breast conserving surgery: “While IMRT may be of benefit in select cases where the
anatomy is unusual, its routine use has not been demonstrated to provide significant clinical
advantage.” Medicare spending is $6,000 to $8,000 higher for breast cancer patient who receive
IMRT compared to conventional radiotherapy (Roberts et al. 2013; Smith et al. 2011).
Radiotherapy risks damaging the heart. The risk is higher for women with tumors in the
left breast, which is closer to the heart, and the value of IMRT is higher for women with leftsided tumors. Some Medicare claims processors and Medicare Advantage plans include the
following language in their IMRT coverage policies, “Indications will include some left breast
tumors due to risk to immediately adjacent cardiac and pericardial structures, though it would
only rarely if ever be medically necessary for tumors of the right breast.” Even for women with
left-sided tumors, the value of IMRT is questionable for most patients. The increased use of
relatively inexpensive techniques and technologies, like breath-holding or shields, has probably
reduced the exposure of the heart to radiation (Recht 2017).

7

Physicians’ treatment setting

Cancer patients can receive radiotherapy at freestanding clinics, most of which are owned
by the radiation oncologists who practice there, or hospital-based clinics. Hospital-based clinics
may be staffed by employed radiation oncologists or radiation oncologists in independent
groups.
Delivery of IMRT is a complex, multi-step process that includes treatment planning,
physician management, imaging procedures, and treatment delivery. Clinics bill separate Current
Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes for each step. Some are billed only once, others are billed
on a recurring basis. Radiology clinics bill a code for treatment delivery for each session. There
is no professional fee associated with the code, but the facility fee for IMRT treatment delivery
in a freestanding clinic is approximately $500, accounting for a substantial share of the total
revenues associated with IMRT. Medicare sets facility fees to cover average costs, including the
cost of acquiring IMRT equipment. The difference between average and marginal costs may be
especially large for capital-intensive services like IMRT. By comparison, the fee for treatment
delivery of conventional beam radiation therapy is around $100.
Radiation oncologists who have an ownership stake in a freestanding clinic receive a
share of the group’s profits, which are generated by the provision of services like IMRT that
have large facility fees. Radiation oncologists who practice in hospital-based clinics do not. (It
would be illegal under Medicare anti-kickback regulations for hospitals to give them a bonus
based on the facility fees they generate.) For this reason, physicians in freestanding clinics face
extra incentives to provide IMRT compared to physicians in hospital-based clinics.
Previous studies have found that prostate cancer patients treated by urology groups that
acquire IMRT equipment (Bekelman et al. 2013; Carreyrou and Tamman 2010; General
Accounting Office 2013; Mitchell 2013) and breast cancer patients treated in freestanding clinics
are more likely to receive IMRT (Roberts et al. 2013; Smith et al. 2011). In other clinical
settings, a number of studies have shown that when physicians assume ownership stakes in
facilities or equipment, their procedure volume rises (Baker 2010; Barro et al. 2006; Hollenbeck
et al. 2010; Hollingsworth et al. 2010a; 2010b; 2011; Iizuka 2007; 2012; Mitchell 1992; 2005;
2008; 2010l, Nallamothu et al. 2007; Shreibati and Baker 2012). These results suggest that the
incentives inherent in physician ownership affect physicians’ treatment decisions, though there
8

are alternative explanations. Physicians’ responses could reflect the convenience of having
equipment on-site, or physicians may purchase ownership stakes in anticipation of planned
changes in practice patterns. Orthopedic surgeons who want to specialize in outpatient surgeries
may buy ownership stakes in ambulatory surgery centers. Physicians who believe that a
treatment is effective may be more likely to take an ownership stake in the facility or equipment
necessary to deliver it.
The setting for our study differs in some important respects from that of previous studies
of physician ownership. Most previous studies examine changes or differences in the volume of
a particular procedure. Changes may reflect specialization. In our case, all patients receive
treatment, either IMRT or another form of radiotherapy. Radiation oncologists may specialize by
tumor site but do not specialize by treatment modality. Also, it is safe to assume that by the start
of our study period, 2008, all radiation therapy clinics had the capability to perform IMRT, even
if they never used it in breast cancer patients. Differences in use between freestanding and
hospital-based clinics are not attributable to differences in the convenience or availability of
IMRT.

Data

Using SEER-Medicare data, we estimate the impact of clinic type (freestanding versus
hospital-based) and tumor laterality on the receipt of IMRT. SEER-Medicare includes tumor
registry records from regional SEER tumor registries linked with Medicare claims for Medicareeligible beneficiaries. The SEER registries capture 100% samples of cancer patients from
California, Georgia, Iowa, Hawaii, Utah, Kentucky, Louisiana, New Mexico, Connecticut,
Detroit, and Seattle. From SEER Medicare we selected a sample of women who were diagnosed
with early or regional stage breast cancer between 2008 and 2013 (the latest year available), were
66 years of age or older, were continuously enrolled in fee-for-service Medicare in the 24 month
window centered on the diagnosis date, underwent breast conserving surgery, and received postoperative radiotherapy. Details are presented in Table 1.

The primary outcome is the receipt of IMRT versus another form of radiation therapy.
The primary independent variable is provider type. We classified a patient as receiving treatment
at a freestanding clinic if her initial radiotherapy claim appeared in the National Claims History
file (freestanding clinics bill as physician offices). All other patients were classified as treated at
hospital-based clinics, which bill as hospital outpatient departments. We used a similar approach
to categorize the type of provider where the patient received surgery. Figure 2 shows that the
share of patients receiving treatment at freestanding clinics did not change over the study period.

Trends in treatment patterns

Figure 3 shows the proportion of patients receiving IMRT by provider type. For this
descriptive analysis, we include women diagnosed after 2000.
Initially, patients in hospital-based clinics were slightly more likely to receive IMRT.
However, by 2008, 29% of patients treated in freestanding clinics received IMRT compared with
only 12% percent of patients treated in hospital-based clinics.

Patients who did not receive IMRT either underwent conventional beam radiation or
brachytherapy. Brachytherapy requires the implantation of a catheter to deliver the radioactive
seeds. In breast cancer patients the implantation typically occurs during surgery, which precedes
radiotherapy, and so radiation oncologists have less influence over the use of brachytherapy. The
share of patients receiving brachytherapy was 10.6% in freestanding clinics and 10.4% in
hospital-based clinics.

Regression-adjusted differences

We estimated a probit regression to measure differences in the receipt of IMRT between
freestanding and hospital-based clinics, adjusted for observable patient characteristics. Table 2
presents sample means of the variables included in the model. Most of the markers of disease
severity – tumor size, whether cancer is detectable in the lymph nodes near the breast, and
whether the stage at diagnosis is local or regional – are similar between patients treated in
hospital-based and freestanding clinics.

The first column of Table 3 displays marginal effects from a probit regression. The
dependent variable equals 1 if the patient received IMRT and 0 if the patient received another
form of radiotherapy. Standard errors are clustered at the clinic level. Controlling for patient
characteristics, patients who received radiotherapy in freestanding clinics are 18 percentage
points more likely to receive IMRT.
The proportion of patients receiving IMRT is 7 percentage points higher among patients
with tumors in the left breast. Most of the coefficients on the other variables are small and nonsignificant.

We estimated an instrumental variables model to confirm that differences in the receipt of
IMRT are not biased by unobserved patient characteristics. We used the type of provider where
patients received surgery as an instrument. Patients receive surgery in one of three types of
providers 1) freestanding surgery centers, 2) hospitals with radiation oncology clinics, and 3)
hospitals that do not have radiation oncology clinics. We hypothesized that patients who received
surgery in hospitals with radiation oncology clinics were more likely to receive radiotherapy at a
hospital-based clinic.
The identifying assumption is that the characteristics of patients that determine the type
of facility at which they receive surgery are unrelated to the factors that determine whether they
receive IMRT, conditional on radiotherapy clinic type. The exclusion restriction would be
violated if patients with unobservable tumor characteristics related to their ability to benefit from
IMRT were more or less likely to receive surgery in hospitals with radiotherapy clinics. To the
extent that patients with unusual tumor anatomy are more likely to be referred to a particular type
of facility, they are probably more likely to go to a large hospital that has an onsite radiotherapy
clinic. However, limiting the sample to women undergoing breast conserving surgery reduces
variation in tumor anatomy.
Figure 3 shows the proportion of patients who receive post-operative radiotherapy by
surgery provider type. Compared to patients who receive surgery in freestanding surgery centers
and patients who receive surgery in hospitals that do not offer radiotherapy, patients who receive
surgery in hospitals that do offer radiotherapy are about 4 and 3 percentage points more likely to
receive post-operative radiotherapy. However, these differences are small in percentage terms
given that 78% of patients receive post-operative radiotherapy.

Table 4 shows patient characteristics by surgery provider type (as opposed to radiation
therapy provider type). Patients treated at freestanding and hospital-based clinics look fairly
similar, at least based on observable characteristics. What differences do exist suggest that
patients in freestanding clinics have worse prognoses. However, the tumor characteristic that is
most closely related to patients’ ability to benefit from IMRT, tumor laterality, does not differ.

Table 5 shows the proportion of patients receiving radiotherapy in a freestanding clinic
and IMRT across surgery provider types. Among patients receiving surgery in a freestanding
surgery center, 39.1% receive radiotherapy in a freestanding clinic. Among patients receiving
surgery in hospitals without a radiotherapy clinic, 68.3% received radiotherapy in a freestanding
clinic compared to only 18.5% of patients who received surgery in a hospital with a radiotherapy
clinic. Patients treated at hospitals without radiotherapy centers are more likely to receive IMRT,
reflecting the fact that 68.3% received radiotherapy in freestanding clinics. Conditional on
radiotherapy clinic type, IMRT use is similar across surgery provider types, providing support
for the validity of surgery setting as an instrument.

The second set of regression results in Table 3 shows marginal effects from an IV probit
model, fit in a single step using maximum likelihood, with standard errors clustered at the clinic
level. The instrument is a dichotomous variable equal to 1 if the patient received surgery at a
hospital that offers radiation therapy. The coefficient on the instrument from a “first stage” linear
probability model that assessed the impact of the instrument and the other independent variables
on the likelihood of receiving radiation therapy in a freestanding clinic is -0.38 (i.e., 38
percentage points) and is significant at the 1% level. The F-statistic associated with the
instrument is 152. Results from the IV probit model are similar to those from the baseline model.
The third set of regression results are from an IV probit model estimated on the
subsample of patients who received surgery at hospitals, where observable patient characteristics
are similar between hospitals with and without radiotherapy clinics. Marginal effects are similar
to those from the other models.
Following David and Neuman (2011), we also examined differences in the use of IMRT
by facility type among physicians who practice in both types. Among the 998 physicians who
treated at least 5 patients over the study period, there are 78 who treated at least 20% but no more
than 80% of their patients in freestanding clinics. We term these physicians “splitters,” reflecting
the fact that they treated patients in both settings. We estimated the impact of treatment setting
on the likelihood of receiving IMRT among patients treated by splitters. Patients treated by
splitters in freestanding clinics were 12 percentage points (95% CI: 5 to 19 percentage points)
18

more likely to receive IMRT. This result provides additional evidence that there is a causal
relationship between clinic type and treatment.

Practice setting and personalized medicine

Figure 5 shows clinic-level treatment patterns by tumor laterality for clinics that treated at
least 30 patients between 2008 and 2013. Circles above the 45 degree line indicate clinics where
the share of patients with left-side tumors who received IMRT exceeds the share of patients with
right-side tumors who received IMRT. There is substantial heterogeneity in clinic treatment
patterns. Freestanding clinics seem to be disproportionally represented among clinics that have
IMRT use rates above 50% and cluster around the 45 degree line.

Table 6 shows unadjusted rates and differences in the use of IMRT by clinic type and
tumor laterality. Physicians in both types of clinics personalized medicine, in the sense that
patients with left-side tumors were more likely to receive IMRT. However, patients were more
likely to receive IMRT if they were treated in a freestanding clinic, regardless of tumor type. In
fact, patients with right-sided tumors in freestanding clinics were more likely to receive IMRT
compared to patients with left-sided tumors treated in hospital-based clinics.
The difference in IMRT use between patients with left- and right-side tumors is 2.1
percentage points higher in freestanding clinics. The adjusted difference, from a probit model
that includes an interaction between clinic type and tumor laterality, is 2.2 (-2.0 to 6.2)
percentage points. The confidence interval is wide, but the point estimate is consistent with the
prediction that treatment rates among high-benefit patients are more responsive to incentives

Figure 6 displays trends in the share of patients receiving IMRT by laterality. Interestingly,
differences in the use of IMRT between patients with left- and right-side tumors grew larger over
time, at least until 2009. This contrasts with typical patterns of use of new technologies, where
initially physicians use them in patients most likely to benefit and then gradually expand use to
other patients. Physicians, especially ones in hospital-based clinics, appear to have become more
discriminating over time. Perhaps these patterns reflect greater attention to cardiac-related
morbidity from radiotherapy.

Conclusions

Personalized medicine has the potential to help physicians better match patients to
treatments and reduce costs in the process. However, the effects of new tests and algorithms will
depend on the financial incentives facing physicians. When physicians face incentives to induce
demand, additional information may lead to higher levels of treatment. We cannot test the
prediction directly, but the data are consistent with another prediction: that treatment rates in the
high benefit patient group are more responsive to incentives.
21

Consistent with prior studies, we find that patients treated in freestanding clinics were
significantly more likely to receive IMRT. Our instrumental variables analysis and analysis of
treatment patterns by physicians who treat patients in both clinic types suggests that the
relationship is causal.
We find that women with right-side tumors treated in freestanding clinics were more
likely to undergo IMRT than women with left-side tumors treated in hospital based clinics. This
result implies that payers will need to link coverage policies to the results of personalized
medicine tests (and enforce these policies) if they hope to leverage personalized medicine to
reduce overtreatment. Simply requiring that physicians perform the tests may be insufficient
when tests are imperfect. Broadly speaking, our results highlight the challenge of maximizing the
benefit of tests that imperfectly predict patients’ ability to benefit from a treatment in an
environment where physicians’ compensation is linked to the volume or intensity of treatments
they provide.
