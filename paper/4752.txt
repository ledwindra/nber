THE GREAT WARS, THE GREAT
CRASH. AND THE UNIT ROOT
HYPOTHESIS: SOME NEW EVIDENCE

ABOUT AN OLD STYIflD FACT
ABSTRACT
For decades, the prevailing sentiment among economists was that growth rates remain
constant over the long run. Kaldor considered this to be one of the six important "stylized facts"

that theory should address, and until the emergence of endogenous growth models, this was a
fundamental feature of growth theory.
This paper uses an endogenous trend break model to investigate the unit root hypothesis

for 16 countries, using annual ODP data spanning up to 130 years. Rejection of the unit root,
which is facilitated by the inclusion of a trend break, introduces the possibility of examining the

long run behavior of growth rates.

We find that most countries exhibited fairly steady growth for a period lasting several
decades. The termination of this period was usually characterized by a significant, and sudden,

drop in GD!' levels. But rather than simply returning to their previous steady state path, as
predicted by the standard neoclassical growth model, most countries continued to grow at roughly

double their prebreak rates for many decades, even alter theft original growth path had been
surpassed.

I. INTRODUCTION

One of the fundamental "stylized facts" that characterized postwar growth literature is
that output grows "at a steady trend rate", both in aggregate and per worker ternis (Kaldor,
1961). This feature is

one of the prominent characteristics of the Solow (1956) neoclassical

growth model. Three decades later, the endogenous growth literature, starting with Romer

(1986), has shown that growth rates need not be constant and they may actually increase over
time.
Empirical research on this issue has not provided a clear choice between the endogenous

and neoclassical growth models. Romer (1986 and 1989) provides evidence that growth rates

have been rising over time. Using data from Maddison (1982), he shows that rates of growth
for countries that were productivity leaders have risen since 1700. In an analysis of the United

States, Romer (1986) calculates 40 year annual averages and finds increases in the rates of

growth between 1840 and 1978.

Abraxnovitz (1989), however, uses moving average

computations to smooth business fluctuations and concludes that U.S. aggregate and per capita

growth rates exhibited a slowdown between 1870 and 1953. In contrast, Romer (1986), using
one observation per decade, rejects the hypothesis that there is a non-positive trend 4n the growth

rate over successive decades for eight of eleven countries. He then shows how, within a fully
specified equilibrium, per capita output may grow without bound at rates that can be increasing

over time.
The analysis here differs from the Romer and Abramovitz studies in that it does not use
broad averages based on arbitrary period lengths to determine the long run behavior of growth

2

rates. Recent breakthroughs in time series analysis enable an endogenous determination of trend

breaks within the framework of unit root tests. Rejection of the unit root null permits the
calculation of steady state growth rates.
Our empirical work builds upon much previous research which examines whether real

GNP (or GDP) can be characterized by a unit root. Following Nelson and Plosser's (1982)
failure to reject the unit root null for either aggregate or per capita U.S. GNP, Perron (1989),
with the break date determined exogenously, and Zivot and Andrews (1992), with an endogenous

break choice, find that the unit root hypothesis can be rejected if a one-time break is
incorporated in the deterministic trend. While the above studies focus on the U.S., Raj (1992)

and Perron (1993) use endogenous trend break tests and extend the unit root analysis to
additional countries.'
In this paper, we utilize up to 130 years of annual aggregate and per capita (JDP data for
16

countries to investigate whether economic growth is constant or changing over time. For

nearly every one of the countries, the trend break which provides the strongest evidence against
the unit root null

is associated with a sharp decline in GD?: World War II for most countries,

World War I or the Great Depression for the rest.
This study provides empirical evidence that while countries do tend to exhibit relatively

constant growth rates for extended periods of time, the occurrence of a major shock to the
economy appears to result in a drop in levels followed by sustained growth that exceeds the
earlier steady state growth. In 20 of the 32 cases examined (16 aggregate and 16 per capita),

countries exhibit significant steady state behavior, growing at constant rates until a major

extends their work by examining more countries over a longer time span.

3

upheaval occurs. Posthrealc growth of aggregate GDP for stationary countries was twice the
prebreak growth. In the case of per capita GD!', postbrealc growth rates were, on avenge, two
and a half time the prebreak rates.2
The finding that posthreak exceed prebreak growth rates is not sufficient to distinguish
between the neoclassical and endogenous growth models. White both fnmeworks would predict
this outcome during the transition phase back to the steady state path, the neoclassical model also

predicts that, once the steady state is reached, growth rates should return to their prebreak steady

state values. Our results show that the faster growth usually continues even after the countries

reach, and eventually surpass, their previous steady state paths, with the new, post-transition,
rates of growth greatly exceeding the old steady state rates.

This result suggests a possible bridge between the Romer-type increasing growth
predictions and the Olson (1982) explanation that major social upheavals can cause a breakup
of coalitions whose long-term existence may have lead to a petrification of resource allocations

within an economy. The ensuing removal of these rigidities can lead to a more efficient
allocation of resources and hence, to faster subsequent growth. We find the existence of a
significant relationship between the magnitude of the decline in GDP levels and the subsequent

increase in ppst-transition period growth rates over prebreak steady state rates.'

The paper is organized as follows. Sequential Dickey-Fuller tests for unit roots are
summarized and empirical results are presented in Section II. Implications of these results for

level for both aggregate and per capita real GDP growth for all 16 countries.

issues involving economic growth are considered in Section III. Conclusions are presented in
Section IV.

IL TREND BREAKS AND UNIT ROOTS

The question of whether macroeconomic variables, in particular real GNP, can be
characterized by unit roots has been the subject of considerable investigation.4 Nelson and
Plosser (1982), in a widely cited study using long-term annual data for

the United States, showed

that the null hypothesis of a unit root could not be rejected for most macroeconomic variables.5
These results have not gone unchallenged. Perron (1989) argues that only two events,

the Great Crash of 1929 and the oil price shock of 1973, have had a permanent effect on
macroeconomic variables. Using the same data as Nelson and Plosser, he shows that, allowing

a single change in either the intercept of the trend function after 1929 or the slope of the trend

function after 1973, most macroeconomic variables, including aggregate and per capita GNP,
are trend stationary.6
Perron's results have also not gone unchallenged. In Perron (1989), the date of the break

is treated as known. Christiaao (1992) argues that the date of the break should be treated as
unknown a priori. He uses bootstrap methods to compute appropriate critical values, and shows

The exception was the unemployment rate.

Rappoport and Rejeblin (t939) also develop unit root tests with trend breaks.

5

that there is little evidence in favor of the hypothesis that postwar U.S. real GNP is stationary

around a broken trend against the unit root null.7
This study uses an endogenous trend break model to investigate the unit root hypothesis

for both aggregate and per capita (iDe. Two issues, both emphasized by Campbell and Perron

(1991), guide our choices of data and tests. First, the power of unit root tests is largest when
the span of the data is longest. Second, lengthening the span of the data increases the possibility

of a major structural change. We utilize a much longer time span (130 and 120 years for most
of the aggregate and per capita data, respectively) and include more countries (sixteen) than is
common in unit root studies.

The sequential Dickey-Fuller tests of Zivotand Andrews (1992) axe run on data compiled
by Maddison (1991).' He provides annual (IDP data for 16 countries, mostly starting in 1860

for aggregate and 1870 for per capita data and ending in 1989. Indexes of annual aggregate real

7Baneijee. Lucusdaine, and Stock (1992) use a variety of tests based on asymptotic distribution theory, which also
treat the break date as unknown a priori, to investigate these questions. Using postwar GNP for the 0-7 countries,
they can only reject the unit root null in favor of the trend shift hypothesis for Japan. Zivot and Andrews (1992).
using & sequential Dickey-Fuller test on both long-nan and postwar Nelson-Plosser data, find less evidence against
the unit root hypothesis than was found by Penon (1989).

'These tests are univariate. Sal, Lumsdaine, and Stock (1991) develop nualtivarinte tests for dating breaks, but do

not test for unit roots.

population levels.9 While the annual aggregate data begins in 1860 for most countries, the per
capita GDP is limited by the population data which begins in 1870.
It should be pointed out that data for the war years tends to beconsiderably less accurate

than for the remaining years. Thus, one should not attach too much importance to a break that
occurs during one war year rather than another. The emphasis here wilt be on the fact that the
break is related to a war rather than to a precise year.

These concerns are particularly important in the case of Germany, which underwent
several wars that coincided with substantial population and territorial changes over the past

century. Maddison (1991) makes an important contribution in trying to correct for these
changes, but nonetheless, a note of caution is warranted regarding the accuracy of the German
results.

To provide a benchmark for our later results, we compute Augmented Dickey-Fuller
(ADF) tests which do not incorporate breaks (the results appear in the Appendix). For 15 of
the 16 countries, the null hypothesis of a unit root cannot be rejected at the 10percent level for

either aggregate or per capita real GDP. These findings support Nelson and Plosser's (1982)

inability to reject the unit root null, despite our utilization otmuch longer spans of data.
Surprisingly, the lone exception is the United States (which was tho basis of the Nelson and

The Maddison data were modified for
consistency purposes. For example, the regions of Alsace and Lorraine

were nc ud in the French total and deducted from the 6ev-an total population count. The U.K. figures were
adjusted so as not to include Irish 61W or population. Also, the Italian population statistic for 1870 was augmented
by Rom&s population so as to accord with the subsequent Italian population data. These changes were relatively
nunor and did not affect the ADF regressions in any meaningful way.

Plosser study), where the null can be rejected at the 5, but not the 1, patent level for both
variables.

A plausible reason for the failure of our ADE tests to reject the unit root null is
misspeciftcation of the detenninistic components included as regressors.'° With long spans of

data, it becomes more likely that the series of interest is characterized by a major stnscturai
change. Failure to account for such a structural change biases the test in favor of the unit root

null hypothesis, that the series {yJ is an integrated process without an exogenous structural
break, is tested against the alternative hypothesis that {yj is trend stationary with a one-time

break in the trend function which occurs at an unknown time)2

-

Following Perron's nomenclature, there are three possible models under the alternative
hypothesis.

Model A, the 'crash" model, allows for a change in the intercept of the trend

function (this will be referred to as a level change), DLI, but not in the slope. Model B, the
'changing growth' model, allows for a change in the slope of the trend function (to be referred

to as a trend change), DT, but not in the intercept. Model C allows for both level and trend
changes. We first estimate regressions for Model C under the alternative.

If the i-statistics on

DLI and DT are both significant for the chosen TB,, we report the results for Model C. If either
(-statistic is insignificant, we drop the associated variable and estimate either Model A or B.'3
Our major results are summarized in Table I and the full set of coefficients and
associated i-statistics are presented in Table A2 (panels

A and B). For the vast majority of

countries, both the intercept and slope trend break dummy variables are significant, making

Model C the appropriate model. Model A is estimated for Switzerland and Model B for

Germany)4 For the United States, Model A is estimated for aggregate real GDP but Model
C is estimated for per capita real GDP. This differs from both Perron (1989) and Zivot and

1 OUT specification is identical to Zivot and Andrews (1992). Perron (1989, 1993) takes the time of break to be
exogenous under the null, which requires estimating an additional dummy variable DIP,

otherwise. We estimated our models with this additional variable. The results were essentially unchanged, except
that, as to Perron (1993), most of the break dates were one year earlier.

3 There were no cases where both g-cthtstr were insignificant for Model C. When Models A or B were
estimated, the 1-statistics for DU and Dr. respectively, were always significant. Since the choice among models
does not depend on the Dickey-Fullet- i-statistic, this selection procedure will not affect the critical values.

"Following PerioD (1993), we estimate Model B as a two-step procedure and the coefficients for Gennany in Table
A2 reflect this.

Andrews (1992), neither of which allows for a change in the slope of the trend function and thus
estimates Model A by assumption.'3

The dates of the breaks accord closely with intuition. The countries which exhibit
significant breaks during the Second World War; Japan, Norway, and the continental European

countries (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and
Switzerland), are those which were most affected by the War." Breaks occur during the First
World War for the United Kingdom (where the trauma of the War was followed by the loss of
Ireland and the outhreak of an extremely deadly and widespread flu epidemic), Finland (which
achieved independence from Russia), and Sweden.

'The countries that were most removed physically and suffered the least damage during

both World Wars; Australia, Canada, and the United States, exhibit breaks between 1925 and

1929. The results of Zivot and Andrews (1992) concerning real GNP for the United States
continue to hold with our longer span of data. We find the time of break to be 1929 for both
aggregate and per capita real GD?, exactly what was assumed by Perron and found by Zivot and

Andrews, This result, based on a span of data about twice as long as the Nelson-Plosser data,
provides further evidence for the Great Crash as the cause of the U.S. break.'7

"We also ran sequential ADF tests on the long-term GNP data analyzed in Backus and Kehoc (1992), which we
thank David Backus for providing. For the six countries; Australia, Canada, Italy, S den; the United Kingdom,
and the United States, for which the Backus-Keboe data did not contain gaps, the choice of models, selection of
break dates, and significance levels of Dickey-Fuller i-statistics was similar to the Maddison data.

Norway was invaded by (ennany in 1940.

" It is interesting to compare our results for the United States with those of Zivot awl Audrews (1992). For

aggregate real GDP, we choose Model A with lag length k = I and rejeci the unit root null at the I percent level.
These results accord exactly with those of Zivot and Mdrews. For — capita real CDI', we choose Model C with
lag length Jr = 8, while Zivot and Andrews assume Model A. We reject the unit root null for per capita GD? at
the I percent level while Zivot and Andrews can only reject it a! the 10 percent level. Thus, using a longer span
of data, we find as much evidence against the unit root hypothesis for aggregate, and considerably more for per
capita, real GDP than was found by Zlvot and Andrews.

10

The Great Crash, however, did not cause the break for any other country. For the vast

majority of countries, 13 out of 16, the breaks were caused by wars. Even for Australia and
Canada, where the breaks were associated with the onset of the Great Depression, they occur

before 1929. The Dickey-Fuller i-statistics associated with all possible break years are plotted

for per capita real GDP in Figure 1 for Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United

States)5 The break year was the same for both aggregate and per capita GDP for 11 of the
16 countries.

The central result of this section is that allowing for breaks produces considerable
evidence against the unit root hypothesis for both aggregate and per capita real GDP. We can
reject the unit root null at the 1 percent level in 16 out of 32 cases, 8 each for aggregate and per

capita. This contrasts with the failure of conventional ADF tests, which do not allow for breaks,
to reject the unit root null at the 1 percent level in any of the 32 cases. At the 10 percent level,
where conventional ADF tests reject the null in only 2 of the 32 cases, we reject the null in 20
cases, 9 for aggregate and 11 for per capita real GDP.

Issues involving economic growth are of great importance to both macroeconomic theory
and policy. In this section, we show that countries which exhibit trend stationarity will converge
to a steady state growth path. We then develop the implications of trend breaks by comparing
prebreak and postbreak steady state growth rates.

Suppose that k = 0 (i.e. no lagged differences). Then the standard Dickey-Fuller type

first-order difference equation with drift and trend is

13

Thus, rejection of the unit root null implies that growth rates will stabilize around a
constant value that is not dependent on k or the c's.2° This value, -fl/a, will be referred to as
the steady state rate of growth.
Row then, does the existence of a break in the trend function affect steady state growth?

A level change (i.e. a change in the intercept of Equation 1) affects income levels, but it has no

effect on the growth rates. On the other hand, a trend change (i.e. a change in the slope, or
trend, coefficient) in the presence of stationarity will have an impact on the country's steady
state growth path.
Steady state growth rates were calculated for each country using the estimated coefficients

from Table A2 for the trend ( /1) and lagged GDP ( d ). The postbreak growth rates also
incorporate the increment to fi given by f , the coefficient for the trend dummy variable, DT.

These steady state rates appear in Table 2. The results should be treated with caution in the
cases of countries for which the null of a unit root could not be rejected (the stationary countries

are marked with an asterisk). The countries are grouped according to their time of break.
The postbreak rates of growth clearly exceed the prebreak rates. With aggregate GOP,
the average steady-state postbreak rate for the nine stationary countries was nearly double the
prebreak rate. For all 16 countries, the postbreak rate was 78 percent above the prebreak rate.

With per capita GDP, the average steady state posthreak rate was nearly two and a half times

the prebreak growth rate for both the 11 stationary and for all 16 countries.
The differences were largest for those countries which experienced trend breaks during

World War II, with the average ratio of postwar to prewar growth rates equal to 2.06 for

Z The intuition behind this is that, in augmenS

Dickey-Fuller tests, the rejection or non-rejection of the taut root
hypothesis depends only on the value of a, not on the c's.

aggregate

and 2.70 for per capita GDP. The average ratios of postbreak to prebreak growth

were also greater than unity for the World War I and Great Depression trend break countries.
As with

the

World War H countries, the increase in steady state growth was greater for per

capita than for aggregate GDP.
The results in Table 2 appear to confirm the Romer predictions. Of the sixteen countries

analyzed here over a 120 year time span, all but one displayed higher postbreak per capita
growth, with steady state growth ratios exceeding unity.2' Not one country exhibited any
evidence of moving to a new path with slower growth (i.e. a sub-unity growth ratio).

While 15 of the 16 countries experienced faster per capita income growth following the
break in trend, in 14 of these countries the heightened growth followed a significant drop in
income levels. The question is, how related are these two events? Of the three groups, the

WWII countries exhibited the highest steady state growth after their breaks, while the mean drop

in their postbreak income levels was 2½-3 times as large, on average, as that experienced by
the

other two groups (Table 2). Can the higher postbreak growth be a reflection of the

immensity of the negative shock experienced b the countries?
One possibility is that it takes many years to return to the stable path and the faster
growth simply reflects transition back to the previous steady state path rather than to a new,
higher steady state growth path. This possibility is examined below. Alternatively, this might

be evidence of Mancur Olson's (1982) notion that major upheavals tend to lead to a breakup of
old "distributional" coalitions. Once the major coalitions lose power, they can no longer impede

The lone exception being Switz.eñand which cxpesienced * positive level change at the teniiinatioa of the Second

a more efficient redistribution of resources. If that is the case, then one would expect faster
growth to follow the major reorganizations that occurred during the periods in question.

The relationship between the mean drop in incomes and the subsequent increase in growth
rates over the prebreak steady state rates may be estimated by regressing

where DROG, is the relative increase in growth rates from their prebreak paths to their postbreak

paths and O is the calculated drop in income for country i (both vectors are drawn from the

estimates by country, so an income reduction is represented by a negative 6,

The results, which appear in Table 3, reflect a significant relationship between the magnitude

of the level changes induced by the break and the changes in the growth rates which followed.
Much of the increase in growth rates (over the prebreak growth) can be attributed to the fall in
incomes that followed the breaks.22

While it is clear that postbreak growth exceeded the prebreak steady state rates, there
remains a question of whether these results are simply driven by the rebound of the countries

during their respective transition periods. In other words, these findings may be simply a
reflection, of the neoclassical growth model's prediction that growth should be faster during the
transition back to the steady state path. What happens when the transition periods are omitted

from the postbreak results? Do GDP levels and growth rates return to their prebreak paths?

Though the level changes account for approximately one half of the growth increases, it is clear that these may
not be the only possible explanation for the higher postbreak growth. Germany is one example where no level
changes were found to be significant though the country exhibited increases in trend. Though the country's Income
clearly fell at the termination of the Second World War, its rebound was so fast and so thorough that the data do
not indicate any lasting level effects from the Wat The country did however expeñeace an increase in its steady
state growth rates (by 23 percent for aggregate GDP and 47 percent for per capita GDP). While
poor prewar data
may be the source of some of these apparent changes, there are probably other factors causing the growth increase.

The length of each country's transition period was found by extrapolating the prebreak

steady state growth path of each country from the year prior to the break. The end of the
transition period is determined when the actual levels of GD? eventually equaled that of the
fitted levels, i.e. when the country returned to its prebreak path. This left the post-transition

years which could then be compared to the prebreak years.
A graphical depiction of this exercise appears in Figure 2. For completeness, the per
capita GDP graphs for every one of the 16 countries is provided in this figure. In 13 of the 16

countries, there is a noticeable transition period followed by visual evidence that the posttransition behavior of GD? was clearly different from that of the prebreak years. In each of
these countries, post-transition growth exceeded prebreak growth by a substantial margin. Of
the three remaining countries, the United States and Canada exhibited results that conformed
very closely to the neoclassical predictions of a return to the steady state path, both in terms of

growth rates as well as levels. The third country, Switzerland was an outlier model A country
that experienced a positive level change in its break year, 1944.

The visual evidence is corroborated by a comparison of the calculated average annual

growth rates in Table 4. For those countries with transition periods, the actual growth rates
exceeded the fitted steady states rates from the post-transition period by 78 percent for aggregate

and 131 percent for per capita GD?. An estimation of Equation 6 with the post-transition

growth rojios (of actual to fitted average growth rates) on the left-hand side indicates a
significant relationship between the increase in growth rates and the magnitude of the drop in

GDP levels (Table 5).
Thus the Olson explanation that big shocks are required as a precursor to heightened
growth may be consistent with the Romer prediction. If, as Romer suggests, growth rates have

a tendency to increase over time, then one might expect a linearization of such a process (caused
by the presence of Olson-type rigidities). Following a period of major upheaval, these rigidities
are removed and the economy can reap the benefits of a more efficient reallocation of resources.

lv. CONCLUSIONS
The findings of this study show that each of the 16 OECD countries analyzed exhibited
a significant trend break over the past one and a quarter century. Once the endogenously

determined trend breaks are accounted for, the unit root null, which could not be rejected
otherwise (with the exception of the United States), can be rejected for the majority of these
countries.

Trend stationarity is necessary for convergence to a steady state growth path. The
determination of significant trend breaks enables the calculation of asymptotic growth rates for
each subperiod. These "steady state" rates are markedly higher following the breaks. This is

still true after omitting the period of transition back to the prebreak steady state path. This
evidence that steady state growth rates appear to be growing over extended periods of time is

in contradiction with the predictions of the neoclassical growth model as well as With ICaldor's

(1961) stylized fact that growth rates remain steady over time. However, increasing growth is
compatible with Romer-type endogenous growth models. Furthermore, increases in the growth
rates also appear to be significantly related to the decreases in income leveti that coincided with

18

the breaks. The combination of these two findingsallows us to reconcile Romer's and Olson's
theories about economic growth.

APPENDIX: AUGMENTED DICKEY-FULLER TESTS
The Augmented Dickey-Fuller test involves regressing the first-difference of a variable
on a constant, trend, its lagged level, and k first-differences,

p+

t + ay

+

+

tCJ4Y:J

where y is the logarithm of real GD?. The null hypothesis of a unit root is rejected if a, the
coefficient on the lagged level of output, is significantly different from zero. While the
asymptotic distribution of the i-statistic for a is non-normal, critical values have been calculated

by, among many others, MacKinnon (1991). The absolute value of the (-statistic for a is often
cafle4 the Dickey-Fuller s-statistic.

We follow the procedure suggested by Campbell and Perron (1991) to select the value

of k. Start with an upper bound on k chosen a priori. If the last included lag is significant,
choose the upper bound. If not, reducek by one until the last lag becomes significant. If no
lags are significant, set k = 0. Following Perron (1989) and Ziivot and Andrews (1992), we set
thç upper bound on k to equal 8 and the criterion for significance of the s-statistic on the last lag

equal to 1.60!
The results of the ADF tests are reported in able Al. For 15 of the 16 countries, the
null hypothesis of a unit root cannot be rejected at the 10 percent level for either aggregate or
per capita real GD?. The exception is the United States, where the null can be rejected at the
5, but not the I, percent level for both variables. Since Nelson and Plosser (1982), using annual

While alternatives to our selection csiteria exist, we follow the identical procedwe used by Perron md Zivot and

for the United States at the 10 percent level, this accords with the conjecture, expressed by
Christiano and Eichenbaum (1990), that the failure to reject unit roots in real GM!' may be

related to the short time span of available data?' Our results for the other 15 countries,
however, using equally long spans of data, do not support this conjecture. If the unit root null

cannot be rejected with 130 years of annual data, it does not appear likely that searching for
additional data will make much difference.

' The power of unit root tests, as discussed by Campbell md Perron (1991), depends on the span of the data rather
than on the number of observations.
