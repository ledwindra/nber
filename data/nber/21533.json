    "abstract": "\n\nA four-factor model with two \"mispricing\" factors, in addition to market and size factors, accommodates a large set of anomalies better than notable four- and five-factor alternative models.  Moreover, our size factor reveals a small-firm premium nearly twice usual estimates.  The mispricing factors aggregate information across 11 prominent anomalies by averaging rankings within two clusters exhibiting the greatest co-movement in long-short returns.  Investor sentiment predicts the mispricing factors, especially their short legs, consistent with a mispricing interpretation and the asymmetry in ease of buying versus shorting. Replacing book-to-market with a single composite mispricing factor produces a better-performing three-factor model.\n\n",
