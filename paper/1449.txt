Relative Factor Price Changes and Equity Prices

ABSTRACT

This paper suggests that the decline in equity prices, and thus in
Tobin's average q, during the 1970s may be attributable to changes in expected

relative factor prices. More specifically, q is shown to be a negative
function of the extent to which current relative factor price expectations

differ from those when capital was put in place. Because relative factor
prices became more volatile after 1967, the observed decline in average q, and
thus in stock prices, can be explained by the "relative price" hypothesis.

INTRODUCTION

A widely documented empirical anomaly of the 1970s is the poor
performance of equity prices and consequent decline of average Tobin's

q.' While the real value of corporate equity increased 113 percent
during the 1957-68 period, it declined 20 percent between 1968 and 1979

in spite of substantial retained earnings. Put another way, every
estimate of average q remains relatively stable until 1968, and then
declines approximately 50 percent during the next decade [von Furstenberg
(1977), Holland and Myers (1980), President of the U.s. (1983)].

While no shortage of explanations exists for the decline in real
equity values, the most viable of these is that the real return on

existing capital has declined [Hendershott (1981)]. But why has it
declined and is the decline sufficient to produce the observed fall in

equity values? Bruno (1984) maintains that the sharp run-up in real
materials prices during the 1970s, following a decade of decline, explains

the slowdown in manufacturing productivity. A generalization of his
argument suggests that unanticipated changes in real factor prices
generally (but materials prices most importantly) reduced the profit-

ability of existing capital. Moreover, the reduction appears to have
been sufficient to explain the entire decline in average Tobin's q.
Section I demonstrates that the value of outstanding (vintage)

capital declines when relative factor prices change unexpectedly. More
specifically, capital values are shown to be a negative function of the
extent to which current relative factor price expectations differ from
those of earlier periods when capital was put in place.

The data required to simulate the impact of relative factor prices

on q are discussed in Section II. In particular, an aggregate production

2

function is specified, and input prices are estimated in order to compute
constrained and unconstrained cost functions.

Section III contains empirical evidence regarding the importance of

unexpected changes in relative factor prices to average q. First,
simulated average q values are compared graphically with the above cited

estimates of average q. Second, von Furstenberg's q is shown to be
related to our simulated series in the expected way.

A.

TilE TILEORY

Relative Factor Prices and Economic Obsolescence
The basic argument can be made in terms of a two-factor ex ante

production function

Y =

Y(K,

L),

(1)

that is continuous and strictly quasi-concave.2 At t0, Y is the flow
of gross output, K0 is the flow of services from capital equipment and

structures, and L0 is the flow of services from labor. Firm value is
maximized by choosing inputs L and K so as to

mm.

k0K + w0L

s.t.

(1),

(2)

where the prices of capital and labor, k0 and w0, are expected to persist
throughout the economic life of K0.

Without loss of generality, we set Y1. Solving the F.O.C. of (2),
the firm's input demands per unit of capacity are

K0 = K(k0, w0)
L0 =

L(k0,

w0).

(3)

3

Given (3), the firm

expects

to produce with K0 assets and incur costs of

C0k0K0+w0L0. Firm value V0 is the discounted value of the profit
expected from the initial investment

V0 =
t= 1

(l_t)(P0_C0)(1d)t/(1+r)t

(4)

where t is the statutory marginal corporate tax rate, P0 is the output
price, d is the economic depreciation rate and r is the weighted average

net real cost of capital. Aspects of the current tax code other than
the statutory corporate rate are captured by the capital price k0 and
are discussed below. We assume that the output price P is set by applying
a fixed markup N to the minimum cost achievable, given expected factor

prices.3 Thus

V0

(1-t)NC0/(r+d).

(5)

At expected prices k0 and w0, the replacement value (cost) of the

most efficient technology capable of producing Y, RC0, equals V0. Thus,
q0 = V0/RCØ =

1.

(6)

Initially, marginal q and average q both equal unity because all outstanding capital is new.

Assume that the relative price of labor undergoes an unanticipated

change at t+1 that is expected to persist forever. The change in w

produces a new solution to (2). In particular, L1L0 as w1w0. Capital
demand increases (declines) as w rises if K and L are substitutes (compli-

ments). New firms will producewith the new optimal factor mix (K1,L1)
at a cost C1=k0K1+w1L1 and will have marginal and average q's of unity.

4

The same will be true of existing firms if they can costlessly change

factor mixes. Because the shift entails costs, existing firms will
likely not shift to the (K1,L1) mix and their value will decline.

To illustrate this point, say that it is technically impossible to
transform K0 into K1; input substitution is possible for labor, but

firms can substitute K1 only as K0 decays. Input choice for existing
firms is now deteraiined by

mm.

k0K + w1L

s.t.

(1), K =

(7)

I(o.

Factor demands for the constrained minimization are

K = K(k0,
=

L(k0,

(8)

w0)

w0, w1).

Firms that have committed themselves to producing with K0 have costs of

Ck0K+w1L and a market value of

V = (P1-C)(1-t)/(r+d),

(9)

where P1(1+N)C1,
Replacement cost at t1 may be defined in two ways. First, firms
may replace the old input set (K0, L1) with (K1, L1). In a competitive
market, inputs are replaced at cost

RC1 =

(P1—C1)(l—t)/(r+d),

(10)

where C1=k0K1+w1L1. Because new firms cost RC1, equation (10) represents
an opportunity cost. A second definition of replacement cost assumes
that the base period replacement cost RC0 changes with output prices.

5

That is, the current replacement cost is RC0P1/PQ. This definition is
used in all time series estimates of replacement cost.4 While replacement
cost may be defined in either of two ways, our model suggests that the
two definitions are equivalent, i.e., RC0P1/P0=RC1 because NC1=P1-C1.

This is a convenient result because it implies that replacement cost can
be estimated with an arbitrarily chosen base period.

Average q (q) for existing firms is market value [equation (9)]
divided by replacement cost [equation (10)1 or

q =

1

+ N1(1 -

C/C1).

(11)

That is, average q is negatively related to the cost function ratio
c{IC1.

Three points are of interest regarding equation (10). First,

average q no longer equals marginal q. Average q, q, is less than
marginal q, q1V1/RC1, because the constraints found in (6) imply that

C>C1. This result is a direct application of Samuelson's (1947)
LeChatelier principle and holds for any common production function.5
The result disputes Hayashi's (1982) conclusion that "marginal q and
average q are essentially the same" when "the firm is a price-taker."

Second, the level of q is determined by the extent to which current
relative factor prices (w1) diverge from those of previous periods (w0).

The tax, depreciation and discount parameters, i.e., I, d and r, do not

effect q. As the absolute value of the difference between w0 and w1

rises, the cost function ratio rises causing q to fall. That is, q is
inversely related to (w1-w0)2.6 Third, q is homogeneous of degree zero
in (k, w). Therefore, neither inflation nor Hicks-neutral technical

6

change (k and w rise by the same proportion) effects average q. Only
relative factor price changes effect q.
Additional constraints on input substitution underscore the above

conclusions. For example, a second possible constraint is that capital
can only be combined with other inputs in fixed proportions, i.e., K1=K0

and L1=L0. The firm's input demands are now K'K0 and LrL0, so that
costs are a linear function of w1, Ck0k*+w1L*, and average q is

=

1 +

N1(1

—

C/C1).

(11')

Because Cr>C>C1, qf*<q<q1l. Thus the share price response to a
change in relative factor prices rises with the number of constraints on

a firm's ability to produce efficiently. Capital with low malleability
is "risky" in the sense that its value is especially sensitive to relative
factor price fluctuations.

Figure la plots cost curves representing the previous optimization

problems. At w1w0, all firms are constrained to using the optimal
input set. Hence, the constraints are not effective and all cost curves

are tangent. As w1 either increases or decreases, the effectiveness of
the constraints increases. Firms that choose inputs according to (7)

move along C while those unable to perform any input substitution move

along Cr. In contrast, costs incurred by new firms lie on C1.
Figure lb shows the value function corresponding to each cost

function in la. The value of a new firm, relative to replacement cost,

is always unity. If w1w0, then the value of an old firm is also unity
because constraints on input substitution are not effective. Old firms
are cost efficient because w1 was correctly anticipated. This implies
that marginal q equals average q, i.e.,

constraints on input substitution are effective. In this case, the
value of old firms is less than the value of new finns and average q is

less than marginal q. Also, the difference between marginal q and
average q rises (falls) as the number and/or effectiveness of constraints
on input substitution rises (falls).

Intuitively, an unanticipated change in relative factor prices
renders outstanding production methods economically obsolete, i.e.,
input combinations become available that can produce a given output more

cost advantage held by new input combinations translates into lower

output prices, causing the market value of firms using old input combinations to fall.

B.

Value Over Time

The two period model presented above assumes that all investment

occurs at t0. In this case, an unexpected relative factor price shock
causes the same proportionate value decline for all capital units. If
firms purchase capital over time, then the capital stock at a given
point in time consists of the investment that remains from previous

periods. That is,

Kt

where

I_1(1-d)3,

(12)

w_) is the investment made during t-j. If factor

prices kt_j and w_ change over time, then each t-j investment is
unique in that it minimizes costs for a particular set of expected

factor prices. Therefore, the character of the capital stock changes as

expected relative factor prices change. As old capital decays and new

9

capital is purchased, the most recent relative factor price expectations

will be disproportionately heavily represented in Kt. However, there
will always be a large number of different types of investment, one for
each previous relative factor price expectation.

The effect of a relative factor price shock on observed average q

is complicated by a multi-period capital stock Kt. For the value model
described by equation (1P), firm value relative to replacement cost is
now written as

Q=

(13)
J

where

and q*. is the relative value of input combina-

tions chosen in period t-j. Changes in

can occur because the

weights change or because relative factor price movements cause the

to change. If current relative factor price expectations differ from

those of previous periods, then Q<l because q*.<1 for all j. Also,
Q** will tend to rise over time if relative factor price expectations

remain stable. If relative factor price expectations are constant

throughout the lifetime of all outstanding capital, then Q*1.
In practice, Q* will not always decline when expected relative
factor prices change. If the new set of expected relative factor prices
is closer to the prices that occurred in some previous period, productive

capacity purchased in that period will rise in value. Value only declines
for that portion of the capital stock that was installed for expected
factor prices that became even less likely owing to the unexpected
current change.

II. PRODUCTION SPECIFICATION AND DATA

Estimates of the effect of relative factor price movement on average

q are found by parameterizing the model and testing it. In particular,
a production function is specified, and factor prices estimated, in

order to compute constrained and unconstrained cost functions. The
simulated cost functions are compared, in conjunction with equations
(11') and (13), with observed measures of average q.

A.

Production Specification
For empirical purposes we assume that firms combine capital, labor,

energy (E) and materials (Fl) in a production function with constant

elasticity of substitution a.7 That is,

Y =

1/p

[aKK + a.i]

i=L,E,M,

(14)

where p=(a-1)/a and the a. are distribution parameters. The CES function
implies that per unit capital demand, as a function of input prices kt and

p, is

The demands for labor, energy and materials have a similar form. The

cost function for new capital is CktK+p1it.
The cost function associated with old input combinations is determined by the number and effectiveness of constraints on Input substitucion.
Obviously, we do not know the extent to which firms are constrained in

their ability to substitute inputs. We have assumed that all capital is

The cost function associated with old input combinations is determined by the number and effectiveness of constraints on input substitution.

Obviously, we do not know the extent to which firms are constrained in

their ability to substitute inputs. We have assumed that all capital is
putty-clay in order to obtain a lower bound on observed capital values.8
This assumption implies that equation (13) describes average q.

B.

The Data
Three sets of data are used to link relative factor price movement

to capital values. First, the production parameters found in equation
(14) are specified. Second, a time series of the K, L, E, and M input

prices are estimated. Finally, the X. from equation (13) are computed.
The production parameters required for equation (14) are the elas-

ticity of substitution a and a. distribution parameters. Berndt (1976)
finds that reliable time series estimates of a fall in the range 1.15 to

1.25. Therefore, a is set at 1.2. Cost shares are used as a proxy for
the a. distribution parameters. Cost share estimates are obtained from
industry specific input service cost data constructed by Fraumeni (1979).
Frauineni estimates the prices and quantities of capital, labor, energy

and material services, for thirty-six sectors, during the 1958-74 period.
Yearly cost shares are computed by aggregating the Fraumeni input service
cost data, then dividing each aggregate input cost by the total cost of
all inputs.

10

The price of capital is computed as a weighted sum of the prices of

structures and equipment. Data from Berndt and Christenson (1973)
suggest that the structures and equipment weights are 0.42 and 0.58.

The structures and equipment prices are updated and adjusted versions of
user cost of capital estimates made by Hendershott and Hu (1981).h1

12

adjusting total man-hours worked for changes in educational attainment
and intensity of effort.

Because Divisia price indexes for energy and materials are only
available on a limited basis, these prices are computed with data from

the Crude Materials Price Index. The price of materials is found by
deleting crude petroleum used for energy related products from the Crude

Non-Food Materials Less Fuel Index.'2 The price of energy is estimated
by adding crude petroleum used for energy related products to the Crude

Fuel Index.'3 One measure of the quality of our factor price proxies is
their correlation with the factor prices estimated by Fraumeni (1979).
The correlation coefficient of the energy price series is 0.96; that for
the two materials prices is 0.91.

Figure 2 plots our five real factor prices (recall that the price

of capital is an average of the equipment and structures prices). The
calculated real factor prices are more volatile after 1967 than before.
As expected, real energy prices rose dramatically during the 1970s.

However, the prices of structures, e .&rent and materials also fluctuated
significantly.

Expected real prices are computed by extrapolating current real

price growth rates into the future. A number of real price series were

constructed. The maximum decline of

is sensitive to the length of

time current price changes are assumed to continue into the future. If
the current rate of real price change is maintained for a relatively

short future period, then Q*

falls

by a relatively small amount (5-10%).

Conversely, if the current rate of change is extrapolated for a lengthy

period, Q* declines sharply (50—70%). A series which declines roughly
in line with the observed decline in 2 (see Figure 3 below) is obtained

when real prices are assumed to grow at the current real price growth
rate for four years, at one-half of the current growth rate for the
following three years, and at one-fourth the current rate in the succeed-

ing three years.14 (Due to a two to three month reporting lag in aggregate
data, each current price is computed from data recorded for the previous
quarter.)

The

weights are calculated from capital stock and investment

series used in the Federal Reserve-MIT-Penn (FM?) econometric model.
The FM? investment series (expenditures for equipment and structures) is

taken directly from the NIA while the capital stock is interpolated from

annual stocks computed by the BEA. The economic service lives of equipment and structures are assumed to equal sixteen years and fifty years.
Two problems must be resolved before equation (13) can be estimated.

First, the economic lifetimes of equipment and structures imply that a
significant portion of the factor price sample is required to initially

specify Q*. Indeed, the fifty year effective lifetime of structures is
longer than our time series of expected factor prices. Thus, it is
never possible for the entire capital stock to be represented in (13).

A second problem is that the single-period capital price

decline with j. Because Q is a weighted sum of the

tends to

Q* is

negatively related to the maximum lag length. Therefore, the maximum
lag length must be held constant for the entire Q* time series in order
to avoid a bias that changes over time.

To finesse the above problems, we assume that the value of the most
recent ten years of capital stock is a constant proportion of the value

of all capital. As a result, a ten-year sample of expected factor
prices may be used to compute an estimate of

that is proportional

15

to, but typically greater than, observed capital prices because the
component

tend to decline with j. For the assumed depreciation

rates, approximately 58% of the outstanding capital stock is represented

in Q*. The first quarter that all expected factor prices are available
is 1954:1; thus the first estimate of

is for 1964:1.

III. EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS

The aggregate average q, Q*, is calculated by combining equations
(11') and (13) with the above described data and an estimate of N. An

estimate of N is inferred from equation (5). We assume t0.48, d0.08,
r0.07 and that an investor purchases $1.00 of capital when all factor
prices are unity. The input demands described in equation (15) are used

to calculate C03.2. Thus, N0.09.
Figure 3 plots the simulated

and three estimates of average

Tobin's q. The average q estimates include two series computed with
yearly data [President of the U.S. (1983), Holland and Myers (1980)] and

one with quarterly data [von Furstenberg (1977)1.15 The yearly data are
plotted in the second quarter of each year.

Significant differences exist between the absolute magnitudes of

alternative estimates of average q. For example, von Furstenberg's q is
similar to Q*, but both are far less than the yearly q estimates.
However, our interest is with the movement of q over time, especially
during the 1970s, and the overall trend of

is very similar to the

trend of the three average q estimates. All estimates are relatively
high during the 1960s, decline and rise during the early 1970s, then

decline throughout most of the middle and late 1970s. The vintage
capital price Q* was relatively stable from 1963 to 1973, declined

sharply in 1974, rose in 1975, then declined from 1976 on. The trend of
after the early 1970s is especially similar to the trend of the
three average q estimates.

Alternative simulations of average q (not shown here) had a trend

similar to the Figure 3 estimate. All series peaked during the 1966-1968
period, declined and rebounded between 1973 and 1975, then declined

thereafter. As noted above, the final decline was larger the further

most

responsible for the downward trend was materials prices. Energy

prices had very little effect on trend due to the small share of energy

in total cost (see footnote 10). This result is consistent with Bruno's
(1984) finding that unexpected increases in real materials prices caused
the productivity slowdown.

The statistical relation between Q* and an estimate of average q

is found by regressing von Furstenberg's q (VQ) on Q*. The OLS estimate
is:

We

conclude that relative factor price movements may have been the primary
determinant of the observed decline of average q.

CONCLUSION

This paper has developed and tested an hypothesis regarding the
determination of average Tobin's q, namely that unanticipated relative
factor price changes caused previously optimal outstanding capital

Because estimates of five real factor prices were relatively
constant prior to 1973 and then increased sharply in volatility, our
simulated average q is relatively constant prior to 1973 and then declines

dramatically. With extrapolative price expectations, the decline parallels
the movement in previous estimates of Tobin's q. Materials, rather than
energy, price changes are the prime cause of the decline. A simple
regression confirms the comparability of the declines in von Furstenberg's
q and our simulated value.

FOOTNOTES

1Tobins's q is defined as the market value of a firm's liabilities
divided by the replacement cost of it's assets. The variable has traditionally been used as a tool of investment theory [Brainard and Tobin
(1968), Yoshikawa (1980), Hayashi (1982), Fischer and Merton (1984)].
More recent work has utilized q as a link between the theory of finance
and such diverse topics as production theory [Berndt and Fuss (1982)],
industrial organization [Lindenberg and Ross (1981), Lustgarten and
Thomadakis (1983)) and taxes [Feldstein (1981)].

2Continuity is a convenient assumption because it allows us to consider very small changes in factor prices. One alternative would be to
assume that output is produced by a series of activities of the form
Y =
Y

mm

(K/aK, L/aL)

mm (K/bK, L/bL)

where a., b., ... are constants. In this case, firms produce Y with the

cheapest achvity, i.e., the input demands are corner solutions. If
relative factor prices change, then firms switch to new activities in a
discrete fashion.
3See Bischoff (1971) or Ando et al. (1975) for examples of the use
of this assumption.
4An example will illustrate the methodology used to estimate replacement cost. In March 1974 the base sticker price of a Cadillac, Sedan
De Ville was $7,885, whereas six years later it was $13,282. All estimates
of replacement cost assume that the 1980 replacement cost of an undepreciated 1974 Cadillac is $13,282. No replacement cost estimate adjusts
for the fact that the 1980 Cadillac combines inputs in a very different
fashion than the 1974 Cadillac.
In actual practice, an aggregate price index would be used to inflate
the 1974 Cadillac price. Different aggregate price indexes necessarily
lead to different 1980 replacement cost estimates. Salinger and Summers
(1983) would use the CPI, Lindenberg and Ross (1981) would employ the GNP
deflator while the BEA would apply a deflator that relates to a class
of investments that includes Cadillacs.
5The relation between C and C1 can be seen by comparing the respective cost—minimization problems. Because (7) is a constrained form
of (2), solving (2) is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for the
solution of (7). Therefore, the unconstrained cost C1 is never greater
than the constrained cost C. The minimum difference, C-C1O, occurs
when the constraint K=K0 is 'tjust" binding, i.e., when K1K1.
The LeChatelier principle predicts the above results by suggesting
that constraints on a system that is minimizing (maximizing) some objective function can only raise (lower) the value of the function. The fact
that V'<V is a consequence of the addition of constraints on input substitution.

20

6 inverse relation between q* and (w1-w0)2 implies that a
standard variance measure may be uses as a proxy for q. In particular,
variance indexes used to measure relative output price variation [Fischer
(1981), Parks (1978)] may also be used to link average q to relative
factor price variation [Elmer (1983)].
7The CES function is convenient due to the availability of relevant
parameter estimates [Berndt (1976)]. Bruno (1984) uses a similar form.
8The assumption that old capital is pure clay represents the most
restrictive possible case. Therefore, the assumption induces a downward
bias in our simulated capital values (see Figure 3).
However, the pure clay capital model is justified by at least three
arguments. First, the choice of any particular subset of input substitution constraints is arbitrary. That is, we have no way of determining
which of an infinity of possible constraints is most appropriate. Second,
by simulating the most restrictive possible case, we estimate a lower bound
to observed capital values. This implies that more realistic capital price
estimates can be obtained by computing a weighted average of the simulated
capital prices and unity. Finally, the downward bias acts to offset an
upward bias that arises from measurement error (discussed below).

It is clear that significant differences exist between the two estimates.
For example, the Berndt-Wood capital share is one-fourth the size of Elmer's
capital share and has an absolute magnitude of only 0.053. The ElmerFraumeni estimates are computed from a more detailed up-to-date data base
than the Berndt-Wood estimates.
complete description of the factor prices is found in Elmer (1983),
Chapter 4.

During the 1970-74 period, approximately 13, of total crude pe-

troleum was used for non-energy related products [OECD Statistics of
Energy (1975)]. Therefore, crude petroleum used for energy related product is estimated as 87% of the crude petroleum component of the Crude
Non-Food Materials Less Fuel Index.

Removing crude petroleum from the Crude Non-Food Materials Less
Fuel Index, then adding it to the Crude Fuel Index, required information
on the relative importance of crude petroleum in each index. The Bureau
of Labor Statistics has published relative importance data for the years
1957, 1960, 1966 and 1969-present. Our series assumes that the relative
importance of crude petroleum figures remained constant prior to 1957 and
interpolates for the periods 1958-59, 1961-66 and 1967-68.
141f the current average relative factor price is 1.0 and the current
quarterly growth rate is 0.91, the expected relative price for next quarter
1

would be 1.01 ,

price expected 17 quarters hence is 1.01

16.5 and the

price expected 29 quarters out is 1.0122.25.
15The von Furstenberg q estimates are a revised and updated version
of the original series. We wish to thank George von Furstenberg for
supplying these data.
16The presence of inventories among corporate assets makes the estimated coefficient on Q** even more acceptable. If the inventory/capital
ratio is stable, then he Q* coefficient will be less than unity by the
ratio of inventories to inventories plus capital. This ratio was stable
from 1960 to 1980 and approximately equal to 0.2. Therefore, the
coefficient is expected to equal 0.8.
