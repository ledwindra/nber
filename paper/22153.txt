Corporate Resilience to Banking Crises: The Roles of Trust and Trade Credit

NBER Working Paper No. 22153
April 2016
JEL No. D22,G01,G21,G32,Z13
ABSTRACT
Are firms more resilient to systemic banking crises in economies with higher levels of social
trust? Using firm-level data in 34 countries from 1990 through 2011, we find that
liquidity-dependent firms in high-trust countries obtain more trade credit and suffer smaller drops
in profits and employment during banking crises than similar firms in low-trust economies. The
results are consistent with the view that when banking crises block the normal bankinglending channel, greater social trust facilitates access to informal finance, cushioning the effects
of these crises on corporate profits and employment.

1. Introduction
Systemic banking crises are costly, common, and heavily researched. Boyd, Kwak, and
Smith (2005), Kroszner, Laeven, and Klingebiel (2007), Claessens, Tong, and Wei (2012), and
others show that banking crises shrink output and employment. Reinhardt and Rogoff (2009)
document the ubiquitousness of financial crises throughout history, and Laeven and Valencia
(2012) find that most countries experienced a systemic banking crisis between 1970 and 2011.
Unsurprisingly, therefore, an enormous literature examines the causes of banking crises (e.g., see,
recent reviews by Allen and Gale, 2009 and Laeven, 2011).
What has received less attention is the resilience of firms—and hence economies—to
systemic banking crises. While many countries experience crises, not all experience similar
reductions in output and employment. Levine, Lin, and Xie (2016) show that well-developed
stock markets mitigate the adverse effects of banking crises by providing an alternative source of
financing when crises curtail the flow of bank credit to firms. But, other factors might also shape
the ability of firms to obtain financing during systemic banking crises.
In this paper, we examine whether social trust affects (a) the ability of firms to obtain
financing through informal channels when crises reduce the flow of bank loans to firms and (b)
the resilience of corporate profits and employment to systemic banking crises. As defined by
Fukuyama (1995, p. 27) and Putnam (2000, p. 19), social trust means the expectations within a
community that people will behave in honest and cooperative ways and the extent to which
human interactions are governed by the norms of reciprocity and trustworthiness. By informal
finance, we mean credit provision that occurs beyond the scope of a country’s formal financial
and regulatory institutions. For example, firms often receive trade credit that does not involve
collateral or promissory notes subject to formal judicial enforcement mechanisms (Ayyagari,
Demirgüç-Kunt, and Maksimovic, 2010). Trade credit represents a large proportion of debt
financing, accounting for 25% of the average firm’s total debt liabilities in our sample of over
3500 firms across 34 countries from 1990 to 2011.

Existing research suggests how social trust could enhance corporate resilience to
systemic banking crises. First, when a systemic banking crisis impedes the normal bank-lending
channel, access to trade credit could partially offset the reduction in bank loans and ameliorate
the impact of the crisis on corporate profits and employment. Indeed, Garcia-Appendini and
Montoriol-Garriga (2013) show that the 2007-2008 banking crisis triggered a surge in betweenfirm liquidity provision. Second, social trust could facilitate access to trade credit during a
banking crisis. Karlan (2005) shows that people who view their communities as more
trustworthy are more likely to lend money and payback loans even when there are no formal
enforcement mechanisms in place. While firms might prefer bank loans (Ayyagari, DemirgüçKunt, and Maksimovic, 2010), high social trust can increase firms’ access to trade credit when
bank loans are unavailable (Allen, Qian, and Qian, 2005).
Using a difference-in-differences methodology, we first assess the relation between social
trust and firms’ use of trade credit, profitability, and employment during systemic banking crises.
We use a sample of about 3,600 manufacturing firms across 34 countries over the years from
1990 through 2011. Data on trade credit received, profitability, employment, and other firm-level
information come from Worldscope. Our key explanatory variable is the interaction term
between a measure of social trust (Trust) and a crisis dummy that equals one in the start-year of a
systemic banking crisis and remains one for the three years after the crisis (Crisis). To date
systemic banking crises, we rely on Laeven and Valencia (2012). To measure social trust, we
follow previous studies (e.g., La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer, and Vishny, 1997a; Guiso,
Sapienza and Zingales, 2008) and compute the percentage of survey respondents who answer
“most people can be trusted” in response to the question in World Values Survey (WVS),
“Generally speaking, would you say that most people can be trusted, or that you can’t be too
careful in dealing with people?”. We measure Trust three years before the start of a country’s
systemic banking crisis. We interpret greater values of the trust measure as suggesting that
suppliers of trade credit are more confident about the trustworthiness of the demanders of such
credit. If the key interaction term—Trust*Crisis—enters positively, this suggests that, on average,
2

social trust mitigates the fall in trade credit financing, firm profitability, and firm employment
during systemic banking crises.
We then explore whether the relation between social trust and firm trade credit, profits,
and employment differs across industries in a theoretically predictable manner. In particular,
since trade credit is a closer substitute for a firm’s short-run liquidity needs than it is for longterm capital investments (Klapper, Laeven, and Rajan, 2012), the resilience-enhancing effects of
social trust should be greatest among firms that depend heavily on liquid funds. Thus, we not
only assess whether corporations are more resilient to banking crises in higher-trust countries, we
examine differences in the cross-industry resilience to such crises. To measure an industry’s
short-run liquidity needs, we follow Raddatz (2006) and use the proportion of working capital
financed by ongoing sales, so that higher values indicate greater dependence on short-run
liquidity.
The empirical findings are consistent with the predictions that (1) social trust facilitates
access to trade credit during systemic banking crises, (2) social trust dampens the harmful effects
of the crisis on firm profits and employment, and (3) the resilience-enhancing effects of social
trust are largest among firms that rely heavily on liquidity funds. The analyses control for both
firm fixed effects to condition out all time-invariant, firm-specific features that might account for
a firm’s resilience to a banking crisis and year effects to control for the evolution of corporate
performance, access to trade credit, and resilience to shocks. The regressions also control for an
assortment of time-varying and firm characteristics discussed below. We discover that firms in
higher-trust countries receive more trade credit financing and suffer smaller reductions in profits
and employment than firms in lower-trust countries during systemic banking crises. Moreover,
the relation between social trust and trade credit, profitability, and employment is more
pronounced among industries that depend heavily on external liquidity provision. The evidence
is consistent with the view that social trust improves the resiliency of firms to banking crises.
The connections between social trust and corporate financing, profits, and employment
are economically meaningful. Consider a hypothetical “average” country that has the sample
3

average value of social trust (0.328), and a “high-trust” country, where its Trust value is one
standard deviation higher than the sample average (0.496), and set the other country
characteristics constant at their sample average values for both hypothetical countries. The
coefficient estimates from our baseline regressions suggest that in liquidity dependent firms,
trade credit financing drops by 43% less in the high-trust country than it falls in the average
country during a systemic banking crisis. In terms of firm performance and employment, the
coefficient estimates indicate that corporate profits drop by 52% less and firm employment drops
by 18% less in the high-trust country than they drop in the average country during a crisis.
We address several potential challenges to identifying the impact of social trust on
corporate resilience to banking crises. First, if social trust shapes the size of systemic banking
crises, then our findings might reflect differences in the severity of crises, not the resilience of
firms to similarly-sized banking crises. Our analyses, however, suggest that the results do not
simply reflect the impact of social trust on crisis size. In particular, trust does not explain crosscountry differences in the sizes of banking crises, as measured by the reduction of bank credit.
Moreover, all of the results in the paper hold when controlling for the size of the banking crisis,
or other features of the economy that could account for differences in the severity of the crisis,
such as the size of banks, the level of stock market development, and the overall level of legal
and institutional development.
Second, social trust could be correlated with variables that account for differences in
corporate performance following banking crises. For example, if social trust is highly correlated
with economic development, bank and stock market development, the degree to which the
formal legal system protects creditors and shareholders, the effectiveness of the legal system in
enforcing contracts, and the overall level of institutional development, this could hinder our
ability to draw sharp inferences about social trust. Consequently, our baseline regressions control
for the interaction between the crisis dummy variable and (a) Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per
capita, (b) the size of the financial intermediary sector, (c) stock market capitalization as a share
of GDP, (d) the contraction of bank credit during the crisis, (e) the legal rights of creditors, and (f)
4

the legal protection of minority shareholders. Furthermore, we extend these analyses and also
control for the interaction between the crisis dummy and (1) a measure of the rule of law that
corresponds to the extent to which agents have confidence in the operation of the formal
mechanisms for enforcing laws and contracts and (2) a measure of overall institutional quality
that equals the first principle component of property rights, voice of accountability, political
stability and absence of violence, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of law, and
control of corruption. When controlling for all of these interaction terms, firm and year fixed
effects, and time-varying firm traits, such as firm size, long-term debt, and Tobin’s Q, we
continue to find that social trust has a statistically significant and economically large association
with corporate resilience to banking crises in liquidity dependent industries. This is consistent
with existing research suggesting that trade credit relies more on social trust (e.g., Allen, Qian,
and Qian, 2005, and Ayyagari, Demirgüç-Kunt, and Maksimovic, 2010), whereas formal
financial arrangements rely more on legal institutions (e.g., La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer,
and Vishny, 1997b, 1998).
A third challenge to identifying the impact of social trust on corporate resilience to
banking crises involves differential trends across countries, industries, and firms. Specifically,
firms in high trust countries might have different trends in performance from those in low trust
countries, firms in high liquidity dependent industries might have different trends in performance
from those in low liquidity dependent industries in the same country, and firms in high (and low)
liquidity dependent industries in high trust countries might have different trends in firm
performance from corresponding firms in low trust countries. We address these concerns by
adding to the explanatory variables described above (a) country-level time trends for 34
countries in our sample to account for potential differences in time trends across countries, (b)
country-industry time trends for 1151 country-industry pairs to account for potential differences
in time trends across industries in different countries, or (c) firm-level time trends for 3603
sample firms to control for potential differences in time trends across individual firms. The core
results hold.

This study relates to several strands of research. First, it complements a large number of
studies of how social trust, and social capital more generally, influence economic behavior.
Glaeser et al. (2000) discover that an individual’s broad views of trust, as garnered from
attitudinal surveys, predict trustworthy behavior within experimental settings. Karlan (2005)
shows that attitudes towards trust influence an individual’s willingness to lend based on the
trustworthiness of the borrower and to repay loans even when such loans are not enforceable in
court. More broadly, Guiso, Sapienza and Zingales (2004, 2008) find that trust improves the
operation of national financial systems. And, more broadly still, Knack and Keefer (1997) show
that social trust is associated with faster economic growth, while La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes,
Shleifer, and Vishny (1997a) document the link between trust and corporate performance. Our
paper shows that social trust influences corporate resilience to systemic banking crises.
Second, our study helps reconcile the mixed findings on the relation between trade and
bank credit. In a study of the recent U.S. financial crisis, Garcia-Appendini and MontoriolGarriga (2013) show that nonfinancial firms extend substantial trade credit to their customers
when bank credit is scarce. However, in a study of six emerging economies that experienced
banking crises, Love, Preve, and Sarria-Allende (2007) find that trade credit does not
compensate much for the contraction in bank credit due to crises. Focusing on the financing
patterns of 48 countries in 1999, Beck, Demirgüç-Kunt, and Maksimovic (2008) show that while
firms that are financially constrained can partially substitute trade for bank finance, the
availability of trade credit is more limited in developing economies. Our findings suggest that
cross-country differences in social trust shape cross-country differences in the degree to which
firms substitute trade credit for bank credit during banking crises.
Third, our findings add to a growing literature on finance and employment. By allocating
resources efficiently, well-developed financial markets can improve labor markets (Pagano and
Volpin, 2008; Beck, Levine, and Levkov, 2010). Our findings suggest that social trust helps
mitigate the impact of banking crises on unemployment by making it easier for firms to access
alternative, informal sources of financing.

The rest of this paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 defines the data, Section 3 describes
the empirical methodology, Section 4 presents the empirical results on social trust and financing
during systemic banking crises, Section 5 gives the results on trust and firm profits and
employment during crises, and Section 6 concludes.

2. Data
2.1 Sample
Our initial sample begins with the 65 countries that both have data on social trust in the
World Values Survey and experienced at least one systemic banking crisis during the period from
1990 through 2011 according to Laeven and Valencia (2012). For this initial sample, we obtain
firm-level data from the Worldscope database by Thomson Reuters. We then further restrict the
sample of countries and firms based on the following criteria. First, we focus on publicly listed
firms in manufacturing industries (U.S. Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code between
2000 – 3999). Second, a firm needs to have complete financial information in the Worldscope
database over the seven-year crisis window, [t-3, t+3], where t equals the start year of a systemic
crisis as defined by Laeven and Valencia (2012). Third, we eliminate observations with negative
assets, negative book equity, or negative cost of goods sold. Fourth, a country needs to have at
least three firms with complete information. Fifth, a country must be covered in (a) Djankov, La
Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, and Shleifer (2008), so that we have information on shareholder
protection laws, and in (b) Djankov, McLiesh, and Shleifer (2007), so that we have information
on the creditor protection laws. Finally, we exclude firms in the U.S. from our analyses because
we rely on the U.S. firms to benchmark industries.
These selection criteria yield a sample of over 3500 firms across 34 countries over the
period from 1990 through 2011. In total, the sample contains over 22,500 firm-year observations.
The average firm in our sample has six years of data. Appendix Table A1 describes all of
variables in detail.

2.2 Social trust measure
The World Values Survey (WVS) aims to measure the “beliefs, values, and motivations
of people” across countries and has been widely used in prior studies to capture cross-country
variations in trust (e.g., Knack and Keefer, 1997; La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer, and
Vishny, 1997a). From the WVS, we use the answer to the following to measure trust.
“Generally speaking, would you say that most people can be trusted, or that you
can’t be too careful in dealing with people?”
The WVS offers three possible responses: (1) most people can be trusted; (2) you can’t be too
careful in dealing with other people; and (3) I don’t know. Following La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes,
Shleifer, and Vishny (1997a) and Guiso, Sapienza, and Zingales (2008), we calculate Trust
within a country as the percentage of respondents who reply that most people can be trusted.
We use the pre-crisis measure of trust in each country. Given that WVS was conducted
close to every other year since 1990, we use Trust in period t-3, where t represents the start year
of a banking crisis in the country, or in closest, previous period to t-3 based on data availability.
Summary statistics in Table 1 show that the average level of trust in our sample is 0.328 with a
standard deviation of 0.168. Denmark has the highest level of trust, 0.665, while Philippines and
Turkey have the lowest, 0.055 (see Table A2 in the Appendix).

2.3 Systemic banking crises
We use the database complied by Laeven and Valencia (2012) to determine the start year
of each crisis in a country. It is a comprehensive database of banking crisis episodes during the
period from 1970 through 2011 across more than 100 countries. They define the start year of a
systemic banking crisis as the first year when the overall banking system exhibits significant
symptoms of financial distress, including bank runs and bank liquidations, and when the
government intervenes in the banking sector in response to significant losses in the banking
sector. Importantly, the crises episodes based on Laeven and Valencia (2012) identify periods
with financial distress in the entire banking sector, as opposed to problems with individual banks.
8

For each crisis event, we focus on a seven-year window, [t-3, t+3], centered on the start
year of the crisis t, during which [t-3, t-1] is defined as the pre-crisis period and [t, t+3] is defined
as the crisis period. We define Crisis as a dummy variable that equals one if a country is in a
crisis period and zero during the pre-crisis period. Appendix Table A2 lists the start years of
systemic banking crises for the 34 countries. As shown, 18 countries suffered systemic crises
during the recent global financial crisis, and six had crises during the East Asian financial crisis.
Over the years from 1990 through 2011, all of the countries in our sample had one systemic
crisis except Argentina, which had two. In dating the two Argentine crises, we follow Kroszner,
Laeven, and Klingebiel (2007). The start years of the first and second banking crisis in Argentina
are 1995 and 2001 respectively. We define the pre-crisis period for both crises as [1992, 1994].
The crisis period for the first crisis is [1995, 1998], while it is [2001, 2004] for the second crisis.
The paper’s conclusions hold when excluding Argentina. Furthermore, we also conducted all of
the paper’s analyses using a narrower window [t-1, t+1]. All of the results hold.

2.4 Firm-level variables
Using data from Worldscope, we construct measures of trade credit. We begin with the
balance sheet item, Account payable, which equals the amount of good and services that a
purchasing firm receives from suppliers before paying for them. Account payable is not a formal
legal instrument, and the purchasing firm does not sign a promissory note. While Account
payable is a stock entry on the firm’s balance sheet, Trade credit financing equals the change in
Account payable during a particular time period. Trade credit financing is positive if the firm
receives more goods and services than it pays. Trade credit financing will be negative if the firm
not only pays for the goods and services that it receives but it also pays down at least some of the
stock of accounts payable.
Based on these components, we construct and examine two measures of trade credit: (1)
Trade credit financing/CoGS equals Trade credit financing divided by the cost of goods sold
(CoGS), during the period and (2) Trade credit financing/total assets equals Trade credit
9

financing divided by the book value of total assets at the beginning of period t. Table 1 provides
summary statistics for these variables. Trade credit financing/CoGS has a sample mean of 0.007
and a standard deviation of 0.076, meaning that the average increase in trade credit obtained
from the suppliers equals 0.7 percentage points of a firm’s cost of goods sold, with a
corresponding standard deviation of 7.6 percentage points.
Besides these informal financing measures, we also examine two measures of formal
financing. Following Baker, Stein, and Wurgler (2003), we infer the amount of new equity
issuance from a firm’s balance sheet items, and define Equity issuance as the change in the book
value of common equity plus the change in the deferred taxes minus the change in the retained
earnings during year t, scaled by the book value of total asset at the beginning of period t. Debt
issuance equals the change in the Total debt during a particular year t, scaled by total assets at
the beginning of year t. Total debt is the sum of short-term debt and long-term debt excluding
capitalized leases. Table 1 shows that Equity issuance ranges from -0.289 to 1.305 with a sample
mean of 0.031, and Debt issuance ranges from -0.232 to 0.618 with a sample mean of 0.021.
To assess firm performance, we consider both measures of operating profitability and
employment. EBIT equals the ratio of earnings before interest and tax during a period to the book
value of total assets at the start of the period. In robustness tests reported in Appendix Table A7,
we use two additional profitability indicators. Net income equals the ratio of earnings after
interest and taxes to the book value of total assets at the start of the period. We use Net income to
account for variations in interest and tax expenses across countries. The other measure of
profitability is Cash flow, which equals the ratio of net earnings plus depreciation and
amortization to the book value of assets at the start of the period. Cash flow helps address
concerns that differences in earnings management account for differences in the firm profitability
measures. Finally, Firm employment equals the natural logarithm of the total number of
employees in a firm. Since Worldscope provides employment data in units of 1,000, Firm
employment equals zero when a firm has 1,000 or fewer employees.

10

Table 1 shows that there is considerable variation in firm performance during banking
crises. The values of EBIT range from -0.527 to 0.493, with a sample mean of 0.057 and a
standard deviation of 0.12. The values of Firm employment range from 0 to 13 with a standard
deviation of 1.8, suggesting that the number of workers in our sample of firms ranges from one
thousand to over 500,000.
We use data on several other time-varying, firm-level characteristics in our analyses,
including firm size, long-term debt, and Tobin’s Q. Table A1 provides the definitions of these
variables, which we discuss when we present the analyses below. We winsorize all firm-level
financial variables at the 1% and 99% levels to reduce the impact of outliers.
Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the changes in trade credit financing, profits, and employment
during banking crises. The figures suggest that Trade credit financing/CoGS, EBIT, and Firm
employment drop less in countries with higher levels of Trust. First, for each firm, we calculate
the difference between (a) the outcome variable averaged over the crisis period, [t, t+3] and (b)
the outcome variable averaged over the pre-crisis period, [t-3, t-1], where t denotes the start year
of the country’s banking crisis. Then we average the differences across all of the firms within the
same country. Finally, we plot each country-level change against its pre-crisis level of trust. The
fitted line in Figure 1 is upward-sloping, suggesting that while the amount of new trade credit
that purchasers receive during banking crises falls in most countries (as the country averages for
the change in Trade credit financing/CoGS are mostly below zero), it falls less in countries with
higher levels of Trust, which, as defined above, is measured before the crisis. Similarly, Figure 2
exhibits an upward-sloping relationship between Trust and firm performance over banking crisis.
In particular, firm profits and firm employment tend to fall less during banking crises in
countries with higher Trust.

2.5 Industry-level liquidity needs measures
In most of our analyses, we seek to differentiate industries by the degree to which
technology shapes their reliance on external liquidity, such as trade credit. Industries that require
11

large amounts of working capital to finance their operations for technological reasons, such as
the length of the production process, the mode of production (batch vs. continuous), the
importance of smoothing investments over long periods, and the structure of the adjustment costs
associated with altering investment plans, tend to rely more heavily on the provision of external
liquidity. As argued by Raddatz (2006), among the different components of working capital,
inventories are a particularly suitable proxy for the technological demand for liquid funds.
Thus, our proxy for an industry’s technological reliance on trade credit, or more broadly
short-term liquidity, equals the ratio of inventories to sales and is calculated across U.S.
companies at the three-digit SIC industry level (Liquidity needs). 1 It measures the extent to
which inventories cannot be financed by current revenue, such that higher values of Liquidity
needs indicate a greater reliance on external liquidity. In using data from the United States to
create this proxy of the technological reliance of industries on external liquidity, we follow Rajan
and Zingales (1998) in assuming that U.S. financial markets and institutions are relatively
developed, so that the cross-industry differences in the external liquidity needs of U.S. industries
primarily reflect technological differences across industries in the demand for such funds.
Furthermore, using one country to benchmark the technological liquidity needs of industries is
advantageous because the liquidity needs of an industry may vary across countries due to
differences in capital market development. We thus use U.S. Liquidity needs as a proxy for the
technology-driven demand for trade credit across industries around the world.
For a country c that experienced a crisis starting in year t, we construct its Liquidity needs
using U.S. industry data over the period from t-10 through t-1. For instance, given that a
systemic banking crisis occurred in Japan in 1997, we use the U.S. data over the period of 1987 –
1996 to calculate the Liquidity needs of each industry in Japan. More specifically, for each U.S.
firm i within the ten-year window corresponding to crisis year t, we use Compustat to compute
the ratio of inventories to sales in each year and we then take the median value of this ratio over
1

We use Compustat to obtain financial data of the U.S. companies, and CRSP to collect information on the U.S.
Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) because CRSP provides time-varying data on the SIC of firms.

12

the ten-year window and call it Li. Next, we calculate the median value of Li across U.S. firms
with the same three-digit SIC code and call this value the Liquidity needs of that industry in
crisis country c. Thus, Liquidity needs (a) is time-invariant for each crisis country and (b) differs
across countries that experience systemic crises in different years.
In robustness tests reported in the Appendix, we consider two alternative proxies for an
industry’s technological dependence on external liquidity. First, we examine Inventories/CoGS,
which equals inventories divided by the cost of goods sold. Dividing inventories by the cost of
sales, as opposed to the revenue of sales, is a common indicator of inventory turnover. A higher
value of Inventories/CoGS suggests a lower speed of inventory turnover. With greater
inventories and slower turnover, companies typically need more liquid funds for working capital.
Second, we calculate for each industry the extent to which it uses trade credit. Ng, Smith, and
Smith (1999) show that trade credit tends to exhibit considerable variation across industries, but
little intertemporal variation within an industry, and Fisman and Love (2003) find a strong
industry-specific element to accessing trade credit. Thus, we construct Trade credit reliance as
the ratio of Accounts payable to Total debt. We calculate both Inventories/CoGS and Trade
credit reliance for industries in the crisis countries using the same procedure as in the
construction of Liquidity needs. Appendix Table A1 provides detailed descriptions on how we
construct these measures. We show that the results hold when using each of the three proxies for
an industry’s technological dependence on liquidity provision. We focus on Liquidity needs, i.e.,
Inventories/Sales, because it is the most direct proxy for firms’ dependence on liquid funds, as it
is defined as the proportion of inventories (or working capital more broadly) that are financed by
current sales.
Table 1 shows that there is considerable cross-industry variation in the three proxies for
an industry’s technological dependence on liquidity provision. The values of Liquidity needs
vary from 0.012 to 0.364. This range is similar to that reported in Raddatz (2006), where the
measure of liquidity needs is calculated using U.S. data over the 1980s. The other measure,
Inventories/CoGS, exhibits a similar magnitude of variation. Trade credit reliance has a
13

minimum value of 0.055 and a maximum value of 2.717. This means that the ratio of trade
payable to total debt ranges from 5.5% to 271.7%.
Figures 3 and 4 indicate that trade credit financing, firm profits, and firm employment fall
less during banking crises in high-trust countries than they fall in low-trust countries and this
difference is larger among industries with higher Liquidity needs. The figures plot the simple
changes in firm outcome variables while differentiating between countries with high and low
trust and between industries with high and low liquidity needs. For each firm, we calculate the
difference between the outcome variables (trade credit financing, earnings before interest and tax,
and employment, all scaled by the book value of total assets) averaged over the crisis period, [t,
t+3], and the corresponding pre-crisis period, [t-3, t-1]. We then average the differences across
firms in four groups: high (low) liquidity needs industries in countries with high trust, and high
(low) liquidity needs industries in countries with low trust. We classify a country into the high
(low) trust group if its level of trust lies above (below) the median value of the sample countries.
We classify an industry into the high (low) liquidity needs group if its measure of Liquidity needs
lies above (below) the median of the sample of industries. Figure 3 shows that among high
liquidity needs industries, Trade credit financing drops, on average, by 0.85% of total assets
during a banking crisis in high-trust countries and drops by 1.6% in low-trust countries. In
contrast, the difference in the drop in Trade credit financing/Total assets between high- and lowtrust countries is negligible when focusing on low liquidity needs industries. Figure 4 shows that
the changes in firm profits and employment during crises exhibit similar patterns, suggesting that
firm profits and employment among high-liquidity needs industries drop less in high-trust
countries.

2.6 Country controls
In assessing the association between social trust and firm outcomes, we control for timevarying country characteristics, such as macroeconomic conditions, financial development, and
investor protection laws and call these Macro controls. In the analyses, we interact each of these
14

controls with Crisis. First, to control for the possibility that firms in more developed economies
perform relatively better during a crisis, we use GDP per capita, which equals the natural
logarithm of GDP per capita measured three years before a country’s crisis, t-3. Second, we use
two variables to control for the development of financial intermediaries and markets. Financial
institutions development equals the private credit by banks and other financial institutions
divided by GDP. Stock market development equals stock market capitalization divided by GDP.
We use the values measured three years before the crisis. Third, we control for the size of a crisis,
by computing the contraction in the growth rate of credit. Specifically, Private credit contraction
equals the average annual growth rate of bank credit over the pre-crisis period, [t-3, t-1], minus
the minimum annual growth rate of bank credit over the crisis period, [t, t+3], where t is the start
year of a banking crisis. By definition, larger Private credit contraction means a greater
reduction in bank credit growth, and hence a more severe banking crisis. Fourth, we control for
two types of investor protection laws since investor protection laws might affect firm
performance during a banking crisis. Creditor rights is an index constructed by Djankov,
McLiesh, and Shleifer (2007) based on bankruptcy and reorganization laws across countries. It
measures the ability of creditors to voice their opinions, get repaid, and affect the process of
reorganizing delinquent corporations. The overall index ranges from zero to four, with higher
value indicating greater creditor power. Anti-self-dealing is an index constructed by Djankov, La
Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, and Shleifer (2008) to measure the extent to which minority
shareholders are protected by the law from being expropriated by corporate insiders via selfdealing transactions. The index ranges from zero to one, with larger value indicating that it is
more difficult for large shareholders to engage in self-dealing transactions. Appendix Table A1
provides additional details on these Macro controls, and Table 1 reports summary statistics. 2

2

In robustness tests, we control for additional country-level measures of the rule of law and institutional quality. We
discuss these below. Appendix Table A1 provides detailed variable definitions, and Table A2 lists these macro
variables by each country.

3. Empirical Methodology
To assess whether firms in countries with higher levels of social trust receive more
financing and perform better during a banking crisis than similar firms in other countries, we
begin with the following specification.

𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡 = 𝛼𝛼0 + 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 + 𝛼𝛼𝑡𝑡 + 𝜷𝜷 ∗ 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑐𝑐 ∗ 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡 + 𝜃𝜃 ∗ 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡 +
𝝋𝝋′ ∗ 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑐𝑐 ∗ 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡 + 𝜸𝜸′ ∗ 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡−1 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡 ,

(1)

where 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡 refers to either trade credit received, equity issued, debt issued,
profitability, or employment by firm 𝑖𝑖, in country 𝑐𝑐, during year 𝑡𝑡; 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 and 𝛼𝛼𝑡𝑡 are firm and year

fixed effects; and 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡−1 represents a set of time-varying firm characteristics (e.g., Firm size,

Long-term debt, and Tobin’s q). The variable of focus is 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑐𝑐 * 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡 , which is the
interaction of the social trust measure for country c and the systemic crisis dummy variable,

𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡 . Recall that 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡 equals one for country 𝑐𝑐 in years t through t+3 and zero otherwise,

where t is the start-year of the systemic banking crisis. The estimated coefficient on the
interaction between 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑐𝑐 and 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡 , 𝛽𝛽, measures the differential outcome during a crisis of

firms operating in countries with different levels of social trust. The error term is denoted as 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡 .
We employ ordinary least squares (OLS) to estimate the coefficients in equation (1).

Heteroskedasticity robust standard errors are clustered at the country level. Our results hold
when using two-way clustering at the country and year levels, as shown in Appendix Table A4.
In equation (1), we control for several factors to better isolate the independent association
between social trust and firm outcomes. We allow firm outcomes during crises to vary by (a) the
level of economic development, (b) the level of development of financial intermediaries, (c) the
size of national stock exchanges, (d) the size of the banking crisis, (e) the degree to which the
legal system protects small investors from self-dealing by corporate insiders, and (f) the strength
of the legal rights of creditors. Thus, equation (1) includes the interactions between 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡 and

a vector of macro-country variables, which we call 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑐𝑐 , where 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑐𝑐 includes GDP per

16

capita, Financial institutions development, Stock market development, Private credit contraction,
Anti-self-dealing, and Creditor rights. These macro-country variables, except Private credit
contraction and Anti-self-dealing, are measured at t-3.
We then build on equation (1) to assess additional implications of the view that social
trust increases corporate resilience to systemic banking crises. According to this view, social
trust will exert a disproportionately positive impact on firms that—for technological reasons—
rely comparatively heavily on liquid funds. To test this prediction, we first divide industries into
those that depend heavily on liquidity for technological reasons and those that are less reliant on
liquidity. We then evaluate whether firms in industries that depend heavily on liquidity perform
comparatively better in countries with high levels of social trust during crises than similar firms
in countries with lower levels of social trust and whether firms in liquidity-dependent industries
perform comparatively better than other firms in the same country. As described in the data
section above, we distinguish industries by their natural degree of dependence on short-term
liquidity (or trade credit) using three measures that all use the U.S. to benchmark industries.
Specifically, we use (a) Liquidity needs, which equals the ratio of inventories to sales among U.S.
firms in each industry, (b) Inventories/CoGS, which equals the ratio of inventories to cost of
goods sold among U.S. firms in each industry, and (c) Trade credit reliance, which equals the
ratio of accounts payable to total debt among U.S. firms in each industry.
We address several challenges to identifying the impact of social trust on corporate
resilience to systemic banking crises. First, we were concerned that social trust might be
correlated with the size of banking crises. If this were the case, then our analyses might capture
differences in the severity of crises, not the resilience of firms to crises of similar sizes. As
reported in Appendix Table A3, however, there is not a statistically significant relation between
banking crisis size (Private credit contraction) and Trust. Moreover, as noted above, our
analyses control for country fixed effects and the interaction between Private credit contraction
and Crisis to condition out differences in the size of banking crises.

17

Second, to address the concern that our findings on corporate resilience to banking crises
reflect other features of economies besides social trust, we do the following. In addition to
controlling for firm and year fixed effects and an assortment of time-varying firm characteristics,
we control for the interaction between social trust and measures of the size of the crisis,
economic development, bank and stock market development, the degree to which the formal
legal system protects creditors and shareholders, the effectiveness of the legal system in
enforcing contracts, and the overall level of institutional development. Additionally, we augment
these analyses and further difference by industry. We assess the differential response of high and
low liquidity needs industries to systemic crises in economies with different levels of social trust.
In this way, we evaluate narrower, industry-specific predictions about the mechanisms through
which social trust shapes corporate resilience to crises.
A third challenge to our identification strategy is pre-trends. We were concerned that
there might be trends in corporate profits, employment, and trade credit that vary systematically
across high and low trust countries and that even vary systematically across industries in high
and low trust economies. To address this we conduct three additional tests. First, we include
𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑐𝑐 * 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 into Equation (1), where 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑐𝑐 represents a vector of 34 country dummy

variables, and 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 is a time trend indicator that equals one in t-3, two in t-2, … and seven in
t+3. Second, we include 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶_𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑐𝑐,𝑗𝑗 * 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 , where 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶_𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑐𝑐,𝑗𝑗

represents a vector of 1151 country-industry dummies at the three-digit SIC level. These
interaction terms account both for different trends across industries within the same country and
for different trends between industries with the same SIC code across different countries. Third,
we include 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖 * 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇, where 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖 is a set of 3603 individual firm dummies. These

additional terms remove differential trends across individual firms.

4. Trust and Financing during Banking Crises
Table 2 reports regression results evaluating whether social trust facilitates trade credit
financing when an economy experiences a systemic banking crisis. We use two measures of
18

trade credit. In columns (1) – (3), the dependent variable is changes in trade credit received
relative to the cost of goods sold (Trade credit financing/CoGS), while the dependent variable in
columns (4) – (6) is the ratio of changes in trade credit received to total assets (Trade credit
financing/Total assets). For both measures of trade credit, Table 2 provides results on the full
sample firms, on the subsample of firms with above the median value of Liquidity needs (High
Liquidity needs), and on the subsample of firms with below the median value of Liquidity needs
(Low Liquidity needs). The variable of interest is the interaction term, Trust*Crisis, which
captures the extent to which social trust facilitates trade credit when bank credit contracts during
a crisis.
The results are consistent with the view that social trust improves firms’ access to trade
finance during systemic banking crises. Specifically, columns (2) and (5) of Table 2 show that (a)
the coefficient on Trust*Crisis is positive and statistically significant at the 1% level among
firms in industries that rely heavily on trade credit for technological reasons, i.e., in High
Liquidity needs industries, and (b) this positive association between social trust and trade credit
financing during crises holds when using either measure of trade credit (Trade credit
financing/CoGS and Trade credit financing/Total assets). Furthermore, and consistent with
theory, columns (3) and (6) show that Trust*Crisis enters insignificantly among firms in Low
Liquidity needs industries. Moreover, the difference in the coefficients on Trust*Crisis between
the High- and Low-Liquidity-needs groups is statistically significant at least at the 5% level as
shown at the bottom of the table.
The economic magnitudes are meaningful. To see this, consider a hypothetical “average”
country with the sample average value of Trust (0.328), and a hypothetical “high-trust” country
with a value of Trust that is one standard deviation higher than the average (0.496=0.328+0.168).
Furthermore, hold everything constant about these countries. The coefficient estimates reported
in column (2) indicate that a banking crisis is associated with a reduction in trade credit financing
among High liquidity needs firms of 1.4% of the firms’ cost of goods sold for the average

19

country, and a reduction of only 0.8% among comparable firms in high-trust countries. 3 Thus,
among firms in industries that depend heavily on liquid funds, those in the high-trust country
experience a 43% (= (0.8-1.4)/1.4) smaller contraction in trade credit than those in the average
country during a systemic banking crisis. These results are robust to using the alternative
measure of trade credit (Trade credit financing/Total assets). We find that both the statistical
significance and the economic magnitudes of the estimated effects are very similar when using
Trade credit financing/Total assets.
The results are robust to controlling for other factors. There might be concerns that the
impact of a systemic crisis on the economy, including on the provision of trade credit, could
reflect other features of the economy, such as the level of economic development, the size of
financial institutions, the development stock markets, and the degree to which the legal system
protects creditors and small shareholders. Thus, the regressions control for the interaction
between the Crisis dummy and GDP per capita, Financial institutions development, Stock
market development, Creditor rights index, and Anti-self-dealing index. As shown in Table 2, the
results hold when conditioning on these country characteristics. We were also concerned that
social trust might influence the size of banking crises, which would confound our ability to
assess the impact of social trust on trade credit. Thus, we also include the interaction between
Crisis and Private credit contraction. Again, the results on the response of trade credit to a
systemic crisis are robust to controlling for the contraction in bank credit, further emphasizing
the positive connection between trust and trade credit following systemic banking crises.
The results are also robust to using two alternative proxies for the liquidity dependence of
industries. The first alternative proxy is Inventories/CoGS, which differs from Liquidity needs in
3

We calculate this figure using the coefficient estimates from column (2) in Table 2, and the corresponding sample
means in Table 1. For the high liquidity needs industries, the trade credit financing received from suppliers falls by
1.4% of the CoGS in the hypothetical ‘average’ country [-0.01435 = (0.0369*0.328) – 0.0012 – (0.00321*9.211) –
(0.0121*0.807) + (0.00858*0.579) + (0.00111*0.287) + (0.00448*0.440) + (0.00331*2.059)], and by 0.8% of the
CoGS in the ‘high-trust’ country [-0.008157 = (0.0369*0.496) – 0.0012 – (0.00321*9.211) – (0.0121*0.807) +
(0.00858*0.579) + (0.00111*0.287) + (0.00448*0.440) + (0.00331*2.059)]. Thus, firms in the high-trust country
experience a 43% (= (1.4-0.8)/1.4) smaller drop in trade credit financing than those in the average country over a
banking crisis.

20

that it scales inventories by the cost of goods sold rather than by sales. The second alternative is
Trade credit reliance, which equals accounts payable divided by total debt. The analyses in
Appendix Table A5 are similar to those in Table 2, except that Table A5 partitions by high and
low values of Inventories/CoGS in columns (1) – (2) and by high and low values of Trade credit
reliance in columns (3) – (4). As shown, we continue to find that firms in liquidity dependent
industries receive considerably more trade credit during banking crises in high-trust countries
than comparable firms in low-trust countries. That is, Trust*Crisis, enters positively and
significantly among liquidity dependent firms, but insignificantly among firms that depend less
on external liquidity for their operations. These results are consistent with the view that social
trust facilitates the provision of trade credit when there is a contraction in bank credit during
systemic crises.
We were concerned that Trust might be correlated with the quality of formal legal,
regulatory, and political institutions, which might confound our ability to identify the impact of
social trust on corporate resilience. To address this concern, we control for the interaction
between Crisis and the Rule of law and Institutional quality in Table 3. Rule of law measures the
extent to which agents have confidence in and abide by the rules of society, particularly the
enforcement quality of private and official contracts. Institutional quality is an index that
aggregates information on (a) the legal protection of private property, (b) the freedom of speech
and accountability of government officials, (c) political stability, (d) government effectiveness,
(e) the ability of the government to implement regulatory policies, (f) the Rule of law, and (g) the
extent to which institutions control corruption. Similar to Table 2, Table 3 splits the sample
based on the median value of industrial Liquidity needs.
Table 3 shows that after controlling for the quality of formal institutions, all of the results
hold. The coefficients on Trust*Crisis in the high Liquidity needs industry group remain
statistically significant and economically meaningful after controlling for these additional
interactions, whereas those in the low Liquidity needs industry group remain insignificant.
Moreover, the estimated coefficients for the high Liquidity needs industry group do not fall when
21

controlling for institutional quality. These results are consistent with our conjecture that it is the
mutual trust between firms, not the rule of law or the quality of institutions, that plays a
significant role in facilitating trade credit as a substitute to bank credit during a crisis. 4
We were also concerned that (1) firms in high trust countries might have different time
trends in trade credit from those in low trust countries, (2) firms in high liquidity dependent
industries might have different trends in trade credit from those in low liquidity dependent
industries in the same country, and (3) firms in high (and low) liquidity dependent industries in
high trust countries might have different trends in this alternative financing from corresponding
firms in low trust countries. To address these concerns, we include Trends interacted with (a) 34
country dummies, (b) 1151 country-industry dummies, or (c) 3603 individual firm dummies. By
adding these additional trend controls, we explicitly account for the preexisting time trends
across countries, country-industries, and firms.
As shown in Table 4, the results hold when accounting for these different trends.
Columns (1), (4), and (7) indicate that Trust*Crisis enters positively and statistically in the trade
credit financing regression after controlling for individual country, country-industry, or firm
trends, respectively, and while continuing to control for firm and year fixed effects as well as the
time-varying macro interaction and firm controls. Moreover, when we partition the overall
sample into high and low liquidity needs industries and control for individual country/countryindustry/firm trends, the results indicate that the resilience-enhancing effects of social trust on
trade credit are more profound among industries that depend heavily on short-term liquidity.
These results are fully consistent with the main findings in Table 2. While Table 4 uses Trade
credit financing/CoGS as the dependent variable throughout the columns, all the results hold
when using the other measure, Trade credit financing/Total assets.
We next explore whether greater social trust is also associated with corporations issuing
more equity and debt during banking crises. As discussed in the Introduction, several existing
4

As shown in Appendix Table A6, all of these results hold when using the two alternative metrics for differentiating
between high- and low-liquidity needs industries: Inventories/CoGS and Trade credit reliance.

22

studies suggest that social trust exerts a larger impact on informal transactions, such as the
extension of trade credit, than it does on more formal financing channels, such as equity and debt
issuance. From this perspective, trust will primarily affect corporate resilience through the trade
credit channel rather than by influencing equity and debt issuance that rely on formal legal
arrangements.
The results reported in Table 5 indicate that Trust does not affect a firm’s issuance of
equity and debt during banking crises. As shown, Trust*Crisis enters insignificantly in both the
Equity Issuance and Debt Issuance regressions, whether examining the full sample or when
splitting the sample into high and low Liquidity needs industries. The results suggest that social
trust does not affect corporate resilience by shaping a firm’s access to equity and debt.

5. Trust and Firm Profitability and Employment during Banking Crises
We now evaluate whether corporate profits and employment are more resilient to banking
crises in economies with greater social trust. To do this, we again employ equation (1), using
corporate profits and employment as dependent variables, and assess whether Trust*Crisis enters
positively when examining firms with high Liquidity needs.
As shown in Table 6, firms in high Liquidity needs industries in high-trust economies
enjoy a smaller drop in profits (EBIT) than similar firms in low-trust countries. For example,
consider column (2) for high Liquidity needs firms. The crisis dummy itself enters the regression
negatively and significantly, meaning that banking crises on average lead to a reduction in firm
profitability. However, the adverse effects of banking crises on profitability are less pronounced
in high-trust economies, and especially among firms with high liquidity needs, as shown by the
positive and significant coefficient on Trust*Crisis. In conjunction with the findings on social
trust and trade credit, these results are consistent with the view that social trust makes firms more
resilient to the drying up of bank credit during crises by facilitating corporate access to trade
credit.

23

The economic magnitude of the estimated impact of trust on firm profitability is
substantial. Consider the coefficient estimates on the sample of firms in high Liquidity needs
industries (column (2) of Table 6). The estimates suggest that a one standard deviation increase
in the measure of trust (0.168) leads to a two-percentage-point (=0.168*0.126) increase in EBIT.
This amount is equivalent to 37% of the sample mean of EBIT (0.057), as shown in Table 1), and
18% of the standard deviation of EBIT (0.12). To further illustrate the economic size, consider (1)
an “average” country that has average values of Trust, GDP per capita, Financial institutions
development, Stock market development, Private credit contraction, Anti-self-dealing, and
Creditor rights, and (2) a “high-trust” country with the same levels of all country characteristics
except that Trust is one-standard deviation higher than the sample average, 0.496
(=0.328+0.168). According to the coefficient estimates in column (2), a banking crisis reduces
EBIT on average by about 4% for the average country, and by 2% for the high-trust country. 5
Thus, EBIT among firms in high Liquidity needs industries in the high-trust country falls by
about 50% less during banking crises than similar firms in countries with average levels of social
trust.
Besides profits, social trust could also affect employment. If social trust eases a firm’s
access to trade credit when bank credit contracts during a crisis, then this could reduce the
adverse effects of banking crises on firm employment. Thus, we test whether firms in high
Liquidity needs industries in higher social trust economies have a smaller drop in employment
during a banking crisis than similar firms in countries with lower social trust.
We find that high Liquidity needs firms in high-trust countries experience a smaller drop
in Firm employment during banking crises than similar firms in low-trust countries. As shown in
column (5) of Table 6, the interaction term, Trust*Crisis, enters positively and significantly at
5

We calculate the average effect of a banking crisis on EBIT by plugging the sample means of the macro variables
and the corresponding coefficient estimates from column (2) of Table 6: -4.09% (= 0.126*0.328 - 0.28 +
0.0208*9.211 - 0.03*0.807 + 0.00000148*0.579 - 0.0275*0.287 + 0.0894*0.44 - 0.000518*2.059). In similar
fashion, we calculate the effect of a banking crisis for the high-trust country using the corresponding coefficients in
column (2): -1.97% (= 0.126*0.496 - 0.28 + 0.0208*9.211 - 0.03*0.807 + 0.00000148*0.579 - 0.0275*0.287 +
0.0894*0.44 - 0.000518*2.059).

24

the 5% level in the high Liquidity-needs industries, indicating that trust helps mitigate the
adverse shock of a crisis on Firm employment among industries that rely heavily on liquidity
provisions. In contrast—and consistent with the theory of how social trust influences corporate
resilience by facilitating access to trade credit, column (6) shows that the coefficient estimate on
Trust*Crisis is insignificant in the low Liquidity-needs industries.
The estimated magnitudes are large. 6 Again, consider an “average” country and a “hightrust” country with Trust, which is the same as the average country except that it has onestandard deviation higher Trust. According to the OLS estimates in column (5) of Table 6, a
banking crisis reduces corporate employment among high Liquidity needs firms by 25% in the
average country, but by 20% in the high-trust country. 7 Thus, among high Liquidity needs firms,
employment falls by almost 20% less during a systemic banking crisis in the high-trust country.
These results on corporate profits and employment are robust to many factors. First, the
Table 6 regressions condition on the Macro interaction controls, i.e., the regressions include the
interactions between Crisis and (a) GDP per capita, (b) Financial institutions development, (c)
Stock market development, (d) Private credit contraction, (e) Anti-self-dealing, and (f) Creditor
rights. Furthermore, the regressions include firm and year fixed effects, as well as time-varying
Firm controls (Firm size, Long-term debt, and Tobin’s Q). Second, Table 7 shows that the results
are robust to controlling for the level of development of formal institutions. As in Table 3, Table
7 controls for the interaction between Crisis and Rule of law and Institutional quality and
demonstrates that all of the results hold. 8 Third, the results are robust to examining alternative
measures of firm performance, such as Net income and corporate Cash flow (Appendix Table
6

Note that we can interpret the coefficients in percentage changes because Firm employment is defined as the
natural logarithm of the total number of employees in a firm.
7
We calculate the average effect of a systemic banking crisis by plugging in the sample average values and the
corresponding coefficient estimates using column (5) of Table 6: -24.6% (=0.257*0.328 – 1.574 + 0.126*9.211 +
0.0818*0.807 – 0.0583*0.579 + 0.155*0.287 + 0.191*0.44 – 0.0377*2.059). Similarly, for the high-trust country,
We plug in Trust with a value that is one standard deviation above the sample mean while holding other country
characteristics with their mean values: -20.3% (=0.257*0.496 – 1.574 + 0.126*9.211 + 0.0818*0.807 –
0.0583*0.579 + 0.155*0.287 + 0.191*0.44 – 0.0377*2.059).

As shown in Appendix Table A9, all of these results hold when using the two alternative metrics for differentiating
between high- and low-liquidity needs industries: Inventories/CoGS and Trade credit reliance.

25

A7), or to using alternative measures of the technological level of liquidity needs, such as
Inventories/CoGS and Trade credit reliance (Appendix Table A8).
The results are also robust to controlling for differential trends, as shown in Table 8. In a
series of sensitivity analyses, we add to the regressions the interactions between time trends
(Trends) and (1) country effects, (2) country-industry effects, and (3) firm effects. Panel A
provides the results on profits, while Panel B provides the results on firm employment. All of the
results on both profits and employment from Table 6 hold when conditioning on either Country
dummy*Trends or Country-Industry dummy*Trends as shown Table 8. The results on profits also
hold when including for Firm dummy*Trends effects. When examining employment and
controlling for Firm dummy*Trends, as well as the other control variables, we continue to find
that (1) the Trust*Crisis interaction terms enter positively and significantly, inducting that
corporate employment is more resilient to systemic banking crises in high trust economies and (2)
the point estimates for the high Liquidity needs industries are greater than those in low Liquidity
needs industries, but the difference between these high and low Liquidity needs industries in
these employment regressions when controlling for individual firm trends is not statistically
significant. With this caveat, the results on the connection between social trust and corporate
resilience to systemic banking crises are quite robust to controlling for trends.

6. Conclusion
In this paper, we investigate whether social trust improves corporate resilience to
systemic banking crises. Although there are enormous bodies of research on both financial crises
and social trust, we are unaware of any previous research on the role of social trust in affecting
the response of firms and economies to systemic banking crises.
The results suggest that (1) social trust facilitates access to trade credit during systemic
banking crises that impede the normal bank-lending channel, (2) social trust makes corporate
profits and employment more resilient to banking crises, and (3) the impact of social trust on
trade credit financing and corporate performance is more pronounced among firms that for
26

technological reasons rely heavily on short-term liquidity. The findings are not explained by
other country characteristics including (a) the severity of a banking crisis, (b) the development of
financial institutions and stock markets, (c) the legal protections pertaining to creditors and
shareholders, (d) the overall economic conditions, (e) the general legal rules and institutional
quality. The results emphasize the heterogeneous response of firms and economies to systemic
banking crises. Along with Levine, Lin, and Xie (2016), this paper shows that economies and
firms that facilitate nonbank forms of finance increase resiliency to failures in the banking
system.

Each dot in the figure represents the average change in the ratio of Trade credit financing/CoGS
for firms in a country, against the level of social trust in the country. Specifically, we first
calculate for each firm the difference between Trade credit financing/CoGS during a crisis, [t,
t+3], and before the crisis, [t-3, t-1]. We then average this difference across all of the firms
within each individual country, and plot the averaged difference in a country against its level of
social trust.

Each dot in the figure represents the average change in the ratio of earnings before interest and
taxes (EBIT) to total assets (EBIT/Total assets) in the left panel, and the average change in the
number of employees (Ln(Employees)) in the right panel, for firms in a country, against the level
of social trust in the country. Specifically, we first calculate for each firm the difference between
EBIT/Total assets (Ln(Employees)) during a crisis, [t, t+3], and before the crisis, [t-3, t-1]. We
then average this difference across all of the firms within each individual country, and plot the

Table 2 Social trust and trade credit over banking crises, [t-3, t+3]
This table reports regression results of the relation between social trust and firms’ trade credit received during
banking crisis episodes [t-3, t+3], where t is the start-year of a systemic banking crisis defined in Laeven and
Valencia (2012). The dependent variables are the net increase in trade credit financing as a share the cost of goods
sold (Trade credit financing/CoGS) in columns (1)-(3) and the net increase in trade credit financing as share of total
assets (Trade credit financing/Total assets) in columns (4)-(6). For each dependent variable, there are three columns
corresponding, in turn, to overall sample, high liquidity needs industries, and low liquidity needs industries, where
we partition industries by the median value of Liquidity needs, which is defined as the ratio of inventories to total
sales calculated at the three-digit SIC level (Raddatz, 2006). Crisis equals one in the start-year of a crisis and for the
three years afterward, [t, t+3], and zero otherwise, [t-3, t-1]. GDP per capita equals the natural logarithm of real
gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, measured three years before the start-year of the banking crisis. Financial
institutions development equals the ratio of private credit by deposit money banks and other financial institutions to
GDP, measured three years before the start-year of the banking crisis. Stock market capitalization equals the ratio of
stock market capitalization to GDP, measured three years before the start-year of the banking crisis. Private credit
contraction equals the average annual growth rate in bank credit to private firms between t-3 and t-1, where t is the
start-year of the crisis, minus the minimum annual growth rate of bank credit to private firms during the period
between t and t+3. Anti-self-dealing is an index of the extent to which minority shareholders are protected by the
laws from being expropriated by the insiders through self-dealing transactions. Creditor rights is an index of the
laws provide creditors the legal ability to voice their opinions, get repaid, and affect the reorganization process. Firm
size (lag) equals the logarithm of total assets lagged one year. Long-term debt (lag) equals long-term debt divided by
total assets lagged one year. Tobin’s q (lag) equals Ln [(Market value of equity + Book value of assets - Book value
of equity) / Book value of assets] lagged one year. Regression coefficients are estimated using ordinary least squares
(OLS). T-statistics are reported in parenthesis and calculated using robust standard errors clustered at the country
level. *, **, and *** represent significant levels at 10%, 5%, and 1%, respectively.

Table 3 Horserace tests on trade credit: social trust vs. rule of law and institutional quality
This table reports regression results of the relation between social trust and firms’ trade credit received during banking crisis episodes, while controlling for
measures of legal and institutional development. The dependent variables are the net increase in trade credit financing as a share the cost of goods sold (Trade
credit financing/CoGS) in columns (1)-(4) and the net increase in trade credit financing as share of total assets (Trade credit financing/Total assets) in columns
(5)-(8). For each dependent variable, results are provided for both high and low liquidity needs industries, where we partition industries by the median value of
Liquidity needs, which equals the ratio of inventories to total sales calculated at the three-digit SIC level (Raddatz, 2006). Crisis equals one in the start-year of a
crisis and for the three years afterward, [t, t+3], and zero otherwise, [t-3, t-1]. Columns (1)-(2) and (5)-(6) control for the interaction between Crisis and the Rule
of law, which measures the quality of contract enforcement, property rights, and control over crime and violence. Columns (3)-(4) and (7)-(8) control for the
interaction between Crisis and Institutional quality, which is a broad index of institutional quality. The Macroeconomic interaction controls include Crisis
interacted with: GDP per capita, Financial institutions development, Stock market capitalization, Private credit contraction, Anti-self-dealing, and Creditor
rights. The Firm controls include: Firm size (lag), Long-term debt (lag), and Tobin’s q (lag). Table A1 provides variable definitions. Regression coefficients are
estimated using ordinary least squares (OLS). T-statistics are reported in parenthesis and calculated using robust standard errors clustered at the country level. *,
**, and *** represent significant levels at 10%, 5%, and 1%, respectively.

Table 4 Social trust and trade credit over banking crises, controlling for time trends
This table reports regression results of the relation between social trust and firms’ newly obtained trade credit during banking crisis episodes, while controlling
for different trends within country, country-industry, and individual firms. The dependent variables are the net increase in trade credit financing as a share the
cost of goods sold (Trade credit financing/CoGS) throughout the columns. For each set of time trends there are three columns corresponding to the overall
sample, high liquidity needs industries, and low liquidity needs industries, where we partition industries by the median value of Liquidity needs, which equals the
ratio of inventories to total sales calculated at the three-digit SIC level (Raddatz, 2006). Crisis equals one in the start-year of a crisis and for the three years
afterward, [t, t+3], and zero otherwise, [t-3, t-1]. Columns (1)-(3) control for the interaction between country dummy and the time trends variable, Trends,
indicating one of the years over [t-3, t+3]. In particular, Trends is set to one for t-3, two for t-2, three for t-3, four for t, five for t+1, six for t+2, and seven for t+3.
Columns (4)-(6) control for the interaction between country-industry (at the three-digit SIC level) dummy and Trends. Columns (7)-(9) control for the interaction
between individual firm dummy and Trends. The Macroeconomic interaction controls include Crisis interacted with: GDP per capita, Financial institutions
development, Stock market capitalization, Private credit contraction, Anti-self-dealing, and Creditor rights. The Firm controls include: Firm size (lag), Longterm debt (lag), and Tobin’s q (lag). Table A1 provides variable definitions. Regression coefficients are estimated using ordinary least squares (OLS). T-statistics
are reported in parenthesis and calculated using robust standard errors clustered at the country level. *, **, and *** represent significant levels at 10%, 5%, and
1%, respectively.

This table reports regression results of the relation between social trust and profits and employment during banking crises episodes, while controlling for
measures of legal and institutional development. The dependent variables are earnings before income and taxes (EBIT) in columns (1)-(4) and the natural
logarithm of the number of one thousand employees (Firm employment) in columns (5)-(8). For each dependent variable, results are provided for both high and
low liquidity needs industries, where we partition industries by the median value of Liquidity needs, which equals the ratio of inventories to total sales calculated
at the three-digit SIC level (Raddatz, 2006). Crisis equals one in the start-year of a crisis and for the three years afterward, [t, t+3], and zero otherwise, [t-3, t-1].
Columns (1)-(2) and (5)-(6) control for the interaction between Crisis and the Rule of law, which measures the quality of contract enforcement, property rights,

Table 8 Social trust and firm performance over banking crises, controlling for time trends
This table reports regression results of the relation between social trust and firms’ profits and employment during banking crisis episodes, while controlling for
differential trends within country, country-industry, and individual firms. The dependent variables are the earnings before income and taxes (EBIT) in Panel A
and the natural logarithm of the number of one thousand employees (Firm employment) in Panel B. For each set of time trends control, there are three columns
corresponding to the overall sample, high liquidity needs industries, and low liquidity needs industries, where we partition industries by the median value of
Liquidity needs, which equals the ratio of inventories to total sales calculated at the three-digit SIC level (Raddatz, 2006). Crisis equals one in the start-year of a
crisis and for the three years afterward, [t, t+3], and zero otherwise, [t-3, t-1]. For both Panels, Columns (1)-(3) control for the interaction between country
dummy and the time trends variable, Trends, indicating one of the years over [t-3, t+3]. In particular, Trends is set to one for t-3, two for t-2, three for t-3, four for
t, five for t+1, six for t+2, and seven for t+3. Columns (4)-(6) control for the interaction between country-industry (at the three-digit SIC level) dummy and
Trends. Columns (7)-(9) control for the interaction between individual firm dummy and Trends. The Macroeconomic interaction controls include Crisis
interacted with: GDP per capita, Financial institutions development, Stock market capitalization, Private credit contraction, Anti-self-dealing, and Creditor
rights. The Firm controls include: Firm size (lag), Long-term debt (lag), and Tobin’s q (lag). Table A1 provides variable definitions. Regression coefficients are
estimated using ordinary least squares (OLS). T-statistics are reported in parenthesis and calculated using robust standard errors clustered at the country level. *,

It is assessed by asking people the following question: "Generally speaking, would you say that
most people can be trusted, or that you can’t be too careful in dealing with people?" We
calculate as the level of trust the percentage of respondents in each nation choosing the option of
“most people can be trusted”. We use the trust level at t-3, where t is the start year of a banking

creditor approval is required before a debtor files for reorganization (reorganization
restrictions), (2) creditors are guaranteed to take possession of their collateral if the
reorganization is approved (no automatic stay), (3) secured creditors are the first to get
compensated from the liquidation proceeds (secured creditors first), and (4) an administrator
assigned by either the creditors or the court, rather than the incumbent manager, is operating the
firm in the process of reorganization (Management does not stay). Each item takes the value of
one when the answer is yes according to the bankruptcy and reorganization laws in a certain
country. The overall index ranges from zero to four, with higher value indicating more powerful
creditor rights in the case of bankruptcy.

ex-ante disclosure requirements for the transaction purchasing company, the main owner of the
selling company, and the independent review by a professional third party, while the ex-post
component is the average of requirements for periodic detailed disclosure on the transaction and
the ease of proving wrongdoing. It ranges from zero to one, with higher value indicating
stronger minority shareholder protection against self-dealing transactions.

rights are defined as a score that measures the legal protection of people’s privately-owned
property. The score ranges from 1 to 10, with higher value representing stronger property rights.

Table A3 Social trust and the size of banking crises
This table shows the association between trust and the size of banking crises. In particular, we regress Private credit
contraction against Trust and other country traits. Private credit contraction equals the average annual growth rate
of bank credit over the pre-crisis period, [t-3, t-1], minus the minimum annual growth rate of bank credit over the
crisis period, [t, t+3], where t is the start year of a banking crisis. Trust equals the fraction of people who believe that
most people can be trusted. GDP per capita equals the natural logarithm of real GDP per capita. Financial
institutions development is the ratio of private credit by deposit money banks and other financial institutions to GDP,
Stock market development is the ratio of stock market capitalization to GDP, Creditor rights measures the power of
creditors in the events of bankruptcy, and Anti-self-dealing measures the extent to which the law protects minority
shareholders from being expropriated by the insiders through self-dealing transactions. All these country variables
are measured three years before the start of a banking crisis. Rule of law measures the quality of contract
enforcement, property rights, and control over crime and violence. Institutional quality is a comprehensive index of
institutional quality. Regression coefficients are estimated using ordinary least squares (OLS). T-statistics are
reported in parenthesis and calculated using heteroscedasticity robust standard errors. *, **, and *** represent
significant level at 10%, 5%, and 1%, respectively.

This table reports robustness tests on the relation between social trust and firms’ newly obtained trade credit during
banking crisis episodes in columns (1) – (2), firm profitability in columns (3) – (4), and firm employment in
columns (5) – (6) using two-way cluster at the country and year levels. Similar to Table 2 in the main text, we split
the sample by the median value of industry liquidity needs, defined as the ratio of inventories to total sales
calculated at the three-digit SIC level (Raddatz, 2006). The Macroeconomic interaction controls include Crisis
interacted with: GDP per capita, Financial institutions development, Stock market capitalization, Private credit
contraction, Anti-self-dealing, and Creditor rights. The Firm controls include: Firm size (lag), Long-term debt (lag),
and Tobin’s q (lag). Table A1 provides variable definitions. Regression coefficients are estimated using ordinary

Table A7 Social trust and firm performance over banking crises: Alternative performance
measures
This table reports the relation between social trust and firm profits during banking crises using alternative measures
of profitability. The dependent variables are Net income across all the columns in Panel A, and Cash flow across all
the columns in Panel B. Column (1) shows the results using all firms in the sample, while columns (2) – (7) are the
split-sample results. Specifically, we partition the overall sample based on the median values of Liquidity needs in
columns (2) and (3), Inventories/CoGS in columns (4) and (5), and Trade credit reliance in columns (6) and (7),
respectively. The Macroeconomic interaction controls include Crisis interacted with: GDP per capita, Financial
institutions development, Stock market capitalization, Private credit contraction, Anti-self-dealing, and Creditor
rights. The Firm controls include: Firm size (lag), Long-term debt (lag), and Tobin’s q (lag). Table A1 provides

Table A8 Trust and firm performance over banking crises: Alternative measures of liquidity needs
This table reports the similar analyses results to Table 6 using alternative liquidity measures. Specifically, Columns (1) – (4) split the sample by the ratio of
inventories to the cost of goods sold calculated at the industry (three-digit SIC) level, while columns (5) – (8) split the sample by the median value of Trade
credit reliance, defined as the ratio of trade payable to total debt calculated at the industry (three-digit SIC) level. The dependent variables are EBIT, and Firm
employment in columns (1) – (2), (5) – (6), and (3) – (4), (7) – (8), respectively. The Macroeconomic interaction controls include Crisis interacted with: GDP per
capita, Financial institutions development, Stock market capitalization, Private credit contraction, Anti-self-dealing, and Creditor rights. The Firm controls
include: Firm size (lag), Long-term debt (lag), and Tobin’s q (lag). Table A1 provides variable definitions. Regression coefficients are estimated using ordinary
least squares (OLS). T-statistics are reported in parenthesis and calculated using robust standard errors clustered at country level. *, **, and *** represent
significant level at 10%, 5%, and 1%, respectively.
