The Evolution of Longevity: Evidence from Canada
Kevin Milligan and Tammy Schirle
NBER Working Paper No. 24929
August 2018
JEL No. I14,J11,J14
ABSTRACT
We find a steep earnings-longevity gradient using fifty years of administrative data from Canada,
with men in the top ventile of earnings living eight years (11 percent) longer than those in the
bottom ventile. For women, the difference is 3.6 years. Unlike the United States, this longevity
gradient in Canada has shifted uniformly through time, with approximately equal gains across the
earnings distribution. We compare our results using cross-sectional and cohort-based methods,
finding similar trends but a steeper gradient when using cohorts. For middle-aged men, we find a
cessation of mortality improvements in recent years, comparable to changes observed in the
United States. Changes in income do not explain cross-time or cross-country differences.

Introduction

Concerns about inequality of economic outcomes have dominated the economic and political debates of the 21st century. A fundamental dimension of inequality is longevity, which has come more
sharply into focus with the findings of Case and Deaton (2015, 2017) showing increases in mortality among white non-Hispanic middle-age males. The causal nature of the relationship between
socio-economic status and longevity is a matter of ongoing debate.1 However, the distribution
of longevity—whatever the cause—constitutes a central facet of the distribution of wellbeing in a
society. Moreover, changes in the distribution of longevity have far-reaching policy implications for
Social Security and other public programs, as explored recently by National Academies of Sciences,
Engineering, and Medicine (2015).
The urgency of the debate in the U.S. arises from the increase in the longevity gap between higher
and lower earners.2 There are a number of potential sources for the increasing longevity gap,
ranging from direct effects of income to indirect effects of income inequality through education,
health behaviors, health insurance, or health care. Some of these factors manifest particularly in
the United States among high-income countries (such as health insurance coverage or more extreme
income inequality), while others (such as education) are fairly comparable to other high-income
countries. This suggests that examining the evolution of the longevity gradient in other countries
can inform discussion of the sources of the increasing longevity gradient in the United States.
In this paper, we address the evolution of longevity gradients by studying the long-run relationship
between earnings and longevity in Canadian administrative public pension data. We examine
survival to older ages across quantiles defined by a measure of individual lifetime earnings, looking
at changes across thirty years of birth cohorts and fifty years of observed mortality. Our work builds
on a recent contribution by Chetty et al. (2016), which examines similar questions of income and
longevity using cross-sectional projections based on a sample of Americans between the years 2001
and 2014. We contribute through analyzing cohort rather than cross-sectional longevity, made
possible because our data spans fifty years. Using cohort data not only affords a thirty-year
horizon on changes in longevity, but also means we need not rely as heavily on projections to
form our survival rates and expected lifespans. Our research here includes a comparison of life
1 See Cutler et al. (2006) for a discussion of the causal relationship between socio-economic status and mortality
both across and within countries.

the mortality gradient over time can be found in National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (2015).

expectancies under cohort-based and cross-sectional methodologies. Moreover, we can compare the
impact of measuring average earnings over short (one year) to longer (ten year) periods to observe
the sensitivity of longevity gradients to how income is measured.
We have two major findings. First, we document substantial differences in life expectancy across
the earnings distribution in Canada. Over the time period of our sample, men in the top five
percent of the earnings distribution lived eight years longer than those in the bottom five percent
after age 50, a difference of around 11 percent of a lifespan. This contrasts to a difference of 12 years
between top and bottom ventiles found by Chetty et al. (2016) for the U.S. from age 40. Second,
longevity in Canada has shifted almost uniformly for males across the earnings distribution, with
very similar gains at the bottom and top. This finding is in stark contrast to the United States
where longevity gains have been much larger at the top of the income distribution.
In addition, we also document that mortality improvements for 50–60 year old Canadian men
stopped for recent cohorts, but we see no reversal as uncovered for the United States for nonHispanic white males by Case and Deaton (2015). We find that the uniform shift across the
earnings distribution persists when we apply a cross-sectional methodology to our data. Finally,
we show that earnings differences across cohorts and between Canada and the U.S. do not explain
much of the observed gaps.
We begin by discussing related research to put our approach and results in context. We then
describe our dataset and empirical methods. Next is our main results, followed by extensions
that facilitate comparison to recent U.S. research. We conclude with a discussion of the possible
explanations and implications of our findings.

Related Research

The seminal empirical work of Kitagawa and Hauser (1973) studied socio-economic status and
mortality by merging death records onto the 1960 U.S. Census, finding lower socio-economic status
was correlated with higher mortality. Many subsequent researchers have used a similar strategy,
including Duleep (1989) and Pappas et al. (1993), among others. Recent work matching survey
data with Social Security records has updated these findings and provided longer-run perspectives.
National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (2015) and Auerbach et al. (2017) use
the Health and Retirement Study, Meara et al. (2008) uses the Current Population Survey, while

2

Cristia (2007), Attanasio and Hoynes (2000), and Bosworth et al. (2016) use the Survey of Income
Program and Participation. Currie and Schwandt (2016) compares mortality inequality by ranking
counties by various measures of socio-economic status and comparing mortality rates. They find
substantial improvements through time in the U.S. at younger ages driven by diminishing gaps
with more disadvantaged children.
In Canada, Mustard et al. (2013) look at mortality after unemployment in Canada, using a match
of 1991 census records with mortality files. Similarly, Mustard et al. (1997) merge 1986 census
records with mortality data from the province of Manitoba. Boisclair et al. (2015) perform longevity
simulations based on data from the National Population Health Survey, exploring the implications
of longevity changes for public pension plans. Finally, Baker et al. (2017) applies the Currie and
Schwandt (2016) ranking methodology to Canada, finding decreases in socio-economic gradients
at younger ages.
All of this research using surveys carries an advantage: one can look at varied dimensions of socioeconomic status; including income, race, marital status, and education. However, the smaller
sample sizes and compressed time coverage of surveys limits the ability of researchers to address
fundamental longer-run questions.
Administrative data, while lacking in covariates, often affords larger sample sizes and may permit
longer-run analysis. In Canada, Wolfson et al. (1993) used Canada Pension Plan administrative
data, studying earnings gradients of mortality for early cohorts of Canada Pension Plan contributors. They find lower mortality rates between ages 65 to 74 for those in the highest earnings
quintile. While informative, the analysis was necessarily restricted to just 24 years because the
Canada Pension Plan only started covering earnings in 1966. This limited both the cross-cohort
comparisons and the analysis of older-age mortality. Office of the Chief Actuary (2015) also use
CPP administrative data, looking at mortality patterns of those over age 65 by CPP benefit levels.
Since Canada Pension Plan benefits don’t cover earnings in the top half of the earnings distribution, this study is limited in its scope to study differences across the whole earnings distribution.
Recent work by Ahmadi and Brown (2018) uses a large cross-section of administrative records
from firm-sponsored pension plans to characterize the relationship between mortality and observable characteristics, including disability, occupation, and pre-retirement earnings. Using a limited
time period (2012-2014) and such a selective sample of firms and plan participants, limits their
ability to inform broader public policies.

3

In the United States, Waldron (2007) uses Social Security records spanning 1912 to 1941, finding
improvements in mortality were concentrated in the top half of the lifetime earnings distribution.
Duggan et al. (2008) also uses Social Security administrative records covering the 1900 to 1942
birth cohorts, finding only a small 2-3 year difference in the age of death between the 10th and
90th percentile of lifetime earnings. Most recently, Chetty et al. (2016) merge income tax data
to Social Security Administration death records, using the universe of individuals with a Social
Security Number between the years 1999 and 2014. Family income two years prior is used to sort
individuals into quantile bins and observed cross-sectional mortality rates are projected to fill in
older ages, allowing the computation of expected lifespans conditional on attaining age 40. They
find a strong gradient of life expectancy with income percentile, and increases in life expectancy
through the 2001–2014 period of observation that strongly favor higher earners.
Our paper contributes to this literature in several ways. First, our administrative data source
affords an extraordinary time-span of data and sample sizes, and also permits the use of cohort
rather than cross-sectional analysis. We are able to use our data to check on the assumptions
used by other recent papers in this literature such as the averaging period used to gauge lifetime
earnings and also compare cohort to cross-sectional methods. In addition, by comparing the results
on the evolution of longevity in Canada to those in the United States, we can gain insight into
what may be driving the steepening mortality gradients in the U.S.

Data

We employ administrative records from the Canada Pension Plan (CPP), Canada’s earnings-related
public pension plan covering Canadians outside Quebec.3 The data provide precise and detailed
administrative information such as birth date, death date, benefit-claiming date, and annual earnings. We do not observe personal characteristics such as education, race, place of residence, or
immigrant status; and we cannot link across spouses. We draw a sample of over 11 million individuals born between 1916 and 1955, representing the records of all CPP contributors born in this
period. We observe these individuals between the years 1966 (the inaugural year of the CPP) and
2015.4 There are different databases for earnings and for benefits. When one applies to take up a
Canada Pension Plan benefit a record in the benefits file is originated based on the information in
3 We make use of an existing administrative file known as the “OCA” file, which is prepared for the periodic
statutory review of the Canada Pension Plan by the Office of the Chief Actuary of Canada.
4 The initial sample and sample selection discussed in this section is summarized in Appendix A.1.

4

the earnings file.5 We describe each of these databases in turn.
The CPP collects earnings information for everyone who has worked in Canada (outside the
province of Quebec) starting at age 18. CPP contributions on earnings must be made until age 65.6
These earnings are reported by employers to the tax authority on behalf of the employees. For the
self-employed, earnings must be reported on the annual income tax filing. The earnings database
includes lifetime earnings (starting in 1966 or age 18) for anyone who earned in Canada (outside
Quebec) at least once. If someone subsequently moved to Quebec or out of Canada entirely, he or
she would still appear in our earnings database. Until 1971, earnings were topcoded to four digits
for each employer; and from 1972 onward only five digits of annual earnings are available for each
employer. Moreover, for some years reported earnings appear to be top-coded at the pensionable
earnings cap for a subset of the sample. For those who are topcoded, we impute earnings above
the cap using individual information on earnings growth rates in neighboring uncapped years. We
tested the impact of the imputations on our mortality gradient measures, but found our results insensitive to the imputations.7 Further details and assessment of these imputations are in Appendix
B.1. The earnings database also includes date of death, including from those who died before (or
without ever) claiming benefits. We address the issue of missing data for this death information
below.
The CPP benefits database includes information on CPP benefits, including benefit type, the
effective date the benefit began, date of birth, and any reported date of death. Those who claimed
benefits under Quebec’s parallel plan are not included in this benefits database; nor are those who
never file a claim for benefits. Non-claiming could arise from not being aware of an entitlement, a
decision that a small entitlement is not worth the application effort, or because the person has left
Canada. We explore the implications of never claiming in Appendix B.2.
Our main focus is the relationship between a measure of lifetime earnings and survival. To measure
lifetime earnings, we took the sum of reported employment and self-employment earnings and
construct an inflation-adjusted average of earnings between the ages 45 to 49 (discussed more
below). We then condition our sample on survival to age 50 by including only those surviving to
5 There is also a separate database for disability benefits. We only use the disability database here to collect
death records in case the death was missed in the other databases.
6 Since 2012, CPP recipients who keep working and make contributions after age 65 receive a special postretirement benefit.
7 This insensitivity may result from the limited degree of earnings mobility among those in the upper end of the
earnings distribution at ages 45 to 49. Being a high earner is fairly persistent by that point in one’s career, so the
top coding doesn’t strongly reshuffle an individual’s quantile ranking.

at least December 31st of the year they turn 50. For survival, we code a binary variable indicating
survival to a given age. In all cases, we use age on December 31st to measure age. Because we
need to observe five years of earnings, our earliest potential year of birth cohort is 1921, but for
reasons described below we make use of only those in the 1923 and onward birth cohorts.
We imposed several additional sample conditions which are described briefly here but documented
in Appendix A. We remove a small number of individuals with inconsistency in birth dates and
sex across the two databases. To ensure consistency of the sample across our earnings and benefits
databases, we remove from the earnings database those who are earning in Quebec in their final
observed year, since they are likely to claim Quebec Pension Plan benefits instead of CPP benefits,
and therefore not be seen by us in the benefits database in later years. In addition, some of those
in the earnings database never appear in the benefits database and are never coded as dead in the
earnings database, which creates the appearance of excess survivorship affecting some particular
areas of our sample. The analysis in Appendix B.2 demonstrates that this manifests most strongly
for those that appear to be the lowest earners in the earliest cohorts. To help us overcome this
challenge, we impose the condition that at least four of the five years between age 45-49 have
non-zero earnings. This condition removes more women then men, especially among our oldest
cohorts. Appendix A.4 provides sensitivity analyses for these decisions. We also discard for our
analysis the cohorts born before 1923 where the excess survivorship problem was most acute.

at age 50, and the percentage of the total population appearing in our sample. The difference
between our sample and the population is primarily accounted for by those who did not ever earn
(and therefore were not in our sample at all) and those who earned but did not attain the four
years of earnings required by our sample selection criteria. As reported in Appendix A.1, about
26 percent of our males did not satisfy the required earnings criteria, and 38 percent of females.
Our sample, however, is still highly representative of the population. As a check on this, we
constructed age-specific annual mortality rates to compare to national aggregate mortality rates.
The correlation for males is 0.999 and for females is 0.996.8 More details can be found in Appendix
A.2.

Empirical Approach

Our data span 50 years, allowing us to construct cohort-based measures of longevity. In contrast,
standard longevity measures use observed cross-sectional data to make longevity calculations by
imposing the strong assumption of stable mortality rates across ages observed in any given year. For
much of our data, we can simply calculate actual cohort longevity measures without assumption.
To fill in the gaps at older ages we do not observe, we use standard projection methods based on
Gompertz Law; but even there we do not need to make cross-cohort assumptions.
To begin this section, we describe our approach to forming a measure of lifetime earnings. Following
that, we explain our methods for measurement of survival and projections for longevity.

4.1

Earnings and Sorting

We proxy for lifetime earnings using inflation-adjusted average earnings between the ages of 45 and
49. Appendix C.1 provides sensitivity analysis on this five-year window, showing little difference
in survival probabilities when we sort our sample using a one-year, five-year, or ten-year window
for average earnings. Separately for males and females for each year of birth, we sort the sample
into quantile bins. Most of our analysis uses ventiles (20 bins; numbered from 1 at the lowest to
20 at the highest) while for other analysis we use percentiles (numbered from 1 to 100). Because
of sample size considerations, we pool together three years of birth for some of the analysis, while
at other times we group by decade.9
8

Chetty et al. (2016, p. E2) report a correlation of 0.98 for the analogous test in their data.
section 6.3 we examine how our results change when we use alternative sorts based on pooled data across
cohorts or thresholds derived from the U.S. earnings distribution.

Survival rates

We condition our sample on survival to age 50, giving us an initial population for each year of

We can use these survival rates to calculate the average length of lives; which could also be
interpreted as a cohort-specific life expectancy from the viewpoint of age 50. We do so by summing
survival rates at ages after age 50, allowing us to form a cohort-specific measure of average life
after age 50 for any age range up to a.

i=51

In our analysis we make use of expected life in intervals between ages 51 to 100. We also do these
calculations separately for each quantile for each sex and cohort.

4.3

Gompertz projections

With data from 1966 to 2015, we can observe survival from age 50 up to age 90 for the 1925 birth
cohort, but only up to age 60 for the 1955 birth cohort. We desire to project expected lifespans up
to age 100, L50,100
m,yob for each sex and cohort. To fill in missing survival rates we make projections
based on Gompertz Law (see Gompertz, 1825). Gompertz Law posits that the relationship between
age and mortality is log-linear. Recent evidence (see Gavrilov and Gavrilova, 2011; Gavrilova and
Gavrilov, 2014) shows that the relationship holds very well at ages as old as 90.10

10 In particular, with annual data the bias from uneven distribution of ages across years does not arise before age
90 (Gavrilov and Gavrilova, 2011, p. 438). After age 90 this bias grows, leading Gompertz projections with annual
data to underpredict mortality.

8

Using the available data, we run ordinary least squares regressions of log mortality on age of the
form:

a
ln Mm,yob
= β0 + β1 a + a,m,yob .

β0 +β1 ×a

m,yob = e

projected survival as:

50,a
50,a−1
a
\
S\
m,yob = Sm,yob × (1 − Mm,yob ).

(5)

Again, this is done separately for each quantile.
To form our complete block of survival rates (age 51–100 for all cohorts), we follow Chetty et al.
(2016) and splice together longevity data over three distinct age ranges. First, we use actual data
when available up to age 75 (for cohorts born 1940 and earlier) or the last age available (cohorts
born after 1940). Next, we use Gompertz projections based on data from age 50-75 to form survival
rates for ages up to 89. Third, we use population longevity data for ages 90 plus.11 We evaluate
the fit of the Gompertz projections in Appendix B.3. The population longevity data over age
90 helps to ensure sample survival approaches population survival at these oldest ages where the
Gompertz projections may hold less well.

Main Results

The presentation of results begins with basic survival rates by sex, cohort, and quantile. We then
characterize the changes in projected life expectancy across cohorts and earnings quantiles.

5.1

Survival rates by quantile

We focus first on survival rates since they constitute the most basic component of our data and
emphasize the advantages of our cohort-based approach. In the analysis that follows, these survival
rates will be aggregated and projected to form life expectancies. But here, to begin, we examine
survival rates to age 75 by percentile of age 45-49 earnings for those born in the 1930s and who
11 We use cross-sectional mortality rates for ages 90+ taken from 2010. The source is the Canadian Human
Mortality Database (2016).

were alive at age 50. For these cohorts, we can use actual survival rates observed in the data
without Gompertz projections. There are separate lines for women and for men, with a 95 percent
confidence interval indicated for each line by shading.
Figure 1: Survival to age 75 by earnings percentile

Note: Data are from the OCA administrative file of the Canada Pension Plan. Earnings percentiles are characterized
by the average earnings observed between ages 45-49. Those born in 1930s included here. Sample includes only
those who survived to age 50. The shaded areas indicate the bounds of the 95 percent confidence intervals.

Figure 1 shows three clear results.First, for men there is a strong survival gradient with earnings
with a milder gradient for women. This parallels the findings of Chetty et al. (2016), although
our analysis is based on a woman’s own earnings, while Chetty et al. (2016) used a family income
measure.12 In our sample, the milder slope for women is therefore driven not only by the higher
underlying survival rates of women generally, but also by our sample selection criteria that leads to
the inclusion of only those women with earned income. Second, as found by Waldron (2013) and
Chetty et al. (2016), survival for men at the bottom percentiles falls off sharply, with a difference
12 Appendix figure 9c in Chetty et al. (2016) shows very little sensitivity of their results to family versus individual
incomes for men or women.

10

between the 1st and 10th percentile of 11 percentage points for men. Third, the almost-linear
consistency of the gradient over much of the earnings distribution provides further evidence against
the “hardship threshold” hypothesis studied and rejected in Wolfson et al. (1993) and Waldron
(2013). There are continued gains in survivorship as earnings increases. Between the 10th and
100th percentile, the rise in age 75 survival is close to linear, going from 63 percent to 82 percent.
So, a man at the 90th percentile of lifetime earnings has about 25 percent greater chance of living
to age 75 than does a man at the 10th percentile of earnings.
We now proceed to analysis of longevity gradients over time to examine how life expectancy has
shifted across cohorts.

5.2

Life expectancies and changes in longevity

We form life expectancies for each gender, quantile, and cohort using observed and projected
survival rates. We project mortality and survival rates in the age range up to 89 using the actual
data when available and Gompertz Law projections for ages with no survival rate available. We
then add in population mortality from age 90 in order to complete an age 51–age 100 block of
survival rates for each gender, quantile, and cohort. Finally, we aggregate these survival rates into
life expectancies. We report the number of expected years of life after age 50.
The variability of our life expectancy projections changes across cohorts, driven by two factors. We
have more observations for later cohorts, which pushes the variability down. But, our Gompertz
regressions can only use data up to age 60 for a birth in 1955, so the short span of survivor data
for more recent cohorts leads to larger variability in the projections. We have the full range over
ages 51–75 for the Gompertz regressions for all cohorts from 1940 and earlier. In the discussion
of the results, we therefore make use of simulated confidence intervals for inferences about our life
expectancy projections.13
We begin with an analysis of those born in the 1940s, and then compare to those born in the
1920s.14 We extend the analysis to the 1950s in a separate analysis below. Figure 2 displays the
projected years of life after age 50 by ventile, separately for women and for men. Each point has
a simulated 95 percent confidence interval indicated. The figure reveals important results for both
13 To

form the confidence intervals, we do 1000 simulations of our life expectancy projection. We measure the
observed sample mean and standard deviation for each sex, cohort, quantile, and age cell. We use these observed
sample moments to make draws on mortality rates based on a normal distribution and form our confidence intervals
using the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the resulting distribution.
14 Our 1920s data incorporates births between 1923 and 1929 while for the 1940s we have 1940–1949.

men it is 8.9 years. Both of these gradients are statistically significant at the 95 percent confidence
level. Living 8.9 years longer is an increase of one third in the post-age 50 lifespan compared to
the 26.8 years of life for men in the first ventile, and an 11.6 percent increase in the overall life
expectancy compared to the base of 76.8 years for first-ventile men. For women, 4.3 years is a 13
percent increase in life after age 50, and a 5 percent overall increase in lifespan.
We now turn to the shifts in this earnings-longevity gradient through time. Comparing the 1920s
to the 1940s in Figure 2, the shift in life expectancies is mostly uniform across ventiles for women
and for men. The shift for women in the bottom five ventiles (and the 11th) is not statistically
12

significant, but attains significance at the 95 percent level at other ventiles. For men, the shift
between the 1920s and 1940s in Figure 2 is significant for all ventiles, and with an average increase
of 4.4 years.15
We can extend the analysis to the 1950s, although the more limited window of observable survival
rates means that our life expectancy projections become more variable. For this reason, we aggregate to quintiles to make the comparisons of the 1920s to the 1950s. Using quintiles also facilitates
comparisons with the key findings of National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine
(2015). We present the analysis across all decades and quintiles in Table 2.
Looking across the top panels of Table 2 horizontally, the top-to-bottom quintile gradient for
Canadian women grows through time, from 1.3 years in the 1920s to 3.2 years in the 1950s–
although it is not clear how much of this change is driven by different selection into the workforce
by women across cohorts. Canadian men, on the other hand, exhibit a fairly stable gradient
between 4.9 years and 5.8 years across the four decades.
Comparing the 1950s to the 1920s vertically in Table 2 reveals the growth in longevity across
cohorts. For women, there is no clear pattern across quintiles, with the largest gain in the 3rd
quintile at 4.9 years and the other quintiles showing smaller gains. Again, differential selection
across cohorts makes these comparisons less easy to interpret for women. For men, there are very
stable gains across the quintiles, ranging from 4.3 years of projected extra life in the first quintile
to 5.1 years in the fifth quintile.

15 The shift is 2.3 years for the first ventile, much lower than the other ventiles. In part this reflects the permanent
survivor phenomenon we explore in Appendix B.2 that affects particularly 1920s cohorts in the lowest earnings
ventiles.

Note: Canadian data are from the OCA administrative file of the Canada Pension Plan. We report the projected
life expectancy by decade of birth, with simulated 95 per cent confidence interval in parentheses reported below.
We have all birth years in the 1930s and 1940s. We include 1923–1929 for the 1920s and 1950-1955 for the 1950s.
American projections are from National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (2015), based on data
from the Health and Retirement Study.

We compare our results to the United States for men in the bottom two panels of Table 2 and in
Figure 3, where we reproduce the headline results from National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (2015, p. 3) which compares projected life expectancies conditional on age 50
for Americans born in 1930 with those born in 1960. There was no growth in American longevity
in the bottom two quintiles. In contrast, gains in the fifth quintile were projected at 7.1 years.
For a comparable 30-year time span, we present on the right-hand side of the figure the results
from Canada for the first and fifth quintiles between the 1920s and 1950s for men, along with
bars indicating the 95 percent confidence interval. Unlike the United States, there is a statistically
significant gain in longevity in the bottom quintile. The 5.1 year gain in the top Canadian quintile
is of comparable magnitude to the first Canadian quintile, but less than the analogous American
top quintile gain of 7.1 years.

Note: Data for Canada are from the OCA administrative file of the Canada Pension Plan, and from Figure S1 from
National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (2015, p. 3) for the United States. Samples includes
only those who survived to age 50. The first and fifth quintiles are shown for each country.

15

To summarize our results, in Tables 3 and 4 we present regression estimates to characterize the
general relationship of life expectancy across birth cohorts and earnings ventiles. In the first column
of Tables 3 and 4, we only use those cohorts for which survival is observable up to age 75. Here,
we see the top-to-bottom ventile gradient of life expectancy is 3.4 years, and 7.8 years for men.
The estimates for the top-to-bottom ventile gradients are slightly higher when the estimates of
all cohorts’ life expectancy are included (as in column 2). The third and fourth columns present
results for survival to age 75, with similar top-to-bottom ventile gradients as estimated for life
expectancy. Overall, these results demonstrate there are large and substantial differences in life
expectancies across earnings groups.
For context, we compare our results to the life expectancy gradients appearing in Chetty et al.
(2016), although there are important differences in the methodology (which we explore later in
the paper). For the period 2001–2014 between the top and bottom ventiles Chetty et al. (2016)
find gradients of 7.9 years for women and 11.9 years for men.16 So, if we take our cohort-based
measure and the Chetty et al. (2016) cross-section measure as comparable, the magnitude of the
life expectancy gradient in Canada is about 75 percent of the value in the United States for men,
and 54 percent for women. Below in Section 6.2 we assess the comparability of the cohort-based
and cross-sectional methodologies.

16 We calculate the Chetty et al. (2016) ventiles by averaging the projected life expectancies across the five
percentiles in each ventile reported in the data in their online data appendix for Table 2.

Summary of main results

In this section, we have presented two main significant results. First, we have documented the
existence and magnitude of survival and life expectancy gradients across the earnings distribution
for Canada. Our regression findings of an 8.1 year difference between high and low earning men
and 3.6 years for women are large and economically significant. Our findings provide context for
the recent results for the United States in Chetty et al. (2016), and extend significantly the early
work of Wolfson et al. (1993) using similar Canadian administrative data. Second, we have shown
that longevity has evolved very differently in Canada compared to the United States. Our finding
of a uniform shift in Canadian longevity across the earnings distribution is in sharp contrast to the
experience of the United States where several researchers have found sharply steepening longevity
gradients (Auerbach et al. 2017, Bosworth et al. 2016, Chetty et al. 2016, Cristia 2007, National
Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine 2015, Olshansky et al. 2012, Waldron 2007,
Waldron 2013).

Extended results

We extend our results to examine the special case of middle-age males, compare results using
cohort-based and cross-sectional methodologies, and explore the impact of earnings growth on our
longevity findings. This extended analysis offers additional depth and context to our results and
facilitate comparisons with recent findings in the United States.

6.1

Survival rates of middle-aged males

We draw a subset of our data to make explicit comparisons to the work of Case and Deaton (2015,
2017) for the United States, which uncovered a rise in mortality rates for non-Hispanic white
middle-aged males between the years 2000 and 2015. The heightened “deaths of despair” from
drugs, alcohol, and suicide may reflect economic or social factors that also manifest in Canada.
The Canadian economy since 2000 overall has followed a different path than the United States,
with a natural resources boom that boosted the labor market in some regions.17 On the other
hand, regions with a traditional manufacturing base have been affected similar to manufacturing
17 Milligan and Schirle (2017) provides a comparison of the Canadian and American labour market outcomes in
the 1990s and 2000s.

19

regions in the United States. In addition, the rise of opioids in Canada has mirrored trends in the
United States (Fischer et al. 2016).
To attempt a comparison to the findings from the United States, we select data on survival rates
between the ages of 50 and 60 for males. Our data do not allow us to make similar ethnic or racial
selections, nor to pull out different geographies. So, the comparison of our sample to Case and
Deaton (2015, 2017) is therefore imperfect.
Figure 4: Age 60 survival for males by 3-year cohort

Note: Data are from the OCA administrative file of the Canada Pension Plan. We show the survival at age 60
conditional on survival to age 50, with calculated 95 percent confidence intervals shaded.

We graph survival rates in Figure 4 using birth cohorts of males in three year groupings from 1923–
1925 to 1953–1955. We show only every 2nd group of three years in order to keep the presentation
of results clear. The calculated 95 percent confidence interval is indicated with shading, becoming
smaller across cohorts because of increased cohort size. We focus on survival rates rather than life
expectancies to keep the comparison with Case and Deaton (2015, 2017) tight and also because

20

we are able to use observed data without reliance on more-variable projections of life expectancy.
The survival rates until the 1950s reveal a pattern similar to the main results presented earlier—
a clear upward gradient in survival with earnings, and a clear upward progression across birth
cohorts. However, the results for the 1952-1955 cohort are remarkably different. The survival rates
are right on top of the 1947–1949 birth cohorts at lower earning ventiles, only rising significantly
above the previous cohort group in the 19th and 20th ventile. We do not observe any reversal in
mid-age male survival, but we do observe a sudden cessation of survival improvements. As these
cohorts age and younger cohorts enter the middle-age range, it will be interesting to see if this
emerging change in survival rates persists as further data on these cohorts become available.

6.2

Cohort and cross-section life expectancy

Standard measures of mortality, survival, and life expectancy are based on cross-sectional methods.
In any given year, deaths are compared to population at risk and then aggregated across ages to
form survival rates. Often, though, measures based on the actual lifetime experience of cohorts
would be superior if available, since we often want to know how social or economic forces have
changed the life trajectories of those affected by shocks. Cohort-based measures require both
longitudinal capturing of data and very long time periods, both of which present often-insuperable
challenges. So, a better understanding of the efficacy of cross-sectional methods as an easier-tocalculate proxy for cohort survivor rates would provide stronger support for their use.
The recent paper by Chetty et al. (2016) makes use of cross-sectional methods to generate life
expectancies. Using income lagged two years to assign income quantiles, each year’s observations
for each sex and quantile are used to form age-specific survival rates. These survival rates are
then projected to older ages using a similar Gompertz approach to what we used in this paper. In
comparing our results to Chetty et al. (2016), a natural question arising is whether the difference
between cohort-based and cross-sectional methodologies underlies any differences in our findings.
We pursue this question in this subsection.
We form blocks of survival rates using the Chetty et al. (2016) methodology for each year, sex,
and quantile of earnings.18 Because we have data stretching back to 1966, we can implement the
methodology over almost the entire 50 years of our data. To make the comparison to Chetty et al.
18 We continue to use earnings rather than family income to characterize the income distribution because our
data does not include other non-earning sources of income. So, our implementation of the Chetty et al. (2016)
methodology is imperfect.

21

(2016) tight, we draw a sample covering the same years: 2001 to 2014. We supplement this time
range with an additional sample from the 1970s (1970–1979) in order to see whether our “uniform
shift” finding can be replicated using the cross-sectional methodology.
Figure 5: Life expectancy using different methodologies

Note: Data for Canada are from the OCA administrative file of the Canada Pension Plan. Data for the United
States are from Figure 2 in Chetty et al. (2016). The lines here show life expectancy conditional on survival to age
50—except for the U.S. 2001–14 line which is conditional on survival to age 40. Shaded areas show simulated 95
percent confidence intervals.

The results are shown in Figure 5. We focus here exclusively on men since differential selection
of women in the Canadian data would complicate the comparison. We graph the life expectancies
from Figure 2 of Chetty et al. (2016) for the U.S. for 2001–2014 alongside our Canadian data for
2001–2014. To note, the U.S. data is conditional on survival to age 40 while the Canadian data
is conditional on survival to age 50. The figure also shows the Canadian cross-sectional results for
the 1970s and the cohort-based results for those born in the 1930s.
There are three relevant and revealing comparisons in Figure 5. Using a similar methodology

22

and 2001–2014 time frame, the gradient in the United States remains steeper than Canada, with
lower survival at lower income levels in the United States but higher survival at high income levels.
Second, comparing the two Canadian cross-sectional lines, it is clear that the “uniform shift” result
in our cohort-based methodology also manifests in the cross-sectional approach. So, the different
evolution of longevity in Canada and the United States cannot be attributed to differences in
methodology. Finally, there is a strong indication that the gradient for Canada using the cohortbased approach is steeper than with the cross-sectional approach. The difference in slope is 0.08
years per ventile, which adds to 1.6 years over the 20 ventiles.19 So, the cohort-based slope is
28 percent steeper than the cross-sectional slope. This may suggest that the income-longevity
gradient found in Chetty et al. (2016) understates the actual experience of cohorts across time.

6.3

Comparisons across earnings distributions

Some of the differences in earnings-longevity gradients we have documented across cohorts and
countries may be a result of differences in the shape and position of the earnings distribution. For
example, some of the observed changes in longevity over time may be driven by higher earnings of
later cohorts. Similarly, the higher longevity at high quantiles in the United States might result
from the higher levels of income necessary to attain a high quantile ranking in the United States—
if we compare similarly-high earning Canadians we can assess the importance of differences in
earnings to the observed longevity gradients. In both cases, we can assess these possibilities by
re-sorting our data using common earning thresholds across cohorts and countries. We pursue this
re-sorting analysis for men in Figure 6.
Our analysis embeds three sets of lines in Figure 6. The first set of lines is a baseline earningslongevity gradient for the 1923–25 and 1938–40 cohorts of men, matching the estimates of life
expectancy represented in Table 4. This is labeled as “Canada Baseline.” As before, we observe
a fairly uniform shift in life expectancy of about four years across earnings ventiles between those
born in 1923–25 and 1938–40.
The second comparison in Figure 6 takes the same two birth cohorts, but re-sorts them into ventiles
based on earnings thresholds that are common across all birth cohorts. To do so, we include all
men across our sample from 1923–1955 and find the earnings ventile cutoffs based on this common
sample. So, with any earnings growth, some top-ventile men born in 1923–1925 may be re-sorted
19 We run a regression of the life expectancy on a linear ventile term and a linear ventile term interacted with a
dummy for cohort-based estimates. The resulting coefficient on the differential slope is -0.079 (0.032).

Note: Data for Canada are from the OCA administrative file of the Canada Pension Plan. Thresholds for the
20 income groups (ventiles) are based on (a) each 3-year year of birth cohort in Canada, (b) the full sample of

downward if they no longer surpass the higher earnings threshold based on the common sample.
These results are labeled “Canada Common.” For the 1923–1925 cohort at the bottom, there is a
small change when the data are re-sorted. For the later 1938–1940 cohort, the re-sorted data with
the common thresholds is very close to the baseline data. The explanation for this small change is
the lack of earnings growth in these particular cohorts. The 1925 birth cohort was age 50 in 1975
and the 1940 birth cohort was age 50 in 1990. This period was one of generally stagnating male
earnings, so the re-sorting had little effective change on quantile rankings.20
The third comparison in Figure 6 compares the baseline results to a re-sort that uses ventile
20 See Lemieux and Riddell (2016) for evidence on income growth between 1982 and 2010. While there was large
growth in the top part of the top one percent of the income distribution, growth in the bottom 90 percent was
negligible.

thresholds based on earnings in the United States.21 The distribution of earnings is clearly wider
in the U.S. than in Canada, so that as high-survival Canadian men are re-sorted into lower ventile
groups, those remaining in the higher ventiles have better longevity. Moreover, as men are resorted out of the high earnings ventile downward, they pull up the longevity compared to the
baseline sort. However, when we apply this re-sort these differences are insignificant and fairly
small compared to the differences across cohorts.
Overall, we interpret these findings as suggesting that while cross-country and through-time differences in the earnings distribution will affect our estimates of the earnings-longevity gradient,
these differences are small and factors other than earnings levels are the primary driver of longevity
differences we have documented in our baseline analysis.

Discussion

Our results reveal a sharp difference in the evolution of longevity in Canada and the United States.
While longevity gains have been concentrated in the top half of the earnings distribution in the
United States, we find fairly uniform gains across the earnings distribution for Canada. In this
section, we discuss several possible explanations for this finding. Of course, causally isolating factors
that explain this broad cross-cohort change is difficult and we don’t attempt it here. Instead, the
discussion aims to set the stage for deeper investigations of possible causal channels by interpreting
our findings in the context of existing theory and evidence.
Lleras-Muney and Moreau (2018) provides a useful theoretical framework for this discussion. In
their model, mortality at a point in time is a function of ‘frailty’. Individuals receive an initial
endowment of frailty as in Vaupel et al. (1979). However, the Lleras-Muney and Moreau (2018)
model then adds dynamics like the Grossman (1972) health capital model: investments, shocks,
and depreciation that shifts the initial endowment of frailty period by period as one ages. The
main implication of the model is that the probability of mortality at any time depends on the
history of shocks and investments over one’s lifetime.
Our discussion proceeds by considering three possible explanations for the different evolution of the
longevity gradient in Canada and the United States: health insurance, education and information
21 These earnings thresholds are calculated using average age 45–49 earnings in the Current Population Survey
for each birth cohort, using survey years 1968–2004 for cohorts ranging from 1923–1925 to 1953–1955. We adjust
these earnings by inflation and the U.S.-Canada exchange rate and find the ventile cutoffs. We then attach these
U.S. cutoffs to our Canadian data by cohort.

25

processing, and long-run stress and hardship.
The first possibility we consider is health insurance differences between Canada and the United
States. While an obvious place to start the comparison, several factors weigh against this explanation. First, the Lleras-Muney and Moreau (2018) model suggests caution in expecting health
insurance near the end of life to have much impact, since the accumulated stock of frailty is more
affected by things that occur earlier in life than the insurance available at a certain point in time.
Second, Cutler et al. (2006) argue that the empirical evidence does not support health insurance
improving mortality at older ages.22 Third, the birth cohorts we consider in Canada were born well
before the wide-spread introduction of universal public health insurance in Canada in the 1960s.23
These three arguments tend to downgrade the importance of health insurance as an explanation
for the Canada–US difference in the longevity gradient.
Another possible source of the mortality gradient in the United States is education and how
information is processed into health behaviors.24 Cutler et al. (2006, p. 115) argues that education
mediates the diffusion of health information and technological change, leading them to predict (p.
117) that the pace of technological change in health will lead to a steepening mortality gradient.
However, Cutler et al. (2011) find that changes in health behaviors alone cannot explain the growing
gap. Instead, it is growth in the consequences of negative health behaviors that underlies education
differences. Recent evidence suggests that differences in health behaviors may have substantial
long-run impact on survival after age 50 (Li et al. 2018). Beyond education, many argue that
poverty directly impairs cognitive judgement and choices that are made.25 Increased cognitive
loads could also affect the adaptation of health information in the same way as lower education.
However, for the information and health behavior explanation to hold, Canada–U.S. differences in
education and cognition across the whole bottom half of the lifetime earnings distribution would
need to be evolving in sharply different directions.
22 See,

for example, Finkelstein and McKnight (2008) for evidence from the introduction of Medicare in the United
States. There was no estimated effect on mortality, although there was a substantial impact on out-of-pocket health
expenses.
23 See Hanratty (1996) and the references cited therein for a history of the introduction of public health insurance
in Canada.
24 Elo and Preston (1996) document mortality differentials by education in the U.S. from 1979-1985. See LlerasMuney (2005) for causal evidence of the relationship between education and mortality. Meara et al. (2008) document
the central role of education in the changing mortality gap, finding that almost all gains in mortality are accruing to
higher-educated Americans. Olshansky et al. (2012) argue that race and educational differences are central to the
widening mortality differences. Bound et al. (2015) adds caution because of the changing composition of education
groups through time, but still finds that lower-educated Americans are not sharing in mortality improvements.
25 See Schilbach et al. (2016), Haushofer and Fehr (2014) and Mani et al. (2013) for theory and evidence on the
psychological link between poverty and cognition.

26

The final explanation to consider is long-run stress and hardship. Cutler et al. (2006, p. 114) discuss
evidence linking mortality and psychosocial stress from being in a low-status or subservient position
with little control over important decisions. Bio-psychological reactions to such circumstances
can build up an allostatic load through constant exposure to stress hormones like cortisol.26 In
the Lleras-Muney and Moreau (2018) model, the continuing drag of a heightened allostatic load
would speed up health depreciation and increase mortality. The social safety net in Canada is
presently more generous to those at the bottom of the distribution than in the United States.27
However, it is not clear this gap favored Canada in the middle part of the twentieth century when
several of the cohorts we study had already entered adulthood. Moreover, wages for those who
are working in Canada were lower over the lifetime of the birth cohorts we consider, so it’s not
clearly the case that lifetime economic resources were sufficiently different over the bottom half of
the earnings distribution to explain the difference in longevity trends. On the other hand, stressful
considerations such as violent crime and unavailability of health insurance experienced over decades
could in principle act through the allostatic channel to wear down health and increase mortality.

Conclusion

In this paper, we study the relationship between earnings and longevity using a comprehensive
administrative dataset of Canadian men and women spanning a half century. We find that the
gap in life expectancy between the lowest and highest earners is about eight years for men—an
11 percent difference in lifespan. This is about 75 percent of the steepness of the gradient found
recently by Chetty et al. (2016) for the United States. In sharp contrast to the United States,
however, evolution of this earnings-longevity gradient has been a mostly-uniform shift, with equal
improvements among high and low earners. Improvements in survival for middle age men in
Canada have stopped upward progress for those born in the 1950s, echoing results of Case and
Deaton (2015, 2017). We still find a similar gradient and uniform shift when applying the Chetty
et al. (2016) cross-sectional methodology to our data, although the slope of the gradient is flatter
when using the cross-sectional methodology compared to the cohort-based measure. Finally, we
consider the importance of widening earnings distributions and suggest that changes to the earnings
distribution may have only small impacts on the earnings-longevity gradient. The paper closes with

a discussion of several possible explanations for the Canada-U.S. difference, ranging from health
insurance to education and health behaviors to stress and hardship. We conclude by noting that
neither theory nor evidence provides a clear indication which of these explanations may hold. As
the relationship between longevity and earnings is fundamental to the distribution of older-life
wellbeing and the design of social programs, understanding the sources pushing the evolution of
longevity should be a priority for future research.

Comparison with population mortality

In order to assess the representativeness of our sample, we construct age-year mortality rates
separately for men and women for ages 50-100. We compare these to the population mortality rates
taken from Canadian Human Mortality Database (2016), aggregated across Canada but excluding
residents of the province of Quebec to make the aggregate data comparable to our sample which
29

excludes most Quebec residents. We form similar three-year groups for each data source. The
results are presented below in Figure A.2. The correlation for males is 0.999 and for females is
0.996.

Note: Data are from the OCA administrative file of the Canada Pension Plan and Canadian Human Mortality
Database (2016). Age-year-sex period mortality rates are formed in each dataset and plotted against each other.

A.3

Quebec

The province of Quebec operates a parallel and separate Quebec Pension Plan. We observe in
our data the lifetime earnings of anyone who has contributed at least once to the Canada Pension
Plan. We do not observe the earnings of individuals who only contributed to the Quebec Pension
Plan, or the benefit claims of those who apply to the Quebec Pension Plan for benefits. So, to
maintain consistency in our data we wish to exclude those from the earnings database who are
likely to eventually apply to the Quebec Pension Plan for benefits. The Canada Pension Plan
advises individuals who have contributed to both plans over their lifetime to apply for benefits
30

based on where they live at the time of application.28
In our data, we tag individuals as ‘potential Quebec Pension Plan applicants’ based on their last
observed year of earnings. If there are contributions to both plans in the final year, we use the
higher of the two contributions to tag the individual. We remove those tagged as potential Quebec
Pension Plan applicants from our data. As seen in Table A1, around 4.75 percent of our sample
contributed to both plans.
To assess the sensitivity of our results to this decision, in Figure A.3 we plot age 75 survival for men
and women for our baseline sample (which excludes the potential Quebec Pension Plan applicants)

you must apply for the QPP if you live in Quebec or for the CPP if you live elsewhere in Canada.”

and a sample that includes those potential Quebec Pension Plan applicants. We show the results
by lifetime earnings ventile measured as average earnings from age 45-49. The figure uses all
Canadians born in the 1930s. It is clear that the differences in mortality across these two samples
is very small, which suggests that those contributing to the Quebec plan show approximately the
same mortality patterns as those who are most likely Canada Pension Plan applicants.

Labour market attachment
Figure A3: Age 75 Survival for Samples with Different Earnings Requirements

Note: Data are from the OCA administrative file of the Canada Pension Plan. The ‘One year positive’ sample
requires only one year between ages 45-49 to show positive earnings. The baseline sample requires four out of five
years to be positive. Earnings ventiles are characterized by the average earnings observed between ages 45-49. Those
born in 1930s included here. Shaded area indicates the 95 percent confidence interval.

The goal of our analysis is to characterize survival across different levels of lifetime earnings as
measured by average earnings between ages 45 and 49. Including those with zero earnings would
produce results closer to mortality patterns of the whole population, while requiring a minimum
amount of earnings somewhat restricts the sample. In principle the broader sample may be desir32

able, but our sample includes some who earned at younger ages and then do not earn again and
do not claim benefits at older ages. This pattern would occur, for example, if someone earned
but never claimed benefits, left the country after a few years of earning, or was in Canada only
temporarily. Including such people in the sample would bias survival rates since their death would
not be observed. For this reason, we condition our baseline sample on having earnings in at least
four of the five years in the age 45-49 range. As can be seen in Table A1, this restriction removes
about one quarter of our male sample and over one third of the female sample. We tested weaker
restrictions and found that requiring four out of five years best balanced the desire for a broad
sample with the need to ensure we include only those who remained in Canada through older ages.
In Figure A3 we show our baseline results and the results for a sample where we only require one
year of earnings between ages 45 and 49. The figure displays survival rates to age 75 for men and
women born in the 1930s by earnings ventile. For men, the survival rate in the baseline sample is
slightly higher until about the 7th ventile and thereafter very close. For women there is a small
gap which persists to about the 10th ventile. In both cases the sample requiring only one year to
have positive earnings has lower survival.
Below in section B.2 we go into more detail on the problem of permanent survivors to assess
how well our labour market attachment condition removes those who may not have their deaths
observed.

Appendix: Adjustments to the data
Top Coding

The annual earnings reported in the data are censored by top-coding in two circumstances. Below
we explore the incidence of top-coding and then describe our imputation method and assess the
sensitivity of our results.
First, for some years in the 1970s and 1980s a subset of the sample appears to be top-coded at
the upper pensionable limit, called the Year’s Maximum Pensionable Earnings (YMPE). We are
unaware of any statutory reason why earnings would be reported at the YMPE. In Figure B1 we
show the proportion of men and women who had at least one year in the age range 45-49 topcoded at the YMPE by decade of birth and earnings ventile. The figure shows a positive incidence
reaching around 13 percent for women and 9 percent for men born in the 1930s and levels less

33

Note: Data are from the OCA administrative file of the Canada Pension Plan. Each line shows the proportion of
the sample censored at least once at the Year’s Maximum Pensionable Earnings. Earnings ventiles are characterized

decades as indicated. Shaded area indicates the 95 percent confidence interval.

than half that amount for those born in the 1920s. The incidence for those born in the 1940s and
1950s is negligible. For men, the impact is approximately equal across earnings ventiles, while for
women it rises until about the 15th ventile.
The second top-coding issue is a feature of the way earnings were recorded in the earnings database.
Until 1971 annual earnings were coded up to four digits, with a maximum value of $9,999. After
that year, earnings were reported only up to five digits. In Figure B2 we show the proportion of
men and women who had at least one year in the age range 45-49 censored by this digit constraint
across ventiles for each decade of birth. For women, very few are censored until the top ventile of
lifetime earnings. For men, censoring is fairly widespread at around one third of the sample for
those born in the 1920s–those most affected by the four-digit censoring–at mid-range ventiles. For

later cohorts, the five-digit censoring has impact starting around ventile 19 for the 1930s cohort,
ventile 17 for the 1940s cohort, and around ventile 15 for the 1950s cohort. By ventile 20 for men,
almost all the 1940s and 1950s cohorts had at lease one year censored by the five-digit constraint.
To address these top-coding issues we impute earnings to those who are censored. For each individual, we form a five-element vector of year-over-year real earnings growth rates. For imputing
at the four-digit constraint, we use years after the four-digit constraint was removed. For those
at the five-digit constraint and the YMPE constraint, we use earlier years to form the vector. We
then randomly draw with replacement from this vector and apply the growth rates to a ‘jump off’
year which is the uncensored year closest to the censored earnings year and calculate an imputed
earnings level.

35

Figure B3: Age 75 Survival for Samples without Earnings Imputations

Note: Data are from the OCA administrative file of the Canada Pension Plan. The ‘no top-coding adjustment’
sample does not impute earnings above the censoring point, while the baseline sample follows the imputation
procedure described in the text. Earnings ventiles are characterized by the average earnings observed between ages
45-49. Those born in 1930s included here. Shaded area indicates the 95 percent confidence interval.

In Figure B3 we test the impact of our imputation procedure by graphing the age 75 survival rate
for all cohorts by earnings quartile.29 There is almost no perceptible change. This small impact
may seem at odds with the incidence of top-coding shown in Figures B1 and B2, but the topcoding
just means we re-sort the ranking of lifetime earnings and few individuals change rankings with
and without the earnings imputations.

B.2

Permanent survivors

As discussed in Appendix section A.4, some individuals may appear for a few years in the earnings
database but are not seen again either in the earnings or the benefits database. This could occur, for
29 We use quartiles here rather than ventiles because so few observations change in the ventiles that we encounter
the minimum-disclosure rule imposed by Statistics Canada on this dataset.

36

example, if someone earned but never claimed benefits, left Canada permanently before claiming,
or lived only temporarily in Canada. In order to minimize the potential bias of including those
whose deaths may go unseen, we imposed a requirement of four earnings years between ages 45
and 49.
Figure B4: Proportion Not Appearing in Benefit Database by Age 67

Note: Data are from the OCA administrative file of the Canada Pension Plan. Each line shows the proportion of
the sample in the earnings database that survived to age 67 but did not appear in the benefits database. Earnings
ventiles are characterized by the average earnings observed between ages 45-49. Each line for men and women shows
those born in different decades as indicated. Shaded area indicates the 95 percent confidence interval.

To test for the prevalence of this circumstance, we undertake the following procedure. We take
a sample of those in the earnings database who survived to age 67 and check how many appear
in the benefits database. Almost all Canada Pension Plan retirement benefits claims are made by
age 67 or earlier. If a claim is not made by age 67, we tag the person as a potential ‘permanent
survivor’ since it is unlikely we will observe their death if they are not claiming benefits.
In Figure B4 we show the proportion tagged as permanent survivors for men and women by decade

of birth and age 45-49 earnings ventile. For men, the problem recedes quickly after the 5th ventile
while for women it fades more slowly. The incidence falls by half between the 1920s and 1930s.
Not shown here are those born in the 1940s and 1950s for whom the incidence is negligible.
We next examine the impact of the permanent survivors on our survival rates by graphing the age
75 survival rate for samples where we only include those who survived to age 67. This analysis
appears in Figure B5. In the ‘Earnings and Benefits’ sample we look at the survival rates for those
who appear in both the earnings database and the benefit database. The baseline sample has
anyone appearing in the earnings database. For women, the differences between the Earnings and
Benefits and the Baseline samples are negligible. For men, there is a difference of ten percentage
points in the lowest ventile for the 1920s. The difference shrinks by the 5th ventile, and is less

Gompertz projections
Figure B6: Gompertz Projections for 10th Ventile Males

Note: Data are from the OCA administrative file of the Canada Pension Plan. The solid lines show log mortality
in our data for males in the indicated birth cohorts. The dashed lines trace the Gompertz projection.

We project mortality rates for some ages when they are unavailable in the data. The projection
makes use of Gompertz Law (see Gompertz, 1825), which asserts that the relationship between
age and mortality is log-linear. Here we demonstrate the fit of Gompertz Law to our data and
how we adjust the projections. First, in Figure B6 we graph the relationship between age and log
mortality by birth year for 10th decile males. The solid lines show the data and the dashed lines
are the regression-imputed projections. For the 1923-1925 birth cohort we have data up to age 90,
and the fit is very tight. For the 1953-1955 birth cohort we only have data up to age 60, leaving
the projection more variable.

Note: Data are from the OCA administrative file of the Canada Pension Plan. The solid lines show log mortality
in our data for males in the indicated birth cohorts. The dashed lines trace the Gompertz projection.

In the next graph, Figure B7 shows the results for different birth cohorts for males at ventile 1
and ventile 20. We use data only up to age 75 to make the projections. The Gompertz projections
appear to perform well for the 1940 birth cohort. For the 1925 birth cohorts, the data begins to
depart from the Gompertz projection after age 75. Investigating this across birth cohorts reveals
this is related to the Permanent Survivors issue discussed above, mostly affecting male low-ventiles
in the 1920s.

Note: Data are from the OCA administrative file of the Canada Pension Plan. The three lines for men and women
show age 75 survival for different sorts into ventiles. The three sorts are based on average earnings in the indicated
time period windows. Shaded area indicates the 95 percent confidence interval.

Appendix: Measurement of lifetime earnings
Averaging period

Our main results are based on average income between the ages of 45 and 49. Here, we investigate
the sensitivity of our results to changing this averaging window. In Figure C1 we plot the age 75
survival for 1930s-born men and women using three different averaging windows: one year (age
49), five years (age 45-49) and ten years (age 40-49).30 In all cases we impose the same earnings
requirement of four years of positive earnings between the ages of 45 and 49 in order to maintain
a consistent sample. The results show very little sensitivity to the averaging window.
The lack of sensitivity relates to the mobility of individuals within their cohort earnings distribution
30 See

Cristia (2007) for a comparison of different averaging periods using U.S. data.

as they age. To look deeper, we examined a sample of men in the fifth decile of the 1953-55 cohort’s
earnings distribution based on age 45-49 average earnings, and then examined what deciles they
belonged to based on their average earnings at age 35-39 and age 40-44. The resulting crosstabulations are provided in Table C1. While there appears to be considerable mobility in the
cohort-based earnings distribution, a large portion of individuals remain in the same decile as they
age. Of those in the fifth decile based on age 45-49 earnings, nearly one third were in the 5th decile
based on age 40-44 earnings and 22 percent were in the 5th decile based on age 35-39 earnings.
Moving far away from the fifth decile (to the first or ninth-tenth deciles) is quite rare.

Chetty et al. (2016) use a one-year family income measure to index families in their analysis. Our
results here lend support to their assumption that mid-life income is stable enough to support
using only a one-year averaging window to examine the income-mortality relationship.

Appendix: Additional results
Self-employment

Our data reports income earned through employment and through self-employment for each year,
which we sum for our definition of annual earnings. To assess the sensitivity of our results to this

Figure D1: Age 75 Survival for Samples without Self-Employed Individuals

Note: Data are from the OCA administrative file of the Canada Pension Plan. The ‘No Self-Employed’ sample
excludes those with any years of self-employment income, while the baseline sample does not. Earnings ventiles are
characterized by the average earnings observed between ages 45-49. Those born in 1930s included here. Shaded
areas indicate 95 percent confidence intervals.

choice, we graph in Figure D1 the age 75 survival rate for men and women for our baseline sample
and a sample which excludes anyone with self-employment income in any year. We show the results
by ventile assigned by average earnings from age 45-49. The figure uses all Canadians born in the
1930s. The survival rates for women are indistinguishable, while for men survival rates below the
8th ventile are higher in our baseline sample than the sample that excludes the self-employed,
suggesting that the self-employed at lower earnings ranges have higher mortality rates than those
with employment earnings.

Figure D2: Age 75 Survival for Samples without Individuals who have claimed Disability Benefits

Note: Data are from the OCA administrative file of the Canada Pension Plan. The ‘No Disabled’ sample excludes
those who ever claimed disability benefits, while the baseline sample does not. Earnings ventiles are characterized
by the average earnings observed between ages 45-49. Those born in 1930s included here. Shaded areas indicate 95
percent confidence intervals.

D.2

Disability

We can observe whether someone claimed disability benefits through the Canada Pension Plan. At
age 65, disability benefit recipients are converted to retirement benefits, so we can observe deaths
that occur during receipt of either of these benefits. In our main sample we include those who go
through disability benefit receipt. In Figure D2 we show the age 75 survival rates for men and
women in our baseline sample and a sample which excludes those who were on disability benefits
at any time. We categorize earnings based on the age 45-49 average using Canadians born in
the 1930s and plot the proportion surviving to age 75 for each ventile for men and women. The
results show a substantial gap between the baseline and the ‘no disabled’ sample, reflecting a lower
survival rate for those who were at some point collecting disability benefits.
