ABSTRACT
This paper provides the first estimates of within-industry heterogeneity in energy and CO2
productivity for the entire U.S. manufacturing sector. We measure energy and CO2 productivity
as output per dollar energy input or per ton CO2 emitted. Three findings emerge. First, within
narrowly defined industries, heterogeneity in energy and CO2 productivity across plants is
enormous. Second, heterogeneity in energy and CO2 productivity exceeds heterogeneity in most
other productivity measures, like labor or total factor productivity. Third, heterogeneity in energy
and CO2 productivity has important implications for environmental policies targeting industries
rather than plants, including technology standards and carbon border adjustments.

This paper provides the first estimates of within-industry heterogeneity in energy and
CO2 productivity for industries spanning the entire U.S. manufacturing sector. We define
energy and CO2 productivity as log dollars of output per dollar of energy input or per ton
of CO2 emitted.1 Three key takeaways emerge. First, within narrowly defined industries,
heterogeneity across plants in energy and CO2 productivity is enormous. For example, given
one dollar of energy inputs, a plant at the 90th percentile of a typical industry’s energy productivity distribution produces 580 percent more output than a plant at the 10th percentile
of the same industry. Second, these values significantly exceed heterogeneity in most other
measures of productivity. For example, the corresponding 90-10 differences for labor and
total factor productivity are 400 percent and 150 percent, respectively. Third, heterogeneity
in energy and CO2 productivity has important implications for industry-based environmental regulations. Many countries have considered pairing a carbon tax on domestic output
with a tariff on imports that is proportional to the carbon content of the imports. We show
that an industry-based carbon tariff, which abstracts from within-industry heterogeneity,
will substantially differ from the correct (plant-level) Pigouvian tax for many plants.
Many existing environmental regulations and standards apply uniformly across plants
within an industry. For example, the U.S. Clean Air Act requires plants in regulated industries and regions to meet an industry-level technology standard by installing “Best Available Control Technologies.” Similarly, the Clean Water Act’s Industrial Effluent Guidelines
require plants to meet an industry-level technology standard. Several tradable permit mar1

Energy and CO2 productivity are the inverse of energy and CO2 intensity. We use the former metric to
facilitate comparisons to other single-factor and total-factor productivity measures.

kets use industry-level rebates to compensate firms.2 Due to substantial data requirements,
researchers and policy makers have a limited understanding of the extent of producer heterogeneity in energy and CO2 productivity. We show that plants within an industry have
very different pollution emissions rates, and therefore, such industry-level regulations will be
too stringent for some plants and too lenient for others.
We use confidential, plant-level data from the U.S. Census of Manufacturers (CM) and
the Manufacturing Energy Consumption Survey (MECS) to explore this heterogeneity. We
distinguish about 375 6-digit NAICS industries. One industry, for example, manufactures
carbon black; another makes ethyl alcohol. Our main results calculate plant-level energy
expenditures on raw fuels and electricity as reported in CM and MECS. We also calculate
plant-level CO2 emissions by converting each fuel consumption choice to CO2 equivalents
using emissions factors (e.g., tons CO2 emitted per ton of coal burned).
A few estimates near the paper’s end analyze carbon tariffs. These estimates account
for energy consumption and emissions required to produce intermediate inputs that are used
for final good production, sometimes called “indirect emissions.” For example, in most of
the paper, emissions for the cookware industry include coal, gas, oil, and electricity used
to shape a pan. Indirect emissions for the cookware industry also include fossil fuels used
to make aluminum, which is then purchased as an intermediate input to make a pan. We
calculate indirect emissions in two separate ways. The first is standard: we invert the U.S.
input-output table to compute the dollars of coal, oil, and natural gas inputs required to
produce a dollar of output in each industry. This accounts for energy used to produce inputs,
and energy used to produce the inputs to inputs, etc. Our second measure of indirect energy
is non-standard: we use plant-level data on the dollar value of each individual material input
the plant uses, along with associated industry codes for each material, which are all part
of the CM Materials Trailer. We combine this information with the inverted input-output

This paper builds on several literatures. One explores the implications of firm heterogeneity for environmental policy and either argues for market-based instruments like pollution
taxes or cap-and-trade markets (Carlson, Burtraw, Cropper, and Palmer, 2000; Goulder
and Parry, 2008) or analyzes industry-based regulation in Melitz-type settings when firms
are heterogeneous (Shapiro and Walker, 2016). Several papers within this literature specifically analyze border adjustments (Cosbey, Droege, Fischer, and Munnnings, 2017; Kortum
and Weisbach, 2017). This paper also relates to work analyzing the efficiency of imperfectly targeted environmental policies (Jacobsen, Knittel, Sallee, and van Benthem, 2017).
A related literature shows that total factor productivity is heterogeneous within narrowlydefined or homogenous industries (Syverson, 2011); other work interprets heterogeneity as
factor misallocation (Hsieh and Klenow, 2009). Existing analysis of heterogeneity in energy
productivity is limited, though includes studies of a subset of energy-intensive, trade-exposed
sectors (Gray and Metcalf, 2017). The remainder of the paper discusses data, methodology,
and results.

1

Data and Methodology

We measure plant-level energy inputs using data from the 2007 CM and the 2006 MECS.
The CM includes about 350,000 U.S. manufacturing plants operating in 2007, while MECS
includes a probabilistic sample of around 15,000 plants. We join MECS and the CM at
the plant level, using a unique plant identifier. Our MECS estimates use survey weights to
make statistics represent the broader manufacturing sector. The CM reports each plant’s
value of shipments, capital stock, production hours, and expenditure on electricity, fuels, and
materials. We exclude “administrative records” since many of their values are imputed. We
also exclude records where output, fuel expenditures, or electricity expenditures are imputed,
or where any variable value exceeds 100 times the 99th percentile of the distribution of values.

3

The CM and MECS both report plant-level expenditure on fuels and on electricity, which
we use to compute CO2 emissions. MECS further reports physical quantities and expenditures for each fuel, which we convert to CO2 (see Appendix for details). Since the CM does
not report expenditures by fuel type, we use MECS to calculate industry-level averages of
CO2 per dollar of fuel expenditure, and we multiply each CM establishment’s fuel expenditure by these averages. For electricity inputs, we use the EPA’s eGrid database, which
assigns annual total output emissions rates (CO2 per KWh) to 26 regions of the country, to
calculate the mean marginal emissions based on plant location of electricity consumption.
We account for indirect emissions only in our estimates of carbon tariffs. We do this in
two separate ways. First, we use the 2007 U.S. benchmark input-output data of the Bureau
of Economic Analysis. We invert the input-output table to compute the total dollars of coal,
oil, and natural gas inputs required to produce a dollar of output in each industry. We apply
emissions coefficients from the Energy Information Agency and Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) to calculate the total CO2 emitted per dollar of output in an industry. Our
second measure of indirect emissions comes from the CM Materials Trailer, which provides
plant-level detail on the dollar value of each material input, along with associated input
industry codes. We multiply these expenditures by the corresponding industry emissions
rate from the inverted input-output table. Thus, while emissions rates are constant across
intermediate input industries, plant-level variation in intermediate input intensity generates
additional heterogeneity in energy and emissions productivity.
We use all these data to construct multiple measures of energy and emissions productivity.
For comparability with common productivity measures, we construct productivity measures
as the log of the value of shipments per dollar of direct energy input, or per metric ton
of CO2 emitted. We also discuss estimates that define productivity as log dollars of value
added per unit of energy input or CO2 emissions in the appendix. We calculate value added
by subtracting expenditures on capital, labor, materials, and energy from the plant’s total
value of shipments.

4

For each industry, we measure productivity heterogeneity by calculating the 90th and
10th percentile of energy and CO2 productivity across plants within the same industry.3 We
also compute the within-industry standard deviation of all productivity measures for each of
the 375 industries. Lastly, we summarize these industry-level dispersion measures by taking
the unweighted mean across all industries. This latter statistic provides some insight on
within-industry heterogeneity in productivity for the mean industry.

Results

Table 1 shows the mean and dispersion of seven different productivity measures. This table
accounts for only “direct” CO2 or other inputs at a plant. Columns 1-6 calculate productivity as the log of the plant’s value of shipments divided by some measure of a plant’s factor
demand, CO2 emissions, or intermediate inputs. Columns 2 and 3 report value of shipments
per ton of CO2 produced, where CO2 is calculated using the CM and MECS samples, respectively. Columns 4-6 report other single factor productivity measures, as indicated in the
column headings. Column 7 presents statistics from a total factor productivity index.4
Panel A of Table 1 shows mean productivity levels. For example, column 1 implies that
energy costs are roughly 1.5 percent of output value (0.015 = 1/ exp(4.16)) for the mean
plant in our sample, since the log of output per dollar energy input is 4.16.5 Panel B of
Table 1 summarizes the industry-level dispersion measures. The first row presents the mean
of the within-industry 90-10 ratio, taken across all industries in our sample. The second row
of Panel B shows the standard deviation of the within-industry 90-10 ratio, taken across all
industries. The third row shows the difference between the 90th percentile industry and the
10th percentile industry of this within-industry 90-10 dispersion measure. Panel C shows
3

To respect confidentiality requirements for 90-10 statistics, we use each industry’s mean and standard
deviation of the respective productivity measure to simulate the 90th and 10th percentile using a normal
distribution. Estimates using the simulated data are nearly identical to those from the underlying microdata.
4
This index uses a Cobb-Douglas production technology with three inputs: labor, capital, and materials.
Output elasticities for each input are constructed from industry-level revenue shares (Syverson, 2011).
5
We report this calculation for energy productivity but not other columns because not all other inputs
are measured in dollars (e.g., labor is in terms of worker hours).

similar values, but using within-industry standard deviations.
Panels B and C of Table 1 show substantial heterogeneity in output per dollar of energy
expenditure or per ton of CO2 emitted, which is the paper’s first main finding. The top-left
entry in Panel B, for example, shows that given a dollar of energy inputs in the industry with
the mean energy productivity dispersion, a plant at the 90th percentile of the within-industry
energy productivity distribution produces 580 percent more output than a plant at the 10th
percentile of that within-industry distribution does. Dispersion in CO2 productivity is even
wider, at 2.27 log points (870 percent difference). The standard deviation of energy and of
CO2 productivity within the average industry is 0.75 to 0.89 log points, respectively.
Panels B and C also show the paper’s second main finding: dispersion in CO2 and energy
productivity is larger than dispersion in most other productivity measures. Both panels show
that dispersion in energy and CO2 productivity is more than twice as large as dispersion in

6

total factor productivity (TFP). Typically, single-factor productivity measures are more dispersed than TFP, but Table 1 shows that dispersion in energy and CO2 productivity exceeds
dispersion in other single-factor productivity measures like labor or material productivity.6
Dispersion in energy and capital productivity is more similar, though worth interpreting
cautiously since the durability of capital investments makes the value of the capital stock
difficult to measure. All pairwise t-tests (not shown for space) reject the hypothesis that
dispersion in energy and CO2 productivity equals dispersion in the other productivity levels.
Appendix Table A1 shows similar conclusions from value added productivity measures.
It may be unsurprising that CO2 productivity varies so much, since differences in fuel
inputs, variation across the grid in the CO2 intensity of electricity generation, and related
forces make CO2 more variable than energy expenditure. It is more surprising that energy
productivity varies more than other single-factor productivity measures, since even though
some fuels are dirtier than others, one might expect plants to use similar amounts of energy
to produce a single unit of output. Panel A of Table 1 shows that mean productivity for
energy and labor are similar, so the difference in dispersion is not driven by scale effects.
Figure 1 demonstrates the paper’s first two conclusions. This graph plots the distribution
of industry-level 90-10 dispersion measures. Each of the roughly 375 observations underlying
one of these lines is an industry; the value of each observation equals the within-industry
90-10 productivity ratio. The mean of the CO2 distribution (dark solid line) lies above the
mean of all other productivity dispersion measures, demonstrating that CO2 dispersion for
the average industry is greater than dispersion in the other productivity measures. The
greater width of the CO2 distribution relative to the TFP and labor distributions shows
that within-industry dispersion in CO2 productivity is more variable across industries than
within-industry dispersion in TFP or labor productivity.
6

The greater dispersion of single factor productivity compared to TFP stems from cross-plant differences
in factor intensities. For example, if one plant has a greater labor share than another plant due to lower local
wages, the two plants may have the same TFP but different labor productivity. Differences across plants in
factor prices (e.g., wages) generally affect single-factor productivity but not TFP (Syverson, 2011).

Implications for Carbon Tariffs
In many countries, policymakers have proposed import tariffs proportional to the carbon
content of imported goods in order to guard against emissions leakage.7 These are often
referred to as carbon border adjustments or carbon tariffs.
Table 2 reports the level and distribution of the external cost of CO2 emissions per dollar
of output. If another country imposed a carbon tariff on imports from the U.S., the social
cost of carbon (SCC) per dollar output provides one measure of the relevant tariff. We
assume a standard SCC of $40 per metric ton of CO2 . Each column represents a different
method of calculating CO2 per dollar of output. Column 1 presents direct emissions from
fuels plus electricity per dollar of output using CM data. Column 2 adds indirect emissions
to the direct emissions estimates from column 1, where indirect emissions are calculated by
inverting the industry-level input-output table.8 Adding industry-level indirect emissions
7

This type of policy was in the Waxman-Markey bill that passed the U.S. House but not the Senate in 2009.
In 2017, France, Mexico, and Canada discussed imposing one on the U.S. after the Trump Administration
announced it was withdrawing from the Paris Treaty on Climate Change. California has just implemented
such a measure for government purchase decisions (the Buy Clean California Act).

Total emissions are the sum of direct and indirect emissions. Direct emissions come from plant-level
data. Indirect emissions come from the input-output table. Note that the input-output table provides both

8

changes the mean externality (Panel A) but not the within-industry dispersion (Panels BC). Column 3 shows the same direct plus indirect emissions estimates from column 2 but
uses MECS rather than CM to measure direct plant-level emissions. While MECS is a
smaller sample than CM, it contains plant-level information on the types of fossil fuels used.
Column 4 replaces the industry-level indirect emissions estimates used in columns 2 and
3 with indirect emissions calculated using the CM Materials Trailer. Column 4 uses plantlevel information on input purchases to calculate indirect emissions. For each input material,
however, it only accounts for the industry average of direct emissions of that input material
and not its indirect emissions. Column 5 is similar to column 4, but for each material input,
it calculates total (not just direct) emissions of each input using the inverted input-output
table. Column 6 is similar to column 5 but uses MECS to measure direct emissions.
Panel A of Table 2 shows that the external cost of CO2 emissions for the mean plant is
2 to 8 percent of product value. Column 2 suggests that a uniform Pigouvian carbon tariff
imposed on imports from U.S. manufacturers should be around 4 percent. In the first row of
Panels B-C, column 2 shows that the mean industry has a 90-10 SCC difference of 0.06. This
implies that even if a carbon tariff were imposed based on industry-specific means instead
of the economy-wide 4 percent, many plants would have a carbon tariff which is well below
the appropriate plant-level tax, whereas others would face a tax rate that is far too high.
Comparing columns 3 and 5 of Panel B shows that using plant-level records of intermediate
good purchases from CM, rather than industry-level records from the input-output table,
approximately doubles both the 90-10 and standard deviation measures of dispersion.
Figure 2 plots the distribution of industry-level 90-10 differences in SCC per dollar output.
This shows the main conclusions from Table 2 visually. Many industries have high 90-10
differences, and this distribution of dispersions has a long right tail which is understated
by our censoring at the 5th and 95th percentile. Thus, a Pigouvian tax based on industry
averages would still miss significant heterogeneity in true SCC per dollar of output.
direct and indirect emissions for an industry. We subtract the industry-level direct emissions from total
industry-level emissions to get our measure of indirect emissions.

Notes: Panel A means and SD are computed from plant-level CM and MECS observations. Panel B
statistics are calculated using the 375 within-industry 90-10 dispersion measures. Panel C statistics are

indirect emissions come from either the BEA I-O table or the CM Material trailer. See text for details.

Detailed analyses of carbon tariffs have noted many challenges, ranging from legal ambiguity to information burdens. This paper uses plant-level data to highlight another tradeoff—
while a plant-specific tariff would impose a large information burden, an industry-level tariff
would have substantial targeting errors stemming from firm heterogeneity.

Discussion and Conclusions

The records used for this paper are the most detailed data we are aware of that cover the
entire U.S. manufacturing sector. The plant-level granularity and detailed information on
plant-level input purchases reveal significant heterogeneity in energy and CO2 productiv-

ity, which exceeds heterogeneity for most other measures of single-factor and total factor
productivity.
However, there are at least three reasons why our approach may understate the true extent of heterogeneity. First, we do not observe the full upstream set of plants that contribute
to final output for a given plant in our data. Instead, we assign industry-level emission and
energy intensities to construct our indirect emission and energy measures.9 If supplying
plants are significantly different in terms of emissions or CO2 productivity, then we would
understate heterogeneity. Second, our productivity estimates are based on revenues and not
quantities. This should lead to underestimates of dispersion since more productive plants
tend to have lower prices. Lastly, by excluding “administrative records” and other imputes
from the CM, we are missing many of the smallest manufacturing establishments which
might contribute to even more within-industry heterogeneity.10
9

Even when we observe plant-level input purchases, we only observe the industry of those inputs and not
the specific plant.
10
It is worth noting that while these reasons suggest we are understating true heterogeneity, any remaining
measurement error after excluding imputed observations could lead to overstatement of true heterogeneity.

11

How large are the welfare consequences of this heterogeneity for policies like technology
standards or carbon tariffs that target industries and not plants? What are the economic
reasons why energy productivity is more widely dispersed than labor or total factor productivity? How would decreasing factor misallocation across firms affect CO2 emissions?
Finally, what does heterogeneity in CO2 productivity imply about heterogeneity in marginal
abatement costs? We leave these important questions for future work.

Notes: Panel A means and SD are computed from plant-level CM and MECS observations. Panel B
statistics are calculated using the 375 within-industry 90-10 dispersion measures. Panel C statistics are
calculated using the 375 within-industry standard deviation measures. Each column computes SCC per
dollar of output using different inputs, as indicated in the column headings and table footers. A column
represents either direct or total emissions, where direct emissions come from either the CM or MECS, and
indirect emissions come from either the BEA I-O table or the CM Material trailer. See text for details.

Direct Energy and Emissions

The main text describes how we construct the analysis sample. Here we describe a few
additional sample restrictions designed to limit measurement error.
For each variable in the raw data, the final sample excludes observations that are more
than 100 times larger than the 99th percentile value. We do not apply this rule to ratios,
e.g., this restriction is applied to CO2 and to output, where output is inventory adjusted,
but not to CO2 productivity. The final sample also excludes plants that report zero or have
missing values for any of our variables,11 and plants that do not report positive values for at
least one material in the materials trailer. Finally, the sample excludes establishments that

In cases where electricity kWh variables are missing in MECS but not CM, we use CM values to calculate
total emissions in MECS.

are unique in their industry after all the above restrictions, since we cannot compute 90-10
dispersions or standard deviations for these industries.
We calculate emissions from fuel use by multiplying each establishment’s consumption
by fuel-specific emissions factors. We assign these emissions factors using data from the
EPA when possible and from the EIA otherwise. We treat acetylene, hydrogen, and waste
and byproduct gases as zero emissions. For emissions from electricity, we assign CO2 per
MWh using the EPA’s eGRID dataset. We match eGRID regions to counties and compute
emissions from electricity at the establishment level by multiplying each establishment’s
electricity consumption with the corresponding emissions factor from eGRID. In cases where
a county overlaps with several eGRID regions, we take an unweighted mean of emissions
intensities across the relevant eGRID regions. For observations in the CM that are missing
the county variable, we take the unweighted mean of emissions factors across counties within
the state. We do not account for process emissions.

Appendix B.2

Indirect Emissions

We use the BEA’s 2007 benchmark Make Table, Use Table, and Import Table to construct
an industry-level input-output (I-O) table. The BEA tables distinguish between industries
and commodities to reflect the fact that some industries produce commodities other than the
primary product of that industry (known as secondary commodities). We use tables after
redefinitions, which in certain cases reallocate secondary commodity outputs to the industry
in which they are the primary product, because this makes industries more homogenous.12
In practice most I-O codes in the benchmark analysis represent both a commodity and an
industry. Exceptions to this are four commodities which are not industries (scrap goods,
non-comparable imports, used and second-hand goods, and rest-of-world adjustment), and
nine industries corresponding to different types of government enterprises. In cases where a
government industry has an analog in private industry – for example federal electric utilities
– the BEA assigns both the public and private industries’ commodity outputs to the private
industry’s commodity code.
The make table is an industry-by-commodity table, with each element mij representing industry i’s output of commodity j, in nominal dollars. The use (and import) tables
are commodity-by-industry tables, with each element uij representing the total (imported)
amount of commodity i used in industry j’s production, also in nominal dollars. In addition
to the commodity-by-industry pairs, the use table contains three value added rows (compensation of employees; taxes on production and imports less subsidies; and gross operating
surplus) and 20 final demand columns. These additional rows and columns play an important role in ensuring that total inputs equal total outputs, but they are not rows or columns
of the final I-O table. The use and import tables are available from the BEA at producer
values and purchaser values – we use producer values throughout to maintain consistency
with the make table. We construct a domestic use table by subtracting import values from
the use table.
The BEA combines crude oil and natural gas extraction into one industry (code 211000).
12

The BEA reallocates secondary output from an industry to the industry in which it is the primary
product when the two industries’ input structures differ significantly

3

We split this industry into two, in order to treat oil and natural gas extraction separately.
We assign all of the petroleum refineries commodity produced by the original industry to
the new crude oil industry, and we assign all of the industrial gas manufacturing commodity
produced by the original industry to the new natural gas industry. The rest of commodity
output is assigned such that total production of gas and crude oil are proportional to their
overall production according to the EIA. We assume that the commodity input mix for each
of the two new industries is the same, with levels proportional to industry output, and we
maintain oil and gas extraction as one commodity.
We normalize elements of the make table by commodity totals to generate a “market
shares” table, in which each element sij is the proportion of commodity j produced by
industry i. Analogously, we normalize elements of the domestic use table by industry totals
to generate a direct requirements table, in which each element dij is the proportion of industry
j’s production made up by commodity i. Because we are interested only in combustible fuel
use, we adjust direct requirements values by proportions of fuel used for combustion using
EIA values.13
We generate the industry level I-O matrix by multiplying the market share matrix by
the direct requirements matrix. The elements of this matrix are how much of each input an
industry uses to produce one dollar of output. Thus equilibrium is defined by:
X = AX + Y
where X is an industry-length vector of gross production, Y is an industry-length vector of
final demand, and A is the I-O matrix. We can rearrange to get
X = (I − A)−1 Y
(I − A)−1 is referred to as the Leontief inverse. Using the Leontief inverse, we can calculate
how much output is necessary in total from every industry to meet a given vector of final
demand.
Thus, we calculate total emissions embedded in the production necessary to meet a unit
of demand for goods from a given industry by left multiplying the Leontief Inverse by a
row vector of the raw emissions intensities for coal, crude oil, and natural gas, which we
get from the EPA. Since we are using CM data to calculate a more granular measure of
direct emissions from production, we calculate indirect embedded emissions by subtracting
emissions from the direct requirements from the total emissions:
X
IndirectEmissionsj = TotalEmissionsj −
(DirectEmissionsj × InputOutputji )
i

where the direct emissions vector is calculated from the total emissions vector, resetting all
values to 0 except those corresponding to utilities and fuel industries.
After creating the BEA-level emissions intensities, we convert from BEA industry definitions to NAICS industry definitions using the concordance provided by the BEA. If multiple
BEA industries correspond to a single NAICS industry, we take BEA output-weighted means
to calculate a unique NAICS industry value. If a BEA industry gets split into multiple NAICS
13

These are calculated as a proportion of first use energy consumption and not total energy consumption.

4

industries, all NAICS industries get the same value. There are several BEA industries that
don’t have corresponding NAICS codes—importantly, the BEA considers government utilities and private utilities separately, and only the private utility gets mapped to a NAICS
utility code.
We use the indirect emissions calculated from the BEA to account for the full embedded
emissions of production in two ways. One is through addition of the intermediate emissions
intensities, by industry, to direct emissions intensities from CM. The second uses the CM
Materials Trailer, which identifies material inputs into production by establishment. We use
the BEA emissions intensity values to calculate the direct and the total emissions embedded
in material inputs. The direct emissions capture the industry averages for emissions from
fuel and electricity use in the production of materials. The indirect emissions use the full
Leontief inverse to capture all emissions generated throughout the economy in the production of the materials, on average by industry. We add these to CM emissions intensities to
calculate two versions of total emissions productivity based on material inputs. In compiling
data from the CM Materials Trailer, we assign zero emissions to unspecified materials inputs
(the “other industry” category). The fact that these “other industry” inputs represent a
reasonable share of all inputs provides another reason why our estimates understate true
dispersion in energy and CO2 productivity.
