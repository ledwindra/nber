    "abstract": "\n\nPrevious studies of event returns surrounding bank mergers show that banks gain value in megamergers and additional value when they absorb in-market competitors.  A portion of these gains has been traced to the increased bargaining power of banks vis-\u00e0-vis regulators and other competitors.  We demonstrate that increased bargaining power of megabanks adversely affects loan customers of the acquired institution. Wealth losses are greater when loan customers are credit-constrained, the loan customer is smaller, or the acquisition is an in-market deal.  These findings reinforce complaints that the ongoing consolidation in banking has unfavorably affected the availability of credit for smaller firms and especially capital-constrained firms.\n\n",
