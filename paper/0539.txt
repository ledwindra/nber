TIME PREFERENCE AND HEALTH: AN EXPLORATORY STUDY

ABSTRACT

This paper reports the results of an exploratory survey
designed to measure differences in time preference across individuals
and to test for relationships between time preference and schooling,

health behaviors, and health status. Approximately 500 adults age 25—64
were surveyed by telephone. Time preference was measured by a series of
six questions asking the respondent to choose between a sum of money

now and a larger sum at a specific point in the future. Approximately
two—thirds gave consistent replies to the six questions. The implicit
interest rate revealed in their replies is weakly correlated with years
of schooling (negative), cigarette smoking (positive), and health status

(negative). Family background, especially religion, appears to be an
important determinant of time preference.

TIME PREFERENCE AND HEALTH: AN EXPLORATORY STUDY
Victor R. Fuchs

Introduction

This paper reports the results of an exploratory effort in a new
area——the relationship between intertemporal choice, health behavior, and

health status. Intertemporal choice (or time preference) is, of course,
a subject much discussed by economists and psychologists.' There is also
a large literature on individual behavior (e.g., cigarette smoking, diet,

exercise) and health status.2 This paper, however, seems to be the first
to attempt to bring these subjects together and to test.empirically for
possible interrelations.

The first section of the paper reviews briefly some of the considerations that suggest that an investigation of time preference might

throw light on health behavior and health status. These include empirical
studies of the relation between schooling and health, epidemiological
investigations of the health effects of cigarette smoking, diet, exercise,
and the like, and theoretical issues concerning investment in human
capital, imperfections in capital markets, and optimizing behavior.
The second section considers the critical problem of the measurement of time preference and reviews some recent efforts by other investi-

gators to measure time preference in contexts other than health. I then
describe a pilot questionnaire given to 500 men and women and present
the results of correlation and regression analyses of their replies. The
paper concludes with a discussion of questions raised by this exploratory
research.

2

Background
Empirical considerations. Cross—sectional studies of the determinants
of health status in the United States usually report a strong association

between health and years of schooling. This result typically appears
regardless of whether health is measured objectively (e.g., mortality rates)
or subjectively (e.g., self—evaluation), and is equally robust in studies
of differences across groups (e.g., states or cities) or across individuals

(e.g., household survey data). Simple correlations between health and
years of schooling are usually significant in both the statistical and

the practical sense. Furthermore, the relation remains strong after
controlling for other variables such as income.

Probably the most thorough investigation of this relationship has
been carried out by Michael Grossman in "The Correlation between Health

and Schooling" [1975]. This study of middle—aged men is particularly
notable for two reasons.
First, a statistically significant effect of schooling on health
remains after controlling for a large number of other variables, including
family background, health status in high school, income, job satisfaction,
and scores on physical and mental tests taken by the men when they were
in their early twenties.

Second, all of the men had at least a high school diploma; the

mean level of schooling was over 15 years. Grossman's finding that the
favorable effects of additional schooling persist even at high levels of
schooling is in sharp contrast to the relation between income and health,
which is positive at low levels of income but seems to be much weaker or
nonexistent at average or high levels [Auster, Leveson and Sarachek, 1969].

3

While the relationship between schooling and health seems well
established, the mechanism(s) through which schooling affects health is

less clear. Grossman has interpreted the empirical results as support
for a household production function model; additional years of schooling

make the individual a more efficient producer of health. This efficiency
may come through wiser use of medical care or, what is more likely,
through differences in cigarette smoking, diet, and other elements of
"life style."

The view that "the greatest potential for improving the health of
the American people . .

. is

to be found in what people do and don't do

to and for themselves" [Fuchs, 1967] has gained widespread acceptance in
recent years as the result of numerous studies by epidemiologists and

social scientists interested in health.2 These studies report significant
differences in health status and in life expectancy associated with such

factors as cigarette smoking, diet, and exercise. Not only is a statistical
correlation well established, but in many instances there is some understanding of the causal mechanisms as well, e.g., the role of diet and

exercise in the prevention of atherosclerosis. What is not understood
at all well is the cause of individual variation in health—related behavior.
From an economic point of view many of these behaviors have a
common characteristic——they involve trade—of fs between current costs and

future benefits. The costs may be purely psychic, such as the loss of

pleasure from not eating a rich dessert or not smoking a cigarette. They
may involve time, such as time for jogging, or they may involve other

costs including financial and nonfinancial resources. The expected
benefits typically take the form of reductions in the probability of
morbidity and mortality from one or more diseases sometime in the future.

4

Theoretical considerations. The acceptance of a current cost for
a future benefit constitutes an investment. Becker's development of the
theory of investment in human capital [Becker, 19641 and Grossman's
application of this theory specifically to health [Grossman, 1972] provide

a convenient framework for thinking about these health behaviors. Suppose
individuals differ in their willingness or ability to undertake investments,

i.e., they have different time preferences. Such differences might help

to explain variations in cigarette smoking, diet, and the like. Furthermore, this approach suggests possible links with the health—schooling
relationship that has been found by so many investigators.
There are at least two ways that individual variation in time
preference could explain the correlation between schooling and health.3
First, suppose that differences in time preference are established early

in life, are relatively stable, and affect subsequent behavior.4 These
differences might be due to differences in the education or income of
parents, the stability of the family, the values associated with different

religions, or to other background characteristics. Given variation in time
preference, it would not be surprising to observe that individuals with
low rates of time discount would invest in many years of schooling and

would also invest in health—enhancing activities. On this view schooling
has no direct effect on health; the observed correlation is due to both
schooling and health being functions of time preference.
A second possibility (.the two explanations are not mutually

exclusive) is that schooling actually affects time preference; those with

more schooling are more willing to invest at a lower rate of return.5
Thus more schooling could result in better health by increasing investments

5a

in health. The empirical portion of this paper, based on a single cross—
section survey, cannot distinguish between these two hypotheses, but we
can test for possible relations between schooling and time preference.
Empirical investigation of time preference through survey questions
designed to elicit marginal rates of time discount depends critically on

capital markets being "imperfect." If capital markets were "perfect"
(i.e., if individuals could borrow and lend without limit at a single
market rate of interest) marginal rates would be equal for all regardless

of time preference. Differences across individuals in time preference
might still result in differences in non—tradeable health—related
activities, but these would not be predictable from the replies to

interest rate questions. However, if capital markets are not "perfect"
(an assumption of this paper), individuals may well have different rates
of interest at the margin and these may be related to health behavior
and health status.

Let us imagine a two—period world. Suppose utility in each period
depends upon consumption of goods (G). Utility in the first period also
is a function of some activity C1 (for simplicity assumed to be free with
respect to G) which affects health (and therefore utility) in period two.
For example, C1 might be cigarette smoking:

U1 = U1(G1,

C1)

U2 = U2(C2,

H2) where H2 = H(C1)

A wealth compensated increase in the rate of interest (r) will,

ceteris paribus, alter the allocation of wealth between C1 and C2. But if

5b

the marginal utility of C1 depends on the quantity of G1 (and the marginal
utility of H2 depends on the quantity of C2), the change in r will also

affect C1 (and H2). If C1 and C1 (and C2 and H2) are substitutes, an
increase in r will lead to an increase in C1 and a decrease in H2.

If the

relationship is complementary (which seems less plausible to me), the
reverse would be true.
It should be eniphasized that (given imperfect capital markets)

differences across individuals in marginal rates of interest can be the
result of differences in underlying preference functions (indifference

curves) or differences in opportunities to borrow and lend.6 In general,
it will not be possible to distinguish between these sources empirically,
although controlling for family income (as a proxy for "opportunities")
may move the analysis somewhat closer to a focus on preference functions
per Se.

Because time preference is probably only one of many factors
affecting the demand for cigarettes, jogging, etc., we can hardly expect

perfect correlation among these activities. Differences in time preference
across individuals, however, should result in some positive correlations
among various health—related behaviors.

6

Measurement of Time Preference
In recent years there have been several attempts to measure time

preference through household survey techniques. The objectives of the
investigators have varied greatly, but the general approach has been similar.
The respondent is typically confronted with a hypothetical situation
involving different sums of money at different points in time and is asked
to express a preference which will implicitly reveal a rate of time dis-

count. A brief review of four such studies follows.
Thomas and Ward [1979]. Psychologists Ewart A. C. Thomas and
Wanda E. Ward were interested in looking for relations between time preference and various psychological measures of temporal orientation? and

measures of optimism or pessimism. They were also interested in possible
effects of time preference on saving and spending behavior. Their sample
consisted of 63 college students who were asked 24 "open ended" time
preference questions of the following type:
If offered $100 now or X dollars in six months, what would
be the smallest amount of money (X dollars) you would accept
rather than the immediately available $100?
Some questions gave the future amount and asked the respondent to choose
a current value; others gave both amounts and asked for the time period

that would make them commensurate. Still others were formulated as payments

7

rather than as receipts, and some were expressed in terms of goods rather
than simply dollar amounts.

Implicit discount rates were found to be negatively correlated
with future time orientation and positively correlated with "big spending."
The group results were considered satisfactory, but the measurement of
time preference was "disappointing" to the authors because of the "high
instability of parameter estimates for individual subjects."

West (SRI) (1978). Economists involved in the Seattle—Denver
income maintenance experiment were interested in time preference because
the bias introduced by the finite length of the experiment (compared to a
national program of indefinite life) would vary depending upon the house-

hold's rate of time discount [Metcalf, 1974]. The families in the
experiment (more than 1500 in each city) were asked a large number and

variety of time preference questions. Some were open—ended, similar to
those of Thomas and Ward. Some were "cascades" of the following type:
Suppose you had a choice between a cash bonus of $100 today
and $200 a year from now; which would you choose?
If the respondent chooses $200, the question is repeated, with $175 substi-

tuted for $200, and so on until the respondent chooses $100. Some cascade
questions go up instead of down; some involve payments rather than receipts;
and some involve different time periods.

The mean interest rates implicit in the replies of these low income
respondents were typically quite high, but the correlation between questions
was typically low (r =

about .1 or .2). The author (Richard W. West)

expressed some concern that "the measures are not reliable" (p. 23).

Maital and Maital [1978]. A paper by an economist and a psychologist, Shlomo Maital and Sharona Maital, reviews some of the economic

8

and psychological literature on time preference and reports the results

of a survey of 515 Israeli adults. The Maitals' focus is on the role of
time preference in the intergenerational transmission of income inequality.
They asked one cascade question involving choice between a sum of money

now and higher sums one year from now. A similar question in which gift
certificates for a week's shopping at a supermarket were substituted for
money was asked in an attempt to measure the "real" as opposed to the
nominal implicit rate of interest.
The implicit interest rate was negatively correlated with years of
schooling (r = — .08) and with a dummy variable which took a value of one if

the subject and the subject's father were born in Israel (r = —.12).

The

nominal rate was negatively correlated with income (r = —.14), but the

real rate was not. The authors concluded that the ability to defer
gratification is part of the process of socialization and that "after
adolescence the propensity to delay gratification is quite stable" (p. 192).
This may be correct, but it is not clear that the conclusion follows from
their results.

Thaler (1979). In a questionnaire administered8 to approximately
75 college students, Richard Thaler posed a large number of open—ended
money choices primarily to learn how the implicit interest rate varies
with the amount of money involved, the time period, the starting point of

the comparison, and whether the choice involves receipt or payment. He
found that the implicit rate was lower the larger the amount of money and
the longer the time period.

Also, choices involving two points both in

the future typically invoked a smaller implicit interest rate than choices
involving the present versus the future. He concluded that there is a

9

"psychic fixed cost" to waiting, as well as a cost that varies with amount
and time.

I included a few questions on health status in the Thaler questionnaire and found a significant negative correlation between health and

median implicit interest rate across individuals. This result led me to
undertake a larger pilot survey described in the next section.

The Pilot Survey

A pilot survey was conducted in November 1979 under the direction
of Stephen and Ann Cole with the objective of measuring time preference,
health status, and health behavior as well as a large number of family
9

background and current socioeconomic variables.

Telephone interviews

approximately 20 minutes in length were conducted with 508 individuals
living in Nassau and Suffolk Counties (on Long Island just east of New

York City). Respondents were selected through a random sample of telephone
numbers;10 interviews were completed with 58 percent of the eligible

respondents. The characteristics of the respondents conformed closely to
Census data for those two counties, but the possibility of selection bias
remains, especially with respect to some of the family background variables.
The sample was restricted to individuals aged 25—64, and interviewers were instructed to obtain an approximately equal distribution

between female and male respondents. The respondents differ from a national
sample with respect to religion (55 percent Catholic and 17 percent Jewish),
race (3 percent Black), and schooling (about one year above the national

average). They are also somewhat more affluent and in slightly better

10

health. Allowing for the predominantly suburban middle—class character
of the two counties, the distributions of replies on the health, health
behavior, family background, and socioeconomic variables conform closely
to those obtained in national surveys.

The principal approach to the measurement of time preference was
through a series of six questions asking the respondent to choose between
a sum of money now and a larger sum at a specific point in the

future,

e.g., "Would you choose $1500 now or $4,000 in five years?" The amount
and the time period varied, as did the interest rate implicit ikn each

question. The lowest implicit rate was 10.1 percent per annum (continuously compounded); the highest was 51.1 percent. This dichotomous choice
type of question was used because it was deemed simpler for the respondent
than the open—ended or cascade type questions discussed previously.12
In addition to the implicit interest rate series of questions, a
cascade type question with an explicit interest rate (beginning at 6 per-

cent and rising to 50 percent) was asked. The survey also included four
attitudinal questions, e.g., "Do you agree or disagree with this statement:
It makes more sense to spend your money now rather than saving it for the

future." Also, each respondent was asked to choose an expected rate of

change of prices for the coming year. The final time preference questions
dealt with the respondent's use of credit when purchasing a car or through
unpaid balances on bank credit cards.
The questions dealing with family background, socioeconomic status,

health behavior and health status are similar to those usually asked in

household surveys. Only some of these variables have been analyzed thus
far. They will be discussed in the next section on empirical results.

11

Empirical Results
One of the purposes of the pilot survey was to determine whether
respondents would, in a brief telephone interview, give sensible answers
to hypothetical money choice questions when the interest rates implicit

in the questions are far from transparent. The data presented in Table 1
suggest that many respondents do give sensible replies; some do not. The
six implicit interest rate questions ask the respondent to choose between

taking a smaller prize now or waiting for a larger prize. A priori we
expect the fraction of respondents taking the prize now to diminish as

the implicit interest rate rises. Table 1 shows that this did occur.
For the sample as a whole, 76 percent chose "now" for the question with
an implicit interest rate of 10.1 percent per annum, and only 33 percent
did so when the implicit interest rate was 51.1 percent.
Not only do the group results conform to a priori expectations,
but almost two—thirds of the respondents gave replies which were internally
"consistent" for each individual. A set of replies was defined as consistent

if the respondent never answered "now" to a question with an implicit interest rate thatwas higher than the rate in another question to which the answer

was "wait."13 The last three columns of Table 1 show results for the
sample divided into three groups: those with consistent answers, those
whose answers would be consistent if one reply were reversed (about one—
fourth of the sample), and those respondents whose replies require two
or three reversals in order to achieve consistency (about 10 percent of

the sample).14 The relation between the fraction taking the prize now
and the implicit interest rate is much weaker for those respondents with
inconsistent answers and much stronger for those with consistent answers.

Most of the results reported in this paper are based on analyses limited
to those respondents with consistent replies.
Table 2 presents the results of regressions in which each question

to each individual is treated as an observation. When the regressions are
run OLS, the dependent variable is dichotomous, taking a value of 1 if the

reply is "now" and 0 if it is "wait." The right—hand—side variables are
the compound interest rate implicit in each question, the simple implicit
interest rate, and the individual's explicit interest rate given in reply

to the cascade question mentioned in the previous section. We see that
the probability that a given individual will reply "now" to a given
question falls sharply as the interest rate implicit in the question rises,

and rises rapidly as the individual's explicit interest rate rises. These
results hold for the entire sample and are particularly strong for those
respondents classified as consistent, but do not hold for the other

respondents. Logistic regressions estimated by a maximum likelihood
procedure give similar results when evaluated at the mean probability

of taking "now." (See marginal effects in brackets.)
The contrast between the compound interest rate and the simple
interest rate coefficients, depending upon the consistency class, suggests

one possible reason why some respondents give inconsistent replies)5 The
two interest rates are, of course, highly correlated, but not perfectly so.
Those giving consistent replies seem to have been influenced by the implicit
compound rate, while those with the most inconsistent replies seem to have

been influenced primarily by the simple rate. We also see that there is
a close connection between the explicit rate and the probability of choosing
"now" for the consistent individuals, but not for those whose replies to
the implicit rate questions were inconsistent.

14

Inasmuch as these results are based on replies to only six ques-

tions, they can only be suggestive, not definitive. It would be desirable
to see if the distinction between the compound and simple interest rate

holds up in a survey based on a large number of questions. For this
sample, this distinction gives stronger results than do regressions based
on Thaler's hypotheses about the effects of length of time or amount of
money on the willingness to wait.

Table 3 reports the results of regressions similar to those in
Table 2, but designed to measure the effects of individual characteristics
on the probability of the individual choosing "now" in response to the

implicit interest rate questions. The regressions are limited to
respondents with consistent replies and are run separately for females
and males because preliminary analysis revealed significant interaction

effects for some variables. A brief discussion of the additional
variables follows:

AGE: Respondents placed themselves in one of four age categories:
25—34, 35—44, 45—54, or 55—64. The mid—point of each category
was used to

construct

a continuous variable. There was no

a priori expectation for this variable. Maital and Maital had
found a positive correlation between age and the "real" interest
rate (r =

.10),

but no relation with the nominal rate.

PARED: Parents' education is the mean of the years of schooling of the
respondent's mother and father. The separate schooling
variables are highly correlated, and do not yield any signif i—

cant information when included separately. A priori I expected
a negative coefficient for PARED, at least prior to inclusion

3.

of other variables that are also affected by PARED, e.g., the
respondent's own years of schooling.

LIVPAR: This is a dummy variable taking a value of 1 if the respondent

lived with both parents until age 16; 0 otherwise. Some of
the psychological literature suggest that this coefficient
should be negative, i.e., should work much the same way as PARED.

CATH,JEW: These are dummy variables taking a value of 1 if the respondent
is Catholic (or Jewish), and 0 if Protestant or other.

EXINFL: Expected inflation is a continuous variable derived from the
respondent's reply to the question about expected price change

during the coming year. A positive coefficient is expected
when the implicit interest rate is held constant. At any given
nominal rate, the respondent should be less willing to wait if
prices are expected to rise rapidly because the implicit "real"
rate of interest is lower.

l2YRS These are dummy variables for the respondent's own years of
and
l6YRS: schooling. The omitted class is those with 13 to 15 years. A
positive coefficient is expected for l2YRS, and a negative
one for l6YRS, for reasons discussed in the first section of
this paper.

ADJINC: Adjusted family income is a continuous variable derived as
follows. The respondent placed total family income in one of

the following categories: under $15,000, $15,000 to $25,000,
$25,000 to $35,000, or over $35,000. Values of 10, 20, 30 and
40 were assigned to each category. Sixty of the respondents
did not answer the income question. An income category was

17

assigned to them on the basis of their reply to a social class

question and a regression of income on social class. Total
family income was divided by "adult equivalents" to create

adjusted family income. "Adult equivalents" is the weighted sum
of the number of adults and the number of children in the house-

hold with the following weights: respondent = 1; each additional adult =

.8;

additional child =

first child =

.3.

.5;

second child =

.4;

each

A negative coefficient was expected for

ADJINC both because of a possible effect of income on time
preference, and an effect of time preference on income.'6
Three alternative OLS specifications (for each sex) allow us to
look first only at the background variables (controlling for the implicit
interest rate and expected inflation), then at the effects of schooling
(which is probably affected by the family background variables and may be
a route through which they affect time preference), and finally at the

effect of family income. The regressions were also estimated in logistic
form by maximum likelihood; the results are similar to those for OLS. The
coefficients from the logistic version of the third specification, converted

to marginal effects at the mean probability of taking "now" are shown in
column (3L).

In the first specification, AGE and PARED are statistically
significant for males in the expected direction, while JEW is highly

significant for females. A coefficient of —.22 indicates that, ceteris
paribus, a Jewish female respondent has .22 lower probability of answering

"now" than does a Protestent (or other) female. The sign of the LIVPAR
coefficient is opposite to that expected, perhaps because of sample

18

selection bias. It may be that most persons from broken homes do have
high rates of time discount, but those who "make it" to a middle class
suburban community are probably atypical and may have low rates of time
discount.

The schooling variables behave as expected for females and are

highly significant. For males, the 12YRS coefficient is as expected,
but the l6YRS coefficient has the "wrong" sign and is statistically
significant. It is not obvious why men with 16 years of schooling or more
should be, ceteris paAibus, more eager to take the prize now than men with
13 to 15 years; possibly the former have better opportunities to invest
the money.

The income variable works as expected for females and is signifi-

cant; it has the wrong sign for males but is not significant. In the
fullest specification, LIVPAR and PARED are statistically significant for

females with signs opposite to that expected. Some of the background and
socioeconomic variables are highly correlated with one another (see
Appendix Table A for the zero order correlation matrix) and multicollinearity

may explain some of the perverse results. EXINFL is statistically significant in the expected direction and has approximately the same effect as
the nominal implicit interest rate on the probability of taking the prize
now.

The model underlying the regressions reported in Table 3 treats
time preference (as reflected in the choice between "now" and "wait") as

dependent on years of schooling. As previously discussed, some writers
believe that differences in time preference are established early in life

and are stable. They would treat years of schooling as dependent on time

19

preference. Table 4 presents the results of regressions in which years
of schooling is regressed on time preference and other variables. The
new variables are:
IMPINT:

An implicit interest rate is calculated for each

respondent who gave consistent answers to the six implicit interest rate

questions. Those respondents who answered "now" to some questions and
"wait" to others were assigned a rate equal to the mean of the highest
implicit rate to which they answered "now" and the lowest to which they

answered "wait."17 Those respondents who always chose to "wait" were
assigned a rate of 5 percent and those who always chose "now" were assigned

60 percent. The higher the respondent's IMPINT, the lower should be the

years of schooling. The variable EXINFL (described previously) should
work in the opposite direction.

HSRANK: The respondent's scholastic performance in high school
was inferred from replies to the question: "When you were in high school
were you: (percent of sample in each category shown in parentheses)

1) an excellent student (10%)
2) an above average student (28%)
3) an average student (57%)
4) a below average student (5%).
Grade averages of 95, 85, 75, and 65 were assigned to the four categories

respectively, and the variable is treated as a continuous variable. A
positive coefficient is expected.
HSHLTH:

Health in high school was treated as a dummy variable

taking a value of 1 if the respondent recalled his or her health as being
"better than most of the other kids" (26%), and 0 if it was "about average"

(70%) or "worse than most of the other kids" (4%). A positive coefficient
is also expected for this variable.
The results of these regressions again give weak support for the
view that there is a relation between time preference and schooling, but

leave open the question of the direction of the causality. In the first
specification the coefficient of IMPINT is highly significant for females
and is still significant when the family background variables are introduced.

EXINFL has the wrong sign and is not significant. For males the reverse
is true. EXINFL is significant with the expected sign, but IMPINT shows
no effect.

The background variables work as expected, with PARED and LIVPAR

both raising years of schooling. HSRANK has a very strong effect, but the
causality may be partly the reverse of that assumed in this regression,
i.e., persons who plan to go on to college may exert more effort to do

well in high school. HSHLTH shows practically no effect on years of
schooling. In general, this variable has very low correlations with other
socioeconomic or health variables, suggesting that it may be poorly
measured.

One of the purposes of the pilot survey was to determine the
correlation among alternative measures of time preference. These correlation
coefficients, shown in Table 5, indicate a weak but statistically significant correlation between the implicit and explicit interest rates and
between the implicit rate and replies to the two simple attitudinal

questions ("spend now" and "don't worry"). The other two attitudinal
questions, which are more complex because they introduce considerations
such as life insurance and the education of children, do not correlate

22

well with either the implicit or explicit rates, although they are correlated

with each other. The fact that the credit card debit and car loan dummy
variables are not significantly correlated with the interest rate variables
would be disturbing, but given the timing of the pilot survey, there may

be an easy explanation. The interest rates on these loans were legally
restricted to unrealistically low levels, given the high interest rates
prevailing at that time and given the high rates revealed by the respondents
in replies to the implicit rate questions.

Explanations aside, the low correlations across time preference

questions must be a source of some concern. They suggest the need for
further refinement in the survey techniques and the need to understand
better how the specific context of a decision affects intertemporal choice.
Do differences in time preference affect investments in health?
Some crude measures of these investments were obtained by asking the
respondents about their cigarette smoking, dental visits, exercise,
weight (as a proxy for diet) and seat belt usage.
Replies to questions about these behaviors were converted to

The correlation between favorable health behaviors is positive for every

possible pair (reversing signs where appropriate), but the coefficients
are quite low and only some are statistically significant (see Table 6).
The correlations with seat belt usage suggest that individual differences
with respect to health in general may be more important than differences

in time preference. Moreover, the generally low correlations underscore
the fact that even if there is a common factor at work across behaviors,
there are also other factors that are specific to particular behaviors.
The low coefficients may also be attributable to the rough approximations
used to measure the variables.

In order to test for possible effects of time preference, the
health behavior variables were regressed on IMPINT, EXINFL, and several

other variables. The results for cigarette smoking are reported in
Table 7. They confirm the expectation that cigarette smoking does increase
with higher IMPINT, and decrease with higher EXINFL, but the size of the

effect of IMPINT is quite small. We also see an effect of schooling on
cigarette smoking as expected; the difference between the coefficients

for l2YRS and 16YRS is statistically significant for males. The overall
explanatory power of the regression is low; most of the variation in
cigarette smoking is not explained by these variables and the addition of
ADJINC was of little value.
Regressions for the other health behaviors were even less satis-

factory. The total explanatory power was low, and IMPINT was not
statistically significant except for EXER for males, where the sign was
the opposite of that expected.

In the first section of this paper questions were raised about
whether difference in time preference could help explain health status or

throw light on the relation between health status and schooling. Table 8

reports the results of regressions addressed to these questions. Panel A
uses as the dependent variable LnHLTH, the same variable used by Grossman

[1975] in "The Correlation between Health and Schooling." It is obtained
by taking the logarithms of values given to replies to the question "In

Grossman obtained these values from a regression of work—loss weeks due
to illness on self evaluation of health status.'8
The results support Grossman's finding of a strong effect of
schooling on health and it appears that the effect is equally strong for
females and males.'9 The coefficients for EMPINT have the expected negative
sign, but are not statistically significant. When time preference and
schooling are entered simultaneously, the latter clearly dominates the

former. When ADJINC is added to the regression, its coefficient is not
significant, and the other results are unchanged.
Three other sets of health status questions were asked in addition

to the subjective self—evaluation. One used a checklist of symptoms and
diagnoses; a second requested information on utilization of hospitals,
drugs, and physicians' services; and the third asked about the respondent's

ability to walk or jog a mile. These measures are significantly correlated
with each other and with self—evaluation of health status, even after

27

controlling for age and sex (partial correlation coefficients are typically

about .20). A composite health status variable MNEXHLTH was calculated
from the four measures by assigning a value of .25 to respondents for each
of the following:

(1) Self—evaluation excellent (44%)

(2) Zero symptoms (47%)
20

(3) Very low medical care utilization

(64/a)

(4) Able to jog a mile (61%)
This "mean proportion of excellent health measures" is the dependent

variable in the regressions reported in Part B of Table 8. They indicate a
stronger effect for time preference and a relatively weaker effect for
schooling.21 IMPINT actually achieves statistical significance for males.

It appears that the choice of health status measure makes a difference.

Unresolved Questions
This exploratory study leaves unresolved many empirical and
theoretical questions concerning time preference, health behavior, and

health status. The attempt to measure implicit interest rates through a
series of six dichotomous choices between "money now" and "money in the
future" produced answers that are clearly not all "noise," but neither

are they completely satisfactory. About one—third of the respondents had
at least one inconsistent reply. Moreover, one—half of those who were
"consistent" answered all the questions the same way (either all "now"

or all "wait"). An extension of the range of the implicit interest rates
might yield more information about this group. An increase in the number
of questions would be desirable for many reasons, but the directors of
the survey believe that six is about all the respondents will tolerate
as part of the total telephone interview.

At a time of sharply rising prices, the measurement of "real"
vs. "nominal" interest rates presents a major problem which is solved
only partially by including a question on expected inflation. The EXINFL
variable usually works as expected——opposite to INPINT——but the

coefficients are not always equal, and sometimes the signs are
inconsistent.

The mean implicit interest rate in this survey of 30 percent per
annum is substantially lower than the rates reported in surveys by other

investigators. This rate is still high, however, compared to current
borrowing and lending rates, and high compared to the mean response to

the explicit interest rate question (14 percent). Wh the difference?
Also, although the implicit and explicit rates are significantly
correlated (r = .23 for the two—thirds of the sample with consistent
replies), why isn't the correlation higher?
The pilot survey confirms our a priori expectation of a correlation between schooling and time preference, but other types of data are
needed if we are to learn something about the direction of the causality.
The effect of time preference on health behavior and on health status is
usually in the expected direction, but is not always statistically
significant, and even when statistically significant the size of the

effect is frequently small. This may be partly the result of errors in
the measurement of time preference but may also indicate weaknesses in
specification of the model.

For instance, the assumption that investment behavior is affected

only by time preference is probably unrealistic. Investments typically
involve uncertainty as well as time preference because future values of

30

any variable, whether it be the price of a stock or the state of health,

cannot be known with certainty. Thus, individual attitudes toward risk

will also affect investment behavior. The uncertainty element is
probably particularly large in the case of investments in health such as
giving up cigarettes, eliminating fatty foods, jogging, and the like.
Even the best information available indicates only the average expected
benefit from such health investments; the return to any individual is

highly uncertain. Only a minority of cigarette smokers will actually
contract lung cancer, while giving up cigarette smoking does not provide

a guarantee against the disease. Therefore, individual differences with
respect to uncertainty can also affect health investment and health status.
Psychologists Kahneman and Tversky, In their highly original and
provocative work on prospect theory [1979], have suggested that most
individuals prefer certain to uncertain gains, but prefer uncertainty to

certainty with respect to losses. For example, most individuals, when
offered a choice between A) a certain gain of $500 or B) an equal chance

to win $1,000 or nothing, will choose A. The same individuals, when
offered a choice between A) a certain loss of $500 or B) an equal chance
to lose $1,000 or nothing, will choose B.

Such asymmetry in risk aversion, if applicable to health—related

behavior, could be important. Consider a person contemplating giving up
some current pleasurable activity or undertaking an unpleasant one in
return for the chance of an improvement in health status sometime in the

future. The immediate action involves a loss with a high degree of
certainty, but the future gain Is quite uncertain for the individual even
though it may be highly predictable, on average, for a large population.

31

Thus, the stronger the individual's asymmetry with respect to uncertainty
(as described by Kahneman and Tversky), the less likely will he or she

undertake the health—enhancing action. This conclusion is unaltered if
one reverses the "framing" of the decision and thinks of the current
activity such as cigarette smoking as a "gain" (where certainty is
preferred) and the possibility of ill health in the future as the "loss."
Thus, individual differences in risk aversion may confound attempts to
measure time preference or to analyze the effects of time preference on
health.

This survey and the analyses reported here also highlight problems

of measurement of health status and health investment. When health is
measured by subjective self—evaluation, the results are different from
those that are obtained when a composite health measure based on self—
evaluation, medical care utilization, symptoms and physical ability is

used. Problems in the measurement of health investment surface when we
examine a variable like exercise. It seems as if exercise is undertaken
for many reasons other than to improve health. These other reasons may
swamp an effect of time preference.

Perhaps more detailed questions

concerning the type and intensity of exercise would help.
I conclude this report of exploratory research on a note of

cautious optimism. Crude but useful measures of time preference, health
investment, and health status can be obtained, even through very inexpensive

telephone interviews. Time preference is related to schooling, and also
shows some relation to health investment and health status. However,
none of the relationships found in these data are particularly strong.
Whether improvements in survey design, more accurate measurement of
variables, and better specification of models will produce more significant
results remains to be determined.

3. There are, to be sure, many other possible explanations for
the correlation between schooling and health. For instance, persons with
better health endowments may be more efficient in schooling activities,
or their expected rate of return to schooling may be higher because of

their greater life expectancy. Conversely, the rate of return to
investment in health may be greater for those who have had more schooling.
This paper does not address all possible explanations; it focuses on
differences in time preference.

Regression 2 in Table 8, Part A, had a coefficient of .035 for schooling
and —.017 for age.

20. No hospitalization in past year, no prescription drugs in
past week, no medical condition requiring regular visits to physician,

and fewer than three visits to physician in past six months. To be sure,
medical care utilization may reflect factors such as income and insurance
coverage as well as health status.

21. The weak effect of schooling is attributable to the "symptoms"
and "utilization" measures of health status. When these measures are used
as dummy dependent variables in regressions equivalent to (3) in Table 8,
schooling is negatively (albeit not significantly) related to good health.
