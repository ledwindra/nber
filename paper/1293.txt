Effects of Expected Future Government
Deficits on Current Economic Activity
ABSTRACT

This paper considers that possibility that expected
future government deficits directly affect economic decisions,
in particular the decisions of the Federal Reserve.

Some

evidence is presented in Section II that indicates that the

behavior of the Fed may be influenced by expected future deficits.
The economic consequences of this behavior are examined in Section

III. The results in this section show that fiscal policy is less
effective if the Fed responds to expected future deficits than

otherwise. Quantitative estimates of the differences in fiscal—
policy effects are presented,

EFFECTS OF EXPECTED FUTURE GOVERNMENT DEFICITS
ON CURRENT ECONOMIC ACTIVITY*

by
Ray C. Fair

I. Introduction
There has recently been considerable discussion about current and

expected future federal government budget deficits. While many people are
worried about the large size of the deficits, there is little clarity about

the ways in which the deficits affect the economy. One obvious answer is
that the deficits have no direct effects on individual and government

decisions, that they are merely the consequence of these decisions. In
a typical macroeconometric model, for example, the government surplus or
deficit is determined by an identity, and it does not appear as an explan-

atory variable in any of the stochastic equations. If this is all there
is to it, one should not worry about the deficits per Se. One should
merely be concerned about the standard target variables like real output,
the rate of inflation, the unemployment rate, and the size of the capital
stock.

The purpose of this paper is to consider the possibility that expected future government deficits directly affect economic decisions, in

particular the decisions of the Federal Reserve. Some evidence is presented
in Section II that indicates that the behavior of the Fed may be influenced

by expected future deficits. The economic consequences of this behavior
are examined in Section III.

II. Fed Behavior
The question considered in this section is whether expected future

government deficits affect Fed behavior. I have an equation in my U.S.
macroeconometric model (Fair (1984)) that explains Fed behavior. This
equation is an interest rate reaction function. It is a ?!leaning against
the wind" equation in the sense that as real economic activity or inflation
or money supply growth increases, the Fed is estimated to respond to this

by raising short term interest rates. The hypothesis that Fed behavior
is

also influenced by expected future

variable

measuring

deficits can be tested by adding a

expected future deficits to this equation. If the var-

iable is significant, this is evidence in favor of the hypothesis.

Let Dt be the ratio of the federal government deficit (NIA defi-

nition) to GNP in quarter t

(both in current dollars).1 This is the

measure of the size of the deficit used in this study. Let D÷1 denote
the Fed's expected value of Dt+1 (i =

is

0,

1, .., ) ,

where

Since the interest rate reaction function is part of a complete

model, one could consider estimating the entire model by full information
maximum likelihood (FIML) under the assumption that the expectations of

the Fed are rational. All the equations in the model would be the same
except for the interest rate reaction function, which would have the additional variable

on the right hand side, where i

of time. Given a set of expectations of future exogenous-variable values
for each quarter of the estimation period, the method in Fair and Taylor
(1983) could be used to obtain the FIML estimates. .(The simplest assump-

tion about exogenous-variable expectations is to assume that the expected
values are the actual values, although other assumptions are possible.)
Under the assumption that the Fed is using my model in forming its expectations of future deficits, the FIML estimates account for all the nonlinear
restrictions that are implied by the rational expectations hypothesis.
The constraints built into the estimation procedure are that the FedTs expectations of the future deficits (given the exogenous-variable expecta-

tions) are the model's predictions. One could estimate the model for

alternative values of i to see which choices, if any, resulted in a

significant estimate of the coefficient of D1
The Fair-Taylor method is expensive for a model of my size (30 stochastic equations and 98 identities), and no attempt has been made to use

it here. Instead, the limited information methods of Hayashi and Sims
(1983) and Hansen (1982) have been used to estimate the interest rate re-

action function. Because these methods are recent and have not been widely
used, the exact steps that were followed to apply the methods in the present
case will be explained.

The interest rate reaction function is nonlinear in variables but
linear in coefficients, and so it can be written

Computing bus is straightforward once an estimate of V is avail-

able. Given V ,

the data set used in Fair (1984). This data set contains observations for
the 1952 I - 1982 III period, and the basic estimation period in Fair (1984)

was 1954 I -1982 III. In the present case the estimation period must end
in 1981 III rather than in 1982 III because the last four quarters of the
data set are needed for the observations for

Dt÷4

Equation 1 in Table 1 is the regular version of the reaction func-

tion, estimated by 2SLS. The first stage regressors that were used for
the estimation are listed in Table 6-1 in Fair (1984). Thirty-six vari-

ables were used. They represent the main predetermined variables in the

model. Equation 2 in Table 1 has Dt+4 added to it. It has been estimated
by 2SLS. For these estimates and for the estimates of equations 3-6, two
variables have been added to the set of first stage regressors:

D2 . Although

Dtl and

the estimates of equation 2 are consistent under standard

assumptions, the estimated standard errors and

thus

the t-statistics are

wrong because the addition of Dt+4 has introduced serial correlation into
the error term.

Equation 3 is the same as equation 2 except that it has been estimated by the HS method under the assumption of a moving average error term

of order 4. These estimates have accounted for the serial correlation properties of the error term. Equation 4 is the same as equation 2 except that
it has been estimatedby Hansen's method. The general way of estimating

M for Hansen's method (for J = 4

)

did

not result in a positive definite

matrix (a not uncommon problem), and so estimates for this case could not

be obtained. The alternative way discussed above of estimating M (again

for J =

4

)

did

result in a positive definite matrix, and the estimates

for Hansen's method in Table 1 are based on this estimate of M

.

These

estimates have also accounted for the serial correlation properties of the

10

error term.

All summary statistics in Table 1 (SE, R2, and DW) are based on es-

timates of u. ,

not

of some transformation of

u .

In

other words, the

transformations that are implicit in the HS and Hansen methods were not
used in calculating the estimated error terms for the summary statistics.
The coefficient estimates for equation 1 are similar to those in Fair
(1984). The main difference that the loss of the last four observations has
made is that the coefficient estimate of the inflation variable

Pb. has

been lowered from .0687 to .0478, and the t-statistic has been lowered from
2.11 to 1.40 (see equation 30 in Fair (1984) for the original estimates).
The coefficient estimates for equations 2, 3, and 4 are similar.

All show that

is significant by conventional standards. Although

the t-statistics in equation 2 are not correct, the bias seems to be fairly

small in this case. Likewise, the differences between the results for the
HS method and Hansen's method seem small.

The introduction of Dt+4 to the equation has essentially lowered

the coefficient estimate of Pb to zero. The effects on the other coefficients are smaller, and all estimates are significant in equations 3 and

4 except for those for Pb .

The coefficient estimate of 22.1 for Dt+4

in equation 3 means that the one-period impact on the short term interest
rate of an increase in the deficit of 1 percent of GNP is 22.1 basis points.
The long-run impact is 22.1/(1 - .885) = 192.2 basis points, or about 2 percentage points.

Since the estimates of the coefficient of

PDt in equations 3 and

4 are of the wrong sign and highly insignificant, the equations were re-

estimated with Pb

dropped.

These equations are 5 and 6 in Table 1.

It is clear that dropping PDt has had little effect on the other

11

coefficient estimates.

The value of the lead for D that gave the best results was 4.

It is interesting to note that the use of Dt or Dt1 in place of
results in coefficient estimates of the D variable that are insignificant

and of the wrong sign. The coefficient estimate for Dt was -7.3 with a
t-statistic of 1.05, and the coefficient estimate for Dti was -3.6 with
a -t-statistic of 0.55.
2SLS.

(The estimation technique in these two cases was

and Dt1 were entered separately.) There is thus no evidence

that the Fed responds to the current or lagged value of the deficit.
In summary, the results seem supportive of the hypothesis that ex-

pected future deficits affect Fed behavior. The expected future deficit
variable is significant in the interest rate reaction function. The results
are, however, quite tentative, and they should be taken with considerable

caution. First, I have searched for the value of the lead for D that
gave the best results, and so there is an element of data mining here, which

always warrants caution. Second, this work is based on the assumption that
the interest rate reaction function is an estimate of Fed behavior, and

some may feel that this is not a good approximation. Trying to explain
Fed behavior is more difficult than trying to explain the aggregate behavior
of the household and firm sectors because the Fed is run by a relatively

small number of people. There may be fairly abrupt changes in Fed behavior
if the people with influence change their minds or are replaced by others

with different views. Finally, at the time of this writing the future deficits seem likely to be on average larger than the deficits used for the
estimates in Table 1, and after more time has passed, one will need to reestimate the equation using the new, more extreme data to see if the sig-

nificance of Dt÷4 is retained.

12

III. Fiscal Policy Effects
The question considered in this section is how much difference it
makes to the economy whether or not Fed behavior is affected by expected

future deficits. In particular, the sensitivity of fiscal-policy effects
to alternative assuiptions about Fed behavior is examined. My U.S. model
is used for this purpose. The following is a discussion of the experiments
that were performed.

There are 5 assumptions that can be made about monetary policy
in my model:

1) the short term interest rate exogenous, 2) the money

supply exogenous, 3) nonborrowed reserves exogenous, 4) the amount of
government securities outstanding exogenous, and 5) the interest rate re-

action function used. Under the fifth assumption monetary policy is endogenous. One can examine the sensitivity of fiscal-policy effects to the
alternative monetary policy assumptions, and this has been done in Fair

(1978) and in Chapter 9 in Fair (1984). The results show that fiscal-policy
effects are quite sensitive to the alternative assumptions. The reason
for this is simple. The different assumptions lead to different values
of the short term interest rate for a given fiscal-policy change, and the
short term interest rate has important direct and indirect effects on con-

sumption and investment. The experiments in this paper are concerned with
the sensitivity of fiscal-policy effects to different interest rate reac-

tion functions, in particular to the inclusion of

in the functions.

Three versions of the interest rate reaction functions were used,

all based on the coefficient estimates of equation 5 in Table 1. For the

first version the coefficient of D÷4 was taken to be zero, for the second
version equation 5 was used as is, and for the third version the coefficient

of Dt4 was taken to be half its estimated value. Since the versions are

13

the same except for the coefficient of Dt+4 ,

they

allow one to examine

the differences in fiscal-policy effects that are due solely to how the
Fed reacts to expected future deficits.

The fiscal-policy experiment consisted of a sustained increase in
federal government purchases of goods in real terms of 1.0 percent of real

GNP beginning in 1970 I. The results of this experiment are presented in
Table 2 for selected variables in the model. The row 1 results are for
the reaction function without the deficit variable, and the row 2 and row
3 results are for the reaction function with the deficit variable.

The calculation of the row 1 results is easy to describe. The
actual residuals of the equations were first added to all the equations

in the model and were taken to be exogenous.4 This means that when the
model is solved using the actual values of the exogenous variables, a per-

fect tracking solution is obtained. In other words, the "base" values of
the endogenous variabLes for the experiment are merely the actual values.
The government spending variable was then changed and the model was solved.
The difference between the predicted value of a variable from this solu-

tion and its actual value is the estimate of the response of the variable
to the policy change.

4The actual residuals are the residuals that were computed at the time of
estimation except for the residuals for the interest rate reaction function. For this equation the residual for a given period is the difference
between the actual value of the left hand side variable and the predicted
value computed from the right hand side variables exclusive of the deficit
variable. This allows a perfect tracking solution to be obtained even
though the deficit variable is excluded from the equation. See Fair (1984),
Chapter 9, for a general discussion of the use of perfect tracking solutions in the estimation of policy effects.

The calculation of the row 2 and row 3 results is more involved.
The first problem that must be faced is what to assume about the expecta-

tion formation of the Fed. The assumption behind the estimation work in
Section II is that the Fed uses all the information in the
in forming its expectation of

Z variables

does not have to be assumed that

the Fed uses my model in forming its expectations, only that the

Z var-

iables are among the variables that it uses. When the estimated reaction
function is added to the model (with the expected future deficit variable
among the explanatory variables), a more specific assumption about expec-

tation formation is needed. Two assumptions have been made for the work
here. The first is that the Fed uses my model in forming its expectations,
and the second is that the Fed's expectations of the exogenous variables in

the model are equal to the actual values. These two assumptions imply that

the Fed's expectation of Dt+4 is equal to the model's prediction of it.
In this sense the Fed's expectations are rational.

The solution of the model is more difficult when future variables

like Dt÷4 are among the explanatory variables. What this means is that
future predicted values of the endogenous variables affect current predicted
values, and so the standard way of solving models period by period cannot

be used. One must instead iterate over solution paths of the endogenous
variables. The exact method for doing this is presented in Fair and Taylor
(1983), and

this

is the method that has been used for the row 2 and row 3

results. Unlike the estimation method in Fair and Taylor (1983), which,
as mentioned in Section II, is expensive, the solution method is not very
expensive.

The same fiscal policy experiment was performed for the row -2 and

row 3 results as was performed for the row 1 results. The only difference

16

is that D

t +4

is included in the interest rate reaction function. Perfect

tracking solutions for the experiments were obtained by adding the estimated
residuals to the equations and then taking them to be exogenous.5
One feature of the model should be explained before the results are

described. The long term bond rate and the mortgage rate are linked to the
short term interest rate through standard term structure equations. Each
long term rate is a function of current and past short term rates. Another
possible way that expected future deficits could affect the economy would

be through the term structure equations. In other words, D+ might be
an explanatory variable in the term structure equations. No attempt was
made to test for this here, and so the long term rates merely follow the
short term rate for the present results.
I have experimented with a version of my model in which there are

rational expectations in the bond and stock markets. This work is described
in Fair (1979) and in Chapter 11 in Fair (1984). This version has not been
used for the present results. The results in Chapter 11 show that the timing of fiscal-policy effects is significantly changed by the addition of
rational expectations in the bond and stock markets, but that the total
effects over, say, 12 quarters are only slightly changed.
The following is a brief discussion of the policy effects in the

three versions of the model. Chapter 9 in Fair (1984) contains a much more
extensive discussion of the policy properties of the regular version of
the model (i.e., the version without the deficit variable in the interest

5For the row 2 experiment the residuals used for the interest rate reaction
function are simply the residuals computed at the time of estimation. This
is not true for the row 3 experiment, since the coefficient used for

rate reaction function).

The results in Table 2 are simple to explain. Consider first the
row 1 versus row 2 results. When the federal government increases its
spending, this increases the model's predictions (and thus the Fed's ex-

pectations) of the government's future deficits. For the row 1 results
this has no effect on the Fed's behavior, but for the row 2 results it
leads the Fed to raise the short term interest rate more than it otherwise

would. This results in an increase in the bond rate and (not shown in
Table 2) in the mortgage rate. The higher interest rates for the row 2
results are contractionary, and so the GNP changes are smaller in row 2

than in row 1. The differences are in fact quite large. After three quarters the interest-rate changes in row 2 are about twice the size of those

in row 1. Aftereight quarters real GNP is .79 percent above the base
value in row 1, but .12 percent below the base value in row 2. After 12
quarters the values are .47 above in row 1 and .85 below in row 2. After
12 quarters the GNP deflator is .53 percent higher in row 1, but only .01

percent higher in row 2. The money supply falls much more in row 2 than
in row 1, which is due to the higher interest rates and lower income in
row 2 than in row 1.

The deficit is higher in row 2 than in row 1. There are two main
reasons for this. The first is that tax collections are lower for the row
2 experiment because the economy is less expansionary. The second is that
government interest payments are higher for the row 2 experiment because
interest rates are higher.

The row 3 results are for a coefficient of De
t +4

that is half the

size of the estimated coefficient. As expected, the row 3 results are in

between the row 1 and row 2 results. They are closer to the row 1 results

18

than to the row 2 results, and in this sense the policy responses are non-

linear functions of the coefficient of D4 .

This

nonlinearity is not

surprising since interest rates have a positive effect on the deficit and
the deficit has (with a lead) a positive effect on interest rates.
In summary, the results in Table 2 show that fiscal-policy effects
are quite sensitive to the Fed's response to expected future deficits.
If the Fed does respond to expected future deficits, fiscal policy is less
effective than otherwise.

IV. Conclusion
The evidence in Section II suggests that Fed behavior may be in-

fluenced by expected future deficits. The results in Section III show
that fiscal-policy effects are sensitive to this aspect of Fed behavior.
It should be stressed, however, that these results are based on some strong

assumptions and are highly tentative. The estimation results in Section
II will need to be confirmed using future data before much confidence can

be placed on them. The policy results in Section III are based on the
assumption that the Fed uses my model in forming its expectations of future

deficits, which may not be a good approximation. The overall results of
this paper are thus only suggestive as to what might be the case.

Two final points should be made. The first concerns whether one
thinks of the interest rate reaction as being derived from the solution

of an optimal control problem by the Fed. If the Fed were using my model
for this purpose, it is unlikely that the interest rate reaction function
with the deficit variable added would be a good approximation to the optimal

decision equation. It would require an unusual loss function, given the
model, for the deficit variable to be a variable in the decision equation,

19

although one might argue that the deficit variable is proxying for other

variables. At any rate, if one feels that the estimated interest rate re—
action function is not a good approximation of the optimal decision equation, one must assume either that the Fed does not optimize and only follows
suboptimal rules or that the Fed uses a different model from mine in solv-

ing its control problem. The second assumption is not an attractive one
to make for purposes of this paper because it has been assumed in Section
III that the Fed uses my model in forming its expectations of future defi-

cits. The second assumption would thus imply that the Fed uses my model
for its expected future deficit calculations and uses some other model for

its optimal control calculations. This would only be a good approximation
if my model and the other model had similar properties regarding deficit
predictions.

The second point concerns one other way in which deficits affect
fiscal-policy responses. If the Fed responds to i.

fiscal-policy

expansion

by raising interest rates (which the interest rate reaction function predicts is true even without the deficit variable included), there will be

an increase in interest payments by the federal government. The larger
is the size of the government debt, which is a function of the size of
past deficits, the greater will be the increase in interest payments.

Government interest payments are part of household nonlabor income, and in

my model nonlabor income has a positive effect on consumption. Therefore,
the greater is the government debt, the larger will be the effects from
a given fiscal-policy change if the Fed changes interest rates in response

to the fiscal-policy action. There is, of course, some simultaneity here
in that the Fed will offset some of this increased response by larger

changes in interest rates. This means that in a model like mine interest

20

rates respond more to a given fiscal-policy change the larger have been

past deficits. This is true even if the interest rate reaction function
does not include a deficit variable.
