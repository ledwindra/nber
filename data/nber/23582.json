    "abstract": "\n\nTo show how fast Internet affects employment in Africa, we exploit the gradual arrival of submarine Internet cables on the coast and maps of the terrestrial cable network. Robust difference-in-differences estimates from three datasets covering 12 countries show large positive effects on employment rates\u2014also for less educated worker groups\u2014with little or no job displacement across space. The sample-wide impact is driven by increased employment in higher-skill occupations, but less educated workers\u2019 employment gain less so. Firm level data available for some countries indicate that increased firm entry, productivity, and exporting contribute to higher net job-creation. Average incomes rise.\n\n",
