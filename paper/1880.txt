Country Risk, Asymmetric Information and Domestic Rules

ABSTRACT

This paper describes an economy where incomplete information regarding the
default penalty can result in an upward-sloping supply of' credit. We evaluate
the role of partial information and other related factors in determining the
elasticity of supply of credit and the credit ceiling facing the economy. We
identify conditions under which the presence of country risk induces a
domestic distortion. Next, we derive the cost-minimizing domestic policies
needed in the presence of such a distortion. It is shown that cost-minimizing
policies for a country that wishes to service its debt in the presence of
country risk calls for a combination of borrowing taxes and time varying
consumers have access to the domestic capital
consumption taxes. If
market, the two policies are equivalent. If domestic consumers are subject to
liquidity constraints, cost-minimizing policies call for a combination of time
varying consumption taxes and product subsidies that will mimic the
consumption distribution achieved by cost-minimizing policies in the absence
of liquidity constraints. The policies derived in the paper are formulated in
terms of' the country risk, as embodied in the elasticity of supply of credit
facing the borrower. In a mixed economy, where some consumers are subject to
credit rationing whereas others have full access to the domestic credit
market, there is a need for taxes on borrowing as well as time varying
consumption and production tax cum subsidies. The analysis also shows that if
the level of external borrowing is substantial, cost-minimizing domestic
policies call for instituting a two-tier exchange rate system.

In the 1980's a growing number of countries have found servicing their

debt a challenging task. Countries in balance of payments crises have tended
to impose restrictions on capital mobility, and have adopted various versions

of two—tier exchange rate systems. The growing policy concern with balance of
payments crises has also been reflected in considerable interest in the
factors governing country risk1 and in the role of two—tier exchange rate

systems as means of restricting capital flows.2 The purpose of this paper is
to integrate these two lines of research by analyzing the design of cost-

minimizing domestic policies in the presence of country risk. This paper
derives the characteristics of the supply of credit in a stochastic

environment. The analysis identifies the considerations under which country
risk introduces a domestic distortion. These considerations facilitates the
derivation of the cost-minimizing policies needed to deal with the

distortion. To add a dimension of reality we also examine the effect of an
imperfect domestic capital market on the cost-minimizing policies. Hence, we
specify the cost-minimizing policies applicable to situations with perfect
domestic capital market as well as to situations in which the capital market
•is subject to credit rationing.

Section I formulates a two periods model. Borrowing occurs in period
zero before the realization of the stochastic shocks, and debt repayment is
scheduled for period one.

In case of default, a default penalty is inflicted

upon the borrower. We derive the supply of credit offered by the lender. The

elasticity

of the supply of credit is shown to be determined by the degree of

uncertainty about the size of the (stochastic) default penalty. For "mild"
degree of uncertainty the supply of credit is perfectly elastic up to a credit

ceiling. On the other hand if the uncertainty is substantial, the supply
schedule is composed of three portions. It is perfectly elastic (at the world

2

risk-free rate of interest) for small levels of credit, it is upward sloping
for intermediate credit levels (until the credit ceiling is reached) and it is

completely inelastic at the credit-ceiling level. It might even include a
backwards-bending portion emerging from the credit—ceiling level. The
elasticity of the supply of credit along the upward sloping portion is shown

to rise with the magnitude of the penalty relative to the credit volume. This
elasticity depends negatively on the interest rate. The analysis also
identifies the factors determining the level of the credit ceiling.

In section II we show that if the equilibrium occurs along the upwards
sloping portion of the supply of credit then it results in a domestic

distortion (for a related analysis see Harberger (1980)). This situation
provides the rationale for government intervention .

The distortion arises

from the fact that individual borrowers treat the rate of interest as given
even though from the perspective of the country as a whole the rate of

interest rises with the volume of borrowing. The fact that individual
borrowers do not take account of the rising supply curve implies that from the
social point of view the equilibrium is associated with "excess" borrowing.
The welfare cost induced by the distortion can be eliminated through policies

that reduce the amount of aggregate borrowing. For such policies to be
effective they need to raise the relevant intertemporal cost of current

spending. Such a rise in the intertemporal cost can be achieved by either a
tax on international borrowing, or by a time varying consumption tax (tilted

towards the present) or by a combination of the two. With perfect domestic
capital markets, the two policies are equivalent. These policies internalize
the distortion, created by the "semi monopsony" situation in the financial

market. If the level of external borrowing is substantial (that is, if it
approaches the credit limit level), then the cost-minimizing domestic policies

are equivalent to the adaption of a two—tier exchange rate system. Such

3

policies amount to a combination of a quota on borrowing (equal to the credit

ceiling) and a borrowing tax. This tax equals the percentage spread between
the domestic interest rate ("the demand price") and the foreign interest rate

("the supply price") at the ceiling. This policy captures the 'quota rent'
generated in the presence of credit rationing and prevents the possibility of

an inefficient equilibrium along the backward-bending portion of the supply of
credit.

The substitutability of borrowing taxes with time varying consumption taxes
as cost—minimizing policies is a consequence of the perfect domestic capital
market assumed in section II.

In section III we will relax this assumption,

considering the case where domestic consumers are subject to credit rationing.
Cost—minimizing policies are shown to involve time varying consumption and
production taxes and subsidies at a rate that will imply an intertemporal

transfer of income. This transfer will allow consumers to enjoy the costminimizing allocation of consumption that is attainable with access to the

capital market. A "loan" is granted where subsidies exceed taxes; and a loan is
"serviced" when taxes exceed subsidies. In a way, the authorities are providing
the financial intermediation services of a bank. Cost—minimizing policies allow
the indirect participation of consumers subject to credit rationing in the

financial market. The economic justification for such a role for the public
sector is the presumption that authorities may have a cost advantage over banks

in the provision of financial intermediation for risky consumers. This is
because the authorities can force consumers to service their debt by imposing a

needed set of consumption taxes. In general, the presence of limited domestic
financial integration destroys the equivalence between borrowing taxes and time
varying consumption taxes, putting a greater weight on the second set of

policies. Section IV closes the paper with concluding remarks.

I. Country Risk and Incomplete Information
This section provides an example of the economic factors determining the
supply of credit. We consider a small economy where there is partial

information regarding the costs of default. Debt issuance occurs before the
resolution of uncertainty. Thus, the lender determines the supply of credit
based upon his partial information. The elasticity of the supply of credit
will be shown to be determined by the nature of uncertainty regarding the
borrower's myopia and the penalty size.

Consider a two periods horizon. Borrowing B takes place in period zero,

at

*

a rate r

.

Debt repayment is scheduled for period one. In case of

default a penalty of N/'+ is inflicted upon the borrower. The partial
information stems from the assumption that the lender has only incomplete

information regarding '

.

A

possible economic interpretation of '

is

as

the discount factor applied for a penalty to be inflicted in the future

(period two). Let N be the cost of being excluded from the international
credit market in the future due to a default in period 1; and

be the

effective discount factor that translates the future penalty (N) into N/
in terms of period one. Thus,
higher

can be viewed as a myopia measure, where a

corresponds to a smaller weight attached to the future. For

example, if the default decision is determined by a party whose political
horizon is limited,

will reflect the myopia of the decision maker.

Alternatively, the analysis can apply for the case of partial information

regarding the size of the penalty N: let the default penalty (N) be
proportional to output (or export) in period one. The term

i'

may reflect

a stochastic productivity term.

Default will take place if the penalty falls short of the debt.3

elasticity of supply drops with the interest rate. Furthermore, the main
arguments made in the subsequent analysis are independent of the shape of
f(14))

In the next section we derive the cost minimizing domestic policies for a
small economy operating along the upward sloping portion of the supply of
credit.

II. Optimal Domestic Policies
The purpose of this section is to derive optimal domestic policies in the

presence of the supply characterized by (5). It is useful to start with a
real model, because the design of the optimal policies can be shown to be

independent of monetary considerations. Consider a one-good open economy that
faces given international prices. Let the utility of a representative
consumer be given by

foreign prices are one. Equations (16b) and (16c) are the budget constraints
for period one for the case of no default and default, respectively. To

simplify exposition, we assume that 01 is applied only in case of no
default. Combining (16a) and (16b) yields an intertemporal budget

The specification of the budget constraint embodies the notion that the

consumer is the owner of the claims on output (, ).
The consumer's problem is to allocate consumption so as to maximize his

expected utility subject to the budget constraint. Let V denote the value of
the expected utility. In computing this value, the expectations are taken in
period zero, based upon the information regarding the distribution of '!

In deriving these first-order conditions, we are using

equilibrium.

To close the model, we specify the supply of credit facing the small

country. The determination of the interest rate is represented by a negative

where n was defined in (6).
The value of n reflects the degree of integration of the domestic
economy with the international financial market. Equation (23) implies that
as ri

approaches unity, the economy approaches a credit ceiling under which a

further rise in the interest rate r* does not increase the credit offered to

the country. Alternatively, as n approaches zero we approach the case of
full integration, where the country risk factor is absent. Therefore, a value

of n that is close to one reflects a high degree of financial segmentation

of the domestic economy. For the purpose of our discussion we take n as
given, focusing on the design of optimal domestic policies.

12

The set of optimal policies is derived in two stages. First, we derive
the change in the expected utility of a representative consumer due to a

revenue—neutral change in taxes. e then apply this expression to compute the
implied restrictions on optimal policies. To simplify, we neglect the role of
the public sector; hence we assume that the net revenue of' all taxes and

transfers is zero. Thus, the economy-wide budget constraint implies that:8

assessing the set of optimal policies because optimality requires that the

The tax is designed to capture the rent, preventing it from

being captured by foreigh lenders. This policy can be implemented in the form
of a two-tier regime, where the domestic interest rate is endogenously determined by the spread between the financial and the commercial exchange

rates. Thus, our analysis demonstrates that a two-tier exchange rate can
be the outcome of an equilibrium response of the domestic authorities to
credit rationing by foreign creditors--when a borrower approaches the
inelastic portion of the supply of credit, optimality calls for a borrowing
tax at a rate defined by the spread between the domestic and the foreign

interest rate ((r — r )/r ) . Note that as n-l there is

important role for the quota

--to prevent an equilibrium along the

backward bending portion of the supply of credit. 12

Equation (29) implies that there is a redundancy of an instrument, in the
sense that a tax on borrowing can be substituted by time varying uniform

consumption taxes. This apparent redundancy reflects the assumption that all

consumers have full access to the domestic financial market. We turn now to
an analysis of optimal policies in the presence of credit rationing.

III. Liquidity Constraints
The previous section derived optimal policies in the presence of country
risk for the case where consumers have full access to the domestic capital

market. Sometimes, however, enough consumers face effective credit rationing
to pose the question of what policies might be optimal in the presence of

liquidity constraints. While the economic explanation for the extent to which

15

credit rationing is binding is beyond the scope of the present paper, it is

useful to make the following observations.13 Countries subject to country
risk tend to be countries in which the sophistication of their domestic credit

market is limited. These countries also tend to apply for credit assistance
during severe recessions. Both of the above conditions tend to be associated
with the presence of credit rationing. Thus, it is desirable to assess the
role of domestic policies for the case of country risk and liquidity
constraints.

Suppose that the consumer described in Section II is facing credit

rationing. As a consequence, he faces distinct periodic budget constraints,

denoted by BC:

The terms H0, R include terms related to the intertemporal transfer of
income allowed by the existing level of credit offered to the consumer. What
is relevant, however, is that at the margin our consumer is effectively

rationed in the credit market. For simplicity of exposition, we consider the

case where H0 H z 0 .

The public sector chooses the set of taxes cum

subsidies as to maximize the expected utility of a representative consumer.

Formally, this is equivalent to optimizing equation (18) subject to the budget

constraint (2L) and the external supply of credit (22). We can obtain the
optimal policies by applying the two stages procedure used in section II.

Notice that equation (25) still holds as a measure of the change in utility
due to marginal change in policies. Note also that equation (27), the

16

economy-wide budget constraint, is still valid. Applying (27) to (25) yields

A comparison of the conditions for an optimal path of taxes between the cases

of liquidity constraint (31') and full access to the domestic financial market
(29') reveals that liquidity constraints destroy the equivalence between time
varying consumption taxes (and production subsidies) and taxes on

borrowings. For a consumer subject to credit rationing, taxes on borrowing
are not relevant because they do not affect his behavior. Thus, the presence
of credit rationing implies that the optimal intertemporal allocation should
be achieved via uniform, time varying consumption and production taxes and

subsidies. The optimal set of policies would mimic the intertemporal
allocation of consumption for a consumer with access to the domestic financial
market. This can be accomplished by applying taxes cuzn subsidies as a means

17

of intertemporal transfer of income. In designing such a policy, the public
sector provides the intermediation services of a bank to consumers who are

excluded from the credit market. A "loan" is granted where subsidies exceed
taxes, and the loan is "serviced" when taxes exceed subsidies. The economic
justification for such a role for the public sector is the implicit assumption
that the authorities have a cost advantage over banks in the provision of

financial intermediation for risky consumers. This is because the authorities
can force consumers to service their debt by imposing a needed set of

consumption taxes. Thus, the argument for the application of the optimal
policies described above necessitates a sound fiscal system with the capacity
to enforce taxes.

The above arguments are illustrated with the following Cobb-Douglas

model. Let the utility of a representative consumer be given by:

We consider now the case where the consumer lacks access to financial

markets. If (La, ) stands for the endowment vector, equation (18)

Thus,

if the first

term is zero, the intertemporal distribution of endowment coincides with the
desired distribution of consumption, whereas a negative value reflects an

endowment bias towards period one. Equation (35) implies that the inter—
temporal path of net taxes is determined by country risk and by the endowment

bias. Assuming that the design of taxes O,

In such a case, no policies are

Thus, optimal policies call for a net subsidy in period zero and a net tax in

period one. Such a policy transfers income from period one to period zero.
This is also the case in which a consumer who has access to the credit market
borrows in period zero.

16

Suppose now that the transitory drop in income in period zero comes with

a rise in country risk (n). Higher country risk weakens the use of the
subsidy cum tax scheme as a means of intertemporal transfer of income. This
is also the case in which borrowing by the consumers who have access to the

credit market should be taxed. In general, optimal policies allow the consumer who is subject to credit rationing to use the credit market indirectly
in order to smooth the path of consumption over time.

It is relevant to note that in a mixed economy, where some consumers are
subject to liquidity constraints, whereas others have full access to the

domestic credit market, there is a need for taxes on borrowing as well as for

time varying consumption cum production taxes and subsidies. In such a case
(31) defines the path of consumption curn production taxes, and (29) defines

the borrowing tax that is consistent with the path of consumption taxes.17
A potential difficulty of our analysis in this section is the lack of
additional channels that allow a consumer subject to credit rationing to

smooth consumption. These channels include investment in productive capital
and the presence of money. It can be shown that the main results remain
intact in the presence of these channels. Finally, while our discussion was
formulated in terms of a one good model, it can also be varified that (because
optimal policies do not affect within-period relative prices) all the results
regarding optimal policies hold for a two (or ri) goods model.18

IV. Concluding Remarks
Rather than repeating the summary from the introduction, we conclude with

an outline of possible extensions. Throughout the paper we have evaluated the
conditions under which the presence of country risk can introduce a domestic
distortion, and we have studied the implied characteristics of the supply of

credit and the optimal domestic policies. We considered a simple example in
which there is incomplete information regarding the default penalty. The
present paper does not allow for the possibility of a direct feedback between

the borrower's policies and the evaluation of the country risk. An extension
that allows for such a possibility would be useful, bringing up issues related
to credibility and reputation.
