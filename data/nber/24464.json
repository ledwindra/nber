    "abstract": "\n\nThis study explores how a major public policy change\u2014the implementation of welfare reform in the U.S. in the 1990s\u2014shaped the age gradient in female crime. We used FBI arrest data to investigate the age-patterning of the effects of welfare reform on women\u2019s arrests for property crime, the type of crime women are most likely to commit and that welfare reform has been shown to affect. We found that women\u2019s property crime arrest rates declined over the age span; that welfare reform led to an overall reduction in adult women\u2019s property crime arrests of about 4%, with the strongest effects for women ages 25\u201329 and in their 40s; that the effects were slightly stronger in states with stricter work incentives; and that the effects were much stronger in states with high criminal justice expenditures and staffing. The key contributions of this study are the focus on a broad and relevant policy-based \u201cturning point\u201d (change in circumstances that can lead people to launch or desist from criminal careers), addressing the general question of how a turning point shapes age gradients in criminal behavior, and the focus on women in the context of the age patterning of crime.\n\n",
