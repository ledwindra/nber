Racial Sorting and the Emergence of Segregation in American Cities
Allison Shertzer and Randall P. Walsh
NBER Working Paper No. 22077
March 2016, Revised June 2018
JEL No. J15,N32,R23
ABSTRACT
Residential segregation by race grew sharply during the early twentieth century as black migrants
from the South arrived in northern cities. The existing literature emphasizes collective action by
whites to restrict where blacks could live as the driving force behind this rapid rise in segregation.
Using newly assembled neighborhood-level data, we instead focus on the role of “flight” by
whites, providing the first systematic evidence on the impact of prewar population dynamics
within cities on the emergence of the American ghetto. Leveraging exogenous changes in
neighborhood racial composition, we show that white departures in response to black arrivals
were quantitatively large and accelerated between 1900 and 1930. Our preferred estimates
suggest that white flight can explain 34 percent of the increase in segregation over the 1910s and
50 percent over the 1920s. A key implication of these findings is that segregation could have
arisen solely as a consequence of flight behavior by whites.

Introduction
Among the most durable and salient features of American urban life, residential

segregation has been implicated in a wide variety of social ills. As a result, the question of how
cities first came to be segregated, and how that segregation has been sustained, has received
widespread attention in both economics and the social sciences more broadly. Economists tend to
emphasize two classes of mechanisms that could generate segregation: collective action by
whites that raises the costs to blacks of migrating into white neighborhoods; and white flight,
whereby whites vacate neighborhoods experiencing black in-migration and select into higherpriced neighborhoods that blacks generally cannot afford.
The patterns of segregation that typify the American ghetto were largely established prior
to World War II. 2 While there is strong evidence that white flight from center cities to the
suburbs was a particularly important factor in the entrenchment of these high levels of
segregation during the postwar era (Boustan, 2010), there is little empirical evidence on the role
of white flight prior to the war. During this period’s rapid rise in segregation, which occurred
prior to the opening of the suburbs, flight would necessarily have transpired at the neighborhood
level as whites departed city blocks experiencing black in-migration for other areas inside the
city that were expected to remain racially homogenous.
This lack of evidence on intra-city sorting sets the context for the current literature, which
argues that these decentralized mechanisms were not very important in explaining the
establishment of segregation in the early twentieth century. In their seminal work, Massey and
Denton vividly describe coordinated house bombings of recently arrived black families and the

century increase in dissimilarity and 63 percent of their increase in isolation by 1930.

formation of neighborhood “improvement” associations that existed solely to maintain the color
line with restrictive covenants (1993). Similarly, Cutler, Glaeser, and Vigdor point to blackwhite rent differentials in the 1940 census as evidence supporting the importance of institutional
barriers in establishing the black ghetto (1999). These works lend support to the mainstream
view among social scientists that, during early waves of the Great Migration, segregation grew
out of collective action by whites that sought to restrict the location choices of blacks.
Yet, none of the extant evidence precludes the possibility that white flight might have
been significant and altered the racial geography of cities in important ways during the early
twentieth century. In this paper we provide the first empirical investigation of the impact of
urban population dynamics on the emergence of racial segregation in prewar American
neighborhoods. Our findings demonstrate that white flight at the neighborhood level was
occurring as early as the 1910s, decades before the opening of the suburbs in most cities.
Furthermore, white households were sorting away from black arrivals when many formal and
informal institutional alternatives to “protecting the neighborhood” were common and often
legal. In contrast, our results suggest that far from being a postwar phenomenon, white flight was
integral to the rise of segregation in American cities. To illustrate this point, we conclude our
empirical work with a counterfactual exercise demonstrating that, due to the estimated
magnitude of flight behavior, segregation would have emerged in American cities even if blacks
had faced far fewer barriers in the housing market.
The lack of panel data covering early twentieth century neighborhoods largely explains
the paucity of prior research on prewar population dynamics. We address this limitation by
constructing a fine-grained, spatially-identified demographic dataset covering ten of the largest
northern cities in 1900, 1910, 1920, and 1930. Our empirical work begins by identifying a causal

3

link between black in-migration and white flight. We utilize exogenous changes in
neighborhood-level black populations that we isolate by interacting variation in the state-level
out-migration rates of blacks with within-city cross-neighborhood variation in the state of origin
of early black arrivals. This approach facilitates the exploration of neighborhood-level
population dynamics. 3
Our analysis provides clear evidence of white flight from blacks in the early twentieth
century; moreover, the flight effect appears to accelerate over the three decades we study.
Results from a naive OLS analysis find one black arrival in the preceding decade associated with
.9 and 1.5 white departures during the 1910s and 1920s, respectively. Of course, these OLS
results fail to account for endogeneity concerns and could for instance be explained solely by the
one-for-one replacement of white movers by black migrants in an environment with inelastic
housing supply. However, our instrumental variables analysis, which assigns estimated statelevel black outflows from southern states to northern neighborhoods according to black
settlement patterns prior to the Great Migration, indicates that one exogenous black arrival was
associated with 1.9 white departures in the 1910s and 3.4 white departures during the 1920s.
These IV results suggest that OLS estimates were biased against a finding of flight, likely due to
both white and black settlement being drawn to generally growing neighborhoods.
In the second portion of our analysis, we construct a series of counterfactual exercises
aimed at understanding how much of the observed increase in segregation over the 1900 to 1930
period can be attributed to white flight from black arrivals in the absence of institutional barriers
constructed by whites. The most striking finding is the sharp increase in the contribution of flight
in each subsequent decade. While our preferred estimates suggest that white flight was

A related issue is the question of housing price or rent dynamics during this period. Unfortunately, we are aware of
no source for systematic spatially delineated data on prewar housing prices or rents.

4

inconsequential during the 1900s, we estimate that flight can explain 34 percent of the increase
in segregation (as measured by dissimilarity) over the 1910s and 50 percent of the increase over
the 1920s. The impact of flight in the latter decade is particularly important given that the 1920s
saw the largest increase in segregation of any decade in the twentieth century.
Our finding that sorting by whites out of neighborhoods with growing black populations
was a quantitatively important phenomenon in the prewar decades of the twentieth century is
novel. To be clear, these results do not call into question the presence of widespread collective
action by whites, about which the historical record is quite clear. They do, however, suggest that
segregation would likely have arisen even without the presence of discriminatory institutions as a
direct consequence of the widespread and decentralized relocation decisions of white individuals
within an urban area. Whites likely would have responded to policies that reduced barriers to
black settlement in their vicinity by accelerating their departure for neighborhoods within the
city that were at lower risk of “encroachment.” Policies that reduce barriers faced by blacks in
the housing market may thus not prevent or reverse segregation as long as white households have
a desire to avoid black neighbors or concerns about the quality of public goods and amenities in
neighborhoods experiencing racial turnover.
The paper proceeds as follows: Section II reviews the historical context for the black
migration from the South and neighborhood population dynamics in northern cities. Section III
discusses the construction of the dataset used in this paper. Section IV details our empirical
approaches for measuring white flight and Section V presents our results. Section VI relates our
finding to the observed increase in segregation. Section VII concludes.

Background on Segregation and Urbanization in the United States

A. Historical Background on the Great Migration
5

Scholars have long argued that the groundwork of the black ghetto was laid during the
first decades of the twentieth century as black populations in northern cities grew, leading to the
sharp increase in the racial segregation of neighborhoods. African Americans migration to
northern cities began to accelerate on the eve of World War I, an event that brought European
immigration to a temporary halt while simultaneously increasing demand for industrial
production. These wartime developments in the northern labor market coincided with the arrival
of the Mexican boll weevil in Mississippi and Alabama (1913 and 1916, respectively), which
devastated cotton crops and led to a decline in demand for black tenant farmers (Grossman,
1991). This combination of push and pull factors led to unprecedented out-migration from the
South: 525,000 blacks came to the North in the 1910s while 877,000 came in the 1920s (Farley
and Allen, 1987).
Cities were growing at an unprecedented rate during these initial decades of the twentieth
century, but black migrants from the South were just one source of urban population growth.
European immigrants were numerically more important, particularly prior to the implementation
of the first National Immigration Act in 1921. Segregation thus emerged against a backdrop of
rapid urbanization, in contrast to the postwar era, which saw significant suburbanization and
declines in urban populations. The share of the population residing in central cities grew from 14
to 33 percent between 1880 and 1930, leveling off subsequently. 4 Cities grew from a
combination of increasing density and due to the annexation and development of outlying areas.
In our sample, the population density of the average urban neighborhood in increased by 68
percent between 1900 and 1930 (see Table 1). 5

4

This computation uses the center city status variable from IPUMs samples for 1880 to 1930.
Manhattan is the one exception. This borough actually lost population during the 1920s. Our neighborhood
boundaries are defined to be time invariant. As a result, none of this reported growth is related to annexations or
growth of city boundaries.

While our empirical analysis will focus on the urban core of our sample cities,
developments in the periphery are important for understanding our results. Although some
“streetcar suburbs” existed by 1910, white flight in this period can primarily be thought of as
departures for neighborhoods further away from the downtown but still within city boundaries.
Public transit became cheaper over this period with the proliferation of electric streetcars,
subways, and, towards the end of the period, the widespread adoption of the private automobile.
Thus, the cost of departing neighborhoods at risk of racial turnover decreased over this period.
Of course, white homeowners who wished to live in a racially homogenous neighborhood
could also choose to fight black arrivals using a host of methods, including violence, restrictive
covenants, or appeals to the city government to pass a racial zoning ordinance. The latter option
was invalidated by the 1917 Supreme Court case Buchanan v. Warley, which ruled that racial
zoning laws interfered with the property rights of landowners. 6 Restrictive covenants remained
enforceable until 1948, and existing empirical work has found that these institutions were
effective in constraining where blacks could live (Kucheva and Sander, 2010). Violence and
related threats are difficult to study, but a large body of qualitative research has argued that such
behaviors on the part of white urban residents had a profound impact on where African
Americans lived. Historians have documented that in Chicago, one black home was bombed on
average each month between 1917 and 1921 (Drake and Cayton, 1970, pp. 178-179). Thus,
while some mechanisms used to deter black settlement became legally unavailable during the
first decades of the early twentieth century, others were still very much in use. Our results can
thus be thought of as examining the extent of white flight in a period when transport costs were

assistance, was not a factor prior to the 1934 passage of the National Housing Act.

declining and collective action by whites to maintain the color line remained commonplace.
B. The Rise of Segregation in the United States
We begin our empirical analysis by confirming the extant understanding of this rise in
segregation levels using our newly constructed spatial data set. We measure segregation using
the two most common indices of segregation: isolation and dissimilarity. A standard isolation
index measures the percent black in the neighborhood of the average black resident; we follow
Cutler, Glaeser, and Vidgor (1997) and compute a modified index which controls for the fact that
under the standard approach there is a potential for the index to be highly sensitive to changes in
the overall group share. Our second segregation measure is the dissimilarity index (Duncan and
Duncan, 1955). This index ranges from zero to one with one representing the highest degree of
dissimilarity between where whites and blacks in a city reside. Intuitively, the index reveals what
share of the black (or white) population would need to relocate in order for both races to be
evenly distributed across a city.
The Cutler et al. segregation indices are presented in Figure 1. They were constructed
using ward-level data for censuses prior to 1940 (this is the year when census tract data became
widely available) and tract-level data in later decades. To make the ward and tract-level data
comparable, Cutler et al. estimate the relationship between tract-level and ward-level indices in
1940 and then use the estimated 1940 relationship to rescale the ward-level estimates in earlier
years. Using our new enumeration district level data (discussed below in Section III), we
compute these same segregation measures over the 1900 to 1930 timeframe at both the
enumeration district and ward level and report the results in Figure 2. As expected given their
smaller scale, enumeration district-level segregation indices are markedly higher than those
computed at the ward level (the average enumeration district had 1,400 individuals while wards
8

could have as many as 100,000 residents in large cities). However, the trends in ward and
enumeration district segregation are nearly parallel, showing a steep increase between 1900 and
1930.
These figures underscore how crucial these early decades were for the emergence of
racial residential segregation in America. 7 In the first three decades of the twentieth century, the
ten northern U.S. cities we study in this paper experienced 97 percent of their overall twentieth
century increase in dissimilarity and 63 percent of their increase in isolation. 8 We note that large
cities, which received proportionally larger black inflows in the prewar decades, attained their
peak level of residential segregation by race earlier in the twentieth century than did smaller
urban areas in the North. For instance, Cutler, Glaeser, and Vigdor find that segregation
continued to increase markedly after 1930 for their more comprehensive sample of northern
cities.
III.

Enumeration District Data for 1900 to 1930
The analysis in this paper is based on a new enumeration district-level spatial dataset

spanning the years 1900 through 1930. 9 There are two major components to this data: censusderived microdata retrieved from Ancestry.com and digitized enumeration district maps. The
census-derived microdata cover 100 percent of the population of ten large cities over four census
years. For the twentieth century decades (1900, 1910, 1920, and 1930) we collected the universe
of census records for Baltimore, Boston, Cincinnati, Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, New York City

7

This sharp increase in northern urban segregation occurred against a backdrop of nationally rising segregation
levels: recent work using a household-level measure finds that segregation levels doubled between 1880 and 1940
(Logan and Parman, 2017).
8
Isolation peaked in 1970, with isolation rising from .23 to .66 between 1900 and 1970. However, 63 percent of the
overall increase had occurred by 1930. Dissimilarity peaked in 1950, with 97 percent of the 1900 to 1950 increase
(from .64 in 1900 to .81 in 1950) occurring between 1900 and 1930.
9
A detailed description of the construction of this data can be found in Shertzer, Walsh, and Logan (2016).

9

(Manhattan and Brooklyn boroughs), Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and St. Louis from the genealogy
website Ancestry.com. To maximize the usefulness of the dataset for our purpose, we selected
northern cities that received substantial inflows of black in-migration. This sample contains the
ten largest northern cities in the United States in 1880 and nine out of the ten largest cities in the
United States in 1930. The combined population of these cities was 9.3 million in 1900 and over
18 million in 1930, which is about half of the total population in the largest 100 cities in both
years.
The microdata compiled for this paper represent a significant improvement over existing
sources of data on early twentieth century urban populations. Ward-level tabulations published
by the census are the smallest unit at which 100 percent counts were previously available for the
combination of cities and years that we study. Wards, which are still in use in some cities today,
are large political units used to elect city council members while enumeration districts were
small administrative units used internally by the census to coordinate enumeration activities prior
to the shift to mail surveys in 1960. Each individual record in the Ancestry.com dataset includes
place of birth, father’s place of birth, mother’s place of birth, year of birth, marital status, gender,
race, year of immigration (for foreign-born individuals), and relation to head of household in
addition to place of residence (city, ward, and enumeration district) at the time of the respective
census.
To place these individuals in urban space, we create digitized versions of census
enumeration district maps based on two types of information available from the National
Archives. We first employ written descriptions of the enumeration districts that are available on
microfilm from the National Archives and have been made available online due to the work of

10

Stephen P. Morse. 10 Second, we utilize a near complete set of physical enumeration district
maps for our census-city pairs in the maps section of the National Archives. We took digital
photographs of these maps as a second source for our digitization effort. Working primarily with
geocoded (GIS) historic base street maps that were developed by the Center for Population
Economics (CPE) at the University of Chicago, research assistants generated GIS representations
of the enumeration district maps that are consistent with the historic street grids. 11 Appendix
Figure I provides an illustration of this process which generated maps of more than 35,000
distinct enumeration districts. Here the shaded regions in panel D represent the digitized
enumeration districts.
Analyzing demographic change over time within neighborhoods requires neighborhood
definitions that are constant across census years. Using these data to form such neighborhoods is
challenging because enumeration districts were redrawn for each decadal census and, unlike the
case of modern-day census tracts, most changes were more complex than simple combinations or
bifurcations. To address this challenge, we employ a hexagon-based imputation strategy. The
strategy is illustrated in Appendix Figure II. It involves covering the enumeration district maps
(Panel A) with an evenly spaced temporally invariant grid of 800 meter hexagons (Panel B) and
then computing the intersection of these two sets of polygons (Panel C). Hexagons were chosen
because they are the most compact way to tile the plane with symmetric shapes. The chosen size
yields average populations that are comparable to those of census tracts. 12 The count data from
the underlying enumeration districts is attached to individual hexagons based on the percentage

These street files can now be found at the Union Army Project’s website (www.uadata.org). We used 1940 street
maps produced by John Logan at the Spatial Structures in the Social Sciences at Brown University for Detroit,
Cleveland, and St. Louis.

Appendix Figure VI provides a visual comparison between our 800-meter hexagons and 1940 census tracts. As
we discuss below, our results are not sensitive to the choice of hexagon size.

of the enumeration district’s area that lies within the individual hexagon. Panel D presents the
allocation weights for a sample hexagon. In the example, 100 percent of four enumeration
districts lies completely within the hexagon (136, 139, 140, and 144) while 11 enumeration
districts are partially covered by the hexagon. For these partial enumeration districts, only
fractions of their counts are attributed to the hexagon, ranging from a minimum of 0.2 percent
(155) to 93.6 percent (142).
We form a balanced panel comprised of all hexagons that were at least 95 percent
covered by enumeration districts from the respective census in each year from 1900 to 1930, also
trimming at the 1st and 99th percentile of both white and black population change for each decade
to eliminate outliers from the sample. In Table 1 we provide summary statistics for the balanced
sample of 1,975 hexagon neighborhoods. The neighborhoods have an average population of
3,160 individuals in 1910 and 4,216 in 1930, with the increase in density reflecting the rise in
urban population density that occurred over this period. By 1930 the neighborhoods are thus
roughly similar in population to modern-day census tracts. The average white population growth
is positive in all years but declined from 650 over the 1900s to 282 over the 1920s, with much of
this slowdown due to declining immigration from Europe after World War I and passage of the
Immigration Restriction Act of 1921. The average percent black increased from 2.2 to 4.5
percent over the 1900 to 1930 period.
IV.

Empirical Strategy
The objective of our empirical work is to ascertain whether black arrivals had a causal

impact on white population dynamics over the 1900 to 1930 period. The primary difficulty in
identifying such an effect is that minorities do not arrive in neighborhoods exogenously. For
example, newly arriving blacks may choose locations that were already being abandoned by
12

white natives for reasons unrelated to race, leading to upwardly biased estimates of white flight
responses in a naïve estimation framework. Conversely, blacks and whites could both be drawn
to neighborhoods whose populations are growing due to other factors unrelated to race, leading
to a downward bias in flight response estimates. To address this concern, we utilize an
instrumental variables approach which leverages exogenous sources of variation in black
population size at the neighborhood level. 13
Our main estimation strategy addresses the causality of white flight by directly utilizing
exogenous variation in neighborhood racial composition that arose as the result of heterogeneous
state-level black outmigration shocks. Our analysis is in the spirit of the immigration shock
literature (Altonji and Card, 1991; Boustan, Fishback, and Kantor, 2010; Saiz and Wachter,
2011; Cascio and Lewis, 2012).
We begin this analysis by considering a simple OLS model relating the decadal change in
black populations to the change in white populations:
𝑡𝑡1−𝑡𝑡0
Δ𝑊𝑊𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡1−𝑡𝑡0 = 𝛽𝛽Δ𝐵𝐵𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖
+ 𝜂𝜂𝑗𝑗 + 𝜖𝜖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 .

(1)

𝑡𝑡1−𝑡𝑡0
where Δ𝑊𝑊𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡1−𝑡𝑡0 (Δ𝐵𝐵𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖
) is the change in the number of whites (blacks) in a neighborhood over

a decade and 𝜂𝜂𝑗𝑗 is a city fixed effect. The coefficient of interest from this first differences

strategy, β, relates the change in the number of blacks to the change in the number of whites in a
particular neighborhood over the same decade with the city-level average captured by the fixed
effect. 14
In recent work there has been a growing concern that inappropriate model specification
can lead to biased estimates in models of native displacement (Peri and Sparber, 2011; Wright et

13

Our approach is similar to Boustan (2010) except we assign black inflows to neighborhoods instead of cities.
Note that because our neighborhoods (hexagons) are all of identical size, changes in population are equivalent to
changes in population density.
14

13

al., 1997; Wozniak and Murray, 2012). We implement a change-in-levels specification because it
facilitates the implementation of our counterfactual analysis and provides the most parsimonious
implementation for our IV strategy. This approach also does well in Peri and Sparber’s Monte
Carlo simulations of specification bias in displacement models and makes our results more
directly comparable to work in the post-war period by Boustan (2010). 15
While informative about general patterns in the data, due to a host of endogenity
concerns, it would be inappropriate to draw causal inferences from estimates associated with
equation (1). The following cases highlight a number of the potential sources of bias. First,
consider the case where neighborhood choice is solely driven by unobserved neighborhood
characteristics and is completely independent of race. If neighborhood-level housing supply is
perfectly inelastic then any randomly driven increase (decrease) in a neighborhood’s black
population must be offset one for one with a decrease (increase) in its white population. Thus, a
highly inelastic housing supply will bias estimates downward towards -1 in cases where the
actual causal relationship implies a value of β equal to 0.
Conversely, if the supply of housing is perfectly elastic and whites and blacks are subject
to the same neighborhood-specific demand shocks, on average blacks and whites would sort into
neighborhoods at the same relative rates and we would expect β > 0. The exact relationship will
be driven both by within city relocations and in-migration. If all population changes are driven
by in-migrants, β will capture the relative increase in group populations. In our sample, for the

15

One potential remaining concern is that a levels-based model will implicitly place a higher weight on more
heavily populated neighborhoods. To mitigate this concern, we trim the sample at the 1st and 99th percentiles of
black and white population changes. We also trim at the 1st and 99th percentiles of black and white head of
household changes to facilitate the robustness check in Table 3. As a further robustness check, in Appendix Table I,
we demonstrate that our results are robust to stratification of the sample by population quartile. We also modified
our specification to more closely match what Peri and Sparber recommend in the immigration context, in particular
scaling both the change in blacks and change in whites by city population at the start of the decade. Our results are
largely unchanged (available upon request).

14

1920 to 1930 decade, this would imply an upwardly biased estimate of β that would be
approximately equal to 2 when the true causal relationship implies β equal to 0. Finally, if supply
is elastic and the neighborhood level demand shocks experienced by blacks and whites are
negatively correlated, for instance due to low-income blacks being differentially attracted to low
price neighborhoods that are being systematically vacated by higher income whites, then the
OLS estimates will be biased downward.
Supply elasticity estimates are not available for our sample neighborhoods. However, the
magnitude of population growth in our fixed-border neighborhoods (in terms of both individuals
and households) suggests that housing supply was quite elastic at both the core and the periphery
during this period. As a result, we do not generally expect negative coefficients to arise purely as
a result of supply inelasticity. Regardless, the above discussion highlights the likely problem of
bias in these simple OLS regressions. Shared sorting on neighborhood characteristics will impart
upward bias to OLS estimates of β (away from flight). While OLS estimates of β will be biased
in a negative direction (towards flight) if black arrivals were settling in neighborhoods already
being abandoned by whites either due to inelastic supply or negatively correlated tastes for other
unobserved neighborhood characteristics.
To overcome this bias concern, we leverage exogenous variation in contemporary statelevel black outmigration rates in combination with pre-1900 patterns of black settlement in our
𝑡𝑡1−𝑡𝑡0
sample of northern cities. Particularly, we construct an instrument for Δ𝐵𝐵𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖
using the universe

of historical census records, digitized versions of which were recently made available by

Ancestry.com, to estimate black outflows from each state in each decade (1900 through 1930)

15

and settlement patterns established by African Americans who came to the North before the
Great Migration and were thus living in our sample cities by 1900. 16
To estimate the total number of black out-migrants from each state over each census
decade, we exploit the 100 percent census microdata samples for 1900 through 1930 and count,
for each state, the number of black individuals who appear outside of their state of birth in each
gender, state of birth, and birth cohort cell. For simplicity, we consider only individuals under
the age of 60 and aggregate birth cohorts into ten year intervals. To illustrate, for the census year
1900, we count the number of individuals of each gender observed outside each birth state in the
1840-1849, 1850-1859, 1860-1869, 1870-1879, 1880-1889, and 1890-1899 birth cohorts. The
total number of out-migrants in each cell is obtained by summing over the number of outmigrants present in each state of residence. To obtain the estimated outflow at the national level
by cell over a census decade, we take the difference in the number of out-migrants by the five
birth cohort intervals (c), two genders (g), and 51 states of birth (s) appearing in each state:

For the 1900 base year component of the instrument, we count the number of black outmigrants in each birth cohort-gender-state of birth cell present in each neighborhood of our

We note that the black populations in northern cities in 1880, the next earliest year for which microdata samples
are available, are generally too small to have statistical power in predicting where future black arrivals would settle.

Our approach departs from much of the literature on the impact of immigration on local

labor markets, where previous papers measure actual inflow rates across origin sources. Because
there are no systematic data on internal migration flows in the United States prior to 1940, we
need to instead work with estimated outflows which are inferred from data on state of birth and
state of residence. However, we are able to observe a rich set of characteristics of black migrants
living outside their birth state, in particular year of birth and gender, enabling a close
approximation to the true size of outflows in each decade. These two approaches are thus in
principal very similar. Following other papers in this literature, our instrument relies on the fact
that blacks departing their states of birth (primarily in the South) tended to follow a settlement
distribution pattern that was similar to that of blacks who had left their state in earlier decades,
due to the stability of railway routes and enduring social networks. 18 We are able to utilize
additional aspects of the chain migration process than has generally been possible in previous
work. In particular, we exploit the fact that migrants tended to cluster near previous arrivals from
the same state of origin, generating plausibly exogenous variation in black populations at the
neighborhood level. Furthermore, because of the source state variation, we can control for
baseline neighborhood-level black population in our analysis.

17
We shift the cohorts for each decade so that individuals of the same age are assigned in the same proportion across
time. For instance, outflows of men from Alabama who were born in the 1900-1909 decade and were thus between
the ages of 21 and 30 in 1930 were assigned to neighborhoods according to the distribution of men born in Alabama
aged 21 to 30 present in 1900.
18
See Grossman (1989, pp. 66-119) for a discussion of the importance of rail routes for black migration to the
North.

17

For our instrument to have power, two types of variation are needed. First, within a given
city the distribution of blacks across neighborhoods must differ by state of origin. To illustrate
the presence of variation in this dimension, Appendix Figure III provides city-level scatter plots
showing by neighborhood the share of black men aged 20 to 29 in 1900 who were born in two
exemplar pairs of sending states. Panel A shows that for instance neighborhoods within Boston,
Brooklyn, Chicago, Cleveland, and Philadelphia all exhibit rich variation in the share of black
men from this cohort originating in North Carolina as opposed to Virginia. Panel B shows the
significant variation across neighborhoods in Chicago, Cincinnati, and St. Louis in the share of
the black population originating in Kentucky versus Tennessee.
In addition to differential within city sorting, we also require that variation exists across
sending states over time. Appendix Figure IV shows the estimated outflows from the thirteen
most important sending states for black men aged 20 to 29 across each of the decades we study
in this paper. 19 Texas and Virginia provided relatively more out-migrants during the 1900 to
1910 decade while South Carolina and Georgia were the most significant sending states by the
1920 to 1930 decade. Taken together, Appendix Figures III and IV suggest the potential
predictive power of our instrument. The instrument is further strengthened by the fact that we
compute its components separately by birth cohort and gender. 20 Formal F-tests presented
below confirm this suggestive evidence regarding the instrument’s power.

Analysis of White Flight in the Early Twentieth Century

19

These thirteen states represent between 87 and 92 percent of total black outflows in the years we study.
We construct our baseline instrument using state of birth, gender, and birth cohort cells to reflect the fact that
black migration to northern cities was largely based on employment, and information on jobs in particular
neighborhoods would likely have been tailored to individuals of a similar age and gender. However, we show our
results are largely unchanged when using a simplified instrument that uses only state of birth and gender, reflecting a
more general chain migration process, in Table 3. Our results are also similar if we use only state of birth to
construct the instrument (available upon request).
20

18

To estimate the impact of black arrivals on white population dynamics, we begin with
OLS estimation of equation (1). Results from this analysis are presented in Table 2. Here we
follow the literature and consider changes in population numbers while controlling for the
average change in white population with city fixed effects. 21 Between 1900 and 1910 we find
that one black arrival has no statistically significant effect on white population dynamics. By the
second decade (1910-1920), one black arrival is associated with a statistically significant .9
decline in the number of whites. This estimated relationship increases in precision and magnitude
by our sample’s final decade (1920-1930), with one black arrival now associated with the loss of
1.5 whites. The variation underlying the regressions for the latter two decades is shown in the
scatterplots in Figure 3. A linear trend line through the plot of black and white population
difference indicates that negative relationship is not driven by outliers and becomes larger in
magnitude between the 1910s and 1920s. We investigate the potential for nonlinear flight effects
in Section VI.
Given the concerns about endogenity raised in the previous section, it would be
inappropriate to directly interpret the OLS results for the later decades as evidence of flight
behavior. However, they are suggestive, and the final decade coefficient estimate is of a
magnitude that exceeds that which could be explained solely through the assumption of a
perfectly inelastic neighborhood-level housing supply. To further consider these issues, we turn
to the instrumental variables results also presented in Table 2. The IV estimate is -.9 and
insignificant in the 1900s but grows to -1.9 in the 1910s before reaching -3.4 in the 1920s. The
latter two coefficient estimates are both highly significant and in all three cases F-tests

21

As discussed in Section III, we drop the 1st and 99th percentiles of both black and white population changes to
ensure that our results are not being driven by outliers in the data.

19

demonstrate an extremely robust first stage. 22 Taken together, the OLS and IV estimates suggest
that whites were leaving neighborhoods in response to growing black arrivals, but that this effect
is masked in the OLS regressions, likely due to positive correlation between neighborhood-level
demand shocks experienced by both blacks and whites. This result stands in contrast to that of
Boustan (2010), who finds OLS coefficients that are negative in all years (1940-1970) and
generally similar in magnitude to IV results from an estimation strategy similar to ours when
measuring flight from the center city to the suburbs.
One potential concern with our approach is that spatial dependency across neighborhoods
may cause our standard errors to be understated. Table 2 also presents standard errors computed
using the GMM methodology proposed by Conley (1999) for addressing spatial clustering. The
average ratio of the Conley standard error to the baseline IV standard error (estimated using
LIML) is 1.57, indicating that spatial standard errors are roughly 60 percent larger than those
estimated under the assumption of spatial independence. To further investigate the extent of
spatial correlation in our data, we also run our specification on spatially independent subsamples,
each comprising 25 percent of the overall sample. Appendix Figure V presents a visualization of
a subsample for Pittsburgh. 23 In Table 2 we report the results from 100 bootstraps of 25 percent
spatially independent subsamples. Our coefficient estimates are essentially unchanged and, while
the smaller sample size is associated with higher standard errors, they remain highly significant
for the latter two decades. It is also interesting to note that if we adjust for the impact of the

22

Given the strength of our instrument, one may be concerned that our instrument is so correlated with the
endogenous variable that there is no scope for the IV approach to shed unwanted endogeneity from the estimation.
Exploratory analysis suggests that such overfitting is not a concern. For example, the correlation between our
instrument and endogenous variable in 1930 is .234 and the R-squared from a regression of the endogenous variable
on the instrument is only .116.
23
These subsamples are constructed one city at a time by a simple select and reject algorithm. The algorithm
randomly selects a candidate neighborhood for the subsample and tests for adjacency with the current elements of
the subsample. If the candidate neighborhood is adjacent to a current subsample member it is dropped. Otherwise it
is added to the sample. This process is repeated until a 25 percent subsample has been obtained.

20

bootstrap sample size on standard error magnitude, both the Conley approach and the spatially
independent subset approach suggest roughly the same level of attenuation in the uncorrected
standard errors due to spatial dependence. Given this finding, except where noted, in the
remaining analysis we report Conley standard errors. 24
A second potential concern is the validity of our IV approach. The exogeneity of our
instrument hinges on two critical assumptions. First, state-level black outmigration rates must not
be influenced by differences in within-city cross-neighborhood pull factors that are
systematically related to the origin state of early black settlers. Consider for example the fact that
during the 1920s, more blacks left Virginia than Texas. It cannot be the case that this state-level
differential in out-migrants arose (at least partially) because during the 1920s levels of economic
opportunity were higher in Chicago neighborhoods that received large numbers of Virginian
blacks before 1900 than in Chicago neighborhoods that received large numbers of Texan blacks.
Second, because by construction our instrument will predict higher black population growth in
neighborhoods that had relatively higher numbers of black residents in 1900, we need to
generally assume that there are no systematic differences between these neighborhoods and low
or no black neighborhoods that could potentially have a persistent confounding impact on
migration patterns.
While we believe the first assumption to be quite defendable, the second is a potential
concern. In 1900, even in those neighborhoods where they were most concentrated, blacks were
generally a substantial minority. However, these neighborhoods were typically located in the

24

As noted above, an additional concern with our basic approach is the potential for a small number of very large
population communities to drive our coefficient estimates. This concern motivates our decision to trim the sample at
the 1st and 99th percentile of population. However, as a further robustness check we reran our analysis on subsets of
our sample associated with the lowest quartile, highest quartile, and interquartile range of population. These results
(presented in Appendix Table I) show no qualitative difference between results in the three subsamples and our
results for the entire sample. The largest point estimate occurs on the interquartile subsample for the 1920 to 1930
decade, allaying concerns about our results being driven by a few highly populated neighborhoods.

21

urban core and hence may differ systematically in other potentially important dimensions.
Fortunately, this concern is quite straight forward to address by controlling for the size of each
neighborhood’s 1900 black population in our IV analysis. In doing so we essentially guarantee
that we are identifying the flight effect based solely on variation in the pre-1900 source state
composition of these neighborhoods’ black populations, independent of the overall size of their
black populations.
This concern is the first issue we address in Table 3 which presents a number of
robustness checks. We control for percent black in 1900 in the first set of checks and show our
results are essentially unchanged (slightly larger in magnitude). We also control for the number
of blacks in 1900 in the next robustness check, but we cannot do this exercise for the 1900 to
1910 decade because number of blacks in 1900 is used to compute change in black population.
The results are reduced in magnitude somewhat but are still sizeable and significant.
As a further robustness test, we also show our results with the inclusion of pre-trends in
white population in addition to percent black in 1900. Although the pre-trend may absorb some
of the true effect of white flight from black arrivals carrying over from the previous decade, our
results for both the 1910 to 1920 and 1920 to 1930 decade are still significant and similar in
magnitude to the baseline. 25 We also present results from an alternate definition of our
instrument where only southern states are used to compute black outflows (instead of all fifty
states as in our original instrument). Our results are again similar to the baseline suggesting that,
as expected, migration shocks out of the South are driving our instrument. The estimates of the
flight effect are also quantitatively similar if we drop birth cohort or both birth cohort and gender

25

As an additional test along these lines, in Appendix Table III we evaluate how well this decade’s black inflows
predict last decade’s change in white population. Coefficient estimates are much too small in magnitude to be
driving our results.

22

from the instrumental variable calculation, approaches that reflect a more general chain
migration approach.
Finally, one might be concerned that black households are smaller on average than white
households, leading to an exaggerated appearance of “flight” when a white family is replaced by
a black family. Using the relationship to the head of household variable, we created an alternate
dataset using only heads of household in the census and replicated our analysis at the household
level. 26 The results from the 1920s indicate that the arrival of one black household led to the
departure of 3.5 white households, strongly suggesting that differences in household composition
are not driving our findings. We also show in Appendix Table II that the results are generally
similar when the estimation is run on each city and decade separately. 27
The white population in our sample cities was split relatively evenly between firstgeneration immigrants, second-generation immigrants, and third-or-more-generation whites (see
Table 1). A natural question to ask about these results concerns the subgroups engaged in white
flight. Table 4 reports the results of the white flight IV regressions by white subgroup. Between
.7 and 1.6 white natives left their neighborhood in response to each black arrival in all decades.
The acceleration of the overall white flight affect appears to be driven in part by the emergence
of such behavior by first and second-generation immigrants. While there is no evidence of causal

26

The head of household dataset contains some significant outliers due to a fraction of a black head of household
being assigned to a neighborhood, leading to very large ratios of blacks to black heads of household in areas with
very few blacks. Outliers also arise for white household heads due to large institution containing many whites but no
household heads. We trim at the 99th percentile of the ratio of white to white household heads as well as black to
black household heads to remove these outliers in both the head of household dataset and the main dataset.
27
An exception is Cleveland over the 1920-1930 decade. The instrument works poorly for this city-decade pair
because the black population was tiny in 1900 and located in a different part of the city from where the ghetto
emerged in the 1920s (near the Central Avenue District).

23

departures in the 1900s, by the 1920s the coefficient is close to -1 for both groups, suggesting
that immigrants account for more of the flight effect over time. 28
Another potential source of flight is that of northern-born blacks away from black
migrants from the South. The existing historical work emphasizes that even higher-class urban
blacks were largely confined to the ghetto; however, the most economically successful blacks
may have moved out to the periphery of the ghetto when new migrants arrived (Massey and
Denton, 1991, pp 33-38). Appendix Table IV reports the results of a regression that relates
changes in southern black population to changes in northern black population. Both the OLS and
IV effects are positive although the estimated causal effect declines from .8 to .05 across the
decades we study. These results suggest that, at least at the neighborhood level, northern blacks
were attracted to the same neighborhoods chosen by southern blacks although this preference
attenuated over time. We find no evidence that northern blacks exhibited the same type of flight
behavior as did white immigrants during this period.
Finally, a possible concern is that our results are driven by the choice of 800 meter
hexagons as a neighborhood definition. Appendix Table V replicates our main analysis using
instead 400 meter and 1600 meter hexagons as neighborhood definitions and demonstrates that
our results are robust to choice of hexagon size. The table also presents results using instead
1940 census tract boundaries as neighborhood definitions. While generally consistent with our
main findings, this approach leads to larger estimated levels of flight, with the most marked
difference occurring in the first decade of our sample. One possible explanation is that census
boundaries yield neighborhood definitions that are more salient than arbitrarily located hexagons

28

The coefficient on change in first-generation immigrant population change is actually positive and significant in
the first decade. This result could be driven by recent European immigrants being drawn to the businesses and
institutions that catered to the needs of recently arrived families regardless of origin and that may have been more
likely to develop in neighborhoods that experienced high rates of black in-migration.

24

in terms of white perceptions of black in-migration. Conversely, there is concern about the large
heterogeneity in census tract size. The 10th and 90th percentile tracts differ in size by more than a
factor of 10 (see Appendix Figure VI for a visualization of 800 meter hexagons and 1940 census
tracts). This concern is somewhat ameliorated in the last decade of our sample when tracts sizes
are closely related to population density. Here using census tracts yields a flight estimate 17
percent higher than that found when using 800 meter hexagons. However, in the early decades,
the link between density and tract size is much weaker. Thus, we believe our current approach to
be the most conservative.
VI.

How Important was Flight for the Rise of Segregation in U.S. Cities?
In this section we use our preferred causal estimates of white flight to construct a series

of counterfactuals aimed at understanding how much of the observed increase in segregation
over the 1900 to 1930 period can be attributed to sorting as opposed to discriminatory
institutions. We begin with a simple exercise focusing on the 1920 to 1930 decade to
demonstrate the link between our coefficient estimates and the underlying population dynamics
for whites and blacks. Next, we employ a range of assumptions on the sorting behavior of newly
arrived black residents in each city – representing the extent of institutional barriers constraining
where black families could live – and then apply our estimates to predict neighborhood-level
white population changes associated with the resulting distribution of black in-migrants. This
counterfactual exercise allows us to roughly decompose the relative contribution of white flight
and housing market discrimination on the growth in segregation in each decade.
A. An Illustration for the 1920 to 1930 Decade
We begin with a simple exercise in Table 5 to demonstrate the link between our
coefficient estimates from the instrumental variables analysis and underlying population

25

dynamics. Focusing on the 1920 to 1930 decade, we use the complete set of coefficient estimates
(i.e. including the full set of city fixed effects) to predict each neighborhood’s change in white
population as a function of its 1900 black share and its observed change in black population
between 1920 and 1930. 29 These neighborhood level predictions are aggregated to yield a
sample-wide average.
The results for the full sample are presented in the first column of Table 5. The mean
white population in 1920 across the sample is 3663 and the mean black population is 133. The
predicted average change in neighborhood white population based on our simple prediction
exercise is 283 individuals. This result illustrates the fact that while neighborhoods with larger
numbers of black in-migrants were losing whites relative to those with few black in-migrants, on
average, white populations were increasing. This relationship is captured in the city-level fixed
effects. We note that we are generally seeing larger numbers of black in-migrants into
neighborhoods with larger black populations. However, our baseline results do not necessarily
require that the causal relationship between the number of black in-migrants and the number of
white out-migrants differ across neighborhoods with differing black shares.
In particular, we may expect the relationship between black inflows and white outflows
to be nonlinear in light of the literature on neighborhood “tipping” (e.g. Grodzins, 1975;
Schelling, 1971; Card, Mas, and Rothstein, 2008). We proceed with a simple nonparametric
approach in the remaining columns of Table 5, partitioning the sample by 1920 black share and
rerunning our specification for neighborhoods with 0 to 5 percent black share, 5 to 10 percent
black share, 10 to 20 percent black share, and over 20 percent black share. Although the

29

We use the estimates presented in the second row of Table 3 that include controls for the percent black in 1900 as
we believe this to be our most robust specification. The standard errors presented in Table 5 are from the baseline IV
specification that assumes spatial independence because of the difficulty of obtaining spatial standard errors for the
smallest subsamples.

26

estimated white flight coefficient declines as 1920 black share increases, the implied average
change in white population is only positive (438) for the 0 to 5 percent black neighborhoods.
Neighborhoods in the 5 to 10 percent black range are predicted to lose on average 13 percent of
their white population. For the two largest share black subsamples, our model predicts even
larger white population losses. In particular, the -2.2 white flight coefficient for the over 20
percent black share subsample implies a loss of 37 percent of a neighborhood’s white population.
Thus, although we observe evidence of white flight across the black share distribution, white
outflows are relatively greatest in neighborhoods with the proportionally largest black population
at the start of the decade. These findings are generally consistent with the tipping literature.
B. Assessing the Relative importance of Institutional Barriers and White Departures
Finally, we leverage our empirical results to estimate the relative importance of white
flight, as opposed to institutional barriers on the locational choices of black households, in
explaining the observed rise in segregation over our study period. We focus exclusively on the
dissimilarity measure of segregation because, unlike isolation measures, dissimilarity measures
are not sensitive to proportional changes in relative population sizes. Furthermore, nearly all of
the increase in dissimilarity in large cities occurred by 1930 (see Figure 1).
To identify the relative importance of white flight compared with institutional constraints
on where blacks could live, we must first identify a counterfactual baseline estimate of what
segregation levels would have been if new black migrants had sorted based solely on their own
preferences. In this counterfactual world, black arrivals from the South could have sorted into
neighborhoods without facing institutional barriers or triggering white flight. Because of the
inherent difficulty of this exercise, we produce three sets of counterfactual estimates that we
believe span the range of possible outcomes.

27

We next compare dissimilarity measures under these “no institutions/no flight”
counterfactuals to a set of “institutions/no flight” counterfactuals that hold white location choices
fixed and allocate new black entrants based on the pre-existing black location choices. This
comparison allows us to estimate the impact of institutions on segregation. 30 Next, using our
empirical estimates of flight behavior to adjust the location choices of whites in the
“institutions/no flight” counterfactual to reflect the role of white location decisions, we can
measure the increase in segregation when both the barriers and flight mechanisms are in place
(“institutions/flight”). Finally, we compare the “institutions/flight” outcomes from our
constructed counterfactual to the actual observed level of segregation. The residual from this
comparison demonstrates how well our model predicts observed levels of segregation.
The most challenging part of this process is identifying the “no institutions/no flight”
baseline. Our first approach is to allocate the net increase in each city’s black population in a
pattern consistent with the distribution of a European immigrant group that did not experience
intense discrimination in the housing market. We choose Italians as our benchmark because this
ethnic group was roughly similar in size to the black population and arrived in northern cities at
approximately the same time. 31
We consider two possible benchmark years, 1910 and 1930. Several factors lead us to
conclude that 1910 likely provides an upper bound on the level of black segregation that would

30

Another option for computing the “institutions/no flight” counterfactuals is to allocate the decadal inflow of
blacks based on their actual location choices. The results presented below in Table 6 are essentially unchanged if we
use this method instead of what is presented.
31
To visualize the relative concentrations of blacks and Italian immigrants across these two target periods, Appendix
Figure VII presents the distribution of both groups in Brooklyn (Panels A and B) and Cleveland (Panels C and D) in
both 1910 and 1930. Neighborhoods are ordered according to their share of the city’s respective minority
population. These two cities are generally representative of the patterns we observe across the sample. In Brooklyn,
Italians and blacks had similar distributions in 1910, but by 1930 blacks were more concentrated and Italians less so.
In Cleveland, there were two black and two Italian enclave neighborhoods in 1910 that contained between 15 and 40
percent of the respective minority population. By 1930, both minorities had expanded beyond these enclaves, but
blacks were still more concentrated than Italians.

28

have arisen based solely on the preferences of black immigrants. The decade preceding 1910
represented the peak decade of Italian immigration into the United States. Unlike black
immigrants from the southern United States, recent Italian immigrants faced significant language
barriers and thus had heightened incentives to locate in enclaves of native Italian speakers.
Furthermore, while there is no evidence that Italian immigrants experienced housing
discrimination at the level experienced by blacks, there is a large historical record suggesting that
Italians experienced significant animus and ethnic prejudice during this era of mass
immigration. 32 Thus, the level of Italian immigrant segregation observed in 1910 likely was
above that which would have occurred based solely on the preferences of Italian immigrants.
With the rise of hostilities in Europe in 1914, the flow of Italian immigrants dropped by
nearly an order of magnitude. 33 The National Immigration Acts of 1921 and 1924 served to
make this reduction in immigrant flow permanent. Thus, by 1930, the vast majority of Italian
immigrants in the United States had had more than a decade to assimilate, likely weakening the
language-driven motivation for enclave formation. In addition, with the end of large-scale Italian
immigration, the anti-immigrant imperative for anti-Italian prejudice was greatly attenuated and
we can find no documented evidence of discrimination against Italians in housing markets by
this point. As a result, the ethnic sorting of Italians in 1930 may provide a better benchmark for
our “no institutions/no flight” counterfactual. 34

32

As an example, in their 1947 evaluation of racial covenants on properties in St. Louis and Chicago, Long and
Johnson present no evidence that Italian heritage was ever included as a condition for denying the transfer of a deed.
For a detailed overview of anti-Italian animus, see Wop!: A Documentary History of Anti-Italian Discrimination in
the United States by Salvatore John LaGumina.
33
During the five year period from 1910 to 1914, 1.1 million Italians immigrated to the United States. Over the
following five years (1915-1919), only around 125,000 Italians immigrated to the United States. Source: U.S.
Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, A Statistical Abstract Supplement, Historical Statistics of the
United States from Colonial Times to 1957, pp. 56-57.
34
We considered using other immigrant groups as a robustness check. Germans and Irish had been immigrating to
the U.S. since the 1840s and had much larger groups in northern cities by the 1900s relative to blacks.
Inconsistencies with how the census recorded individuals born in Bohemia and Poland preclude the use of these

29

Thus, sorting like Italians in 1910 likely provides a reasonable upper bound for a “no
institutions/no flight” black segregation counterfactual while an approach based on the groups
distribution in 1930 may provide a more appropriate approximation to a true “no institutions/no
flight” counterfactual. Finally, our third “no institutions/no flight” counterfactual provides a
lower bound by considering the segregation that would have occurred if all recent (over the
previous ten years) black in-migrants sorted into neighborhoods in a way that reflected the preexisting distribution of the entire population, making no distinction by race or ethnicity. Further
details on how the counterfactuals were constructed can be found in the appendix. 35
We present a summary of the dissimilarity results obtained from our counterfactual
exercise in Table 6. Panel A presents counterfactual estimates of dissimilarity under each of our
constructed scenarios. Actual dissimilarity increased from .532 to .666 between 1910 and 1930
in the sample, with the largest increase occurring over the 1920s. Our preferred approach to
estimating the “no institutions/no flight” baseline for segregation is presented in the first column
of Panel A (assigning black inflows to match Italian settlement in 1930). Comparing the three
“no institutions/no flight” counterfactuals to the “institutions/no flight” counterfactual allows us
to estimate the contribution of institutions that constrained where blacks could live to the growth
in segregation over each decade. These estimates are presented in the first three columns of Panel

groups. Finally, Russian immigrants were less dispersed than Italians and had only a minimal presence in several of
our sample cities.
35
We note that one potential concern is that by taking the previous decade’s level of segregation as fixed and then
building our counterfactuals based solely on the sorting of new in-migrants (and white responses to these new inmigration) we may have biased our baseline counterfactuals (“no institutions/no flight”) upward towards finding
higher levels of segregation. However, this concern is mitigated by the following three factors. First, these new
migrants make up a substantial portion of the overall black population (well over 50 percent over the critical 1920s).
Second, given the rapid rise in segregation observed over each decade in our sample, bias imparted by producing a
baseline distribution that incorporates the location decisions of blacks that were made in earlier decades will be
contaminated by much lower levels of institutional constraints. Lastly, to the extent that a bias survives these first
two points, it will be embedded in all three types of counterfactuals and should wash out in relative comparisons
between the role of flight and institutional barriers.

30

B. Comparing the “institutions/no flight” and “institutions/flight” counterfactuals allows us to
estimate the contribution of white flight (presented in the fourth column of Panel B).
Focusing on our preferred baseline, the most striking finding is the sharp increase in the
contribution of flight in each subsequent decade (presented in Panel C). While the counterfactual
results suggest that the flight effect was relatively small during the aughts, we estimate that flight
was responsible for 34 percent of the increase in segregation (as measured by dissimilarity) in
our model over the 1910s with institutions responsible for 66 percent of the total. 36 Over the
1920s, the decade of greatest increase in segregation, white flight was responsible for 50 percent
of the increase. The residual, presented in the fifth column of Panel B, represents the difference
between the observed level of segregation and our prediction. It is negligible for the 1930
decade. The residual is larger in the earlier two decades, particularly so in the 1910s, suggesting
the emergence of new forms of discrimination in the housing market such as bombings or
attempts at racial zoning ordinances that are not captured in our model. Institutions, on the other
hand, made declining relative contributions to segregation in our baseline counterfactual over the
1900 to 1930 period, ranging from 73 percent in the 1900s to 50 percent in the 1920s.
As discussed above, assigning black inflows to match Italian settlement in 1910 provides
a lower bound for the institutional effect and likely overstates the amount of segregation that
would have arisen solely as a consequence of black preferences. Accordingly the results under
this baseline, presented in the second column of Panel B, find that institutions played a very
small role. Under this assumption, white flight explains at least 75 percent of observed
segregation in each of the three decades. At the other extreme, assigning black inflows to match
the overall population distribution arguably provides an upper bound on the role of institutions.

36

The calculation for the role of flight over the 1910s is .026/(.026+.051) = .34. The calculation for the 1920s is
analogous.

31

However, even under this conservative approach where we essentially assume that blacks had no
true preference for living near one another, white flight still is predicted to account for 23 percent
of the rise in segregation during the 1920s (column 3 of Panel C).
The results from this counterfactual exercise demonstrate that decentralized sorting
behavior by whites had a quantitatively important and increasing impact on the rise of residential
segregation between 1900 and 1930. Our findings suggest that the transition from institutional
barriers to white flight as the driving force behind segregation in U.S. cities began several
decades earlier than previously thought. Although the Fair Housing Act and other legislative and
legal remedies have greatly reduced (without fully eliminating) the barriers faced by blacks in
the housing market, white flight from black neighbors is an individual behavior that cannot be
limited by local or federal government agencies. Thus, a key takeaway from this exercise is that
segregation could have emerged even in the absence of discriminatory barriers in the housing
market through the mechanism of population sorting.
VII.

Conclusion

This paper studies why racial segregation emerged in American cities, providing the first
empirical analysis of white flight and its role in the emergence of the black ghetto. Leveraging a
new dataset, our empirical analysis identifies the residential response of white individuals to the
initial influx of rural blacks into the industrial cities of the North on the eve of the First World
War. We ask to what extent white departures in response to black arrivals can account for the
rise of segregation in American cities. Because restrictive covenants and racial zoning
ordinances are no longer legal and racial violence and housing discrimination are less severe in
the present day, our analysis to some extent investigates whether segregation could have
emerged in the current institutional and legal environment.

32

Our analysis suggests that the dynamics of white populations likely played a key role in
the sharp increase in racial segregation observed over the 1900 to 1930 period. Our analysis
shows that black arrivals caused an increasing number of white departures in each decade: by
the 1920s, one black arrival was associated with the loss of more than three white individuals.
The robustness of these findings and the way in which they vary across time suggests that
changes in white animus were a key factor in rising racial segregation.
White flight was not simply a response to deplorable ghetto conditions developed over
decades of black migration to northern cities. Instead, whites appear to have been fleeing black
neighbors as soon as the migration from the South got underway, and these market decisions had
important impacts on the aggregate level of racial segregation in cities. These findings nuance
our understanding of the persistence of segregation in the United States, suggesting that even the
complete elimination of racial discrimination in housing markets may fail to bring about
significant racial integration so long as the sizeable numbers of white individuals remain willing
to move to avoid having black neighbors.
An important question raised by the findings of this paper is what led to the accelerated
white flight effect observed over the 1900 to 1930 period. Moving forward, understanding why
white Americans fled black neighbors at increasing rates and where they settled subsequently is
crucial to understanding why American cities became and remain sharply segregated by race.
Increased awareness of future black arrivals, the failure of racial zoning ordinances, impacts of
racial transition on housing prices, and improvements in urban transit infrastructure are all
potential explanations that warrant further investigation.

census records from Ancestry.com. Only hexagons with at least 95 percent coverage by enumeration districts from the respective census in each year are
included in the panel. We also trim the sample at the 1st and 99th percentile of both white and black population change for each decade. We also trim at the 99th
percentile of the ratio of white to white household heads and black to black household heads. The statistics presented cover the balanced panel of 1,975 hexagon

Notes: The “No Institution/No Flight” counterfactual simulates dissimilarity that would arise if blacks faced no constraints in the housing market and settled in a
pattern similar to the basis group (see appendix for details) and whites did not depart in response to their arrival. The “Institutions No Flight” counterfactual
assigns blacks to neighborhoods according to the existing black population distribution and again does not allow whites to depart in response to their arrival. The
“Institutions Flight” counterfactual assigns blacks to neighborhoods according to the existing black population distribution and allows whites to depart in
response. The “institution effect” in Panel B is the difference between the respective “no institutions/no flight” and “institutions/no flight” counterfactuals
presented in Panel A. The “flight effect” is the difference between the “institutions/no flight” and “institutions/flight” counterfactuals. The residual is the
difference between the “institutions/flight” counterfactual and the observed level of dissimilarity in the panel dataset. The flight share in Panel C is the share of
segregation in the model explained by flight as a share of segregation explained by either flight or institutions.

Notes: Changes in population are also with respect to the previous decade’s value. All demographic variables were
created using the 100 percent sample of census records from Ancestry.com. Only hexagons with at least 95 percent
coverage by enumeration districts from the respective census in each year are included in each panel. We also trim
the sample at the 1st and 99th percentile of both white and black population change for each decade. The statistics
presented cover the balanced panel of hexagon neighborhoods that remain after this trim. The instrumental variables
regressions are estimated using limited information maximum likelihood estimation (LIML).

58

Construction of the Segregation Counterfactuals
The details of our approach are as follows:
Step 1: Establish sample
We use the consistent panel of neighborhoods that appear in each decade from the primary
dataset. This balanced panel has 1,975 neighborhoods across the ten cities in our sample. We
use the actual 1900 neighborhood populations of both blacks and whites as fixed.
Step 2: Construct the black population distribution for the “no institutions” counterfactuals
We allocate observed city-level black population growth over the 1900 to 1910 decade to
neighborhoods according to match that of the three allocation rules to model the presence of
institutional barriers. These allocations are by Italians in 1930 (our baseline), by Italians in 1910
(our upper bound for preference-induced segregation), and by the total population (our lower
bound for preference-induced segregation. These allocations are added to the base year
populations for 1900. As an example, consider the case of the Italian 1930 counterfactual for
Brooklyn. 4.9% of all Italian immigrants living in Brooklyn in 1930 were in the single
neighborhood (hexagon) with the largest Italian population. Brooklyn received 5,502 new blacks
between 1900 and 1910, so we allocate 4.9% of them or 270 of these black individuals to the
neighborhood with highest 1900 total black population. Next we move to the neighborhood with
the second-highest total black population. In 1930, 3.9% of all Brooklyn Italians lived in the
neighborhood with the second-highest total population of Italians. So, we allocate 3.9% of the
new black arrivals to the neighborhood with the second-highest number of blacks in 1900. We
continue this process until all new black arrivals have been allocated and then repeat the process
for the nine other cities in our sample.
Step 3: Construct the black population distribution for the “institutions” counterfactuals
To model the presence of discriminatory institutions, for this counterfactual we allocate observed
city-level black population growth over the 1900 to 1910 decade to match black settlement at the
start of the decade. For instance, a neighborhood that had 5 percent of the city’s black
population in 1900 would be assigned 5 percent of black population growth over the 1900 to
1910 decade.
Step 4: Construct the white population distribution for the “no flight” counterfactuals
We compute a no-flight hypothetical white population for 1910 by assigning white population
growth over the 1900 to 1910 decade according to the overall population distribution. For
instance, a neighborhood that had 5 percent of the city’s population in 1900 would be assigned 5
percent of white population growth over the 1900 to 1910 decade.
Step 5: Construct the white population distribution for the “flight” counterfactual

59

We apply the baseline instrumented equation (2) estimates to generate the predicted white
population change over the 1900 to 1910 decade in each neighborhood. 37 This prediction takes
into account both city-level fixed effects and the coefficient on the change in black population.
Step 6: Compute the counterfactual dissimilarity indices
We use the respective “no institutions” hypothetical black population from Step 2 and “no flight”
hypothetical white population from Step 4 and compute the dissimilarity index to obtain the “no
institutions/no flight” counterfactuals reported in Table 7. Next, we use the respective
“institutions” hypothetical black population from Step 3 and “no flight” hypothetical white
population from Step 4 and compute the dissimilarity index to obtain the “institutions/no flight”
counterfactuals. Finally, we use the respective “institutions” hypothetical black population from
Step 3 and “flight” hypothetical white population from Step 5 and compute the dissimilarity
index to obtain the “institutions/flight” counterfactuals.
We proceed analogously for the 1910 to 1920 period and the 1920 to 1930 period to construct
the rest of the counterfactual segregation levels in Table 7.

37

We note that this approach allows the predicted white population to differ from the actual white population by
some residual. We experimented with ways to assign the residual so that the predicted and actual white populations
were the same, for instance by assigning the difference to neighborhoods proportionally according to their share of
the city’s population at the start of the respective decade. Our results were qualitatively unchanged. We ignore the
residual in our baseline approach because assigning the residual effectively redistributes white population into
neighborhoods with black residents, thus attenuating the increase in segregation that is generated in our
counterfactual.
