A Series of Unfortunate Events:¸˛Common Sequencing Patterns in Financial Crises

ABSTRACT
We document that the global scope and depth of the crisis the began with the collapse of the subprime
mortgage market in the summer of 2007 is unprecedented in the post World War II era and, as such,
the most relevant comparison benchmark is the Great Depression (or the Great Contraction, as dubbed
by Friedman and Schwartz, 1963) of the 1930s. Some of the similarities between these two global
episodes are examined but the analysis of the aftermath of severe financial crises is extended to also
include the most severe post-WWII crises as well. As to the causes of these great crises, we focus
on those factors that are common across time and geography. We discriminate between root causes
of the crises, recurring crises symptoms, and common features (such as misguided financial regulation
or inadequate supervision) which serve as amplifiers of the boom-bust cycle. There are recurring temporal
patterns in the boom-bust cycle and their broad sequencing is analyzed.

Introduction

“Overindebtedness simply means that debts are out-of-line, are too big relative to other
economic factors. It may be started by many causes, of which the most common
appears to be new opportunities to invest at a big prospective profit… such as through
new industries… Easy money is the great cause of over-borrowing.”
Irving Fisher (1933).
This paper follows my remarks at the XIth Angelo Costa Lecture, Rome, October
5, 2011 and draws heavily from Reinhart and Rogoff (2009) and Reinhart, Kirkeegard,
and Sbrancia (2011).
The issues I address fall into three broad areas or sections. 2 The next section
takes stock of the collateral damage, in terms of the incidence of banking crises and
currency and crashes around the world, which followed the financial turmoil that began as
the subprime crisis in the United States in the summer of 2007. Following a common
pattern in history, the financial crash has more recently morphed into full fledged
sovereign crises engulfing (to date), in varying degrees, Greece, Portugal, Ireland, Italy
and Spain. 3 Apart from its impact on domestic and international financial flows, not to
mention the changes in the landscape of the financial industry, that this crisis has
produced, the toll on the real economy has been great. The evolution of world trade helps
to illustrate the breadth and depth of the economic downturn. Global equity prices have
also followed a roller coaster pattern since the onset of crisis about four years ago. The
evidence presented here, places these developments in a broader historical and
international perspective that allows us to gauge the unusual severity of the unfolding
global crisis. Section III dwells on the aftermath of severe financial crises, and speculates

where we might be in the post-crisis cycle. The comparisons focus primarily on the
housing and labor markets, where the aftereffects of the crises have tended to linger the
longest. The fiscal implications and consequences of severe crises are discussed. Section
IV poses the question of what causes these great crises and what factors make them more
severe. The focus of this discussion is on causal factors that are common to severe
financial crises across countries and across time rather than those that are idiosyncratic to
the political and economic circumstances of the latest episode. The last section discusses
on the high (and rapidly rising) levels of public sector indebtedness in nearly all the
advanced economies and its implication for the “international financial architecture” in
the form of financial repression in years to come.

II. Taking stock: The global dimensions of the crisis
1. A global crisis index
So, where are we in a historical global context? We present an index which
proxies of world economic turbulence. These aggregate crisis indices are the time series
shown for 1900-2010 in Figure 1 for the “World”. The indices shown are weighted by a
country’s share in world GDP, as we have done for debt and banking crises. The 66country sample accounts for about 90 percent of world GDP. The country indices
(without stock market crashes) are compiled from the time of independence (if after
1800) onward; the index that includes the equity market crashes is calculated based on
data availability. While inflation and banking crises predate independence in many cases,
a sovereign debt crisis (external or internal) is by definition not possible for a colony. In
addition, numerous colonies did not always have their own currencies. The BCDI index

3

stands for banking (systemic episodes only), currency, debt (domestic and external), and
inflation crisis index. When stock market crashes are added (shown separately) to the
BCDI composite, we refer to it as the BCDI +
Figure 1 chronicles and summarizes the incidence, and to some degree the
severity of varied crisis experience. A cursory inspection of the figure reveals a very
different pattern for the pre- and post-WWII experience. The pre-war experience is
characterized by frequent and severe crises episodes ranging from the banking-crisis
driven “global” panic of 1907 to the debt and inflation crises associated with World War
II and its aftermath. The only period during the post war that we see as high an incidence
of crises is the fifties where, during World War II big countries -- Germany, Austria,
Japan, Italy -- were in a state of default and remained so through the early fifties. Plus, of
course, there were a lot of countries that had gone into default in the thirties that were still
in default. But since the immediate aftermath of World War II, we had not seen a crisis
this global in scope.
The sharp rise in the blue line (BCDI index) that we see in 2007 and more so in
2008 is mostly dominated by banking crises and also currency crashes. Indeed, a large
share of countries in the fall of 2008, had sufficiently large depreciations to classify as a
currency crash (i.e., exchange rate depreciations exceeding 15 percent). The red line
adds stock market crashes—which were ubiquitous in 2008-2009. No doubt, when the
index is updated to reflect year-end 2011 price levels, it will reveal yet another wave of
stock market crashes.

Notes: The banking, currency, default (domestic and external) and inflation composite (BCDI index) can
take a value between 0 and 5 (for any country in any given year) depending on the varieties of crises taking
place on a particular year. For instance, in 1998 the index took on a value of 5 for Russia, as there was a
currency crash, a banking and inflation crisis, and a sovereign default on both domestic and foreign debt
obligations. This index is then weighted by the country’s share in world income. This index is calculated
annually for the 66 countries in the sample for 1800-2010:6 (shown above for 1900-onwards). We have
added, for the borderline banking cases identified in Laeven and Valencia (2010) for the period 2007-2010.
In addition, we use the Barro and Ursua (2009) definition of a stock market crash for the 25 countries in
their sample (a subset of the 66-country sample-except for Switzerland) for the period 1864-2006; we
update their crash definition through June 2010, to compile our BCDI+ index. For the United States, for
example, the index posts a reading of 2 (banking crisis and stock market crash) in 2008; for Australia and
Mexico it also posts a reading of 2 (currency and stock market crash).

2. World trade
As to trade, we offer we offer an illustration of the evolution of trade during two
global crises. Figure 2 plots the value of World merchandise exports for 1928-2010. The
estimate for 2009 uses the actual year-end level for 2008 as the average for 2009; this
5

yields a 9 percent year-over-year decline in 2009, the largest one-year drop since 1938.

4

Other large post-WWII declines are in 1952, during the Korean War and in 1982-1983,
when recession hit the United States and a 1930s-scale debt crisis swept through the
emerging world. Smaller declines occurred in 1958, the bottom of a recession in the
United States, 1998 during the Asian financial crisis and in 2001, after September 11.

4

While we have reliable trade data for a most countries during World War II, there are sufficient missing
entries so as to make the calculation of the world aggregate not comparable to other years during 19401947.

Notes: The estimate for 2010 is from the World Economic Outlook. The 20.4 percent year-over-year
decline in 2010, is the largest post-war drop. Other large post-WWII declines are in 1952, during the
Korean War and in 1982-1983, when recession hit the United States and a 1930s-scale debt crisis swept
through the emerging world. Smaller declines occurred in 1958, the bottom of a recession in the United
States, 1998 during the Asian financial crisis and in 2001, after September 11.

3. The “big picture”
In sum, Figures 1-2 highlight the breadth, depth, and internationally synchronous
nature of the post-2007 financial crisis, especially in relation to the milder more scattered
crises episodes of the post war landscape. Even “significant global” events, such as the
break-down of the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates, the oil shocks of the
mid-1970s and the emerging market debt crisis of the early 1980s, pale in comparison in
terms of the incidence of crises and impacts on the real economy. Indeed, the ouput
declines registered in many advanced and emerging market economies in 2009 rank

7

among the largest declines in the history of the national income accounts. In several
countries, the declines in real GDP during the second great contraction (2008-2009)
matched and even exceeded those recorded during severe “home grown” financial crises.
This list includes such diverse countries (crisis year in parentheses) as Finland (1991);
Mexico (1995); Singapore (1982); Spain (1977); Sweden (1991); Turkey (2001), among
others.
Having suggested that the severity of this crisis is on a different scale from the
post-war norm, it is logical sequel to expect that the aftermath of the crisis will, in all
likelihood, also depart from the “standard” post-war recession-recovery pattern. To this
end, the next section summarizes selected empirical findings of the RR study on the
aftermath of severe financial crises.

III. The Aftermath of Financial Crises
Let me begin by observing that, as to the present conjuncture in the United States,
the post-war recession experience should not be seen as an instructive benchmark for
where we are at present or what we should expect. The average NBER post-war
recession lasts less than a year. The worst one lasted 16 months. We passed those
milestones.
Broadly speaking, financial crises are protracted affairs. More often than not, the
aftermath of severe financial crises share three characteristics. First, asset market
collapses are deep and prolonged. Real housing price declines average 35 percent
stretched out over six years. Second, the aftermath of banking crises is associated with
profound declines in output and employment. The unemployment rate rises an average of
8

7 percentage points over the down phase of the cycle, which lasts on average over four
years. Third, the real value of government debt tends to explode, rising an average of 86
percent in the major post–World War II episodes. Interestingly, the main cause of debt
explosions is not the widely cited costs of bailing out and recapitalizing the banking
system. In fact, the biggest driver of debt increases is the inevitable collapse in tax
revenues that governments suffer in the wake of deep and prolonged output contractions.
1. Unemployment
To illustrate, Figure 3 examines unemployment rates in the wake of the 14 worst
financial crises in the post war. And what the left panel shows is the increase in the
unemployment rate from the low point to the high point. So, it’s the cumulative increase
in unemployment for that particular crisis. What the right panel shows is the duration in
years of the time it takes to go from the lowest unemployment level to the highest. On
average from bottom to peak, unemployment increases by about 7 percentage points
during the worst financial crises. In the U.S. context, low point in unemployment in 2006
was around 4 percent-a 7 percentage point increase would take it to 11 percent. The
average duration (bottom to peak) is 4.8 years.
These indices are the official unemployment rates; we are now all aware of more
encompassing measures, such as U6 that are much higher than this when you take into
account underemployment and so on. That’s not reflected in these numbers.
To reiterate, recovery in the aftermath of severe financial crises are protracted
affairs, in general.

Notes: Each banking crisis episode is identified by country and the beginning year of the crisis. Only major
(systemic) banking crises episodes are included, subject to data limitations. The historical average reported does not
include ongoing crises episodes.

2. Public debt
Where there is a substantial economic downturn, high and rising unemployment,
and imploding real estate prices – major fiscal consequences should be expected. Not
surprisingly, the true legacy of a major financial crisis is more government debt. Figure 4
shows the rise in real government debt in the three years following a banking crisis. The
deterioration in government finances is striking, with an average debt rise of over 86
percent. We look at percentage increase in debt, rather than debt-to-GDP, because
sometimes steep output drops would complicate interpretation of debt–GDP ratios. As RR
10

(2009) note, the characteristic huge buildups in government debt are driven mainly by
sharp falloffs in tax revenue.
Importantly, however, another major contributor to the public debt buildup in past
crises as well as the current one if the fact that private debts before a crisis become public
debts afterwards. Nowhere is this pattern more evident in recent history that in Ireland,
where the debt/GDP of general government stood at around 25 percent in 2007 and has
since more than quadrupled. 5 In the United States, in early 2010 the transfer of the two
mortgage giants, Fannie and Freddie, added 25 percent to the general government’s debtto-GDP ratio.

Reinhart (2010) documents numerous episodes where private debts ended up in the public sector balance
sheet.

later, and debt stock comparison here is with three years after the beginning of the banking crisis.

IV. Causes, Symptoms, and Amplifiers of Financial Crises
As to the causes of these great crises, we next focus on those factors that are
common across time and geography; we discriminate between root causes of the crisis, its
symptoms, and features such as financial regulation which serve as amplifiers of the
boom-bust cycle. Pertinent to the globalization theme of this conference, the discussion
begins with the link between financial liberalization (internal and external), the financial
innovation and credit booms these spawn and banking crises.
1. The roots
12

There is a striking correlation between freer capital mobility and the incidence of
banking crises, as shown in Figure 5. Periods of high international capital mobility
have repeatedly produced international banking crises, not only famously as they did in
the 1990s, but historically. The figure plots a three-year moving average of the share of
all countries experiencing banking crises on the right scale. On the left scale, we graph
the index of capital mobility, due to Obstfeld and Taylor (2004), updated and back cast
using their same design principle, to cover our full sample period. While the Obstfeld–
Taylor index may have its limitations, we feel it nevertheless provides a concise summary
of complicated forces by emphasizing de facto capital mobility based on actual flows.
For the post-1970 period, Kaminsky and Reinhart (1999) present formal evidence
on the links of crises with financial liberalization. In 18 of the 26 banking crises they
study, the financial sector had been liberalized within the preceding five years, usually
less. In the 1980s and 1990s most liberalization episodes were associated with financial
crises of varying severity. Only in a handful of countries (for instance, Canada) did
financial sector liberalization proceed smoothly. Specifically, the paper presents
evidence that the probability of a banking crisis conditional on financial liberalization
having taken place is higher than the unconditional probability of a banking crisis.

Notes: This sample includes all countries (even those not in our core sample of 66). The full listing of
banking crises dates are shown in Appendix II. On the left scale, we updated our favorite index of capital
mobility, admittedly arbitrary, but a concise summary of complicated forces. The smooth red line shows
the judgmental index of the extent of capital mobility given by Obstfeld and Taylor (2004), back cast from
1800 to 1859 using their same design principle.

2. The setting
Across countries and over the centuries, economic crises of all type follow a
similar pattern. An innovation emerges. Sometimes it is a new tool of science of
industry, such as the diving bell, steam engine, or the radio. Sometime it is a tool of
financial engineering, such as the joint-stock company, junk bonds, or collateralized debt
obligations. These usually accompany or are a direct result of financial liberalization, as
described above. Investors may be wary at first, but then they see that extraordinary
returns appear available on these new instruments and they rush in. Financial
intermediaries—banks and investment companies—stretch their balance sheets so as not
to be left out. The upward surge in asset prices continues, and that generation of financial
14

market participants concludes that rules have been rewritten: Risk has been tamed, and
leverage is always rewarded. All too often, policy makers assert that the asset-price
boom is a vote of confidence on their regime—that “this time is different”. Only
seldom, to my knowledge, do they protest that perhaps the world has not changed and
that the old rules of valuation still apply.
But the old rules do apply. The asset price rise peters out, sometimes from
exhaustion on its own or sometimes because of a real shock to the economy. This exposes
the weaknesses of the balance sheets of those who justified high leverage by the
expectation of outsized capital gains. Many financial firms admit losses, and some
ultimately fail. All those financial firms hunker down, constricting credit availability in
an effort to slim their balance sheets. With wealth lower and credit harder to get,
economic activity typically contracts. Only after the losses are flushed out of the financial
system and often with the encouragement of lagging monetary and fiscal ease does the
economy recover.
3. The symptoms
The recurring historical pattern described above is associated with some welldefined symptoms. I will focus here on a few of the symptoms or quantitative parallels
(those listed in Table 1) that have been present during the current crisis in several
countries and that we have seen systematically in numerous earlier crises in advanced and
emerging market economies alike. 6 Specifically, large capital inflows, sharp housing and
equity price run-ups lead the “leading indicator” group. So have been surges in private

6

These and other economic and financial indicators are analyzed in detail in Kaminsky and Reinhart
(1999).

15

domestic and external debts. These symptoms are quantifiable, unlike the more nebulous
amplifiers that are discussed in the remainder of this section.
.
Table 1. Quantitative antecedents of financial crises:
The “lead” of the leading indicators
Large capital inflows
Sharp run-ups in equity prices
Sharp run-ups in housing prices
Inverted V-shaped growth trajectory
Marked rise in indebtedness

If we were to quantify periods of capital flow bonanzas -- periods where capital
inflows are unusually large -- who comes up on the radar screen prior to the 2007-2009
crisis? As Reinhart and Reinhart (2008) document, in addition to the U.S. and the U.K.,
the other names that are listed there -- Spain, Italy, Iceland, Ireland -- are all countries
that have had a period where the large capital inflows ended badly. Capital inflows
facilitate domestic lending, fuel asset prices, and in most instances increase the
indebtedness of the private sector, the public sector (if the government behaves
procyclically), or both.

Notes: For the full list of recent bonanza episodes see the
paper.

There is a sense that the U.S. housing price bubble during 2000-2006 (primarily)
is both unique and unprecedented. The magnitude of the bubble is certainly
unprecedented to the United States--at least during the past century for which we have
comparable data. However, in a broader global context, the sub-prime bubble is neither
unique to the U.S. nor it magnitudes out of line with other real estate bubbles that have
also ended equally lamentably in financial crises.
Figure 6 compares the run-up in housing prices over 2002-2006. The red bar
highlights the countries that had systemic banking crises. While the housing bubble in
the run-up to the subprime crisis in the US is now infamous, the chart illustrates that the
pattern of a housing price boom ahead of the financial crisis was hardly unique to the US
case. Indeed, it is fully compatible with the “standard” antecedents of a crisis, as
discussed demonstrated in Reinhart and Rogoff (2009).

17

The boom in real housing prices (or real estate, and other asset prices, more
broadly) is fueled by ample domestic credit availability, large capital inflows, and the easy
liquidity environment that, and that this facilitates the boom. Coupling the ample liquidity
environment with the presumption that this time is different and that the old rules of
valuation do not apply, then you have the makings or the ingredients for a crisis.
As to growth (inverted V-shaped pattern) -- growth does very well ahead of the
crisis when credit is ample and wealth effects are positive (as asset prices climb) and falls
subsequently. For further evidence the reader is referred to RR.
I cannot stress enough the importance of the last entry in Table 1, a marked rise
in indebtedness. Rising indebtedness can be domestic, external or both. In can be private,
public or both. Any combination of these forms of rising indebtedness has been a
hallmark of the pre-crisis period as far back as our data can take us. Perhaps Iceland
illustrates this point in its most extreme form, as external debts rise from about 90 percent
of GDP in 2000 to well over 900 percent of GDP in 2009. It is worth noting that stating
that there are capital inflows is usually a different of observing that a country is borrowing
from the rest of the world.

The list (shown on Table 3) of what I have dubbed the “usual suspects” (which

ranges from pro-cyclical macroeconomic policies to overvalued currencies and myopic
rating agencies) despite its breadth is not meant to be exhaustive. It is a list that has
withstood the test of time, as several of these amplifiers come up on a recurring and it is
those are not unique to the United States subprime crisis. Countless case studies of
banking crises, across countries and time (see references in RR) list these factors on a
recurring basis--often blamed as underlying causes of the crises. However, it is my view
that these factors exacerbate both the boom and bust phases of the crisis cycle. For
example, the stylized evidence presented in Caprio and Klingebiel (1996) suggests that
inadequate regulation and lack of supervision at the time of the liberalization may play a
key role in explaining why deregulation and banking crises are so closely entwined. But
it is difficult to explain a cycle with a constant. Supervision may have always been
lacking and the regulations ill defined. But such deficiencies may have limited
consequences when credit conditions are tight (or in the case of emerging markets when
access to international capital markets is not possible). If, on the other hand, financial
liberalization (domestic an external) create lending possibilities that did not exist before,
then inadequate supervision can make a bad lending scenario worse. Outright fraud,
(often through connected lending) which crops up as another hardy perennial in studies of
the run-up to crises works the same way.
The procyclicality of credit ratings (both at the sovereign and corporate levels, see
Reinhart, 2002) also acts to amplify the cycle of lending and subsequent default and

20

crash. Overvalued currencies are a magnet for capital inflows while procyclical fiscal
policies add to the surge in borrowing during the boom phase of the cycle.
Far from being mutually exclusive many, if not most of the items in this list are
present simultaneously in the most severe financial crises through out history.

5. A digression on the sequencing of crises
Just as financial crises have common macroeconomic antecedents in asset prices,
economic activity, external indicators and so on, so common patterns appear in the
sequencing (temporal order) in which crises unfold. Obviously not all crises escalate to
the extreme outcome of a sovereign default. Yet, advanced economies have not been
exempt from their share of currency crashes, bouts of inflation, severe banking crises,
and, in an earlier era, even sovereign default. The point of this short digression is to note
that the long debt cycle we have discussed does not necessarily end with a banking
crisis—more bad news usually follows—a stylized fact that should be kept in mind when
trying to make sense of the current conjuncture.
Investigating what came first, banking or currency crises, was a central theme of
Kaminsky and Reinhart’s (1999) “twin crises” work; they also concluded that financial
liberalization often preceded banking crises; indeed, it helped predict them. DemirgüçKunt and Detragiache (1998), who employed a different approach and a larger sample,

21

arrived at the same conclusion. Reinhart (2002) examined the currency crash–external
default link. Our work here has investigated the connections between domestic and
external debt crises, inflation crises and default (domestic or external), and banking crises
and external default. 7 Figure 7 maps out a “prototypical” sequence of events yielded by
this literature.
As Diaz-Alejandro (1985) narrates in his classic paper about the Chilean
experience of the late 1970s and early 1980s, “Goodbye Financial Repression, Hello
Financial Crash,” financial liberalization simultaneously facilitates banks’ access to
external credit and more risky lending practices at home. After a while, following a
boom in lending and asset prices, weaknesses in bank balance sheets become manifest
and problems in the banking sector begin. 8 Often these problems are more advanced in
the shakier institutions (such as finance companies) than in the major banks.
The next stage in the crisis unfolds when the central bank begins to provide
support for these institutions by extending credit to them. If the exchange rate is heavily
managed (it does not need to be explicitly pegged), a policy inconsistency arises between
supporting the exchange rate and acting as lender of last resort to troubled institutions.
The very numerous experiences in these studies suggest that (more often than not) the
exchange rate objective is subjugated to the lender of last resort role of the central bank.
Even if central bank lending to the troubled financial industry is limited in scope, the
central bank may be more reluctant to engage in an “interest rate defense” policy to

7

Reinhart and Rogoff (2004) also examined the relationship between currency crashes and inflation as well
as the currency crash–capital control (specifically, dual or multiple exchange rates) timing.

In contrast to other studies of banking crises, Kaminsky and Reinhart (1999) provide two dates for each
banking crisis episode—the beginning of a banking crisis and the later peak.

the sequence illustrated in Figure 7 to the box labeled currency crash.

The depreciation or devaluation, as the case may be, complicates the situation in
(at least) three dimensions: (a) it exacerbates the problem of the banks who have
borrowed in a foreign currency, worsening currency mismatches; (b) inflation usually
worsens (The extent to which the currency crisis translates into higher inflation is highly
uneven across countries, as countries with a history of very high and chronic inflation
usually have a much higher and faster pass-through from exchange rates to prices); and
(c) if the government has foreign currency–denominated debt, the currency depreciation
increases the odds of an external and domestic default.

23

At this stage, the banking crisis either peaks following the currency crash, if there
is no sovereign credit crisis, or keeps getting worse as the crisis mounts and the economy
marches toward a sovereign default (the next box in Figure 7).
This is a very common pattern in the sequencing of crises. Notice the first entry
there has financial liberalization. And financial liberalization is really not just
liberalization proper, but big innovation, creations of new market. In the current
conjuncture, the creation or the growth of securitization of mortgages is a big factor.
Notice, perhaps more grimly, that the last entry is a debt crisis, which brings me to my
remarks on debt resolution.
V. From Goodbye Financial Repression, Hello Financial Crash to Goodbye
Financial Crash-Hello Financial Repression?
Periods of high indebtedness have historically been associated with a rising
incidence of default or restructuring of public and private debts. Sometimes the debt
restructuring is subtle and takes the form of “financial repression.” In the heavily
regulated financial markets of the Bretton Woods system, a variety of restrictions
facilitated a sharp and rapid reduction in public debt/GDP ratios from the late 1940s to
the 1970s. Reinhart, Kirkeegard, and Sbrancia (2011) document the resurgence of
financial repression in the wake of the ongoing financial crises and the accompanying
surge in public debts in advanced economies. This cycle in financial regulation, is
perhaps the last box in the flow chart shown in Figure 7.
In light of the record or near-record levels of public and private debt, deficit/debt
reduction strategies are likely to remain at the forefront of policy discussions in most of

24

the advanced economies for the foreseeable future. 9 Throughout history, debt/GDP ratios
have been reduced by (i) economic growth; (ii) a substantive fiscal adjustment/austerity
plans; (iii) explicit default or restructuring of private and/or public debt; (iv) a sudden
surprise burst in inflation; and (v) a steady dosage of financial repression that is
accompanied by an equally steady dosage of inflation. (Financial repression is defined in
Box 1) It is critical to clarify that options (iv) and (v) are only viable for domesticcurrency debts (the euro area is a special hybrid case). Since these debt-reduction
channels are not necessarily mutually exclusive, historical episodes of debt reduction
have owed to a combination of more than one of these channels.
Financial repression is most successful in liquidating debts when accompanied by a
steady dose of inflation. Low nominal interest rates help reduce debt servicing costs
while a high incidence of negative real interest rates liquidates or erodes the real value of
government debt. Inflation need not take market participants entirely by surprise and, in
effect, it need not be very high (by historic standards).

1. Financial repression defined
Financial repression includes directed lending to the government by captive
domestic audiences (such as pension funds or domestic banks), explicit or implicit caps
on interest rates, regulation of cross-border capital movements, and (generally) a tighter
connection between government and banks, either explicitly through public ownership of
some of the banks or through heavy “moral suasion”. Financial repression is also
sometimes associated with relatively high reserve requirements (or liquidity
9

See Reinhart and Rogoff (2010).

25

requirements), securities transaction taxes, prohibition of gold purchases (as in the US
from 1933 to 1974), or the placement of significant amounts of government debt that is
nonmarketable.
In the current policy discussion, financial repression issues come under the broad
umbrella of “macroprudential regulation.”
We suggest that the combination of high public and private debts in the advanced
economies (and the attendant pressures towards creating captive audiences for
government debt) and the perceived dangers of currency misalignments and
overvaluation in emerging markets facing surges in capital inflows (and, thus, the
pressures towards currency intervention and capital controls) interact to produce a “home
bias” in finance and a resurgence of financial repression. It is not called financial
repression but unfolds in the context of “macroprudential regulation.”
Succinctly, while emerging markets may increasingly look to financial regulatory
measures to keep international capital “out” (especially as the expansive monetary policy
stance of the US and others persists), advanced economies have incentives to keep capital
“in” and create a domestic captive audience to facilitate the financing for the high
existing levels of public debt. Concerned about potential overheating, rising inflationary
pressures and the related competitiveness issues, emerging market economies are altering
the regulatory frameworks that deter cross-border financial flows in their eternal quest for
higher yields. This offers advanced and emerging market economies the common ground
of agreeing to increased regulation and/or restrictions on international financial flows
and, more broadly, the return to more tightly regulated domestic financial environment—
often referred to as “financial repression.”

26

2. Negative real interest rates during 1945-1980 and again post-2008
One of the main goals of financial repression is to keep nominal interest rates
lower than would otherwise prevail. This effect, other things equal, reduces the
governments’ interest expenses for a given stock of debt and contributes to deficit
reduction. However, when financial repression produces negative real interest rates and
reduces or liquidates existing debts, it is a transfer from creditors (savers) to borrowers
(in the historical episode documented in Reinhart and Sbrancia, 2011 and summarized
here--the government).
The financial repression tax has some interesting political-economy properties.
Unlike income, consumption, or sales taxes, the “repression” tax rate (or rates) are
determined by financial regulations and inflation performance that are opaque to the
highly politicized realm of fiscal measures. Given that deficit reduction usually involves
highly unpopular expenditure reductions and (or) tax increases of one form or another,
the relatively “stealthier” financial repression tax may be a more politically palatable
alternative to authorities faced with the need to reduce outstanding debts.
Liberal capital-market regulations and international capital mobility reached their
heyday prior to World War I under the gold standard. However, the Great Depression,
followed by World War II, put the final nails in the coffin of laissez-faire banking. It was
in this environment that the Bretton Woods arrangement of fixed exchange rates and
tightly controlled domestic and international capital markets was conceived. The result
was a combination of very low nominal interest rates and inflationary spurts of varying

27

degrees across the advanced economies. 10 The obvious results were real interest rates-whether on treasury bills (Figure 8), central bank discount rates, deposits or loans—that
were markedly negative during 1945-1946.
For the next 35 years or so, real interest rates in both advanced and emerging
economies would remain consistently lower than the eras of freer capital mobility before
and after the financial repression era. In effect, real interest rates were, on average
negative. Binding interest rate ceilings on deposits (which kept real ex-post deposit rates
even more negative than real ex-post rates on treasury bills) “induced” domestic savers to
hold government bonds. What delayed the emergence of leakages in the search for
higher yields (apart from prevailing capital controls) was that the incidence of negative
returns on government bonds and on deposits was (more or less) a universal phenomenon
at this time. The frequency distributions of real rates for the period of financial
repression (1945-1980) and the years following financial liberalization shown in Figure
8, highlights the universality of lower real interest rates prior to the 1980s and the high
incidence of negative real interest rates.
A striking feature of Figure 8, however, is that real ex-post interest rates (shown
for treasury bills) for the advanced economies have, once again, turned increasingly
negative since the outbreak of the crisis. Real rates have been negative for about one half
of the observations and below one percent for about 82 percent of the observations. This
turn to lower real interest rates has materialized despite the fact that several sovereigns

have bee teetering on the verge of default or restructuring (with the attendant higher risk
premia). Real ex-post central bank discount rates and bank deposit rates (not shown
here) have also become markedly lower since 2007.
No doubt, a critical factor explaining the high incidence of negative real interest
rates in the wake of the crisis in the aggressively expansive stance of monetary policy
(and more broadly, official central bank intervention) in many advanced and emerging
economies during this period. This raises the broad question of to what extent current
interest rates reflect market conditions versus the stance of official large players in
financial markets. A large role for non-market forces in interest rate determination is a
key feature of financial repression.

Concluding reflections
I have already discussed the consequences of high public and private debts in the
advanced economies and the attendant pressures towards financial repression to ease the
burden of debt servicing. Not discussed here but a re-enforcing trend isthe perceived
dangers of currency misalignments and overvaluation in emerging markets, and the
attendant pressures towards currency intervention and capital controls—connected to the
broader issue of “macroprudential regulation” a part of the evolving trend toward greater
financial repression.
The two sets of pressures on central banks, in the North and South, are
complementary. While emerging markets may increasingly look to financial regulatory
measures to keep international capital “out” (especially as the expansive monetary policy
stance of the US and Europe persists-as it is likely), advanced economies have incentives
to keep capital “in” and create a domestic captive audience to facilitate the financing for
the high existing levels of public debt. Concerned about potential overheating, rising
inflationary pressures and the related competitiveness issues, emerging market economies
may welcome changes in the regulatory landscape that keep financial flows at home
rather than let them spill across borders. This offers advanced and emerging market
economies the common ground of agreeing to increased regulation and/or restrictions on
international financial flows and, more broadly, the return to more tightly regulated
domestic financial environment—“financial repression.”
The scenario sketched here entails both financial de-globalization (the reappearance of home bias in finance) and the re-emergence of more heavily regulated
domestic financial markets. As some of these trends are already unfolding in individual

31

countries, it is a useful exercise to examine these developments as part of a broader
global picture.
