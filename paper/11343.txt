Gender, Body Mass and Economic Status

NBER Working Paper No. 11343

JEL No. I0
ABSTRACT
Previous research on the effect of body mass on economic outcomes has used a variety of methods
to mitigate endogeneity bias. We extend this research by using an older sample of U.S. individuals
from the PSID. This sample allows us to examine age-gender interactive effects. Through siblingrandom and fixed effects models, we find that a one percent increase in a woman's body mass results
in a .6 percentage point decrease in her family income and a .4 percentage point decrease in her
occupational prestige measured 13 to 15 years later. Body mass is also associated with a reduction
in a woman's likelihood of marriage, her spouse's occupational prestige, and her spouse's earnings.
However, consistent with past research, men experience no negative effects of body mass on
economic outcomes. Age splits show that it is among younger adults where BMI effects are most
robust, lending support to the interpretation that it is BMI causing occupational outcomes and not
the reverse.

A handful of recent studies have used various methods to provide estimates of the
effect of body mass on economic outcomes free from bias due to endogenous effects
(Averett and Korenman 1996; Averett and Korenman 1999; Baum II and Ford 2004;
Cawley 2004). We add to this line of research estimates from a much older sample of
individuals from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). We use this older sample
to explore gender-age interaction effects of body mass and, more importantly, to provide
counterfactual tests of the causal effect of body mass on economic outcomes. We also
examine the effects of body mass on occupational prestige, which has not been explored
in previous research. This is significant because occupational prestige may display
different results as it may better reflect the permanent component of income and/or job
characteristics that are less endogenous to other family level factors than income or
wages (which may be responsive to household bargaining dynamics, substitution effects
with respect to leisure, and which may display income effects on food consumption).

Previous Research on Body Mass and Economic Outcomes
We are not the first researchers to broach the topic of the relationship between
BMI and economic outcomes. Register and Williams (1990) use data from the National
Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) to compare individuals who were 18 to 25 years
old in 1982 (using a definition of obesity of >20 percent of recommended weight for
height and sex) to examine wage rates. Correcting for a number of measured factors that
would affect wage rates—such as union status, race, work experience and industrial

1

category among others—they find that obese women earn 12 percent less than their nonobese counterparts. For obese men, the wage penalty is five percent.1
A second study also uses the NLSY to examine the impact of obesity on several
economic outcomes: education level, household income, marriage probabilities, poverty
probabilities, likelihood of graduating from college and a self-esteem index (Gortmaker
et al. 1993). With the exception of self-esteem, women who were obese between the ages
of 16 and 24 suffered from worse outcomes seven years later, at ages 23 to 31. When a
number of background measures were held constant, differences in marital status,
income, poverty rates and years of schooling remained significant. The only outcome for
which obesity was significant for men was marriage propensity. Their results are robust
to the inclusion of a variable for work-related health limitations. Thus, they interpret the
residual differences as resulting from discrimination.
However, as Cawley (2004) notes, the correlation between body mass and
economic status may be due to (1) a negative causal effect of body mass on economic
status through mechanisms of employer discrimination or reduced health and
productivity, (2) a negative causal effect of economic status on body mass, or (3) a
spurious correlation between the two due to unobservable variables correlated with both
lowered economic status and increased body mass. Only a handful of studies have
attempted to deal with these confounding factors. Research by Averett and Korenman
(1996) and Gortmaker et al. (1993) relies on a lagged body mass variable which mitigates
bias due to reverse causality as body mass of years ago is more endogenous to current

Pagan and Davila (1997) examine social sorting into occupational sectors and find that
men are able to mitigate the possible effects of obesity on wages through occupational
sector mobility in a way that women are not able to.

economic status than is current body mass. Research has also used individual-fixed
effects (Baum II and Ford 2004) or sibling-fixed effects (Averett and Korenman 1996;
Baum II and Ford 2004; Cawley 2004) to control for unobserved family-level
heterogeneity.2 We discuss these studies and their findings in detail below.
Averett and Korenman (1996) use an NLSY sample to examine wage rate
differentials (which would be a more direct test of discrimination) in addition to breaking
down income differentials into components related to the job market (wages) and the
marriage market (likelihood of being married and spouse’s earnings). The authors employ
sibling fixed-effects models as a stricter control for family background characteristics.
They find that obesity effects for women are significant, but that men apparently only
suffer mild economic sanctions, if any. This “obesity effect” is most profound for white
women, and is primarily concentrated in the marriage market.3 Specifically, differences

2

Behrman and Rosenzweig (2001) use a twin-differencing approach that also attempts to
mitigate endogenous body mass and socioeconomic status effects. They examine 402
MZ-twin pairs from Minnesota and find that “The significant inverse association between
adult BMI and wages found in cross-sectional estimates solely reflects a correlation
between unmeasured earnings endowments and BMI, and disappears with control for
endowments common to monozygotic (MZ) twins… The significant positive association
between adult height and wages found in cross-sectional estimates is increased
substantially with control for endowments.” This finding was later dropped in a revision.
It does seem entirely plausible that endowment heterogeneity would work in opposite
directions for height and BMI effects; further, results from Minnesota MZ-twin
differences in BMI and height are of questionable generalizability to the US population
as a whole.

In fact, overweight black women earn about eight percent more per hour than do obese
white women. For a variety of social, political and historical reasons, there are fewer
social and economic penalties for overweight black women. However, we should not take
this to mean that black women’s life outcomes are somehow less dependent on physical
attractiveness. Instead, a comparably important measure of beauty for black women is
that of their skin color. Indeed, despite some gains made with the “Black is Beautiful”
mantra during the 1960s and 70s, lighter-skinned African-Americans are still more likely
to be considered physically attractive than are their darker peers (and enjoy higher SES
3

in marriage probabilities between overweight and normal weight women account for 50
to 95 percent of their lower economic status. However, sister fixed effects wipe out these
obesity effects for all models except one (predicting total family income without controls
for marital status, children, and age of youngest child).
In a subsequent analysis, Averett and Korenman (1999) examine black-white
differences in the effect of obesity on economic outcomes for women. They examine
outcome variables for individuals at ages 25 to 33 in 1990 and body mass for these
individuals evaluated at ages 17 to 24 in 1982. They find that self-esteem does not
explain differences in obesity effects between white and black women, and that obesity
effects work largely through the marriage market for white women as it significantly
reduces their likelihood of marriage and significantly reduces their spouse’s earnings.
Cawley (2004) also uses an NLSY sample and individual-fixed effects as well as
instrumental variable models. Individual-fixed effects models, which control for all timeinvariant unobservable variables specific to individuals, reveal no negative effect of body
mass or weight on the wages of black women, Hispanic women, and Hispanic men.
There is, however, a significant negative effect of body mass on the wages of white
women that remains in tact after controlling for individual-specific unobserved
heterogeneity. Using a sibling’s body mass as an instrument, Cawley reports an
instrumental variable estimate that is again only significant for white women. While the
Hausman test does not lead to a rejection of equality between OLS and IV estimates, it is

[Hughes and Hertel 1990]), and black men are much more likely to prefer lighter-skinned
black women as their mates (Anderson and Cromwell 1977; Freeman, Armor, Ross and
Pettigrew 1966; Hall 1992; Hill 2000; Hughes and Hertel 1990; Keith and Herring 1991;
Robinson and Ward 1995; Ross 1997; Russell, Wilson, and Hall 1992).

also possible that the sibling’s body mass instrument fails to meet the exclusion
assumption and is directly correlated with an individual’s economic status outcomes.
Having an overweight sibling may lead you down certain status attainment paths.
Likewise, the IV approach does not deal with the problem of unobserved heterogeneity,
since the same lurking variable that is causing the sibling’s BMI to be associated with the
respondent’s in the first stage regression may be associated with the error term in the
second stage. But the fact that Cawley’s results are consistent across these two methods
(and with corrections for measurement error) make this study the most definitive
statement on the casual relationship to date.

The Current Study
While previous studies have used various methods to reduce bias due to
endogenous body mass and economic status outcome effects, their results are limited in
that they all rely on young samples from the NLSY. In contrast, in the current study, we
analyze a completely different survey, the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). The
PSID obtained respondents’ height and weight information during 1986 and the latest two
survey waves available, 1999 and 2001. We compare siblings from these three survey
years who also have valid data on their education level, occupational prestige and
earnings (if employed), marital statuses, and total family income.4 These respondents are
generally much older than the NLSY samples previously used, so they allow for a better
long term sense of the impact of weight-for-height and they allow us to compare younger

For all models, we use a Hausman (1978) test of the null hypothesis that fixed effects
and random effects estimates are not systematically different. When our models fail to
reject the null hypothesis, we interpret the more efficient random effects estimates.

and older individuals. This is particularly important in that older respondents should have
economic outcomes that are largely solidified and not as dependent on body mass.
Ideally, we would like to estimate the causal effect of body mass on
socioeconomic and marital status outcomes without bias due to unobserved family
heterogeneity (as discussed above) and without bias due to reverse causation. Sibling
fixed effects models alone do not effectively eliminate bias due to reverse causality. It is
likely that reverse causality is especially problematic in the current study as
socioeconomic outcomes could be a significant cause of body mass. We follow the lead
of previous research that uses a lagged body mass variable to deal with bias due to
reverse causality. Instead of using a lag of seven years (as do Averett and Korenman
[1996], Cawley [2004], and Gortmaker et al. [1993]), we use a lag of 13 to 15 years. This
is largely by default, as the PSID only includes weight and height variables for years
1986, 1999, and 2001. Therefore, we examine the effect of 1986 body mass on averaged
1999 to 2001 socioeconomic and 2001 marital status outcomes. As a further test of bias
due to reverse causality, we compare estimates for individuals younger than age 35 and
individuals age 35 and older. Because individual socioeconomic outcomes are largely
stable by age 35, we should see witness no effect of body mass on post-age 35
socioeconomic outcomes; rather, if we do, then it suggests that perhaps it is
socioeconomic status causing weight gain in our models.
Our minimum age for inclusion into the sample is 25 and the mean for the sample
is 47.61 in 1986 and 58.70 between 1999 and 2001 (see Table 1, below). This is closer to
peak earning years and after peak childbearing ages and also after most formal education
ends. We examine body mass within random effects and sibling-fixed effects models for

6

three economic status outcomes—occupational prestige, labor earnings, and total family
income. Occupational prestige differences reflect labor market dynamics, mostly (there
is choice as to whether to work and what job to take which is endogenous to marital
outcomes as well). Total family income reflects labor market dynamics as well as
marriage market dynamics. We also examine marital status outcomes (as do Averett and
Korenman 1996; Averett and Korenman 1999) and we examine divorce and spousal
outcomes.

Data and Variables
The PSID began in 1968 with a nationally representative sample of 5,000
American families and has followed them each year since. Needless to say, it is a
complicated study design and cannot be done justice in the space allowed here. For a
fuller description, see Hill (1992) or Duncan and Hill (1989). By virtue of this complex
design, the study has information on the economic histories of families as well as on the
outcomes of multiple children from the same families who were in the original sample,
moved into it, or were born to sample members. We select adult respondents ages 25 and
older who were head or wife of their household in any (or all) years for 1986, 1999 and
2001. Further, these individuals had to have a valid person number for their mother; that
is, their mother had to have been in the sample at some time. They were then linked to
their siblings through this maternal connection. A trivial number (less than 1 percent) of
respondents had a father in the sample but not a mother. The majority had both parents.
But since many more of the fathers were missing, we decided to identify siblings based
on their mother’s identification.

7

Body mass, marital status, and the measures that we used to capture economic
outcomes are described below. The unit of analysis is the sibling, as we have averaged
outcomes from 1999 and 2001 (for economic variables and 2001 values for marital status
variables). Mean values—which generally conform to national averages—are presented
in Table 1.
Occupational Prestige: This is based on Socioeconomic Index Scores (SEI) for
1970 U.S. Census occupational classification codes (Stevens and Featherman 1981).
Hodge-Siegel-Rossi prestige scores (1964) return similar results (analyses not shown but
available from the authors upon request). This variable is logged to the base e.
Earnings: This is measured as the total labor market earnings (logged to the base
e). We also tested a variable for log-hourly wage, and results were similar. We prefer
the total labor market earnings formulation since this reflects both work hours and wages
and thus is sensitive to underemployment as well as wage rates.
Family Income: We tested a number of formulations of income including logged
and unlogged forms; income-to-needs ratios and straight income; and total household
income as well as individual income. We present total household income (logged to the
base e).
Body Mass Index: This is a ratio of weight in kilograms to height in meters
squared. The PSID collects weight in pounds and height in inches. We converted these
measures but excluded all extreme values (weight greater than 400 pounds or less than 70
pounds and height greater than 84 inches and less than 45 inches). In general, BMI
between 20 and 25 is considered healthy weight, BMI under 19 is considered
underweight, BMI between 25 and 29 is considered overweight, and BMI over 30 is

8

considered obese. We use BMI averaged over 1999 and 2001 as an outcome variable and
BMI in 1986 as a predictor variable. These variables are logged to the base e, as they are
positively skewed.5
Marital Status: We examine the effects of BMI on likelihood of being married or
divorced, separated, widowed in 2001 contingent on being married or divorced,
separated, widowed in 1986.
Spousal Outcome Variables: We examine the effect of BMI on spouse’s
occupational prestige and spouse’s earnings measured similarly to respondent’s
occupational prestige and earnings (that is, logged to the base e).
Control Variables: All models control for respondent’s educational attainment in
1986. This is measured as total years of formal schooling completed—a continuous
variable from 1 to 17, with the topcode representing any graduate work, regardless of
whether a degree was received (the PSID does not, unfortunately, distinguish between
various levels of graduate schooling). This is an important control absent in most
previous studies. Education level—at least for individuals over 25—is an important
control variable given its presumed exogeneity to other forms of economic attainment
and its strong association with BMI (particularly since it is more likely that education
affects BMI than the reverse).
Models also control for respondent’s age in 1986 (models are robust to the
inclusion of a quadratic age term as well) and for respondent’s parental status in 1986

5

In addition to body mass, we explore an analysis of height, a different measure
of physical appearance. However, all of our estimates using height as a predictor variable
are insignificant and we do not present them (they are available upon request).

with three dummy variables for no children living in the household, children under age
one living in the household, and children between ages two and seventeen living in the
household. Coefficients remain relatively robust to this control variable (as well as other
specifications—such as using economic status more broadly defined, as opposed to
education level). Finally, previous research (Averett and Korenman 1996; Averett and
Korenman 1999; Cawley 2004) has found significant differences in the effect of body
mass on economic outcomes across racial groups. In random effects models not presented
(but available from the authors upon request), we included a race dummy variable and
estimates were not significantly altered.

Findings
We begin with an initial analysis of the extent to which socioeconomic status,
height, weight, and body mass index cluster within families. To estimate sibling
resemblance, we use a variance decomposition method that follows the strategy for
income used by Mazumder and Levine (2003) and Solon et al. (1991). See Conley,
Glauber, and Olasky (2004) for a thorough discussion of this variance decomposition
method for unbalanced survey design.
Sibling correlations for height, weight, and body mass are calculated for same-sex
siblings and are presented in Table 2, below. We report a .359 correlation in sisters’
height, a .292 correlation in sisters’ weight, and a .332 correlation in body mass. For
brothers, we find a .529 correlation in height (note that this is larger than any other
socioeconomic status correlation save education), a .371 correlation in weight, and a .318
correlation in body mass.

10

These figures imply a significant amount of sibling variation in health-related
physical appearance, especially in body mass—even more than the amount of intrafamily variation in most socioeconomic measures. The degree of variation on these
indicators within families is relevant to the current study because when we run random
effects models of height, weight and BMI on socioeconomic and marital status outcomes,
we find each of these to be significant, controlling for a number of basic demographic
factors.
Table 3 present the effects of BMI on 1999 to 2001 averaged occupational
prestige, earnings and family income, and on the likelihood of being married in 2001
(given not married in 1986) and on the likelihood of being divorced, separated, or
widowed in 2001 (given married in 1986). Model 1 examines the effect of 1986 BMI on
outcomes controlling for 1986 educational attainment and age separately for men and
women. Fixed effects and random effects models are presented. For occupational
prestige, earnings, and income, we present linear random and fixed effects models, and
for marital status models, we present linear probability models.
Similar to previous studies, we find that lagged BMI does not significantly affect
men’s socioeconomic status or marital status outcomes. For women, however, lagged
BMI significantly reduces their current socioeconomic status net of their education and
their age. No previous study has examined occupational prestige, and our finding of
women’s reduced occupational prestige contingent on their body mass is novel. Here we
interpret the random effects coefficient as the Hausman test does not lead us to reject the
null hypothesis of equality between fixed and random effects models. The occupational
prestige (SEI) coefficient is interpreted as an elasticity, where a one percent increase in

11

BMI in 1986 decreases women’s current occupational prestige by .212 percent, net of
education and age. BMI has no significant effect on women’s labor market earnings. This
finding differs from the significant obesity-wage effects reported in previous research—at
least for white women (Averett and Korenman 1996; Cawley 2004). We can attribute
differences between our research findings as due to an increase in our lag time period or
as potentially due to not separating out our analyses by race. However, we ran random
effects models with a race term included and our coefficients did not significantly
change. Our models also differ from previous models by including a control variable for
previous education (measured at the time of BMI collection).
Moving to family income, we see that body mass significantly decreases women’s
family income. A one percent increase in BMI leads to a .602 percent decrease in
women’s family income. 6 Again we interpret the random effects coefficient as the
Hausman test indicates equality between random and fixed effects. Differences between
the random and fixed effects models, especially for women’s family income, appear to be
largely a function of sample size, as both random effects and fixed effects coefficients are
similar in sign and magnitude. Finally, body mass significantly decreases women’s
likelihood of marriage, and it does not significantly affect men’s likelihood of marriage.
Body mass also leads to an increase in women’s likelihood of being divorced, separated,
or widowed in 2001. Whereas previous studies examine likelihood of marriage for all
6

This income effect remains robust in a second model (not presented) where we
included women’s current BMI. Essentially, this model is a sibling-fixed effects
difference-in-difference model as we are modeling the change in women’s BMI between
1986 and 1999 to 2001 controlling for family-level unobserved heterogeneity. We do not
present these results since we are uncertain as to how to interpret the difference-indifference with respect to causal directionality—in other words, is the weight change
over the period causal of the current income or a result of permanent income differences?

12

women, we restrict our sample to women who were not married in 1986 and therefore
provide a cleaner measure of the effect of body mass on marriage market outcomes.7
In general, findings reported in Table 3 indicate that women’s body mass
significantly affects their economic well-being (their occupational prestige, family
income, and marital status). We turn next to the question of how women’s and men’s
body mass affects not only their economic outcomes, but their spouse’s economic
outcomes, as this, too, comprises overall economic well-being. Table 4 reports results
from sibling random and fixed effects estimates of spouse’s 1999 to 2001 averaged
occupational prestige and earnings predicted from respondent’s 1986 BMI. Models are
limited only to individuals married in 2001. Regressions are split by gender and by
marital status in 1986 (men who were not married in 1986 provide an insufficient number
of observations for the models).
Similar to findings reported in Table 3, findings reported in Table 4 show a clear
picture of gender-stratified body mass effects such that body mass confers advantages on
men’s socioeconomic outcomes and disadvantages on women’s socioeconomic
outcomes. From Table 3 we saw that BMI does not significantly reduce men’s current
socioeconomic outcomes and does not significantly affect their marriage market
outcomes. Findings from Table 4 add to this and indicate that in addition to no
deleterious effects of body mass on men’s individual outcomes, men’s body mass is
associated with increased spousal earnings. We interpret the random effects coefficient,
though we note that both random and fixed effects coefficients are of the same sign. A

7

As was the case for total family income, this divorce effect remains robust when we
include women’s current BMI.
13

one percent increase in husband’s 1986 BMI is positively associated with their wife’s
labor market earnings by .628 percent.
This curious finding suggests one of three dynamics. First, it could be that despite
our efforts to deploy lags and sibling differences, there is a lurking variable that causes
higher mass men to marry women with more successful labor market profiles. Second, it
could be the case that women’s career attainment is negatively elastic to their husbands.
In other words, men who fare less well in the labor market induce their wives to raise
their earnings, in a household equilibrium. This dynamic might hold whether or not the
husband’s BMI is causally related to his own labor market outcomes (through a
productivity or discrimination mechanism) or even if it is a spurious association for the
husband. A third potential dynamic explaining this phenomenon is that the higher
household costs associated with the food budget of an overweight husband might directly
induce greater labor force commitment on the part of wives. We attempted an analysis of
wage outcomes which differs from earnings primarily in that it controls for hours worked.
However, missing data for wages and work hours is even greater than for earnings and
occupation, which leads us to have an insufficient number of cases to carry out this
analysis.
Turning next to women, we find that their body mass serves to decrease their
husband’s occupational prestige and earnings. For women married in 1986, a one
percentage increase in the BMI in 1986 leads to a .284 percentage decrease in their
husband’s current occupational prestige. This appears to work similarly across samples of
women, as both random and fixed effects coefficients are similar in sign and magnitude.
The sample of unmarried women is exceedingly small for this type of analysis and their

14

standard errors are inflated. When we turn to husband’s earnings, we see that for women
unmarried in 1986, a one percent increase in their 1986 BMI leads to a 1.085 percent
decrease in their husband’s current earnings. These effects are robust to unobserved
family-level heterogeneity and to endogenous effects of BMI and spousal socioeconomic
outcomes.
A Further Test for Endogenous BMI Effects
All previous causally-attuned analyses of the effect of body mass on
socioeconomic status have relied on data from the NLSY, which provides a relatively
young sample of individuals. In contrast, we rely on an older PSID sample that has a
relatively equal age distribution across survey years. We capitalize on this age
distribution and estimate the effects of body mass on socioeconomic and marital status
outcomes for individuals age 35 and older and individuals younger than age 35. This not
only provides purchase on age-gender interactive effects, but it also provides estimates
purged of bias due to endogenous body mass and socioeconomic outcome effects. We
would anticipate that older people have stabilized socioeconomic status trajectories, so
that any relation between body mass and socioeconomic status for the older cohort is
more likely reflective of reverse causality (although not exclusively, as this older cohort
may still experience health problems that in turn affect their productivity).
Tables 5 and 6 provide some evidence in support of a causal effect of body mass
on socioeconomic and marital status outcomes as body mass has more of an effect on
younger respondents’ outcomes, especially younger respondents’ occupations. Turning
first to Table 5 for older respondents, we see only two significant effects of body mass—
on women’s family income and women’s likelihood of being divorced, separated, or

15

widowed. Controlling for their children, age, and education, women’s 1986 BMI reduces
their current family income by .659 percent. Women older than age 35 in 1986 and
married in 1986 experience a 3.789 increase in the likelihood of being currently divorced,
separated, or widowed. For both men and women sample sizes for unmarried in 1986 are
too low and render analyses of the effect of BMI on marital status not possible.
When we compare these results to younger women, we see that the family income
estimate remains similar in sign and magnitude and that the occupational prestige
estimate becomes significant. For these younger women—that is, women whose
socioeconomic status outcomes may be less solidified—BMI in 1986 significantly
decreases their current occupational prestige by .395 percent. This finding lends support
to our conclusion that body mass causes a reduction to women’s occupational prestige
and not that women’s occupational prestige causes any significant body mass effects.
Unlike occupational prestige, income remains significant across both age groups of
women which leads us to the conclusion that income and body mass effects might be bidirectional, meaning that higher total family income may raise BMI through its effect on
food budgets.

Summary
Extending previous research, we report significant effects of women’s body mass
on their socioeconomic status and marital status outcomes. We find a robust effect of
body mass on women’s family income, such that a one percent increase in body mass
decreases their family income by about six percent. We cannot, however, rule out the
possibility that this is partially due to endogenous BMI and income effects, as the income

16

effect remains intact even after we separate our analyses into older and younger women.
We can, however, be more confident that the observed effects of body mass on
occupational prestige are likely to be causal since they only appear in the younger cohort.
Among women younger than age 35 in 1986, a one percentage point increase in body
mass reduces their occupational prestige by about .4 of a percentage point. And to the
extent that we can call insignificant effects of body mass robust, then we find robust
insignificant effects for men. Across younger and older cohorts, body mass does not
reduce their economic status outcomes, it does not reduce their likelihood of marriage,
and it does not increase their likelihood of divorce, separation, or widowhood. In fact, the
only significant effect of men’s body mass appears to be a significant positive association
with their wife’s earnings.
