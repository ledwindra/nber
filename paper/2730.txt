THE SENSITIVITY OF TESTS OF THE INTERTEMPORAL ALLOCATION OF
CONSUMPTION TO NEAR-RATIONAL ALTERNATIVES

ABSTRACT

This

paper presents calculations of the utility cost to consumers of

following alternative decision rules in the environments specified by tests

of the intertemporal allocation of consumption on aggregate data.

The

alternatives include excess and inadequate sensitivity to income and interest

rate changes and ignoring information. The calculations find that the costs

of large deviations from the optimal decision rule- -consumption equal to
current income, for example--are on the order oflc to $1 per quarter. They
are interpreted to suggest that the theory does not make predictions that are

robust to small inaccuracies of modelling, including small costs of
transactions and information, and that those small costs can account for
rejections of the theory as it is applied to aggregate US data.

The Sensitivity of Tests of the Intertelaporal Allocation of
Consumption to Near-Rational Alternatives
*

John H. Cochrane

The theory of the intertemporal allocation of consumption is at the
heart of macroeconomics and finance. Many studies have tested the theory

using aggregate data, in particular as tests of the permanent income
hypothesis and the consumption based capital asset pricing model, and they
often reject the versions of the theory that they specify. However, it's not

clear whether these statistical rejections imply a robust rejection of the
basic theory (in favor of. say, "liquidity constraints") or whether they are

driven by the many simplifying assumptions of tractable and empirically
useful models. The tests have also been criticized (among other reasons) for

exploiting "too fine" predictions of the theory, for example that all
individuals adjust their consumption on a weekly or monthly basis in response
to changes in prospective returns on the stock market.

As one way to address and quantify these doubts, this paper presents

calculations of the utility cost to consumers of following alternative
decision rules in the environments specified by the tests. For example, one

calculation finds the utility loss suffered by an individual who sets
consumption equal to income in each period rather than following the optimal
decision rule specified by the permanent income hypothesis in the environment
of Flavin's (1981) test.

1

These utility costs are typically lOc to $1 per quarter (or 30 to 300

per month), that is,

a steady stream of 100 to $1 per quarter would

compensate the consumer for the utility loss he incurs by following the
alternative decision rule.

The utility costs are small because cyclical

changes in consumption are small and because the utility costs of deviations
from an optimum are an order of magnitude smaller than the deviation itself.
For example, the standard deviation of the growth rate of quarterly real per

capita nondurable consumption in postwar US data is 0.86 percentage points,

and its level in 1986 was about $3500 per year, implying a change of about
$7.50 each quarter. Now suppose the representative consumer makes a mistake,

and consumes $7.50 too little this quarter and (l+r) x $7.50 too much next
quarter, thereby washing out the phenomenon of cyclical consumption changes.
A simple calculation given below shows that this "mistake" implies at most a

6.50 utility loss if the consumer's relative risk aversion coefficient is 1
and a 650 utility loss if his relative risk aversion coefficient is 10.

Why do we care about the utility costs of alternative decision rules?
Suboptimal decision rules that cost a trivial amount of utility or profit are

called near-rational. Near-rational behavior can be most easily interpreted

as small mistakes: people don't literally maximize, they follow heuristic
decision processes that we model by maximization. Their actual decisions may
deviate from the optimal decision rules if the utility costs of doing so are
trivial.

Using this interpretation, Akerlof and Yellen (l985a, 1985b and

1987) argued for the principle that the predictions of a theory should be

2

robust to near-rational behavior, and Akerlof (1979) applied this idea in the

same way as in this paper to show that large deviations form optimal money
holdings carry trivial costs.

In a second interpretation, the small mistakes are made by economists in

modelling the world rather than by the agents we study. Empirically useful
forms of economic theory gloss over many complexities of the decision problem

that consumers actually face.

There are small costs of transactions,

information acquisition, decision,

attention,

etc., as well as

the

(hopefully) small effects of modelling simplifications to one consumption

good, known forms for the distributions of stochastic processes, simple
depreciation schedules for durable goods, etc. We can't know precisely what
effect including these small corrections would have on the predictions of the

theory until we work out a theory that includes them, but we can use the
range of alternate decision rules that cost the consumer (say) $1 per quarter

of utility as a guide to the range of behavior we might expect the theory to
predict if a small (fixed) cost of $1 per quarter were properly included.

More precisely, suppose we calculate the achieved level of utility as a

function of decision rule parameters.

Then we can use this (indirect)

utility function to measure the economic power, just as we use the likelyhood

funâtion to measure its statistical power. The range of alternative decision

rule parameters that generate utility within (say) $1 of the optimum is the
range against which the theory has little economic power, just as the range

of alternative decision rule parameters within a given fraction of the

3

maximum likelihood is the range against which the theory has little
statistical power.

it may happen that a test can statistically reject the optimal decision

rule in favor of alternatives with small utility costs, or that the
likelihood function is more curved than the utility function. This situation

indicates that a statistical rejection might be driven by modelling
simplifications rather than by a failure of the basic theory.

Though

macroeconomics is often accused of not having enough data to statistically

reject any model, such a situation indicates the opposite: that tests are
able

to statistically distinguish alternatives

that are not well

distinguished economically.

One limitation of this interpretation of utility loss calculations is
that we should not expect near-rational decision rules to persist if there
are institutions that can remove them. For example, consumers might be able

to sign over their income streams to a firm, which then makes their
consumption decisions for them and collects the surpluses available from

reducing many consumers' small mistakes, or from reducing their small

information costs if there are increasing returns in the activities
corresponding to those costs.

Pension plans, Christmas clubs, and mutual

funds may in part perform these services for the problems of life-cycle and
intra-year consumption allocations and for portfolio decisions.

paper.

For this reason, propositions derived from dynamic optimization by firms

alone1 may be less sensitive to near-rational criticism.

A suboptimal

decision that costs IBM .1% of its profits is a small mistake from the firm's
viewpoint, but quite valuable to a manager if he can improve the decision and

capture some of the increased profit. Also, a firm that does not optimize
can be taken over by a better set of managers. But there is no analogy to the
market for corporate control at the level of the individual consumer.2

The body of this paper takes two approaches to argue that the range of
decision rules that cost less than about $1 per quarter is in fact large, and
encompasses alternative decision rules that are economically extreme and that
can account for statistical rejections in the environments of common tests of

the intertemporal allocation of consumption on aggregate data.

Section 2

shows that first order deviations from an optimum carry only second order
utility losses, so there are always alternative decision rules for which the
ratio of utility losses to the magnitude of the deviation are as small as one

likes. Section 3 calculates the exact utility losses of following a variety

specific alternative decision rules in environments that are typical of
tests in the empirical literature.

One reason to suspect that the costs of alternative decision rules are

small is that first order "mistakes" in decisions have second order
consequences for utility, or that there are always decisions close to the
optimal one for which the ratio of utility losses to the deviation from the

optimum can be made as small as one wishes.

These points have been most

recently popularized by Akerlof and Yellen in essentially static contexts.
This section extends them to the dynamic and stochastic case considered by
the theory of the intertemporal allocation of consumption.3

The basic idea is most simply expressed in the context of the

A version of the second statement holds near rather than precisely at
the optimum: if f is twice differentiable, we can always choose a point near

the optimum and a deviation from that point so that the ratio of losses to
the deviation is arbitrarily small. This is shown in the appendix.

The only real difference between this statement and the corresponding one for

the finite date and state case is that the size of deviations is
measured by a, instead of by the Euclidean norm of (2.4).

This formulation differs slightly from that in Akerlof and Yellen
(1987). They consider a static maximizer whose objective was the one period

maximization f(x ar). They describe uncertainty by the evolution of a over
time, and their central result is that "inertial behavior"-not changing x in

response to a change in ahas second order effects.

Here I consider an

intertemporal maximizer, and the central proposition is that plans {x) near

(x) have second order costs, which follows directly from the first order
conditions.

Calculations

f Utility Losses

"Second order" does not necessarily mean small: 10062 is larger than
.Olc for a range of €.

This section computes the actual utility costs of

some economically interesting alternatives.

Utility costs depend on the consumer's environment (how much income he
has, how variable that income is, and how rates of return vary over time), on
the consumer's preferences (how he values deviations), and on the alternative

10

decision rules we consider. The environments, preferences and alternatives

in the empirical literature that tests the theory of the intertemporal
allocation of consumption using aggregate data are similar, so there is some

hope that the calculations in typical environments below are reasonable
approximations to the utility loss of a wide variety of similar tests.

Many studies only test for misallocation of nondurable consumption
($2,308 1982 dollars per capita in 1947, $3,484 in 1985), but they use broad

definitions of income, up to and including CM? ($7,330 1982 dollars per
capita in 1947, $14,823 in 1985). If we specify the time series process for
income and ask the consumer for the optimal level of consumption in a model
like (2.5) -

(2.6) we get a total consumption series, which averages about

the same value as the income series. To produce a consumption series whose

level is comparable to that of nondurable consumption, the calculations
assume an income process whose average value is $3,000 per year, and whose

time series properties are the sac as CNP (we can interpret this as a
constant fraction of aMP devoted to nondurable consumption). Utility costs

scale fairly well with income, so the costs in tests that use broader
consumption aggregates are easy to extrapolate from calculations that use
$3000 per year.

Host tests specify either a quadratic or constant relative risk aversion

utility function, and either specify or estimate a risk aversion coefficient
between 1 and 10, and occasionally as high as 30.

paper use those utility functions.

The calculations in this

could raise (or lower) the costs of deviations.5

The alternatives in each case are motivated by the alternatives that

typical tests have found in each environment.

Sections 3.1-3.4 study

economically interesting alternatives, including excess sensitivity and
smoothness in the face of income shocks and slow reactions to changes in
interest rates. Section 3.5 studies the costs of tolerating predictable Euler
errors, which is typically the basis of statistical rejection.

3.1 A Simple Upper Bound

Consider a small increase Ac in consumption at date t, balanced by
future reductions in consumption. By taking Ac as the standard deviation of
aggregate consumption, we will produce a cost per quarter of "mistakes" that

would swamp the variation in aggregate consumption, and hence void any
predictions the theory can make. This calculation can also be interpreted as
an upper bound for the costs of following "reasonable" alternate rules, since

alternatives cannot deviate from the optimum by much more than one standard
deviation if they hope to be a plausible description of the data.

By the first order conditions for optimization, this perturbation has no

first order effects.

Its second order effects must be greater than the

second order effects of changing ct alone, which are

Equation (3.1.2) is a lower bound for the effects of the perturbation,

because it ignores the second order effects of the future changes in
consumption needed to restore the budget constraint.

We can derive upper

bounds for the total effect of the perturbation by considering specific
patterns of future consumption change.

This equation captures much of the intuition of the calculations that

follow: even if "mistakes" Ac are as large as the standard deviation of

13

consumption, that standard deviation is on the order of $10 per capita and
Ac/c is about 1%, so utility costs are less than ioc with risk aversion i

—

and less than $1 with y — 10.

Table 1 presents some evaluations of equation (3.1.4). There is a body

of evidence that nondurable consumption is essentially a random walk (see
Campbell and Deaton (1987) or Cochrane and Sbordone (1988)), so table 1 takes

Ac/c as the standard deviation of quarterly growth rates of nondurable per
capita consumption, and c as its level in 1947 and 1985. The utility losses

range from 4C to $1.94 per quarter for values of the risk aversion
coefficient y between 1 and 30.

The essence of these calculations can also be found (in a completely
different context) in Lucas (1987). Lucas calculated that the utility gain

available from eliminating "cycles" in consumption was small compared to

increases in the "trend", which implies that the utility costs of
"misbehaving" over the cycle are similarly small.

I divided this by 4 quarters/year so

the units are quarterly consumption,

and multiplied by nondurable

consumption/ClIP so the units are comparable to nondurable consumption.

Other k0 simply increase both the optimal and alternative

consumption by rk0 in each period.

Table 2 presents utility costs for several values of the bliss point :

$937.50, $1125, and $1500, or 5/4, 3/2, and 2 times initial income and
initial consumption of $750. The choice of bliss point has no effect on the

utility loss (3.2.9) because the utility function is quadratic,

but it

affects the dollar value of that loss by changing the marginal utility of a
dollar.

The bliss point has not been a focus of empirical work as has the
coefficient of risk aversion, so it is less clear what range of values is
reasonable. Many studies do not report their estimated bliss point when it
is identifiable, and the implied bliss points of many studies are negative or

less than consumption (see Lewbel (1987)).

Since quadratic utility is

usually justified as a local approximation to a more reasonable utility
function, we can assess how reasonable a bliss point is by calculating the
local coefficient of relative risk aversion. This is

(3.2.13) (c,) —

so it is controlled by the ratio of the bliss point to consumption.

This

formula is also the coefficient of risk aversion to time 0 gambles, defined

as (k +

j/r)

V''(k)/V'(k). This can be verified from the formula for the

value function V(k) in the appendix. Table 2 Includes a calculation of this

quantity for each choice of bliss point. Table 2 stops at a bliss point of

1.25 times initial consumption and initial income, corresponding to a

relative risk aversion coefficient of 4 at initial consumption.

In

simulations of the model with lower bliss points (say, 1.1 times initial

consumption for y — 10),

consumption typically exceeded the bliss point

within a few periods,

suggesting that the linear quadratic model

approximation is not useful in this range, because its results will depend
too heavily on past bliss point behavior.

The costs in table 2 are less than 65c per quarter, or .09% of time zero

wealth, and are mostly on the order of 1-bc per quarter or .01% of time 0
wealth. Figure 1 provides some intuition for the small size of the costs by

contrasting a simulation of too sensitive consumption (m+ — 1) with the
optimal consumption path (m* —

.2).

I included the origin of the vertical

axis to emphasize that even with this extreme overreaction to current income,

the level of consumption is not that affected.

Since the consumer values

deviations of the level of consumption from its optimal path, high frequency
deviations cost very little.

For comparison, Flavin's point estimate of the excess marginal

Campbell and Deaton and West test models of this type and find that aggregate
consumption is "too smooth."

We could capture "excess smoothness" by the same kind of alternate
decision rules as in equation (3.2.7), with alternate marginal propensities

at

< 1.

However, this choice produces an alternative decision rule with

several undesirable properties when income follows a random walk.

A way to capture excess smoothness that avoids these problems is to let
the consumer respond to a long moving average of past income rather than to
today's income alone:

determine current consumption, the utility loss is less than $1.28 per
quarter.

An explicit formula for the utility losses in this case is

algebraically complicated. The calculation of utility losses is detailed in
the appendix.

For comparison, Campbell and Deaton (table 6) report point estimates

for the ratio of the actual to predicted innovation variance of (Ac/y1)
between .456 with a standard error of .20 and .147 with a standard error of

.16, depending on which consumption variable they use and the number of
included lags. Under the long moving average alternative, the innovation in

Ac is y/(N+1), so the inverse of the square root of Campbell and Deaton's

ratios, between l// — 1.48 and

l// — 1.16,

is roughly comparable to

(N+l). Hence, their finding of excess smoothness corresponds to a less than
one period moving average of income, and carries utility costs of .ic to 2.7c

3.3 Euler equation tests and

sensitivity

to interest rate changes.

The second major category of tests of the intertemporal allocation of
consumption are the Euler equation tests, following Hall (1979) and Hansen
and Singleton (1983).

The first-order conditions or Euler equations for

maximization of the consumer's problem given in equations (2.5)-(2.6) are
(3.3.1)

u'(c) —

fi E

[a u'(ct1) ]

Hence, if we define 6t÷l by
(3.3.2)

log u'(c) — log

then E(S÷iItime t information) —

+ log u'(c+1) +

0,

which is the basis of tests.

Euler equation tests are often used to test optimal responses to
fluctuations in the conditional distribution of asset returns rather than

optimal adjustment to income changes (in part because the models usually
can't be solved for optimal adjustments to income).

Hence, I examine the

alternative to (3.3.1) that consumers fail to take optimal account of
fluctuations in (real) rates of return.

To create a time-varying returns series, I generated quarterly

real

interest rates by an AR(l),

(3.3.3) a — Pat1 + (t-p) +
I picked the mean interest rate

—

1 + .05/4 and its standard deviation

— .05/4 to give a generous variation over time in interest rates.

22

This

variance is roughly the variance in ex-ante returns that Poterba and Summers
(1987) and Cochrane (1988b) argue is necessary to explain long horizon stock

market data; it is also about the same as the variance of ex-post real
interest rates. A lower variance of interest rates will give rise to less

variance in both optimal and alternate consumption paths, and so lower
utility costs.

I assume that consumers perfectly foresee the path of interest rates.

This makes the calculations simpler; by making only part of the variation

predictable we would again get less variance in optimal and alternate
consumption and lower costs.

Then, the optimal consumption path satisfies

The costs in table 4 rise the longer the moving average of interest

3.4

Costs of ignoring information
In

most studies, the strongest statistical evidence against the theory

comes from predictability of Euler equation errors, rather than from a

statistical rejection of the optimal decision rule in favor of a
well-specified alternative as above. Evidence that E(6÷1IXt) is not zero,
where

is any variable observed at time t, is the basis for rejection of

the model.

But consumers may rightly ignore information variables if the utility
gained by using them to better adjust consumption does not outweigh the costs

of obtaining and processing the information.

If this is so,evidence of

forecastability of Euler errors is not evidence against the basic theory of

intertemporal optimization, and the variable X loses its status as an
instrument.

This section presents calculations of the utility costs of

tolerating such predictable Euler errors.

variable or vector of variables X. We can approximate the utility costs-how
much utility the consumer loses by not readjusting consumption in response to

the information variables XbY considering a perturbation from the optimum,

Ac in (4.1.1), equal to the standard error of the predictable change in
consumption.

In what follows, I'll consider the case of constant interest rates, so
that the standard deviation of consumption changes is equal to the standard
deviations of the Euler error 6t+1'

(The standard deviation of forecastable

returns is typically about the same or less than that of consumption, so this
approximation is not misleading.)

Table S presents some evaluations of (4.1.1) for different values of the

predictability of consumption changes or growth rates, where an

._ Concludinz

Remarks

The calculations presented above suggest that in the majority of current

tests of the intertemporal allocation of consumption on aggregate data,

economically and statistically significant departures from •the optimal
decision rule have small utility costs, less than $1 per quarter or 30c per

month. This suggests that the theory of the intertemporal. allocation of

consumption, applied to a representative consumer with certain typical
preferences and used to explain aggregate phenomena in a period of mild

consumption volatility such as the postwar U.S. •

does

not generate

predictions of behavior that are robust to small misspecifications by

economists or small "mistakes" by consumers, in the sense that both
economically and statistically extreme alternatives (for example, consumption

proportional to income, or consumption growth that is predictable with an
of .25) carry trivial utility costs.

In particular, the utility costs of deviations from an optimal path
depend on the absolute deviation of the alternate path from the optimal path.

Hence, high frequency deviations like lagged responses, temporary misuse of

information, failure to adjust consumption immediately in response to the
information content of typical observable macro variables, and so forth, have

especially low utility costs. But it is the exact timing of the use of
information and the exact timing of consumption changes that has been the
focus of recent empirical work.

28

These observations are both good and bad news for macroeconomic
applications of the theory.

On one hand, they imply that the alternative

behavior that typical tests search for and alternative behavior that can
cause the tests to reject can be generated by small ($1 per quarter) costs of

information acquisition or processing, transactions, etc., so finding those
alternatives is not strong evidence against the basic theory that consumers

intertemporally optimize. On the other hand, it implies that the theory as
it stands provides few predictions about the relationship between aggregate

consumption and asset price or aggregate quantity fluctuations that are
robust to $1 "mistakes" or misspecifications.

These results are not a criticism of dynamic economic theory or its
empirical application in general.

Dynamic optimization by fins may be

exempt because of fins' larger size and different structure.

Studies of

consumption in microeconomic data sets, in which income and investment
opportunities show orders of magnitude greater variation over time and across

individuals than in aggregate data, may well escape the criticism of this
paper. Large utility costs could appear in studies that use aggregate data,

if they include nonstandard utility functions with at least two orders of
magnitude greater risk aversion, other freçuencies (life-cycle allocation
instead of cyclical allocation or period to period orthogonality), or data

sets from other times or countries with orders of magnitude greater
varaibility in consumption.

If a theory departs from the representative

consumer setup of most current empirical work to a disaggregated framework in

which the cyclical variation in consumption is due to only a few people, the

29

costs of misbehavior to those people may be high.

Nonetheless, the calculations and the existence of alternatives with

arbitrarily small ratios of costs to deviations presented in this paper
suggest that calculations such as these are a worthwhile robustness check in
these other environments as well.

where Vec(.) creates a vector by stacking the rows of a matrix. Using

we have
(A.15)

Vec(P) — Vec(R) +

fi (A'@A')Vec(P).

We can't quite collect terms in Vec P and invert because P is symmetric, so
only the diagonal and one off diagonal side can be chosen independently. To
remedy this problem, let M be a matrix that deletes redundant rows of Vec(P),

38

and let N be a matrix that takes N Vec(P) and restores the redundant rows, so
that Vec(P) — N (H Vec(P)). Then, from (A.lS),

I am grateful to George Akerlof, Martin Eichenbaum, Elizabeth

fama, Lars Hansen and two anonymous referees for many helpful comments. This

research was supported in part by a grant from the National Science
Foundation.

tFor example, Cochrane (l988a) presents an asset pricing model derived from
firm's first order conditions.

2J economic theory of the contracting problems that prevent the emergence of

markets in the ownership of people or other institutions that could remove
the small surpluses of cyclical mis-allocation is beyond the scope of this
paper.

Beyond the obvious agency questions and the unobservability of

utility (as compared to earnings), the fact that cyclical allocations ($7.50

more this quarter, $7.50 less the next) are so small compared to other
elements of individual consumption decisions is probably part of the reason
that we do not observe such institutions.

3Jones and Stock (1987) also consider this extension.

46

41n a more formal presentation, we specify an underlying probability space

(O,F,P), and a nondecreasing sequence of sub a-algebras of F, s, that
comprise the consumer's information set. s can be generated by current and
past observations of a collection of observed random variables x(t).

Then

the object that the consumer chooses is a sequence of random variables

c:Q 9

9.

where each c is measurable with respect to St.

5Non-state-separable preferences (see Epstein and Zin (1987) or Kocherlakota
(1988)) are typically adopted to plausibly use a value of the coefficient of

risk aversion or intertemporal substitution around 30.

Utility costs are

roughly linear in the coefficient of risk aversion, so one needs risk
aversion coefficients of 100 or so to get an order of magnitude increase in
utility costs, or $10 per quarter. On the other hand, utility functions that
include durability ("nondurable consumption" includes clothes) allow greater
variation in consumption for the same utility costs.

6The consumer's problem can often be written as a dynamic program,

V(k, At) — max

u(c) ÷ $EV(Rtk +

(c

y c,
-

A+j)

Where At is a listing of shocks. Then, the second order effects are
AU a

*

1
[

u(c)

*

2

+ $E Vkk(kt+l. A1) ]

Ac

Since u(c÷1) < vkk(lct+l. At+1) < 0 the same approximate bounds follow.
Since the functional form of V is often not known, the upper bound in (3.1.4)
is easier to use for order-of-magnitude calculations.

47

7To derive the consumer's optimal decision rule, express the budget
constraint in present value form:

1c +

t+j

—

a.s.

The consumer's first order conditions (2.2) are c —

(

).

Then, take

the expected value of the budget constraint, plug in the first order
conditions to obtain the decision rule:

+

sEp E(Y÷j)

c/r

-

—
O

(Hansen (1987) and Lichenbaum Christiano and Marshall (1988) derive similar
decision rules in more general versions of this model.)

8We can also vary the coefficient on the 1c term in the consumption decision

rule, to r+ instead of r.

As long as l+r-rtl 'C

1/fl the budget constraint

will be satisfied.

9Assessing whether this alternative could generate Flavin's statistical

rejection

*

is a little more subtle.

Though Flavin's estimate of rn-rn

was

nearly 2 standard errors away from 0, the weight of flavin's statistical
evidence came from combined excess sensitivity to eight lags of income rather

than from contemporaneous income alone, and from the predictive power of all
eight lags of income for consumption changes. However, the excess smoothness

alternative considered here generates about the same predictability of
consumption changes (R2) as is found in a replication of flavin's regression

of consumption changes on eight lags of income, which is a more precise
indication that this alternative can account for the statistical rejection.
48

10

The weight of Campbell and Deaton s statistical evidence also came from

predictability of Euler equation errors rather than rejection of the optimal

innovation variance of c/y in favor of these alternatives.

The excess

smoothness alternative generates predictable consumption changes (R2)larger

than those found by Campbell and Deaton, so it can also account for the
statiflical rejection.

more complex environments, for example those that include stochastic
interest rates, we can find utility costs as in the linear quadratic case, by

solving a Bellman-like equation

V(k. shocks) —

u(c)

flEV(k+1,

shocks+1).

after we specify the alternative decision rule relating c to k etc.
