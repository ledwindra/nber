Unemployment—Rate Dynamics and
Persistent Unemployment Under
Rational Expectations
ABSTRACT

This paper develops a model of unemployment rate dynamics that provides
an explanation
persistent

of

persistent cyclical unemployment that does not involve

expectational

errors or other nonoptimizing behavior. Our results

are based on the interaction of search dynamics and inventory adjustments. An
important element in these dynamics appears to be heterogeneity in the labor
force which can be characterized as consisting of a relatively small group of
high turnover individuals who comprise the bulk of normal unemployment and a
larger group of low turnover individuals who dominate movements in cyclical

unemployment. Our empirical results provide support for this theory as we
demonstrate that the appropriately measured probability of becoming employed
during a recovery falls relative to normal because of the unusually high

proportion of low turnover individuals who have lost "permanent" jobs. As a
result, recovery is much slower than is indicated by normal relationships
although each individual is searching optimally.

Macroeconomists typically build models of the determination of real
output with unemployment—rate movements explained, if at all, by an appended

economic shock

having

a prolonged effect on the economy.

In the first section of the paper we develop the partial—adjustment
equation which governs the evolution of the unemployment rate. We show that
if individuals differ significantly in their probability of leaving unemployment, unemployment dynamics imply a much slower recovery from recession than
would be implied by probability values observed

in normal times.

In the second section of the paper we develop new empirical measures of
the fraction of the labor force who become unemployed each month and the
probability that an unemployed person

will become employed or leave the labor•

force in a month's time. These measures and

alternatives ——

equivalent

if all

individual probabilities are the same —— are used to demonstrate that the
unemployed differ substantially in their individual probabilities of leaving

unemployment. We can broadly characterize the labor force as consisting of
two groups: The first group consists

of recent entrants into the labor market

who are in the process of job shopping and other

individuals who have selected

careers in sectors (occupational or industrial) that involve low accumulation

of specific capital. This group is characterized by high rates of entry into
unemployment and high probability of leaving it;

in normal times, the bulk of

unemployment comes from this group. The second group consists of individuals
with high degrees of specific human capital and "permanent" jobs; so they
rarely become unemployed but search for a long time to find a replacement job

when they do become unemployed. Loss of "permanent"
prevalent during recessions because

jobs will be more

firms in declining industries find it

optimal to accelerate eventual reductions

in their labor force at such times.

The slow search process of this second group implies that they dominate

cyclical unemployment during the rcovery from recessions.

3

Further empirical work reported in the third section of the paper

supports the following macroeconomic parable: Money shocks do not directly
effect the proximate determinates of unemployment but do so indirectly through

inventories. High inventories (relative to sales) lead to abnormally and
temporarily high rates of entry of both groups into unemployment.

The high

inventories also may mildly and temporarily depress the probability of leaving

unemployment. The excess unemployment among the high probability group is
quickly eliminated, but those who have lost permanent jobs take many months to

find a new job even though each individuals monthly probability

of success is

no lower that would be the case in normal times. Thus, individual maximizing
behavior leads to substantially persistent effects on cyclical unemployment
and output.

I. Unemployment Dynamics and Persistence
In this section we demonstrate that the logic of the standard search

model implies persistent cyclical unemployment as a result of a single—period

forecast error on the part of searching workers. In this theoretical exposition of unemployment dynamics we abstract from

the notion that some of the

unemployed may not be searchers, but instead may be on temporary layoff,

expecting recall. We do this in order to emphasize the separate role of
search dynamics in yielding persistent effects from uncorrelated errors.
Initially we assume that all workers are identical.

discrete time model. Let u represent the unemployment rate,

implies a persistent effect on unemployment and hence on real output in the

standard search—unemployment model. In the second period, the probability
that each searcher finds a job is at the normal level, but the additional
unemployment engendered in the first period takes time to work off. If we

for inventories, investment projects in process, and other such state

variables. The persistent unemployment and output effects are not due to any
persistent errors on the part of workers or firms, but instead due to the
dynamic process of search in the labor market.

In Sections III and IV below,

we present empirical evidence that the, interaction of inventory and unemploy-

ment dynamics does produce a hump—shaped time path of the unemployment rate in
response to brief unexpected shocks.

LB. Heterogeneous Workers
A second element of employment dynamics which plays an important

role in

explaining the persistence of unemployment subsequent to a macroeconomic shock

is the heterogeneous nature of workers. As a general proposition, it has
become increasingly accepted that heterogeneity across workers is important
for understanding the behavior of unemployment.

Realization that workers in

different submarkets (e.g., demographic, industrial, occupational) may exhibit

different turnover behavior has led to a recognition that the natural rate of
unemployment will vary with the composition of the labor market (see for
example, Wachter 1976, Lilien 1982, and Haltiwanger and Plant l984). Hetero
geneity has also played an important role in the study of the distribution of

unemployment duration. Specifically, the presence of heterogeneity implies a
bias in using the observed (from the BLS household survey) uncompleted spell

distribution to measure the unobserved completed spell distribution (see, for
example, Salant 1976 and Akerlof and Main 1980).

Thus, we are clearly not the

heterogeneity for persistence in unemployment over the business cycle. In
particular, in this section we demonstrate theoretically how heterogeneity is

At present, we are not able to measure (separately) values of 4 and r for
those on temporary layoffs and those who are searchers (all others))3 We
postpone the development of such measures to future research.

we would ideally like to have data that reports the gross

not in the labor force. Unfortunately complete data of this sort are not

estimates of

as the probability

of being recalled from temporary layoff within the month.
'4For a discussion of the availability of and problems with the gross

16

Recall that the Current Population Survey is conducted each month during

the week which contains the 12th day of the month. Thus the typical year has
twelve surveys of which 8 are conducted 4 weeks subsequent to the previous

survey and 4 are 5 weeks subsequent to the previous survey. We find it
convenient to use standard months of 4.35 weeks (30.4 days =

365/12).

Since

0—4 reports the number of people unemployed 31 days or less, it is a good
measure of the people who have become unemployed over the last month.'5 The

number unemployed at the last survey is used to approximate s_i, the number

unemployed exactly one month earlier. The equivalence is exact whenever u1

equals the value 4

toward which the unemployment rate currently

converges as it would, for example, in steady—state equilibrium; otherwise the

interest because the recent work of Lilien (1982) suggests that the industrial

duration data broken down simultaneously by age, sex, industry and occupation
would be required and such a four way classification of this data is not
available. Confronted with the choice of which decomposition matters most, we
chose the age—sex classification. This is because the age—sex breakdown of
the unemployment duration data is relatively more available and previous
studies (e.g., Wachter 1976, Haltiwanger and Plant 1984) have demonstrated
that the age—sex composition of the labor force is very important.

draft was present. The draft after 1970 was a lottery draft. Following Barro

falls off somewhat in the early 1980s. This can be explained by examining the

Evidence of Heterogeneity in

The adjustment of the aggregate measure of it to its equilibrium value,

can be slowed by the presence of heterogeneity in the labor market. As we

showed in Section I.B, if there are two groups with different values of ir

and j.,

aggregate measures of

it

can show persistent deviations from ,

even though within groups there is no persistent deviation from equilibrium
values. Any attempt then to measure persistence in it, and thus u,
requires an empirical characterization of heterogeneity. In this section we
provide empirical evidence of heterogeneity in it.

Let d denote the average duration of unemployment this month for those
who were unemployed last month and are still unemployed, and let

d....1 denote

the average duration c,f unemployment in the previous month for all unemployed

workers. Suppose that all individuals have the same probability of exiting
unemployment,

that is, there is no heterogeneity. Then:

d =

d_1 + 1.

Given a uniform escape probability at any point in time, the average duration
of unemployment for those remaining unemployed in a given month should

27

increase by one month. However, if individuals are heterogeneous, and thus
have different values of

71,

then d will generally exceed d_1+1 because
workers

a disproportionate share of high duration (low it)

remain unemployed

at the end of a month's time.

Given a heterogeneous workforce, on average d will exceed (d_1+l) by
some positive value, call it h.

Thus,

(24)

Let d denote the average duration of people who became unemployed in the
last month. Then the average duration of unemployment in a given month, d,

is simply a weighted average of d and d:

"permanent" jobs would be about 325 months or 27 years. This number is

consistent with the stylized facts about the labor market.27 A 112 of 0.112
would imply that during the recovery from a recession when 112 dominates the
adjustment rate, cyclical unemployment would fall by about a ninth in one
month, a third in a quarter, a half in a half year, and three quarters in a

year's time if all •'s and ii's were at their normal values. Such
persistence may be sufficient to explain the puzzle of why unemployment is
persistent without need for recourse to any substantially persistent

expectational errors which cause 111 and it2

to differ from theIr normal

values for long periods of time. This hypothesis Is considered further in
Section III.

A final implication of using Ill = .55

and 2 = .112

is that normally

79% of the unemployed would be from group 1 and only 21% from group 2.28

However, if we assume that the ir values were at their normal

about 0.459. The unemployment rate of 10.7 percent at that time can be decomposed into 4.91 percentage points due to group 1 and 5.79 percentage points

due to group 2. Group 1 accounts for 4.77 percentage points of the 6.07 per-

centage point value of u, but for only 0.14 percentage points of the total
4.63 percentage points of cyclical unemployment.29 Group 2 accounts for the

This illustrates that the data are

consistent with our theoretical analysis in Sections l.A and I.B: Normal

unemployment is dominated during the recovery from a recession by individuals
who have lost "permanent" jobs and are searching
"permanent" jobs during recessions

III. An Empirical Model of Cyclical Unemployment
The model of unemployment rate dynamics we have developed allows us to
identify four separate potential sources of persistence in cyclical unemploy-

ment, u. First, persistence could be due to the partial adjustment of u

toward u with ii,

• and

y at their normal levels. Such persistence is

pictured in Figure 1. Our estimation of ir in Section II imply that on
average 46% of the unemployed escape unemployment each month which would imply
that during recovery nearly half the cyclically unemployed would find jobs

within a month. However, as we demonstrated empirically in Section II, the
partial adjustment speed may be substantially reduced due to heterogeneity,

with individual

ii,

•, and

y at normal levels. We illustrated this

phenomenon in Figure 2 and the estimates we generated in Section II.C show
that only about one—ninth of the cyclically employed would find jobs within a

month. A third source of persistence might be autocorrelatlon in ir, 4 and
y due to equilibrium adjustments to changes in economic conditions. Finally,
autocorrelation in ii, $

and 'y may be associated with persistent expecta—

tional errors. The first three sources of persistence are consistent with a
rational expectations model of economic agents' behavior, while the fourth
contradicts such a hypothesis.

In this section, we complement the measures of ,

4

in Section II with equations that explain the movement of

and y developed
ir, 4 and y

around those normal levels and with a supplementary equation which links the

movements of inventories and money. This preliminary analysis of the data
raises many questions for future research, but several messages are clear.
First, heterogeneity is an important source of persistence, which confirms the

empirical analysis just presented. Secondly, the data appear to be consistent
with equilibrium models of persistence, with little if any role for

33

autocorrelated expectational errors. Finally, within the simple model we have
chosen to describe, deviations of the unemployment rate from its natural level
are not caused directly by money shocks, but instead through fluctuations in

the level of inventories about its nan. Thus aggregate shocks that cause the
level of inventories to fluctuate, such as unanticipated fluctuations in the
money supply, will affect the cyclical unemployment rate.

III.A. Behavior of the Employment Probability ii
The

standard

search model of unemployment states that

it

is

a function of

unexpected changes in aggregate demand and hence the derived demand for labor.
An unexpected increase (decrease) in aggregate demand shifts the

actual

distri-

bution of wage offers right (left) relative to the expected distribution so that
it

is

increased (decreased) relative to normal. Another, possibly complement-

ary, theory posits that the probability of receiving any offer increases
(decreases) so that the probability it

of

an acceptable offer increases

(decreases). Following Barro (1977, 1978), we use unexpected money

as an

indicator of shifts in aggregate demand. The strictest interpretation of
rational expectations, would posit that only the current value of g
affect

31
it.

We

test this hypothesis by including in our

regression

specification a distributed lag on the current value and first 11 lags of

L32

31For such an interpretation, see McCallum (1979). The basic idea is
that all past information will be incorporated in current expectations and so
will have no effect on real variables except through past effects on current
state variables such as inventories, If lagged values of T were to enter we
would conclude (a) expectations are not formed rationally, (b) the relevant
horizon for forming expectations is longer than 1 month, or (c) some signif 1—
cant state variables have been omitted from the regression. In the latter
coefficients would reflect past effects on the omitted
case, the lagged
state variable(s) and current effects of the state variable(s).

of the probability that a searcher finds an acceptable job, the probability

on the extent to which excess inventories have been eliminated.34 Second,
when inventories are abnormally high, the discounted marginal value product of

labor is abnormally low. Optimal intertemporal leisure substitution implies

estimates are available from 1953—8. This

start date for estimating i was chosen for two reasons: (1) This avoids
essentially all of the period during which the Fed was pegging government bond
prices. The process determining money growth is potentially different during
that period; see Friedman and Schwartz (1963, pp. 613, 625). (2) This is the

section.

33We measure I as the deviation from a linear trend fit to Citibase
data on the inventory—sales ratio for manufacturing and trade. This ratio —
the one—month lagged value of Business Conditions Digest series number 77 ——
has the beginning-ofmOnth total book value (in 1972 dollars) of manufacturing
and trade inventories as the numerator and manufacturing and trade sales for
the prior month (in 1972 dollars) as the denominator. This dating is
appropriate both with respect to the decislonmakiflg of the firm and for the
intertemporal decision—making of individuals.
The linear trend was not estimated directly, but instead is that I
implied by our regression of I on both trend and cyclical variables (see
Table 5 below). The difference is not a substantive one: The correlation

cofficient between our I and the residuals from a linear trend regression is

0.95. Details of how to impute I

from the Table 5 regression are given in

footnote 42 below.

34See Haltiwanger and Maccini (1984) and Topel (1982) for theoretical
results which support the discussion of the interaction of inventories and
layoffs in this section.

35

that some searchers should then drop out of the labor force, but we expect

that in fact many of these individuals would be counted as unemployed due to

unemployment benefit rules. Finally, cyclical fluctuations in inventories
could shift the actual wage offer distribution relative to the expected
distribution.

To capture these inventory effects, the

equation also includes a 12

month distributed lag on I. Intertemporal substitution considerations would
suggest that

should enter because it is the most recent Information

available to workers during the month. From the point of view of firms,

lagged as well as current values of I could enter because if there were
adjustment costs associated with varying employment, it would be optimal for
firms to use inventories to buffer short—run monthly variations in sales.

However, given that there are also costs of varying inventories, successive

monthly variations in the inventory—sales ratio in the sai direction will
make it optimal for a firm eventually to change production and hence employ-

ment. To capture this optimal lagged response of employment to inventories we

include a distributed lag of I as determinants of

it.

To capture the effects of heterogeneity on ,r we use variables that
indicate how the composition of the unemployed has changed over time, In
particular, we are interested in changes in the share of the unemployed who
exhibit high turnover and low duration relative to the share of the unemployed

who exhibit low turnover and high duration. To characterize this simply, we
include the one period lagged share of unemployed who have been unemployed

less than 5 weeks as an explanatory variable in the r equation.
The first column of Table 3 reports the results of OLS regressions of

on the lagged unemployment share of low duration workers, and the 12 month

confidence level. Neither the current money shock nor all 12 coefficients as
a group are significantly different from zero.35 The coefficient on I is

negative and significant and the distributed lag on I is significant as
well.36 In the second column we report a regression which omits the

insignificant lags on money shocks. The I distributed lag is now
significant at the 1% confidence level.37
We interpret these results as indicating that the primary factor
determining cyclical variations in the probability of leaving unemployment is

heterogeneity. Inventory innovations appear to play some role and
surprisingly money shocks have no significant impact. Money shocks may be

insignificant because they operate only through the I or because of measurement error problems, but there is certainly no evidence here of persistent
expectational errors.

The

the distributed lag on I proved quite significant in explaining

large, significant, positive coefficients on I and I(—l) reflect the
increase in layoffs associated with high cyclical inventories. It is not
possible to decompose this into temporary and permanent layoffs, but the

signficant negative coefficient on I(—1l) suggests that variation in the
rate of permanent separations for marginal workers is involved: If a marginal

worker is fired earlier due to high cyclical inventories, +

will

decrease

below normal levels during the latter period when the worker would have

otherwise been fired. The sum of the coeffceuts .s postve confirming

the

notion that high cyclical inventories cause temporary layoffs of employees who

otherwise would never have been unemployed. A similar pattern of coefficients
appears in the distributed lag on

1.

A high value of

reduces the likeli-

hood that workers will be terminated in the first few months, but there is
essentially no effect over a year's time as indicated by the insignificance of

money shocks as a group.4° The right—hand column of Table 4 reports the

results of a regression which drops the insignificant 1 distributed lag.

The "S" shaped pattern of I coefficients is more pronounced than in the
previous regression. Again we conclude that lagged expectational errors from
money shocks account for no detectible persistence in the unemployment rate

except as it is incorporated in I.

39me F(12,321) statistic for testing the null hypothesis that all I
coefficients are zero is 16.01.

40The F(l2,321) statistic for testing the null hypothesis that all 1

coefficients

are zero is 0.716.

43

III.C. Cyclical Behavior of I
Given potential discouraged and added worker effects over the cycle, both

I and t might influence y. In regressions not reported here, we tried
regressing

y on 12 month distributed lags on these variables. The F

statistic on each group of parameters was insignificant and the

2 negli-

gible. We conclude that, while various subgroups of the labor force may have
cyclically sensitive participation rates, the overall growth rate of the labor
force is not sensitive to cyclical factors.

III.D. Cyclical Behavior of the Inventory-Sales Ratio I
Our results so far indicate that to understand the cyclical behavior of
the unemployment rate the determinants of the inventory—sales ratio must be

understood as well. Much research on the cyclical behavior of I is already
underway; so, for our present purposes, it suffices to estimate a simple

partial—adjustment regression of I on time, the lagged dependent variable,
and a 12 month distributed lag on

as our indicator of aggregate demand

shocks. Since I is the ratio of beginning inventories to last month's
sales, the current money shock g occurs too late to affect its value. This
regression is reported in Table 5.

Although the equation is a simple one, it in fact explains the behavior

of the inventory—sales ratio well. The coefficient on I indicates that 9
percent of cyclical inventories are eliminated per month; this corresponds to
25 percent in three months, 44 percent in six months, and 68 percent in a

year's time. The long—run effect of the time trend term is only 0.0004 per

significantly decrease inventories from the first through seventh month. The
gradual build up of production relative to final sales is consistent with

IV. Conclusions
This paper has demonstrated that the fraction 4,
becoming unemployed in a month and the probability

it

of the labor force

of leaving unemployment

over a month are useful con8tructs for understanding how the unemployment rate

fluctuates around its normal level. Furthermore, these variables have
empirical counterparts which we can readily calculate from the aggregate data
on numbers and duration of unemployment.

In addition, we have shown that significant heterogeneity across

individuals in it implies a much slower convergence of u toward u than
would be hypothesized from current or normal values of

ii. We demonstrate

that this heterogeneity is quite substantial in the aggregate data.
The hypotheses supported by our initial exploration of these new data can

be summarized by means of Figure 6. In this figure we distinguish between two
groups: the first is characterized by high. values of

and ir compared

to the second group. Money shocks do not directly affect the proximate

contemporaneous determinants (irk and
ployment rate

of each group's cyclical unem-

but do so indirectly through cyclical inventories I. A

restrictive monetary policy causes I to gradually build up. High I values
may depress the ltj directly, but their main effect seems to be on the

and especially u2 for a period of some months.

Then as the effect of the money shock on inventories is attentuated, u1

quickly returns to normal (u1 goes to 0). But the low turnover group is
characterized by a very low normal probability i2 and this value governs
the speed of adjustment of

(and eventually j) toward 0.

Indeed, it appears that in normal times the bulk of unemployment is

comprised of group 1 individuals. Major recessions have the effect of

diseniploylag very large numbers of group 2 individuals who otherwise have

nearly permanent jobs. Their lengthy process of search for a new permanent
job appears to dominate the recovery period and explain substantial persis-

tence in unemployment. It is not that any individual is taking unusually long
to find a job; it is simply unusual to have so many slow searchers unemployed
at once.

To return to Figure 6, we note that given exogenous labor force shares

and growth rates, we can infer the aggregate values of $, tr,

and u from

the corresponding values for each group. At present, we are constrained to
work with these aggregate data and infer compositional effects thorough

proxies and other indirect evidence. Our first task for future research will
be to develop new measures and evidence to permit us to observe more directly
the nature of labor—force heterogeneity and its influence on unemployment rate
dynamics.
For now we conclude that the observed persistence iii unemployment appears

to be consistent with equilibrium models and rational expectations since we
are unable to detect any effect of lagged ——

Inventories appear to be the key channel transmitting the effects of

increase of 1 percent (.01) per day translates into a 30 percent
increase in the unemployment rate over a month. This would be 1.5 percentage
points on a base of 5 percentage points.

APPENDIX B
CALCULATIONS OF HETEROGENEITY STATISTICS

We measure heterogeneity across individual

-values by h, the amount

by which the unemployment duration d of those currently unemployed since
last month exceeds 1 month plus the average unemployment duration of all

persons last month (cLi). This h, which is 0 if all it1 values are
equal, has a statistical interpretation in terms of the covariance between
duration and changes In shares by duration which can be useful for certain

problems.44 However, we need not be concerned with that interpretation to
understand the derivation of Table 2 in the text.
The table is derived by considering the steady—state solution to the two
