of the Socially Optimal Use
of Liability and Regulation

A Model

ABSTRACT

Liability

and safety regulation are examined

as means of controlling risks in a theoretical model of the

occurrence of accidents. According to the model, regulation
does not result in appropriate reduction of risk -- due to
the regulator's lack of knowledge about risk —-

nor does

liability result in that outcome -- because the incentives
it creates are diluted by the chance that parties would not
be sued for harm done or would not be able to pay fully for

it. Thus, either liability could turn out to be superior to
regulation or the reverse could be true. But as is stressed,
joint use of the two means of controlling risk is generally
socially advantageous, and the characteristics of their
optimal joint use are determined.

A Model of the Socially Optimal
Use of Liability and Regulation

S. Shavell*

I. Introduction and Summary

This paper will study a theoretical model of the occur-

rence of accidents in which the use of liability for harm
done and of regulation of behavior will be examined as means

of controlling accident risks. It will be assumed in the
model that parties may, at a cost, take "care" to reduce
accident risks, and that these risks may vary depending on

their circumstances. It will therefore be socially desirable for parties to choose their levels of care in accordance with their particular circumstances; the greater the
risks that they create, the higher should be their levels of
care.

Neither regulation nor liability, however, will result
in the model in parties taking the desirable, "first-best"

levels of care. Specifically, regulation will not result in
this outcome because the information about risk available to

the regulatory authority will be imperfect. And liability
will not lead to an ideal outcome because parties' incentives
to take care will be inadequate (for reasons to be noted
shortly), and possibly --

to be studied -- because of incompleteness of their informa-

—2—

tion about risk. Depending on the importance of these
factors, either liability or regulation could turn out to be

preferred when they are considered as alternative methods
for the control of risk, but (as will be

stressed)

it

will

often be socially advantageous for the two methods to be
jointly employed.

basic model. The analysis of these points in the basic
model will proceed as follows. It will first be asked how
use of liability alone would function to reduce accident
risks, supposing that parties have perfect knowledge of the
risks they create but that their incentives to take care

could be diluted for two reasons: their assets might not be
sufficient to pay fully for harm done (meaning that they
would not bear the full social cost of their actions); or

they might not be sued for harm done. (These two causes of
dilution of incentives are not unimportant:' it is frequently the case that a party's potential for doing harm is
great in relation to its assets, even if the party is a
large firm; and in some contexts, notably in regard to
health-related and environmental risks, a party might not be
sued for harm done because the harm might be difficult to
trace to its source or because the harm might be highly

dispersed.) Thus, it will indeed be the case that parties
will choose to take less than the first-best levels of care;

the risks they
create, their levels of care will still generally bear a
positive relation to the risks.
but

because they recognize the magnitude

of

—3—

In the next section, it will be asked how use of regula-

tion alone would work to control accident risks, presuming
that parties must adhere to a regulatory standard of care as

a precondition for engaging in their activities.2 Further,
this standard will be a uniform one, owing to an assumption
that the regulator does not know parties' circumstances on
an individual basis and therefore cannot modify the standard

in view of them. Hence, the care parties take will not
reflect the particular risks that they create; and under the
(optimal) standard, parties presenting less than the average

risk will have been forced to take more than their first-best
levels of care, and those presenting more than the average
risk will have been allowed to take less than their first—
best levels of care.

The use of liability and regulation will then be considered as alternatives, and the comparison will depend on the

factors just discussed: on the "informational" advantage of
liability over regulation --

that

decisions about care are

made by those (the parties) possessing the better information
about risk -- and on the relative disadvantage of liability --

that

the factors which dilute incentives under liability are

of no import where behavior is directly controlled.3
After making this comparison, it will be asked how
joint use of liability and regulation would affect accident
risks, where by joint use is meant that parties must satisfy
the regulatory standard and will in addition be liable for

harm done. Here it will be shown under a general condition

-4-

that many parties ——
low risks --

will

those creating other than relatively

be led to do more than to satisfy the

regulatory standard, for their potential liability will make

that. worth their while. And at the same time, just because
such parties will take more care than is required, it will
be socially desirable for the regulatory standard to be
lower than if regulation were used alone; a reduction of the

standard can in effectbe afforded because liability is
present to take up some of the "slack" associated with the

lower standard. (Or at least liability can take up some of
this slack if the incentive to take care is not too much
diluted, which is the noted general condition.)

Last, joint use of liability and regulation will be
compared to use alone of either of the two methods for the
control of risk; and here under the general condition joint
use will be best for the reasons just discussed; otherwise,
however, joint use will offer no advantage.

extension of the model. An extension of the basic
model will then be considered in which the regulator but not
the parties know the value of a parameter that determines
risk4 (along with parties' circumstances, which the regula-

tor is still assumed to be unable to observe). This will
raise the possibility that regulation can be used to correct
for the systematically low level of care that would otherwise result if parties underestimated the parameter of risk.

example that illustrates the results of the analysis will be

presented, and following this, concluding comments will be
made concerning the interpretation of the analysis and the
importance of a factor that was omitted from it.

II. Basic Model

A.

Description of model. Risk neutral parties may

reduce the probability of causing harm by making expenditures

on care, and the magnitude of the harm they might do will

depend on their circumstances. Specifically, define
x

=

p(x) =

h

level

of care; x

0;

probability

of causing an accident; 0
p'(x) < 0; p''(x) > 0; and

= magnitude of harm

if

p(x) <

1;

an accident occurs,

where ii differs among parties, each of whom knows his own Ii.

The regulator, however, is aware only of the distribution of

h, and let
1(h) =

probability

density of h; f(h) > 0 on and only
on [a,b], 0 < a < b.

Assume that the social welfare criterion is minimization of
the expected sum

of

the costs of care and of harm done.

Thus, the first-best level of care as a function of a party'B

h is determined by minimizing over x

(2) 1 =

which of course has the interpretation that the marginal
cost of care, 1, equals the marginal benefits in terms

of

the expected reduction in harm, -p'(x)h. Denote by x*(h)
the first—best level of care and observe that it is increasing in h.6

B.

Liability as the sole means of controlling risk.

Assume that a party's potential for doing harm might exceed
his assets; and assume also that the probability of being
sued for harm
y =
q =

done might be less than 1. Thus, define

party's assets, a non-negative
probability of suit given that

q

harm has been

1,

where y and g are the same for each party. Now if a party
causes harm h and is sued, he will be liable for h,7 but pay
that amount only if Ii

y. Hence, his problem is to choose

his level of care x to minimize
(3) x +

p(x)qmin{h,y},

and let the solution to this be denoted

xL(h) =
Then we have

care

selected by a party given h.

-.7-.

Proposition 1. Under liability, the care taken by
parties as a function of the risk they present is

(4) xt(h) =

x*(qmin(h,y})
<

x*(h) ifq=landhy
x(h) otherwise;

That is, unless the probability of suit is 1 and assets are
sufficient to pay for harm, the incentive to take care will
be diluted, and the level of care will be less than first-best,

but it will increase with the magnitude of the risk so long
as this is less than the level of assets.

Note. Graphs of x2 and x (for a g < 1) are shown in
Fig. 1.

Proof. Since the right-hand side of (3) is identical
in form to (1), it is clear that x(h) is determined by the
first equality in (4). The inequality in (4) follows since
(as observed above) x is increasing in its argument and
since qmin(h,y) <

Regulation as the sole means of controlling risk.

Because the regulator cannot observe h, the standard he sets

Proposition 3. Use of regulation will be superior to
use of liability if the factors that dilute the incentive to
take care under liability are sufficiently important (g or y
sufficiently low) or if the variability in different parties'

circumstances is sufficiently small (h sufficiently concentrated about E(h)); otherwise liability will be superior
to regulation.

if the probability mass of h is sufficiently concentrated
about E(h), the regulation is superior to liability. To see
why these claims should be true, consider Fig. 3, which
shows that regulation will be superior to liability in a

region R about E(h) if x lies below x. Now it is clear
from

the

falls, the region R grows; and it is also clear that as the
probability mass becomes more concentrated about E(h), the
likelihood of being in region R increases; thus the validity
of the claims is evident.

Proof. If q or y equals 0, then (4) implies that x2(h)
is identically equal to 0, and thus the situation is as if
S

= 0.

But since S is the (unique) optimal s and is positive,

social costs must be lower under regulation than when q or y

equals 0. This fact and continuity of social costs in q
imples that for any y, regulation is superior to liability

for all q sufficiently small. Moreover, if liability is
superior to regulation for some q1, then the same must be
true for any q2 >

q1; for social costs are easily shown to

be decreasing in q under liability but are unaffected by q

under regulation. The first claim therefore follows. The
second claim is established similarly. Regarding the other
claim, note from (4) that if q < 1 or y <
<

x(E(h)),

but the latter equals 5*•

E(h), then x(E(h))

Bence, by continuity,

there must exist a non-degenerate interval including E(h) in
which s* +

p(s*)h

<

x(h)

+

p(x)h.

Thus, if enough pro-

bability mass is within this interval, (7) will be positive,

and regulation will be superior to liability. Q.E.D.

Joint use of regulation and liability. Assume now

that parties must satisfy a regulatory standard and are also

subject to liability. Then their levels of care will be
given by max{s,x2(h)), and the situation will be as shown in

On the other hand, for an s such as

Proposition 4. Under optimal joint use of regulation
and liability, there are two possible types of outcome in
situations where the incentive to take care is diluted (q
1, y <

b):1°

(a) The optimal regulatory standard is less than the
optimal standard were regulation used alone, but it exceeds
the

first-best level of care for those parties posing the

least risk; that is,
(9) x*(a) < s**

<

S*;

furthermore, some parties are induced by liability to take

more care than the required standard s**. A sufficient
condition for this case to hold is

—12—

(10) x2(b) >

or,

5*,

equivalently, that the incentive to take care is not too

diluted (q sufficiently close to 1, y to b).

(b) Or, the optimal regulatory standard equals the optimal standard where regulation alone was employed; that is,

(11) **

additionally,

= 5*;
no party is induced by liability to take more

care than s. This case will obtain if x(b) is sufficiently
low, or, equivalently, if the incentive to take care is
sufficiently diluted (q or y suffiently low).

However, in situtations where the incentive to take
care is complete (q =
(C)

1, y b), then of course

the optimal regulatory standard is o)1

Notes.

(a) To explain this result and why s may be

less than s* (perhaps the typical case), consider Fig. 5a
and the condition (10), which it is clear means that some
parties are induced by liability to take more care than s*.

Now the reason that this condition implies that s <

5* is

essentially that when regulation alone was used, reducing
the standard below s* was not worthwhile because it resulted
in all parties taking less care than 5*;
only in those parties with h <

h(s*)

but

here it results

taking less care ——

for

parties with higher h are induced by liability to take more

care than s*. Thus we said in the introduction that liability could take up some of the slack resulting from lowering the regulatory standard below s*.

—13—

On the other hand, to understand why s > x*(a),
observe that raising the standard from the level x*(a) would
not lead to any first-order change in expected social costs
in respect to parties with h = a but would result in a
first-order reduction in expected social costs in respect to
all other parties with higher h who would not have been
induced by liability to take as much care as x*(a).
In addition, note from the proof that in the present

case, s* is determined by the condition

(12) 1 =

h(s)

h(s)

a

a

—p'(s)[fhf(h)dh/ff(h)dh],

the interpretation of which is that the marginal cost of
care equals the expected reduction in harm,

where

the ex-

pectation is over only those parties who are not affected by
liability and thus are affected by the regulatory standard.12

(b) It is evident from Fig. 5b why this case arises

when z(b) is sufficiently low: for then the incentive to
take care created by liability is too weak to take up any of
the slack due to lowering the standard below $*; it is therefore best to leave the standard at s*.

(c) It is obvious that s should equal 0 in this
case, since liability will induce each party to choose the
first-best level of care.

Proposition 5. Any of the three methods for the
control of risk could turn out to be best:

(a) If the incentive to take care is sufficiently
diluted (q or y sufficiently low), use of regulation alone
is optimal; joint use of regulation and liability offers no
advantage.

(b) Otherwise, if the incentive to take care is diluted
(q <

1,

y <

b),

joint use of regulation and liability is

optimal.
(C)

If the incentive to take care under liability is

complete (q = 1, y

b), use of liability alone is optimal.

Notes.(a) More precisely, the assertion is that if q or

y is low enough that under joint use, s =

s*,

then use of

regulation alone is equivalent to joint use of regulation

and liability and is superior to use of liability alone. To

explain this, recall from Proposition 4 that if s
then under joint use no party does more than take care of

s Thus the outcome is what it is under regulation alone.

And the outcome is different from, and therefore superior
to, the outcome under liability alone (since x(a) <

Thus we know from Proposition 4 that x*(a) <

bility alone (since x1(a) ( **) and from that under reg-

ulation alone (since s < s*), and hence is superior to the
outcomes under each.

(C) If q = ]. and y

first—best outcome is achieved, so the result is obvious.

just given in the Notes.

III. Extension of the model

Assume now that parties do not possess perfect information

possess

about risk; rather, they and the

partial

regulator each

information of which the other is ignorant.

Specifically, assume that the magnitude of harm should an

accident occur is the um of two elements: a random component depending on a party's particular circumstances and
known by him but not by the regulator; and a parameter

common

to all parties but known only by the regulator. That

is,

Also, let

let

probability

g(h2) =

[c,dJ, 0 <

density of h2; g(h2) > 0 on and only on

c

<

d,

and assume that the parties know the functon g. Note that
given these definitions, the first—best level of care is
still determined by minimizing (1), and thus by (2).

We will now reconsider what was done in the basic

model. (In the interest of brevity, we will sometimes only
sketch the results, as they (and their proofs) will be
analogous to the previous ones.)

Under use of liability alone, the party's problem is to
choose his level of care x to minimize

where it s'ould be observed that the expectation here is over
since .he party does not observe h2 but does know h1.

Let x2(h1) denote the solution to (14). Thus the care taken
by a party under liability is

(15) x2(h1) =

x*(qE(min{h1

+

h2,y))).

It is clear from (15) that, similar to before, if q < 1 or
if y c ii (with positive probability), then the incentive to

take care will be diluted in the sense that x2(h1) (

E(h2)).

But unlike before, there is the additional element

of parties' misperception of risk: If a party underestimates risk, that is, if E(h2) <

h,

then the effect of

dilution of incentives will be accentuated, and the gap
between the party's care and first-best care will be made
larger; whereas if the party overestimates risk, if E(h2) >

h2, then the effect of dilution of incentives will be offset.
This is illustrated in Fig. 6, where the graph of x arid

the optimal regulatory standard given h2, then it is evident

that

(17) s*(h) = x*(E(h1)

h2).

Thus, as before, parties presenting less (more) risk
than the average take more (less) care than is first-best;

but

now the standard depends on the information that the

regulator alone possesses; it is higher the higher is h2, as
is indicated in Fig. 6.

and it can be shown

as

before that for given h2, regulation

will be superior to liability if q or y is sufficiently low
or if h1 is sufficiently concentrated about its mean; other-

wise liability will be superior. Now, however, the
comparison also depends on h2; in particular, regulation
will be superior to liability if h2 is much larger than

parties estimate, as is illustrated in the upper graph in
Fig. 6.

and using this, the analog to Proposition 4 can be established:

The optimal solution to (19), s**(h2), may be less than
s*(h2) (the optimal solution under regulation alone), in
which case some parties will take more care than

Or, s**(h2) may equal s*(h2), in which case no

party will take more care than s**(h2). On the other hand,
unlike in Proposition 4, h2 affects

For example, in

Fig. 7a it is illustrated that if h2 is sufficiently higher
than parties' estimate of E(h2), then s**(h2) =

s*(h2);

in

Figs. 7b and 7c, it is shown that s**(h2) declines as h2 declines; and in Fig. 7d, it is shown that if h2 is sufficiently
lower than E(h2), then s**(h2) =

Last, comparing joint use of regulation and liability
with use of either alone, then as before, any of the three

alternatives could be best. Very briefly, and as can be

was the case in Fig. 7d, where h2 was much less than E(h2).)

IV. Numerical example

Let us now present a numerical example illustrating the
results of the basic model and then of its extension.

example of the basic model. According to the example,
the probability of an accident as a function of expenditures
on care is p(x) =

the

harm that a party would cause

if an accident occurred is known

is

only

by him; and this harm

equally likely to be any thousand dollar amount between

$10,000 and $100,000 (that is, there are equal numbers of
parties who would cause $10,000 of harm, $11,000 of harm,
and so forth).

First-best expenditures on care16 for the example are
shown

in

the upper graph of Fig. 8; and the expenditures

that would be taken under liability alone17 are shown in the
lower graphs for three different combinations of asset

levels and probabilities of suit: $80,000 and 90%; $70,000
and 65%; and $60,000 and 50%. Note that the first of these
graphs becomes equal to a constant beyond $80,000 of harm,
for if a party's assets are $80,000, the prospect of doing
harm in excess of that amount will not cause him to take any
more care than he would if the harm were limited to $80,000;
and similarly the other two graphs become constant beyond

$70,000 and $60,000 respectively. Note in addition that
these graphs are ordered in the expected way: as there is
the least dilution of incentives when assets are $80,000 and
the probability of suit is 90%, the associated graph of care
is the highest among the three, and as there is the most
dilution when assets are $60,000 and the probability is 50%,
the associated graph of care is the lowest.

Also illustrated in Fig. 8 is the optimal standard of

care (s*) if regulation alone is employed. This standard
equals $86.12;18 if the standard is used, all parties who

would cause less than $55,000 of harm in an accident will
have been required to spend more on care than is first-best,
and all those who would cause more than $55,000 of harm will
have been allowed to spend less on care than is first—best.

Comparing the use of the $86.12 regulatory standard to
the use of liability alone, it turns out that use of liability is superior in the cases where assets and the probability of suit are $80,000 and 90%, and $70,000 and 65%;

but use of the standard is superior in the case where assets

—22—

and the probability of suit are $60,000 and 50%, owing to
there being the greatest dilution of incentives in that case
were liability employed.
Finally, the optimal standards of care (s**) assunhing

that regulation and liability are jointly employed are

indicated in the Figure. In the case where parties' assets
are $80,000 and the probability of suit is 90%, the optimal

standard is $70; thus only a few parties (those who would
cause less than about $13,000 of harm) are actually affected
by- the standard; the rest spend more than $70 on care due to

their potential liability; the optimal standard of care is

as low as it is for this very reason. Where parties' assets
$70,000 and the probability of suit is 65%, the optimal

standard of care is $76; now more parties are affected by
the standard (all those who would cause less than about
$31,000 of harm); the standard is higher than in the last
case because the dilution of incentives to take care due to

liability was lesser in that case. And where parties'
assets are only $60,000 and the probability of suit is 50%,
the optimal standard of care is $86.12 —-

the

optimal standard

if regulation alone is employed —— and all parties are

affected by the standard. Therefore, and unlike in the
other two cases, in this last case use of regulation alone
is optimal; joint use of regulation and liability offers no
advantage.

example of the extension of the model. Modify the
example of the basic model by assuming that the harm that

—23—

parties would cause in the event of an accident is the sum

of two elements: an amount known only by them and eqially
likely to be any thousand dollar amount between $0

$90,000;

and

and a parameter known only by the regulator and

equally likely to be $0, $10,000 or $20,000.

Graphs of the first-best levels of care as a function
of the component of the potential harm observed by the

parties are shown in Fig. 9 for each of the three different
levels of the parameter known to the regulator;19 thus the
graph where the parameter is $20,000 is the highest and that
where the parameter is $0 is the lowest of the three.

Also shown in Fig. 9 is the graph of care that would
be taken under liability alone if parties assets are $80,000

and the probability of suit is 90%.20 This graph is, of
course, unaffected by the actual level of the parameter

because it is known only to the regulator. The graph is
somewhat below the first-best graph when the parameter is
$10,000, which is parties' estimate of the parameter, due to
the dilution of incentives under liability; the graph is
much below the first best graph when the parameter is $20,000,

for here the true risk is greater than parties estimate; and
the graph is above the first-best graph (except over a small
region) when the parameter is $0, as in this case the true
risk is less than parties estimate.2'

The optimal standard of care if regulation is used
alone is shown in the Figure for each level of the parameter.

The optimal standard rises as the parameter rises:22 it is
$84.12 when the parameter is $0, $86.12 when the parameter

is $10,000, and $87.80 when the parameter is $20,000. Use
of these regulatory standards, however, turns out to be
inferior to use of liability alone.

Last, the optimal standards of care if regulation and
liability are used together are shown

in

the Figure. The

optimal standard is $70 if the parameter equals $10,000
(note that $70 is less than the $86.12 standard were reg-

ulation alone employed); and the optimal standard is $81 if
the parameter is $20,000 (and note that $81 is less than the

$87.80 standard). In these two cases, joint use of regulation
and liability is superior to use of regulation or of liability

alone. But in the case where the parameter is $0, the
optimal standard is $0, and it is not desirable to use
regulation in addition to liability; the reason is that

under liability alone, parties take more than enough care
given the true, low risk.

V.

Concluding Comments

Let us conclude with a brief consideration of the
interpretation of the analysis and with a remark on a factor
of importance that was omitted from it, namely, the magnitude
of administrative costs.

—25—

(a) The choices that society evidently has made over
use of liability and regulation may be identified, it is
tentatively suggested, with the theoretically desirable

choices of the model. That is, taking into account, on the
one hand, the informational advantage (or lack thereof) of
the private parties and, on the other hand, the possible
sources of dilution of incentives to reduce risk, one can
see a kind of rationality in the balance that has been
struck between use of the two ways of controlling risk.23
Consider first the area where society has placed chief
reliance on liability as the legal means of controlling
risk; consider, in other words, the familiar categories of
accident coming under the rubric of tort (for example, I chop
down a tree in my backyard and it strikes my neighbor's garage;

I run for a bus and collide with someone). Here it does seem
that as a general matter, the knowledge possessed by private

parties about the particular dangers they create and

the

costs of meliorating them is significantly better than what

would be enjoyed by a regulatory authority. (How much would
such an authority know about the chance of this particular

tree in my particular backyard damaging that particular

neighbor's garage?) It also seems that the possibility that
parties would not be able to pay fully for harm done does
not represent a problem of great dimension (at least by
comparison to the situation that often obtains in areas of

regulation).24 Similarly, it seems that a chance that
parties will not face the threat of suit does not constitute

—26—

a substantial problem; for the usual tort, the harm done

will not be difficult to attribute to the party who caused
it (there will be no mystery about the source of the damage
to my neighbor's garage or of the injury suffered by the

person at the bus stop), nor will other reasons why suit
might not be brought be of noticeable importance.25
The situation appears different, however, in areas

where use of regulation is siguificant. In such areas, the
information that is necessary to justify regulation is sometimes virtually common knowledge (driving at high speed in a

school zone or transporting explosives through tunnels
obviously presents unacceptable risks) or at least it is
fairly easy to obtain (appropriate procedures for pasteuri-

zation of milk); and where this is not true, the information
is often of a special and technical nature that may be

better appreciated by the regulatory authority. The latter
seems at least plausible in regard to many of the environmental and health-related risks that are today increasingly
subject to regulation, for expert medical, epidemiological,

or ecological knowledge may be needed for their proper

assessment. (Nevertheless, it is certainly not claimed that
the informational advantage of the parties is uniformly
small or nonexistent in regulated areas.)

Secondly, the risks in regulated areas can often readily
be imagined to exceed the assets of responsible parties
(hotel fires, the collapse of dams, and explosions, for
example, can clearly result in losses surpassing the assets
of the individuals or firms that cause them); thus the

—27-

incentives to reduce risk that are provided by liability

alone may be seriously inadequate. This factor may be of
particular importance again in respect to some of the healthrelated and environmental risks, as they may cause losses of

extreme magnitude. (Consider the potential for harm associated with nuclear accidents, widespread exposure to carcinogens such as asbestos, mass use of drugs with harmful

side-effects.) Furthermore, and still again in regard to
many of the health-related and environmental risks, the
incentives created by liability may be significantly diminished by the possibility that firms would not be sued for
harm done; for such risks frequently result in harm that is
difficult to trace to its source (was the individuals's lung
cancer due to conditions at his workplace, to medical x-radiation, or to "natural" causes?) or that occurs only after
the passage of a long period of time; additionally, in some
instances the harm is so dispersed that no single injured
party would find legal action worthwhile.26
The hypothesis that the actual use of regulation and
liability is consistent with their desirable use in theory
is given further support by the fact that many if not most
risky activities are subject to both regulation and liability,

and that according to general legal principle, satisfaction
of regulatory requirements does not render parties immune
from liability;27 additionally, regulatory requirements seem

to be regarded as minimal. These qualitative characteristics
of the joint use of regulation and liability are, recall,

-28-

those derived in the analysis, where it was shown

that

it

might well be advantageous to employ both means of controlling
risk and to adopt a "low" regulatory standard (one less than
the standard were regulation used alone) because the incentives created by liability would lead most parties to take a

higher and tolerably good level of care given their circumstances 28

The hypothesis of consistency of theory with fact

should not of course be over interpreted. As stated at the
outset, the consistency is thought to exist only in a very
approximate sense, for the choices actually made concerning
regulation and liability are undoubtedly influenced by a
multitude of factors going beyond those of the analysis --

notably,

the pressures of interest groups29 -- and in any

event often will not be the result of a conscious and ex-

plicit use of a social cost-benefit calculus. It is therefore hardly surprising sometimes to hear assertions that
regulation is onerous or other times that it is lax.

(b)

The principal normative implication of the analysis

is, obviously, that in assessing how much to regulate and
how much to rely on liability to control risk, careful
attention should be paid to the locus of information about
risk and to the importance of the factors that dilute the
incentive to take care under liability.

(c) Regarding the omitted issue of administrative
costs, the main point to be made is that there seems to be
an underlying advantage in favor of liability due to its

-29—

being employed, by its nature, only if harm is done, whereas
adherence to regulation is determined, and the associated
administrative costs are borne, before, or at least independent of, the actual occurrence of harm. (Consider the
extreme case where taking appropriate care completely eli-

minates the possibility of harm. Here there would be no
administrative costs whatever under liability --

for

if

parties were induced to take appropriate care, there would
never be an occasion for its use --

but

the costs of reg-

ulation would be positive.30) A fuller analysis of liability
and regulation would recognize this apparent advantage of
liability.

Appendix

Proof of Proposition 4. The argument consists of a series of
steps, the first four of which establish (a) and the last
three of which show (b).

(i) ** must lie in [x*(a),s*]: It is very easy to
verify that for every h, expected social costs are lower at
s =

x*(a) than at smaller s, so tht s x*(a).
To demonstrate that s s, let C(s;r) be expected

social costs given s when regulation alone is employed, and
let C(s;rl) be expected social costs when regulation and

liability are jointly employed. Then for any s <

2'

we

claim that
(Al) C(s1;r) —

C(s2;r)

C(s1;rl) —

C(s2;rl).

This can be demonstrated by showing that the corresponding
weak inequality in social costs holds for every h; that is,
(A2)

p(s1)h)

—

+ p(s2)h]

[max(s11x(h)) + p(max(s1, x2(hfl)h]
[max(s2,x(h)) + p(max{s2, x(h)J)h].
To verify (A2), consider Fig. 10, which shows in the regions
A, B, and C the different possible relations that may hold

among s, 2 and x2(h). It is clear that for h in the
region A, equality obtains, for the parties will act identically under regulation alone and under joint use of regula-

tion and liability. For h in region B, (A2) will be strict:
under regulation alone parties will increase care from s1 to

under joint use of regulation and liability, they will

increase care only from x(h) to

x2(h) + p(x(h))h; but the latter inequality holds

p(s1)h

strictly since expected social costs are convex in care and

< x(h) < x *(h). For h in region C, (A2) will also be
strict: under regulation alone parties will increase care

since expected social costs are convex in

but under joint use of regulation and liabil-

ity, care will remain at the level xt(h), and costs will
consequently be unchanged.

Having established (A2) and therefore (Al), suppose

that s > s Then since s* minimizes C(s;rl) over s, we
know in particular that C(s*;rl) then implies that C(s*;r) —

second term in braces in (8') is relevant. Now since this

term has a unique minimum over all s at s and

s* > s, the

term must have a unique minimum over s s at s*. But
this means that the term cannot have had a minimum at s,
which is a contradiction.

—32—

(iii) Jf ** < s, then

is determined by the

first-order condition (12) and s > x*(a): From (ii), we
know that if s** 5* then the first term in braces in (8')
is relevant for all s in an interval properly including

with respect to s of the term must be zero. But the derivative is

Now the first term of (A3') is positive, since we know from

(i) that s x*(a), since h(x*(a)) > a,3 and since h( )

is

increasing in its argument. Thus, if (A3') equals zero,

its second term must equal zero, which is (12).

To demonstrate that s > x*(a), we need only show that
(A3') is unequal to zero, and in fact negative, when eva-

luated at x*(a). (This will prove the result since by the

last paragraph it will mean that s is unequal to x*(a),

and by (i), s' x*(a).) Observe first that since h(x*(a))
> a, the first term in (A3') is positive. Notice second
that

(A4)

h(s)
h(s)

—33—

is the mean of h conditional on its being in the interval

[a,h(s)]. The reader can easily verify that this tends to a
as h(s) tends to a and is stricity increasing in h(s).

Thus, since h(x*(a)) > a, (A4) must exceed a at s

x*(a).

And it follows from this and the fact that 1 + p(x*(a))a
0 that the second term in braces in (A3') is negative when
evaluated at x*(a).

(iv) If (10) holds, then s** < *: Suppose otherwise.

Then by (1) s =

s.

But since (10) implies that the first

expression in braces in (B') is relevant at s, we need only
show that (A3') is positive at s to contradict the opti-

mality of s. To do this, note from (6) and (2) that

(A5) 1 + p?(s*)fhf(h)dh = 0.

However, since (A4) is strictly less than fhf(h)dh when
a
evaluated at s*, it follows that the second term in braces

in (A3') is positive at s*. And since the first term in
(A3') is clearly positive at s*, (A3') must be postive.

We remark also that it is obvious that (10) will hold
if g and y are sufficiently high, for as q approaches 1 and

y approaches b, x(b) approaches x*(b) > 5*

(v) If ** = s*, then no party chooses care exceeding

case x(b) s. Our claim therefore follows.

An earlier version of present paper is contained in my
"Harm as a Prerequisite for Liability", Harvard University,

1979, and an elaborated, non-technical version of the present
paper is presented in Shavell (1984).

1.

See the brief discussion in the concluding comments.

2.

It will be clear that the analysis would not be

changed in an essential way were the possibility considered
that enforcement of the regulatory standard was not perfect
or was probabilistic —- and thus that some parties might be

able to engage in their activities without adhering to the
regulatory standard.

3.

This comparison of liability and regulation may be

contrasted with the comparison made in the interesting and
well known paper of Martin Weitzman (1974) by considering

the problem of pollution damage. In respect to this problem,
Weitzman compared regulation of the amount of pollution to

use of a pollution tax and he emphasized that there is no
natural advantage of either: not only might a social authority

—36—

err in deciding on a regulatory standard owing to lack of
information about the costs and benefits of preventing
pollution, it might err also in setting a pollution tax, for
it would not generally be expected to know ahead of time the
amount of damage that would be done by pollution.

Here, on the other hand, it is not use of a pollution

tax that is compared to regulation, it is liability. The
siguificance of this difference is that whereas the pollu-

tion tax is imposed before harm occurs and therefore naturally
involves uncertainty as to its amount, liability is imposed
by its nature only when harm has occurred, arid therefore

presumably involves little (and in the model, no) uncertainty

over its amount. In other words, the problem here concerning
liability as an alternative to regulation does not involve
lack of information on the part of the social authority;

instead, as explained, it has to do with dilution of incentives.

4.

As will be seen, the assumption is really that not

only does the regulator alone "observe" the values of the
parameter, but also that the regulator does not communicate

its value to the parties. The justification for the asswnption is that sometimes information about risk cannot easily
be conveyed to parties because of its complexity or its
technical character.

5.

We assume that the (2) holds for the first-best x

for all h in [a,b), that is, that 1 < —p'(O)a.

—37—

6.

Differentiate (2) with respect to h to get 0 =

—p''(x)x'(h)h

—

p'(x),

so that x'(h) =

(since p'(x) ( 0 and p''(x) >

7.

—p'(x)/(p''(x)h)

>

0

0).

In saying here that a party is liable for harm

done, we are implicitly assuming that the form of liability

is strict. Were we to consider instead the negligence
rule -- under which a party would be liable only if his
level of care was inadequate, that is, less than x*(h) —-

the

qualitative character of the results to be obtained

would be essentially unaltered. For instance, referring to
the next Proposition, the incentive to take care would still
generally be diluted if q ( 1 or y <

h; it is only that

x2(h) would be determined by a slightly different equation.

(Actually, x(h) would equal x*(qmin{h,y)) unless q and

y

were sufficiently high, in which case it would equal x*(h).)

8.

Here h( )

denotes

the inverse of x( )

where

the

latter is rising; thus h(x1(h))) = h for h in [ay) if y < b
arid for all h in [a,b] otherwise.

9.

A solution to (8) and (8') exists since (8) is

continuous in s and

it will be shown in step Ci)

of

the

proof that s may be taken to lie in a closed and bounded
interval.

—38-

10. It would be tedious to consider formally here (and
later) the cases where
<

b.

<

1 and y

b or where g = 1 and y

But it will be obvious from the proof that in the

former case, (a) and (b) will still hold. And a slight
modification of the proof can be used to show that if q = 1

and y is sufficiently high, then s* 0 (the analogue to

(a)), and that otherwise s =

s.

11. Or, more precisely, s could equal any s
for use of such an s would not affect any party's behavior.

12. Condition (12) is really the analog of (6), as is
apparent when the latter is rewritten as 1 =

—p'(s)E(h).

13. Note that although in the figure the graph of x
lies below that of

when E(h2) >

h,

this need not be the

case (e.g., if h2 were less than but sufficiently close to

E(h2), then the graph of x would be above that of x2).

14. In (19) the function h1( ) denotes the inverse of
),

and thus is analogous to the function h( )

of

the

previous section (see note 8 above).

15. Equally, s**(h2) could equal any

s

xL(a), for

use of such an a would not affect any party's behavior.

model, as they concern parties' perception of risk.)

23.

This is the theme that is developed in Shavell

(1983).

24. It should be noted in this regard that widespread
ownership of liability insurance reduces the likelihood that
a party would be unable to pay for harm done (and although
it might also alter incentives to take care, this can be

argued not to provide an independent reason for regulation).

25. In terms of the model, this paragraph may be
summarized by saying that if we had to make a broad generalization concerning the area of the typical tort, it
would be that parties possess superior information, so that
the basic version of the model applies, and also that y and
g are both fairly high.

26. This paragraph may be summarized by saying that in
the areas where regulation is significant and the basic
model applies, the informational advantage of the parties
might not be great; that where the extension of the model
applies, the regulator may have an informational advantage
about an important aspect of risk; and that y or q may be
low.

-41-

27. See Prosser (1971), pp. 203-204; thus use of
regulation is indeed accompanied by use of liability.

30. In the case of the numerical example of the basic
model (Section III), the likelihood of an accident under

liability is on average about .0003. Thus, expected administrative costs under liability will be lower than those

under regulation unless the cost of determining adherence to
regulation is much smaller than the administrative cost of
the liability system (which should not be equated with the
costs of going to court, for the parties to disputes settle

far more often than not). For instance, suppose that the
administrative costs of the liability system is $200 per

accident. (If, say, 90% of disputes are settled at an
administrative cost of about $100 and 10% go to trial at an
administrative cost of $1000, the expected administrative
cost given that an accident has occurred would be approxi-

mately $200). Then the expected administrative costs
associated with use of liability would be only .0003x$200 =

$.18.

Hence the cost of determining adherence to regulation

would have to be less than this amount for regulation to

involve lower administrative costs. While this might seem

-42-

unlikely, it must be adniitted that significant savings in
adntinistratjve costs might be achievable through use of

probabilistic means of enforcement of regulation.

related issues.
