Institutional

Aspects of High Unemployment
in the Federal Republic of Germany

ABSTRACT
The sustained rise in German unemployment since 1973 poses a

problem of critical importance for the world economy. Fewer than
two decades ago, Germany boasted an average unemployment rate of
under 1% and imported labor to relieve chronic labor shortages. By

the mid-l980s, unemployment had risen to over 8 percent of the
labor force. This paper investigates some of the reasons for the

secular rise in unemployment. We find that while deficient

aggregate demand can probably explain some of the current
joblessness, the secular rise in unemployment has consisted
primarily of an increase in the equilibrium rate of unemployment.

We also find little evidence that this increase is due to changes
in frictional unemployment. Rather, after reviewing institutional

details of the labor market in Germany, we identify various
impediments to the kinds of structural adjustments that have

operated to maintain a fairly constant equilibrium rate of
unemployment in the United States.

The sustained rise in German unemployment since 1973 poses a

problem of critical importance for the world economy. Fewer than
two decades ago, this country boasted an average unemployment rate
of under 1% and imported labor to relieve chronic labor shortages.

By the mid-1980s, unemployment had risen to between 8 and 9
percent of the labor force- - levels not observed since the early

years of the Marshall Plan. These developments are even more
striking when compared with the United States, where average
unemployment rates have been higher but have also recovered from

the last two recessions (see Table 1). Furthermore, much of the

secular increase in West German unemployment took place during
periods of relatively high economic growth.

This paper investigates some of the reasons for the secular

rise in West German unemployment. We find that while deficient

aggregate demand can certainly explain some of the current
joblessness in the country, the secular rise in unemployment has

consisted primarily of an increase in the equilibrium rate of
unemployment. We find little evidence that this increase is due to

changes in so-called "frictional" unemployment, such as increased

job search due to lower costs of search or an increase in the
variance of economic shocks impinging on the economy. Rather, we

find more convincing evidence of institutional forces impeding
labor market adjustments, most importantly, the inability of labor

markets to adjust and reallocate labor through wage changes. For

example, it is widely recognized that large adverse shocks to

manufacturing labor demand in the 1970s occurred in most of the

industrial economies. In the United States, these shocks were
mediated in part by falling manufacturing sector wages (especially

in nonunion firms) and by an expansion of employment in the
lower-wage service (or tertiary) sectors. After reviewing the
institutional detail of labor markets in the Federal Republic of

Germany, we find strong evidence of impediments to the kinds of
structural adjustments that have taken place in the US over the
past fifteen years.

We begin our analysis in Section 3 by considering the
response of a two sector economy that sustains an adverse shock to

its manufacturing sector, in the presence of a lower-wage service

sector. Following the literature, we presume that wages in the
manufacturing sector are set by unions, introducing some degree of

real wage ridigity. We assume alternatively that the low wage
service sector is characterized by market clearing, or by rigid
wages as in manufacturing. The rigid wages in the service sector

may be due to the presence of unions, to legal restrictions on
wage reductions, or to an effective floor on wages determinined by
the level of unemployment benefits.

We then

present evidence that the US is more like the

economy characterized by labor market clearing in services,
whereas the Federal Republic of Germany resembles more nearly the

case of rigid wages. This is most obviously reflected in the
absolute and relative growth of the service-producing sectors in

the two countries. An increase in the extent of wage dispersion
across the sectors, which is predicted for the first economy, only

2

obtains in the US. Additionally, labor productivity in the service

sectors has grown at considerably lower rates in the US, as would

be expected with rigid wages in services in Germany and flexible

wages in services in the US. The differential productivity
performance is mirrored (as predicted by the model) by the
differing paths of capital-labor ratios in the service sectors of
the two economies.

While we cannot make an exact apportionment of the reasons
for non market-clearing in West German service sectors, we suspect

that two primary factors block a US-style expansion of the
tertiary industries in West Germany. First, the remarkable growth

of unionism in the service branches in Germany has resulted in
significantly better wage outcomes than in the corresponding US

sectors. Furthermore, institutions peculiar to West Germany
increase the impact of collective bargaining agreements on costs:

union agreements are implicitly or explicitly extended to cover
nonunion workers, and increasingly in those sectors that would be

expected to absorb redundant labor released by the production
sectors. Second, there is evidence that the unemployment insurance

system may preclude wage reduction in the West German service

sector, since compensation in these sectors would often be
dominated by unemployment benefits as has been argued by Minford
(1985).

1. fl Rise j the NAIRU j

Federal Republic .f Germany

The recent experience in Western Europe and West Germany in
particular pose a serious challenge to the conventional "natural

3

rate of unemployment" (or "non-accelerating inflation rate of

unemployment," the NAIRU) paradigm first proposed by Milton
Friedman (1968), which is widely considered an important point of

agreement among macroeconomists. Since

the natural rate of

unemployment is normally regarded as relatively stable

and

determined by factors that evolve only slowly over time, advocates

of the typical natural rate view must view the rise in European

unemployment as the outcome of "depression" conditions induced
by sharp declines in aggregate demand,

in conjunction with the

presence of nominal rigidities or expectational error. Several
arguments, however, suggest that this view is incorrect; rather,
the secular rise in unemployment rates in the Federal Republic of

Germany has largely represented movements in the natural rate
itself.

This conclusion is generally supported by analysts who have

attempted to estimate the West German NAIRU directly. Layard

(1984) report an increase of the natural rate in Germany
from 1.3%

in the late l960s to 6.2% over 1981-1983; Coe and

Gagliardi (1985) find an increase from 0.9 to 8.0%; Franz (1985)
estimates a NAIRIJ as high as 8.9% if obsolescence effects of the

capital stock are included. In contrast, estimates of the
equilibrium unemployment rate in the US has remained fairly stable

over the past decade, increasing by no more than 2% between the
late l960s and the early 1980s (Coe and Gagliardi 1985).

Using two different techniques, we estimated the path of the
NAIRU in the US and West Germany over the past twenty-five years.

The first simply uses estimates of the barebones "accelerationist

4

equation," which relates the rate of acceleration of the price
level to the deviation of current unemployment from the NAIRU,

with the latter proxied by a constant plus a fourth order
polynomial in time. Specifically, we use OLS to estimate

is the rate of change in the

this

equation may be derived from

an

expectations-augmented Phillips curve relation. An estimate of the

NAIRU can be obtained each period by setting

where hats denote estimates.
As a more conservative alternative, we used a frequency
domain procedure that assumes that deviations of actual from
equilibrium unemployment only occur in the context of the business

cycle. Movements of unemployment at low frequencies represent
equilibrium movements, and at high frequencies, movements in the
cyclical unemployment rate. We first difference the standardized

unemployment rate series, decompose the data into its frequency
components via Fourier transform, and then mask all components at

periodicities of eight years or lower.

An inverse Fourier

transform was then applied to the data, which are then summed

from some base year, here 1960. The results of both procedures
using OECD standardized unemployment rates are displayed in Table

2.1
The results obtained by the two procedures are similar, and

support the results of other studies cited above. Whereas
unemployment in the United States has returned frequently to the

neighborhood of 6-7%, there

is strong evidence that the

equilibrium rate in the Federal Republic of Germany continues
to rise. Our NAIRU estimates for Germany, which range from 5.7 to

8.6%. in 1985, also suggest the existence of some "Keynesian"
unemployment that might be vitiated by a demand expansion (in that

the actual unemployment rate exceeds the NAIRU); nonetheless, in
both cases this represents a deviation around

secularly rising

equilibrium rate. Unless the paradigm of an "equilibrium rate"
is completely abandoned, deficient aggregate demand explanations

of European unemployment proposed by Tobin (1984) are

only

capable of explaining a fraction of the fifteen year secular
rise in West German unemployment.
Our assessment of the NAIRU is consistent with evidence on
capacity utilization rates, total capacity, and the evolution of

and conceptual problems. Sargent (1971) has correctly criticized
constraining the sum of weights on lagged inflation rates to unity
as a potentially suboptimal forecast. The first procedure ignores
simultaneous equations bias that arises if the inflation rate and
the unemployment rate are jointly determined. It is
also
inconsistent with strong forms of rational expectations; clearly,
if policies inducing a constantly increasing inflation rate over
the economy would not

operative.

countries in general have sustained a severe reduction of
productive capacity, and Burda (1987) has documented a large
cumulative reduction in the size of manufacturing capital stocks
relative to trend in these countries. As is evident from Table 3,

the aggregate capacity utilization

rate

in West German

manufacturing in 1986 is equal to its 1979 value, whereas US plant

utilization remains significantly below its previous peak. This
suggests that despite high unemployment rates in Germany,

firms

are operating at full capacity. Moreover, if we estimate equation

(1) and using a capacity utilization rate rather than the
unemployment rate, we find a stable relationship (insignificahce

of time shift variables) between German inflation and German
capacity utilization, instead of the unstable relationship bwtween
inflation and unemployment. The results presented in Table 4 imply

that unemployment rates in Germany, in contrast to capacity
utilization rates, contain relatively little information about the

overall state of unused resources in the economy. They also
suggest that firms have adjusted their long-run capacity to levels
consistent with a high equilibrium level of unemployment.

The wealth of macroeconomic evidence, however, provides
little support for job mismatch explanations of the rise in the

West German NAIRU. At the most cursory level, the shift in the

of the ith state, occupation, or industry. The mismatch measure
may be interpreted

as the percentage of workers who must

move, change occupations, or change industry to equalize the ratio

of unemployment to vacancies in groupings. Time profiles of
occupational (39 categories), regional (10 LAnder), and industrial

(10 sectors) mismatch are displayed in Table 5. Our results on

occupational mismatch are similar to those of Layard, et.al.
(1984) for the UK; we find a significant decline (roughly 50%) in

occupational mismatch over the period 1979-1984.

We do find a

significant increase in regional mismatch over the past decade.
This supports generally anecdotal evidence on regional immobility

contracts, and strong aversion to changing residence. For a
country not much larger than the state of Oregon, this may be
surprising; nonetheless, even if 20% of all unemployed Germans did

move to high-vacancy Lander,

they would still face an official

vacancy-unemployment ratio of nearly 1:25!

Clearly, these numbers should be considered with some
caution. First, unemployment data from West Germany are reported

unemployment only and neglect unemployed individuals not
registered at the local employment offices. Second, vacancy data
cannot capture all offers made, and many offers are made directly

to job seekers without assistance of the state-provided matching
services. Nonetheless, if the link between reported vacancies and

If

dismisses changes in worker preferences as the

primary cause of the rise in the natural rate of unemployment in
West Germany, the culprit must be an insufficient number of jobs
to employ the labor force normally willing to work at the current

constellation of factor prices. This suggests a malfunctioning of

the labor market, i.e., wages are not adjusting sufficiently to
equilibrate demand and supply of labor and are above their market

levels for some or all

sectors

in the Federal

Republic of Germany.

3. Th Non-Adjustment

Wages: Theory

It is widely recognized that the l970s were characterized by

a series of adverse shocks to the demand for labor in all
advanced industrialized countries: two oil price increases and
a still largely unexplained productivity slowdown. In Europe, this

was compounded by a well-documented increase in labor taxes. The

"wage-gap" literature has uncovered important linkages between
the post-shock performance of the Western industrial economies
and the response of their labor market institutions

(and real

the literature has

rediscovered the real wage-employment relationship in European

economies and a central role

for aggregate supply in the

12

evolution of European output and employment in the 1970s.4

What is the response of an economy to a decline in its terms

of trade, an adverse shift in total factor productivity, or some
other adverse shift to the demand for labor in its manufacturing

sector? Under such circumstances, the scope is limited for real

wage increases in manufacturing without negative effects on
employment, and the level of wages consistent with high employment

may actually decline. If, however, the manufacturing sector is
unionized, these wage reductions may not be forthcoming. It is
well-recognized that under a wide range of conditions, models of
monopoly union behavior imply a rigid real consumption wage, or at

least a rigid markup over the best alternative available in the
uncovered sector or the level of unemployment benefits.5 The union

may be willing to accept some unemployment among its members in

return for perserving a high real wage. Labor will be released
from the manufacturing sector.
Barring wage reductions in the sector that sustain the shock,

either through direct concessions or an increase in the fraction

of nonunionized employees in manufacturing, there will be a
contraction of manufacturing employment. Redundant labor will be

absorbed by the nonunion or uncovered sector, where wages will

and Symons (1985), Adams, Fenton, and Larsen (1986).

5The seminal articles are McDonald and Solow (1981) and Oswald
(1982); see also Bruno and Sachs (1985), chapter 9 and Oswald's
1985 survey article. In the benchmark case, if utility of the
representative member has constant relative risk aversion and the
elasticity of labor demand is constant, the optimal union wage is

a fixed markup over the non union alternative wage or the

sector, which is little unionized, is a likely place to absorb

mucht of the surplus labor. It is significant that all net US
employment growth has occurred in the service

sectors, where

trade unions are of negligible importance.6

We depict this two sector adjustment in the panels of Figure
3. Labor is homogenous and supplied inelastically by households in
quantity L, the length of the segment AB, which can be employed in

either sector. In the absence of market restrictions, a single
wage would clear the labor market. Suppose, however, that a union

sets wages in the manufacturing sector at Wm; consequently
employment in manufacturing is AC. Excess labor is absorbed by the
other sector, so employment in the tertiary sectors is BC, at wage

W. The response of this economy to a leftward shift of L is
displayed in the second panel of Figure 3. Employment in services
increases from BC to BD, manufacturing employment declines from AC

to AD and the service sector wage declines from W to W'.

In

practice in the US W itself is not fully rigid, especially due

to the presence of a non-union manufacturing sector, so that
adjustment takes place thorugh a reduction in Wm and

48% in US manufacturing and transport/communications/public
utilities, respectively, compared with 10% in trade, 4% in FIRE
(finance, insurance, and real estate), and 7% in other services.

the alternative wage available to union members, the decline in
the service sector wage may lead to a reduction of union wage

demands in manufacturing, even if there is no non-union
manufacturing subsector. This would reduce, but not wholly
eliminate, the reduction in manufacturing employment and the
decline in W

The labor markets in the Federal Republic of Germany will in

general adjust with less flexibility to labor demand shocks.
First, wages in the manufacturing (unionized) sector will likely
decline less to increased unemployment than in the US. Second, the

sectors considered uncovered in the US may also be unionized, or

may for institutional reasons be required to pay some minimum
wage. Third, even if these sectors are not unionized, unemployment

insurance or welfare assistance may set a floor on the extent to
which wages in these sectors can fall. These impediments prevent

sufficient adjustment of nonunion, nonmanufacturing wages to
absorb displaced workers.

Consider the panels of Figure 4, which depict the initial

equilibrium of such an economy and its response to an adverse

labor demand shift in manufacturing. In contrast to the
wage-adjusting economy, the economy in Figure 4 does not possess

an absorbing service sector. Instead, real wages are prevented
from adjusting, and there is an emergence of unemployment, given

by the segment CD in the first panel. In this economy, the
unemployment rate, rather than the relative wage differential,

responds to disturbances. When L1 shifts leftward to LD,,
unemployment increases from CD to ED. By assumption, relative
wages across the two sectors remain the same.

Even if there is no union in the other sector, the provision

of unemployment insurance (UI) can have a similar impact on the
response of an economy to a shock to its higher wage manufacturing

sector. A sufficiently high unemployment benefit for newly
unemployed workers released from the manufacturing sector could

introduce a lower bound on wages in the nonunionized service

sector. In one sense, this unemployment is voluntary, since
unemployed individuals are indifferent between working in the

service sector and collecting UI benefits; if there is some
probability of ultimate recall, their expected utility may be
higher in the latter state. On the other hand, actual positions
are never offered and would never appear in official vacancy data.

Our simple model contains several strong predictions. In an
economy with labor market clearing in services and a rigid wage in
manufacturing, one should expect service sector employment to rise

both absolutely and relative to manufacturing. In an economy with
restricted adjustment in services, service sector employment will
increase only in relative terms. The size of the service sector in
terms of value added will respond similarly. Second, wage rigidity
in manufacturing will imply an increase in nominal wage dispersion

in the economy with market clearing. This follows from the fact

that the uncovered sector wage must fall to clear the labor
market. In the second economy, unemployment rises, but relative
wage dispersion by assumption is unchanged. Third, service sector

labor productivity in the first economy should decline in tandem
with the service sector wage, as should the capital-labor ratio.

Capital intensity in services will be higher in the second

economy. In the next section, we

will show that both

institutional and labor market evidence strongly suggest that the

US is well-characterized by the market clearing version of the

model, while the Federal Republic of Germany is closer to the
rigid wage version.

4. Evidence for the Model

4.1. Institutional Evidence

An understanding of institutions is a sine aua

for

meaningful analysis of the evolution of wages and employment in
the Federal Republic of Germany, since the institutions are quite

different from their counterparts in the US. To begin with,
collective bargaining process in Germany is highly regularized and

place on an

legally circumscribed. Wage negotiations take

industry rather than craft level through seventeen national labor
unions

of

the

umbrella

organization,

the

Deutscher

Gewerkschaftsbuj-id (DGB), which at yearend 1985 had roughly

7,720,000 members. Representing the employer's side is a
collection of about 1000 "employer associations" organized as the

EDA (Bundesvereinigung der Deutschen Arbeitgeberverbande). While
agreements

are ultimately concluded at the

regional

and

sometimes at the plant level, the constituent national unions
publicize a wage demand at the outset of the annual bargaining
round that serves as a standard for subsequent negotiations.

Perhaps the most significant (and most frequently ignored)

feature of collective bargaining

in West

Germany

that

distinguishes it from the US is the possibility for wage
agreements

to be declared

"generally

binding"

for

all

employees and all enterprises in a sector, regardless of union

membership or whether the firm is a member of the employers'

Although

expressly forbidden by law, either side of a

wage contract can petition the state (Land) labor minister for

an extension of

the

contract ternis to all workers and

enterprises, as long as more than 50% of all workers in the
relevant sector are employed by firms that were a party to the
original agreement.

The extension of wage agreements is an important element of
the West German collective bargaining landscape. While in a given

year only 10% of all agreements are declared generally binding,

they are often nationwide contracts, representing about 20% of
all employees in recent years.9 Schatz (1984) argues that even
if

agreements are not declared generally binding, the high

membership

rates of employers in employers'

confederations

(80-90% in manufacturing) enforces the wage agreement as the de

facto minimum wage, since member emtloyers are legally bound k

generally little objection from management of existing firms. It

(Wage Contract Law) of 1969. For references see the OECD (1979)
and Boedler and Keiser (1979); Schatz (1984) and Soitwedel (1984)
have written on the economic effects of "extension."

9See Schatz (1984), p. 25. Moreover, the number of contracts
"extended" has risen rapidly, from 173 contracts in 1968, to 448
in 1975, to 563 in 1986.

Since union shop generally

applies, there are few free riders and organization levels closely

Significantly, collective bargaining and its "minimum wage"

characteristics extend to occupations and sectors which are
generally nonunion in the US. While blue collar membership in DGB

affiliated unions has remained constant over the past 15 years,

white collar union membership has risen by more than 35%

The

sectors. Although

its

membership of

370,000 (yearend 1985) represented only about 10% percent of all
dependent employees in those sectors, it bargains on behalf of the

nationwide workforce in both banking and insurance, and has been
able to conclude state-wide wage agreements in the wholesale and

retail trade sectors. The DEC union Nahrung, GenuE, GaststAtte

establishments,

although these contain large numbers of family businesses and

foreign workers. Moreover, because the tertiary sectors are
characterized by greater numbers of smaller firms and lower
membership rates in the employers' associations, the likelihood of
an extension is higher; 23% of all "extended" wage agreements, for

example, are in wholesale and retail trade.12 The German Federal

Labor Office reports extensions

in such diverse service

occupations as beauticians, transport workers, employees in the
eating and lodging trades, janitors, and security guards.13

An important implication of the strong industrial unionism

observed in West Germany is that wage agreements tend not to
reflect differences in regional labor market conditions. Table 6
documents contractual wages for most highly skilled metal workers

conditions. Schleswig-Holstein, Hamburg, Bremen, and Lower Saxony

disappearance

of significant wage drift over the same period

documented by Grundlach (1986)

indicates

that these wages

probably represent binding minima.

We have argued above that another institutional factor that

potentially limits the extent to which wages in the tertiary
sectors can fall is the provision of unemployment insurance (UI)

and related benefits. By creating a floor on wages paid by
service-producing industries, the UI system may function much like

a union. In Germany this certainly seems feasible: assuming they
qualify, unemployed workers receive 63% of their last wage for one

year (Arbeitslosengeld), and about 52% for the next year
(Arbeitsiosenhilfe), followed by a similar rate thereafter
(Sozialhilfe). For a comparative overview of the extent and
duration of coverage for an average married breadwinner, see Table

7, which we have taken from Burtless (1986). Not only is the West
German statutory replacement ratio considerably higher (66 versus

37% of last wage) but the period of coverage is considerably
longer (one year with indefinite extension versus 26 weeks).

Moreover, Minford (1985) suggests that in Germany actual
replacement ratios- -the fraction of net take-home pay received by
unemployed individuals- -

normally exceed the official statutory

ratios. This is due to fixed components and nonlinearities in the

benefit schedules, social welfare supplements, and the

tax

treatment of the benefit.

We have cited a litany of striking institutional differences

between the two economies that have the potential to block
salutory labor market adjustments in the service-producing

level of real wages in manufacturing and (2) the comparative
response of the two economies in the tertiary sectors.

Revisited

Wages j Manufacturing: fl Wage

Q.

The last decade witnessed a resurgence of interest in the
role of supply-related factors on growth and employment, and a

large literature now exists on the role of labor costs in
aggregate supply and the demand for employment.14 A central theme

of these comparative studies is the failure of real wages in
manufacturing to moderate sufficiently after a series of inward
shifts in the demand for labor. These shifts include the two OPEC

shocks, which may be likened to a one-time productivity regress,

the secular decline in manufacturing

terms

of trade brought

about by competition from newly industrializing economies, and
the worldwide productivity slowdown.

In the last five years, however, the "disequilibrium wage

hypothesis" as applied to the European economies has been
subjected to increasing criticism. That unemployment continued to
rise in recent years despite apparent wage moderation has prompted

many analysts to dismiss the relevance of wage levels for the
current labor market imbalance.15 Often cited is the fact that the

14See Sachs (1979,1983), Artus (1984), Bruno and Sachs (1985),
and Newell and Symons (1985).
15See for example Tobin (1984), Bruno (1986), and Gordon (1986).
22

1985 labor share of manufacturing in West Germany - -

tautologically

the ratio of aggregate product wages to average productivity- - has

fallen to levels of the early 1970s (see Figure 5). It is
important to note that any account of the rise in the NAIRU in

the Federal Republic of Germany that stresses the failure of
labor

market

clearing

requires a demonstration that real

product wages remain above levels consistent with high
employment.16

It is widely understood, however, that the wage share itself

contains no information about the consistency of wages with full
employment, since labor's current average product will generally

differ from average product at full employment)7 Some form of
adjustment is necessary for effects that additional employment

will have on the marginal, and average, product of labor. This
correction may have a neoclassical justification; an increase in

employment will reduce marginal product, and thereby the
correponding wage at high employment. An alternative correction,

suggested among others by Gordon (1986), is motivated by labor

hoarding or increasing returns to labor; it implies average
productivity may increase with labor input. These adjustments have
led to the "wage-gap" measure- -defined as the percentage deviation

of real product compensation levels from the (estimated) marginal

product of labor at high employment. Despite problems involving

productivity slowdown (Sachs 1979 and Bruno-Sachs 1985) as well as

membership induced hysteresis (Blanchard and Summers 1986) and
the capital shortage (Giersch 1981, Modigliani et.al.l986).

estimation of full employment labor supply, the specification and

estimation of an aggregate production function, and the
possibility of firm disequilibrium behavior, the use of the wage

gap concept by many analysts and the acceptance by the OECD and
the IMF of its "diagnostic function" (Bruno 1985) indicates its
utility in policy circles.

In his original investigation,

Sachs (1983) assumed a

Cobb-Douglas technology with Harrod-neutral technical progress.

While many have criticized the Cobb-Douglas assumption, which
implies constant factor shares in equilibrium, this criticism

seems largely unjustified.

If the true technology is CES

with substitution elasticity less than unity, a

Cobb-Douglas

assumption actually biases estimated wage gaps downward,

or

against the conclusion that wages are excessive.18 The constancy
of wage shares throughout the period of capital deepening in the

1960s is well-documented and difficult to explain jointly with
the runup of wage shares in the l970s unless (1) the production

technology is Cobb-Douglas with slow

adjustment or

(2)

parameters of technology are themselves changing over time. While

both Artus

(1984) and McCallum (1985) have estimated low

labor-capital substitution elasticities, these estimates may
criticized for not adequately considering disequilibrium firm
behavior, since departures from long run equilibrium may involve

both Keynesian (labor hoarding) and neoclassical (costs of
18Recall that the the local elasticity of labor demand when
production is CES with fixed capital stock is

24

adjustment) aspects. In the Appendix, we employ an error
correction model applied to nonstationary time series, (see for

example Granger and Engle 1987) to estimate the capital-labor
elasticity of substitution from the firm's first order condition
for profit maximization. The error correction model has the virtue

of imposing the estimated relationship only in the long run, while

allowing for short run deviations which are left relatively
unconstrained. We find strong evidence for the Cobb-Douglas
specification in aggregate West German manufacturing.

Given a Cobb-Douglas specification of technology, how does
one estimate the marginal product of labor at "high" employment?

Sachs (1983) assumed that employment in 1960,

1973 and 1979

equalled full employment, and interpolated peak-to-peak growth in

average productivity as its underlying trend at full employment,

which under Cobb-Douglas technology equals marginal productivity

up to a multiplicative constant. Since unemployment rates in
Germany have failed to fall significantly over the past recovery,

it would be incorrect to consider average productivity in the
l980s as deviations around "high employment" levels, just as it is

incorrect to consider the unadjusted wage share alone as an
indication of real wage levels.19

One approach, then, is to compute wage gaps using standard
neoclassical assumptions and estimates of relevant Cobb-Douglas
parameters, using capital stocks, imputed technical progress and

some estimate of "high employment hours." On the other hand,
Gordon (1986) has argued that there is a productivity dividend to

25

increased eniployrnent, which has been widely documented in the US

data, suggesting a potential upward bias in wage gaps computed

under the above procedure. One solution to this problem is to
estimate the unconstrained response of average productivity to an
increase in labor input. From these estimates the high employment
average (and under Cobb-Douglas assumptions, marginal) product can

be recovered. This procedure will identify and incorporate a
productivity dividend if it exists.

We recomputed wage gaps in manufacturing employing both
procedures, under the assumption that high employment labor supply

is simply equal to its average value over the 1970s.2° Both sets
of wage gaps are displayed in Table 8. Our results for West German

manufacturing continue to indicate a substantial wage gap, and a

striking absence of one in the US. We find no evidence of a
productivity dividend in West Germany, despite considerable
evidence of one in the US, belying Gordon's (1986) recent claim of

no difference in the productivity behavior between the US and
Europe. Our results thus corroborate those of Artus (1984), Bruno

(1986), and Sachs (1986) for West Germany and represent evidence
for a number of wage-related theories of unemployment.

A decomposition of the change in the estimated

wage gap

since 1970 can shed some light on the sources of the persistent
wage problem in West German manufacturing. In Table 9, it is clear

that while consumption wage growth has slowed considerably, the
relative price of manufactures continues to deterioriate, despite

a respite of falling oil prices and dollar appreciation. In

addition, growth of estimated productivity at high employment is

still lagging, although the imputed rate of technical progress

has actually recovered its earlier trend growth; as the table
makes clear, the culprit has been the cumulative effects of an

investment slowdown over the past decade.21 Not reflected in

We have argued that a variety of mechanisms operating in

the divergent job creation performance of US

services in the US is widely recognized, and often called the

"economic miracle" of the past decade. In a comparison of US
and West European employment growth, Wegner (1983) found while
that the composition of European employment has shifted towards

services, the shift has proceeded at a much a much slower rate
than in the US, in both absolute and relative terms. For evidence

on Germany, consider Figure 6, which compares total private
dependent status employment

in manufacturing and private

service-producing industries.

It could be claimed that the

sluggish performance of service employment merely reflects lower
overall growth. This view is rejected in Table 10, which compares
the percentage point change in the share of total dependent-status
employment
since 1960.

in broadly defined services

in the two countries

It is noteworthy that until the middle of the last

decade these shifts were roughly of the same magnitude in the
two countries; in the last decade the process in Germany has been

brought to a virtual

standstill.

To get an idea of the

magnitudes involved, had Germany sustained the same compositional

shifts as the US,

ho1din other employment constant, tertiary

sector employment would have exceeded current levels by another
950,000 jobs, or roughly 3.5% of the 1985 labor force!22

In Table 11 we compare average growth rates in per employee
real compensation in the Federal Republic of Germany and the US.
In real terms, compensation growth in West German tertiary sectors

has clearly outpaced its American counterparts, and has until
recently kept pace with the manufacturing sector. In the most
salient example, the average employee in the finance and insurance

1975,

tertiary dependent status employment in the FRG was

6,485 million or .251/.749 —

times all other dependent

private dependent employment in 1984 (18,272 million) = 7,868
million, compared to the actual 1984 figure of 6,904 million.

sector in Germany receives 1.21 times the average compensation in

manufacturing; in the US the comparable figure is 0;84. This
significant differential seems to be a direct outcome of HBV and

DAG (Deutsche Angestelite Gewerkschaft) nationwide collective
bargaining, as discussed in the last section. In wholesale and
retail trade, the average German receives compensation amounting

to .79 of the manufacturing average; in the US, the figure is
0.59. Only in private services are the ratios closer (0.68 in FR
Germany, 0.65 in the US)

23

Recall that a key prediction of the model involved the
evolution of the wage differential between the more unionized
manufacturing and the uncovered service sector. In the model with
an absorbing service sector, one would expect the differential to
increase; in the nonadjusting economy, the adjustment takes place

through higher unemployment. Figure 7, which plots the standard

deviation of log average compensation in the manufacturing,
trade, transport and communication, finance and private service

sectors, suggests that the US experience is characterized by a
marked increase in relative wage dispersion, confirming results

of Bell and Freeman

(1985) and Lawrence and Lawrence (1985).

Until 1975, relative wages in West Germany also followed this
pattern. In the past ten years, however, intersectoral

wage

dispersion in West Germany has actually fallen. While conflicting

results have been

reported within the industrial

sector

23lnterestingly, in the finance and trade sectors, US employment
growth has been very strong. Over the period 1980-84, dependent
status employment in FIRE and trade sectors increased 9.8 and 7.3%
respectively in the US; in FR Germany, employment in the financial
sector grew by only 3.1%, and in trade actually declined by 6.8%.

1985 and Bell and

Freeman 1985 report slight increases), our results shows an
unequivocal tightening of wage dispersion at the one-digit level.
It is not implausible that increasing unionization of the service
sectors has contributed to wage demands in these sectors linked to

those in dominant metal and chemical workers unions, an outcome
predicted by simple union models. Table 12 charts the variability

of compensation in the wholesale and retail trade, finance, and
services sectors relative to aggregate manufacturing in the two
countries over the past quarter decade. It depicts a significant
decrease in variability in West Germany compared with the United
States. Note that this decrease began in the mid-1970s, when the
economy was growing rapidly.

Trends in labor productivity in the tertiary industries
provide additional support for our thesis. In a recent survey of
the two countries, Wegner (1985) identified value-added per hour

as the most salient feature distinguishing the performance of
tertiary sectors in the US and West Germany. We reproduce his

findings in Table 13. It seems unlikely that these striking
productivity differences are solely attributable to different
production techniques available in the two economies. Rather, the

behavior of capital-labor ratios in these sectors support the
contention that producers of services in the two countries are

responding to differing relative prices. Figure 8 documents a
secular pace of capital deepening in aggregate services in West
Germany that is largely absent in the US; moreover, this trend is

across

countries, this outcome is predicted directly by West

Germany service industries facing a higher real price of labor.
Table 14, which displays average growth in capital-labor ratios at

the one-digit level service sectors, gives clear evidence of
higher capital intensity in Germany, and more importantly, a break
in the mid-l970s.

To summarize, Germany has not experienced the strong growth

of service employment observed in the US. This might seem
puzzling, since output growth in these sectors has not been
insignificant.24 Clearly, some of this differential

is due to

slower growth rates of labor force participation in the Germany;

nonetheless, until the niid-1970s the shift to a service economy

was taking place at the same proportionate rate, while the
past ten years have witnessed a departure from the trend shared
with the US. Given the evidence on lower wage dispersion, markedly

higher rates of labor productivity

growth, and capital-labor

ratios, we suspect that the "wage problem" has manifested itself
in the German service sector.

5. Conclusion

High unemployment in West Germany has become an accepted and

conspicuous feature of the world economic picture. The paths of

communication sector grew by 7.5%, (7.3% in transport and public
utilities in the US); banking and insurance 8.7% (9.6% in US); and

personal services 8.6% (15.7%in US). Less impressive were the
trade sector with 4.7% growth (20.9% in US) and, of course,
manufacturing with a paltry 0.9% real growth (11.4% in US).

unemployment and inflation, however, suggest that aggregate demand
factors can only go part of the way in explaining the secular rise

of joblessness in this country. We conclude that underlying real
factors have raised the NAIRU, or equilibrium rate.

We were unable to find any evidence that the rise in the

NAIRU in West Germany is due to an increase in "frictional"
unemployment. Rather, in comparing the relative labor market
performance of Germany and the US, we suggest that nonadjustnient
of wages to adverse shocks and to unemployment itself should bear

the brunt of blame. Whereas the US economy has responded to the
adverse supply shocks of the l970s with the creation of 20 million

jobs in services, job creation in the tertiary sectors of West

Germany was grossly insufficient to offset the reduction of
employment in manufacturing. We find the data highly consistent

with the hypothesis that wage rigidity in services- -due to
unionization, minimum wage provisions,

or overly generous

unemployment benefits- -has obstructed rapid labor intensive growth

in these sectors and can help to explain the continuing rise in
West German unemployment.

It is easy to rewrite the first order condition as:
SK —

where

(Al)

a(V/K)1'

is capital's share in value-added. If K is not fixed, the

condition will continue to hold, but the level of output is
indeterminate and must be fixed elsewhere.Note how (Al) does not
involve either A1 or A2. Taking logs, we obtain

ln 5Kt —

lna + pln(V/K)

(A2)

If firms were always on the production function, one could
regard (A2) as a regression equation. Generally, firms will be off

the production for a variety of reasons. Costs of adjusting labor

input may retard the reaction of firms to changes in relative
factor prices. If there are fixed costs to hiring and firing,
firms may hoard labor over the cycle. Clearly if (A2) is estimated

directly, ignoring these phenomena, a left-out variable bias will

33

arise. If the omitted adjustment term is negatively correlated
with V/K and makes a negative contribution to capital share, it
will tend to bias estimates of p upward, and thus of a downward.

The model presents an ideal application of an error
correction model, which effectively only imposes the estimated
relationship at the lowest frequencies.25 If ln(V/K) and in

are

cointegrated with cointegrating vector [1 -ma -p1, then although
the individual series are nonstationary, the linear combination

in s - ma

is stationary. One error correction model that incorporates this
restriction is

ln SKt —

in the levels as

and given estimates of the &s, the parameter of interest here, p
(which is exactly identified), may be solved as -(a34-a4)/(a1+a2).26

The regression results of estimating (A3) are presented in Table
Al. The estimated value of p is -(-O.758l+O..7878)/(l..3971- .4892)

= -.0327); implying a value of a of 1.034. The US results imply p—
0.1775 and a=O.849. The estimates appear in Table Al.

II
Computation of Wage Gaps

The wage gap is defined as the difference between actual

wage and that which

clears the market when L—L (at high

employment). By the national income identity, technical progress
may be estimated using Solow's method (see Bruno and Sachs 1985).

That is, we approximate the continuous time full employment
relationship under Harrod neutral technical progress:

Vt

—

sLt(lt+

a) + SKtkt

with

—

sLt i(tl+ óa) + SKt1 kt

so

=

l+ s1(óv- sKtlâkt)

(A4)

The resulting series was then projected on a constant and a fourth

order polynomial in time. The fitted series were

used as the

imputed technical progress. They are presented in Table A2. If

a

production is given by V—K (AL)

1-a 1-a a 1-a

—A K L

product of labor at high employment

,

then the average

V/Li is given by

A1(1-a)(K/L). To compute this we used employment,

gross

constant-price capital stocks, and the imputed technical progress
series. The high employment labor supply Lwas taken to be average

of annual manufacturing man-hours in the l970s. Given that US
manufacturing employment is roughly at its 1970s average this may
be the appropriate benchmark.

Alternatively, we estimated the following equation using
36

manufacturing data, using both OLS and instrumental variables:

—

a1+ a2l 1+ a3k +

a4v+

a5t +a6t +

a7t

where lower case letters indicate logarithms. Next, one can solve
this equation for steady state output:

v —

(l/a4)[a3k

+

(l-a2)l

(a1+ a4v-4- a5t +a6t +

a7t)]

Now subtract l from both sides:

v-l.- (l/a4)[-a3k+ (la2a4)l (a1+ a4v+ a5t +a6t +

a7tfl

Substituting i for 1, we have the average product at full
employment:

(i/a4)[a3k+ (l-a2-a4)l- (a1+ a4v+ a5t +a6t +

a7t)]

If there is a productivity dividend, (l-a2-a4)/a4 will be greater

than unity.

Note that we do not impose the constant

returns restriction at estimation, which is a4=l-a2-a3.
