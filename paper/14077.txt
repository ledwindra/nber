ABSTRACT
For two decades, the consensus explanation of the British Industrial Revolution has placed technological
change and the supply side at center stage, affording little or no role for demand or overseas trade.
Recently, alternative explanations have placed an emphasis on the importance of trade with New World
colonies, and the expanded supply of raw cotton it provided. We test both hypotheses using calibrated
general equilibrium models of the British economy and the rest of the world for 1760 and 1850. Neither
claim is supported. Trade was vital for the progress of the industrial revolution; but it was trade with
the rest of the world, not the American colonies, that allowed Britain to export its rapidly expanding
textile output and achieve growth through extreme specialization in response to shifting comparative
advantage.

The Industrial Revolution in Britain coincided with victory over the French in a struggle for
world domination. After more than a century of struggle, in 1815 Britannia finally ruled the
waves. The British used that mastery to gain access across the globe to raw materials and
export markets. British trade with both the New World and the Old escalated.
Earlier histories of the Industrial Revolution linked military success, the expansion of
trade, and the onset of modern growth (e.g., H. John Habakkuk and Phyllis Deane 1963).
More recent accounts, however, starting with Joel Mokyr (1977), have emphasized in
contrast its “home grown” nature. Technological advances in cotton textiles, iron and steel,
and transport generated within Britain lie at its core (e.g., Nicholas F. R. Crafts, 1985, Mokyr,
2005). The struggle for world domination, for colonies and markets, was of secondary
importance. As Robert P. Thomas and Deirdre N. McCloskey (1981, p. 102) memorably
noted, “Trade was the child of industry.” This consensus has been in turn challenged by
Kenneth Pomeranz (2000). In his “coal and colonies” interpretation of the Industrial
Revolution, Britain and not China had an Industrial Revolution in part because Britain had
access to the raw materials of the New World, while China did not.
This paper sets out to test, with a formal CGE model, the role of trade with the New
World, and trade itself, in explaining the growth of productivity and income in Industrial
Revolution Britain. We find, to our surprise, that the New World mattered little, even by the
1850s. Had the Americas not existed, the Industrial Revolution would still have looked much
as it did in practice. There were ready substitutes for the cotton, sugar, corn and timber of the
New World in Eastern Europe, the Near East and South Asia.
However, had all trade barriers been substantial—if, say, a victorious France had cut off
Britain’s access to overseas trade—then British history would have been very different.
British incomes per person, instead of rising by 45% between the 1760s and 1850s, would
have risen by a mere 5%. The TFP growth rate, already a modest 0.4% per year, would have

1

fallen to 0.22% per year.
The magnitude, scale and transforming power of the Industrial Revolution lay in its
unification of technological advance with the military power that generated easy British
access to the markets of Europe, the Americas, the Near East and the Far East. As Ronald
Findlay and Kevin H. O’Rourke (2007) emphasize, trade in a mercantilist world was not just
the product of comparative advantage, but of comparative advantage married to the musket
and the cannon. Britain’s trading partners gained, however, along with Britain from the
forced opening up of trade. A substantial share of the British TFP gain over these years was
exported as cheaper manufactures to the rest of the world (Gregory Clark 2007a).
I. The Model
We ask what Industrial Revolution Britain would have looked like had trading opportunities
with North America (and the Caribbean), or the rest of the world, been removed. We could
use a simple Britain-only model and impose counterfactual trade levels, but as Nancy L.
Stokey (2001) notes this approach is limited; absent detailed disaggregation it says nothing
about cotton textiles and absent other regions and the terms-of-trade it says nothing about
income and welfare. Our preferred tool is a three-region world economy model, for two
benchmark periods, 1760–9 and 1850–9, the start and end of the Industrial Revolution. The
model thus extends the two-region Industrial Revolution models developed by Crafts and
Knick Harley (Harley and Crafts, 2000).
The computable general equilibrium model is fully described by two sets of information.
The first is an accounting matrix for each region listing for each sector the value of goods
produced, imported, and exported—and hence the domestic demand for those goods—and
also the cost structure (inputs of primary factors and intermediate goods). The sectors are
cotton textiles; other textiles; iron and steel; coal; agriculture; tropical raw materials; tropical
food; and the rest of the economy. The factors are land, labor, and capital. All factors are

2

region-specific but mobile across sectors (although land is used only in agriculture, tropical
raw materials, and tropical food). The intermediate inputs accounted for by this model are:
coal into iron and steel; agricultural products into other textiles and coal; and tropical raw
materials into cotton textiles and other textiles (and, for the 1850s, into agriculture and the
rest of the economy as well).
The three regions are England (1760s) and later Britain (1850s); North America
(including the Caribbean); and the Rest of the World (including Ireland). Trade is assumed
costless. Goods produced in each region are assumed to be imperfect substitutes for each
other, which allows two-way trade in the model. Imports and exports for each commodity are
thus broken down by source and destination. Tropical raw materials and foods are produced
in North America and the Rest of the World, but not in Britain. The regional production and
trade matrices fully describe the static benchmark equilibrium, and are given in the appendix.
The second thing we need is a set of elasticities that describe the response of the
economy to perturbations. Sectoral production is modelled as a Leontief combination of
intermediate inputs and a value added aggregate. Value added is in turn a CES aggregate of
the primary inputs. The elasticities of substitution in each sector are similar to those used by
Harley and Crafts (2000): elasticities are 1 (Cobb-Douglas) in cotton textiles, other textiles,
iron and steel, coal, and the rest of the economy; elasticities are 0.5 in agriculture, tropical
raw materials, and tropical food. Consumption is modelled by assuming a representative
agent in each region, endowed with all primary factors of production in that region, and
spending all her income on a composite utility good (the production of which thus serves as a
welfare indicator). The utility good is produced by a CES utility function, with all eight
commodities as inputs, and an elasticity of substitution of 0.5.
What consumers consume, and what sectors use as intermediate inputs, are actually
aggregates of the different varieties of each commodity produced in each of the three regions.

3

These 24 Armington aggregates, one for each sector and region, are again CES combinations
of the three varieties of the relevant commodity. Values of the Armington elasticities of
substitution used for each commodity are close to those used by Harley and Crafts: we used
values of 5 for cotton textiles, iron and steel, and coal; 2 for ‘other textiles’ and the rest of the
economy; and 100 for agriculture. The Armington elasticities for tropical raw materials and
food are particularly important for the counterfactual experiments we conducted, and we
consider these separately below.
II. Calibration and Counterfactuals
To set up the model we sourced data as follows. The total value of English/British
expenditure and its composition across different goods was taken from Clark (2007b).
Imports and exports of each type of good were then taken from Ralph Davis (1962, 1979).
Thus, the value of the production of each good could then be inferred. We imposed zero
production of both tropical goods in Britain. Next, based on our rough estimates of factor
shares and intermediate costs shares we were able to compute the input-output structure and
the value of payments to factors in each sector, and thus in the aggregate. Via the circular
flow, these factor payments equal total expenditure. For simplicity, we adjusted the rest of the
economy sector’s output and exports to impose balanced trade, although our results do not
depend on this assumption.
A different procedure was followed for the other two regions. For North America we
assumed that final expenditure in each period on each good was a simple multiple of British
expenditure, scaling by population relative to England/Britain, and thus assuming the same
relative living standard (except that coal consumption was set equal to imports from Britain).
For the Rest of the World we assumed that incomes per person relative to England were the
same in the 1760s, and at 40% of the British level by the 1850s. In the rest of the world we
imposed an assumed pattern of final consumption in each period, with the following weights

4

for each sector: cotton textiles, 0.02, other textiles, 0.04, iron and steel, 0.01, coal, 0.001,
temperate agriculture, 0.375, tropical agriculture, 0.375, rest of the economy, 0.18. Thomas
Ellison’s discussion of cotton consumption per person in India in the 1850s suggests this is
probably an underestimate of cotton and cotton goods production in the rest of the world,
even though it implies that the cotton industry in the rest of the world was nearly 5 times as
large as in England (Ellison, 1858, p. 73). Import and export data were then constructed using
the Davis (1962, 1979) data for trade with England/Britain and some auxiliary data and
assumptions.1 Table 1 shows the resulting estimated trade patterns in the 1760s and 1850s.
From the consumption and trade patterns we infer production patterns and, assuming that
input cost shares in each sector were like those in Britain, we infer payments to intermediates
and to all factors. Once again, factor incomes are equal to expenditure by construction, and
trade was forced to be balanced by adjusting the rest of the economy sector in each case.
With the model set up we impose various counterfactual shocks and see how the model
world economy would react. Our interest is in evaluating the hypothesis that the British
Industrial Revolution depended crucially on international trade—either with North America,
the Rest of the World, or both. To that end, we impose three different counterfactual shocks
on the model:
a. “No NA”: Reduce North American endowments by a factor of 20;
b. “No ROW”: Reduce Rest of the World endowments by a factor of 20;
c. “No NA/ROW”: Reduce both sets of endowments by a factor of 20;
Note that we cannot entirely eliminate each region’s endowments since each region makes a
differentiated product, whose price would be infinite were its supply to be reduced to zero,

In the 1760s case, we assume the Navigation Acts excluded direct trade between North America and the Rest
of the World, and use Davis’s re-export data to estimate the bilateral trade pattern between North America and
the Rest of the World. In the 1850s, the assumption is dropped, so we use Douglas Irwin’s North American
trade data (Susan Carter et al. 2006) by good and by region, assuming that America’s import pattern from the
Rest of the World was similar to Britain’s, and its export pattern to the Rest of the World was similar to its
export pattern to Britain.

but these endowment shocks provide a reasonable estimate of the gains from trade to the
British economy that would have been sacrificed had trade been made almost impossibly
costly.
The purpose of the three experiments is to gauge how vital a contribution trade with each
region, and trade as a whole, made to the structural transformation and growth of the British
economy. For example, the “No NA” shock permits us to grapple with the thesis of Pomeranz
(2000) and see how critical New World supplies of raw cotton were to the rise of Lancashire.
The “No ROW” shock allows us to see the importance of other major export markets for
Lancashire’s cotton products, as well as the role played by alternative suppliers of raw cotton
like Egypt and India. In the remainder of the paper we describe the results of these
counterfactuals and how they pose a challenge to current interpretations of the Industrial
Revolution.
III. Results
The results are given in Tables 2 and 3, but the intuition behind the results comes from the
trade data in Table 1. The results depend largely on trade patterns in the 1760s and 1850s.
Several differences between the two periods stand out. First, and most obviously, in the
1760s England was still a large net importer of cotton textiles from the rest of the world,
which also exported textiles to North America. By the 1850s, Britain was a large net exporter
of cotton textiles to both the other regions, thanks to the new technologies of the Industrial
Revolution. Second, in the 1760s England was paying for her imports of food and tropical
products primarily with net exports of “other” goods, and of woollens and other textiles. By
the 1850s, exports of non-cotton textiles had declined in relative importance: cotton textiles
and exports of “other” goods were now relatively speaking far more dominant. A third point
to note is that in the 1760s, imports of tropical raw materials came predominantly from the
rest of the world, while imports of tropical food came predominantly from North America.

6

By the 1850s, imports of tropical raw materials from North America had considerably grown
in relative importance, thanks to the boom in raw cotton exports, while the rest of the world
was now more important than North America as a source of tropical food imports.
Both “tropical raw materials” and “tropical food” cover a wide variety of goods from
many regions of the world. From the British point of view, a crucial question, had trade with
North America been impossible, is how easily could the raw cotton crucial for the growing
cotton textile industry have been provided by the rest of the world. The experience of the
early 1860s, when Brazil, Egypt and above all India sharply increased their exports to Britain
in response to the “cotton famine,” suggests there would indeed have been a compensatory
supply response from the rest of the world, although not a perfectly elastic one, since British
industry did suffer during the cotton famine.
In our model, the issue boils down to the size of the Armington elasticity of substitution
between the tropical raw materials Britain was importing from North America and the rest of
the world. We experimented with several values for this elasticity, as well as with the
corresponding elasticity for tropical food. While the elasticity of substitution between New
World sugar and Asian pepper, say, might not have mattered for the fortunes of British
industry, it should have had an impact on British consumer welfare, in a counterfactual world
in which Britain was prevented from trading with either of the two regions. In our benchmark
specification, these elasticities are both set to 5, since these are the ‘upper end’ Armington
elasticities used by Harley and Crafts, but we also tried lowering the elasticities to 2, and
increasing them to 100 (equivalent to making the different varieties of these goods almost
perfect substitutes).
Table 2 gives the results of isolating England from its trading partners in the 1760s. For
each of our three counterfactual scenarios, the model generated outputs in each sector; prices
in each sector; nominal factor prices; the price of the utility good, which is equivalent to a

7

consumer price index; nominal household income; real factor prices and household income;
and utility (i.e. the output of the utility good). The most important point is that preventing
trade between England and North America would have had barely any effect on England. In
the benchmark case, utility declines by less than 2%, with a modest real wage decline of
4.3%, a decline in real profits of 5.7%, and a rise in real land rents of 9.4%. Cotton textiles
output would have gone down only barely: by just 1.1%, as compared with a decline in the
output of other textiles of almost a tenth, the latter due to the disappearance of North
American markets.
Removing the rest of the world would have had a bigger effect, since it was a much
bigger region. Strikingly, eliminating trade between England and the rest of the world in the
1760s would have increased English cotton textile output by a third, since England was still a
net importer of Indian cotton textiles. Similarly, English agricultural output would have
expanded (by 8.8%) to replace food imported from the rest of Europe. As a result all other
sectors would have contracted, as resources were sucked away from them. Utility would have
declined less than previously (1.7%), but with greater distributional shifts, since in the 1760s
English imports of temperate climate agricultural products still came predominantly from
Europe rather than from North America (or other continents). Thus English landlords would
have seen real incomes rise by over a quarter, while workers and capitalists would have seen
real incomes declines of 7.9% and 10.6% respectively.
Not surprisingly, ‘eliminating’ both North America and the rest of the world has an even
bigger impact on the traditional textile sector, cutting it by over a quarter. Cotton textiles
production would have increased by a quarter, and agriculture by 14.5%. Real rents increase
by 44.9%, at the expense of real wages (down 13.9%) and real profits (down a fifth), but the
aggregate utility effect would still have been surprisingly small (a decline of less than 4%).
Finally, note that varying the Armington elasticities for tropical food and tropical raw

8

materials would have barely changed the results.
Table 3 shows that the results are very different for the 1850s. Cutting off trade with
North America in the benchmark case would have lowered cotton textiles output by 8%, and
other textiles output by a tenth. Cotton textiles output would have declined both because of
the disruption to raw cotton supplies, and because of the loss of markets. On balance, the
former effect seems to be more important, since the real price of British cotton textiles
increases in this simulation. Furthermore, when the elasticity of substitution between tropical
raw materials from North America and the rest of the world is lowered to from its benchmark
value of 5 to 2, implying that the rest of the world was less able to substitute for lost
American raw cotton supplies, British cotton textiles output contracts by more (15%-18%).
On the other hand, if that elasticity is raised to 100, then the output only falls by 2%. Utility
falls by between 1.6% and 3.6%, depending on the sizes of Armington elasticities chosen,
with larger elasticities corresponding to lower welfare losses. While these are larger welfare
effects than those calculated for the 1760s, they are still modest. The rest of the world could
have filled in for a missing North America, providing markets, raw materials and tropical
food products, and so minimising the overall loss to the British economy. Once again,
landlords would have gained by roughly 10%, at the expense of workers and capitalists.
On the other hand, the welfare loss is much greater—over 10%—when trade with the rest
of the world, rather than North America, is eliminated. Cotton textiles output contracts by
over a third, as the foreign markets upon which Lancashire was increasingly dependent
vanish. (Note the difference with the results for the 1760s: by the 1850s Britain was a net
exporter of cotton textiles to India and the rest of the world, rather than a net importer.) Since
the rest of the world mattered for the British cotton textiles industry more by providing
markets than by providing raw cotton, it is not surprising that the two Armington elasticities
highlighted earlier turned out to be essentially irrelevant for this counterfactual experiment.

9

Consistent with Stokey (2001), the distributional effects of this shock are enormous, with real
rents more than doubling, and real wages and profits declining by over a fifth. In terms of
TFP performance, a decline of a third in the cotton textile sector would have lowered the
economy-wide TFP growth rate by .06% per annum, or by 6% over the entire 1760s-1850s
period (assuming unchanged sector-specific TFP growth rates).
Finally, “eliminating” all of Britain’s trading partners would have had an even bigger
effect on the economy, with utility falling by over 27% in the benchmark case (again, this
result was invariant to changes in the two afore-mentioned Armington elasticities). This is an
enormous effect in the context of a model with no increasing returns or other non-concavities,
and is much larger than previous estimates in the literature (for example, according to Harley
(2004, p. 194), “Self-sufficiency in 1860...would have cost Britain only...about 6 per cent of
national income”). Cotton textiles output would have declined by almost three-fifths,
implying a reduction in the economy-wide TFP growth rate of 0.11%, more than a quarter of
the Industrial Revolution productivity growth rate, while real wages and profits would have
declined by over a third. If we had been able to go further, and completely eliminate Britain’s
trading partners, the effects on economy-wide welfare and textiles output would obviously
have been even greater (and the crucial cotton textiles sector would of course have vanished
altogether). And ours may yet be a conservative estimate of hypothetical TFP losses, for if
the dynamic cotton textiles sector had grown more slowly, then the incentives to innovate (or
even passive “learning by doing” opportunities) might have been scaled down too.
IV. Conclusion
While colonies were not required for an Industrial Revolution, supply-side TFP growth was
not alone sufficient. In Smithian terms, in the 19th-century global “division of labor” it was
the “power of exchanging” that “gave occasion” to the Industrial Revolution. The highly
specialized British economy was extremely dependent on foreign trade by the 1850s.

10

It is worth emphasising why the 1850s results are so different from the 1760s. This has
nothing to do with model specification. The model is identical in both cases, as are all the
embedded elasticities. The different results arise from the data fed into the model, which in
turn reflect the profound shifts in the structure of the British economy during the Industrial
Revolution. First, unbalanced productivity growth meant that British autarkic relative prices
diverged from those in the rest of the world, implying much larger gains from trade. The
cotton textiles sector became dependent on foreign markets for about 60% of its total sales.
Second, British population growth meant that the island depended on foreign agriculture for
both food and raw materials, implying that it needed to export a growing amount of
manufactures to pay for these imports (Harley and Crafts 2000; Clark 2007a).
As a famous Welsh economic historian put it, “How could this unprecedented
swarming of people on a small, offshore island be made consistent with a rising standard of
living? It was impossible on the fixed area of English cultivable land, whatever miracles
English technological progress in agriculture might accomplish. The way out was for
England (through a transportation revolution and international trade) to endow itself with the
equivalent of a vast extension of its own land base” (Brinley Thomas 1985, p. 731). In that
context, by the mid 19th century, the maintenance of an open international trading system was
of vital strategic importance to Britain.

Data Appendix
The social accounting matrices for the three regions at the two benchmark dates are shown at
the end of this appendix, and they were constructed as follows.
Great Britain, 1850s
Cotton textiles: Cotton here includes cotton and linen and jute. The value of output is taken as
£67.8 m. based on value of imports of cotton, flax, indigo and other dyestuffs of £31.6 m.
(Davis 1979, 109, 124–5) and a markup estimate (Harley 1998, table 5, 64). Labor and capital
shares in value added are assumed 50:50 based on Harley (1998), and Harley and Crafts
(2000), but modifying for the absence in our model of the non-traded sector. The implied
value added in “cottons” is 6.3% of total value added. The employment share of this sector in
England and Wales in 1851 was 5.9%, so this figure seems reasonable (Parliamentary Papers,
1852–3).
Other textiles: These are the wool and silk industries. The value of outputs of £60.4 m. and
intermediate inputs (£15.8 for wool and £6.3 for silk) are from Deane and Cole (1967,
196–210) and Davis (1979). Labor and capital shares are again taken as 50:50. The implied
value added here is 6.6%. That makes the combined value added in all the textile industries
12.9%. The employment share of all textiles in 1851 in England and Wales was 11%, but this
is assumed a more capital intensive sector than on average.
Iron and steel: This is here taken to include other metals and metal manufactures such as tin,
copper, lead and zinc. Employment in these sectors was 5.5% of all employment in England
and Wales in 1851. To account for these other metal sectors output was taken as £69.4, 1.5
times the output for iron alone given by Deane and Cole (1967, 225) figure for iron alone.
Coal inputs of £11 m. calculated from coal required per ton given in Hyde (1977, 142, 153).
Labor and capital shares are 67:33 based on Harley and Crafts (2000). This implies a value
added share of 10.1%. The employment share of the metal industries in England and Wales
was just 5.5%, but given the high assumed capital/labor ratio this is reasonable.
Coal: A physical net output of 65 m tons for Great Britain was estimated from Church (1986,
3, 19). This corresponded to a value of £37.1 based on an average price at final consumption
of £0.57. There was a domestic farm input of horses, oats, timber, etc., of £0.8 from Church
(1986, 502, 521–2). Labor, capital, and land shares of 0.61, 0.27, and 0.12 are based on Clark
and Jacks (2007, table 6, 55).
Agriculture: British output of £123.8 estimated by scaling up the estimated English output of
£96.2 given in Clark (2002, table 2) by the relative farm areas of Britain and England (1.26:1)
in 1866. Inputs of guano, etc. from UK imports given by Davis (1979) assuming all of this
went to British agriculture . Labor, capital, and land shares of 0.41, 0.15, and 0.44 are based
on Clark (2002), table 2. These outputs are again scaled up to Britain by multiplying by the
relative farm areas of Britain and England in 1866.
Rest of the economy: Total nominal GDP for Britain of £576.6 was calculated by scaling up
figure of £503.8 for England and Wales from Clark (2001), table 3, by the ratio of British to
English and Welsh populations (21.81:18.83). Value added in the rest of the economy is
calculated as a residual between this scaled up figure and the sums of output for the above
industries. All tropical raw materials not used as inports in other sectors are assumed to be
inputs here. In this sector, which includes large amounts of services, the inputs were assumed
to be 70% labor and 30% capital.
Imports: Imports are partitioned into those from North America and the Caribbean, and those
from the rest of World (including Ireland). For North America and the Caribbean, and the rest
17

of World, the data are from Davis (1979), pp. 109, 124–5 on imports minus re-exports into
the UK, and are the average of the years 1854–6.
The Davis figures include Ireland. We thus need to allocate these imports between Britain
and Ireland. Ireland’s population was 21.6% of UK population, but since we assume Irish
income per person was only 0.6 of that in the UK (comparing wages as in Clark (2005), and
Geary and Stark (2004)), Irish income was only 14.2% of UK income. We assume the only
imports to the UK going to Ireland were tropical foods (tea, coffee, sugar etc.), and allocate
these proportionally to income. This gives Ireland £3.2 m. of such imports, compared to
British consumption of £19.0 m.
Ireland is assumed to export just linen textiles and food to England. We assume linen imports
to Britain from Ireland equal British cotton textiles exports from Britain to Ireland. We
assume consumption of each good in Ireland is 16.55% of British consumption based on the
estimated relative incomes above (and implicitly assuming that preferences are identical and
homothetic in Ireland and Britain). That makes Irish cotton textile consumption £4.7 m., and
hence linen exports £4.7 m. also.
Agricultural output in Ireland is assumed to be the same per acre as in Britain. Based on 1866
acreages this makes it £56.0, compared to £123.8 in Britain. Since final UK consumption is
£218.5 this makes Irish agricultural exports to Britain £25 m.
Total final use: Sum of all the above. (Final use here means total supply to the market net of
intermediate use.)
Exports: Exports to Ireland, North America and the Caribbean, and the rest of World are
calculated separately. For North America and the Caribbean, and the rest of World the data is
from Davis (1979), p. 101, and is the average of 1854–6.
Exports of cotton, iron and steel and coal to Ireland are based on the assumption that Britain
produces the entire UK output, and Irish consumption is 0.142 of the UK total. To balance
trade between Britain and Ireland we assume Britain exports £10.25 m. of “rest of the
economy goods to Ireland.” This makes total British exports to Ireland £29.7 m.
A balancing factor of £38.2 is added to rest of the economy exports to the rest of the world to
assure overall trade balance in the UK as well as in Britain.
Rest of the World, 1850s
Production: In each sector, output is total final use minus imports plus intermediate uses. All
intermediate input shares are as in Britain, except coal is replaced by wood produced in the
agricultural sector. Labor and capital shares are assumed at 70:30 for cotton textiles, other
textiles, iron and steel, coal and the rest of the economy, reflecting less mechanization (lower
capital shares) than in Britain. The labor, capital and rent shares in agriculture, tropical raw
materials and tropical food are set at 40%, 20%, and 40% as in British agriculture.
Production plus net imports is set to final consumption.
Imports: Imports from the UK are based on Davis’s export data for the UK to the rest of the
world for 1854–6, adding in British exports to Ireland. Exports from North America and the
Caribbean to the rest of the world are assumed to have same composition as UK imports from
this region. The level of exports from US to the rest of the world is estimated from Doug
Irwin’s U.S. Historical Statistics exports estimate of $144 million total exports from the US
compared to $71 million going to the UK in 1850 (Irwin, 2006a).

18

Exports: Exports to the UK are based on Davis’s import data for the UK from the rest of the
world. Exports from the rest of the world to North America and the Caribbean are assumed to
have same composition. The level of exports from the rest of the world to North America and
the Caribbean is computed from Irwin’s U.S. Historical Statistics total US imports estimate
of $174 million, with $75 million coming from the UK, in 1850 (Irwin, 2006b). A balancing
factor of £22.8 m. is added to rest of the economy exports from the rest of the world to North
America to assure overall trade balance in both the rest of the world and North America and
the Caribbean.
Consumption: We assume the rest of the world total consumption expenditure is £13,118.4
m., given by British consumption times 22.75. This ratio is based on an assumed rest of
world:British population ratio of 1,240:21.8 and a consumption per person ratio of 40%. This
assumes a total world population of 1,300 in the 1850s based on the estimates of Durand
(1977), Haub (1995) and McElready and Jones (1978). We assume consumption weights in
the rest of the world are: cotton textiles 2%, other textiles 4%, iron and steel 1%, coal 0.1 %,
temperate agriculture 37.5%, tropical raw materials 0%, tropical food 37.5%, and the balance
for rest of the economy. These shares are adjusted from those of Britain to reflect lower
incomes and higher textile prices, based in part on Clark (2007), 40–70. Thus in Britain
cotton textiles were 4.9% and other textiles 8.8%.
Total final use: For each sector this is consumption plus exports minus imports.
North America and Caribbean, 1850
Production: In each sector, output is total final use minus imports plus intermediate uses.
Coal output and input use is set to zero (forcing imports to go to consumption). All
intermediate input shares are as in Britain, except coal is replaced by wood from agriculture.
Labor and capital shares are assumed at 50:50 for cotton textiles, and other textiles; at 33:67
for iron and steel, and 70:30 for the rest of the economy, reflecting assumed similar
mechanization levels to Britain. Labor, capital and rent shares in agriculture, tropical raw
materials and tropical food are set at 40%, 20% and 40% as in British agriculture.
Imports: Imports from the UK are based on Davis’s export data for Britain to North America
and the Caribbean. Imports from the rest of the world to this region are assumed to equal
exports by the rest of the world to North America.
Exports: Exports to the UK are based on Davis import data for Britain from the rest of the
world. Exports to the rest of the world are assumed to equal imports by the rest of the world
from North America.
Consumption: We assume total consumption expenditure in North America and the
Caribbean was £1101.6, given by British consumption times 1.91. This ratio is based on an
assumed North America and the Caribbean: British population ratio of 41.7:21.8 (Mitchell,
2003), and a North American and Caribbean consumption per person equal to that of Britain
per person. We assume homothetic identical preferences in Britain and North America and
the Caribbean.
Total final use: For each sector, consumption plus exports minus imports.
England, 1760.
Cotton textiles: Cotton again includes cotton and linen and jute. The value of output is taken
as £1.4 m. based on value of imports of cotton, flax, indigo and other dyestuffs of £0.19 m.
19

(Davis, 1962, 300) and markup estimate (Harley, 1998, table 5, p. 64). Labor and capital
shares are assumed 50:50 as in the 1850s.
Other textiles: Represents wool and silk. The value of outputs £14.88 and intermediate inputs
of wool and flax (£3.15) are from Deane and Cole, 1967, 196, 210. Raw and thrown silk
inputs (£0.75) are from Davis (1962), 300. Labor and capital shares are assumed 50:50 based
on the 1850s shares.
Iron and steel: The output of £1.57 m. is from Deane and Cole (1967, 221). The coal input of
£0.19 m. is calculated from the input:output ratios given in Hyde and coal prices calculated
from Clark and Jacks (2007, 67). Labor and capital shares are 67:33 based on Harley and
Crafts (2000).
Coal: Output of £3.41 m. from Flinn (1984) estimate of output of 6 m. tons and final
consumption price of £0.57. Agricultural input of horses, oats, timber, etc., of £0.04 m. from
Church (1986, 502, 521–2). Labor, capital, and land shares of 0.61, 0.27, and 0.12 are based
on Clark and Jacks (2007, table 6, 55) as in 1850.
Agriculture: Output of £38.9 m. and labor, capital, and land shares of 0.38, 0.14 and 0.48
from Clark (2002, table 2).
Rest of the economy: Nominal GDP of £95.3 m. from Clark (2001), table 3. Value added
based on residual GDP not accounted for by other sectors. Labor and capital shares are 70:30
as in 1850.
Imports: Imports from North America and the Caribbean, and the rest of world are from
Davis (1962), pp. 300–1. Since Davis only gives data for 1752–4 and 1772–4, the figures for
1772–4 were used.
Total final use: This is the sum of production and imports minus intermediate uses for each
sector. Final use here means total supply to the market net of intermediate use.
Exports: Exports to North America and the Caribbean, and to the rest of world are from
Davis (1962), pp. 302–3. Since Davis only gives data for 1752–4 and 1772–4, the figures for
1772–4 were used. A balancing factor of £2.88 is added to rest of the economy exports to the
rest of the world to assure overall trade balance for England.
Rest of the World, 1760
Production: In each sector, output is total final use minus imports plus intermediate use. All
intermediate input shares are as in England, except coal is replaced by lumber (agriculture).
Labor and capital shares are assumed at 70:30 for cotton textiles, other textiles, iron and steel,
coal and rest of the economy, reflecting less mechanization (lower capital shares) than
England. Labor, capital and rent shares in agriculture, tropical raw materials and tropical food
are set at 40:20:40 as in England agriculture.
Imports: Imports from England are based on Davis export data for England to the rest of the
world. Imports from North America are assumed to be England’s reexports to rest of the
world.
Exports: Exports to England are based on Davis import data for England from the rest of the
world. Exports to North America are assumed to be England’s reexports to North America.
Consumption: We assume the Rest of the World total consumption expenditure is £13,118,
given by England’s consumption times 50, minus North America’s consumption. This ratio is
based on a world population of 770 million versus England and Wales 7 million and Scotland

20

1.26 m (Clark, 2007, 139, Mitchell and Deane, 1971, 5). We assume the Rest of the World
living standards were approximately 50% of England levels based on Clark 2007, 40–70.
We assume consumption weights in the rest of the world are different as follows: cotton
textiles 3%, other textiles 3%, iron and steel as England, coal as needed to absorb imports,
agriculture 37.5%, tropical raw materials 0%, tropical food 37.5%, and the balance for rest of
the economy. This is to reflect the Engel curves which show foodstuffs at higher levels of
consumption when incomes are lower.
Total final use: For each sector, consumption plus exports minus imports.
North America and Caribbean, 1760
Production: In each sector, output is total final use minus imports plus intermediate use. Coal
output and input use is set to zero (forcing imports to go to consumption). All intermediate
input shares are as in England, except coal is replaced by lumber (agriculture). Labor and
capital shares are assumed at 70:30 for cotton textiles, other textiles, iron and steel, and for
the rest of the economy, reflecting lower mechanization levels than England. Labor, capital
and rent shares in agriculture, tropical raw materials and tropical food are set at 40:20:40 as
in English agriculture.
Imports: Imports from England are based on Davis export data for England to North America.
Imports from the rest of the world are assumed to equal England reexports to North America.
Exports: Exports to England are based on Davis import data for England from North America.
Exports to the rest of the world are assumed to equal England re-exports to the rest of the
world.
Consumption: Assume North America total consumption expenditure is assumed as £91,
given by England consumption times 1. This ratio is based on an assumed North
America:England population ratio of 1 based on the various population estimates for the
Americas in Mitchell 2003. We assume homothetic identical preferences in England and
North America.
Total final use: For each sector, consumption plus exports minus imports.
