Could simple rules (which are already used by some journals) like the desk rejection of a significant minority of papers, help to streamline the process?  At what cost? How well do journals seem to do in choosing papers? What can we say about the extent of type 1 and type 2 errors? Do editors seem to have uniform standards or are some harsher than others? We use data on submissions to the Journal of International Economics to help answer these questions.\n\n",
