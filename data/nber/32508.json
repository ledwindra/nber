    "abstract": "\n\nReducing gender-specific commuting barriers in developing countries has complex and diverse effects on women\u2019s labor dynamics. We study a program that offers free bus rides for women in several Indian states (the Pink Slip program) using a synthetic difference-in-differences approach to shed light on labor supply and time use decisions of women. We observe decreased bus expenses and time saved on travel. Skilled employed women increase labor supply, while low-skill married women shift focus to household chores. Unemployed women intensify job searches, yet overall employment rates remain unchanged. Our findings highlight that alleviating commuting costs does not uniformly boost women\u2019s labor participation, as gender roles and societal norms continue to shape outcomes.\n\n",
