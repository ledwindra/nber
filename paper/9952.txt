JEL No. I0, K4
ABSTRACT
The purpose of this paper is to examine the effectiveness of mental health and substance
abuse treatment in reducing crimes committed by juveniles. The observed high correlations between
crime, substance abuse and poor mental health suggests that factors which reduce substance abuse
and improve mental health may also be effective in reducing criminal activities. This paper uses
detention data in conjunction with substance abuse and mental health treatment data for youth
enrolled in the Colorado state foster care program. We analyze the impact of treatment in delaying
or preventing this group of at-risk youth from engaging in criminal behavior. Results show a
negative effect, i.e., longer duration before detention, for youth who receive treatment and for youth
in areas with high treatment rates.

1. INTRODUCTION
Criminal behaviors are highly prevalent among adolescents. In 2000, teenagers aged 13
to 19 accounted for 10 percent of the population, but 25.8 percent of all arrests, 23.8 percent of
arrests for violent crime, and 40 percent of arrests for property crime (FBI, 2000). There is a
large body of literature examining the determinants of juvenile crime, which concludes that
factors such as gender, education, socio-economic status, and family environment are all strong
correlates of criminal behavior. Two factors, substance abuse and mental illness, have received
less attention in the crime literature, but are also potentially important. This paper examines the
effectiveness of mental health and substance abuse treatment in reducing crimes committed by
juveniles.
A number of studies have shown that youth with substance abuse or mental health
disorders consistently have higher offending rates than those without disorders (Elliott and
Huizinga, 1984; Elliott and Huizinga, 1989; Elliott et al.,1989; Elliott et al.,1986). For example,
Vander Stoep et al. (1997) show that youth enrolled in a public mental health system had three
times as many police referrals to the juvenile justice system as those in the general child
population. Others have shown higher rates of violence and aggression among youth with
mental health problems (Ellickson et al.,1997; Arseneault et al.,2000). Some evidence suggests
that mental illness contributes in part to youths’ illegal behavior (Loeber et al.,1998; Lynam,
1996; Loeber et al., 2000; Link and Stueve, 1995).
Similarly, a number of studies have shown that children in the juvenile justice system
experience substantially higher rates of mental health and substance abuse disorders than youth
in the general population (Garland et al.,2001; Randall et al.,1999; Myers et al.,1990;
Wasserman et al., 2002; Friedman et al., 1996). For example, Wasserman et al. (2002) studied

past-month mental health diagnoses among a group of male youth in secure placement facilities
and found expectably high rates of disruptive diagnoses (33 percent), but also high rates of
substance abuse diagnoses (50 percent), anxiety disorders (20 percent) and mood disorders (10
percent). By comparison, estimates for youth ages 18 and under from the nationally
representative National Comorbidity Survey show a much lower past year prevalence of
substance abuse disorders (11 percent), but similar rates of anxiety disorders (25 percent) and
mood disorders (13 percent). The use of different instruments and survey time frames across
studies makes comparisons difficult, but a review of impairment studies among general
population youth reported the median rate of any disorder to be 15 percent (Roberts, et al., 1998).
Studies of substance abuse and crime, whether violent or nonviolent, show a strong
positive relationship (see Miczek et al.,1994, and Forrest and Gordon, 1990 for reviews of the
literature). Regarding violent crime, the Bureau of Justice Statistics (1998) states that a higher
proportion of violent male inmates in local jails report drinking at the time of the offense than
property crime inmates. Among all state prisoners under the influence of alcohol at the time of
the offence (about 33% of prisoners), the average blood alcohol content (BAC) is 0.27, which is
almost 3 times that of the legal limit for driving under the influence. In comparison, the average
BAC for intoxicated drivers involved in fatal accidents is about 0.17 (BJS 1998). Other studies
comparing violent and non-violent criminals also find high rates of alcohol use among violent
offenders (Roslund and Larson, 1979; Myers, 1982; Myers, 1986).
In considering violence by youths, Rossow et al. (1999) and Bernburg and Thorlindsson
(1999) show that when violence is measured as a specific act, such as beating or threatening to
beat someone or having been in a fight with a weapon, frequent intoxication will lead to
increased violence, as will the use of marijuana or other drugs. Salts and Lindholm (1995) find

2

that alcohol and marijuana use are highly correlated with increased violent behaviors in both
black and white adolescent males. Similar findings hold for teens of both genders when
examining drug use and violence in school (Furlong et al., 1997).
It is important to note that the studies showing the high correlation between mental
illness, substance use, aggression, and crime do not establish causality. There could exist
unobserved individual, familial, or situational confounders driving these relationships (see Fagan
1990 for a review of the theories on intoxication and aggression). However, if having a mental
illness or substance abuse disorder causes crime, for example, due to aggression or lack of
impulse control, then targeting the disorder through health care treatment may reduce the
likelihood of subsequent offense and contact with the juvenile justice system. As a result,
increased availability of mental health and substance use treatment programs may be an effective
means by which to reduce crime. Among substance users, if consumption directly causes crime,
then another way to lower crime would be to lower consumption. Indeed, a number of studies
have shown that crime can be reduced by raising price of drugs or alcohol (Chaloupka and
Saffer, 1992; Cook and Moore, 1993; Markowitz, 2000; DeSimone, 2001; Markowitz, 2001).
Using data on a group of at-risk teenagers in the Colorado child welfare system, we
examine the effectiveness of mental health and substance abuse treatment in reducing juvenile
crimes. This study also focuses on the effectiveness of increased access to treatment for
substance abuse and mental illness and higher alcohol prices in reducing crime. As described in
detail below, we focus on improved access to treatment and higher alcohol prices since policy
makers can easily manipulate the demand for treatment and the demand for alcohol through
policy changes, for example, through changes in public health insurance programs or higher
excise taxes on alcohol.

3

Using duration models to examine the determinants of the time spent out of detention, we
find that mental health and substance abuse treatment reduce detention hazards for all offenses
and violent offenses, as do higher prices for alcohol. The effect of alcohol prices is particularly
strong among violent offenses. Increased availability of treatment services will also lower
detention hazards for all offences, but appear to have no effect on violent offenses.
The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the relevant literature. Section 3
addresses the data and methods used in the study, while Section 4 reports the results. We
conclude with Section 5.

2. RELEVANT LITERATURE
There has been very little research examining the effectiveness of mental health treatment
in preventing crime by youths, although one form of intensive treatment, multisystemic therapy
(MST), has been shown to have beneficial effects and reduce rates of subsequent arrests,
psychiatric symptomatology, and drug use for youth with serious antisocial behavior (Henggeler,
1994; Henggeler et al., 1996). The MST intervention provides highly coordinated and organized
services whereby therapists involve parents, teachers, and friends to focus on environmental
change. Although MST has been tested in randomized trials, thereby dealing with the problem
of sample selection, these studies have been limited to small study populations with serious
disorders in controlled environments. Broader effectiveness of less intensive mental health
services on youth crime has not been established.
There are however, a number of studies focusing on substance abuse treatment in
reducing crime, but this literature applies mostly to adults. There are a number of different kinds
of treatment programs for substance abuse, although most evaluation studies have focused on

4

four primary types: methadone maintenance, therapeutic communities, outpatient drug free
programs, and civil commitment programs. Methadone maintenance programs provide
methadone to drug-dependent individuals as an oral substitute for heroin. These types of
programs seem to be successful in reducing both drug consumption and crime (Anglin and Hser,
1990). For example, Hser et al. (1988) show that for heroin addicts, time spent involved in
property crimes decreased from 18 percent of the time when not in treatment to 11 percent
during treatment. Hunt et al. (1984) compared clients at a methadone maintenance clinic with
narcotic users who were not in treatment. They find that those in treatment are less involved in
burglary, robbery and drug dealing. Maddux and Desmond (1979) find that crime rates in San
Antonio, Texas decreased as methadone treatment rates increased, and that crime rates increased
when budget cutbacks forced the premature discharge of patients.
Therapeutic communities are residential drug and alcohol treatment facilities designed
with the goal of helping the individual maintain a drug-free lifestyle. Programs include
encounter group therapy, and education sessions. In a study of one such community, DeLeon et
al. (1979) tracked males who entered the Phoenix House program in 1970-1971, and found that
the percent arrested fell from 72 prior to treatment to 41 after treatment. DeLeon (1984) shows
similar reductions.
Outpatient drug-free programs, which provide counseling and training in social skills,
seem to be less effective in reducing crime than other types of programs. Hubbard et al.
(1984)report that the same proportion of clients engaged in illegal activities before and after
treatment.
In a more general study that does not focus on a specific treatment, Saffer et al. (2001)
look at the impact of state-level expenditures for drug treatment facilities on illicit drug

5

consumption and finds that higher levels of expenditures are associated with reduced drug use.
These expenditures include money spent on hospital facilities operated by state or local
governments, and payments to private facilities. Saffer (2001) examine the impact of state-level
expenditures for drug control activities on crime. Drug control activities include police, courts,
prosecution, public defense, education, and drug treatment. He finds that states which spend
more per capita on drug control activity have lower arrests, lower reported property damage and
fewer individuals selling drugs.
Jofre-Bonet and Sindelar (2002) also examine the impact of unspecified types of drug
treatment programs in reducing crimes. This study follows a sample of inner-city drug users
through treatment for drug and alcohol addiction, and relates the changes in drug use to changes
in income-generating crimes. They find that reductions in drug use are strongly related to
reduction in crime, and suggest that treatment which lowers drug use may be an effective tool for
reducing crime.
Finally, a number of researchers have examined the effectiveness of civil commitment
programs. Typically, a drug addict will be ordered by the court to complete one of these
programs as an alternative to prison. McGlothlin, et al. (1977) compared addicts who completed
a court ordered program to those addicts who did not complete the court ordered program.
Results show the former group reduced their criminal activity by 18.6 percent as compared to a
6.7 percent reduction by the latter group. Van Steel et al. (1994) look at recidivism to the
criminal justice system for criminals who entered Wisconson’s Treatment Alternative Program
(TAP) over a one year period. They find that offenders who completed TAP were less likely to
be rearrested during the follow-up period than offenders who did not complete TAP. Sealock et
al. (1997) use data from offending youths assigned to substance abuse treatment in a resident

6

facility in Maryland. Results show that youths in residential treatment facilities were no less
likely to be arrested during the follow-up period than those not receiving treatment. However,
the treatment youths remained arrest-free longer.
In short, substance abuse treatment programs appear to be effective in lowering crime.
However, the existing literature tends to focus on limited samples of adults or restricted
geographic areas. The studies primarily fall into two main types: those which look at rates of
criminal behavior by substance abusing individuals before and after treatment, and those
comparing a control group of criminals to a treatment group of criminals. One drawback to the
first type of study design is that it is difficult to attribute behavioral changes to the program or
the passage of time. Both types may also suffer from biases in sample selection, and the results
may not be applicable to a larger youth population.

3. Methods
3.1. Data
The above literature review suggests an empirical model where crime is determined in
part by drug and alcohol consumption and poor mental health. If treatment for substance abuse
or mental health problems is successful, then such treatment may also reduce criminal activities.
We test this hypothesis by estimating a model of crime for a group of at-risk teenagers who are
in the Colorado child welfare system (i.e. foster care). We then test a separate model for violent
crimes only. The child welfare population is an interesting and relevant population to study
because the majority of the children in foster care programs across the country come from
abusive or neglectful homes, and as a result, these children exhibit more chronic medical,
emotional, and psychological problems than other youth (DosReis et al. 2001). These children

7

are considered at-risk for criminal behaviors because of the link between mental health and
substance abuse problems and crime as discussed above.
Our sample consists of youth in the child welfare system over a three-year period. The
child welfare encounter data come from the Colorado Division of Child Welfare and contain
records for all youth who received child welfare services in Colorado between July 1994 and
June 1997. These data include date of entry, age, gender, race, ethnicity, and county of
residence. Our sample consists of youth between the ages of 13 and 18 who were in the child
welfare system or entered it during the study period.
Data on crime come from the Department of Youth Corrections (DYC), which collects
information on all youths who are detained. Crime in this study is measured by youth who are
arrested and specifically detained by the Colorado Division of Youth Corrections. Their cases
are not necessarily adjudicated and may not lead to sanctions. Therefore, our measure of crime
is more restrictive than arrests, but less restrictive than sanctioning or commitment. The DYC
data contain date of detention and release, as well as offense type. A wide range of offenses is
recorded in the system, including violent crimes, property crimes, drug crimes, sex crimes, minor
crimes, and status offenses. We exclude detentions due to status offenses. For analyses of
violent crime, we use detentions for murder, rape, assault, and robbery offenses. In our sample,
20.1 percent of youths are detained by the department of corrections at least once during the
three-year sample period, and 3.2 percent are detained for violent offenses. When an individual
was observed to have multiple detentions, only the initial spell up to the first detention was
included in the analysis. Consequently, we do not address the issue of recidivism in this study.
Children in foster care are entitled to benefits under Medicaid, and these benefits include
treatment for substance abuse and mental health problems. Medicaid claims and encounter data

8

provide the information on mental health and substance abuse treatment for the teenagers in our
sample.1 These data include dates of treatment service and treatment type. Treatment type
includes outpatient treatment (including individual and group therapy, crisis and evaluative
services, case management, day treatment programs) and services in therapeutic residential
treatment facilities.
All datasets contain individual-level, encrypted identifiers. Teenagers in the child
welfare system during the study period were matched to their Medicaid and detention records
using the identifiers. The sample is composed of 6,073 youth. The mean characteristics of the
sample are shown in Table I.
3.2. Measures
Dependent Variable. Our dependent variables are indicators for whether a youth was
detained for any offense and whether a youth was detained for a violent offense only. Data for
each individual are aggregated to monthly discrete observations. Consequently, the detention
variable takes on a value of 1 if that individual was detained in the respective month and zero if
not. Similarly, we aggregate detention for violent offenses by month. Individuals are assumed
to occupy only two states, detention-free and detained. The transition rate from one state to the
other is the probability of leaving the detention-free state at any time period, given that the
individual is not detained up to that time period.

1

Services that are reimbursed through the state’s behavioral health managed care contracts are reported

using “encounter data,” while services reimbursed under fee-for-service contracts are reported using claims. The
Medicaid encounter and claims data were analyzed over a year after the state submission deadline, allowing time for
delayed records to be processed.

9

Key Independent Variables. The provision of mental health and substance abuse
treatment is our primary explanatory variable of interest. Treatment is defined as equal to one if
the individual was treated in a given month and zero otherwise. Treatment includes outpatient
treatment or treatment in a therapeutic residential treatment facility. Any youth hospitalized as
an inpatient (in acute, general and psychiatric hospitals or state mental hospitals) is considered
censored at the time of admission as they are not at risk of being detained while in the hospital.
None of the treatment visits recorded in this data results from a court-ordered sentence.
Estimating this model will show the propensity of treatment to reduce crime, although a
problem will arise if the decision to receive mental health or substance abuse treatment is
influenced by the same individual characteristics as the decision to commit a crime. In this case,
treatment will be endogenous and its coefficient will be biased. In order to correct for this
potential endogeneity, we use an estimation strategy which accounts for unobserved individual
heterogeneity (described below).
A second method of avoiding the problems associated with the endogeneity of treatment
is to estimate a model of crime that substitutes for treatment those variables that are correlated
with treatment, but not crime directly. This is in the same spirit as the crime and substance use
papers by Cook and Moore (1993) and DeSimone (2001) that relate the prices of drugs and
alcohol directly to crime. In our case, ideally the price of treatment would serve as such a
variable given that a number of studies have shown that the demand for mental health and
substance abuse services is responsive to price (Frank and McGuire 2000). However, since all
children in foster care are eligible for Medicaid, the monetary price of treatment faced by each
individual is zero and does not vary. Instead, we use a measure of the full price of treatment,
which includes travel and waiting times. This can be represented by county-level treatment

10

rates, calculated as the proportion of the sample treated in the given month, that capture the
supply of treatment available. We expect that as county treatment rates rise, the full price of
treatment falls.2
In a model where crime is determined in part by alcohol consumption, treatment may not
be the only determinant of alcohol consumption. A number of studies have shown that the
consumption of alcohol varies with its price (Leung and Phelps, 1993; Cook and Moore, 2000).
We include the price of beer in all models to gauge the effectiveness of higher beer prices in
reducing crime, holding treatment constant. Beer prices are available for a number of different
cities across Colorado. These data are published quarterly from the American Chamber of
Commerce Research Association. Each individual in the sample is assigned a beer price based
on the county of residence.
Control Variables. Explanatory variables that do not change over time include
demographic variables. Age by category (age 13 to 14, age 15 to 16, and 17 or older) is defined
as the age when the individual is first observed, that is, at entry into the child welfare system.
We also control for race (whether the individual is white, black, with other races as the omitted
category) and for whether the individual is Hispanic or not.

3.3. Estimation Strategy
Duration models are used to examine the structural determinants of detention. These
models analyze the decision to make a transition from one discrete state to another. We estimate

2

Treatment rates are calculated based on the entire sample of youth, not just those detained by the

department of Youth Corrections. The county rate serves as a valid measure of availability of services since it is
unlikely that any one individual’s behavior will influence the county treatment rate.

11

the conditional probability that an individual observed in the first period (month) will be detained
in a subsequent period (month). In particular, we estimate the extent to which characteristics of
the individual, alcohol prices, and treatment affect the length of time spent detention-free.
Therefore, these methods will quantify the impact of changes in the determinants of detention on
the conditional probability of being detained. The starting hazard rate is the probability of being
detained in period t, conditional on not being detained prior to t. The starting hazard should rise
and fall over time in response to different stimuli. In particular, the results will show how
changes in prices of alcohol and the provision of treatment affect length of time an individual
remains detention-free.
We model duration using several specifications. The unit of analysis is a spell, which
may be right-censored. Right-censoring occurs if we do not observe an individual being
detained during the study period, if the youth is treated as an inpatient in a hospital, or turns 18.
Within each spell we observe from 1 to 36 spell months. Conditional exit probabilities in each
spell month depend on observed fixed and time-varying covariates. We use maximum likelihood
estimation whereby the log likelihood is given by Eq. (1):
(1)

n
log L = ∑ {yi log h( Xi ) + (1 − yi ) log[1 − H ( Xi )]},
i=1

where yit is an indicator variable equal to one if person i exits the state during the interval [t-1,t],
h(.) is the density function and H(.) is the cumulative distribution function. The first term is the
contribution of an individual who is detained during the study period and the second term is the
contribution of an individual who is not detained.

12

We use a semi-parametric estimation procedure, the complementary log-log specification
of Prentice and Gloeckler (1978).3 This is a semi-parametric model, where we estimate a fully
non-parametric baseline hazard with a separate parameter for each duration interval. That is, we
assume the form of the baseline hazard is a step function with a step at each interval. Unlike a
parametric approach, such as a Weibull specification, in this method it is unnecessary to make
parametric assumptions concerning the hazard’s time dependency that can lead to inconsistent
coefficient estimates if the parameterization fits the data badly.
In addition, we estimate a model that incorporates unmeasured heterogeneity, also called
frailty. Unmeasured heterogeneity leads to overstated duration dependence (i.e., underestimates
of the extent to which the hazard rate increases with duration) and attenuates the magnitude of
the impact of covariates on the hazard rate (Lancaster, 1990; Kiefer, 1988). Without accounting
for unobserved heterogeneity, the results may be biased. We incorporate a gamma mixing
distribution to capture unobserved heterogeneity as proposed by Meyer (1990).
4. RESULTS
Table II presents the effect of treatment, beer prices and other covariates on the duration
hazard. The result table shows exponentiated coefficients or hazard ratios. Values greater than
one indicate that the covariate increases the exit probability (increase the likelihood of being
detained) while values less than one decrease the exit probability. Column 1 shows that black
youth have significantly higher probabilities of exiting into detention (i.e., their detention-free
spells are shorter) than other races, as do Hispanic youth and youth who are older. In addition,
males have higher exit probabilities than females. The demographic patterns are consistent with
evidence from FBI arrest data (Snyder, 1998). The key policy variables in this analysis also

13

behave as predicted. Youth who receive mental health or substance abuse treatment have
significantly lower probabilities of exiting into detention (i.e., their spells are longer). Receiving
treatment is associated with a 72 percent decline in the detention hazard. Beer prices also have
significant, negative effects on exit into detention, lowering the hazard by 42 percent for every
dollar increase in the beer price. Note that a dollar increase in the price of a six-pack of beer
represents a 24 percent increase in the average price.
Column 2 uses county treatment rates, the proxy for price of treatment, rather than
individual treatment. Coefficients on the demographic variables are similar to Column 1. The
hazard rate is less than one and is statistically significant. This implies that youth in counties
with higher treatment rates have lower conditional exit probabilities consistent with the
theoretical model’s prediction that increased availability of treatment improves access and
lowers crime. The coefficient on beer prices remains statistically significant and implies a lower
probability of exit (a longer period detention free).
Columns 3 and 4 of Table II present estimates from models that incorporate unmeasured
heterogeneity. We compare the models with and without heterogeneity terms by testing the
significance of the variance parameter in the gamma distribution and by the likelihood ratio test.
We find that introducing the heterogeneity terms improves the model fit. The estimated Gamma
variance has a t-value of 5.17 (p-value <0.01) and 4.53 (p-value <0.01) in each model, while the
likelihood ratio statistic for testing the models is 38.05 (χ2<0.01) and 28.01 respectively
(χ2<0.01).
The magnitude of the effect of individual treatment is slightly greater in the model with
heterogeneity. Having received treatment lowers the hazard by 75 percent. Omitting the
heterogeneity terms leads to attenuation of the treatment effect. The demographic patterns are

14

similar in the two models. Results that including unobserved heterogeneity show that males and
youth of older ages have higher detention exit rates. In both models, beer prices reduce the
detention hazard.
Similarly, in column 4, when accounting for unobserved heterogeneity, treatment rates
and beer prices both are statistically significant and lower the probability of exit into detention.
In all four of the above models, the coefficients on the duration dummy variables (not shown)
indicate that the pattern of variation of the baseline hazard with duration is not monotonic.
The effect of covariates on the hazard of detention for a violent offense are reported in
Table III. We find that receipt of treatment has statistically significant attenuating effect on
detention hazards (column 1), while beer prices have a larger effect than in previous models.
Treatment is associated with a 75 percent decline in the hazard, while a dollar increase in beer
prices is associated with an 82 percent decline. In contrast to previous models, in models of
violent offenses only, the effect of treatment rates is no longer significant (column 2). The effect
of beer prices remains statistically significant in column 2.
As for all offences, we find that introducing the heterogeneity term improves the model
fit of violent offences. The estimated Gamma variance has a t-value of 2.83 (p-value <0.01) and
2.45 (p-value <0.01) in each model, while the likelihood ratio statistic for testing the models is
13.04 (χ2<0.01) and 9.07 respectively (χ2<0.01). Models of detention for violent offenses that
incorporate unmeasured heterogeneity also show negative effects of mental health and substance
treatment and beer prices on the detention hazard for violent offenses (column 3). In contrast to
models of all offense types models, the effect of county treatment rates is not significant for
violent offenses, although the effect of beer prices remains negative and significant (column 4).

5. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
This study examines the effectiveness of mental health and substance abuse treatment in
reducing detention rates for juveniles in the Colorado child welfare system. This is a important
group of youth to study since they are particularly at risk for engaging in criminal behaviors.
The majority of the children in foster care programs across the country come from abusive
homes and as a result, these children exhibit more chronic medical, emotional, and psychological
problems than other youth. Indeed, our analysis shows high detention rates among this group.
Consistent with other youth studies we also find that among youth in child welfare those who are
male, black, Hispanic and older were likely to be detained earlier than other youth.
Using duration analyses, we find that substance abuse and mental health treatment can be
used effectively to delay or prevent youth detention. Specifically, the analysis finds that
individuals who receive treatment have lower probabilities of being detained for any offence.
Similarly, those youth who live in areas with a greater supply of treatment services also have a
lower probability of exiting into detention. Accounting for the unobserved heterogeneity makes
the magnitude of these effects larger. Also consistent with our theory, higher beer prices lower
the detention hazard.
In examining the determinants of detention for violent offences, we show that individuals
who receive treatment have lower probabilities of being detained, however, the supply of
treatment in the area does not impact the length of time out of detention. The effect of higher
beer prices is negative and particularly strong. Given the often cited high correlation between
alcohol use and aggression, this last result is not surprising and implies that higher beer prices
will reduce both consumption and violent criminal behaviors.

16

The results of out study are limited by the fact that we can not identify the effectiveness
of specific mental health or substance abuse treatment components. In addition, the analysis is
conducted on a specialized sample of foster care youth in Colorado and results may not be
generalizable. However, this group has a high rate of criminal involvement and may be
relatively easy to target for public policies because they are already in a public system. Results
of this study suggest that expansion of health services targeted at these youth may be effective at
reducing crime. For violent crime, where the literature shows that substance abuse plays a
significant role, stricter alcohol-regulatory policies may also be highly effective.
