             FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT IN THE U.S.:
                 CHANGES OVER THREE DECADES




                                 ABSTRACT


        U.S. direct investment inflows in the 1980s were almost half the
world's total. Even this large inflow leaves foreign firms employing less than
5 per cent of the U.S. labor force, but twice that share in manufacturing. That
increase is related to the internationalization of production by foreign firms
more than to competitive weakness of U.S. firms.
        Foreign affiliates import more relative to their exports than U.S. firms
but are moving closer to the behavior of U.S. firms. The trade balances of
both are sensitive to exchange rates.
        The financing of foreign direct investment from retained earnings
dropped almost to zero in the 1980s. One reason is the rapid growth of this
investment and another is its low profitability.

                           I. Historical Background

         It has been a characteristic of the foreign investment history of the

United States as far back as there is any statistical record, and probably earlier

also, that while inward investment was largely in portfolio form, outward

investment was mainly direct investment. That is, the outward investment

mostly involved control of foreign operations by U.S. firms, while the inward

investment took the form of lending by foreigners to government agencies or

enterprises that were controlled by Americans. The contrast between the two

sides of the investment balance sheet can be summarized in the Table 1, to the

extent that the historical record permits the distinction to be made.

         The individual figures here often rely on weak statistical foundations

and the fluctuations in the ratios should not be taken very seriously. For

example, the sharp rise in the share of direct investment in the U.S. outward

total between 1929 and 1935 to a large extent reflects the fact that, in the data

source, bond holdings were adjusted to market value in 1935 while direct

investments were not, although they too must have fallen substantially in

market value. The contrast between inward and outward investment is clear,

however. Direct investment was almost always more than half the outward

investment total but never more than a quarter of the inward investment.

         The large decline in the share of direct investment on the outward side

between 1919 and 1929 has had its counterpart in more recent years, as we

discuss later. That decline reflected a tremendous expansion in portfolio

lending, concentrated in Latin America to a much larger extent than ever

before. Much of that portfolio investment disappeared in defaults and price

depreciation during the 1930s.

         Since direct investment is a transfer more of technological or

management skills than of capital, it may seem surprising that there was so

little inflow into the United States during the 19th century, when several

European countries must have possessed superior technology and skills. One

explanation may be that the transfer of skills took a different form when

transportation and communication were so slow and primitive compared to that

in recent years. Because of the difficulty of controlling foreign enterprises

from a home base, much of the transfer of knowledge took the form of human

migration, either to establish enterprises in the United States or to manage

them after they were first established. Also, as Mira Wilkins (1989) points

out in her recent study of foreign investment in the United States before 1914,
                                      -4-
the distinction between direct and portfolio investment was not always a sharp

one. Even portfolio investors sometimes intervened in the management of

American firms when things went badly. And many of the earlier direct

investments in the United States were what she refers to as "free-standing"

enterprises, differing from most U.S. direct investment in recent years in that

they were owned by foreigners but not by foreign firms. They were not

subsidiaries of multinational firms, as is typical now, although they were

sometimes parts of loose networks trading with each other and sometimes

sharing expertise in technical fields. Such enterprises were probably much

more likely over time to turn into domestic U.S. firms with the migration of

their owners or adaptation to local conditions in the United States than are the

current subsidiaries of multinational enterprises.



        II. The Magnitude of Foreign Direct Investment in the U.S.

II.A. The U.S. Share in the World's Stocks and Flows

         The dominant role of the United States as a supplier of direct

investment to other countries before the 1970s is reflected in the fact that U.S.

outward investment accounted for over half of the developed world's stock of

direct investment in 1967 and 1971, with the next most important direct

investor, the U.K., owning only about 15-17 per cent, and no other single

country accounting for more than 6 per cent (UN, 1978, Table 111-32). On the

other side of the account, foreign direct investment in the United States was
                                      -5-
only 9 per cent of the world's total stock in 1967 and 11 per cent in 1975 (UN

1978, Table 111-33).

        The U.S. share of direct investment outflows since the late 1960s is

described in Table 2. It was well over half the developed country total in the

1960s, and stayed at or close to half through the 1970s. In the second half of

the 1970s the U.S. was still responsible for almost half the developed country

outflow and more than 40 per cent of that of the whole world. Then, in the

first half of the 1980s, direct investment from the U.S. fell to less than 20 per

cent of the world outflow, and by the latest period had gone below 15 per

cent.

           The opposite change took place on the inflow side. The direct

investment inflow to the United States was less than 10 per cent of the total

inflow to developed countries in 1960 and 1965-66, 17 per cent in 1967-69,

and jumped to about a quarter in 1973-75 and over a third in 1975-80. The

U.S. share of world inflows, only about 15 per cent in the early 1970s,

reached over a quarter in the late 1970s, almost 40 per cent in 198 1-85 and 46

per cent in 1985-89.

           The consequence of these declining U.S. shares of outflows and

increasing shares of inflows can be seen in the shares of direct investment

stocks. By 1988 the U.S. held 35 per cent of the world stock of outward

investment and 31 per cent of the stock of inward investment. The U.S. share

of outward investment would probably be considerably higher if either of the

alternative valuations discussed below were used, since the U.S. investments

are older than those of most other countries. And the U.S. share of inward

investment would be considerably smaller if the reporting of inward investment

by other countries were more complete.

           These figures by themselves seem to imply that the United States has

in recent years sharply cut back its former role as the major supplier of direct

investment capital to the rest of the world. It has, instead, apparently come

to absorb a very high proportion of the world's supply of direct investment

capital.

           While there is some truth to this summary, there are also some

questionable aspects to it. Since the U.S. was the leading foreign direct

investor in the early post-WWII decades, many of its holdings are well-

established foreign firms, and the further flow of U.S. direct investment

capital to foreign countries comes largely from the retained earnings of these

companies. While the U.S. reports these retained earnings as flows of direct

investment, many other countries do not, and the share of the U.S. in outflows

is therefore probably exaggerated. Since many other countries fail to report

the reinvested earnings in their inward investment accounts, the U.S. share on

the inward side is probably also overstated.

II.B. U.S. Inward and Outward Direct Investment Stocks and Flows

           Since the U.S. was much more of an exporter than an importer of

direct investment for many years, as described above, the stock of foreign
                                     -8-
direct investment in the U.S. was small compared to U.S. holdings abroad.

In 1950, for example, the inward stock was less than 30 per cent as large as

the outward stock, measured by book values, and in 1966, after the rapid

growth in U.S. outward direct investment, it was less than 20 per cent (Table

3). As foreign direct investment in the U.S. began to grow rapidly in the

years after 1977, the book value ratio rose, to the point where in 1990 the

foreign direct investment in the U.S. appeared about as large as the U.S.

direct investment abroad, a startling change in a little over a decade.

        As this near-reversal of the direct investment balance took place,

along with the widely publicized story that the U.S. had gone in a few years

from a major creditor position to being "the world's greatest debtor," a

number of observers expressed skepticism about the significance of the book

value data. These are basically historical cost valuations, but those for U.S.

direct investment abroad are affected by exchange rate changes, since many

book values are translated into U.S. dollars from foreign currencies using

current exchange rates. Since U.S. direct investment abroad was much older

on average than foreign investment in the U.S., it seemed likely that it had

been made at much lower than current prices and, for that and other reasons,

was greatly undervalued (Eisner and Pieper, 1990, Ulan and Dewald, 1989).

That impression was reinforced by the fact that foreign income from direct

investment in the U.S. was much smaller than U.S. income on direct

investment abroad, well under half in 1990, for example (Di Lullo, 1991,
                                     -9-

Table   5). In response to these doubts, the BEA undertook the calculation of

some alternative measures. One, referred to as the "current-cost" method is

based on a revaluation of tangible assets. The main feature is a revaluation of

plant and equipment using a perpetual inventory calculation from past
expenditures. Land and inventories are also revalued to a rough measure of

current prices. The "market-value" method is a revaluation of the equity part

of direct investment on the basis of movements in stock prices (Landefeld and

Lawson, 1991).'

          Two aspects of the story seem fairly clear. One is that foreign direct

investment in the U.S. is still considerably smaller than U.S. direct investment

abroad. The other is that the foreign investment in the U.S. grew much more



        Both of these adjustments are extremely crude. Even if they were

not, there is no reason to expect them to give similar results. In the case of

U. S. corporations, for which the data are far better, the "adjusted book

value," akin to the current value used here, ranged from more than 20 per

cent below to almost 90 per cent above the market value of the equity

derived from stock prices between 1929 and 1958 (Goldsmith and Lipsey,

1963, Vol. I, Table 25), and from 30 per cent below to more than twice as

high between 1954 and 1977 (Cagan and Lipsey, 1978, Table 2-3).
                                    — 11   —




rapidly than U.S. investment abroad after 1977, not only in percentage terms

but, by some measures, in dollar terms as well. Thus, as compared with the

1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, the U.S. was an exceptionally attractive location for

foreign companies in the 1980s relative to the attractiveness of foreign

locations for U.S. companies. This was the case despite the very high price

of U.S. assets during part of this period as the exchange value of the U.S.

dollar reached its peak in 1984, and early 1985. However, the period after

1977 also includes two periods of low exchange values of the dollar, one

around 1980 and one after 1985.

         While the expected effects of exchange rate changes on trade by

affiliates are clear, and are described below, the effects on investment flows

are ambiguous. For example, a high exchange value of the U.S. dollar makes

foreign production facilities more economical relative to those in the U.S., but

the incentive for a U.S. firm to invest in such facilities would be stronger if

the product were very tradable than if it were a service or a relatively

nontradable good. In addition the high value of the dollar would reduce the

price of a foreign facility in dollar terms, so that an increase in physical

investment might be offset by the decline in the dollar price of the foreign

assets and result in a decline in investment outflows denominated in dollars

unless there were a high elasticity of demand for productive assets, or a high

elasticity of substitution between U.S. and foreign assets.

II.C. Foreign-owned Firms' Shares of the U.S. Economy

         The rapid growth of foreign direct investment in the U.S. should be

compared with some measures of the size of the U.S. economy. By some

indicators, this comparison places the foreign operations in perspective as even

now a small part of the economy. One such measure is the ratio of the stock

of foreign direct investment to the assets of U.S. corporations (Table 4). The

stock of foreign direct investment looks small by this standard, but the rapid

growth after 1977 does stand out.

         If we confine our attention to the nonfinancial sector, foreign direct

investment appears more important. That is partly because foreign ownership

is less important in finance and partly because the finance sector's assets

include a large amount of holdings of the equity and debt of other sectors and

of the finance sector itself. There is much less duplication, in this sense, in

the nonfinancial sector's assets. The foreign share here more than doubled

between 1950 and 1980 or 1960 and 1980, and then much more than doubled

during the 1980s. Thus the growth of the foreign investment share accelerated

during the 1980s.

         In a sense, this comparison between foreign investment and assets is

a misleading one because the numerator and denominator are different

concepts. More appropriate comparisons might be for shares of output or

shares of inputs into production, such as labor or capital, but these are more

limited in their time spans.

         A calculation of the share of U.S. manufacturing industry assets under

foreign control in 1980 and 1988 was made by Orr (1991). As part of the

calculation he estimated what the foreign share of motor vehicle industry assets

would be if Japanese-owned auto production operations, listed under the

wholesale trade industry in the Department of Commerce data, were

transferred to the manufacturing category. An affiliate would be listed in

wholesale trade in the official data if its wholesale trade activities were larger

than the manufacturing activity. Since value of sales, rather than value added,

is the criterion, the method tends to put into wholesale trade affiliates that

would be in manufacturing by a value added or employment criterion because

ratios of sales to value added or employment added are much larger in

wholesale trade than in manufacturing. On's estimates for the foreign share

in manufacturing assets were (per cent):

                      1980     8.5

                      1988 14.3

Even with the estimated motor vehicle industry assets added, the shares in the

transportation equipment industry, 4.4 per cent in 1980 and 5.9 per cent in

1988, were well below the average for manufacturing.

        A comparison of gross product, excluding banks, suggests something

less than a doubling of the foreign share in U.S. output between 1977 and

1987,

somewhat slower than that indicated by the direct investment data. Another

comparison, this time on the input side, for employment (Table 5), shows that

the levels are fairly small, but the growth has been rapid: the ratio tripled

between 1974 and 1989.

         The employment shares of foreign firms vary greatly among sectors:

they are much higher in goods production, particularly mining and
manufacturing than in service sectors (Table 6). The sector ratios are subject

to the problem that establishments are classified differently in the two sources.

The aggregate U.S. data are classified by industry of establishment while the

data for foreign affiliates are consolidated into a total for all affiliates of a

single firm and classified by the predominant industry. The most likely effect

is to move trade and service operations into manufacturing, although some

manufacturing operations, such as Japanese auto plants, may be classified

under wholesale trade because the distribution activities related to importing

may be so large. The mining share is almost certainly exaggerated by the

inclusion of petroleum distribution operations with the refining activities of

foreign-owned petroleum companies.

         The development that has been drawn the most public comment is the

growth of the foreign share in manufacturing, from minor levels in 1974 to

over 10 per cent of employment in 1989. What is equally notable is the

pervasiveness of the growth in foreign shares, which more than doubled in

every broad industry group shown here. While this growth is often viewed

from the U.S. perspective as a sign of American weakness, it was also a part

of a general move toward internationalization of production by firms all around

the world, in which foreign firms began to imitate the internationalization that

large American firms pioneered in the 1950s and 1960s (Lipsey, 1989). Even

at the end of the period, the foreign share in U.S. manufacturing employment

was not high compared to that in most developed countries except Japan and

the Nordic countries.

         The growth in the foreign share of U.S. manufacturing employment

has affected all the main groups within the manufacturing sector, but it has

gone much further in some groups than in others (Table 7). Over the whole

period, the foreign share of employment in chemicals has been much higher

than that in any other industry group, a surprising fact in view of the strong

position of American chemical companies in world trade. In fact, the foreign

shares among these industry groups do not seem to bear any relation to the

competitive strength of American companies; they are no higher in the groups

in which American firms are relatively weak, such as foods, metals, and

miscellaneous manufactures, than in industries where U.S. firms hold strong

positions, such as chemicals and machinery. It may be that the foreign shares

are high in chemicals and machinery because the nature of these industries

leads firms from all countries to be multinational, and that it would be higher

if U.S. firms were not strong in these fields.

         Two points should be made about particular industries. The fact that

the foreign share is so low in transport equipment and has not risen since

1980, although it clearly did increase before that, reflects two factors. One

is the lack of foreign ownership in the aircraft industry. That may partly

reflect the connection with national defense, but the international dominance

of U.S. firms must also be a factor. A second reason for the low share,

especially in view of the failure of the share to rise after 1980, may be a

classification scheme that places some manufacturing employment by foreign

car producers under wholesale trade because that is the predominant activity

of the U.S. subsidiaries.

        The high foreign share in chemicals probably reflects the
characterization of DuPont as foreign-owned although it is not owned by a

foreign chemical company and is not part of a foreign-based chemicals

network. It is different in this respect from other foreign-owned chemical

operations, such as the Swiss-owned pharmaceutical firms and Hoechst-

Celanese. The inclusion of DuPont, if it is included, has a major effect: it

would probably account for something in the neighborhood of 100,000
                                    - 21   -

employees out of the reported 443,000. If all of DuPont, including petroleum

operations, is combined into this chemicals group, the degree of exaggeration

is increased by the fact that employees in the petroleum operations are in the

numerator, but not in the denominator of the fraction. However even without

DuPont, chemicals would still be the industry group with the largest foreign

share, by a large margin.

        The large role of foreign firms in the chemical industry has long

historical roots, based on foreign, particularly German, companies' early lead

in chemical technologies. Mira Wilkins (1989) reported that "Foreign direct

investment had more impact on the pre-Worid War I American chemical

industry than on any other U.S. industry.. .in no other industry were

Europeans so far in advance of Americans; in no other single industry was the

foreign technological contribution so dramatic." (p. 383) and that "... by 1914

few branches of the U.S. chemical industry were untouched by foreign direct

investment. No other American industry was as influenced by European

business enterprises" (p. 411). "In the pre-war chemical and dye industries,

German interests were supreme" according to Lewis (1938, p. 102).

        That large foreign, particularly German, role persisted despite the

confiscation and sale to Americans of German patents and property by the

Alien Property Custodian during World War I and a second round of

confiscations during and after World War II. Among the German holdings

before World War I, according to Wilkins (1989, Chapter 11), were Rohm
                                     - 22   -
and    Hans, Heyden Chemical, Merck & Co., Hoechst, and Bayer. During

World War II, the Alien Property Custodian vested $51.4 million in enemy-

owned property, mostly German, that included American Potash and Chemical

Corp. and General Aniline and Film Corp. (U.S. Dept. of Commerce, 1948,

pp. 93 and 99),    and   in the years after World War II, vested another $58

million, part of which consisted of "...two large rayon manufacturing

companies..." (U.S. Dept. of Commerce, 1950, pp. 130-13 1 and 160).

          In 1989, almost a quarter of foreign firms' employment in chemicals

(even with DuPont's employment included, if it is; almost 30 per cent if we

assume it is included and remove it) was in German-controlled firms. These

firms must possess some strong and persistent technological advantages to

retain their position in the U.S. and to keep regaining it after it has been cut

off.

          Another view of the changing importance of foreign-owned affiliates

in U.S. manufacturing is provided by shares in plant and equipment

expenditures. While the employment measure in a sense overweights labor

intensive activities, the plant and equipment measure gives a high weight to

capital intensive activities and, possibly, to relatively new operations. The

foreign affiliate shares may be exaggerated by the inclusion of intra-company

transfers of plant and equipment that would not enter the denominator.

          Since 1974, the foreign share in manufacturing plant and equipment

expenditure appears to have multiplied greatly (Table 8).

         In several respects, the capital expenditure data confirm the story in

the employment data. The trend in the foreign share was very strongly

upward, although not quite as steep. The rise in the importance of the foreign

firms was evident in all the industry groups. The role of foreign-owned firms

was highest in chemicals throughout the period. In general, the foreign role

is greater in capital expenditures than in employment, but foods and electrical

machinery were exceptions in this regard. In the case of the chemicals

industry, the possible inclusion of DuPont in the 1987 and 1989 data could be

a major part of the high ratios. In 1989, for example, DuPont reported over

$3 billion in plant and equipment expenditures in the United States (Annual

Report, p. 49), a third of the more than $9 billion for all chemical affiliates

of foreign companies in Appendix Table 12. DuPont reported $600 million

of capital expenditures in oil and gas operations in the U. S. that year, but

some may have been expensed, and therefore not included in the capital

expenditure figures.



         III. Foreign-Owned Affiliates in the U.S. and U.S. Trade

III. A. The Role of Foreign-owned Affiliates in U.S. Exports and Imports

        By the end of the 1980s, foreign-owned affiliates had come to play

a large role in U.S. merchandise trade. They exported $84 billion in goods

from the United States and imported $170 billion, 23 per cent of U.S. exports

and over a third of imports. These amounts seem very large relative to the
                                    - 25 -

shares   of foreign firms in U.S. production or employment, but they are so

large because much of these finns' export and import activity is as

intermediaries, trading in goods produced by other firms, not necessarily

foreign. More than half of the foreign firms' exports, for example, are by

foreign trading firms, classified as wholesale trade affiliates. They deal in

metals and minerals, and in farm products and other raw materials. The

former group is mainly Japanese and the latter is split between Japanese and

French affiliates. In neither group is it likely that much of the exports come

from the foreign firms' own production. One might guess that while the

foreign firms' intermediation provides some gains in efficiency, the exports

would not change greatly if these trading operations were closed. On the other

hand, the exports by wholesale affiliates in motor vehicles and machinery,

mainly Japanese, could have been the output of manufacturing operations by

the same firms in the U.S.

          Imports by foreign-owned wholesalers are mostly of manufactured

products that would probably be imported anyway. The importation via

affiliates is presumably more efficient for the foreign manufacturers and

probably adds to their profits or their market shares.

          If we assume that the exports and imports of manufacturing affiliates

are more related to their own production activities than are those of trade

affiliates, the trade of the manufacturing affiliates may be more likely to

reflect the effects of the direct investment. The amounts are still large, $31
                                    -26-
billion of exports and $39 billion of imports by manufacturing affiliates in

1989 (U.S. Dept. of Commerce, 1991c, Tables G-5 and G-6). The exports

were 10 1/2 per cent of our rough estimate of exports produced by the

manufacturing sector, and 12 1/2 per cent of all exports in SITC groups 4

through 9. Not all of the trade by manufacturing affiliates is of manufactured

products, but the 1987 data (U.S. Dept. of Commerce 1990, Tables G-10 and

G-16) suggest that only about 5 per cent of exports and between 5 and 10 per

cent of imports are crude materials and fuels.

         One contentious topic with respect to foreign firms' operations has

been their impact, if any, on U.S. trade. A suspicion is often expressed,

echoing earlier complaints against U.S. operations in Canada, for example,

that foreign-owned firms are disinclined to export, but have much higher

propensities to import than U.S. firms do.        It is not clear that such
propensities, if they existed, would have any implications for U.S. trade in

general, but we can ask whether the foreign operations are very distinctive in

their trade behavior.

        It is true that foreign-owned manufacturing operations export more

than they import. At the earliest date for which we have data, 1974, their

exports were about two-thirds of their imports; by 1989, exports were 80 per

cent of imports.

         The trade behavior of the foreign affiliates should be viewed against

the changes that took place in these years in U.S. trade as a whole. In 1974,

U.S. exports and imports, other than those of foreign-owned affiliates, were

equal. There was a strong downward trend in           the export/import ratio,

however, until by 1989 it was a little lower than the ratio for foreign

manufacturing affiliates. Thus, to the extent that the data for non-affiliates

reflects the general macroeconomic circumstances of the United States, exports

from the United States by foreign affiliates were facing unfavorable conditions.


III.B. Changing exchange rates and the trade of foreign-owned U.S. firms

         One possible explanation for the change in foreign affiliate

export/import ratios is that the foreign affiliates have in some sense "grown

up" and have become less dependent on their parent companies for supplies

and components. That may be the case, but there are reasons to be skeptical.

One is that foreign direct investment in the U.S. has been growing so fast that

the average age of the foreign-owned enterprises is probably not rising.
                                          - 28 -

Another is that the time pattern suggests the influence of another factor: the

U.S. exchange rate. The export/import ratio was highest in 1982, after the

low point in the exchange value of the dollar, and the ratio        was   at a low point

in 1986, after the peak in the value of the U.S. dollar. That influence of the

exchange rate is at least mildly confirmed by equation 1, which relates the

export/import ratio to the effective exchange rate of the dollar, lagged one

year, and a time trend.

where    EXAFF = Affiliate exports X 100
         IMAFF = Affiliate imports

                the Federal Reserve Bulletin

The time trend is not significant, but it is positive, as we would expect from

any maturing of the investments. The coefficient of the effective exchange

rate variable is negative, as we expect, and statistically significant, as it would

be if a high price of the dollar discouraged exports by these affiliates and

encouraged imports by them.

         If we suspect some J-curve effects on the import side, we might

include both current and lagged exchange rate changes, as in equation 2.

                                        - 29 -

The use of both current and lagged effective exchange rates greatly improves

the explanation of the changes in affiliate export/import ratios and suggests that

both current and lagged responses to exchange rates are important. This

evidence fits with the finding in Lipsey (1991) that foreign affiliates

exports/sales ratios to a large degree and imports/sales ratios to a small

degree, respond to effective exchange rate changes.

         The movements of the effective exchange rate over this period,

together with a time trend term, explain the export/import ratio of the U.S.,

other than foreign affiliates, to a far greater degree than they do the affiliate

trade ratios, as can be seen in equation 3.

(3) (USEX =          35.70    - 4.00 EERt..l -       .017 YR           = .897
      USIM           (6.75)    (5.96)            (6.49)

            where USEX = U.S. exports of merchandise minus exports by
                         foreign affiliates in the U.S.

                     USIM = U.S. imports of merchandise minus imports by
                               foreign affiliates.

The effective exchange rate coefficient is about the same for foreign affiliates'

trade (in equation 1) and for other U.S. trade (in equation 3), but the trends

are very different; the U.S. trade ratio has a strong downward trend over this

period. If we add the current exchange rate to the lagged exchange rate of

equation 3 we fmd that the current rate has the expected negative coefficient,

but it is not statistically significant. It does, however, improve the fit of the

equation slightly.

                                                        2 =.901
         The ratio for non-affiliate U.S. trade, incorporating the effect of

lagged exchange rate changes in combination with a trend term, goes a

considerable way towards explaining the trade ratio for affiliates (equation 5).


(5) EXAFF =           -62.9   + 1.33 USE + .032 YR

                                                       2
In this case the time trend is again positive, implying that given the factors

affecting non-affiliate trade, or U.S. trade in general, the trade ratio for

affiliates was rising; the trend for affiliates was toward typical U.S. behavior.

         A stronger explanation of the affiliate trade ratio is achieved by

adding the contemporary exchange rate to equation 5 (equation 6).



(6) EXAFF = -78.4 + 1.83 TJSEX + .039 YR + 4.28 EERt
    IMAFF t (4.36) (5.22) USIM    (4.36)   (2.76)

                                                       2 =652

The positive contemporary exchange rate coefficient here suggests a

J-curve effect, only for foreign-owned affiliates or larger for them than for

other U.S. firms.

         IV. The Country and Industry Composition of Foreign Direct
               Investment in the U.S.

IV.A. The Industry Composition of Investment

         The longest continuous series on the industry composition of foreign

direct investment in the U.S. are for the direct investment position. While that

measure is related to the composition of sales, assets, employment, or other

measures of activity, the relationship is not always close. A given amount of

assets or employment can be financed mainly by parent funds or mainly by

borrowing in the U.S. itself, and the extent of financing through borrowed

funds could vary from industry to industry. In addition, the historical data on

the U.S. position classify the origin of the investment by the country of direct,

or immediate, foreign ownership rather than by the country of the ultimate

owner, as in some of the recent data.

         One shift in the industry composition of direct investment in the U.S.

was the growth in importance of goods industries and decline in service

industries from 1950 through the early 1970s (Table 9). That change was

subsequently reversed, so that the shares in 1990 were quite similar to those

of 1960. Within these categories, petroleum first rose greatly in importance

and then declined even more, ending up at less than 10% of the total. The

decade and a half after 1960 also saw a rapid growth of wholesaling and a

decline in finance investment, both of which were subsequently reversed,

leaving both groups at the end slightly below their importance in 1974. One

consistent trend since 1974 has been a steady growth in investment in service

industries, although they were still below 10 per cent of the total in 1990.

         If we compare the trends in the distribution of FDI in the U.S. with

those of US FDI, we can see several contrasts. One strong contrast is

between goods and services, with a large shift toward services in U.S. direct

investment and a corresponding decline in the role of goods industries,

particularly petroleum. Transportation and public utilities almost vanished

from FDI in both directions, although recent relaxations in host-country rules

against foreign ownership and the desire for capital investment and

modernization may restore some of the past role of these industries in outward

U.S. FDI. The major shift in U.S. outward direct investment was the growth

in the finance sector, from about 4 per cent in the 1950s to over 30 per cent

in 1990, from far below the share in foreign direct investment in the U.S. to

well above the foreign share. The data suggest that U.S. financial firms must

have gained in some respect on their foreign rivals over these 30 years.

         A different view of the distribution of foreign-owned firms' activity

in the U.S., perhaps without some of the possible distortions of the investment

position data, is given by the distribution of assets. Assets do have their own

defects as an activity measure, giving greater weight to industries with high

ratios of capital, including financial capital, to labor than measures of output

or comprehensive input measures. They will, therefore, give a high weight

to affiliates in finance, even when banking is omitted. In addition, the
                                      - 34 -

fmancial assets are much more likely to be outside the U.S. than fixed assets

or labor. An advantage of the asset data is that they are available as far back

as 1959 and thus give a view of the whole 30 years since then.

          The most striking change in the distribution of foreign affiliate assets

is the enormous shift from goods industries to service industries, broadly

defined to include trade and finance, as well as other services (Table 10).

Goods industries accounted for over three quarters of foreign affiliates' assets

in 1959, and only a third in 1987. The sharpest fall was in the share of the

petroleum industry, followed by that in manufacturing. The corresponding

increase was not spread over service industries, but was concentrated in

finance, although some other service sectors did grow.

    This shift in industry composition partly confirms that shown by the data

on investment position (Table 9) but the changes in the asset distribution were

far larger and show a much larger finance sector, even though the

investment position data include banking.

          Orr's (1991) estimate of Japanese automobile production assets that

were involved in manufacturing, but listed under wholesale trade in the

Department of Commerce data, discussed earlier, would roughly double the

share of that industry in the total. The share would still be one of the lowest

in our list.

         A measure of labor input is provided by employment in foreign-

owned affiliates. Unfortunately, the employment data cover only the second

half of the period spanned by the data on assets and the direct investment

position.

        The employment data confirm the shift out of goods production and

into service production after the mid-1970s, as well as the particularly large

decline in employment in petroleum (Table 11). The rising fields for foreign

firms, according to the employment data, were retail trade and other services.

However, the employment data do not show the rise in importance of nonbank

finance indicated by the investment and assets data.

        A comparison of the industry distribution of employment in foreign-

owned affiliates with that of U.S. firms as a group shows a much slower shift

from manufacturing on the part of the foreign firms, but much more of a

decline in petroleum, which includes some refining operations.            The

comparison also points up the much heavier concentration of foreign firms'

employment in manufacturing and in goods production in general, more than

twice the U.S. proportion by the end of the period. One can read this

comparison as a sign of declining comparative advantage of U.S. companies

in manufacturing, although not necessarily of the U.S. as a production

location, since the foreign firms were choosing the U.S. as a manufacturing

location. However, as we have shown elsewhere (Lipsey and Kravis, 1987;

Blomström and Lipsey, 1989; and Kravis and Lipsey, 1992), there is no sign

of any such decline in competitiveness of U.S. manufacturing firms in world

export markets. The rising share of foreign firms in U.S. manufacturing may

reflect mainly the increasing internationalization of the foreign firms.

         The other side of this story is the much greater concentration of U.S.

employment in services, with the foreign share growing, but still far behind.

         A somewhat different picture of the comparative advantages of firms

appears if we compare foreign affiliates in the U.S. with U.S. parent

companies. In this comparison we are holding constant not only the location

of production, but also the multinationality of the firms. Both sets of firms

produce in the U.S. and in foreign countries and are probably of similar size,

while the total of U.S. firms in Table 11 includes many smaller ones that are

less likely to be making a choice of production location.

         The distribution of employment by U.S. parents is given in Table 12.

U.S. parents are more concentrated in goods industries than are foreign

affiliates, although parent employment, too, has shifted toward service

industries. Manufacturing accounts for more of parent employment than of

affiliate employment, but the margin has been decreasing, another suggestion

that the comparative advantage of U.S. firms relative to foreign firms has been

moving away from manufacturing.              Among manufacturing industries,

chemicals are the industry in which foreign affiliates are much more

concentrated than are U.S. parents. Transport equipment is the industry in

which U.S. parents are more concentrated than the foreign firms. In neither

case   is there any clear sign of a trend over these 15 years.        Outside of

manufacturing, U.S. parents and foreign affiliates show the same rising shares

of their employment in the narrowly defmed service sector.

         While labor input by foreign-owned affiliates receives the most

attention, we may also wish to observe the distribution of these firms'

additions to the physical capital stock of the U.S. Some of the trends observed

for labor recur in the capital expenditure data, particularly the steep decline in

the shares of the petroleum and mining industries and the rise in the share of

the finance sector, all always a much larger part of capital expenditure than of

employment. There were also increases in the shares of retail trade in plant

and equipment expenditure. This is an industry more important in employment

than in capital expenditure (Table 13). In manufacturing there was something

of a contrast between the employment and capital expenditure measures: a

small decline in the industry's employment share but a rise in its share in

capital spending. Those differences suggest more of a move to higher capital

intensity among manufacturing affiliates than among those in other industries.

Within the fmance sector, the major growth was the jump in the share of the

real estate industry during the 1970s. This is always, of course, an extremely

capital intensive industry, with a measured capital/labor ratio often inflated

by the fact that the labor input involved is employed by other service

industries, even when it contributes to the sales of the real estate sector.

         The closest approach we have to an output measure for foreign-owned

affiliates over thirty years is total sales, but we cannot deduct purchased

inputs. In the earlier years we cannot even deduct imports, although that

would be possible for more recent years.

         In 1959, the sales of foreign-owned affiliates in the U.S. were

overwhelmingly concentrated in goods industries, particularly petroleum and

manufacturing (Table 14). Those two accounted for over 90 per cent of all

foreign affiliate sales.

         By 1974, almost half the sales were by wholesale trade affiliates, and

all goods industries combined accounted for only 40 per cent of total affiliate

sales. It is not clear whether there was a great change in the type of goods

sold. There may have been only a change in organization, to separate sales

from manufacturing activities, or possibly a change in the way the data were

collected. Within the goods sector, the changes were smaller, but there was

a shift from manufacturing to petroleum and, among manufacturing industry

groups, out of foods and into metals.

         After 1974 the changes were smaller, mainly the decline in petroleum

IV.B. The Sources of Foreign Direct Investment in the U.S.

        The historical data on the country of origin of direct investment in the

U.S. are based on the location of the immediate owner. Only for 1977 and

later years are there data on the location of the "ultimate beneficial owner,"

which can be different for various reasons including the tax treatment of

earnings by host countries.

        In 1960, foreign direct investment in the United States meant

European and Canadian investment, with English-speaking countries alone

accounting for

over 60 per cent. The majority of investments were in large enterprises long

present in the United States, such as the branch lines of Canadian railroads,

Royal Dutch-Shell petroleum interests, and Swiss chemical and pharmaceutical

firms. The Commerce Department report for 1960 commented that "A

sustained increase in the role of flow of foreign industrial capital to the United

States has not yet developed and "The Department of Commerce, and various

States, are now developing programs to bring opportunities here to the

attention of foreign industrialists and other investors" (U.S. Department of

Commerce, 1962, p. 4). There is no indication here of any hostility toward

inward investment or any fear of its consequences, but more of an interest in

promoting its growth.

          The country distribution of investment in 1990 presents some contrasts

with the earlier one, but some continuity also, and the later data are available

by the country of the ultimate owner rather than only the immediate foreign

parent.

          The   U.K. share declined,   but less than might have been expected


from   the overall decline in the position of the UK in the world economy. The

importance of Canada decreased greatly and Germany and France became

fairly important sources of investment. The major new source is, of course,

Japan, passing the Netherlands in importance and second only to the UK. A

country that warranted only a line in the 1960 survey is now the second largest

investor of all.

          The availability of data by the country of ultimate ownership reveals

some interesting contrasts with those by the country of the immediate parent.

The latter data are shown to exaggerate the decline in the importance of
                                      - 47   -

Canada   and understate that for the Netherlands, because a change in Canadian

tax laws caused some Canadian owners to shift nominal ownership to the

Netherlands. Germany and France are shown to be more important as sources

of investment than the parent country data indicate. A large part of the direct

investment in the U.S. originating in the Middle East, and in Brazil (and other

South American countries), is apparently owned through intermediate

subsidiaries based in Panama, the Bahamas, and the Netherlands Antilles.

"Advantages to UBO's of holding their U.S. investments indirectly through

these countries may include minimization of taxes, avoidance of regulatory

constraint, and protection of privacy" (Belli, 1981, p. 63). Some examples of

Middle Eastern property holdings in the United States with intermediate

parents established in the Netherlands Antilles are described in a recent article

that also indicates that these intermediaries were shifted to the United States

for tax reasons after the passage of the 1986 Tax Reform Act ("Abu Dhabi's

Links With a Powerful Law Firm Present Problem for Democrats on BCCI

issue," Wall Street Journal, May 20, 1992).

         The country distribution of sales in 1959 matched that of the direct

investment stock in 1960 fairly well. Companies from Canada accounted for

a little over 30 per cent of sales and almost all the rest were from affiliates of

companies based in Europe (Table 15). By 1974, only two thirds of sales

were from affiliates of Canadian and European firms and that share was

approximately the same in 1987. The very large share of the Netherlands in

1959,   most of which was in the petroleum industry, was greatly reduced by

1974, while affiliates from Japan, largely in wholesale trade, became the

largest in terms of sales. After 1974 the pace of change became much slower,

the main shifts being a reduction in the Netherlands share and a rise in that of

German firms.

          The country of origin distribution for manufacturing affiliates showed

a little less change than that for all affiliates. The main difference was that

Japanese manufacturing affiliates played a much smaller role, remaining

behind those from the U.K. and Germany. Also, in manufacturing, the

European share remained, in 1987, higher than it had been in 1959. The main

shifts in country sources, however, matched those in the total: a large decline

for Canada, mainly before 1974, a large and steady decline for Netherlands

affiliates, and major increases for those from France, Germany, and Japan.

          The distributions of sales by industry and investing country suggest

what the directions of comparative advantage were for companies from

different countries. For example, over 70 per cent of U.S. affiliate sales by

Netherlands-owned affiliates were in the petroleum industry in 1959, and the

share declined, but was still close to half in 1987, far above the average for

other countries (Appendix Table 15). Affiliates from Germany and the

Netherlands had exceptionally large shares of their sales in chemicals.

Japanese affiliate sales were extremely concentrated in wholesale trade

affiliates, because they were, to a large extent, involved in the distribution of
                                     - 50 -

 products exported from Japan. Within manufacturing, however, the Japanese

 affiliates' sales were particularly large in transport equipment, reflecting the

 strength of Japanese motor vehicle producers. For the United Kingdom, the

 specialization in foods was above the average for all foreign firms.

          Outside of manufacturing, Canadian firms had disproportionate shares

 of their sales in insurance, in real estate, and especially in mining. Aside

 from wholesale trade, fmance also accounted for a relatively large share of

sales for Japanese firms.

         The sales distributions are an indication of the worldwide comparative

advantages of firms based in different countries but they may not reflect their

advantages in producing in the U.S., since large parts of the affiliate sales,

varying widely among firms and countries, originate from production outside

the U.S. The employment distributions may reflect more clearly the
advantages firms from different countries have in producing in the U.S.

         The concentration on chemicals among German firms in 1974 stands

out clearly in the fact that 36 per cent of their affiliates' employment in the

United States was in that industry, as against an average for all countries of

under 11 per cent. The only observable deviations of even close to this

magnitude (many entries are missing) from the average distribution for the

world are of Japanese firms in wholesale trade and the U.K. firms in retailing.

         By 1987, German affiliates in the U.S., while still more concentrated

on chemicals than those of any other country, had diversified, and were then
                                          - 51    -

of far more importance than average in non-electrical machinery also.
Canadian and French affiliates were much more heavily represented in

machinery than were the world's enterprises, on average, and Japanese firms

had become exceptionally concentrated in fmance (except banking), as well as

in wholesale trade.

 V. Financial Aspects of Foreign Direct Investment in the United States

          For many years, most of the additions to U.S. direct investment

abroad have come from the reinvested earnings of U.S. companies already

established in foreign countries. Even as early as 1966-76, almost 60 per cent

of the growth in the U.S. outward stock was from reinvestment. The trend

has been very different for foreign direct investment in the United States.

Almost half of the growth in the foreign position in the U.S. in the 1950s, and

over 60 per cent in the 1960s, was financed by reinvested earnings. In the

1970s, however, although reinvested earnings grew rapidly, to over four times

the level in the 1960s, they financed only a third of the growth in the stock,

as equity and intercompany account inflows grew to eight times their level of

the 1960s.

         The 1980s were again a contrast to all the earlier periods. Equity and

intercompany flows, particularly the former, grew explosively to over twelve

times the 1970s level.      At the same time, reinvested earnings almost

disappeared, falling from $14 billion in the 1970s to about $3 billion in the

1980s. In half the years of the 1980s the reinvested earnings were negative,

a cumulative total of $5 billion if 1990 is added in. Thus, while U.S. direct

investment abroad seems to have entered an era of mature self-financing, with

few new firms entering the list of overseas investors, foreign direct investment

in the u.s. in the 1980s went through a period of wild growth, financed by

inflows of new money.

        The rapid growth of foreign direct investment in recent years has

consisted mainly of acquisitions of existing U.S. firms, rather than the

establishment of new firms. Comprehensive data from the U.S. Department

of Commerce exist only for recent years, but they do show a continued move

in this direction. In 1984-87, over 80 per cent of inflows of foreign direct

investment were for acquisitions. High as that was, the proportions for 1988-
                                    - 53   -

90 surpassed them, averaging close to 90 per cent. The acquisition share was

even higher in manufacturing, usually over 95 per cent during these years.

The only industry in which the establishment of new enterprises predominated

was real estate, where 90 per cent of investment flow in 1984-86 and 71 per

cent in 1987-90 consisted of the establishment of new enterprises. Even in this

case there was a trend toward acquisitions.

        Another indication that the investment rush of the last decade has been

very different from earlier foreign direct investment in the United States is

provided by the collapse in the apparent profitability of such investment.

         While there are often good reasons to doubt published data on the

profits of segments of enterprises, which is what these affiliates all are, the
                                         - 54 -

decline looks too large and too sudden to represent only a sudden rise in tax

avoidance. The very newness of the recent investments may explain some of

the decline. However, the predominance of acquisitions among recent foreign

investments means that these are generally going concerns rather than startups,

and on that ground alone one might expect a more rapid attainment of normal

profit rates.

         The data for major industry groups show that the decline in
profitability was quite general, but it was much more severe in some groups

than in others.

In petroleum    and manufacturing the very sharp declines to the 1985-87 levels

 were partially reversed in 1988-90. But equally sharp declines in fmance and

other industries (mining, wholesale and retail trade, and other industries) were

followed in 1988-90 by even larger declines in profitability, to the point where

profitability of U.K. investment and levels of profits in the last period for

Europe that were far above those of Canada and Japan. European investment

was more concentrated in manufacturing than those of Canada and Japan, the

latter heavily invested in real estate and banking. But this broad industry

breakdown does not tell the whole story; while most areas' manufacturing

affiliates remained profitable in the late 1980s, Japan's made losses in both of

the last two periods. Japan was also the country whose investment in the U.S.

had accelerated most rapidly in the late 1980s, a hint of a possible connection

between the rate of growth of investment and its profitability. Reports in the

press suggest that the declining profitability of Japanese direct investment in

the U.S. reported in the official data is not a mirage (for example, "How
                                      - 56 -

Japan    Got Burned in the U.S.A.," Fortune, June 15, 1992). A summary of

a survey of Japanese-owned U.S. affiliates by a Japanese newspaper stated that

 "...   80% of the 264 units weren't returning profits to parent companies and

63% cited earnings as their biggest concern" "Japanese Wary on U.S.

Operations," Wall Street Journal, June 9, 1992.

           An examination of the low profitability of foreign affiliates in the

U.S. relative to other U.S. firms, based on tax data for the late 1980s

(Grubert, Goodspeed, and Swenson, 1991), attributed half of the differential

to characteristics of the affiliates and of the period.            The affiliate

characteristics were the revaluation of target firm assets following acquisitions

and the immaturity of the affiliates. Both were, related to the headlong

acquisition rate of that period. The main relevant characteristic of the period

was the decline in the exchange value of the U.S. dollar.

           Some part of the rest of the differential was attributed to income

shifting by foreign firms to minimize taxes. That shifting was presumably

responsible for the fact that the proportion of affiliates with zero profits was

higher than the proportion among domestic firms. The part of the profit

differential attributable to income shifting is, in a sense, illusory. In fact, it

may represent an incentive for investment in the U.S. However, the sharp
                                     - 57 -

decline in the direct investment inflow, particularly of equity capital, in 1991,

to less than half the 1990 level, reinforces the picture of low and declining

profits (U.S. Dept. of Commerce, 1992, Table M).



                                VI. Summary

         The major development in foreign direct investment in the United

States over the past thirty years has been its enormous growth. That is the

case whether one considers the absolute values or the shares of the world's

direct investment flows and whether one considers book or market valuations.

The United States, which had accounted for a greatly disproportionate share

of the world's direct investment outflows in the 1960s, far above the U.S.

share in the world's income or output even at its peak in 1950, by the 1980s

was accounting for almost half of the world's direct investment inflows. That

share was even more disproportionate than the earlier outward share, given the

reduced importance of the United States in the world economy.

         One consequence of this huge inward flow is that the United States

has become almost as much of a host to foreign companies as other countries

are to U.S. firms. Foreign direct investment in the U.S., formerly a quarter

or even less of U.S. direct investment abroad, is now, even by current cost or
                                    - 58 -

market valuations, three quarters as large.

         The rapid growth of foreign direct investment in the U.S. has left

foreign firms still controlling only a small part of total assets of U.S. firms

and employing less than 5 per cent of the U.S. labor force. However, the

shares have become much more significant in manufacturing, quadrupling in

the last 15 years and reaching over 10 per cent of employment. The most

notable share of employment has been in chemicals, over 40 per cent in 1989.

But the industrial composition of foreign direct investment in manufacturing

has been relatively stable; chemicals was the U.S. industry most heavily

penetrated by foreign firms in 1974, and as far back as 1900, as well as at

present. If we rank industries by degree of foreign control in 1974, no

industry moved more than one rank by 1989 except electrical machinery, now

the second highest at over 15 per cent. The foreign, particularly German, role

in chemicals, has a very long history. The level of German activity was high

even before World War I and has remained high even though it was reduced

twice by confiscations of alien property during the two world wars.

        Another measure of the foreign role, the share in plant and equipment

expenditure, shows an even higher share - over half - in chemicals, but a

much lower one in electrical machinery. The foreign operations may be
                                     - 59 -

entering relatively capital-intensive sectors of the chemical industry and

relatively labor-intensive sectors of the electrical machinery industry.

        The trends in the distribution of foreign firms' activity among broad

sectors of the economy look different by different measures. The direct

investment position data show a large rise in the share of goods industries and

then, after 1974, a shift back to services, leaving the goods share a little

higher in 1990 than in 1950 and the service share a little lower. In the three

decades between 1960 and 1990, however, there was some shift towards

services. Data on total assets of foreign-owned firms show a much steadier

and stronger shift from goods industries to service industries mainly fmancial

services. The time series on sales suggest a very large shift toward services

between 1959 and 1974, but little change since then, while the shorter time

series on employment indicate a substantial shift out of goods and into services

between 1974 and 1989, despite the relatively small role they give to financial

services. Another short series, on plant and equipment investment, also points

to a shift in the direction of service activities by foreign firms, with real estate

the major factor here.

         Foreign-owned affiliates have continued to import more relative to

their exports than U.S. companies in general, but the trend appears to be
                                    - 60 -

toward foreign affiliates becoming more like other U.S. firms in this respect.

The foreign affiliates are quite sensitive to exchange rate changes in adjusting

the balance of exports and imports, but not more so than U.S. firms as a

group.

         Perhaps the most publicized change in inward direct investment in

recent years has been its source. Japan, hardly mentioned in the 1960

discussion, now accounts for 20 per cent of the stock of foreign direct

investment in the U.S., second only to the British share. Canadian investment

has shrunk in importance. But aside from these two, there are many elements

of continuity. The U.K. remains the largest investor, as it was in 1960, and

for many years before that. The Netherlands is next (after Japan), and the

following three are Germany, France, and Switzerland, as in 1960, although

the order among them has changed and Germany is now the leader among the

three.

         Data on shares of affiliate sales give a much larger role to Japan,

because of the importance of Japanese wholesale trade affiliates, and they give

a comparatively small position to affiliates from the Netherlands. Within

manufacturing, however, U.K. affiliates remain the largest single group, and

affiliates from the two English speaking countries account for over a third of
                                     - 61 -

total sales.

          One of the largest changes in foreign direct investment in recent years

has been in its fmancing. Whereas half or more of increases in investment in

the 1950s and 1960s were financed from retained earnings, the proportion

dropped almost to zero in the 1980s. The pace of new investment was too

great to be financed by reinvested earnings in any case, consisting to a large

and increasing extent of new entries to the U.S. market through takeovers of

existing U.S. firms, but in addition, earnings fell and reinvested earnings were

negative in many years during the 1980s. To some extent the poor earnings

reflected the deep recession of the early 1980s, and that of 1990 also, but one

may suspect that poor choices of investment targets, high prices paid for

existing companies, and the willingness of foreign firms to pay heavily for

access to U.S. markets may all have played a role. The steep decline in rates

of return during the 1980s also points in the same direction, although affiliates

from the Netherlands and Canada, two traditional sources of foreign

investment, also suffered sharp reductions in profitability.

Notes to Appendix Table 2

      a. We omit Netherlands Antilles Finance affiliates after 1977
         because they ate almost entirely "shell" operations set up for tax
         reasons to borrow abroad and relend the proceeds to their parents.

      b. The operating companies owned by the holding companies are often
         outside the finance sector.

      c. Figures comparable to 1950 are 26,278 for total investment, 9,106 for
         petroleum, and 8,414 for manufacturing.

      d. Figures comparable to 1957 are 54,799 for total investment, 16,222
         for petroleum, and 22,078 for manufacturing.

           Affiliates owned indirectly are classified by their country and
           industry of operation rather than by the country and industry of the
           primary affiliates that are their intermediate owners. The largest
           effects are to increase the importance of petroleum wholesale trade
           and of manufacturing and to decrease the importance of holding
           companies.
