Middlemen versus Market Makers: A Theory of Competitive Exchange

NBER Working Paper No. 8883

JEL No. D4, D5, D6, D8

ABSTRACT
We present a model in which the microstructure of trade in a commodity or asset is endogenously
determined. Producers and consumers of a commodity (or buyers and sellers of an asset) who wish to
trade can choose between two competing types of intermediaries: “middlemen” (dealer/brokers) and
“market makers” (specialists). Market makers post publicly observable bid and ask prices, whereas the
prices quoted by different middlemen are private information that can only be obtained through a costly
search process. We consider an initial equilibrium where there are no market makers but there is free
entry of middlemen with heterogeneous transactions costs. We characterize conditions under which entry
of a single market maker can be profitable even though it is common knowledge that all surviving
middlemen will undercut the market maker’s publicly posted bid and ask prices in the post-entry
equilibrium. The market maker’s entry induces the surviving middlemen to reduce their bid-ask spreads,
and as a result, all producers and consumers who choose to participate in the market enjoy a strict increase
in their expected gains from trade. We show that strict Pareto improvements occur even in cases where
the market maker’s entry drives all middlemen out of business, monopolizing the intermediation of trade
in the market.

In the early 1970s, the firm [ Cantor Fitzgerald ] vaulted to nearly monopolistic pre-eminence
in the bond market by doing something no one else had done before: Cantor began posting
government bond prices on computer screens for clients, mainly Wall Street bond dealers,
bringing transparency to a market where opacity and rumor had been the norm.1
Why would I want to post my prices on the web? If I did that, my competitors could see what
I am charging and would undercut my prices by a few pennies, and I would lose most of my
business.2

1 Introduction
We observe significant differences in the microstructure of trade in various commodities and assets. A
significant share of trade in commodities such as wheat and pork bellies and in financial assets such as
common stocks and Treasury securities is intermediated by market makers (also known as specialists), at
publicly posted bid and ask prices. Market makers typically either own or are members of an exchange
such as the New York Stock Exchange or the Chicago Board of Trade. However for other commodities
such as steel, virtually all trade is conducted by middlemen (also known as dealerbrokers in financial
markets or “steel service centers” in the steel market), at individually negotiated prices. In the steel market
there are no market makers or exchanges where valid current bid and ask prices are publicly posted.
Instead, transaction prices are private information, forcing traders in the steel market to engage in search
and bargaining to find a good price.
It is commonly believed that market makers and exchanges are appropriate for trading highly standardized commodities and assets for which the volume is sufficiently large to produce “thick” and “active”
markets. However, most types of steel coil and plate are at least as standardized as wheat or pork bellies,
and the volume of trade in these particular steel products is at least as large. A number of potential market
makers such as MetalSite, e-STEEL, and Enron have recently attempted to enter the steel market, but so
far without success. Enron went bankrupt in December 2001, MetalSite’s website was closed in June 2001
(although it was reopened in November 2001), and e-STEEL changed its name to NewView Technologies
in November 2001, reflecting a new focus away from steel. Thus, at present no market makers handle
a significant share of trade in steel. So the first puzzle is to explain why market makers such as Cantor
Fitzgerald have been successful in entering and transforming the trade in bonds, but not in steel.

The second quotation above suggests that even though new information technologies such as the Internet make it nearly costless to post and update bid and ask prices publicly, it might still be unprofitable
for potential market makers to enter markets such as steel. If buyers of steel are accustomed to searching,
then middlemen can easily respond to the entry of a market maker by slightly undercutting the market
maker’s prices, stealing most of his business. So the second puzzle is to explain how a market maker such
as Cantor Fitzgerald can successfully enter a market such as the bond market if the existing middlemen
can respond by undercutting the market maker’s publicly posted bid and ask prices.
As a step toward answering these puzzles and understanding the differences in the microstructure of
trade that we observe across various markets, we present a simple model in which the share of trade
intermediated by middlemen and market makers is endogenously determined. Our model also provides
insights into the likely effects of the huge reduction in search and transactions costs resulting from the
information revolution and the advent of the World Wide Web. These technologies have facilitated the
rapid emergence of market makers operating web-based “B2B exchanges” that intermediate business-tobusiness trade, threatening the existence of traditional middlemen in these markets.3
Our model is an extension of a model of intermediation and search due to Spulber (1996a). Spulber’s
model has three types of agents: buyers (consumers), sellers (producers), and price-setting middlemen.
Since middlemen are often called dealers, we refer to Spulber’s model as an analysis of the dealer market. Our main extension is to consider the effect of introducing a fourth type of agent, market makers. In
Spulber’s model, middlemen are assumed to be the exclusive avenue of exchange: every producer wishing
to sell a commodity (or asset) and every consumer wishing to purchase it is required to transact via middlemen rather than trade directly with each other. Transactions in the dealer market occur over a range of
individually negotiated prices — the outcome of a costly sequential search process.
We study the effect of introducing a monopolist market maker on the search equilibrium in the dealer
market. The market maker can be conceptualized as operating an exchange on which publicly observable
bid and ask prices are posted. Producers and consumers now have the option of trading on the exchange
at the publicly posted bid and ask prices, or searching for a better price in the dealer market. Since the
prices quoted by middlemen are not publicly posted, producers and consumers must obtain them by direct
3 The

rate of growth of B2B markets is nothing short of phenomenal: Forrester Research predicts that sales via computerized
market makers will expand fivefold in the next two years and will account for at least 25 percent of all sales in 2002, and a total
volume of $1.4 trillion in transactions by 2004. These estimates may be conservative: alternative forecasts quoted in a recent
symposium on B2B e-commerce published in the Journal of Economic Literature are substantially higher. See, for example,
Lucking-Reiley and Spulber (2001) and Bakos (2001) for even more optimistic forecasts of rapid growth in retail e-commerce.

contact (e.g., a telephone call), and the delays associated with searching constitute an implicit search cost.
Entry by a monopolist market maker is profitable even if the market maker has higher per unit transactions cost than most middlemen, provided that it is lower than that of the least efficient middleman operating in the dealer market before the entry of the market maker. If so, the entry of the market maker drives the
least efficient middle men out of business and segments the market: the highest-valuation consumers and
the lowest-cost producers (i.e., those with the largest implicit search costs) trade with the market maker,
and the residual set of intermediate-valuation consumers and intermediate-cost producers search for better
prices in the dealer market. All of the surviving middlemen undercut the bid-ask spread charged by the
monopolist market maker. Thus the entry of the monopolist market maker creates additional competition
that results in significant reductions in the bid-ask spreads in the dealer market, uniformly higher consumer
and producer surpluses, and higher trading volumes.
Middlemen and market makers represent competing institutions for the intermediation of trade. A
market maker offers a superior exchange technology for the highest-valuation buyers and the lowest-cost
sellers, and its entry raises welfare and reduces bid-ask spreads compared with the free-entry search equilibrium when all intermediation is done by middlemen. On the other hand, free entry of middlemen
provides a “competitive fringe” that limits the market power of a monopolist market maker. Without the
competitive threat of middlemen, a monopolist market maker would quote a wider bid-ask spread, and consumer and producer surplus would be significantly lower. However in some situations the market maker
can enter the market, drive all middlemen out of business, and set unconstrained monopoly bid and ask
prices in the post-entry equilibrium. Even this monopoly outcome results in a strict Pareto improvement
relative to the free-entry equilibrium that existed in the dealer market before the entry of the market maker.
The relative share of trade intermediated by middlemen rather than the market maker depends on three
parameters: the intertemporal discount rate δ and the per unit transactions costs of the market maker km
and most efficient middleman k. For a broad range of parameter values, the market maker coexists with
the dealer market. However if the market maker’s per unit transactions cost km exceeds that of the least
efficient middleman k operating in the dealer market before the entry of a market maker, then entry by
the market maker is not profitable and only middlemen will exist in equilibrium. Conversely, if the per
unit transactions cost of the most efficient middleman k is sufficiently high relative to the transactions cost
of the market maker km , then the entry of the market maker drives all middlemen out of business. The
dealer market can survive the entry of a market maker even if the transactions cost k of the most efficient
middleman exceeds the transactions cost km of the market maker – provided it is not too much greater.

Our analysis is similar in some respects to those of Gehrig (1993) and Neeman and Vulkan (2001),
although our conclusions are quite different.4 Gehrig studies a model in which producers and consumers
of a commodity have the option of trading at publicly posted bid and ask prices on an exchange run by a
market maker (which Gehrig calls an “intermediary”), or entering a “search market” in which consumers
and producers are randomly matched and engage in bargaining in an attempt to negotiate a mutually
acceptable price. Gehrig’s model differs from ours primarily in the formulation of the search market; he
models the bargaining process in the search market as a static (one-shot) random matching game in which
consumers and producers negotiate directly with each other rather than transacting through middlemen.
In Gehrig’s model the market maker always coexists with the search market and charges the same bid-ask
spread and trades the same volume regardless of the level of search costs in the search market. Neeman
and Vulkan (2001) obtain a very different result, namely, that the market maker can never coexist with the
search market in equilibrium. In their model agents have a choice between trading at posted prices with a
market maker in a centralized market and engaging in direct negotiations with a randomly chosen producer
or consumer in the search market. They prove a result similar to ours, namely, that the highest-valuation
consumers and lowest-cost producers prefer to trade with the market maker rather than engage in direct
negotiation. However, in their model the entry of a market maker causes a complete unraveling of direct
negotiations, and in equilibrium all trade is conducted in the centralized market by the market maker.
In section 2 we review a dynamic equilibrium model, introduced by Spulber (1996a), of trade with
search among competing middlemen. In section 3 we consider whether the dealer market equilibrium
characterized in section 2 can be upset by the entry of a monopolist market maker who runs a centralized
exchange with publicly posted prices. In section 4 we consider the case where there is free entry of market
makers, resulting in Bertrand-style competition that forces the bid-ask spread down to the transactions cost
of the most efficient market maker. Although our interest in alternative intermediation technologies arose
from our observations of the microstructure of trade in the steel market, we believe our theory provides
insights into the microstructure of trade in a wide range of markets. In section 5 we discuss three other
markets besides steel: the market for goods in Radford’s (1945) P.O.W. camp, the U.S. equity market,
and the U.S. Treasury market. In section 6 we offer some concluding remarks and suggestions for further
research.

discuss related papers by Baye and Morgan (2001), Caillaud and Jullien (2001), Pirrong (2000), and Hendershott and
Zhang (2001) later in the paper. A number of other studies on the role of intermediaries deserve mention although we do not
explicitly discuss them. An incomplete list includes Garman (1976), Rubinstein and Wolinsky (1987), Yanelle (1989), Yavas
(1992), and O’Hara (1995).

2 Search Equilibrium with Middlemen but No Market Maker
Our point of departure is a simple exchange economy in which the only intermediaries are middlemen.
We present a modified version of Spulber’s (1996a) equilibrium search model with three types of agents:
producers, consumers, and middlemen. In this model producers and consumers cannot trade directly with
each other. Instead all trade must be intermediated by middlemen. To keep our presentation self-contained,
we review Spulber’s model in this section before presenting our extension of his model in which we analyze
the effect of introducing a fourth type of agent — a market maker. Since middlemen of the type studied in
this section are called dealers in a variety of financial and commodity markets, we refer to Spulber’s work
as an analysis of a competitive dealer market.
The dealer market consists of a continuum of heterogeneous producers, consumers, and middlemen.
A producer of type v can produce at most one unit of the good at a cost of v. A consumer of type v
can consume at most one unit of the good and is willing to pay at most v to consume it. Producers and
consumers remain in the market for a random (geometrically distributed) length of time before permanently
exiting. Let λ

 0  1 

be the probability of a producer or a consumer exiting the market in period t. A

consumer or producer may randomly exit before having a chance to consume or sell a unit of the good,
respectively. However, if they succeed in trading prior to exiting, the unitary supply-demand assumption
implies that these individuals will not make any subsequent transactions after their initial trade.
Suppose that whenever a producer or a consumer exits the market, he or she is replaced by a new

fraction λ of the population of producers and consumers exits the market and is replaced by an inflow of
an equal fraction of new producers and consumers.
In a dealer market there is no central exchange or marketplace where the commodity is traded. In
particular, there is no advertising or central, publicly accessible site where middlemen can post bid and ask
prices. Instead, the only way for producers and consumers to obtain price quotes is by directly contacting
individual middlemen. Middle men are infinitely lived and set a pair of stationary bid and ask prices
to maximize their expected discounted profits. There are a continuum of middlemen indexed by k, the
marginal costs of executing each trade between a producer and a consumer. Transactions costs k are

6

 

distributed uniformly over the interval k 1 . The lower bound k is the marginal transactions cost of the
most efficient middleman. It may not be possible for all potential middlemen to enter the dealer market and
make a profit. We will let k denote the transactions cost of the least efficient middleman who participates
in the dealer market in equilibrium. Thus profits earned by this marginal middleman k are zero, although
the more efficient, inframarginal middlemen with k

can earn positive profits in equilibrium. A

Producers and consumers engage in sequential search. Each period a searcher obtains a single price

the possibility of random exit from the market prior to trading (in which case the exiting agent fails to
receive any gains from trade).5 The stationarity of the bid and ask prices charged by middlemen together
with the heterogeneity in their transactions costs implies that the sequence of realized price quotes obtained
by consumers and producers are independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) draws from the stationary

distributions of bid and ask prices charged by middlemen. Let Fα a denote the distribution of ask prices

Let Vc a v denote the present discounted value of an optimal search strategy for a consumer of type
v who has received a quoted ask price of a from a randomly chosen middleman. The consumer has three
choices: a) do nothing (i.e., do not buy at the ask price a and do not search), b) accept the middleman’s
ask price of a, or c) reject the middleman’s ask price of a and continue searching for a better price. These
three options are reflected in the following Bellman equation for the consumer’s problem:

where a a is the support of the distribution of ask prices charged by middlemen. The value of 0 in
the Bellman equation corresponds to the option of not searching, not trading, and not consuming. All
5 It is possible to extend the model by including explicit per period search costs γ. However, it is not difficult to show that a
stationary equilibrium in the dealer market cannot exist if γ 0. Therefore we restrict γ 0 in the analysis that follows, accounting
only for the implicit search costs resulting from exiting the market before having an opportunity to execute a transaction (the λ
parameter), and the discounting of delayed gains from trade (the ρ parameter).

consumers with sufficiently low valuations will choose this option. Clearly, any consumer with valuation

Now consider the remaining high-valuation consumers. As is well known, the optimal search strategy

for a consumer of type v takes the form of a reservation price rule: accept any ask price less than the

The difference between a consumer’s valuation v and his or her reservation value rc v is the net value

dashed line of height equal to 5 in figure 1. The area in the triangular regions between the 45-degree line

and the reservation price curves represents the inefficiency of the search equilibrium outcome, i.e. the lost
gains from trade to producers and consumers.
Intermediaries maximize expected discounted profits subject to the constraint that supply and demand

This occurs since some of the consumers who attempted to search for the good ended up exiting the
dealer market before they were able to find a sufficiently attractive price. This is part of the deadweight
loss involved in the operation of the dealer market. Another component of the deadweight loss due to
sequential search and the implied delay in trading and consuming is the discounting of the gains from
trade for those transactions that are ultimately realized.
Total expected discounted demand is the expected discounted value of the stream of demands in all

We can see from these equations that as δ G 0 and k G 0, the distributions of bid and ask prices converge to
a degenerate distribution with all mass on the single price p H 5, the Walrasian equilibrium value. We can
also see from equation (20) that the equilibrium quantity traded also converges to q3 I 5, the Walrasian
equilibrium quantity. Thus the dealer market equilibrium contains the Walrasian equilibrium as a limiting
special case as search and transactions costs tend to zero.

We conclude by providing formulas for profits and surplus in this economy. These formulas will be
important in the next section, since they enable us to determine the relative efficiency of the dealer market
equilibrium compared with an equilibrium with possible entry by a market maker. Total consumer and

3 Search Equilibrium with a Monopoly Market Maker
In this section we extend Spulber’s (1996a) model of search equilibrium with producers, consumers, and
middlemen by introducing a fourth type of agent: a monopolist market maker. Initially we assume there is
at most one potential entrant who could assume the role of a monopolist market maker, quoting publicly

  

observable bid and ask prices am bm . If this market maker enters, producers and consumers can choose

  

between trading with the market maker at the publicly posted bid and ask prices am bm , and searching
for a better bid or ask price in the dealer market.
We begin our analysis by characterizing how the presence of a market maker affects the solution to
consumers’ and producers’ optimal search problems. We then derive conditions under which entry by
a market maker is profitable and compute the market maker’s optimal pricing strategy. In doing so, we
compute the dealer’s equilibrium response to the market maker’s entry and pricing rules. We then compare
equilibrium outcomes for economies with and with out a market maker. Finally we summarize the limiting
properties the model.

3.1 The consumers’ and producers’ decision rules
Consider a consumer who has not yet chosen to search. The consumer has three options: a) do nothing,
b) purchase a unit of the commodity in the exchange at price am , or c) search for a better price in the dealer



market. The consumer’s value function is given by

in hand, he has the fourth options of accepting the offer from the middleman. The Bellman equation for

Thus these producers choose to search for a better price in the dealer market rather than trade with the
market maker at price bm . The remaining producers with production costs v

trading with the market maker or with any middleman in the dealer market, and so these producers do not
participate and earn a net surplus of zero. Symmetrical results hold for consumers.

Figure 2: Decision Rules for Producers and Consumers

3.2 The intermediaries’ entry and pricing decisions
In the previous subsection, consumers and producers took prices as given. In this subsection we analyze
the market maker’s entry and pricing decision. We then derive the response of the middlemen to the market
maker’s entry. In particular, there are three possible regimes in equilibrium: an unconstrained monopoly
regime, a limit-pricing regime, and a competivitive regime. In first two regimes, the market maker drives
all the middlemen out of business. In the competitive regime, a set of middlemen coexists with the market
maker. In the limit-pricing and competitive regimes, the existence or potential entry of middlemen in the
market limits the market power of the market maker.
All consumers know they have the option of purchasing the commodity from the market maker at
price am , and all producers know they can sell the commodity to the market maker at price bm . Clearly,

16

no middleman in the dealer market would be able to sell at an ask price a higher than am . Similarly, no
middleman would be able to purchase the commodity for less than the bid price charged by the market
maker. Thus we have:
Theorem 3: bm is the lowest reservation price of producers participating in the dealer market and a lower
bound on the support of the distribution of bid prices offered by middlemen. am is the highest reservation
price of consumers participating in the dealer market and an upper bound on the support of the distribution
of ask prices charged by middlemen in the dealer market:

bid-ask spread set by the market maker. Even though it is common knowledge that a randomly drawn
bid from the dealer market will be less than bm with probability 1, this bid will only materialize after a
one-period delay. The highest-valuation buyers and lowest cost producers prefer to trade immediately at
the less favorable prices offered by the market maker rather than incur the search/delay costs involved in
trying to find a better price in the dealer market.
If the monopolist market maker sets an ask price of am and offers a bid price bm , Theorem 1 implies that

Clearly the number of intermediaries that can be supported in equilibrium depends on how aggressively
the market maker prices. The following result shows that the number of middlemen operating in the dealer

0, then as long as the bid-ask spread charged by the monopolist market maker is positive, the dealer

market will never be driven out of existence by the entry of the market maker. This will be true even if
am

a, which is the lowest ask price charged by the most efficient middleman (with cost k

k

0) in the

search equilibrium without a market maker. The least efficient intermediaries are driven out of the market,
and the remaining, more efficient intermediaries are forced to reduce their bid-ask spreads below their preentry values in order to avoid taking a loss. Therefore both the upper and lower supports of the distribution
of ask prices in the dealer market fall as a result of the entry of the market maker. Symmetrically, the entry
of the market maker increases the lower and upper support points of the distribution of bid prices in the
dealer market. This suggests that the entry of the market maker should result in a strict increase in the
expected gains from trade for all producers and consumers who participate in the market – regardless of
whether they choose to trade with the market maker or search for a middleman in the dealer market.
On one hand, the fact that middlemen uniformly undercut the market maker’s posted bid and ask prices
could make it unprofitable for the market maker to enter. On the other hand, if the market maker’s per unit
transactions cost km is sufficiently lower than k, the transactions cost of the most efficient middleman,
the entry of the market maker might succeed in driving the entire dealer market out of existence. To
determine what will actually happen, we need to derive the market maker’s profit function and optimal
pricing strategy. By Theorem 4 we know that bm

The fundamental condition for the viability of entry by a monopolist market maker given in equation (38) of Theorem 5 has a very simple interpretation. The expression on the right-hand side of equation (38) equals the efficiency level k of the marginal middleman in the equilibrium without a market
maker. Thus the monopolist market maker’s per unit transactions cost must be lower than the marginal
cost of the marginal middleman in the pre-entry dealer market equilibrium if entry is to be feasible. However the market maker need not have lower transactions costs than all middlemen in order for entry to be
feasible. Even if the market maker’s transactions cost is uniformly lower than the transactions costs of all
middlemen, the dealer market will not necessarily be driven out of existence.

3.3 Equilibria with and without a monopolist market maker

subsection to dealer-market equilibrium described in section 3. Figure 4 compares the equilibria with and
without a monopolist market maker in the case where km

is less than half the total amount traded in the dealer market prior to the entry of the market maker. The
market maker charges a bid-ask spread of am



* 22 * 61  39, which equals the bid-ask spread of

bm

the most efficient middleman in the equilibrium without a market maker. The average bid-ask spread in
the dealer market nearly halves, from 1666 to 085, following the entry of the market maker. In this case,
the market maker’s bid and ask prices bm and am equal the highest bid price bd and the lowest ask price
ad , respectively, in the pre-entry dealer market equilibrium. The following corollary characterizes how
the market maker’s prices relate to the bid-ask prices prevailing in the pre-entry equilibrium in the dealer
market.

Corollaries 5.7 and 5.8 formalize the notion that entry of the market maker lowers bid-ask spreads. In
the competitive regime the market maker’s bid-ask spread is strictly smaller than the worst bid-ask spread
charged by the highest-cost middleman in the pre-entry equilibrium. Since the market maker’s bid-ask
spread is necessarily the worst bid-ask spread in the post-entry equilibrium, it follows that the market
maker’s entry has succeeded in reducing both the average and the worst bid-ask spreads in the dealer
market. Indeed, the entry of the market maker not only narrows bid-ask spreads, but also shifts the entire
distribution of ask prices downward. That is, if we let ai and ai denote the support of the distribution of ask

Since the distributions of bid and ask prices have strictly improved in the post-entry equilibrium, it
follows that all consumers and producers who participate in the post-entry equilibrium are strictly better

off as a result of the entry of the market maker. Corollary 5.8 shows that even when the market maker
drives the dealer market out of existence, the market maker’s ask price am is strictly less than the valuation
ad of the marginal consumer in the pre-entry equilibrium. Since the reservation price function for buyers
in the pre-entry equilibrium is strictly increasing in v with a minimum value of ad , it follows that all buyers
whose valuations satisfy v

am are strictly better off in the post-entry equilibrium (where am is the lowest

ask price in the dealer market in the post-entry equilibrium). We formalize the foregoing discussion as

Figure 5 illustrates the welfare gains resulting from the entry of a market maker. In this example we
continue to set δ

0. Any consumer in the interval am 1 is made strictly better

off from the entry of the market maker, where am

M 56 is the lower support point of the distribution of

ask prices in the dealer market in the post-entry equilibrium. The low-valuation consumers located in the

  

interval 0 am do not trade, and their welfare is not affected by the entry of the market maker. Clearly, the
entry of the market maker causes the lower support of the distribution of ask prices to fall. Thus there is
a larger set of active consumers in the equilibrium with a market maker, and the consumers who switch
from non-participation to search become strictly better off. Symmetric results apply to producers.

Along the abscissa, buyers’ valuations are plotted from high to low, whereas sellers’ valuations (costs) are plotted from low

The entry of the market maker halves the volume of trade in the dealer market (from 3889 to 1944)
and the discounted profits of middlemen, and cuts profits to one fourth of the pre-entry level (from 0494
to 0123). However the market maker’s volume of 25 and profits of 0556 more than make up for the
losses incurred in the dealer market, so that overall quantity traded and overall discounted profits increase
following the entry of the market maker. Total discounted surplus of consumers (and producers) is 0782
in the post entry equilibrium (i.e., with a market maker) compared with 0489 in the pre-entry equilibrium
(i.e., without a market maker). Total discounted surplus (i.e., including the discounted profits of middlemen
and the market maker) increases from 1471 in the equilibrium without a market maker to 2242 in the
equilibrium after the entry of the market maker. Comparing these total gains from trade with the 25 gains
from trade that would be realized in a frictionless Walrasian equilibrium, we see that the entry of the
market maker has increased overall market efficiency from 58.8 percent to 89.7 percent.
The rise in total surplus is due largely to the reduction in the deadweight loss of the transactions costs
of the less efficient middle men who were forced out of business by the more efficient market maker
(whose marginal transactions cost is zero). However, another source of the reduction in deadweight loss
is the reduction in search costs due to the entry of the market maker: in the post-entry equilibrium over
half of all trades occur at the bid and ask prices set by the market maker, so that a much smaller fraction
of trading is subject to search costs in the post entry equilibrium. We obtain these favorable results even
though the market maker is a monopolist: ordinarily monopoly power creates deadweight losses rather
than reduces them. Provided that the market maker’s transactions costs are not too high, publicly posting
bid and ask prices represents a superior institution for conducting trade via a search market.
The following theorem shows that entry of the market maker does not always increase total discounted
profits: total discounted profits increase in the post-entry equilibrium only when km is not too high.

Since the entry of the market maker strictly increases both consumer and producer surplus, but can

gains from trade (i.e., the sum of discounted surplus and discounted profits) is unclear. Figure 7 plots

increase following the entry of the market maker. However, we also see that total surplus is a monotonically

figure 7 we indicate the various equilibrium regimes by the symbols R1 (for the unconstrained monopoly
regime), R2 (for the limit pricing regime), R3 (for the competitive regime where the middle man and dealer
market coexist), and R4 (for the case where km

that surplus is constant as a function of km in region R2 since, in this regime, the market maker’s bid and
ask prices are functions of k, not km .

Figure 7: Decomposition of Total Gains from Trade for various km when k

0 and k

D6

The two panels of figure 7 illustrate how the competition between middlemen and the market maker
affects the division of the gains from trade between producers, consumers, and intermediaries. Consider
the case where the market maker has transactions cost km
transactions cost k

0. When the most efficient middleman also has

0, the dealer market and the market maker coexist and generate total gains from trade

of 2242, or nearly 90 percent of the Walrasian surplus of 25. Producers and consumers realize a surplus of
1564, or nearly 70 percent of the total discounted gains from trade. However when k

D 6, producers and

consumers realize a surplus of only 0625, which is only one-third of the total gains from trade of 1875.
The market maker obtains the lion’s share of the surplus, earning the unconstrained monopoly profit of
125. Thus the market maker is made better off, and producers and consumers are made correspondingly
worse off, by any measure that limits entry or increases the transactions costs of middlemen.
Similarly, middlemen can increase their profits at the expense of consumers and producers by promulgating measures that artificially limit entry or increase the transactions cost of the market maker. For
example, the left-hand panel of figure 7 indicates that if middlemen were successful in passing a law
preventing the entry of market makers, total discounted surplus of producers and consumers would fall
significantly. For example in the presence of a market maker with km

0, total producer and consumer

surplus is 1564, whereas if entry of a market maker is prohibited, total producer and consumer surplus
would fall by 38 percent to 0977.
Although all of our numerical results indicate that total gains from trade are a monotonically decreasing
function of km for km



km (which implies that the entry of a market maker always increases total gains
29

from trade for any km



k), we have not yet been able to prove this analytically. Below we simply state our

conjecture that entry by the market maker is always welfare-improving.

charge a limiting bid-ask spread of zero at the common Walrasian equilibrium price of p

This result implies that the coexistence of middlemen and market makers should be fairly robust in a
world of steadily declining search and transactions costs due to technological improvements in information
and communications technologies. However, the conceptual distinctions between middlemen and market
makers start to blur in the limit, since the prices charged by all surviving middlemen are virtually the
same as the bid and ask prices charged by the market maker. We view Theorem 11 as a characterization
of “efficient markets”: when search and transactions costs are small, bid-ask spreads are very narrow, so
that there is not much difference between trading with a market maker and trading in the dealer market.
For this reason there is approximately a 50-50 split in trade between these two competing institutions.
However in the limit it does not matter whether the microstructure of trade involves only middlemen or
a combination of middlemen and a market maker. As we saw in section 2, we have convergence to a

G

G

Walrasian equilibrium even in the absence of entry by a market maker provided that δ 0 and k 0.
The entry of a market maker is much more important when k or δ is large. Conversely, if a market
maker is able to obtain unconstrained monopoly power by creating artificial barriers to entry by middlemen
or other, competing market makers, then large efficiency and welfare gains can be achieved by breaking
down these barriers and subjecting the market maker to competitive pressure to reduce bid-ask spreads.
In the next section we will consider the case in which the market maker faces competition from other
potential market makers as well as from middlemen.

4 Search Equilibrium with Competitive Market Making
Now suppose there is free entry into market making. If there are no fixed entry costs and entry occurs
simultaneously, Bertrand-style price competition will ensue among competing market makers. Since all
31

producers and consumers can costlessly observe the bid and ask prices quoted by alternative market makers, all trade will occur with the market maker that offers the best bid and ask prices. Bertrand price cutting
will result in two possible outcomes, depending on the heterogeneity in transactions costs. If there is more
than one market maker who has the smallest per unit transactions cost, price competition will result in a
zero-profit equilibrium where the bid-ask spread equals the per unit transactions cost of the most efficient
market maker. The division of trade among the competing most efficient market makers is indeterminate.
If the most efficient market maker has a strictly lower per unit transactions cost than the next most efficient
market maker, the most efficient market maker can earn positive profits by charging a bid-ask spread equal
to the per unit transactions cost of the next most efficient market maker.
However we think a model of sequential entry into market making provides a better approximation of
reality, as we will see in the examples we discuss in the next section. In addition, the fixed costs associated
with entry into market making are likely to be substantial. These fixed costs include advertising costs to
make everyone aware of the market maker’s identity and where his prices are posted.
In this case, the outcome of a sequential entry process depends on the order in which potential market
makers arrive and enter the market. If the first potential entrant can enter profitably, he will do so according
to a modified version of theory presented in the previous section. The first market maker will enter if his
expected profits from market making exceed the fixed costs of entry. However his expected profits will be
lower than the values computed in the previous section since he will anticipate that potential challengers
will eventually arrive and force him to limit price, i.e. to reduce his bid-ask spread to the point where
the most efficient challenger will not expect to make a profit after the challenger’s fixed costs of entry are
taken into account. Indeed, a sufficiently efficient challenger could even displace the existing incumbent.
In either case the entry decision of the first potential entrant depends on his beliefs about how long he will
be able to earn monopoly rents from market making before these rents are partially or fully dissipated by
the arrival of more efficient challengers for the position of market maker. A full analysis of this dynamic
“entry game” is beyond the scope of this paper. We simply note that the combination of fixed entry costs
and post entry competition for the position of market maker will narrow the range of parameter values
for which entry by a market maker is profitable. The precise parameter configurations for which entry is
profitable will depend on a specification of the fixed costs of entry, and the first potential entrant’s beliefs
about the arrival of challengers for the position of market making.
It should be clear from the analysis in the previous section that any additional competition between
potential market makers, in addition to the competition that already exists between middlemen and market
32

makers, will result in further narrowing of bid-ask spreads and additional welfare gains for producers
and consumers. Total profits earned by middlemen and market makers will generally fall as a result of
additional competition from new potential market makers, but this fall in profits will be more than offset
by the increase in expected surplus accruing to consumers and producers.
The stationary equilibrium model used in this paper is not a fully satisfactory framework in which to
study the issue of competition between market makers. A model with stochastic arrivals of potential challengers might be one way to incorporate these dynamics, however there difficult issues to consider when
there are multiple market makers and consumers are not all instantaneously informed of their existence
and bid and ask prices. If producers and consumers need to search in order to discover the bid and ask
prices charged by competing market makers, then there is the possibility of “market fragmentation.” In
this case, competing market makers may not be very different from competing middlemen: producers and
consumers will not know which market maker is offering the best bid-ask spread without undertaking a
sequential search process to obtain the best price quotes, and most of the benefits of having a single market
place where credible bid and ask prices are quoted could be lost.
In addition, if there are elements of increasing returns to scale and network externalities associated
with having larger populations of traders (which enable a market maker to have a “thicker” and more
“continuous” market), there may be “natural monopoly” elements to market making. In such an environment the equilibrium outcome may be indeterminate, or there may be multiple equilibria. Caillaud and
Jullien (2001) analyzed the “chicken and egg” problems arising from the network externalities involved
in competition between market makers (or “matchmakers”) in a different framework. These issues are
worthy of further exploration, but they require a more complicated model than we have employed here. A
more realistic model will have to account for various types of non-stationarities and network externalities
in order to yield a more satisfactory dynamic analysis of competition in market making in which issues of
market fragmentation and natural monopoly can be addressed.

5 Applications
The theory in this paper is applicable to a wide range of asset and commodity markets. In this section we
look at four markets: the market for commodities in a World War II P.O.W. camp, the U.S. equity market,
the U.S. Treasury market, and the U.S. steel market. In the first three markets we observe the co-existence
of both middlemen and market makers. In the fourth we observe only middlemen despite recent attempts

33

by Enron and two potential web-based market makers, e-STEEL and MetalSite, to enter the market. In
light of the quotation at the beginning of the article, we discuss why the brokerage firm Cantor Fitzgerald
was able to become a market maker in the U.S. Treasury bond market whereas the two steel dot-coms have
not become market makers.
Perhaps one of the best-known examples (at least among economists) of the co-existence of middle
men and market makers is the World War II P.O.W. camp described by Radford (1945). In this camp,
prisoners traded a variety of commodities among themselves: canned milk, jam, biscuits, and chocolate.
In the absence of fiat money, cigarettes became a form of currency. Trade was facilitated by “Exchange
and Mart notice boards” on which bid and ask prices for different goods were posted. When a deal was
consummated, the posting was crossed out. Radford notes, “The public and semi-permanent record of
transactions led to cigarette prices being well known and thus tending to equality throughout the camp.” In
addition to the Exchange and Mart, middlemen were active in the camp, although they were viewed with
disdain:
Despite the fact that his very existence was proof to the contrary, the middleman was held to
be redundant in view of the existence of the Shop and the Exchange and Mart. ... And middlemen as a group were blamed for reducing prices. Opinion not withstanding, most people
dealt with a middleman, whether consciously or unconsciously, at some time or another. (Radford, 1945, p. 199)
In this camp the Exchange and Mart served the role as a market maker. Both current and historical bid
and ask prices were publicly and costlessly observable. As our model predicts, these middlemen did help
reduce ask prices. Radford does not mention whether middlemen had any effect on bid prices.
In the contemporary market for U.S. equities there is substantial interest in the question of whether
entry of middlemen can reduce the bid-ask spread of market makers such as the New York Stock Exchange
(NYSE). The NYSE is a collection of market makers known as specialists. Each specialist is responsible
for creating a market in one or more individual securities. Each holds inventories, posts publicly observable
bid and ask prices, and reports a history of past transaction prices.6 However there is also an active set of
middlemen commonly referred to as the “over the counter” market (OTC). Pirrong (2000) estimates that
the OTC market accounts for only 8 percent of the volume and 10 percent of the transactions in NYSElisted securities. Despite this small market share, the OTC market does appear to play the role of the
6 Typically a specialist on the NYSE posts prices for only relatively small transactions. Almost all large transactions are
negotiated “upstairs” via middlemen; only after the deal is consummated is the transaction price publicly posted.

34

competitive fringe as in our model. Although the evidence is mixed, several empirical studies, such as
Battalio (1997), document that the quoted bid-ask spread for NYSE-listed securities tightens when “third
market” dealer/brokers enter and compete against the NYSE to execute trades.
The NYSE also faces increasing competition from other potential market makers such as R. Steven
Wunsch’s computerized Arizona Stock Exchange (www.azx.com) and the Cincinnati Stock Exchange. In
recent years the advent of “electronic communication networks” (ECNs), competition from computerized foreign exchanges, and a change to a more pro-competitive regulatory regime at the Securities and
Excahnge Commission (SEC) have subjected the NYSE to much more competitive pressure than it has
experienced in the past.7 This has forced the NYSE to make changes it had previously resisted such as
repealing “Rule 390”, moving toward 24-hour trading, and allowing prices to be quoted in decimals rather
than in 1/8 increments.8 Battalio, Greene, and Jennings (1997) studied the effect of a set of rule changes
in the early 1990s that made it easier to trade NYSE-listed securities on regional exchanges. They found
that, after the rule changes, bid-ask spreads decreased for about two-thirds of the securities in their sample.
Although the narrowing of bid-ask spreads that Battalio (1997) and Battalio, Greene, and Jennings
(1997) find in response to increased competition is consistent with our model, it runs counter to the intuition of a set of models in the financial intermediation literature. See, for example, Easley, Kiefer, and
O’Hara (1996) and Fong, Madhavan, and Swan (1999). These papers emphasize the potential adverse
selection problem associated with competition between intermediaries. These models generally consider
two types of traders: informed and uninformed. If the middlemen are able to selectively trade with only the
uniformed traders (e.g. by only accepting small orders), then the market maker is left trading with only the
informed traders. This “cream skimming” by the middlemen leaves the market maker at an informational
disadvantage against the informed traders. In response, the market maker must widen his bid-ask spread
in order not to systematically lose money.
Within this adverse selection literature, Pirrong’s (2000) model is perhaps the closest to ours. He
considers the effect of competition between a monopolist market maker and a “third market” consisting of
middlemen. He focuses on the effects of entry by middlemen on an initial equilibrium with a monopolist
market maker, whereas we focus on the effect of the entry of a monopolist market maker on an initial search
equilibrium where there is free entry and exit of middlemen. Pirrong’s model has differently informed
traders, and studies whether the creation of a third market results in free riding on the price discovery

provided by a monopolist market maker. The NYSE has advanced this latter argument to the SEC as its
rationale for the need to limit the formation of third markets and competing exchanges. However, Pirrong
concludes that “although free entry to the exchange would maximize welfare, encouragement of a free
entry third market may be a second-best response to exchange market power” (p. 2).
Our model is silent on this adverse selection problem, and, as noted above, does not address potential
network externalities associated with market making. In our model, free entry by middlemen provides a
significant competitive threat to a monopolist market maker, forcing it to substantially reduce its bid-ask
spreads. This results in a significant welfare gain to both buyers and sellers. Since middlemen undercut the
market maker’s quoted prices, their entry increases price dispersion compared with the initial equilibrium.
From the monopolist market maker’s point of view, this additional price dispersion is unnecessary and
evidence that the middlemen are free riding on its price discovery; however, from the point of view of
producers and consumers, any additional costs associated with the extra price dispersion are outweighed
by the benefits of the reduction in the market maker’s bid-ask spreads.
Thirty years ago the secondary market for U.S. Treasury securities was dominated by middlemen.
Trades between dealers were made through a small set of inter-dealer brokerage firms. Trades were conducted over the telephone, and dealers did not know the prices other dealers received, nor were customers
(e.g., pension funds) shown the prices dealers faced. However, in 1972 Cantor Fitzgerald, a brokerage
firm, began allowing dealers to see transactable bid and ask prices on computer screens. Dealers could
now see the prices other dealers received. As the quotation at the beginning of the article states, by making
its prices transparent, Cantor Fitzgerald “vaulted to nearly monopolistic pre-eminence in the bond market.” In 1990, in response to calls from the SEC and customers for greater market transparency, several
of the major brokers in the inter-dealer market formed a joint venture, GovPX, to consolidate inter-dealer
data. Once consolidated, these data are transmitted in real time to customers through vendors such as
Bloomberg. In our view the Treasury market has been transformed from primarily a dealer market like the
one described in section 2 to a market with competitive market making like the one described in section 4.
Today trades in the inter-dealer market are made through brokers either by telephone or over an electronic transaction system (ETS). Like the market maker in our model, ETSs allow dealers to post transactable prices and quantities and execute trades electronically. The Bond Market Association (2001) reports there are currently 33 ETSs active in the U.S. Treasury market, but the two largest ETSs, eSpeed, Inc.
and BrokerTec Global, LLC, dominate the market.9 The Bond Market Association reports that although
9 Cantor

Fitzgerald owns 55 percent of eSpeed. BrokerTec is run and owned by a consortium of large Wall Street firms.

36

the ETSs are capturing a large share of trades in the most liquid issues, trades in less liquid issues still
take place primarily over the telephone. We are told by Treasury market participants that the telephone
market is helpful in getting information about the depth of the market that is not always available on an
ETS. Although our model does not explicitly account for liquidity, one can stretch the model’s intuition
by interpreting a decrease in liquidity as an increase in the cost of carrying out a transaction. This would
suggest that liquid securities are associated with low km ’s relative to k whereas the reverse holds true for
less liquid securities.
Although precise data on the fraction of inter-dealer trades executed electronically are unavailable,
one (albeit noisy) way to measure the movement away from telephone trading and toward ETSs is to view
the fraction of total inter-dealer trades not captured by GovPX. Neither eSpeed nor BrokerTec reports its
trades to GovPX; therefore the trades recorded by GovPX are dominated by the telephone brokers. All
inter-dealer broker trades, including those made through the ETSs are reported to the Federal Reserve Bank
of New York. Fleming (2001) reports that GovPX’s coverage of the total market has fallen in recent years
from 65 percent in 1997 to 57 percent in 1998 and 52 percent in 1999. Although certainly not conclusive,
this evidence suggests that the ETSs’ market share is increasing.
Although our model predicts that the rise in electronic trading should lead to a decrease in bid-ask
spreads in the inter-dealer market, bid-ask spreads are generally higher today than they were in 1997. In
particular bid-ask spreads widened substantially in 1998 during the Russian crisis and the near collapse of
Long Term Capital Management and have not returned to pre-crisis levels. We do not have access to the
high-quality transactions data necessary to tease out the effect of the ETSs on bid-ask spreads, taking into
account other broad market events (e.g., the reduction in U.S. Treasury debt during the second half of the
Clinton administration and the Treasury’s buy-back program).
Just as ETSs have transformed the U.S. Treasury market securities from one dominated by middlemen
to one dominated by market makers, it is not hard to imagine similar conversions happening in other
markets. In particular, we believe the U.S. steel market is a likely candidate for such a transformation.
Spulber’s (1996a) model of a dealer market provides a reasonable caricature of the current state of the
U.S. steel market. It is a highly competitive and unconcentrated market where over 5,000 “steel service
centers” (SSCs) play the role of middlemen between buyers and sellers of steel products. In 1998 three
potential market makers – Enron, e-STEEL, and MetalSite – entered the market. None has yet been
successful in garnering a significant share of transactions.10 From November 2000 to December 2001,
10 Enron

declared bankruptcy in December 2001. Although both e-STEEL and MetalSite are still in business, neither firm is

37

Enron attempted to become a market maker in steel: it posted bid and ask prices on the web for coil steel
and held inventory in Chicago to ensure market liquidity. However, as we are writing this paper (in the
Winter of 2002), it is our understanding from discussions with executives in the steel industry (but outside
of Enron) that the prices currently posted on the web for Enron steel are several months out of date and that
Enron is exiting the steel industry. As far as we know, Enron went out of business for reasons unrelated to
its maker making position in steel.
In contrast to Enron, neither e-STEEL nor MetalSite claims to be an explicit market maker: neither holds its own inventories, and neither posts its own bid and ask prices. Instead, these sites operate
like the Exchange and Mart in the P.O.W. camp discussed above or like the “information gatekeepers”
studied by Baye and Morgan (2001). Information gatekeepers are web sites, such as Shopper.com or
Mortgage-quotes.com, that centralize dispersed price information and reduce search costs by allowing

buyers and sellers to post bid and ask prices on the web.
We can reinterpret the market maker in our model as an information gatekeeper that charges commissions to buyers and sellers rather than buying and selling on its own account and charging its own bid-ask
spreads. Suppose the gatekeeper charges a per unit commission or transaction fee τ to buyers and sellers to
post prices on the site. Thus if a buyer posts a bid of b and succeeds in transacting, the total per unit cost he
actually pays would be b

τ. Similarly, if a seller posts an ask price of a and transacts, the seller’s actual

ceives a per unit sales price equal to 1 2

bm , which is the same price the seller would have obtained

from a monopolist market maker. Symmetrical remarks apply to buyers. It is immaterial whether a market
has a monopolist market maker or a monopolist gatekeeper: both lead to exactly the same equilibrium
outcome.11 There can be no dispersion in the bid and ask prices posted on the gatekeeper’s website, but
capturing a significant share of transactions. MetalSite shut down its website and all trading in June 2001, but relaunched it in
late November 2001. e-STEEL is now NewView and has switched its focus to licensing inter-enterprise software.
11 The gatekeeper can use a variety of different commission structures to implement the same outcome as a monopolist market
maker. For example, the gatekeeper might charge nothing to buyers who post bids on the site, but a commission equal to

38

there will be price dispersion in the dealer market due to the search frictions.
The crucial difference between the two steel dot-coms and the ETSs in the U.S. Treasury market is
price transparency. In the Treasury market dealers must post transactable, “take it or leave it” prices. The
ETSs in the inter-dealer Treasury market are designed so that no negotiation over price occurs (although
negotiation over quantity may still occur). Posted prices are available to all subscribers, and the history
of past transactions is made public. In contrast, e-STEEL and MetalSite are designed as “computerized
chat rooms” where private transactions are negotiated. Both websites allow buyers and sellers to post
prices, but next to each posted price is a “negotiate” or “counter-offer” button. From our discussions
with steel middlemen, we learned that these posted prices were much like the list price for a new car;
they represent first offers, not take-it-or-leave-it prices. Negotiation is expected. Consequently these
two websites are more akin to a computerized extension of the existing dealer or telephone market for
steel, but where individual deals are negotiated by typing messages into a computer terminal rather than
conducted over the telephone. To the extent that most producers and consumers in the steel market find
it easier to negotiate verbally by telephone than by typing messages over a computer terminal, e-STEEL
and MetalSite not only fail to perform the role of market maker, but may indeed constitute an inferior
technology for intermediation in the dealer market compared with the pre-existing telephone technology.
Furthermore, neither e-STEEL nor MetalSite posts historical transaction data, and both allow buyers
and sellers to limit who can view their own postings. There is a question on the “frequently asked questions” page of the e-STEEL web site: “Does e-STEEL create pricing transparency?” The posted answer
is “Since e-STEEL is not an auction, your pricing remains private. e-STEEL preserves your current way
of doing business since online negotiations and transactions between you and your trading partners are
kept private and secure.” This emphasis on privacy made it difficult to learn about the current market price
of steel from visiting e-STEEL. We conclude that these two web sites are simply offering an alternative
communication channel to the telephone to enable buyers and sellers to negotiate privately. Neither fulfills
the role of a market maker or an information gatekeeper that posts publicly observable and transactable
bid and ask prices. This may be part of the reason that these firms have not been successful in gaining a

would place asks equal to am . The price received by sellers net of commission is then the same as the bid price bm that a
monopolist market maker would choose.

6 Conclusions
This paper has developed a theory of competitive exchange in which the microstructure of exchange is
determined endogenously. We have done this by introducing a fourth type of agent, market makers, into
the equilibrium search model with competitive middlemen introduced by Spulber (1996a). Middlemen
and market makers represent complementary and competitive exchange institutions: market makers post
publicly observable bid and ask prices, whereas prices quoted by middlemen in the dealer market constitute private information that can only be obtained through a costly search process. We have focused on
the effect of entry by a monopolist market maker on an initial equilibrium where there is free entry by
competitive middlemen.

Figure 8: Summary of Equilibria, δ

D2

Figure 8 summarizes the range of equilibrium outcomes predicted by the model. The type of equilibrium outcome depends on three key parameters: the search cost parameter δ, the per unit transactions cost
of the market maker km , and the per unit transactions cost of the most efficient middleman k. The left-hand

  

panel displays the four possible equilibrium regimes that occur for various combinations of the km k parameters when the search cost is fixed at δ

D 2. The model predicts that no market maker will be present

if km is sufficiently high relative to k (region 1), and that no middlemen will exist if k is sufficiently large

  

relative to km (regions 3 and 4). Region 2 represents the intermediate slice of km k values that permit the
coexistence of middlemen and market makers. The right-hand panel shows the share of trade handled by
the market maker. In region 2 this share increases linearly in k for any fixed km or, conversely, declines

40

linearly in km in for any fixed k. We can conceptualize the steel industry as corresponding to values of

 k  k
m

in region 1 where entry by a market maker is currently unprofitable. In the securities industry, entry

  

barriers to middlemen and other market makers created by the NYSE correspond to values of km k that
are close to region 3 where the market maker engages in limit pricing; that is, it chooses the largest possible bid-ask spread subject to the constraint that this spread is not sufficiently high to encourage significant
entry of dealer/brokers into the OTC market.
We recognize that there are several limitations to our analysis that qualify the types of conclusions we
can draw from it. First, as noted in sections 4 and 5, our model does not account for information asymmetries or network externalities, which could affect our conclusions about whether entry by middlemen
or competing market makers always benefits buyers and sellers in the market. A richer analysis would be
required to determine whether some intermediaries might free ride on the price discovery provided by a
market maker, so that market fragmentation could occur and raise traders’ search costs and reduce welfare.
If there are network externalities in addition to the information problems, there may be conditions under
which market making has elements of natural monopoly.
A second limitation is that we assumed that all exchange must be intermediated by either a middleman or a market maker. As we noted in the introduction, only half of the volume of trade in steel occurs
through middlemen; the rest does not occur through market makers but through direct transactions between producers and consumers. Hendershott and Zhang (2001) study an extension of Spulber’s (1996a)
model in which a monopolist producer can sell directly to consumers or through a middleman. Direct sales
involve lower search costs than intermediated sales. In equilibrium, the market segments. In a result analogous to ours, high-valuation consumers purchase directly from the producer, and intermediate-valuation
consumers choose to search for better prices in the dealer market.
A third limitation of our analysis is that we constrained supply and demand for the commodity for both
market makers and middlemen to be equal in every period. As a result, these agents have no inventory
holdings in our model. An important function of intermediaries is to hold inventory to provide a buffer
stock that offers their customers liquidity at times when there is an imbalance between supply and demand
(see Spulber, 1996b). In the securities business, liquidity means being able to buy or sell a reasonable
quantity of shares on short notice. In the steel market, liquidity is also associated with a demand for
“immediacy” so that a customer can be guaranteed of receiving shipment of an order within a few days of
placement. Lacking inventories and stockouts, this model cannot be used to analyze the important role of
intermediaries in providing liquidity.
41

Although our model is highly simplified and stylized, it provides insights into the organization of a
variety of different asset and commodities markets. Consider the two puzzles raised in the introduction.
One puzzle was to explain how entry could be profitable even if middlemen uniformly undercut the market
maker’s publicly posted bid and ask prices. Our explanation is that even though it is common knowledge
that middlemen offer better prices, the highest-valuation buyers and lowest-cost sellers still find it optimal
to trade immediately at these prices rather than incur the search costs involved in trying to find a better
price in the dealer market.
The other puzzle was to explain why market makers intermediate a significant share of trade in financial
assets such as bonds and stocks, but virtually none of the trade in steel. Our model suggests that an
explanation for this puzzle is that transactions costs for market making are high for commodities such as
steel but low for financial assets such as bonds. However this explanation may seem tautological. Why
would transactions costs associated with market making be so high for commodities such as steel and so
low for financial assets such as bonds?
Recall that km can be thought of as including a “rebate” to buyers and sellers to offset any transactions
costs involved in transacting with the market maker. In financial assets such as bonds and agricultural
commodities such as wheat and pork bellies, buyers and sellers (or producers and consumers) may be
relatively sophisticated and may be used to conducting transactions through a market maker at a central
exchange. Thus, their “hassle” or transactions costs may be fairly low, resulting in a low value of km
relative to k. However, in the steel market, traders have little experience in conducting transactions over
an exchange. They may perceive relatively high transactions costs to doing business with a market maker
compared with their local SSC. Thus a new entrant to the steel market may face a different culture than
did the initial entrants to the bond or wheat markets, and this difference in culture could translate into a
higher effective transactions cost km as explained in the beginning of section 3.
However, the increasing penetration of computers and the World Wide Web seems to be gradually
changing the culture in the steel market, lowering km and creating the possibility for profitable entry. As
we noted, there have recently been several unsuccessful attempts at entry by potential market makers. This
may indicate that technology and associated cultural changes are reducing km relative to k, moving the
market toward the boundary between region 1 (where entry by a market maker is unprofitable) and region
2 (where entry is profitable). From our own observation of the steel market, we think it is only a matter
of time before successful entry does occur. Also, some of the problems experienced by the first wave of
entrants into the steel market may have been due to the general effects of the dot.com crash of 2001-02,
42

and some of these entrants (such as Enron) might have successed in entering the steel market had it not
been for problems in their other lines of business.
More generally, our model provides new insights into how the information revolution could affect
the microstructure of a variety of different markets. We expect that improvements in computing and
communications technologies will tend to drive all three parameters δ, k, and km toward zero. In this
case we expect that most markets will ultimately be in a configuration near the origin in region 2 of
figure 8. Our theoretical results predict that middlemen and market makers will coexist, with each handling
approximately half of the total volume of trade.
