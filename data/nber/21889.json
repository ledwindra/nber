    "abstract": "\n\nA well-developed theoretical literature \u2014 dating back at least to Nordhaus (1969) \u2014 has analyzed optimal patent policy design.  We re-present the core trade-off of the Nordhaus model and highlight an empirical question which emerges from the Nordhaus framework as a key input into optimal patent policy design: namely, what is the elasticity of R&D investment with respect to the patent term?  We then review the \u2014 surprisingly small \u2014 body of empirical evidence that has been developed on this question over the nearly half century since the publication of Nordhaus's book.\n\n",
