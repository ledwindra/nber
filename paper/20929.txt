Childhood Medicaid Coverage and Later Life Health Care Utilization

NBER Working Paper No. 20929
February 2015, Revised October 2015

ABSTRACT
Policy-makers have argued that providing public health insurance coverage to the uninsured lowers
long-run costs by reducing the need for expensive hospitalizations and emergency department visits
later in life. In this paper, we provide evidence for such a phenomenon by exploiting a legislated
discontinuityin the cumulative number of years a child is eligible for Medicaid based on date of
birth. We find that having more years of Medicaid eligibility in childhood is associated with fewer
hospitalizations and emergency department visits in adulthood for blacks. Our effects are particularly
pronounced for hospitalizations and emergency department visits related to chronic illnesses and
those of patients living in low-income neighborhoods. Furthermore, we find evidence suggesting
that these effects are larger in states where the difference in the number of Medicaid-eligible years
across the cutoff birthdate is greater. Calculations suggest that lower rates of hospitalizations and
emergency department visits during one year in adulthood offset between 3 and 5 percent of the
initial costs of expanding Medicaid.

I. Introduction
One of the goals of publicly-subsidized health insurance is to improve the health of those without
insurance. The argument underlying this policy is straightforward: health insurance provides the
means to use more, and more timely, medical care, and because of this greater use of care, health
is improved. As a result, those who gain coverage may need fewer expensive hospital and
emergency department visits later in life due to their improved health, and these long term
changes in utilization may partially or completely offset the initial cost of insurance provision.
While the intuition behind this argument is strong, the empirical evidence to support it is
relatively weak. For example, the Oregon Medicaid Experiment did not find significant health
benefits from health insurance during the first two years of coverage and found that the provision
of Medicaid increased, rather than decreased, the use of costly hospital and emergency
department care (Finkelstein et al. 2012, Taubman et al. 2014).1
One limitation of the literature in this area is its relatively short time horizon. Most studies seek
to link health insurance to health contemporaneously, or for a few subsequent years. However,
the health benefits of insurance may be cumulative and revealed only after a sustained period of
insurance and regular use of medical care. In addition, certain types of medical care focus on
protecting the patient from future health risks and the payoffs from these types of preventive
services may not be evident until later in life. In both scenarios, shorter windows of analysis may
not be adequate to identify the health benefits insurance.
A second limitation of studies evaluating contemporaneous effects of public health insurance on
hospitalizations and emergency department visits is that they are unable to isolate the potential
health benefit of insurance from the increased access that results from insurance. For example,
they cannot separate an improvement in health due to insurance that could ultimately result in
fewer hospitalizations from the concurrent access effects of insurance that lower out-of-pocket
costs and induce greater use of care including hospitalizations. Even if an individual’s health
improves as a result of public insurance coverage, the access effect may dominate in the short
term, leading to higher utilization of medical services.

Medicaid coverage was associated with improvements in self-reported health, but no change in
physical and clinical health measures (Finkelstein et al. 2012, Baicker et al. 2013).

In this paper, we address these issues by examining whether the expansion of Medicaid in the
late 1980s and early 1990s improved the health later in life of those affected. Specifically, we
exploit plausibly exogenous variation by birthdate in the cumulative number of years an
individual was eligible for public health insurance coverage. To phase in the Medicaid
expansions, Congress specified that several eligibility expansions for low-income children
applied only to children born after September 30, 1983. As a result, children born before
September 30, 1983 experienced lower rates of Medicaid eligibility and fewer Medicaid-eligible
years in childhood than children born immediately following the cutoff. This discontinuity in
eligibility was first identified and used by Card and Shore-Sheppard (2004) to examine
contemporaneous changes in insurance coverage. Wherry and Meyer (forthcoming) later
demonstrated that the policy led to cumulative differences in childhood eligibility. They
estimated that a child in a family with income just under the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) gained
approximately five additional years of Medicaid eligibility during childhood if she were born on
October 1, 1983 rather than September 30, 1983. Black children were particularly likely to
benefit from the Medicaid expansions, gaining on average more than twice the number of
Medicaid-eligible years of white children.
We exploit this policy discontinuity as a source of exogenous variation in Medicaid eligibility in
order to evaluate the long-term effects of Medicaid. The outcomes we examine are hospital and
emergency department (ED) visits derived from administrative data from all states that make
such data available. These databases capture the universe of hospitalizations or ED visits in each
state for a given year and provide sufficiently large sample sizes to detect changes in utilization
among the young (e.g., age 25) population that we study. In addition to birth year and month, the
data also provide information on other patient characteristics including race and median income
of the zipcode of residence. This information allows us to examine changes in hospitalization
and ED use among groups that were especially likely to be affected by the change in Medicaid
policy.
An important contribution of our study is that we are able to isolate the potential health benefits
of insurance from any access effects of health insurance on hospitalizations and ED visits. We
are able to disentangle the health effect of insurance on utilization from changes in out-of-pocket
costs by analyzing the hospitalizations and use of ED care of young adults later in life, when

	  

2

there are no longer policy-driven differences in Medicaid eligibility or out-of-pocket costs
between our treatment and control groups that could drive utilization patterns. We examine the
effects of coverage one year after the cohorts have experienced the additional Medicaid coverage
(at age 15) and ten years later (at age 25), allowing us to capture both immediate and longer-term
effects.
Our study is also informative on the dynamic technology of the production of health, a topic of
great recent research interest. For example, Heckman (2007) models current capabilities, which
include cognitive and non-cognitive ability and health, as a function of initial values and all past
and current investments. While he points to several features of this function that research has
elucidated, other features have not been empirically determined. Understanding this process is
important for example when designing policies to ameliorate disadvantage. We are able to
estimate the effects of investments in child health for a disadvantaged population in the pre-teen
and early teen years on health over ten years later. We thus advance our understanding of the
process of how health at one age is altered by investments at another.
We find no immediate effects of the expansions on health care utilization at age 15. However, we
find sizeable effects of Medicaid eligibility in childhood on hospitalizations and emergency
department visits at age 25 among black cohorts who gained coverage. Black cohorts born
immediately after the cutoff are estimated to experience approximately 7 to 15 percent fewer
hospitalizations and 2 to 5 percent fewer emergency department visits at age 25 relative to those
born just before the cutoff. Our results are particularly pronounced for hospitalizations and
emergency department visits related to chronic illnesses and among patients from low-income
zip codes. Additionally, our analysis suggests that these effects are largest in states where the
discontinuity in the cumulative number of Medicaid eligible years is greatest. We do not find
reductions in the utilization of non-blacks (who experienced smaller gains in Medicaid eligibility
at the birth date cutoff), nor do we find effects for hospitalizations related to appendicitis or
injury, two conditions that are unlikely to be affected by access to care in childhood. Placebo
tests using earlier birth cohorts to estimate breaks at non-discontinuity points indicate that any
discontinuities at these false “cutoff” points are small relative to the effects we estimate at the
true birth date cutoff.

Our results provide several insights that are relevant to current policy debates surrounding the
provision of public health insurance and the role of government in expanding coverage. First, our
estimates indicate that between 3 and 5 percent of the initial cost of the Medicaid expansions for
children were “offset” by lower hospitalization and emergency department usage at age 25 alone,
with a substantial fraction of these cost savings accruing to the government in the form of lower
hospital payments for publicly-insured patients. If these effects persist, then the size of the cost
offset is likely to be even greater. Second, our results highlight the importance of evaluating
these programs over a longer time period. Indeed, we find no impact of Medicaid coverage in our
analysis of the “immediate” effect at age 15, but do find effects later in life at age 25. These
findings suggest that the benefits of insurance may only materialize over a long horizon.
II. Background
High-quality analyses of Medicaid eligibility expansions for children consistently show that
Medicaid increases health care utilization, including hospitalizations, in the short term.2
However, there are fewer studies of the effects of gaining Medicaid on children’s health and the
evidence from this literature is mixed. A number of studies using parental reports of child health
find no evidence of improvement under public insurance, while several papers document
significant declines in child mortality.3 Thus, the effect of gaining health insurance on health
remains an important but unanswered question.
One limitation of studies seeking to assess the effect of insurance on health is that they examine
how coverage affects health, for example, as measured by hospital admissions, immediately after
or within a few years of the coverage expansion. If the health benefits of insurance are realized
later, then a contemporaneous or short-run analysis may miss much of the effect of insurance.

See evidence of increased hospital use in Dafny and Gruber (2005), Currie and Gruber (1996a)
and Boudreaux, Golberstein, and McAlpine (2014). In addition, Currie and Gruber (1996a), Card
and Shore-Sheppard (2004), and Currie, Decker and Lin (2008) present evidence indicating an
increase in annual doctor visits under expanded public insurance.

For example, Currie, Decker and Lin (2008), Currie and Gruber (1995), De La Mata (2012),
and Racine et al. (2001) find no change in subjective measures of child health such as child
health status and activity limitations. Meanwhile, Currie and Gruber (1996a, 1996b), GoodmanBacon (2014), Howell et al. (2010), and Wherry and Meyer (forthcoming) find significant effects
on infant or child mortality. Not all studies, however, find mortality improvements; Decker,
Almond, and Simon (2015) find no evidence of changes in maternal and child mortality under
the rollout of Medicaid. See Howell and Kenney (2012) for further discussion of this literature.

emerging literature on the longer-term effects of health insurance coverage in childhood on later
life outcomes has begun to address this issue. Wherry and Meyer (forthcoming) examine the
later life mortality of cohorts born before and after the 1983 cutoff date specified in many
expansions of Medicaid. They provide evidence linking this increase in childhood eligibility to a
later decline in teenage mortality for black children who were more likely to gain eligibility
under the expansions than white children. Boudreaux, Golberstein and McAlpine (2014) use
variation in the timing of the introduction of the Medicaid program across states in the 1960s to
identify long-term effects among cohorts with different exposure to the program. They find that
those who gained access to Medicaid early in childhood were less likely to report having a
chronic illness as an adult. Brown, Kowalski, and Lurie (2015) also use state-level variation in
the timing of the Medicaid expansions for children in the 1980s to examine long-term effects and
find that cohorts who gained coverage have higher wages, receive lower earned income tax
credit payouts, have higher graduation rates and lower mortality as adults. Also relying on statelevel variation, Cohodes et al. (forthcoming) find that cohorts who gained coverage in childhood
as a result of these Medicaid expansions have higher educational attainment, and Miller and
Wherry (2015) find that cohorts whose mothers had higher eligibility rates for prenatal coverage
while the cohort was in utero had better health outcomes and fewer hospitalizations in adulthood
related to chronic health conditions, as well as higher rates of high school graduation.
In this paper, we add to this literature by exploiting the discontinuity in Medicaid eligibility and
coverage among those born around September 30, 1983 to study the effect of childhood
Medicaid eligibility on hospitalizations and emergency department visits at age 25. There is only
limited study of the long term health effects of Medicaid eligibility, so our paper adds to this
literature. In addition, with the exception of Wherry and Meyer (forthcoming), all previous
papers on the long-term effects of Medicaid coverage use state and year level variation in
Medicaid policy to examine long-term outcomes. Although this empirical approach has been
used many times in the literature, some authors have pointed out its limitations (e.g., the
estimates tend to be sensitive to the inclusion of state-specific trends; see Dave et al. 2008). The
regression discontinuity design we employ allows us to examine the effects of childhood
Medicaid coverage in a way that is arguably more credible because it does not rely on using
policy changes at the state level as an instrument for eligibility.

III. The Policy Discontinuity
Discontinuity in Eligibility
Prior to the 1980s, eligibility for Medicaid for non-disabled children was primarily limited to
children in families receiving cash welfare under the Aid to Dependent Families with Children
(AFDC) program. Recipients of AFDC benefits were primarily single-mother families with very
low income levels, often well below the poverty line.4 Beginning in the mid-1980s, Congress
took steps to expand eligibility for Medicaid to children not participating in AFDC who would
otherwise be ineligible for Medicaid benefits. In a series of legislative acts, eligibility for
Medicaid was expanded to all children with family incomes at or below the poverty line,
regardless of family structure or participation in the AFDC program.
In an effort to phase in changes in Medicaid eligibility, Congress specified that many of the
legislative changes applied only to children born after September 30, 1983. This provision meant
that children born just before and after this birthdate cutoff faced very different eligibility criteria
for Medicaid during their childhood years. Wherry and Meyer (forthcoming) simulate childhood
eligibility for public health insurance for cohorts born on either side of this birthdate cutoff.5
They show that this unique feature of the expansions led to a large discontinuity in the number of
years of Medicaid eligibility during childhood for cohorts born at this birthdate.
Given the nature the expansions, the discontinuity was largest for children with family incomes
below the poverty line and above AFDC income levels. Figure 1 displays the average number of
years of childhood eligibility for public insurance by birth month cohort for children in families

	  Income limits for the AFDC program were established by states and ranged from 14 to 79
percent of the federal poverty line in 1989 (U.S. General Accounting Office 1989).	  
5
The authors use a random sample of children of ages 0-17 from each year of the 1981-1988
March Supplement to the Current Population Survey (CPS) and estimate eligibility for this
pooled sample if born in each month between October 1979 and September 1987. They employ
detailed federal and state public health insurance eligibility rules for the years 1979 to 2005 to
estimate eligibility status for each month during childhood through age 17. This simulation holds
family characteristics, including state of residence, family structure and size, parent employment
and family income, constant over the child’s lifetime. See Wherry and Meyer (forthcoming) for
additional information.

with incomes below 150 percent of the federal poverty line. The magnitude of the discontinuity
in childhood eligibility at the September 30, 1983 cutoff is largest for children in families with
incomes between 75 and 100 percent of the poverty line. The gain represents an additional 4.6
years of eligibility during childhood. Children with incomes between 50 and 75 percent of
poverty, as well as those with incomes between 25 and 50 percent of poverty, also experience
sizeable gains with an additional 3.4 and 2.0 years of eligibility, respectively.
Figure 2 reveals that the gain in eligibility was primarily concentrated at ages 8 to 14 for children
born immediately after the birthdate cutoff. This graph plots the share of the September versus
October 1983 birth cohorts eligible for public health insurance at each age during childhood by
race. Eligibility levels are similar for the two cohorts prior to age 8 and again starting at age 15.
These cohorts were approximately 8 years of age at the implementation of the Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA90), which required all state Medicaid programs to cover
children under age 19 born after September 30, 1983. This legislation was responsible for most
of the discontinuity. Later, the State Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) authorized
state expansions of public health insurance to children in higher income families. The CHIP
expansions served to close the gap in public eligibility for cohorts born on either side of the
cutoff at around age 15. We examine health care utilization for cohorts born just before and after
September 30, 1983 following the differential gain in Medicaid eligibility at age 15 and then 10
years later at age 25.
We also examine differential effects of the expansions by race and by state of residence. Black
children were more likely to gain eligibility under the expansions (Table 1) due to their family
incomes. On average, black children born in October versus September 1983 were 17 percentage
points more likely to gain Medicaid eligibility. Among those who were made Medicaid-eligible,
the average gain in eligibility throughout childhood was 4.9 years. This is over twice the average
years of eligibility gained by non-black children, who experienced a 9 percentage point gain in
eligibility across the birth date threshold that led, on average, to 4.4 additional Medicaid-eligible
years throughout childhood.6
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
6

Wherry and Meyer (forthcoming) estimate eligibility gains by child race and state of residence
using a similar methodology but rely on a national sample that draws children from the CPS by
race and state cells. The estimates presented here differ slightly in that they rely on state-specific

	  

7

The gain in Medicaid eligibility for children born after the cutoff also varied by state due
primarily to differences in Medicaid policies in place before the expansions and differences in
state socioeconomic characteristics.7 For example, the impact of the requirement that states cover
all poor children would depend on both prior eligibility levels determined by the state’s AFDC
eligibility threshold (e.g. 14% FPL vs. 79% FPL) and the concentration of children in the state
with family incomes between AFDC eligibility thresholds and the poverty line.
Table 2 presents estimates of the average eligibility gain at the cutoff for each state in our study.8
These estimates were calculated using state-specific samples of children from the CPS and
therefore capture the average magnitude of the discontinuity at the cutoff given a state’s
eligibility rules and distribution of family characteristics. The size of the discontinuity in
eligibility varies from 0.05 years of eligibility in California to 1.33 years of eligibility in
Arkansas.9 We use this variation to estimate differential effects across states associated with the
policy change.
Discontinuity in Coverage and Utilization
In addition to a demonstrated discontinuity in childhood eligibility, we also measure any
corresponding discontinuity in childhood coverage. It is important to bear in mind, however, that
even if they did not take active steps to enroll in the program, all children gaining eligibility for
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  

samples of all children ages 0-17 pooled for the 1981-1988 years of the March CPS. See the
appendix for additional discussion.
7
	  Although many of the expansions were first introduced as state options, Wherry and Meyer
(forthcoming) estimate that, when holding socioeconomic characteristics fixed, the majority of
the variation in eligibility at the September 30, 1983 cutoff across states resulted from the federal
requirement for all states to cover poor children born after this date rather than from optional
state expansions. See the appendix of their paper for additional information.
8
	  Some prior work has excluded Arizona from analyses of Medicaid expansions for children due
to its late implementation of Medicaid. We include Arizona in this analysis because, although
slow to implement Medicaid, the state provided government-supported health care for families
on AFDC both prior to and following the introduction of its Medicaid program in 1982 (Freeman
and Kirkman-Liff 1985). In addition, the federal mandate to expand eligibility for children born
after September 30, 1983 with family incomes up to the poverty line in 1991 applied to all states
including Arizona (Congressional Research Service 1988).	  
9
California represents a large population and experienced the smallest policy discontinuity in
our sample. For that reason, we also estimate models that exclude California from our analysis
(see Appendix Tables 4-8). As expected, specifications that exclude California tend to uncover
larger but somewhat less precise effects.

Medicaid had “conditional coverage” in that their expenses were covered in the event of
hospitalization or the need for costly medical care (Cutler and Gruber 1996). Not only could
eligibility be granted retroactively for a period of up to 3 months prior to the date of application,
but many states were giving children the opportunity to sign up for Medicaid at the sites where
they received health care (Congressional Research Service 1993). Since the value of Medicaid is
highest when children are sick, parents are likely to wait until medical care is needed to sign up
for coverage (Marton and Yelowitz 2014).
Card and Shore-Sheppard (2004) first examined changes in Medicaid enrollment for children
born after September 30, 1983 following the expansions in Medicaid eligibility. The authors
found Medicaid take up rates of between 8 and 11 percent among the newly eligible, with little
evidence of substitution of public for private coverage (i.e., crowd out). In an analysis of similar
spirit, we explore differences in the discontinuity in coverage by child race. We use the pooled
1992-1996 National Health Insurance Survey (NHIS) Health Insurance Supplements to examine
changes in reported Medicaid coverage during the last month for cohorts born after September
30, 1983 at ages 8-13.10 We estimate a simple regression discontinuity model and regress
Medicaid coverage on an indicator for birth cohorts October 1983 and later, a quadratic function
in birth month cohort interacted with this indicator, and a set of calendar month fixed effects. We
estimate this specification using 4-, 3-, and 2-year observation windows of birth month cohorts
on either side of the birthdate cutoff. Standard errors are heteroskedasticity-robust and are
allowed to be non-independent within birth month cohort cluster. We also use local linear
regression to estimate the discontinuity in Medicaid coverage at the September 30, 1983 cutoff
relying on two different data-driven optimal bandwidth selectors. More details on these
estimation methods are described later in Section V.
Figure 3 plots reported levels of Medicaid coverage for each birth month cohort with a 4-year
window on each side of the birthdate cutoff (centered at October 1983). The lines are fitted
values from a quadratic regression function in birth month cohort interacted with a dummy
variable for cohorts born after September 30, 1983. The graphs for blacks and, to a lesser extent,
for all races, show evidence of an increase in Medicaid coverage at the cutoff. When we look

As recommended by the National Center for Health Statistics, we exclude over-sampled
Hispanic respondents in the 1992 NHIS in this analysis; however, results are very similar when
these respondents are included.

separately at children in households with incomes below the poverty line, we see additional
visual evidence of a discontinuity in coverage.
Table 3 presents the corresponding regression estimates. For all races, we see some evidence of
an increase in Medicaid coverage with point estimates ranging between 1 and 2 percentage
points. However, for the most part, the estimates are not statistically significant. We do,
however, see strong evidence of an increase in Medicaid coverage for blacks of between 5 and 8
percentage points depending on the specification. The estimates are significantly different from
zero at the .05 level in four of five specifications and at the .10 level in the remaining case. Given
our previous estimate that 17 percent of black children gained eligibility at the cutoff, these
estimates represent a take-up rate on the order of approximately 29 to 47 percent. For nonblacks, we do not find a significant increase in Medicaid coverage and the point estimates are
much smaller, indicating less than a one-percentage point change in coverage and implying a
take-up rate of at most six percent. Examining children with families below the poverty line
only, we find an increase in Medicaid coverage of between 6 and 9 percentage points. The
estimates are significant at the .01 level in three of five specifications and at the .10 level in the
remaining two cases. We find no change among children in families with incomes above the
poverty line.
We also examined changes in reports of any insurance coverage during the last month (also in
Table 3). The change in overall insurance coverage for black children is not statistically
significant, but the coefficients suggest between a 2 and 5-percentage point increase among those
born just after the cutoff. The fact that the change in Medicaid coverage is larger than the change
in overall insurance coverage suggests that these expansions were associated with some crowdout (i.e., that some children enrolled in Medicaid who would otherwise have enrolled in private
insurance). In additional analyses, we examined changes in the probability of a doctor visit in the
last 12 months, as well as any short-stay hospital visits (not related to delivery) (see Appendix
Table 1). We find some evidence of increases in doctor visits among black children, although it
is not consistently significant across bandwidth choice. All figures associated with this analysis
may be found in the appendix (Appendix Figures 1-3).
Summary

	  

10

Changes in Medicaid eligibility and coverage documented in Figures 1 through 3 and Tables 1
through 3 lead to important empirical implications. There is clear variation in treatment by race,
poverty, and state, and the differences range from zero to substantial. Accordingly, if Medicaid
coverage has long-term effects on health and use of medical care such as hospitalization, then it
is plausible to expect that effects will vary in a way consistent with the variation in treatment.

IV. Data
To conduct our analysis, we combine discharge-level hospital data from three sources. First, we
use hospitalization data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) State Inpatient
Databases. We purchased all state databases available from HCUP for the 1999 and 2009 years
that contained information on the patient’s date of birth. These data provide discharge-level
information on all inpatient hospitalizations that occurred in acute care hospitals 1999 in
Arizona, Hawaii, Iowa, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, and Wisconsin, and in 2009, on
Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Hawaii, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Nebraska, New
Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Vermont, and Wisconsin.11 We
supplement these data with the census of hospital discharges that occurred in Texas and
California in 1999 and 2009, obtained from the Texas Department of State Health Services and
the California Health and Human Services Agency, resulting in the complete census of hospital
discharges for 9 states in 1999 and for 19 states in 2009.12 To our knowledge, this represents all
of the available hospital discharge data containing information on the patient’s date of birth for
these years.
In addition to hospital discharge data, we use data from all State Emergency Discharge
Databases available from HCUP in 2009 that include information on the patient’s date of birth.
These databases provide information on all outpatient emergency department visits that occurred
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
11

The inpatient data from Nebraska and North Carolina in 2009 do not have information on
patient race and are therefore excluded from all models run by race. Similarly, the inpatient data
from Oregon in 1999 do not include information on race and is excluded from all models run by
race for this year.
12
	  Psychiatric hospitals are included in the discharge data from California, Kentucky, Michigan,
Oregon, Texas, Utah, and Wisconsin. Other states include visits to psychiatric or other specialty
units within general acute care hospitals but not visits to specialty hospitals themselves.	  	  	  
	  

11

in Arizona, Hawaii, Iowa, Kentucky, New Jersey, New York, Utah and Wisconsin (obtained
from HCUP) and California (obtained from the California Health and Human Services Agency)
in 2009. These data cover all visits for which a patient was treated in an emergency department
and released the same day, rather than being admitted to the hospital. The data are only more
recently available and not available for 1999.
Both the hospital discharge and emergency department data contain information on the diagnoses
associated with each visit, total charges, and patient demographics including race and birth
month and year. In 2009 but not in 1999, we observe whether the patient is from a low-income
zip code (defined as a zip code with median income below $39,999).13 We classify primary
diagnoses as relating to “chronic” or “non-chronic” conditions using the Chronic Condition
Indicator software distributed by HCUP.14 We exclude hospitalizations and ED visits for
diagnoses related to pregnancy and delivery.
Combined, our hospitalization data include 689,546 discharge-level observations for diagnoses
not related to pregnancy and delivery and 3.9 million emergency department visits in 2009 for
patients born between 1979 and 1987. Our hospitalization sample covers approximately 36
percent of the national population in 1999 and 50 percent of the national population in 2009, and
our emergency department visit sample covers about 29 percent of the US population.15 These
large sample sizes are critical for our analysis because they allow us to detect changes in
hospitalizations and emergency department visits even among young populations with low
utilization rates and for conditions that are relatively rare.

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
13

Data obtained from HCUP contain a variable indicating that the median income of the
patient’s zip code is below $39,999. For data from Texas and California, we use the American
Community Survey and individual patient zip codes to create this variable following the same
criteria.

Downloaded from http://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/toolssoftware/chronic/chronic.jsp on
11/11/2014. The HCUP Chronic Conditions Indicator categorizes all diagnosis codes as chronic
or not chronic. The definition of a chronic condition requires that it lasts 12 months or longer and
that it either (1) places limitations on self-care, independent living, and social interactions; or (2)
needs ongoing intervention with medical products, services, and special equipment. The
classification was developed based on an existing body of work on the chronicity of conditions
and in consultation with a physician panel.

Table 4 presents descriptive statistics on hospital and emergency department utilization rates for
our sample. The first three columns display hospitalization rates (per 10,000 individuals) for 15
year-olds in 1999, the first year for which we have data. In 1999, there were approximately 260
hospitalizations (not including hospital visits related to pregnancy and delivery) per 10,000
population for all races. Hospitalization rates at this age were higher for blacks, who experienced
approximately 323 hospitalizations per 10,000 individuals, and lower for non-blacks, who
experienced approximately 253 hospitalizations per 10,000 individuals. About 53 percent of
these hospitalizations were for chronic illnesses overall; for blacks, chronic illnesses represented
about 60 percent of total hospitalizations. For 15-year-olds, the most common of these chronic
illnesses are mental disorders, followed by asthma and diabetes.
The next three columns display hospitalization rates for 25 year-olds in 2009. Hospitalization
rates are more common for this age group: among all races, there were 326 hospital visits per
10,000 population; among blacks, there were 517 visits per 10,000 population; among nonblacks, there were 304 visits per 10,000 population. We observe a striking difference in hospital
utilization rates across race groups, particularly for chronic illnesses: blacks at age 25 have a
chronic illness hospitalization rate more than twice that of non-blacks. About 57 percent of
hospitalizations of black patients were for chronic conditions and about 45 percent of
hospitalizations of non-black patients were for chronic conditions. The most common chronic
condition for this age group is also mental disorders. The second most common is diabetes and
the third most common is asthma.
Emergency department visits are more common than hospitalizations and tend to treat less severe
conditions. ED use is described in columns 7 through 9. On average, there are 3,152 emergency
department visits per 10,000 individuals in 2009, almost ten times the hospitalization rate.
Among blacks, this rate is 5,715 per 10,000 individuals; among non-blacks, it is 2,891 per
10,000 individuals. ED visits tend to be for acute conditions; only 12 percent of ED visits are for
chronic illnesses, relative to 47 percent of hospitalizations for this age group. We again observe
dramatic differences across races related to chronic illnesses, as blacks experience more than
twice the rate of ED utilization for chronic illnesses as non-blacks.
These descriptive statistics highlight the importance of using a large sample to investigate
utilization in these age groups. With a per capita hospitalization rate of under 0.026 in 1999, and
	  

13

0.033 in 2009, it would be very difficult to detect changes in utilization rates among the relevant
cohorts using, for example, survey data. By employing large administrative datasets, we are able
to credibly investigate changes in hospitalizations and ED visits even though overall usage rates
in these age groups are low.

V. Empirical Strategy
To estimate the impact of childhood Medicaid eligibility on later life hospitalization and ED
visits, we use a regression discontinuity approach and compare outcomes for cohorts born just
before and after the September 30, 1983 birthdate cutoff. We rely on both a parametric
specification (e.g., polynomial) and local linear regression to estimate the discontinuity in
outcomes at the birth date cutoff point. These complementary methods offer tradeoffs in terms of
bias and variance and are presented together to assess the stability of results (Lee and Lemieux
2010). We use the log number of hospitalizations or ED visits as the dependent variable, which
assumes that population trends smoothly across birth month cohorts.16 Estimates of the RD are
interpreted as the proportionate change in the rate of hospitalizations or ED visits.

We first estimate a second-order polynomial regression model that uses observations from
monthly cohorts born within a specified window of the cutoff date. Each cohort born between
October 1979 and September 1987 is denoted using the integer values 𝑐 ∈ [−48, 47] , where
c=0 for the first cohort born after the cutoff (October 1983). We present results for our main
specification that relies on a 4-year (c ∈ [-48, 47]) window of birth month cohorts on either side
of the cutoff. Additionally, we show alternative analyses that use 3-year (c ∈ [−36,
35]) and 2-year (c ∈ [−24, 23]) windows of birth month cohorts.
The regression specification is given by

Wherry and Meyer (forthcoming) find evidence of a decrease in mortality at ages 15-18
resulting from the Medicaid expansions for black children born after the cutoff. Without
adjusting for the corresponding change in the underlying population count at age 25, this biases
us against detecting a decrease in later life hospitalizations or ED visits.

where yc represents the number of hospitalizations or ED visits for a given birth cohort and Dc is
an indicator for cohorts born after September 30, 1983 (𝑐 ≥ 0). We include a quadratic function
in birth month cohort c that is allowed to differ on both sides of the cutoff point by including an
interaction term for those cohorts born after the cutoff. In addition, we include calendar month
dummies Mc to control for variation in outcomes related to the link between timing of birth and
family characteristics (Buckles and Hungerman 2012). The inclusion of these dummies will also
net out the effects of policies that may differentially affect cohorts born in certain months (for
example, school entry dates). For each outcome, we present visual evidence by plotting in twomonth bins the residuals for birth month cohorts in the 4-year observation window from a
regression on the set of calendar month dummies. The fitted line is the result of regressing the
residuals on a quadratic function in birth month cohort interacted with the post-September 30,
1983 dummy.

We also use local linear regression to estimate the discontinuity in outcomes at the cutoff point.
The estimation is conducted with a triangular kernel and we present results that employ two
different optimal bandwidth selector procedures proposed by Imbens and Kalyanaraman (2012)
and Calonico, Cattaneo, and Titiunik (2014).

These methods estimate the effect of the eligibility expansions averaged across the full sample of
children at the cutoff. This is an example of a “fuzzy” RD design because factors other than date
of birth determine eligibility for and take-up of public health insurance. Although we do not have
information in our data on whether individuals were eligible for or took up public health
insurance, we are able to examine outcomes for certain subsamples that were more likely to be
affected by the change in Medicaid policy. In particular, we examine outcomes separately by
race and income in accord with the variation in treatment documented previously.
We also investigate differences in outcomes by state of residence. As described earlier, states’
socioeconomic characteristics and eligibility criteria in place prior to the expansions led to
variation in the size of the gain in Medicaid eligibility for children born after September 30,

	  

15

1983. We exploit this variation and estimate changes in outcomes associated with the relative
size of the discontinuity in childhood eligibility in each state.
We estimate the following specification for the 4-year window of observations around the cutoff:
log 𝑦!" = 𝛼 + 𝛽! 𝐷! ∙ 𝐺! +𝛽! 𝐷! + 𝛾!! 𝑐! + 𝛾!! 𝑐 ! ! + 𝛾!! 𝐷! ∙ 𝑐! + 𝛾!! 𝐷! ∙ 𝑐 ! ! + 𝛿! + 𝛿! 𝑀! + 𝜀!"

(2)
where we regress the log of a given state-cohort outcome ycs on an indicator for cohorts born
after the cutoff Dc and its interaction with a measure of the size of the discontinuity in each state
in eligibility-years Gs. In addition to including state and calendar month of birth fixed effects, we
also include second order polynomial trends in birth month cohort that differ on either side of the
discontinuity. In more flexible models, we allow these trends to vary by state. This regression is
weighted using the state population of individuals in the range of ages used in these regressions,
i.e., ages 22 to 30. These estimates are from the 2007 to 2011 5-year estimates of the American
Community Survey. Due to the small number of states in our sample, we use the studentized
wild bootstrap method with 999 bootstrap repetitions clustered by state for hypothesis testing and
constructing confidence intervals. This method has been shown to perform well even when there
are relatively few clusters (see Cameron, Gelbach and Miller 2008).
Some state by birth month cohort cells have zero hospitalizations for blacks; if this is the case for
any birth month cohort in a state, we drop that entire state when conducting the analysis for the
black and non-black subsamples. This leads us to drop two states in our analysis.

VI. Results
Figure 4 presents the profile of log hospitalizations by birth month cohort in 1999, when the
cohorts born just on either side of the cutoff are approximately 15 years of age. As seen in the
figure, hospitalizations are correlated with age (i.e. birth month), which is the running variable in
the RD estimation. As noted earlier, we address the possibility of different trends on either side
of the September 30, 1983 cutoff by allowing the polynomial in birth month cohort to have
different coefficients on either side of the cutoff. Visually, the figure reveals little evidence of a
discontinuity in outcomes at the September 30, 1983 threshold. Estimates of the discontinuity

	  

16

from the regression analysis reported in Table 5 support this conclusion. Overall, we do not find
a consistent pattern suggesting changes in hospital utilization in this year. We observe
statistically significant decreases in non-pregnancy hospitalizations and non-chronic illness
hospitalizations for all races, but only in the local linear regression models. We find some
evidence of significant increases in non-pregnancy hospitalizations and chronic-illness
hospitalizations for non-black patients, but the coefficient estimates are only significant in some
of the specifications that use a polynomial in birth cohort. We also note that the statistical power
of the analysis is modest due to both the smaller number of states available for this year and the
low rates of utilization for this age group.
Figure 5 displays hospitalization outcomes in 2009 when cohorts born around the cutoff were
approximately 25 years old. Table 6 presents the corresponding discontinuity estimates. Among
all races, we find no evidence of a significant reduction in hospitalizations for those born after
the birthdate cutoff. However, for blacks, there is a notable drop in hospitalizations visible at the
cutoff. The regression analysis indicates a reduction in hospitalizations of between 7 and 15
percent for those cohorts born just after the September 30, 1983 date, depending on the
specification. All estimates are statistically significant with the exception of the estimate under
the global polynomial specification with the largest window of observations, which is significant
at the 10 percent level. Furthermore, there is clear evidence of a significant decline in
hospitalizations related to chronic illness. Our estimates indicate declines in hospitalizations for
chronic illnesses on the order of 11 to 18 percent across specifications. For hospitalizations
related to non-chronic illness, the estimated decline is smaller—3 to 11 percent—and only
significant when using local linear regression methods. We do not find any evidence of a similar
improvement for non-blacks. We find some evidence of an increase in hospitalizations for this
group, but the estimates are not significant in most specifications and are not supported by the
visual evidence presented in Figure 5.
Figure 6 and Table 7 present similar results for emergency department visits. We find a reduction
in rates of ED visits of between 2 and 5 percent among black cohorts born immediately after the
birth date cutoff, although the estimates are not significant across all bandwidth choices. When
we examine ED visits by their relation to chronic illness, we find evidence of a sizeable decline

	  

17

in visits related to chronic illness (of between 10 and 15 percent). For all races and non-blacks,
we find no evidence of a similar reduction in ED visits.
Assuming similar effect sizes and hospitalization rates across other states, our point estimates
imply that, nationally, there were approximately 2,200 to 4,900 fewer inpatient hospitalizations
among black cohorts born during the first year after the cutoff at age 25.17 The change in the
probability of gaining eligibility across the birth date cutoff was about 17 percentage points for
blacks. If we assume that the reduction in hospitalizations observed in 2009 is entirely a result of
the eligibility expansion, the point estimates from our specifications imply that there were
between 2.1 and 4.6 fewer hospitalizations at age 25 for every 100 black children who were
made eligible for (on average) 4.8 additional years of Medicaid eligibility as a result of the
expansions. This reduction for eligible children is large relative to the average rate of
hospitalization among all 25-year-old blacks, representing 41 to 88 percent fewer
hospitalizations relative to that average. However, because the children that were affected by
these expansions were in poor households, and because the poor tend to be in worse health than
the general population, it is likely that their baseline hospitalization rates would be higher than
that of a typical black 25 year old.18 Overall, while the point estimates are somewhat large, they
are plausible. In addition, the 95% confidence intervals on our estimates allow for the possibility
of smaller effect sizes.
We can further scale these estimates by take-up rates to arrive at the effect of Medicaid coverage,
rather than Medicaid eligibility, on hospitalizations later in life. However, because parents tend
to enroll children when they become ill or injured (Marton and Yelowitz 2014), this calculation
would describe the local effect on (most likely) the sickest children with the highest rates of
hospitalization. This may present an overly optimistic view of what Medicaid coverage
expansions can accomplish for the average Medicaid-eligible child. Nonetheless, we perform
such a calculation. Based on the estimates presented in Tables 2 and 3, we estimated take-up

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
17

Using the Census Estimate that in 2009 there were 617,000 blacks age 25, and that the average
hospitalization rate at age 25 for blacks was 517.1 per 10,000 (Table 4). 	  
18
Case, Lubotsky and Paxson (2002) find that children from low-income families have worse
health in childhood, and that the differences between children raised in low- and high-income
families become more pronounced as the children grow older and enter adulthood.	  
	  

18

rates on the order of 29 to 47 percent.19 A take-up rate of 29 percent implies that for every 100
black children who enrolled in Medicaid there were between 7.3 and 15.7 fewer hospitalizations
at age 25. Meanwhile, a take-up rate of 47 percent implies between 4.5 and 9.7 fewer
hospitalizations for every 100 black children who enrolled in Medicaid.
Similarly, our point estimates imply that, nationally, there were approximately 7,100 and 17,600
fewer emergency department visits experienced by blacks born the first year after the cutoff at
age 25. Again assuming this reduction is driven entirely by the eligibility expansion, this
estimate implies that there were between 6.7 and 16.8 fewer emergency department visits at this
age for every 100 black children made eligible as a result of the expansions. Comparing this to
average ED use in the population of blacks suggests that gaining an average of 4.8 additional
years of Medicaid eligibility in childhood lowers emergency department use by 12 to 29 percent
at age 25. However, as we noted previously, baseline ED use among adults who grew up in lowincome families is likely higher than average ED use in the population. When scaled by our
estimate of 29 percent take-up, this implies that there were between 23.2 and 58.0 fewer ED
visits at age 25 for every 100 black children newly enrolled in Medicaid. Using our higher takeup estimate (47 percent) implies between 14.3 and 35.8 fewer ED visits for every 100 new
enrollees.
Low-income Zipcodes
Next we examine changes in hospitalizations and ED visits in 2009 for patients from low-income
zipcodes (Tables 8-9 and Figures 7-8).20 If children who grew up in poor families still reside in
low-income zipcodes, we might expect to see larger changes for patients from these zipcodes.
We find a reduction in total hospitalizations of between 10 and 23 percent among black cohorts
in low-income zipcodes born just after September 30, 1983, and the coefficient estimate is
statistically significant at the .05 level in four of our five specifications. This range of estimates
indicates that the effects are larger in low-income zipcodes than in the full sample of zipcodes (7
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
19

	  These takeup rates as well as others in the literature should be interpreted cautiously since they
are subject to substantial biases due to measurement error both in eligibility and reported
coverage (Klerman et al. 2009). Note that measurement error in a binary dependent variable
generally leads to bias (Hausman, Abrevaya and Scott-Morton 1998). 	  
20
	  The HCUP hospitalization data includes information on median income of the patient’s zip
code in 2009 only, so we are unable to conduct this analysis with the 1999 data.	  
	  

19

to 15 percent). In addition, the decline appears to be concentrated among hospitalizations related
to chronic illness, where we see reductions of between 15 and 28 percent that are statistically
significant in all specifications. There is no significant reduction in hospitalizations for nonchronic illnesses.
Similarly, we find evidence of a larger decrease in ED visits for blacks in low-income zipcodes
than for all blacks with estimates ranging between 4 and 6 percent, although the estimates are
only significant in certain specifications. There is some evidence for reductions in chronic and
non-chronic illness related ED visits as well, but the estimates are not consistently significant.
Finally, as in our previous analysis, we find no evidence of a significant reduction in
hospitalizations or ED visits from persons from low-income zipcodes of all races or non-blacks.
In both the full sample and the low-income sample we estimate different effects across race
groups, estimating large reductions for blacks, but not for non-blacks. There are two likely
explanations for this heterogeneity. First, as described in Section III, the policy change had a
larger impact for blacks, who were more than twice as likely to experience a gain in eligibility.
We also find less evidence of take-up of Medicaid coverage among non-blacks as compared to
blacks. Second, as noted in Section IV, blacks experience dramatically higher hospitalization
rates on average than non-blacks. This difference is particularly pronounced for hospitalizations
related to chronic illnesses: for these types of hospitalizations, the utilization rate is more than
double among blacks than among non-blacks (as compared to acute conditions, for which the
utilization rate is only 34 percent higher among blacks). As a result, it may be the case that the
intervention itself was more effective for this race group because this group has a much higher
baseline risk.
Heterogeneity by State
In this section, we use the substantial differences across states in the average size of the
discontinuity in eligibility-years for cohorts born at the cutoff (see Table 2) as an additional
source of variation in our analysis. If our observed changes in utilization across the threshold are
indeed driven by differences in Medicaid eligibility in childhood, we might expect the
discontinuity in utilization at the cutoff birth date to be larger in states where the change in
eligibility across that threshold is greater.
	  

20

To explore this heterogeneity, we estimate the model described by equation (2). The variable Gs
is the estimated size of the discontinuity in eligibility that occurs at the cutoff in state s (as
reported in Table 2). Our coefficient of interest is the interaction between Dc and the size of the
discontinuity in the number of Medicaid-eligible years in state s, which captures the marginal
effect of an additional year of eligibility on the outcome variable. We estimate two versions of
this model: a “flexible” version that allows trends by birth month cohort to vary by state and a
“restrictive” version that requires the time patterns to be the same in all states. The flexible
version may be preferred because it allows birth month trends to be different across states;
however, because our number of observations is small relative to the number of parameters we
estimate, the less demanding restrictive version is also appealing. We therefore have elected to
report both versions, but note that there is little qualitative difference in results.
Table 10 presents the results using hospitalizations in 2009. We find evidence suggesting that the
decrease in hospitalizations is most pronounced for individuals living in states with large
discontinuities.21 For patients of all races, we find that a one year increase in the size of the
discontinuity at the birth date cutoff reduces hospitalizations by between 6 and 8 percent,
although the effect is only significant at the 10 percent level in the flexible model. We also find
some evidence of reductions in chronic and non-chronic illness hospitalizations, although in the
flexible model the effects are not statistically significant.
The second panel presents results for black patients. Although we observe negative point
estimates associated with increases in the discontinuity size across states, none of the effects are
statistically significant, and in this case, we have limited statistical power to detect modest effect
sizes. The third panel presents results for non-black patients. Here, we find that a one-year
increase in the size of the discontinuity is associated with significant reductions in overall
hospitalizations and hospitalizations related to both chronic and non-chronic illnesses. Our
results suggest that a one year increase in eligibility is associated with a reduction in nonpregnancy hospitalizations of 8 or 10 percent, depending on the specification. We also find a

The results using hospitalizations in 1999, when birth cohorts born around the cutoff birth date
are 15 years old, are reported in Appendix Table 3. As in our original specification, we do not
find systematic evidence that those born immediately after the cutoff had fewer hospitalizations
at this age.

reduction in chronic illness hospitalizations of 7 or 8 percent and a reduction in non-chronic
illness hospitalizations of 10 and 12 percent.
In Table 11 we perform a similar analysis using emergency department data. In the top panel we
report the results for all races. We find evidence of a decline in ED visits for cohorts born after
the cutoff although the estimate is only statistically significant under the flexible model. The
coefficient indicates that an additional year of Medicaid eligibility is associated with an 8 percent
reduction in ED use at age 25. We also find significant declines for chronic and non-chronic
illnesses under the flexible model, where an additional year of Medicaid eligibility is associated
with 11 and 7 percent reductions respectively.
Conducting this analysis for blacks, we again find negative point estimates for all model
specifications and visit types although none are statistically significant. Among non-blacks, we
see that a one year increase in Medicaid eligibility is associated with an 8 percent reduction in
overall ED visits, a 15 percent reduction in chronic illness ED visits, and a 7 percent reduction in
non-chronic illness ED visits, although as with the results for all races, these effects are only
statistically significant in the flexible model.
Because we uncover significant effects for non-blacks and not for blacks in the state-level
models, at first glance these results might appear contradictory to those reported in the previous
section. However, this is not necessarily the case. First, because our measures of the
discontinuity at the state level are race-specific, they account for the fact that the effect of the
policy was much smaller on non-blacks than on blacks. The results in the previous section
looked at the overall change by race without scaling for the differences in the amount of
exposure to treatment. Second, although the effects are not significant, we do observe negative
point estimates for all models and visit types among the black sample, suggesting that the effects
are indeed larger in states with a larger discontinuity. However, because many states in our
sample have small black populations, it is the case that both the estimate of the size of the
discontinuity in each state and the birth-month level utilization rates are imprecisely measured.
We attempt to account for this by weighting the regressions by the state population; however, we
are still forced to drop a large number of birth month observations for blacks due to zeros in the
dependent variable.

VII. Sensitivity Analyses
We conduct several sensitivity analyses. First, we estimate the effect of discontinuous Medicaid
eligibility on two types of hospitalizations that are unlikely to be affected by medical
intervention in childhood: hospitalizations for appendicitis and injury. Second, we use birth
month cohorts born between January 1965 and September 1983 to estimate placebo effects at
cutoffs where the cohorts did not actually experience a discontinuity in Medicaid eligibility.
Third, we examine the sensitivity of the estimates to the exclusion of California, which both
comprises a large proportion of our sample and has the smallest discontinuity size of any state in
our sample. Finally, we explore the sensitivity of our results to the inclusion of cohort-specific
characteristics including measures of health at birth.
Hospitalizations for Acute Conditions
We first present estimates using hospitalizations for appendicitis and injuries for all patients and
the low-income sample in 2009 by race group. Both appendicitis and injury are acute conditions
that are likely not sensitive to medical care received in the past. For that reason, we believe it is
unlikely that coverage in childhood could plausibly influence hospitalizations for these
conditions. If we find effects on these types of hospitalizations, it may indicate that the
assumptions of our RD model are incorrect.
The results of these analyses are reported in Appendix Table 2. The first panel shows the results
for hospitalizations in 2009 for patients from all zip codes stratified by race. The second panel
shows similar results for patients from low-income zip codes. In both panels, we find point
estimates that are close to zero, none of which are statistically significant for any race group.
Although the confidence intervals are large, we note that the point estimates are smaller in
magnitude than those reported for all hospitalizations and chronic illness related hospitalizations
and that the direction of the estimates is not consistent, with roughly half of the specifications
reporting small, statistically insignificant positive effects and half reporting similarly sized
negative effects. Overall, this suggests there was little impact of the policy on these types of
visits. This result is consistent with our expectation that these types of visits should not be
affected by access to medical care in childhood.
	  

23

Placebo Estimates at Non-Discontinuity Points
We conduct a second type of placebo test using data on cohorts born prior to the actual eligibility
cutoff. We place an artificial “cut off” date in the center of each four year window (eight year
period) beginning with cohorts born in January 1965. We then estimate models that mimic our
main “global” polynomial specification that uses a 4 year window and the “local” specification
that chooses an optimal bandwidth using the Imbens and Kalyanaraman (2012) procedure. Our
final placebo “cut off” is placed at September 1979, so that the last month used in the estimation
of these placebo effects is September 1983, immediately before the actual change in Medicaid
eligibility occurs. This results in 129 “placebo estimates” estimated at birth dates where no
policy discontinuity existed. We perform this analysis using the sample of black patients and
outcomes where we previously uncovered significant results using traditional inference.
Using these placebo estimates, we construct histograms, which we report in Figures 4 and 5. The
effect estimated at the “true” cutoff is shown on the figure as a black vertical line. The two
graphs in Appendix Figure 4 show the distribution of placebo statistics for the global polynomial
and local linear specifications of the total number of hospitalizations in 2009 for black patients.
We find that the true estimate among black patients is large relative to the placebo estimates.
Using the global polynomial specification, the true effect exceeds all but 14 (10 percent) of the
placebo estimates in absolute value. Using the local linear specification, the true effect exceeds
all but 1 (less than 1 percent) of the placebo estimates.
The next two graphs in Appendix Figure 4 show the distribution of placebo estimates for chronic
illness related hospitalizations. The effect for blacks estimated at the September 30, 1983 cutoff
is larger in absolute value than all but 7 (5.4 percent) of the placebo estimates in the global
model and all but 4 (3.1 percent) of the placebo estimates in the local model.
The next four panels of Appendix Figure 4 report the distribution of placebo estimates for
hospitalizations of low-income black patients in 2009. Using data on all non-pregnancy
hospitalizations, we find that the true effect is larger in magnitude than all but 5 (3.8 percent) of
placebo estimates in the global model and it exceeds all placebo effects in the local model. When
we conduct this analysis for chronic illness related hospitalizations, we find that the true effect
exceeds all placebo estimates in both the local and the global model.

	  

24

In Appendix Figure 5 we present similar distributions for placebo estimates using emergency
department data. Here, our results conform less to the original inference conducted in Tables 7
and 9. We find that the true effect exceeds only about 64 and 45 percent of the placebo effects in
magnitude for total hospitalizations in the global and local models, respectively. We find
somewhat more promising results for chronic illness related ED visits: using the global model,
we find that the true effect exceeds all but 14 percent of the placebo effects and, using the local
model, we find that the true effect exceeds all but 6 percent of placebo effects. In the low income
sample, we find that the true effect exceeds all but 22 percent of the placebo effects for all nonpregnancy hospitalizations in the global model and a little over half of the placebo effects in the
local model.
Overall, the placebo simulations conducted in this section strongly suggest that the estimated
effects of the Medicaid policy that we observe on hospitalizations among black cohorts is larger
than estimates that we might observe due to chance. In addition, the simulations provide
particularly convincing evidence supporting our results for the low-income subsample of blacks.
The placebo tests are less convincing when applied to the emergency department results;
although the effect of Medicaid on chronic illness emergency department visits estimated at the
true discontinuity exceeds the majority of placebo estimates, many of placebo estimates are
larger in absolute value than the “true” effect in other models.
Exclusion of California
Throughout our analysis, we include all available states. However, as illustrated in Table 2, some
states have relatively small discontinuities in eligibility at the birth date cutoff. In particular,
California has the smallest discontinuity in eligibility (about 0.05 years) and represents a large
share of the total population in our state sample (about 25 percent). We therefore explore how
sensitive our results are to excluding California from our analysis by re-estimating Tables 5
through 9 without California.
We present the results in Appendix Tables 4-8. As expected, when California is excluded, our
results tend to be larger and are more likely to be statistically significant. We find that the reform
reduces hospitalizations among black patients in 2009 by between 9.5 and 17.0 percent
(compared to between 7.1 and 15.4 percent in our original analysis) and all effects are

	  

25

statistically significant; it reduced chronic illness hospitalizations by between 13.2 and 20.1
percent (compared to 10.6 and 18.4 percent). In the low income sample, when California is
excluded, we also detect statistically significant reductions in ED visits for all races. These
results suggest that ED visits were between 3 and 5 percent lower among patients of all races for
those born after the birth date cutoff.
Inclusion of Cohort-Specific Characteristics
Finally, we examine the sensitivity of our estimates to the inclusion of several cohort-specific
characteristics drawn from the National Vital Statistics System Birth Data files for 1979 to 1987.
We include controls for the following birth outcomes: the fraction of mothers with at least a high
school education, fraction of mothers married, and fraction of mothers receiving any prenatal
care; the incidence of low birth weight and very low birth weight births; and the number of
births. Reported in Appendix Tables 9-11, the results are robust to the inclusion of these
covariates.

VIII. Was the Upfront Cost of the Medicaid Expansions Offset by Lower Utilization Later
in Life?
The results presented in this paper provide evidence that expanding Medicaid coverage to
children lowers future health care costs by improving health and reducing later life hospital and
emergency department use among those who gain eligibility. In this section, we provide “back of
the envelope” calculations on the magnitude of these cost savings relative to the upfront cost of
expanding Medicaid.
To conduct this analysis, we estimate models similar to those reported in Tables 6 and 7 but
using log of total costs by birth month cohort as the dependent variable. We calculate total
hospital costs by applying HCUP “cost to charge” ratios to the discharge-level data on total
charges.22 These “cost to charge” ratios are designed to estimate the resource cost of a hospital
visit using data from accounting reports collected by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
22

We do not have total charges for California or Texas, so we impute these values at the three
digit diagnosis code level using the charge data from the relevant age group in other states.
	  

26

Services. We then sum total costs at the birth month cohort level and estimate models as
described in equation (2).
The results of this analysis are reported in Table 12 and Figure 9. We find that hospital costs
among black cohorts fell by between 8 and 14 percent for those born immediately after the birth
date cutoff. These reductions in costs are highly significant in the local linear models, but only
marginally significant or not significant in the global polynomial specifications. Using the point
estimates, and assuming that the results apply to all states, and using the total hospitalization
costs of those born the year before the cutoff as a baseline, our analysis implies that the Medicaid
expansions reduced total hospital costs at age 25 by between $18.5 and $32.4 million for black
cohorts born the year following the cutoff.23
The second panel of Table 11 reports the results for ED costs. We find that the Medicaid
expansions reduced ED costs by 5 to 8 percent in 2009. Performing similar calculations as
described above, we estimate that the expansions reduced emergency department costs at age 25
among black cohorts born during the following year of between $6.7 and $10.6 million.24
To arrive at an estimate of the original cost of expanding Medicaid, we rely on the average
spending per child enrolled in Medicaid in 1991, which was $902 per child (in 1991 dollars)
(Congressional Research Services (1993)).25 Multiplying this amount by the average gain in
years enrolled in Medicaid using information from Tables 1 and 3 and assuming a 3 percent
discount rate, this implies that the total cost of the eligibility expansions for all children born
during the year following the September 30, 1983 cutoff was approximately $910 million dollars

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
23

The total cost of 2009 hospitalizations for blacks born between October 1982 and September
1983 in our sample states was $88 million. With approximately 38 percent of all 25-year-old
blacks in the U.S. represented in our sample, we estimate total costs for these cohorts at the
national level at $231.6 million.
24
Similar to the last calculation, we estimate total emergency department costs for the black
cohorts born the year before the cutoff at the national level at $133.3 million based on the total
costs of $28 million observed for these cohorts in our sample states. States in the emergency
department sample represent about 21 percent of all 25-year-old blacks in the U.S.
25
Because most (78 percent) of our variation in the discontinuity is a result of the Omnibus
Reconciliation Act of 1990 that was implemented in 1991, we use 1991 as our base year in these
calculations.
	  

27

in 2009.26 The cost offsets from childhood Medicaid expansions, totaling between $25.2 and
$43 million at age 25, therefore represent between 3 and 5 percent of the total cost of the
expansions. If the reduction in utilization we observe at age 25 persists for several years, the cost
offsets associated with these expansions will be even larger.
Finally, we examine changes in total costs by the source of payment for visits in order to
evaluate the incidence of these cost savings. These results are reported in Appendix Table 12.
We find that total costs associated with publicly-insured hospital visits fell significantly for black
patients, by about 14 percent, although the effects are not statistically significant for all
bandwidths. We do not find significant changes in total costs associated with visits for other
payers. Total hospital costs excluding pregnancies to public payers for 25 year-old black patients
in 2009 were about $125 million. Our results therefore imply that costs to public payers were
about $17.5 million lower for individuals born just after the cutoff. Cost savings accruing to the
government therefore represent between 54 and 95 percent of the $18.5 to $32.4 million in
estimated hospitalization-related cost savings and between 41 and 69 percent of the $25.2 to $43
million in estimated total cost savings.
Among emergency department visits, we find significant reductions of between 7 and 11 percent
in costs associated with visits paid for by private insurance. Performing a similar calculation as
above, this would imply that ED costs to private insurers were between $3 and $4.8 million
lower for individuals born immediately after the cutoff birth date. Our results also indicate that
there may have been meaningful reductions in costs for self-pay ED visits, although these effects
are not statistically significant in all models. In addition, we find consistently negative, although
not statistically significant, effects on costs to public payers.
These calculations indicate that the long-run cost savings from the Medicaid expansions may be
quite substantial. Considering the other research on the long run effects of these expansions on
other outcomes, the true cost offsets of the Medicaid expansions might be larger still.
Specifically, our estimates do not incorporate other benefits to government (such as higher
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
26

The Census estimate for the total number of 25-year-olds in 2009 is 4,264,000. We multiply
this estimate by the 0.48 year average gain in childhood eligibility, a take-up rate of 29 percent
(which is the median of the takeup rates calculated based on the estimates in Tables 1 and 3), the
$902 cost per year of enrollment per child in 1991, and a 3% discount rate to arrive at our
estimate.

IX.

Conclusion

Policies that expand public health insurance coverage tend to increase utilization and, thus, the
total resources devoted to health care spending in the economy in the short term. However, there
may be longer-term costs savings that do not materialize until later in life because of improved
health. While these long-term cost savings are often cited in policy discussions and debates, very
little credible evidence exists on the magnitude of these effects, or even if they are present at all.
This is a crucial gap in our understanding of the role of public health insurance coverage as these
cost offsets potentially represent a substantial, but previously unaccounted-for, benefit of such
programs. There is also limited evidence on the technology of how investments in health in the
pre-teen and early teen years affect health among adults. Understanding this process of health
production is important in designing policies to ameliorate disadvantage.
In this paper, we provide evidence of such effects by exploiting a discontinuity in the number of
years a child is eligible for Medicaid based on his or her date of birth. Because several of the
early Medicaid coverage expansions to poor children applied only to children born after
September 30, 1983, children born immediately after this cutoff received more years of Medicaid
eligibility throughout childhood. Among blacks, who were most likely to be affected by these
expansions, we find that those born immediately after the cutoff had a significant reduction in
hospitalizations and emergency department visits at age 25 compared to those born immediately
before the cutoff. The effect is particularly pronounced for chronic illness related hospitalizations
and ED visits, among patients in low-income neighborhoods, and in states where the size of the
eligibility discontinuity was large. A back of the envelope calculation based on our point
estimates suggests that these reductions in utilization for the cohorts born one year after the birth
date cutoff offset between 3 and 5 percent of the total cost of the expansions we study, and that a
large fraction of this cost savings accrued to the government in the form of lower public
insurance payments. Our evidence also suggests that health interventions in the pre-teen and
early teen years for disadvantaged populations can provide long-term health benefits.
