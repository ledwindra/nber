Monetary Policy and Short-Term Interest Rates:
An Efficient Markets-Rational Expectations Approach

ABSTRACT

The impact of a money stock increase on nominal short—term interest rates
has been a hotly debated issue in the monetary economics literature. The most
commonly held view——also a feature of most structural macro models——has an
increase in the money stock leading, at least in the short-run, to a decline

in short interest rates. Monetarists dispute this view because they believe
that it ignores the dynamic effects of a money stock increase.
This paper is an application of efficient markets—rational expectations
theory to analyze empirically the relationship of money supply growth and short-

term interest rates- This approach has the advantage over earlier research
on this subject in that it imposes a theoretical structure that allows easier
interpretation of the empirical results as well as more powerful statistical

tests. In the interest of ascertaining the robustness of the results, many
different empirical tests are carried out in this paper, and they uniformly
do not support the proposition that increases in the money supply are correlated with declines in short rates.

INTRODUCTION
The relationship between money supply growth and nominal interest

rates is a hotly debated issue in the literaturej One view, associated
with "Keynesian" structural macro models, has an increase in the money
stock leading, at least in the short and medium runs, to a decline in

interest rates.2 An alternative view, associated with Milton Friedman
(1968, 1969), indicates that interest rates might rise in response to an
increase in money growth because the increase in money growth might lead
to a rise in inflationary expectations and hence a rise in interest rates
through a Fisher (1930) effect.

Previous empirical work on this issue has ignored constraints implied
by the view that financial markets display rational expectations and are

thus "efficient." Financial market efficiency should not be ignored because
evidence supporting it is quite strong and recent work indicates that a
failure to impose financial market efficiency on macroeconometric models

can lead to highly misleading results.3 In addition, a failure to impose the
efficient markets (or, equivalently, rational expectations) constraints leads
to a larger number of parameters to be estimated in this empirical work, and
this leads to statistical tests with low power.4

1Unless otherwise noted, whenever the phrase "interest rates" is used
in this paper, it refers to nominal interest rates.
2For example, see Modigliani (1975)
3See Fama (1970) and Mishkin (1978)

4A more extensive discussion of the previous empirical work on this
topic and references to this work can be found in Mishkin (1981).

The theory of efficient capital markets and rational expectations suggests an alternative approach for analyzing the relationship of money stock

increases and interest rate movements. A previous paper (Mishkin (1981a)
developed an efficient markets model of long interest rate determination,

and then estimated this model using postwar quarterly data. This approach
had the advantage of imposing a theoretical structure on the problem
that allowed easier interpretation of the empirical results as well as more

powerful statistical tests of the proposition that increases in the money
stock are correlated with declines in long rates. In addition, a Keynesian,
liquidity preference view of interest rate determination was embedded in the

efficient markets mc del and tested
This paper is a sequel to the earlier paper in that it conducts a
similar analysis for short—term interest rates. The next section develops
a rational expectations (or, equivalently, efficient markets) model for
analyzing movements in short rates, and this model is estimated in the sub-

sequent section. This paper then concludes with an interpretation of these
results.

II
THE MODEL

The theory of rational expectations (or, equivalently, efficient markets

theory) indicates that interest rates in a bond market should reflect

all available information. To be more precise, it

Equation (2) above states that the forecast error for short rates

).

The rational erpectations model (3) stresses that an unanticipated change5
in the short rate will occur only when unanticipated information hits the
market. This distinction between the possible effects from unanticipated
versus anticipated movements in variables is indeed an important feature

of recent eirical work (for exaanple,Barro (1977, 1978)).
In order to make the rational expectations model above empirically

testable we must have a model of market equilibrium. Here we assume, as
in Fama (l976b), that the one—period—ahead forward rate equals the one—
period—ahead expected short rate plus a risk (liquidity) premium which

varies with the uncertainty in short rate movements. I.e.:

Although this type of situation fre-

market equilibrium is thus an important factor that needs to be discussed
further -when the results of the (6) model are analyzed.

The research question posed in the Introduction suggests that the relationship of money growth and unanticipated changes in the short rate in

a rational expectations model is of particular interest.10 Substituting money growth for

provides no information on the exogeneity of the money supply process, the

providing information on the correlations of unanticipated money growth and

the unanticipated change in short rates. Interpretation of these correlations is then deferred to the concluding remarks toward the end of the paper.

also to the growth rate of real income and inflation. Adding this information

Since misleading results can be obtained from efficient markets models

using averaged data, the data for bond returns are derived from security
prices at particular points in time. In keeping with this, an attempt has
been made to derive the other variables used here with data as close to

being end of quarter as possible. For this reason, Industrial Production
is used as a prov for real income in estimating equation ( 8

rather

than

a more broadly based National Income Accounts measure. Similarly, the CPI
has been used to calculate the inflation variable rather than the GNP deflator.

THE ESTIMATION THOD
In order to estimate the efficient markets models of equations (7) and

(s ), measures of anticipated money growth, income growth and inflation must
be developed. Here, anticipations of variables in the information set X

because theory is less

of predictive content.20 One interesting feature of the multivariate

money growth equations is that, in contrast with Barro's (1977) work, no
fiscal policy or unemployment variables were found to be statistically

significant at the five percent level.

values

as the average of the absolute

of the changes in the spot rate during the year before t and during

the year following t.

Because

to be calculated from information not available at t—l does

pose some conceptual difficulties, An alternative, though similar, measure

the spot rate, i.e., r_F was regressed on measures of o, calculated as
the average absolute change of the bill rate over a number of previous

quarters, where the number of quarters was varied, The best fit was obtained with

As in Fama (1976b), increased uncertainty in short rate movements does lead
to an increased risk premium and this effect is statistically significant at

the 1% level. In addition, the

measure used here outperforms the Fama

measure that is constructed from information 'unavailable at t—l. The above
measure of

is used in the empirical tests that follow. However, its

specification is not a critical issue to the outcomes: use of a Fama measure
of

or the exclusion of

from the model altogether does not

alter the results appreciably.

One way to proceed in estimating the rational expectations model is to
use a two—step procedure outlined in the recent work of Barro (1911, 1978),
After estimating the time—series models of Tables 1 and 2, the residuals

from these regressions can be used as proxies for the corresponding
unanticipated variables in estimating equations (8) and
whether

only unanticipated changes are related to r÷ —

(11).

Tests of

r could then also

proceed as in Barro (1977).
Although

the empirical results using the above approach are not unrea-

sonable and are similar to those produced here in the text (see the Appendix),

thore are serious econonetric criticisms of this approacb.22 However,
an econometric technique which does not suffer from these criticisms is

outlined below.23
22See Mishkin (1980)

23The technique used here is quite similar in concept to that proposed
although it is somewhat easier to execute and notationally

by Sargent (1979) ,
simpler.

In matrix notation, the rational expectations model can be written as:

The linear time series model for X, whether univariate or multivariate can
also be written as:

(12) X = Zy + U

where
Z = an n x m matrix of lagged variables, where m is the number of
variables,

y = m x Ic matrix of coefficients,

U = n x Ic matrix of white noise error terms.
The optimal linear forecast of X is then

and substituting this into (ii) we have;

The system in (12) and (14) can be stacked into one regression system
with n(k+l) observations, and it can be estimated by non—linear least squares
methods imposing the constraints that the y#

in

(12) and (14) are equal. In

order to obtain more efficient parameter estimates as well as consistent test
statistics, corrections must be made for heteroscedasticity both within and
across equations in this system.25
26

This procedure is superior to the alternative two—step procedure0
More efficient parameter estimates of 8 and ','

will

result because both

(12) and (14) make use of information from each other in the estimation

process. In addition, it generates a simple test of the model which is

to recent tests of "rationality" in the literature that proceed
along the lines of Modigliani and Shiller (1973).21 It is a simple like—
similar

25The following ].terative procedure was used to correct for heterosce—
dasticity in these estimates. In the first stage estimation of the nonlinear system, if Goldfeld—Quandt tests indicated that heteroscedasticity
existed within an equation, the variables in this equation were weighted
using a time trend procedure outlined by Glesjer (1969). Furthermore, the
variables in each equation of the system were appropriately weighted so that
each equation individually had the same sum of squared residuals. After the
first stage estimation, the sum of squared residuals for each equation were
calculated and were then used to weight the variables in each equation so
that the sum of squared residuals were the same in all cases. Then the nonlinear system was estimated all over again. This resulted in a similar sum
of squared resiudals in all equations of the (12) and ( 14) system so that no
further iterations were performed. Some experimentation did indicate that
no appreciable differences in the results occured if some modification of
this iterative procedure was used which left the sum of squared residuals
reasonably equal for all the equations. For further details on this estimation procedure, see Mishkin (l980)

econometric issues in using the joint non—linear procedure.

THE RESULTS
Because there is no strong theoretical reason for estimating the
rational expectations model with one monetary aggregate versus another, un-

anticipated growth rates of both Ml and M2 are used in estimation. The
resulting

estimates and test statistics of this data appear in Table 3,

Panel A of this table contains estimates where only univariate models of
the

form found in Table 1 are used in (12), while Panel B uses the multi—

variate models of the form found in Table 2, The estimates of the y co
efficients

are not presented here because they are similar to those found

in Tables 1 and 2.

The first issue we should look at is whether the non—linear constraints

implied by the model are satisfied. The likelihood ratio tests reported in
Table 14 indicate that they are not. The marginal significance levels in

Table 1 are the probability of obtaining that value of the likelihood ratio
statistic or higher under the null hypothesis that the non—linear constraints

are valid. They indicate that the constraints are rejected at the 5% level
in six out of eight cases, How should we interpret these rejections?

The non—linear constraints are generated by two hypotheses: i) rational

expectations and 2) the model of

market equilibrium in equation (6). A

rejection of these constraints could thus result from the failure of either
hypothesis.

In the situation where use of the appropriate model of market

equilibrium is unimportant in the test results because it contributes so

little variation to the variable of interest, then rejections of the non-

linear constraints indicate that expectations are not rational. In this
case the rationale for the analysis of this paper would disappear. However,
as discussed in the previous section, the contribution of the model of

market equilibrium to the variation of r
jection of

—

Ft

appears to be large. A re-

the non—linear constraints is then likely to result from a poor

specification of this market equilibrium model.
There

is a substantial body of evidence supporting the rationality of

expectations in bond markets,28 and this leads to a suspicion that it is

the model of market equilibrium that causes the rejections in Table
Fortunately, if this is the source of the rejection, the rational expectations model estimated here is still a valid framework for analyzing the re-

lationship of money growth and short interest rates, With rational expec-

tations, the unanticipated X —

variables

will be uncorrelated with any

past information, among which can be included the determinénts of the
risk premium which is set at t—l. Therefore, if some determinants of this
risk premium have been excluded from the market equilibrium model, with the

resulting rejection of the non—linear constraints, this will not lead to

28

see for example, the survey in Fama (1970) as well as more recent
work such as Mishkin (1978, l981a, b) and Sargent (1979).

2 Os

29

With a suitable transformation of the unconstrained system outlined
in Abel and Mishkin (1980), additional evidence is available on the potential
misspecification of the model of market equilibrium. The unconstrained system
where the y are not equal in (12) and (14) can be rewritten as
(12')

X=Zy+u

(14')

where the y's are constrained to be equal in (12') and (14'). Therefore, the
non—linear constraints tested in this paper are equivalent to ctO in the
above system. It is now easy to see the following point: If the liquidity
premium is related to the variables in Z yet they have been excluded from the
model of the liquidity premium, then this could explain the rejections of
the non—linear constraints found here. To make this conjecture plausible,
we should expect that a model of the liquidity premium which is related to
Z would have reasonable characteristics. For example the Fama—type model of
the liquidity premium in equation (10) does generate plausible values. The
resulting liquidity premiums (at annual rates) have a mean of 57 basis points
and a standard deviation of 30 basis points. They also move smoothly: their
autocorrelations for lags of one through four quarters are respectively .96,
.91, .85, and .78. In the model which leads to the strongest rejection of
the non—linear constraints, model 3.7, we could attribute this rejection to
the fact that a more appropriate specification of the liquidity premium is
(S =
a0 + a1o ÷ Zc*, where Z contains the four lagged values of money growth
(N20) and treasury bill rates (r). This latter specification leads to values
for the liquidity premium that are somewhat more variable and less smooth
than the equation (10) specification, but not appreciably so. The liquidity
premiums from this expanded specification have a mean of 57 basis points,
a standard deviation of 46 basis points and four lagged autocorrelations of
.75, .56, .49 and .29.
Viewing the rejections with the benefit of the system (12') and (14')
also has the advantage that it provides us with potentially interesting information on the liquidity premium. The results in Tables 4 and 6 indicate that
the liquidity premium could be related to money growth and interest rates as
well as the variability measure a. However, they give no indication that the
liquidity premium is in addition related to the other variables in Table 2;
IPG, UN and BOP. The results here thus point out a direction for future
research on the liquidity premium. Following Nelson (1972), I also conducted
more direct experiments on the relation of the liquidity premium to lagged r
and UN with negative results. Experiments with lagged values of r—F also did
not add explanatory power to the model of the liquidity premium.

,

21

inconsistent estizates of the

coefficients030 Since the derivation of a

better model of the risk premium is not necessary for acheiving reliable

estimates of the 8's, this tricq research issue, which is beyond the scope
of this paper, is left as a subject for future research.
The unanticipated 1410 coefficients in Panel A do not support the view

that an unanticipated increase in money growth is correlated with an unan-

ticipated fall in short rates. Not only are both of these coefficients in
model 31 and 3.2 positive rather than negative, but they are also significantly different from zero. The coefficients are not numerically small
either. They indicate that a i% surprise increase in Ml is associated with

a 28 basis point unanticipated increase in the bin rate.31 The Panel B
estimates of the MlG coefficients indicate that the above conclusion on the
relationship of short rates and 141 growth is not altered as a result of us-

ing multivariate versus univariate time—series models to describe expecta-

tions formation. Again both coefficients are positive, although in this
case neither is significantly different from zero0

How different are

the

results found here from those that might be in-

from 'tlceynesian" structural macro—econometric models? The response of

basis point is defined as 1/100 of a percentage point0 I.e., a one
basis point rise in a 5% short rate would denote an increase to 5.0l%
32More details on this simulation experiment are given in Mishkin (1981a).

22

Ml surprise led to an immediate decline of 88 basis points in the bill
rate. This strongly constrasts Tflth the finding here that even the least

positive Ml coefficient is more than five standard deviations away from
this figure.

The similarity between the money growth as well as other coefficients
estimates

in going from Panel A to Panel B is encouraging for it gives us

confidence that the results found here are robust to changes in the models

describing eectations,33 Additional results described in the Appendix

also support this view. Note that the asymptotic t—statistics for the
money growth and inflation coefficients in Panel A tend to be higher than

those in Panel B, thus yielding stronger results0 This lends some support
to the position taken by Feige and Pearce (1976) that forecasts from uni—
variate time—series models may be "economically rational" expectations.

The coefficients on unanticipated M2 growth tell a similar story to the
the Ml growth coefficients0 They also do not support the view that unan-

ticipated

money growth is associated with an unanticipated decline in short

rates. The Panel A results for M2 are not as strong as the Ml results in
supporting a positive correlation between unanticipated money growth and
short rates: both M2 coefficients are positive, but neither is significantly

different from zero. However, in Panel B, one of the positive N2G coefficients is statistically significant while this is not the case for the

M coefficients.
The results on the unanticipated inflation and industrial production

coefficients in Panel A do conform to our priors. In both the Ml and M2

23

As Feige and Pearce (1976) have argued, nnce past information on the
variable to be forecast is used in forecasting, other information might have
little incremental predictive power. The similarity of results in Panel A
and B gives some credibility to this viewpoint and this issue is discussed
more extensively in Mishkin (1980

23

rational expectations models, these coefficients are positive and the inflation coefficients are significantly different from zero at the 1% level0

The Panel B results for inflation are similar to those in Panel A, although

flow only the inflation coefficient in the M2 model is significant. The
results on unanticipated industrial production growth continue to be weak
in Panel B, and here these coefficient now have the "wrong" sign although
they are insignificant.

The rational expectations model does not specify whether the X — Xe

variables

should be described by seasonally adjusted rather than seasonally

unadjusted data. This is an empirical issue that cannot be settled easily
on theoretical grounds because it is not clear whether market participants

concentrate on seasonally adjusted versus unadjusted information0 For this
reason, the (15) and (17) system has also been estimated with seasonally

unadjusted data for the X's over the 1959—76 sample period0 The resulting
estimates and test statistics appear in Tables 5

and 6 and were obtained

with the same techniques as the previous estimates with seasonally adjusted
data.

A comparison of the Tables 3 and L with the Tables 5

and

6 results

indicates that the use of adjusted versus unadjusted data is not a critical

factor in this research0 The likelihood ratio tests of the non—linear constraints in Table 6 have similar marginal significance levels to those in
Table 1, and now five out of eight tests reject these constraints at the 5%

level0 In addition the coefficient estimates are similar to those in Table

,and the Panel A money growth, inflation and industrial production growth

coefficients have larger asymptotic t—statistics than those in Panel B.
There are two important differences in the adjusted versus the unad-

justed results, The unadjusted industrial production coefficients now all

Iv
CONCLUDING R'1ABKS

A wide range of empirical tests exploring the relationship of money
growth

in

and short—term interest rates have been conducted in this paper and

the Appendix. A guiding principle in this research has been the use

of many different empirical tests of the model in order to provide infor-

mation on the robustness of the results. The pursuit of this goal has led
to model estimation where there have been variations along the following

dimensions: 1) the choice of the monetary aggregate, 2) the choice of
the relevant variables to include in the X—vector, 3) the use of seasonally adjusted versus seasonally unadjusted data, )-) the specification of

the time—series models used to describe expectations formation, 5) the
sample period and, 6) the econometric estimation technique.

Even though

some of these model estimates should be more reliable than others for the
reasons discussed earlier, the large number of estimates provide information on the sensitivity and reliability of the results reported here.

The results uniformly support the following conclusion. There is no
empirical support here for the view that unanticipated increases in the

money stock are negatively correlated with unanticipated changes in short

interest rates. This conclusion is similar to that found in a previous
paper, Mishkin (l981a),which conducts a parallel analysis of long—term

interest rate behavior. However there are two aspects of the research
methodolor used here which raise questions about the general validity of
this conclusion.

As has been discussed in the te, the 8 coefficients in the rational

26

expectations models are not invariant to changes in the time—series pro-

cesses of the money growth, income growth and inflation variables. Thus
the conclusions derived from the estimates in this paper only provide information on the relationship of money growth and short rates for this

postwar sample period0 However, realize that many structural macroecono—
metric models which display a negative relationship between money growth
and short rates have been estimated using a sample period which overlaps that

used here. Thus the results reported in this paper are certainly of interest in evaluating these models.

A further difficulty with the research methodolor followed here is
that misspecification of (15), which describes expectations formation,
could

invalidate the results on the relationship between money growth and

short rates. This is possible because misspecification of expectations
formation

could lead to inconsistent and biased

coefficients. However,

the robustness of this paperts results to different specifications of the

time—series models describing expectations provides evidence that this
misspecification problem may not be very severe0

Given the conclusion reached above, how should we interpret it? If
we are willing to accept exogeneity of the money supply process in the

postwar period, the interpretation is clear cut. The evidence here would
then cast doubt on the commonly held view that an unanticipated increase
in the money stock will lead to an unanticipated decline in short—term in-

terest rates. Not only does this suggest that the Federal Reserve cannot
lower short interest rates by increasing the rate of money growth, but it
also requires some modification of the monetary transmission mechanism

27

embodied in structural macro—econometric models. it is plausible that an
unanticipated increase in money growth may not induce unanticipated decline

in short rates because it leads to an iiediate upward revision in expected
inflation. Thus, there is still a potential effect on real interest rates
from unanticipated money growth and the evidence in no way denies that there
are potent effects of money supply increases on aggregate demand,

As was mentioned in Section II of the paper, if unanticipated money
growth is not exogeneous, then the

coefficient estimates are inconsis-

tent and can lead to misleading inference, Particularly disturbing in this
regard is the case where the Federal Reserve smooths interest rates so that
an unanticipated increase in short rates causes a Federal Reserve reaction

of an increase in unanticipated money growth0 The resulting positive cor-

relation of c and MG —
t

t

would then tend to bias the $m coefficient

upward. Thus, even though the estimated B is positive, we cannot rule out
the view in structural macroeconometric models that an exogenous increase
in money growth leads to a decline in short rates, despite the empirical results of this paper.

Note however the nature of money growth endogeneity that is required for

the above statement to be the case, If money growth is endogenous in the
sense that the Federal Reserve modifies money growth within a quarter only
in response to past public information available at the start of the quarter,
this does not result in MGt — MG; being correlated with s. Hence the exis-

tence of Granger (1969) "causality" running from interest rates to money
growth does not imply that the estimates of

will be inconsistent, Tests

of the Sims (1972) variety therefore cannot shed light on the consistency of
the

m

estimates. If we are not to reject the concn view that increases in

28

money growth lead to short interest rate declines, research of a fairly
subtle sort is needed to demonstrate that unanticipated money growth is

positivelt correlated with the contemporaneous error term, s. Hence,
this issue cannot be resolted without further research.

Estimates of the Rational Expectations Models

Using the Two—Step Procedure

The models in Table 3 were also estimated with the Barro (1917) two—

step procefure over the 1959—76 sample period. The resulting coefficient
estimates were not appreciably different from those in Table 3 with the
Mfl coefficients ranging from .20 to ,29, the M2G coefficients from ,09
to .16, the IPG coefficients from 003 to .o6 and the it coefficients from

037 to .67, In order to gain further information on the robustness of the
results, also estimated were rational expectations models which used residuals from eighth order autogressive models of the X—variables, as well
as residuals from multivariate models of the X—variables which excluded

the four lagged values of a variableonly if they were not jointly significant at the ten percent level (rather than the five percent level as in

the text), The results were quite close to those above, and again the
evidence did not support a negative relationshop between unanticipated
money growth and short rates0

Because the Federal Reserve may have changed its reaction function in
the 1970's by paying more attention to the monetary aggregates than it did
previously, it is possible that the results might change substantially if

the 1970's are excluded from the sample period, Two—step estimates of the
Table 3 models over the 1959—69 sample period did not support this con,jec—

tune, The money growth coefficients remained positive, although they did

decline somewhat: the MW coefficients ranged from .11 to .20, while the
M2G coefficients ranged from .03 to ,l2. The IPG coefficients ranged from
_,314 to ,03 and the ii coefficients from '37 to 0530
