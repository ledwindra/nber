    "abstract": "\n\nIn this study we examine the characteristics of industrial demand for energy, which accounts for more than one-fourth of annual energy consumption in the United States. Our research has been focused on four topics: 1. interfuel substitution in two-digit industries; 2. substitution among energy, capital and labor; 3. technical change in energy use; and 4. dynamic structure of energy demand. The results indicate that technical change has occurred through factor augmentation at unequal rates. Statistically significant labor-using and material-saving biases are found. There also appears to have been a small energy-saving bias, but it is not statistically significant.\n\n",
