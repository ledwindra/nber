ABSTRACT
Globalization, in the form of financial flows, which is always advantageous on an aggregative
level, typically creates winners and losers, if left exclusively to market forces. The paper
demonstrates that typical welfare-state redistribution policies, governed by a majority of the
population, spreads the globalization’s gains from trade to all income groups, even those who are
low skilled and have small capital endowments. Therefore, financial globalization of a welfarestate economy generates a Pareto improvement.

Introduction

Financial globalization triggers a race-to-the-bottom tax competition. The consequent erosion in
the tax base, especially on capital, erodes fiscal finance. Reaping the benefits of trade and financial
integration is not automatic, and requires better domestic institutions, essentially improved safety
nets, in advanced countries.
The Economist put it succinctly: “Globalization is a tax problem for three reasons. First, firms
have more freedom over where to locate. This will make it harder for a country to tax a business
much more heavily than its competitors. Second, globalization makes it hard to decide where a
company should pay tax, regardless of where it is based. This gives them [the companies] plenty
of scope to reduce tax bills by shifting operations around or by crafting transfer-pricing. Third,
globalization nibbles away at the edges of taxes on Individuals. It is harder to tax personal income
because skilled professional workers are more mobile than they were two decades ago." (The
Economist, 31st May, 1997).

The paper analyzes the role of the welfare state in spreading the gains from financial globalization
to various income groups under different majority voters, who are sharply different in their wealth
and labor market skills.

The paper is organized as follows. Sections II-IV provides some background discussion on
financial globalization, tax competition, and the size of the welfare state, which serves to motivate
the analysis. Section V develops a stripped down model. Section VI presents the financialglobalization consequences, derived from the model for the welfare state and income inequality.
Section VII elaborates on the role of the welfare state in compensating losers. Section VIII
concludes.

II.

Recent Trends in Financial Globalization

The recent wave of financial globalization in the world economy got started in earnest in the 1990s,
with rising cross-border financial flows among industrial economies and between industrial and
developing economies.2 This was spurred by liberalization of capital controls in many of these

2

Globalization has a new face. China’s emergence as a great economic power has induced a
significant shift in the patterns of world trade, with major effects on income inequality in its trade
partners. Alongside the consumer benefits of expanded trade there are substantial adjustment costs
and distributional consequences for them. Import competition from China, which surged after
2000, was a major force behind both reductions in US manufacturing employment and—through
input-output linkages and other general equilibrium channels—weak overall job growth. However
that import competition from China did not have large aggregative effects in the United States, but
3

countries. It is useful to begin with a standard financial globalization basic benchmark. Complete
international financial integration requires that in the long run (when prices adjust to various
shocks and markets clear) the following arbitrage equation holds.

it had substantially different employment repercussions in different commuting zones. The relative
reductions of employment were regionally concentrated. The US rise in wage inequality that is,
the rise of the college wage premium, is only partly the result of trade globalization; more
important factors are technological progress (biased towards skilled labor) and the decline of the
power of labor unions that were behind strong industrial wages.
China is also a key player in world finance, impacting on all other open capital-market economies.
Indeed, several indicators point to a strengthening of China's role as an investor country in recent
years. By 2017 China is one of the most important FDI source, and destination, among the
economically more advanced economies, such as the US, EU, Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan
and Singapore. Chinese inward FDI as percentage of GDP has been: 13.7 in 2014, 10.9 in 2015,
12.1 in 2016, and 12.6 in 2017. Chinese outward FDI as percentage of GDP has been: 2.4 in
2014, 9.8 in 2015, 12.1 in 2016, and 12.6 in 2017.

world financial markets.
III. Tax Competition: Evidence

Financial globalization triggers tax competition among countries, and the possibility of a “race
to the bottom”. As a result, the tax burden may shift from the highly mobile factors (e.g. capital
and top-skilled labor) to the weakly mobile factors (e.g. low-skill labor). This shift has first-order
implications for both the functional and the size distribution of income. A country that imposes
high tax rates may push mobile factors (especially capital) abroad where the country cannot
effectively tax them, eroding its own tax base and lowering domestic economic activity at the same
time. International tax competition and border tax adjustments of income tax have regained recent
public and scholarly attention since the legislation of the 2017 US Tax Bill, centered on corporate
tax cut and moving from corporate residence based in the direction of corporate source-based, and
curbing profit shifting. It may significantly affect corporate financing and location decisions of

7

both US and European multinational groups.4 In consequence, the enhanced competitive pressure
could result in an erosion of foreign countries’ tax bases and an associated loss in tax revenue
triggering a new wave of international tax competition. 5

The 2017 large tax cut, mainly aimed at corporations and business owners. The real logic behind
corporate tax cuts is that they’re supposed to lead to higher investment. This investment, in turn, would
gradually increase the stock of capital, simultaneously driving down the pretax rate of return on
investment and pushing up wages, thanks to a long -term increase in domestic investment, mainly
financed by inflows of capital from abroad. The pre-reform US tax system was based on worldwide
(residence-based) taxation, under which income was taxed at an equal rate regardless of where profits
were earned. Since repatriation of foreign profits triggered high US taxation, US multinationals had an
incentive to refrain from bringing home their foreign earnings. In the light of substantial amounts of
“trapped earnings” abroad, tax holidays became a strategic tax planning tool of US multinationals. Along
with the transition to a territorial international tax system, the reform further provides for a one-time
deemed repatriation tax of deferred foreign corporate profits at a rate of 15.5% (cash assets) and 8%
(illiquid assets).
5
Michael Devereux, Rachel Griffith and Alexander Klemm (2002) analyze the development of taxes on
corporate income in EU and G7 countries over the 1980s and the 1990sthey establish that tax revenues on
profitable investments had fallen. In particular, taxes on income earned by multinational firms are subject
to tax competition forces. Additional evidence pertaining to international tax competition for
relatively mobile portfolio investments, so that a country with more mobility has lower capital
tax rates, is abundant; see empirical support for the hypothesis in Hines (1999), Sorensen
(2002), Besley, Griffith and Klemm (2001), Devereux and Griffith (2002), and Lassen and
Sorensen (2002), Razin, Sadka, and Nam (2004), and Krautheim and Schmidt-Eisenhor (2011).

One can clearly detect in Figure 2 a noticeable breakpoint pointing to a significant
corporate income tax cuts, at the end of the 1980s in the wake of the single market launch
in mid 1990s. Overall, the mean EU effective corporate tax rate went down from 42% in
1975 to 32% in 2000, and the standard deviation went down from 8% in 1975 to 5.8% in
2000.
IV. Declining Welfare State: Evidence
The general rules of making the welfare state less generous are quite straightforward:
lower taxes on capital income, and highly mobile labor, and curtail benefits.

6

These calculations are based on the well-known work of Hall and Jorgenson (1967) who introduced the user cost of
capital approach; applied to international data by King and Fullerton (1984). Figure 1 follows the formula for the
effective tax rate on corporate income (𝜏 ) as refined by Auerbach (1983):

𝑟 𝛿 1 𝜏

where
− Real cost of funds (real rate of return the firm must earn after corporate taxes by the instruction of its
shareholders).
𝛿− physical rate of depreciation (assumed exponential)
𝜏 − statutory corporate tax rate
− Present value of depreciation allowances.

In recent years, at the same time that the financial integration of the world economy built
up, most of the large industrialized economies have embarked on a track of trimming the
generosity of their pension and other welfare-state programs. This is not a coincidence.
Financial integration lower the tax on the mobile factor, capital, and weakens the capital
income tax base. Caminada et al (2010) explored EU welfare-state indicators. Using a
variety of indicators of social protection: social expenditures, both at the macro and at
the program level, replacement rates of unemployment, and social assistance benefits and
poverty indicators.7 Together, these indicators may provide a relatively broad picture of
the evolution of social protection in the EU. Table 1 demonstrates that the initial level of
public social expenditure prior to the creation of the EU, has a negative effect on the on
EU provision of public social services well after EU has been established. We conjecture
that these patterns may have to do, among other things with the globalization forces that
were unleashed by the integration of Europe.

Table 1. Convergence of Public Social Expenditures in EU‐15 Controlled for Cyclical and
Demographic Effects, 1985–2003

They linearly regress the annual growth rate of several social protection indicators on the initial level of
the social protection indicator at the beginning of the period. The coefficient for absolute β-convergence is
estimated using an ordinary least square regression model of cross-sectional data. If the coefficient β is
negative (positive), we say that there is absolute convergence (divergence) in social protection levels
across countries. The higher the value of β, the faster the social protection indicator in the poor region
converges toward the level of the rich one. The hypothesis to test is that coefficient β is negative.

A Stripped-down Model

To put financial globalization, tax competition, and the generosity of the welfare state into a
coherent analytical framework we develop here an international-tax- competition model where the
welfare state parameters (taxes and social benefits) are determined through majority voting (Razin
and Sadka 2018). We consider a two-period small open economy which responds to exogenously
given world interest rate, taxes, an imperfect accessibility to international capital markets and
strong elements of source-based taxation. The welfare state provides a uniform social benefit. This
social benefit captures the various ingredients that the welfare state accords, such as health
services, education, in-kind transfers, and so on. Domestic taxes on labor income and capital
income are proportional. The degree of globalization is captured by the ease of moving capital
abroad. We employ a stripped-down model which includes the bare elements that will enable us
to study key implications of international capital flows and international tax competition on the

13

welfare state. We assume a pure source-based (territorial) taxation. This means that the country
does not impose taxes on foreign-source income. 8
The representative producer equity-finance its activity, and all international capital flows are in
the form of equity securities.9 We consider a two-period small open economy which responds to
exogenously given world interest rate, taxes, and an imperfect accessibility to international capital
markets. There is one all-purpose composite good (allowing us to abstract from trade issues) which
can serve for both consumption and capital investment. There are two types of factors of
production—capital (K) and labor (L). The workers have two types of skills—low (l) and high (h).
The production function is Cobb-Douglas,
(3)

𝐹 𝐾, 𝐿

𝐴𝐾 𝐿

,

With constant returns to scale, where A

0 is a total productivity parameter, and 𝛼 and 1

𝛼 are,

respectively, the capital and labor shares.

Under the source (territorial) principle of international taxation only income from domestic
sources are subject to a tax, whereas foreign‐source income is exempt. Under the residence
principle, in contrast, income is taxed on a world‐wide basis. Razin and Sadka (2017) illustrate
diagrammatically the efficiency dis‐advantage of the equilibrium under the source principle,
compared to the residence equilibrium. Because the consumption possibilities frontier shrinks
under the source principle, relative to the frontier under the residence principle, the latter is
more efficient. However, tax revenue collection is larger under the former, because of the
existence of tax havens and lack of sufficient international tax coordination.
Evidently, debt flows have a special tax treatment deserve a rigorous separate analysis; they
will not be considered here.
9

14

Individuals live for two periods (1, and 2), so that there are essentially two consumption goods:
first-period consumption (𝑐 ) and second-period consumption (𝑐 ). Labor is internationally
immobile, whereas capital is mobile. Individuals can direct their savings at home and/or abroad.

The total size of the population is normalized to one. Labor supply (L) is measured in efficiency
units. We assume that there are 𝛾 high-skill individuals, each providing one efficiency unit of
labor, and 1

𝛾 low-skill individuals, each providing 𝜌

1 efficiency units of labor. Thus, total

labor supply in efficiency units is given by

Where 𝑚 denotes the emigration of skilled individuals. Emigration depends on skilled utility
level:

𝑚

𝑚 𝑢

The lower the skilled utility, 𝑢 , is, the higher is the rate of emigration, 𝑚 .
Capital is invested in the first period and output accrues in the second period. Factor remunerations
are also paid in the second period.
The wage per efficiency units and the domestic return to capital, are given by the marginal
productivity conditions:

Denoting the domestic tax rate on capital by 𝑡 , arbitrage possibilities yield:

The parameter 𝛿 captures (albeit in a mechanic way) a group of frictions, contractual and
informational. Such frictions, which affect the volume and the composition and the volatility of international
10

capital flows, cause deviations from the “law of one price”. As an example, foreign direct investors get more
efficient outcomes than foreign portfolio investors because the former have more direct control over management.
Thus, they are able to make a better-informed decision of how to run the business. However, the better information
mires FDI investors with the “lemons” problem: If the investors’ liquidity dries up, forcing the investors to sell off
foreign subsidiaries, market participants would not know whether the subsidiary is liquidated because of the
investors’ liquidity problems or because of bad inside information about the profitability of the subsidiary.
Consequently, the market will place a discount on assets sold by an FDI investor, who has the inside information,
unlike the FPI investor.

16

For the sake of simplicity, we consider only the case where the equilibrium levels of saving abroad
is positive; that is there are capital outflows but not capital inflows.11
Each high-skill individual is endowed with one unit of the composite good in the first period; a
low-skill individual is endowed only with 𝜃

1 units. Thus, an h-skill individual enjoys both

higher initial endowment (“wealth”), and higher labor market skill than the l-skill individual.
We assume Cobb-Douglas preferences for both types of individuals,

We have done various simulations with different specification: (1) social benefit and private consumption are
perfect substitutes; (2) The social benefit sub‐utility enters the utility function multiplicatively. However,
qualitative results are similar for a variety of these specifications.

As was already mentioned, taxes are levied, and social benefits are granted only in the second
period. Nevertheless, these policy variables are determined, announced, and committed to, already
in the first period by the fully informed, and dynamically consistent policy makers.
Our objective is to study how these policies respond to changes in the process of globalization,
driven by changes in the parameters 𝑡 ∗ , 𝑟 ∗ , and 𝛿. In particular, the response of b may be viewed
as the effect on the generosity of the welfare state, and the effect on 𝑡

captures the international

tax competition. We are also interested in the effects on the consumption-equivalent utility levels
to gauge the effects of globalization on income distribution, and the benefits from globalization.
For this purpose, and given the multitude forces at play, we resort to numerical simulations.

19

VI. Model’s Predictions
The degree of globalization is captured by the ease of moving capital abroad. Specifically, we
assume that there is some cost, 𝛿, per unit of investment abroad. By raising the cost parameter, we
raise or lower the intensity of globalization. The incentive for engaging in tax competition is
triggered by lowering the foreign tax on capital, 𝑡 ∗ .13 Recall that capital flows take only the form
of equity capital, not debt. 14
The degree of globalization is measured by the cost parameter 𝛿. We study therefore the
implications of changing 𝛿 for the economy in general (e.g. the allocation of capital between
domestic and foreign uses), and for the tax burden, its composition, and the generosity of the
welfare state, in particular.
As expected, Figures 3 and 4 show that financial globalization (i.e. lowering 𝛿
Shifts capital from home abroad. This is true no matter whether the high-skill or the low-skill form
the majority. Naturally, both capital invested at home and abroad, are higher when the high-skill
form the majority, than when the low-skill form the majority.

Note that 𝛿, 𝑟 ∗ , and 𝑡 ∗ are indistinguishable as the relevant economic parameter is 1
1 𝑡 ∗ 𝑟 ∗ 𝛿.
14
Although in the absence of uncertainty and information and contractual frictions the model equilibrium
configurations is either exclusive capital exports or exclusive capital imports, with frictions equilibrium may include
capital exports of assets and capital imports of other assets, all at the same time. Indeed, U.S. is both equity
capital exporter and debt capital importer.

Also, as domestic capital falls with financial globalization, the rate of return of domestic capital
rises and the wage rate falls.
Turning our attention to the welfare-state system, Figures 5 and 7 show that financial globalization
shifts the tax burden away from domestic capital income to labor income. It also lowers the total
tax burden, and consequently, the provision of the social benefit (b). These results obtain regardless
of which skill type form the majority. Naturally, the tax rates on capital and labor are higher when
a low-skill type form the majority, than when the high-skill type forms the majority.

Comparing the levels of the social benefit under the two regimes, there are two forces at play. On
the one hand, the tax rate is higher under a low-skill majority. On the other hand, the economy is
less productive when the low-skill labor is the larger component of the labor force. This force
25

reduces the total tax revenues. In our simulations, the second effect dominates. As a result, the
social benefit (b) is lower under the low-skill regime.
Turning now to who is the winner and who is the loser from financial globalization, we note that
the issue is far from being a straightforward application of a gains-from-trade argument. For an
existence of Pareto improvement to work in a multi-consumer economy, it is an essential to have
a specific way for the redistribution policy, so as to compensate the losers by taxing the winners.
However, our model’s redistribution system is constrained by who is the majority, low-skilled or
high-skilled.

Figures 8 and 9 indicate that thanks to the existence of the welfare state tax-transfer policies,
financial globalization leads to a Pareto improvement. Both skill types, regardless of who form the

28

majority, benefit from financial globalization.15 We can also demonstrate that both skill types
benefit. 16

15

Note that we assume perfect substitution between the two labor skill types and complementarity
between capital and labor. If there is complementarity‐ relation between all factors of production, our
result is still valid. Krusell et al (2000), who analyzed US data, decompose capital into equipment and
structures. They were able to track wage gap for the years 1960 to 1990 and show that capital
accumulation explains most of the rise in wage inequality. Note, however that capital which leaves the
domestic economy as a result of financial globalization (and escape tax under the source‐territorial tax
principle domestic taxes), with input‐substitutability between low‐skilled labor and capital, tends to
raise low‐skilled wages and raise the domestic return to capital that they own.

As utility is ordinal, we cannot just compare whose utility rises by more. Instead, we calculate
a sort of consumption equivalent to the utility. Specifically, we ask what a uniform percentage
increase in both present and future consumption generates the same increase in ordinal utility as
generated by the financial globalization (the change in 𝛿). Formally, denote this percentage
increase
by
𝑥 𝛿 ,i
l, h.

VII. Role of the welfare state
To highlight the role of the welfare state in safeguarding the globalization gains for all (the
unskilled-poor individuals and the skilled-rich individuals), we consider in this section the extreme
case where the welfare state does not exist (that is, 𝑡 , 𝑡 and b are all set equal to zero).

Figure 10: Financial Globalization without welfare state: utility of the high skill type

30

Figure 11: Financial Globalization without welfare state: utility of the low high skill type

Figure 12: Financial Globalization without welfare state: The Gini coefficient

31

Figures 10-12 demonstrate that without having the welfare state redistribution, the consequences
of the financial globalization are that the high skill-rich individual gain, while the low-skill poor
lose. Consequently, income inequality worsens. Thus, as shown in the previous section, the welfare
state tax and transfer features, although politically controlled by the self-interest majority, are key
to guarantee the spread of financial globalization gains to all.

VIII. Conclusion
Capital market globalization affect income distribution in a variety of ways: through its effects on
location and sectoral nature of investment and portfolio composition of savings, wages and rents,
etc. Furthermore, globalization introduces tax competition among countries, and a possibility of a
“race to the bottom”. As a result, the tax burden may shift from the mobile factors (e.g. capital and
top-skilled labor) to the weakly mobile factors (e.g. low skill labor). This shift has first-order
implications for both the functional and the size distribution of income. A country that imposes
high tax rates may push mobile factors (especially capital) abroad where the country cannot
effectively tax them, eroding its own tax base and lowering domestic economic activity at the same
time. A simple framework to study the issue of tax competition is with the aid of a stylized model
with a pure source-based (territorial) taxation. This means that the country does not impose taxes
on foreign-source income. 17
The creation of the single European market is like a “natural experiment” to test the effect of
financial globalization on the fiscal underpinnings of the welfare state.

It uncovered the

phenomenon the race-to-the bottom tax competition which reduces capital income tax revenues. It
generated cross-country re-allocation of capital which had first-order effects on income inequality,
by chipping away at the domestic tax base. The easing a country access to the world capital markets
typically induces also political-economy grounded policy changes that impact income inequality.
The downscaled welfare state nevertheless is able to spread the gains from financial globalization

International tax competition and border tax adjustments of income tax have received increasing public

and scholarly attention since the introduction of the US 2017 US Tax Bill, which shifts corporate taxation
to the source (territorial) principle.

among most income groups, regardless of who the decisive voter is determining the tax-transfer
policies.
Many large industrialized economies have embarked in recent years on a track of trimming the
generosity of their pension and other welfare-state programs. The general rules are quite
straightforward: Raise retirement age and curtail benefits. Following the report of the Greenspan
Committee (January, 1983), the U.S. has gradually raised the retirement age to reach 67 in the
year 2027. Similarly, but much later France, in July 2003 decided to require public sector
workers (about one-fourth of the French workforce) to contribute to the state pension system for
40 years, instead of 37.5 years. Also, Germany, which already raised its retirement age from 63
to 65, is currently contemplating raising it further to 67 between 2011 and 2035. With respect to
curtailing benefits, this is usually accomplished by abandoning wage-indexation in favor of
price-indexation. Naturally, as real wages rise over time (due mostly to productivity increases),
price-indexation is less generous to pensioners than wage-indexation; see Cogan and Mitchell
(2003) for the U.S. and Thode (2003) for Europe. Financial globalization across various
economies is a universal phenomenon to reckon with today. Can the welfare state, financed
partly by high capital taxes survive international tax competition brought about by such
globalization? Evidently, the answer is in it can; and it seems to be crucial to spread the gains
from financial asset trade across various income groups. To demonstrate these points we apply a
political economy model where the pillars of the welfare state system are determined by the
majority group, poor-low skilled or rich-high skilled to assess the forces of globalization.
We have shown that the social benefits decline as financial globalization increases. What are the
gains are for the low-skilled workers that offset the reduction in benefits? It is essentially that
they are getting a higher rate of return on their savings due to greater access to world markets.
34

But in essence their well-being is subject to two conflicting forces that are at play: one hand the
return to their savings rises with the globalization; on the hand, wages and social benefits fall. If
their initial wealth is sufficiently low, and if the low-skilled have preferences that lead them to
save much less relative to their wealth than the high-skilled-rich, then the gains-to-all result
might not hold. However, even in this case they are better off having a welfare state system in
place rather than its absence, to compensate them from depressed wages and declining provision
of social benefits.18
One would naturally expect that as the share of the elderly in the population rises when the
population ages, their political clout would strengthen the pro welfare-state coalition. Similarly,
one would expect this coalition to gain more political power as more low-skill migrants are
naturalized. Thus, aging and low-skilled migration seem to tilt the political power balance in the
direction of boosting the welfare state, imposing a growing burden on the existing workforce.
But this political-balance force conflicts with the fiscal-burden force if aging comes together
with low-skill migration which increases the share of net recipients of the generous welfare state.
But what if the welfare state tries to rely more heavily on capital taxes in order to finance the
social benefits it provides? Recall that the old derive most of their income from capital because
they retired from work. So, at first thought, it may seem that as the share of the old in an aging
population rises, then an attempt to rely more heavily on capital taxes would face a stiffer
political resistance. However, after a careful scrutiny of this hypothesis we come to an
unconventional conclusion: Aging plausibly tilts the political power balance in favor of larger
capital-financed welfare state. Literature cited provides also supportive empirical evidence from

18

Swank and Betz (2003) find that net of the impacts of other political forces, the universal welfare state, as
measured by an index of coverage, generosity and active labor market programs, significantly depresses the votes
of the populistic new political right. Its political clout has increased in Europe by globalization forces (especially
volume of refugees and asylum seekers.

35

the EU for this conclusion. Is the latter conclusion relevant? After all, aging is not the only
process witnessed nowadays.

Immigration produces sizeable demographic changes over time that have first-order effect on
redistribution policy. Most advanced economies face a generational distribution problem that
migration might help with, but migration affects young and old, rich and poor, differently. The
welfare state of these advanced economies is also a magnet for migrants, especially the low-skill.
On the one hand, the native-born older population need young immigrants to support the welfare
state; on the other hand these immigrants may increase the fiscal burden on the native-born young.
How these tensions are to be resolved in the political economy context Razin (2018) and Razin
and Sadka (2005, 2018).address the impact on income inequality, and redistribution policy as a
result of a large wave of skilled immigrants.
Ottaviano and Peri (2012) calculate the effects of immigration on the wages of native US workers
of various skill levels in two steps. In the first step they use labor demand functions to estimate the
elasticity of substitution across different groups of workers. In the second step, they use the
underlying production structure and the estimated elasticities to calculate the total wage effects of
immigration in the long run. In the data-preferred model, they find that there is a small but
significant degree of imperfect substitutability between natives and immigrants which, when
combined with the other estimated elasticities, implies that in the period from 1990 to 2006

36

immigration had a small effect on the wages of native workers with no high school degree (between
0.6% and +1.7%).19 It also had a small positive effect on average native wages (+0.6%) and a
substantial negative effect (−6.7%) on wages of previous immigrants in the long run.

Globalization and income distribution has been studied mostly from the
paradigm perspective.

international- trade

Stolper and Samuelson (1941), early on, explained how increased

international trade with capital-intensive good and labor-intensive good, for labor–abundant and
capital-abundant countries, should reduce the relative wage in the capital-abundant country; hence,
increasing the income gaps between capital and labor. However, Krugman (2008) points that while
standard economic analysis predicts that increased U.S. trade with unskilled labor–abundant
countries should reduce the relative wages of U.S. unskilled labor, a slew of empirical studies in
the 1990s found only a modest effect. Yeaple (2005) demonstrates that a reduction in variable
trade costs prompts more firms to adopt the better technology in the differentiated product sector.
The most-able workers among those who operate the inferior technology switch employment to
firms who operate the more advanced technology, As a result, the least able workers among those
who operated the inferior technology switch employment to the traditional sector. Hence, the wage
gap between able and less able workers rises. Helpman (2018), however, with a comprehensive

Ottaviano and Peri (2012) emphasize that a production function framework is needed to combine own-group
effects with cross-group effects in order to obtain the total wage effects for each native group. In order to obtain a
parsimonious representation of elasticities that can be estimated with available data, Authors adopt alternative
nested-CES models and let the data select the preferred specification. New to this paper is the estimate of the
substitutability between natives and immigrants of similar education and experience levels.
