    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper considers two central problems in our statistical frameworks which impair the ability to use wealth to assess economic sustainability or the impacts of economic downturns.  Some increases in wealth may reflect increased economic rents\u2014in particular, land and exploitation rents\u2014and their capitalized value, unrelated to an increase in the productive capacity of the economy.   Another major problem in our wealth accounts is the \u201cmissing capital\u201d required to explain   the marked decrease in economic output, at the time of the recession and in the years following, that cannot be fully accounted for by a decrease in measured inputs.  When account is taken of this missing capital, the adverse effects of austerity appear much greater than suggested by the standard national income accounts.\n\n",
