    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper estimates the effects of intranational and international R&D spillovers on the cost and production structure for ten Canadian and Japanese manufacturing industries.  Domestic spillovers generate greater effects on average variable cost and factor intensities compared to international spillovers between the two countries. Private and social rates of return to R&D are calculated for each industry in both countries.  Social rates of return to R&D are one and one-half to twelve times the private returns.  The Canadian social rates of return are generally two to three times higher than the Japanese rates.\n\n",
