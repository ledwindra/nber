    "abstract": "\n\nDigital platforms are not only match-making intermediaries but also establish internal rules that govern all users in their ecosystems. To better understand the governing role of platforms, we study two Airbnb pro-guest rules that pertain to guest and host cancellations, using data on Airbnb and VRBO listings in 10 US cities. We demonstrate that such pro-guest rules can drive demand and supply to and from the platform, as a function of the local platform competition between Airbnb and VRBO. Our results suggest that platform competition sometimes dampens a platform wide pro-guest rule and sometimes reinforces it, often with heterogeneous effects on different hosts. This implies that platform competition does not necessarily mitigate a platform's incentive to treat the two sides asymmetrically, and any public policy in platform competition must consider its implication on all sides.\n\n",
    "acknowledgement": "\nWe study a recent Airbnb rule that mandates guest reservations to be fully refundable within 48 hours of booking. Using data from ten US cities, we find (i) the rule leads to higher prices and higher occupancy for Airbnb listings, (ii) the number of active listings increases less on Airbnb than on VRBO, and (iii) some Airbnb hosts react by multi-homing on VRBO and lowering service quality on Airbnb. Platform competition attenuates the first effect but strengthens the third, suggesting that the nature of platform competition is more intricate than a stylized theory of positive network effects would predict.
