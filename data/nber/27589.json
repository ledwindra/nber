    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper  investigates empirically the role of the commodity price super cycle in explaining real activity in developed and emerging economies. The commodity price super cycle is defined as a common permanent component in  real commodity prices. Estimates using quarterly and annual data from 1960 to 2018  indicate that world shocks that affect  commodity prices and the world interest rate explain more than half   of the variance of output growth on average across countries. However, the majority  of this contribution, more than two thirds,  stems from stationary world shocks. These results suggest that  world disturbances that are responsible for low frequency movements  in commodity prices play an important but not dominant role in driving fluctuations in aggregate activity at the country level.\n\n",
