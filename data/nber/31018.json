    "abstract": "\n\nIn agreements settling patent challenges in the drug industry, the plaintiff brand commonly licenses the defendant generic to sell prior to patent expiry.  Some agreements require the generic to pay the brand royalties.  Despite the superficial flow of profits, royalty terms may function as part of an anticompetitive \u201creverse payment\u201d made to the generic in exchange for delayed entry.  Typically, the brand launches its own authorized generic (AG) during the first-to-file generic\u2019s 180-day exclusivity period so there are two initial generic competitors.  A royalty structure that deters the brand\u2019s AG launch reduces the number of entrants to one, conveying net value to the generic and potentially inducing it to delay its entry.  Our simple model shows that royalties usually have no place in a brand-generic agreement between rational actors.  However, when royalties are conditioned on the brand\u2019s AG launch, a range of royalty rates exists that both conveys net value to the generic and deters the brand from rationally introducing an AG.  Declining royalty terms in a brand\u2019s settlement with a first-to-file generic thus raise a red flag that the agreement is a pay-for-delay.  Although the numbers are small, empirical analysis based on publicly available materials corroborates this conclusion.\n\n",
