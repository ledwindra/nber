Demand for Health Insurance Marketplace Plans Was Highly Elastic in 2014-2015

ABSTRACT
A major provision of the Affordable Care Act was the creation of Health Insurance Marketplaces,
which began operating for the 2014 plan year. Although enrollment initially grew in these
markets, enrollment has fallen recently amid insurer exits and rising premiums. To better
understand these markets, we estimate premium elasticity of demand for Marketplace plans,
using within-plan premium changes from 2014 to 2015, accounting for state-specific trends and
simultaneous changes in generosity. Our preferred estimate implies that a one percent premium
increase reduces plan-specific enrollment by 1.7 percent. We argue that this high elasticity
reflects the rapid growth and high churn in this market, as well as the high degree of
standardization and the availability of many close substitutes.

A major provision of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was the creation of Health
Insurance Marketplaces, online portals for individual, private health insurance that began
operating for the 2014 plan year. The Marketplaces differ from other insurance markets because
they display through a single portal all products from all insurers offering Qualified Health
Plans, with standardized information on premiums and benefits. Marketplace enrollment totaled
eight million customers in 2014, and rose to 11.7 million in 2015 and 12.7 million in 2016. In
2017, enrollment fell to 12.2 million as premiums rose dramatically, and several insurers exited,
leaving many markets with limited competition.11 These changes have been central political and
policy issues in the United States.
We estimate the premium elasticity of demand for Marketplace plans using newly
available data on enrollment and premiums. This elasticity is important for understanding recent
changes in the Marketplaces, and for improving our understanding of consumer price sensitivity
in the individual coverage market. High elasticities imply low optimal premiums, but they may
make it difficult for firms to recover their fixed costs, and could thus lead to firm exit. Using a
within-plan identification strategy to account for unobserved plan quality, we estimate that a 1
percent increase in the premium net of any tax credits lowers demand by 1.7%, higher than
previously estimated demand elasticities for health insurance. We argue that this high elasticity
reflects rapid growth and high churn in this market, as well as the high degree of standardization
and the availability of many close substitutes.
Most prior ACA research has shown only indirect evidence on premium sensitivity. For
example, consumers choose low premium plans (Gabel et al., 2017); informational nudges about
potential savings from switching plans make consumers more likely to make an active choice

(Ericson, Kingsdale, Layton, & Sacarny, 2017); and consumers are more likely to switch from a
plan when its premium increases (HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and
Evaluation Office of Health Policy, 2017). DeLeire and Marks (2015) estimate a premium
elasticity of demand for Marketplace plans, but do not account for unobserved plan quality.
Tebaldi (2016) also estimates demand for Marketplace plans in California, finding much higher
elasticities for young people than for old. Our results complement this work, as we use an
alternative identification strategy, and estimate demand for all states using healthcare.gov.

I.

Background on the Health Insurance Marketplaces
Under the ACA, insurers must charge the same premium to all customers, regardless of

health status. However, premiums vary by age, by tobacco use status, and by geographic rating
areas (GRAs, typically clusters of counties). Insurers may offer plans in all counties in a state, or
only in a subset. The ACA standardizes plans by requiring that they must cover a consistent set
of benefits, with limits on annual out-of-pocket maxima, and no limit on lifetime benefits. The
Marketplace further standardizes the display of benefit information: plans are categorized into
four metal tiers of increasing generosity based on actuarial value: bronze, silver, gold, and
platinum. A “catastrophic” plan is also available to younger persons. The Marketplace interface
highlights metal level, plan deductibles, copayments, coinsurance, and premiums.
The ACA created two types of subsidies for health care: the premium tax credit (PTC)
and cost-sharing reduction (CSR) subsidies. The PTC is a subsidy to make insurance affordable,
an important consideration because the ACA also included a mandate to buy insurance, with a
tax penalty for non-compliance. The amount of the credit depends on household income and on
the premium of the benchmark silver plan in that household’s county; it does not depend on
which plan the consumer eventually chooses. Thus, PTCs do not affect plan choice because they
3

do not affect plans’ relative premiums; the PTC only affects whether consumers purchase any
coverage at all. The CSR subsidy reduces copayments and deductibles for households below 250
percent of the Federal Poverty Level, but only for those choosing silver plans. The Marketplace
displays customer-specific premiums and cost-sharing information that reflect these subsidies.

II.

Data
We use recently released data on plan enrollment in 2014 and 2015 from the Center for

Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight (CCIIO), a division of the Centers for Medicare
and Medicaid Services (CMS). CCIIO reports total enrollment at the plan-state-year level for
each plan offered on Healthcare.gov, the federally-facilitated Marketplace used by 34 states in
2014-2015 (latest years available). We obtained information on premiums, plan generosity, and
metal level from the Qualified Health Plan Landscape file for 2014 and 2015. Because plan
enrollment is available only at the state-year level but premiums vary at the GRA level, we
calculate state-level average premiums for each plan, weighting by the Marketplace-eligible
population of counties in which the plan was offered.2 This approach ignores some premium
variation that occurs across GRAs within the plan-state-year. However, there is little such
variation: 90% of the variation in 2014-2015 premium changes is explained by plan fixed effects.
Table 1 presents summary statistics for the full sample of Marketplace plans and for our analysis
sample, which is limited to plans that have positive enrollment in both 2014 and 2015.

We estimate Marketplace eligible population with the IPUMS USA database (Ruggles, Genadek, Goeken, Grover,
& Sobek, 2015) using a method developed by Drake et al. (2016).

III.

Econometric model

We adopt a discrete choice logit demand framework. We let 𝑖 index enrollees, 𝑗 plans, and 𝑡
markets, which we think of as a state-year. We let 𝐽𝑡 be the set of plans available in market 𝑡.
Plan 𝑗 = 0 indicates the outside option of no coverage or off-exchange coverage.
The conditional indirect utility to enrollee 𝑖 from plan 𝑗 in market 𝑡 is
𝑢𝑖𝑗𝑡 = −𝛼(𝑝𝑗𝑡 − 𝑃𝑇𝐶𝑖𝑡 ) + 𝑋𝑗𝑡 𝛽 + 𝜉𝑗𝑡 + 𝜖𝑖𝑗𝑡 ,
where 𝛼 is premium sensitivity, 𝑝𝑗𝑡 is the gross premium of plan 𝑗 and 𝑃𝑇𝐶𝑖𝑡 is the tax credit
available to person 𝑖 in market 𝑡 (which does not vary across plans).3 Observed product
characteristics 𝑋𝑗𝑡 include dummy variables for deductible levels, state-metal level fixed effects,
and, in some specifications insurer-year-metal level fixed effects. The term 𝜉𝑗𝑡 represents
unobserved quality. It includes provider network characteristics and unmeasured aspects of costsharing, including eligibility for CSR subsidies if 𝑗 is a silver plan.
The conditional indirect utility from non-insurance purchase is
𝑢𝑖0𝑡 = 𝑢𝑖0 − 𝛼𝜏𝑖𝑡 + 𝜖𝑖0𝑡
where 𝑢𝑖0 is a person-specific value of having any insurance coverage, and 𝜏𝑖𝑡 is the mandate
penalty associated with non-purchase of insurance. This specification allows for arbitrary
heterogeneity in the value of having coverage (-𝑢𝑖0 ).
We renormalize utility by subtracting 𝛼𝑃𝑇𝐶𝑖𝑡 from all options. 𝑢𝑖0𝑡 and 𝑢𝑖𝑗𝑡 become
𝑢𝑖0𝑡 = 𝑢𝑖0 − 𝛼(𝜏𝑖𝑡 + 𝑃𝑇𝐶𝑖𝑡 ) + 𝜖𝑖0𝑡
𝑢𝑖𝑗𝑡 = −𝛼𝑝𝑗𝑡 + 𝑋𝑗𝑡 𝛽 + 𝜉𝑗𝑡 + 𝜖𝑖𝑗𝑡 = 𝑢𝑗𝑡 + 𝜖𝑖𝑗𝑡

3

We set the base price 𝑝𝑗𝑡 equal to the age 30 price. Prices vary by age, but by a constant factor across plans (so the
ratio of prices between plans is the same, regardless of age). Rescaling prices for the age curve would not affect our
elasticity estimate, which is already scaled by price. For more details on these tax credits, see CBPP (2017).

5

Mean utility from choosing plan 𝑗 (𝑗 ≠ 0), 𝑢𝑗𝑡 , no longer depends on 𝑖. These equations also
make clear that the PTC affects insurance demand by reducing the relative utility of noncoverage, rather than shifting the value of one plan relative to another.
We assume that 𝜀𝑖𝑗𝑡 is distributed type-1 extreme value. The probability of purchasing
plan 𝑗 is
Pr(𝑗|𝑖𝑡) =

exp(𝑢𝑗𝑡 )
1 + ∑𝑗′∈𝐽𝑡 exp(𝑢𝑗′ 𝑡 )

.

This probability is not 𝑖 specific, so we can aggregate over enrollees 𝑖 to obtain observed market
1

shares 𝑠𝑗𝑡 = 𝑛 ∑𝑖 Pr(𝑗|𝑖𝑡), where 𝑠𝑗𝑡 is enrollment in plan 𝑗 as a share of all eligible in market 𝑡.
Simplifying, we have
𝑠𝑗𝑡
log ( ) = 𝑢𝑗𝑡 = −𝛼𝑝𝑗𝑡 + 𝑋𝑗𝑡 𝛽 + 𝜉𝑗𝑡 .
𝑠0𝑡

(1)

Our goal is to estimate premium sensitivity 𝛼 and calculate own premium elasticities. We
calculate the premium elasticity two ways: with respect to the gross price, and with respect to the
price net of the PTC. The gross price elasticity for plan 𝑗 in year 𝑡 is simply 𝜂𝑗𝑡 =
−𝛼𝑝𝑗𝑡 (1 − 𝑠𝑗𝑡 ). This elasticity is relevant for insurers as it determines how their revenue
changes when their price changes. The net price elasticity, however, elasticity reflects consumer
behavior, and is most comparable to past estimates. The net price elasticity, 𝜂̃, can be found as
𝜂̃𝑗𝑡 = 𝜂𝑗𝑡 𝑟𝑗𝑡 , where 𝑟𝑗𝑡 is the ratio of the net price to the gross price for plan j in year t.4

4

To calculate this elasticity, we need an estimate of 𝑟𝑗𝑡 , which requires knowing PTC amounts. For each state, CMS
reports average monthly PTC amounts in their Effectuated Enrollment Snapshot. See
https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/MarketplaceProducts/Effectuated_Quarterly_Snapshots.html. We calculate the net price for plan 𝑗 in year 𝑡 in a given state as its
gross price, minus the average PTC amount in the relevant state and year. For this calculation, we use the gross price
at the average age of Marketplace enrollees in the given state and year, calculated from CCIIO enrollment data.
Although this approach creates measurement error in the net price, we emphasize we do not use the net price for
estimation, only for transforming our price sensitivity estimate into an elasticity. Thus, our use of this approximation
does not introduce attenuation bias into our regression estimates.

6

We do not estimate equation (1) directly because it is likely that premiums and quality 𝜉𝑗𝑡
are highly correlated. To address this correlation, we assume a fixed effects structure: 𝜉𝑗𝑡 = 𝜉𝑗 +
𝜉̃𝑗𝑡 . We expect that 𝑝𝑗𝑡 is highly correlated with permanent aspects of quality 𝜉𝑗 , but not
necessarily correlated with the innovation in quality 𝜉̃𝑗𝑡 . This is because many aspects of
quality—network, cost sharing, and insurer brand—vary little over time. To deal with the fixed
effect, we estimate a differenced version of equation (1):
𝑠𝑗𝑡

Δ log 𝑠 = −𝛼Δ𝑝𝑗𝑡 + Δ𝑋𝑗𝑡 𝛽 + Δ𝜉𝑗𝑡 (2)
0𝑡

We estimate this equation via ordinary least squares, with increasingly stringent controls
included in Δ𝑋𝑗𝑡 . We always include state fixed effects; in some specifications, we include fixed
effects for state-by-metal level, insurer, or insurer-by-metal level, as well as controls for changes
in quality. Our identification assumption is that within-plan premium changes from 2014 to 2015
are uncorrelated with plan-specific changes in quality, Δ𝜉𝑖𝑡 . Other changes common to all plans
within a state, such as changing Medicaid coverage or healthcare.gov functionality, are captured
by the state fixed effect. The most likely threat to our identification assumption is changes in
generosity, which we address by controlling for changes in deductible level (measured as in
Ericson (2014)), a proxy for more general generosity measures. Our identification strategy is
similar to Curto et al. (2015), who use plan fixed effects to control for premium-quality
correlation.

IV.

Results
Table 2 reports our estimates of premium sensitivity, as well as the elasticity of demand,

based on Equation (2). We begin in column (1) with state fixed effects, and add richer fixed
effects and controls in subsequent columns. Our preferred estimate, in column (3), controls for
7

state-metal level fixed effects and changes in plan deductible. The elasticity with respect to the
gross premium is 4.59 (P<0.001). As the subsidies cover, on average, about 60% of the premium,
the elasticity with respect to the net premium is about 60% smaller, 1.70. In the remaining
columns, we control for insurer-state and insurer-state-metal level fixed effects, which adjust for
insurer-specific changes in networks and advertising. These extra controls do not reduce
premium sensitivity, but they reduce precision. Thus, our preferred specification includes statemetal level fixed effects and deductible controls.
Although our elasticity estimate relies on a parametric model of demand and a withinplan identification strategy, several factors suggest that the estimate is not driven by these
assumptions. First, Figure 1 shows the basic variation underlying our results. It is clear that
premium changes and enrollment changes are highly negatively correlated; this finding is
independent of any functional form for demand. Furthermore, in Table 3 we show that our
results are robust to non-logit specifications, in which we simply regress changes in log
enrollment or changes in log market shares on changes in log premiums and controls.
It is also unlikely that our identification approach—from within-plan premium changes—drives
our high premium elasticity estimates. Plausible failures of our identification assumption imply
that our premium elasticity is too small, not too large. For example, it is possible that unobserved
aspects of generosity change with premiums. However, this would result in a bias towards zero,
as we expect a positive correlation between generosity changes and premium changes.

V.

Discussion
Our estimated elasticity of demand with respect to the premium net of subsidies, 1.70, is

particularly large relative to estimated net price elasticities for employer-sponsored plans, which
range from 0.2 to 0.8. (Abraham, Vogt, & Gaynor, 2006; Bundorf, Levin, & Mahoney, 2012;
8

Curto, Einav, Levin, & Bhattacharya, 2015; Cutler & Reber, 1998; Einav, Finkelstein, & Cullen,
2010; Royalty & Solomon, 1999); it is also larger than the elasticity of 1.15 that Curto et al. have
estimated for Medicare Advantage plans (Curto et al. 2015). Two unusual features of the
Marketplaces likely generate this high elasticity. First, Marketplaces have an unusually large
number of active choosers, both because of rapid market growth from 2014 to 2015, and because
of high “churn” from people entering and exiting the Marketplaces, due to job transitions, new
discovery of the market, or changing Medicaid eligibility. Active choice is important because
past literature has documented substantial inertia in insurance plan choice, leading to low
premium elasticities (Ericson, 2014; Handel, 2013). Indeed, when Royalty & Solomon (1999)
estimate elasticities among switchers—who make active choices, in a context with standardized
plans—they find high elasticities, comparable to ours.
Second, Marketplaces contain standardized plans, including many close substitutes. For
example, the median county in 2015 had 41 Marketplace plans, including 15 silver plans.5
Premium elasticities are likely to be larger when many close substitutes are available. The design
of the Marketplaces themselves, with their standardized presentation of premiums and benefits,
may also raise elasticities (Schmitz & Ziebarth, 2017).6 The Medicare Part D market also
involves standardized presentations, and past research has found large elasticities (between 5 and
6, larger even than those found here) for these plans which are also sold through a centralized
portal (Decarolis, Polyakova, & Ryan, 2015; Lucarelli, Prince, & Simon, 2012).
These results are relevant also for understanding Marketplace performance under possible
ACA replacement plans. Both the American Health Care Act the Better Care Reconciliation Act

Note, however, that Ericson and Starc (2016) find that standardizations of benefits (but not display information) on
the Massachusetts Health Insurance Exchange did not increase price sensitivity.

(the House and Senate replacement plans) preserve the Marketplaces as centralized markets for
purchasing insurance. The high elasticity we document suggests that, on the one hand,
competition can be an effective tool for reducing premiums but, on the other hand, insurers may
find it difficult to turn a profit, and limited entry may be a concern in the absence of subsidies.
These results raise several questions for future research. First, it would be valuable to
know which of the many unusual features of the Marketplaces—growth, churn, product
standardization, and display standardization—drive high premium elasticities. Second, how
desirable is standardization, particularly if it leads to high sensitivity to the transparent features
of the plan? The current display highlights premiums and cost-sharing information. When
information on some dimensions are made easier to find, consumers may feel less incentive to
find information on other features, for example because there is a fixed cost of acquiring any
amount of product information. Although display standardization of premiums may reduce the
likelihood that customers choose overly expensive or even dominated plans (as in Bhargava et al.
(2015)), it also may encourage consumers to focus too much on premiums and cost sharing, and
ignore other relevant but non-salient product characteristics like network composition or
prescription drug formularies.

Notes: Sample consists of all plans offered on health care with positive enrollment in 2014 and 2015 and a unique
linkage between years. Table shows the estimated own-price elasticity of demand from various specifications. All
specifications include controls for deductible level and state-metal level fixed effects. Column (1) is the baseline
specification corresponding to column (3) of table 1. In columns (2)-(4) we regress the change in log size on the
change in log price, as well as the controls; we interpret the price coefficient as the elasticity. We consider
alternative measures of size. In column (2), we treat size as enrollment; in column (3) we treat size as market share
(enrollment divided by total eligibility); in column (4) we treat size as the inside share (plan enrollment divided by
total enrollment). Robust standard errors, estimated by the bootstrap (resampling insurers), in parentheses.

Notes: Sample consists of all plans offered on health care with positive enrollment in 2014 and 2015 and a unique
linkage between years. The figure shows, for each 0.025 bin of the change in log price from 2014-2015, the average
change in log enrollment between 2014 and 2015. We plot the middle 95% of the distribution of Δ ln 𝑝.
