A Multi-Country Approach to Factor-Proportions Trade and Trade Costs
James R. Markusen and Anthony J. Venables
NBER Working Paper No. 11051
January 2005
JEL No. F11
ABSTRACT
Classic trade questions are reconsidered by generalizing a factor-proportions model to multiple
countries, multi-stage production, and country-specific trade costs. We derive patterns of production
specialization and trade for a matrix of countries that differ in relative endowments (columns) and
trade costs (rows). We demonstrate how the ability to fragment production and/or a proportional
change in all countries' trade costs alters these patterns. Production specialization and the volume
of trade are higher with fragmentation for most countries but interestingly, for a large block of
countries, these variables fall following fragmentation. Countries with moderate trade costs engage
in market-oriented assembly, while those with lower trade costs engage in export-platform
production. These two cases correspond to the concepts of horizontal and vertical affiliate production
in the literature on multinational enterprises. Increases in specialization and the volume of trade
accelerate as trade costs go to zero with and without fragmentation.

Trade theory tends to be dominated by two-country models while empirical research
inevitably confronts multi-country data. Theoretical analyses which do assume multiple
countries often rely on product differentiation (Armington or monopolistic-competition) and free
trade, even factor-price equalization to obtain results. Often the models are not solved for world
general equilibrium, especially outside of the factor-price-equalization set.
While rich insights have certainly been gained from the two-country approach, some
inherent limitations of two-ness rule out many interesting and important questions. A couple of
examples for factor-proportions models are as follows. First, suppose that there are three goods
to be produced. With two countries, one country must produce at least two of the goods, so
some specialization patterns are ruled out. Both countries cannot be specialized even if they
have extreme endowment ratios. Second, consider a country with the average world endowment.
In a two-country model, the other country has the same endowment by definition and so a
country with the average world endowment is predicted not to trade, which is surely counter
empirical. Third, consider trade costs. In a two-country world, there is no meaningful sense in
which one country has low trade costs and the other high trade costs. We could never ask how
two countries with the same factor proportions but different trade costs differ in their production
and trade patterns. A fourth example comes from the theory of multinational firms. A twocountry model will generally not support horizontal and vertical firms simultaneously.
These limitations are the motivation for this paper. The purpose of the paper is then to
reconsider a set of classic trade questions where there are multiple countries and those countries
differ in relative endowments and trade costs. We begin by deriving the pattern of production
specialization, trade, factor prices in a standard two-good (X, Y), two-factor (K, L) context. But

1

2
the model is also an excellent vehicle for considering multiple goods and/or the ability to
fragment the production of one good into several stages. Thus we then allow the production of
one good (X) to fragment into two stages, components (C) and assembly (A) and assess how
countries with different factor endowments and trade costs react to this new opportunity.
Several results can be highlighted.
(1) a country’s production specialization increases in the difference between its factor
endowment from the world endowment and decreases in its trade costs in an intuitive way.
(2) when fragmentation is permitted assembled X is non-traded for many countries with
moderate to high trade costs due to double trade-cost incidence (Yi 2003).
(3) countries ideally suited to integrated X production lose from fragmentation, a result
anticipated by Jones and Kierzkowski (2001).
(4) many countries respond to fragmentation by specializing and trading less. A country
may not be suited to integrated X production but have comparative advantage in either C or A.
With fragmentation, it imports the part of X that in which it does not have comparative
advantage, and so its volume of trade falls.
(5) a country with the average world endowment trades a lot, a result which cannot be
true in a two-country model even with fragmentation (the two countries would be identical, so
free trade equals autarky).
(6) fragmentation expands the factor-price equalization set for countries with zero trade
costs (and there may be several such sets), but the new set(s) are at different factor prices.
(7) a pattern resembling horizontal or market oriented-production in the MNE literature
arises for countries with moderate trade costs while a pattern resembling vertical specialization
or export-platform production arises for countries with lower trade costs.
(8) increases in a specialization index and trade volume accelerate both with and without
fragmentation as trade costs are reduced proportionately for all countries.. The convexity of
trade volume with respect to lowering trade costs without vertical specialization seems contrary
to a suggestion by Yi (2003).1

1

In Yi’s (2003) important paper, he shows that standard two-country models without vertical
specialization/fragmentation cannot produce a convex relationship between trade volume and lower trade
costs. We show that this can indeed occur in our multi-country model with country-specific trade costs.

Related literature
Our paper relates to an extensive range of existing literature, both theoretical and

empirical. An early multi-country approach to factor-proportions trade is found in Leamer
(1984) with more recent developments in a series of papers by Davis and Weinstein which move
away from free trade and factor-price equalization (a good review is found in Davis and
Weinstein 2003). Broad treatments of fragmentation are given in Jones (2000) and the articles in
the edited volume of Arndt and Kierzkowski (2001). Venables (1999), Hanson (1998), and
Venables and Limao (2002) considers aspects relevant here and the latter two papers in
particular introduce a multi-country framework and country or region-specific trade costs. We
build upon much of this research, adding new features including solving for world general
equilibrium, developing the systematic relationship between the country-specific characteristics
of endowments and trade costs and the result patterns of specialization and trade.
The theoretical literature on both factor movements and multinationals is related. The
factor-trade literature is related to fragmentation in that it examines the consequences of
allowing more things to be traded, and notes that this need not decrease the volume of trade in
things already traded (Markusen 1983, Norman and Venables 1995). Literature on multinational
firms also inevitably considers a type of fragmentation going back to the horizontal model of
Markusen (1984) and the vertical model Helpman (1984) and Helpman and Krugman (1985).
An integrated approach is given in Markusen (2002), but all of these analyses have the twocountry limitation given above, and Helpman-Krugman in particular rely on zero trade costs and
factor-price equalization.
Turning to the empirical literature, the growth of trade in intermediates and vertical

4
specialization are analyzed by a number of authors including Hummels, Rapoport and Yi (1998),
Yeats (1998), Dickens (1999), Ng and Yeats (1999), Hummels, Ishii and Yi (2001), and Hanson,
Mataloni and Slaughter (2001, 2002). Yi’s (2003) paper presents an insightful integration of
theory and empirical analysis, but the theory sticks with a two-country case (and thus countries
cannot differ in trade costs). We hope that our paper can contribute to this empirical literature by
suggestion new underlying theoretical relationships with empirical implications.

3.

The multi-country model

As noted above, we will work in a world in which there are many countries. The description of
each country draws on standard trade theory ingredients. There are two consumption goods, X
and Y, and all consumers have identical homothetic preferences over these goods. Each country
has fixed endowments of two factors, L and K. Production has constant returns to scale and is
perfectly competitive. Unit cost functions for the two goods are bX (w, r) and bY (w, r), the same
in all countries, where w and r are factor prices.
World prices of the two goods are pX and pY. However, trade is subject to iceberg trade
costs. Thus, if a country with trade costs tX, tY $ 1 on goods X and Y (where tZ = 1 is free trade, Z
= X, Y) imports good X or Y its internal price will be tXpX, tYpY. Conversely, if it exports the
good the price will be pX/tX, pY/tY, as domestic producers only receive a fraction of the world
price. Notice that we assume that these trade costs are incurred both on exports and imports, and
that a particular country has the same values tZ on its trade with all destinations. It is this that
allows us to talk of a clearly defined ‘world price’; it is as if there is a central market place to
which countries export and from which countries import. Of course, this is a fiction, but it is also

5
a great simplification, meaning that we do not have to work with a full matrix of trade costs
between all pairs of countries. It corresponds with reality to the extent that trade costs are just
border costs. For example, if real trade costs are simply port handling costs, then they apply to
all imports regardless of source and exports regardless of destination. Similarly, if the barriers
are non-preferential import tariffs or export taxes, then they are consistent with our model,
although we will ignore revenue that any such tariff barriers might earn.
We add to this basic model the possibility that production in the X sector can be
‘fragmented’ into two separate elements, components, C, and assembly, A. The unit cost
function for good X can therefore be separated into two sub-cost functions, and written
(1)
for all values of factor prices w, r. Writing the unit cost function in this way implies that there is
no direct technical efficiency loss (or gain) in fragmentation. However, a cost saving arises if it
is cheaper to import components than produce them at local factor prices. The world price of
components is denoted pC, and they are subject to trade costs at rate tC.
The equilibrium location of production satisfies a set of inequality relationships. Each
tradeable good (X, Y, C),2 will be produced in a country only if its unit cost is less than or equal
to the import price; and export opportunities mean that the lower bound on unit cost is the export
price, so
(2)
If the unit cost is strictly within this inequality then the country is self-sufficient in the good,

2

Assembly “services” cannot be exported (shipped to the component location to produce X in that
location).

6
while it may export the good if the unit cost is at the lower end, and import it at the upper end.
For assembly activity, equations (1) and (2) need to be used together. For example, consider a
country that uses imported components and exports its output. Its factor prices must satisfy
.

(3)

Notice that assembly potentially faces a double effect of trade costs; trade costs raise the price of
imported components and reduce the returns from exported final output. In the full general
equilibrium the location of production is determined by these inequalities, and goods and factor
prices are determined by market clearing in the usual way. Details are spelt out more fully in
section 3 and in the appendix.
Our strategy for describing the equilibrium has two parts. The first is numerical. We use
GAMS to solve for the multi-country equilibrium and details of the code used and dimensionality
of the problem are given in the appendix. We present results from these simulations in a series
of Figures which describe what countries – differentiated by factor endowments and by trade
costs – produce; what they trade; and values of their factor prices and real incomes. These
Figures indicate the existence of different regimes, in which countries are specialized in different
activities. The second part of our strategy is to characterize analytically these regimes, showing
how they depend on key parameters of the model.

3.

The free trade benchmark

We start with a benchmark case in which all countries have free trade (tZ = 1, for all countries
and for z= X, Y, C). In this and all following numerical work we make the following
assumptions, designed to give a symmetric initial equilibrium.

7
I) Consumer preferences are Cobb-Douglas with expenditure equally divided between
goods.
II) X and Y production are Cobb-Douglas with symmetric factor shares, eg X has labor
and capital shares of 0.43 and 0.57 respectively, and Y has corresponding shares 0.57 and 0.43.
III) Countries are uniformly distributed along a range of labor endowments from L = 0.1
to L = 0.9, and have capital endowments K = 1 - L. Thus the central country has the world
endowment ratio L = K = 0.5.
IV) tZ is the same for all commodities, Z = X, Y, C, although varies across countries. In
this section only, tZ = 1 for all countries.
Our analytical characterizations of the regimes do not rely on these assumptions.
Figures 1a and 1b give the structure of production, level of welfare, and volume of trade
(value of exports plus imports divided by GDP) for the case in which there is no fragmentation.
The horizontal axis is countries in increasing order of labor abundance, i.e. along the line L 0
[0.1, 0.9]. The central country produces the same volume of both goods and has zero trade.
Moving away from this country the structure of production changes according to Rybczynski
effects until the edge of the cone of diversification is reached.3 Countries with endowment ratios
outside this cone are specialized and have high trade volumes (half their production exported and
half their consumption imported). They have lower welfare than countries in the cone of
diversification, reflecting the fact that – since they are specialized -- the marginal rate of
transformation between X and Y is not equal to the world price ratio.

3

In order to deal with potential indeterminancy (multiple equilibria) within the FPE or
diversification set, we impose a very small trade cost of 0.025% on all imports to a country.

8
What happens if the X-sector fragments? We assume that the fragments C and A are
Cobb–Douglas, and that C and A combine in a Cobb-Douglas function to produce X.
Restrictions on factor shares come from equation (1), and throughout the paper it will be
assumed that X is capital intensive relative to Y, and C capital intensive relative to A (these
assumptions simply being a labeling of activities and factors). However, there remain two
possible rankings of the factor intensities of the four activities, as shown below where activities
are ranked from least to most labor intensive:
Case 1:

C

X

Y

A

Case 2:

C

X

A

Y

In this analysis we concentrate on results for case 1, in which assembly and components become
respectively the most and least labor intensive activities. Results for case 2 are qualitatively
similar so we will not analyze it in detail. To be specific, we set labor shares, 8Z, and the share of
components in X production, $, as follows:
Case 1:

8C = 0.20

8X = 0.43

8Y = 0.57

8A = 0.66

$ = 0.5

The structure of production is illustrated in Figure 2 (for case 1) and summarized (for
both cases 1 and 2) in table 1. There are now two cones of diversification and – concentrating on
case 1 – these contain countries in which the Y sector operates, together with either component
production (region 2) or assembly (region 4)The most capital abundant countries only produce
components (region 1), while the most labor abundant just undertake assembly (region 4). 4

4

Figures 1 and 2 report a Herfindahl index of world specialization at the bottom. For each
country, this is the sum of the squared shares of total production (GDP) in activities Y, C, and A. The
maximum value for a country is 1.0 which occurs if it is specialized in one activity only. The minimum
value occurs for a country in autarky and equals 0.375 = (0.50)2 + (0.25)2 + (0.25)2 (shares are: Y = 0.50,
A = C = 0.25). The world index reported is the simple average of this index across countries.

N.B. the boundaries between regions are not in the same position in the two cases.

Factor prices in the no-fragmentation and new fragmentation situations are illustrated in
Figure 3. In the initial situation the wage-rental ratio takes the same value for all countries in the
initial cone of diversification, decreasing with labor-abundance for those outside. With
fragmentation there are two cones (regions 2 and 4) and the wage-rental ratio is the same for all
countries in each of these cones, but different between them. The main point to note is that the
deviations of the wage-rental ratios of the extreme countries (relative to the central country) are
reduced by fragmentation. This comes directly from the fact that the range of factor intensities in
the technology is increased by fragmentation, consistent with the discussion in Jones and
Kierzkowski (2001). Secondly, both FPE cones have different factor prices from the nofragmentation FPE-set prices. The relative price of X falls following fragmentation and
producing Y and (integrated) X is no longer profitable for any country.
The welfare effects of fragmentation are shown in Figure 4 that gives the change in the
real income of each country, expressed as a proportion of initial real income (national income
deflated by the cost of living index, the unit expenditure function). There are two forces at work.
One is that there is an overall world efficiency gain. The world economy has some opportunities

10
open to it that were not previously present, so cannot do worse (there are no distortions). In line
with intuition these gains accrue largely to countries with extreme endowments which – as we
noted above – initially had relatively low welfare as marginal rates of transformation were not
aligned to price ratios. Fragmentation means that technologies are now available which, in some
sense, provide a better match for their endowments.
The other force is that the terms of trade have changed. The price of good X has now
fallen relative to the price of Y, as fragmentation of X allows it to be produced more efficiently.
Countries with labor endowment of less than 0.5 were initially exporters of X, and those with
labor endowment greater than 0.5 were importers. The welfare implications are clear from
Figure 4, in which we see a range of countries – large initial exporters of X but not countries
with ‘extreme’ endowments – experiencing welfare loss. These countries were ideally suited to
integrated X production initially, and lose due to the term-of-trade deterioration even if they
adjust to a new pattern of specialization.
We make one final remark on our benchmark case. This is that fragmentation increases
the volume of trade for most countries, but not necessarily all, as shown in Figure 5. The reason
is clear. Consider a country with labor endowment approximately equal to 0.67 in Figure 5. In
the initial situation its VOT measure was unity, as it was importing all its consumption of X
(Figures 1a, 1b). But it is not that it is bad at producing X per se, it is just unsuited to producing
components. With fragmentation, its consumption of X is met from local assembly, so it is
importing just components not finished products, and pays for this with smaller exports of Y. Its
trade volume therefore falls. Fragmentation allows a country to import just that part of a good
which it is not good at producing rather than the whole thing.

11
It is interesting to note that the correlation between welfare and trade volume changes is
far below unity in Case 1 (0.66) and negative in Case 2 (not shown). This may be of some
interest and relevance to research on trade openness, measured by the volume of trade, and
growth. We return to the issue of the volume of trade in greater detail in section 6.

4.

Factor endowments and trade costs; world equilibrium with and without fragmentation

We now move to our core model, in which countries differ in both relative endowments and trade
costs. This model captures the interaction between factor endowments and trade barriers in
shaping countries’ trade and specialization. We start off by presenting results from numerical
simulation, solving for the world general equilibrium of the multi-country model.
First, we show how countries with different characteristics engage in different activities
and have different trade patterns. Based on this we interpret results in terms of the theories of
trade and foreign investment, and demonstrate how our approach nests many of the cases and
models that are in the existing literature. Then we characterize analytically the regimes, showing
how these depend on key parameters of the model. Finally, in this section, we turn to real
income and factor price effects.

4.1

Production and trade

Results from numerical simulations are shown in Figures 6-11 that have countries’ labor
endowments on the horizontal axis (retaining the assumption that K = 1 - L), and their trade costs
on the vertical axis, giving values of t - 1 (i.e., the ad valorem component of trade costs). Thus,
each point in the diagram corresponds to a particular country. Countries in the same row have

12
the same trade costs and countries in the same column have the same factor endowments.5
The pattern of specialization without fragmentation is given in Figure 6. The bottom
edge of this corresponds exactly to Figure 1a, and outcomes above this line are exactly as would
be expected. The set of countries that are non-specialized widens with increased trade costs as
does the band in which there is no trade6. On either side of the latter are cones of diversification;
in the left hand cone relatively labor scarce countries export X, the capital intensive good, and
have a higher wage-rental ratio than do relatively labor abundant countries in the right hand
cone, except at free trade (bottom row). Areas of specialization occur at more extreme
endowments, but the range of such endowments diminishes as trade costs get higher.
Specialization thus increases with more extreme factor endowments and/or lower trade costs.
The effect of fragmentation is given in Figure 7, and initially appears very complex. The
bottom row, free trade, gives the same pattern as shown in Figure 2. As would be expected, there
is a lot of specialization among the low-trade-cost countries (C, CY, Y, YA, A). At higher trade
costs we see much less specialization, such as the pattern CA, CYA, no trade, CYA, YA, for
moderate trade costs. In general, countries are more specialized when trade costs are lower, as
in Figure 2. However, it is no longer generally true that countries are more specialized the more
their endowment ratio differs from 1.

5

We push the limits of the software (GAMS, MPS/GE) to obtain as fine a grid as possible: we
have 41 values of factor endowments (as in figures 1-5) and 31 levels of trade costs for a total of 1271
countries. The model consists of 29,236 inequalities with an equal number of complementary variables.
The full model is outlined in appendix 1.
6

See Norman and Venables (1995) for analysis of this in a two-country Edgeworth-box
framework. In many cases, analytical solutions for boundaries are possible but it becomes tedious in our
fragmentation case with many relevant boundaries. As an illustration, Appendix 2 solves for the
boundaries between specialization and diversification, and between autarky and positive trade shown in
Figure 6.

13
The location of production and pattern of trade for each activity separately is seen by
looking at Figure 7 in conjunction with Figure 8 giving trade patterns. Subscript ‘e’ denotes
exports of the good, ‘m’ denotes imports, and ‘0’ denotes no trade in that good. Labeling
concentrates on A and C, with the pattern of trade in Y generally apparent from the these two,
except in the southwest and southeast corners, where there are three sub-regimes each as
indicated.
Component production is the least labor intensive activity, and consequently components
are produced in and exported from labor scarce regions in Figure 8. At high trade costs it is only
the least labor abundant countries that export components, although a wider range of countries
produce them just for local consumption.
Assembly activity is the most labor intensive activity, so is produced and exported by the
most labor abundant regions. Comparing components and assembly, we see that a much wider
range of countries produce A for local consumption only (A0) than are self-sufficient in C (C0).
This asymmetry arises because of the double trade costs that are borne by exports of assembled
products using imported inputs. Thus, a country in the upper right area of Figure 8 imports
components and undertakes assembly just for the local market. Exporting the final product
incurs a double trade cost penalty as components are imported and then re-exported embodied in
the assembled product.
Good Y has intermediate factor intensity, and is consequently produced in and exported
by regions with intermediate factor endowments. Y is imported by countries that are very labor
abundant, and also by those that are very labor scarce. The fact that there is a trade-direction
reversal as we move up some columns on the right (not shown) is perhaps not intuitive. What

14
happens is that, at very low trade costs, the countries on the right are specialized in A (Figure 7)
and thus import Y. But as trade costs increase, importing and then re-exporting C becomes
costly, and the countries import C only for assembly for local sale. They pay for C by exporting
Y.

4.2

Vertical and horizontal specialization:

Figure 9 presents results in a form that helps tie the paper to the literature on multinational firms.
Four regions are marked on the Figure;
MO(h):

countries for which assembly = local market sales; some or all components
are imported.

MO(p):

countries for which assembly = local market sales; some components are
exported.

EP(p):

countries that export assembled X produced with imported components.

EP(h):

countries that import assembled X and export components.

‘MO’, short for market-oriented, describes the fact that all countries in these regions are
meeting local demand for good X entirely from local assembly; they neither import nor export
the good. This is similar to the notion of horizontal or local market-oriented investments used in
the literature on foreign direct investment. For example, suppose that we were to assume that
firms undertaking local assembly from imported components are affiliates of foreign components
producers. A country exporting the components is then a parent, denoted (p) in the Figure, and a
country assembling from imported components is a host, denoted (h) in the Figure. This added
notation is needed because there is no necessary bilateral link between a parent and host as in
two-country models and similarly there is no reason that the number of parent and host countries

15
by own definition is the same.
‘EP’ denotes export-platform production, by which we mean assembly of imported
components for re-export as finished X. This correspond to the notion of vertical or exportplatform investments in the foreign direct investment literature. If again we were to suppose that
assemblers are affiliates of component producers, then countries in the region EP(p) have parent
firms shipping components to affiliates in countries EP(h) for assembly and re-export (in
addition to meeting local demands).7
Several important points emerge from Figure 9. The first is that the same basic model
generates both market-oriented and export-platform activity, occurring simultaneously but for
different sets of countries. The division of countries into those engaging in market-oriented
activity and those engaging in export-platform depends primarily on trade costs, while
specialization in components or in assembly is determined primarily by factor endowments. We
will investigate the boundaries between these regimes, and undertake some comparative statics in
following sections.
Second, the impact of these regimes on trade volumes is qualitatively quite different. The
shaded areas in Figure 9 shows countries for which trade volume falls following fragmentation.
The regions of falling trade volume are largely (although not entirely) contained with the ‘MO’
regions of Figure 9.8 These are regions where fragmentation means that instead of importing or

7

Of course, this bilateral pairing are not determined in this model in which goods are traded on a
world market. The regions EP(p) and EP(h) correspond to what Hummels Rapoport and Yi (1998),
Hummels Ishii and Yi (2001) and Yi (2003) term “vertical specialization”: a country exports an
intermediate and re-imports it as a finished good (EP(p)) or imports an intermediate and re-exports it as a
finished good (EP(h)).
8

The ‘MO’ regions is that Figure 9 describes the equilibrium with fragmentation, while the
shaded regions are a comparison between this and the non-marginally different equilibrium without

16
exporting complete X products, countries import or export components, with assembly of X
undertaken locally. This is trade reducing. In line with the multinationals’ literature, this
market-oriented activity substitutes for trade while the export-platform activity we identify in
Figure 9 is a complement to trade.
These results are interesting for the multinationals’ literature which has focused on
country characteristics as determinants of whether or not activity is market-oriented or exportplatform, although it frequently identifies trade costs as an inducement to market-oriented
activity and a deterrent to export-platform activity. Our results break the two-country restrictions
of the existing literature, and show how both country relative endowments and country trade
costs determine whether one is a parent or a host, and whether the activity is market-oriented or
export-platform.

4.3

Trade volumes

Figure 10 is the final diagram of this section; for clarity, results are viewed with the high-tradecost countries in the foreground (the nearest row is the top row of the previous diagrams). The
top panel, Figure 10A presents the volume of trade as a share of GDP without fragmentation.
The areas of autarky, partial specialization and trade, and complete specialization are rather
obvious.
Figure 10B shows results with fragmentation. This Figure illustrates the asymmetries
introduced, and shows the dual role of trade costs and endowments in determining trade volume.
The largest trade volumes are for countries specialized in assembly. Their imports of

fragmentation.

17
components are 100% of GDP (components and assembly are of equal value) and imports of Y
are 50% of GDP. Thus imports and exports are 150% of GDP and total trade is three times GDP.
Countries specialized in components export 100% of GDP and import 50% in X and 50% in Y,
so their trade is two times GDP. A comparison of Figures 10A and 10B gives a feel for the
shaded areas of Figure 9 where trade volume decreases following fragmentation.9

4.4

Analysis:

So far we have illustrated production and trade regimes. However, a full characterisation of the
equilibrium for any country depends on both what is produced and what is traded. There are four
generic types. The first is that a country is specialized in production of a single good which it
exports, while importing the other goods. The second is that the country produces two goods,
one of which is exported and the other not traded; the third good is imported (partial
specialization). Third, there are ‘Heckscher-Ohlin’ economies in which two goods are produced
and traded; the third good is either imported or produced and not traded. Finally, there is
autarky. Each of these cases gives different comparative statics and we discuss them in turn,
focusing on the determinants of factor prices. Notice also that each generic type can involve
trade and specialization in different goods, this giving 18 different regimes, illustrated and
characterized in Appendix 3 Figure and table.

Specialization:
9

We do not show the change in welfare following fragmentation because it doesn’t add much to
what is clear in Figure 4. There is a block of countries with endowments in the range shown in Figure 4
and low to moderate trade costs that lose from fragmentation. Again, this is a simple terms-of-trade effect
in which fragmentation lowers the relative price of X.

18
In regions in which countries are specialized in production of one good – say good j – factor
prices are determined by two equations. One says that unit costs equal unit export receipts, and
the other says that the factor intensity of the sector equals the relative abundance of factors;
(4)
In this case the level of factor prices depends on trade costs (first equation), but the factor price
ratio does not. The factor price ratio is determined by technology and the country’s factor
abundance, as can be seen by differentiating the second equation and using the definition of the
elasticity of substitution to give
.

(5)

where FA = 1 in our Cobb-Douglas example.

Partial Specialization:
The second type of regime is where only one good is produced and traded, but a second good is
non-traded. Equations (4) above are then modified by the fact that the employment in the sector
is the economy’s factor endowment net of factor usage in the non-traded sector, this changing the
right hand side of the second equation. Comparative statics are then complex, as moving around
either endowment space or trade cost space may change the volume of non-traded output.

‘Heckscher-Ohlin’ economies:
Economies in which there are two goods that are both produced and traded (the same goods) have
factor prices determined by the equality of price (world price trade cost adjusted) to unit costs.

19
For example, consider the region in which countries produce and import good Y and produce and
export X using imported components. The following conditions hold:
.

(6)

Stolper - Samuelson effects give the dependence factor prices on trade costs, although these must
be generalised to incorporate imported inputs. Denoting labor share in costs 8j and the share of
components in production by $, we derive:

(7)

As usual, factor prices move in opposite direction according to relative factor intensities. The
presence of intermediate goods ($ > 0) amplifies the impact of variation in trade costs on factor
prices.
Several further points are noteworthy. First, the equations are different in each of the
different Heckscher-Ohlin regions; there is even a region where both the goods that are produced
are exported, and a third good is imported but not produced. Second, notice that in these regions
factor prices vary with trade costs but not with factor endowments; in specialized regions the
reverse was true. Finally, it is possible that a third good is produced in the economy but not
traded; this uses up some of the endowment, but does not affect the determination of relative
factor prices.
Overall then, we see that Heckscher-Ohlin insights remain useful, but (i) H-O properties

20
only hold over a small subset of the space. And (ii), even where H-O properties hold they depend
on trade cost inclusive prices, and are for different combinations of goods. The appropriate
technology matrix differs – not because of international technology differences, but because
countries lie in different cones – so simple tests of H-O propositions are quite inappropriate. 10

Comparative statics: globalisation in a multi-country world

The patterns identified in the preceding section provide a synthesis of the different ways in which
countries participate in the world economy, integrating theories of trade, market-oriented
investment and export-platform investment. The question we now seek to address is: as trade
costs fall in the world economy, what happens to countries’ trade and specialization, to the
volume of trade and to countries’ and individuals’ real income levels?
The effect on production/trade regimes is illustrated by comparing Figure 11 and Figure 9.
Treating Figure 9 as a base case, the left-hand panel of Figure 11 doubles each country’s trade
cost while the right-hand panel cuts it in half. As expected, reducing trade costs has the effect of
stretching all MO and EP regions upwards, as countries that previously had high trade costs now
face lower ones. In addition to these direct effects there is a reduction in the world price of X
relative to Y, as it is fragmented X production that gains most from lower trade costs. The
important point to note is that falling trade costs causes a range of capital abundant countries to
close down X assembly, instead importing X from labor abundant countries. At the same time a
range of labor abundant countries switch from appearing ‘import substituting’ (assembling X

10

For a verification of the empirical importance of this point and the existence of multiple cones
in particular, see Bernard, Jensen and Schott (2001). For the US, presumably a relatively low trade-cost
set of regions (states), they support a model with at least three factor-price cones.

21
goods just for local consumption: MO(h)) to becoming export oriented (exporting assembled X
goods: EP(h)).
This change is associated with dramatic increases in the degree of specialisation and the
volume of world trade relative to income. Figure 12 has on the horizontal axis a measure of
world trade costs and average Herfindahl index of production specialization as defined in
footnote 4 on the vertical axis. The trade cost is a scaling factor, whereby all countries have their
trade costs scaled up and down by this multiple; 1 is the central case value where each country
has the trade costs in Figures 6-10.11
The uppermost of the positively sloped lines is the Herfindahl index of specialisation
when fragmentation is possible (HERFY); the lower line is the same index computed when
fragmentation is not possible (HERFN). A similar pattern is recorded for the volume of trade
measures with (VOTY) and without (VOTN) fragmentation in Figure 13. Our modeling of
fragmentation therefore offers a simple explanation for the convex response of trade volumes to
lower trade costs studied by Yi (2003) and others, but in our case we get the result even without
vertical specialization.
A comparison of our result and that of Yi (2003) is not straightforward: they are different
models and thus we are not suggesting any contradiction. Indeed, trade expansion at the
extensive margin (more things traded, more countries trading) as well as at the intensive margin
(more volume of trade in the same stuff by the same countries) is important in both papers. In our
model without fragmentation, trade does expand at the extensive margin with a proportional

11

0.15

Thus, comparing points 0.5, 1, and 1.5 a country with initial t - 1 = 0.1 has costs, 0.05, 0.1,

22
lowering of all countries’ trade costs as more countries are drawn out of autarky and into world
trade: more countries trade in addition to more trade by existing traders.
But our model is richer in that it reveals important difference among countries hidden by
the aggregate statistics in Figures 12-13. This can be can be seen by focusing on a set of
countries which initially transit through the experience of horizontal then export-platform
activity. Figures 14 and 15 are analogous to Figures 12 and 13, but just report the average
Herfindahl indices and trade volumes for countries that, in the central case of Figure 9, were
largely engaged in horizontal activity (to be precise, 22 out of 41 countries, those with centralcase trade costs of 0.091 and labor endowments in the range 0.20-0.40 and 0.60-0.80). Since all
these countries have the same trade costs, their actual costs are shown on the horizontal axis
rather than the scaling factor (so 0.091 is their value in Figures 6-10).
The point about these Figures is the cross over of the curves. Thus, for these countries,
fragmentation reduces specialization when trade costs are relatively high, and increases it when
trade costs are low. Similarly for the volume of trade, the interval in which fragmentation is
associated with market-oriented investments is one in which fragmentation reduces trade
volumes. The intuition for the fact that the Herfindahl index can be less with fragmentation lies
in the fact that these countries have somewhat more extreme endowments than ideal for
specializing in X or Y, yet not extreme endowments best suited to specializing in C or A.
Without fragmentation, they do specialize in X or Y, but with fragmentation those countries
generally specialize in C,Y and Y,A respectively. Their volume of trade may be smaller with
fragmentation for reasons noted earlier. With moderate trade costs, the capital-abundant
countries would like to just export C rather than integrated X, and the labor-abundant countries

23
would like to just import components rather than integrated X. Instead of being forced to
import/export all of X, they exercise the option to just import/export that part of X (C) that they
are bad/good at.

6.

Summary and Conclusions

We develop a multi-country model of trade in which countries differ in both factor endowments
and trade costs. The ingredients are simple enough to allow intuitions from standard factor
endowment trade theory to be applied, yet the setting general enough to allow a richer range of
outcomes to occur and a richer range of questions to be addressed.
A principal issue to which we apply the model is the effect of allowing one production
sector (X) to fragment into two geographically separated production activities (C and A). Here is
an outline of our main findings.
(1) The effect of fragmentation is to produce a pattern of production that is systematically
and intuitively related to the factor intensities of the activities and the factor endowments of the
countries. A Herfindahl index of specialization confirms our intuition that fragmentation should
lead to more specialization in the world economy.
(2) Introducing fragmentation improves the welfare of most countries and for the world as
a whole. However, some countries lose. These are countries that are ideally suited to
specializing in integrated X production initially, but less suited to either C or A individually.
Fragmentation in the world economy leads to efficiency gains that translates into a fall in the
relative price of X. The countries that lose suffer a terms-of-trade deterioration on their initial
export good.

24
(3) Fragmentation enables low trade cost countries to specialize in export activities that
match their factor endowments, while higher trade cost countries use fragmentation as a means of
‘import substituting’. Thus, labor abundant countries that have low trade trade costs import
components and export assembled products, while countries with higher trade costs import
components and assemble just for the local market. In the latter case fragmentation may actually
reduce trade volumes. These cases relate closely to the results in the literature on multinational
firms that make the distinction between horizontal (market-oriented) and vertical (exportplatform) investments. Our approach also captures the difference between import-substituting
and export- oriented development strategies.
(4) Reducing trade costs worldwide moves some countries from one pattern of
specialisation to another and draws additional countries out of autarky. In particular, final
assembly activities move from a set of labor scarce countries to labor abundant ones, with
impacts on the real income and factor prices of these countries. The volume of world trade is
convex in trade cost reductions. in line with recent experience and empirical findings. As in Yi
(2003), trade expands at the extensive margin as more things are traded by existing traders but in
our case also due to more countries being drawn out of autarky and into trade. The latter allows
us to produce the convexity result even without fragmentation.
(5) Not withstanding our results that a world wide fall in trade costs increase trade volume
and specialization for the world as a whole more with fragmentation than without, there are
substantial subsets of countries for which this is not true, at least over certain ranges in trade
costs. Countries with moderate trade costs and factor endowments that differ moderately from
the world average, may take advantage of fragmentation to “unbundle” their production and trade.

25
As noted in point (3), labor-abundant countries can import just components for local assembly
instead of importing finished X (exporting Y), and capital-abundant countries can export just C
and assemble at home (importing Y).

Appendix 2: Analytical expressions for the boundaries in Figure 6: production regimes with no fragmentation
We begin by characterizing the boundary between the region where a country is diversified and the
region where it is specialized in X. For simplicity of notation, we will drop the country subscript and
reintroduce it at the end. Similarly, prices in what follows will always denote world prices at the central
market. At this boundary, zero profit conditions hold for both industries.
(1)
where 8X < 8Y, our assumption that Y is labor intensive and X is capital intensive. Second, since all
production in X, factor prices are given by the value of the marginal products of labor and capital in X,
evaluated at factor quantities equal to total national endowments, K and L.
(2)
Divide the first equation in (1) by the second equation.
(3)
Divide the first equation in (2) by the second equation.
(4)
Substitute (4) into (3)
or

(5)

This is the negatively sloped boundary on the left of Figure 6 between diversification and specialization in X
(higher K/L ratios are a movement to the left on the horizontal axis).
By an analogous procedure, the boundary between diversification and specialization in Y is given by:
(6)

In order to solve for the autarky boundaries in Figure 6, we need information on demand. We have
assumed that preferences are characterized by equal expenditure share on X and Y, so we can characterize the
fact that the country is indifferent to trade as equality between X and Y expenditures at domestic prices.
Consider first the left-hand autarky boundary of indifference between autarky and exporting X. The domestic

31
price of X is then the export price and the domestic price is Y is the import price.
(7)
The wage rate in the economy is given by the (equal) values of the marginal product of labor in X and Y.
(8)

Divide the right-hand equation in (7) by the right-hand equation in (8).
which simplifies to

(9)

At this point we can impose our symmetry assumptions between the sectors in order to simplify the algebra a
bit, so 8X + 8Y = 1. Following a similar procedure, the other four input quantities are then:
(10)
Equation (8) then becomes:
(11)
Rearranging, this becomes:
(12)

Rearranging to make this comparable to (5) and (6), the locus between autarky and exporting X is give by:

and correspondingly

(13)

is the locus between autarky and exporting Y in Figure 6. Note in free trade (t = 1), that K/L = 1 satisfies both
equations. Finally, in comparison to (5) and (6), note that the autarky boundaries lie inside/above the
diversification boundaries as shown in Figure 6.
