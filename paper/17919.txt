Indirect Tax Initiatives and Global Rebalancing
Chunding Li and John Whalley
NBER Working Paper No. 17919
March 2012
JEL No. F10,F32,F47,H20
ABSTRACT
This paper discusses how joint cross country indirect tax initiatives can be used to achieve global rebalancing.
This is potentially an important development for G20 discussions which thus far have centered on
exchange rates as the instruments to achieve rebalancing. We suggest that if China and Germany (as
major surplus countries) switch their present VAT systems from a destination principle to an origin
principle, and the US (as the major deficit country) adopts a VAT on a destination principle VAT,
jointly these actions can significantly reduce the three countries’ joint imbalances and so contribute
to global rebalancing. We use a numerical general equilibrium model with a monetary structure incorporating
inside money to capture endogeneity of trade imbalances, and to also investigate the potential impacts
of such initiatives. These confirm that VAT structures are not only good for global rebalancing but
also the changes we consider are beneficial for welfare and revenue collection. Our research is aimed
to inject new ideas to the present global rebalancing debate.

1. Introduction
This paper both sets out a potential non exchange rate based global policy
initiative involving indirect tax arrangements in the world’s three largest economies
(US, Germany and China), and, using general equilibrium techniques, evaluates its
potential impact on imbalances both globally and for individual countries. The
discussion in this paper is relevant both for current G20 discussions of global
rebalancing and also general equilibrium modeling since we use a modeling
framework in which the external sector imbalance for each country modeled is
endogenously determined rather than being zero or equal to some fixed exogenous
amount as is more commonly done.
Following the 2008 financial crisis and the establishment of the G20 in October
2008, successive G20 meetings and declarations have among other things declared the
belief of G20 heads of state that global imbalances were a primary contributory factor
to the crisis, and that efforts were needed to reduce imbalances. These imbalances
were seen as trade and current account imbalances, sharp differences in savings rates
across countries, and public sector deficits and debt levels. More concretely, in
Pittsburgh in September 2009 the G20 committed themselves to a Framework For
Strong, Sustainable, and Balanced Growth in which both external sector deficit and
surplus countries committed to broad ranging efforts to lower their imbalances.
Since Pittsburgh the main thrust of the G20 external sector rebalancing discussion
has centered on exchange rate policies as the mechanism to achieve rebalancing. This
in turn has lead to repeated pressure on China to allow appreciation of the RMB as a
3

contribution to rebalancing.
Our point of departure is to argue that exchange rate policies are not the only
available instrument to achieve global rebalancing, and to focus on an alternative
instrument, the value added tax (VAT) and its treatment of cross border transations.
Specifically, both China and Germany (and the EU more broadly) operate destination
based value added taxes under which imports are taxed but exports leave the country
tax free. Both have large trade surpluses of about 5% of GDP. Switching to an origin
basis which taxes exports and allows imports tax free entry will, given these
significant imbalances, raise taxes and effectively also tax imbalances potentially
lowering their size. The long claimed neutrality of origin/destination basis switches
for the VAT (see Krauss and Johnson, 1974; Grossman, 1980; Whalley, 1979; Genser,
1996) only holds for balanced trade, and not for today’s world. In the US there is no
VAT, but revenue pressures given the debt and deficit situation could in the next few
years potentially result in its adoption. Were this to happen, given the large US trade
deficit a VAT in the US introduced on a destination basis could similarly serve to
reduce the US imbalance. We also suggest that an internationally coordinated indirect
tax change involving China and Germany switching to an origin based VAT, and the
US introducing a destination based VAT could potentially lead to a significant change
in global external sector rebalancing.
Having set out this possible initiative, we then turn to an evaluation of the
potential rebalancing impact using general equilibrium modeling techniques (see
Shoven and Whalley, 1972). We use a conventional Armington multi-country
4

multi-product single period trade model (see Whalley, 1985), in which an analytical
novelty is to allow the trade imbalance for each country to be endogeneously
determined. We do this by incorporating into the model both current consumption and
expected future incremental consumption from savings using an analytical structure
attributed to Patinkin (1947) and also adopted in Archibald and Lipsey (1960) and
more recently in Whalley et al (2011). In an N good model, we allow preferences to
be defined over both N current consumption goods and also 1 argument representing
expected future incremental consumption from current period savings. We then use a
particular functional form that allows some countries to be savers and others
borrowers, and in the Armington trade structure this allows for endogenous
determination of trade imbalances. This structure differs from an alternation
endogenous trade imbalance simulation for China recently used by Li and Whalley
(2011), which does not fit for the US and Germany.
We calibrate this model to 2010 data on consumption, production, and trade,
involving goods in each country and use immobile capital and labor as factor inputs.
In our calculations we incorporate existing indirect tax structures by country (none
federally in the US, and destination basis VATs in Germany and China). We then
analyze counterfactuals involving the US adopting a destination based VAT, and
China and Germany adopting an origin based VAT, and assess the impacts on
imbalances. For a combined three country tax change, imbalances fall significantly,
by between 7.3% and 15.9% under different US VAT rates in our central case analysis.
We then consider cases where these 3 countries change tax structures separately, and
5

with different key parameter specifications (elasticity and the size of the upper bound
in the inside money formulation). Impacts on imbalances are again significant.
The implication of our analysis are that mechanisms beyond exchange rates can
be used to achieve either global or country rebalancing, and one such potential
mechanism is lies in the indirect tax area.

2. VATs, VAT Bases and Trade, and Rebalancing
The “value added” embodied in a product is reflected in the difference between
the sale price charged to a customer, and the cost of materials and other taxable inputs.
A manufacturer remits to the government the tax rate multiplied by the difference
between these two amounts, but retains taxes they had previously paid on inputs. A
VAT is like a sales tax in that ultimately only the end consumer is taxed, but differs
from a sales tax in that, with the latter, the tax is collected and remitted to the
government only once, at the point of purchase by the end consumer. With the VAT,
remittances to the government, net of credits for taxes already paid are made every
time a business in the supply chain sells its products; a multistage rather than a single
stage tax.
A VAT system typically uses one of two bases in its treatment of international
trade; the destination principle and the origin principle. The destination principle
implies that taxes are levied where the products are consumed for both final
consumers and producers. Exports are exempt with refund of input taxes (that is, free
of VAT) and imports are taxed on the same basis and with the same rates as locally
produced goods. This implies that the tax paid is determined by the tax laws in the
country of consumption and revenues accrue to the same country. The origin principle
implies that goods are taxed where produced, regardless of where they are consumed.
This means that exporting countries tax exports on the same basis and at the same rate
as domestic supplies, while importing countries apply no VAT on imports.
In summary, under a destination principle imports are taxed while exports are not
7

taxed. Under the origin principle, exports are taxed while imports are not. In the case
of balanced trade, moving between these tax bases has no effect on trade flows since
it can be finally accommodated by exchange rate or wage rate changes. In the case
where, however, the trade balance is non zero and where trade is unbalanced the
destination principle can promote exports more than imports. The result is a larger
trade surplus or smaller trade deficit than would occur under an origin basis.
From the view of rebalancing, if a country has a trade surplus, an origin principle
in that country for the VAT will help to reduce its surplus and increase revenues; and a
destination principle VAT decease deficit and increase revenues if the country has a

Figure 1 provides data on trade imbalance countries’ in terms of the surplus or
deficit of major global trading countries from 2001 to 2010. The US is main trade
deficit country; China, Germany and Japan are the main trade surplus countries in the
world. Global trade imbalances worsened rapidly after 2001. The financial crisis in
2008/2009 relaxed the imbalance situation, but it worsened again in 2010. The
8

Japanese trade surplus decreased in the last decade and now its imbalance is not
severe.
After the financial crisis in 2008, global economic recovery and rebalancing
became an important topic of debate. Most debate focused on exchange rate
adjustments to rebalance global trade. We develop the idea that exchange rate
adjustment is not the only path to realizing rebalancing. VAT regime switching can
also have impacts on rebalancing. China and Germany currently use a destination
principle VAT, and the US has no VAT. Thus if China and Germany were to switch
their VAT regime from a destination principle to an origin principle, and the US
adopted a VAT (which they currently do not have) with an origin principle VAT, the
total imbalance can be reduced with increased revenues for each country (or reduced
tax rates) which also may increase each country’s welfare.

3. Endogenous Trade Imbalance Model Description
We use a four country general equilibrium model with international trade in
goods to which monetary structure using inside money is added following Whalley et
al (2011). This allows for the endogenous determination of trade imbalances for trade
in goods, which is offset through inter-temporal trade across countries in money. The
monetary structure builds on Azariadis (1993) where there is extensive discussion of
simple overlapping generation models with inside money. In analyzing trade
interactions between monetary structure and commodity trade are needed, and hence
models with simultaneous inter-temporal and inter-commodity structure.
In our general equilibrium model with monetary structure, we assume there are
two goods in each period and allow inter-commodity trade to co-exist within the
period along with trade in debt in the form of inside money. We use a single period
model where either claims on future consumption (money holding) or future
consumption liabilities (money insuance) enter the utility function as incremental
future consumption from current period savings. This is the formulation of inside
money used by Patinkin (1947, 1971) and Archibald and Lipsey (1960). This can also
be used in a multi-country model structure with trade in both goods and inside money.
The general equilibrium model has four countries, and each country produces two
goods with two factors. These four countries are China, US, Germany and the rest of
the world (ROW), all trade imbalance countries in the global economy. The two goods
are tradable goods and non-tradable goods. The two factors are labor and capital.
On the consumption side, we use the Armington assumption of product
10

heterogeneity across countries, and assume claims on future consumption enter
preferences and are traded between countries. Each country can thus either issue or
buy claims on future consumption using current period income. We use a nested CES
utility function to capture consumption

If these countries in our model adopt a VAT, each country will receive revenues
denoted as Ri . We assume country i ' s capital and labor endowment are K i and

(9)

Budget constraints apply for each country i as
Pi T X iT  pciNT X iNT  pciY Yi  I i

(10)

Here, inside money Yi also represents country i ' s trade imbalance. Yi  0 implies
a trade surplus (or claims on future consumption); Yi  0 implies a trade deficit or
future consumption liabilities (money issuance), and Yi  0 implies trade balance.
For trade deficit countries, utility will decrease in inside money since they are
issuers. In order to capture this, we use an upper bound Y 0 in the utility function in a
term [ Y 0  Yi ] following Whalley et al (2011) and assume that Y 0 is large enough to
ensure that Y 0  Yi  0 . We use the transformation yi  Y 0  Yi to solve the

base case equilibrium data set and simulate counter factual cases where China and
Germany switch their present destination principle VAT regime to an origin principle
regime and the US adopt a destination basis VAT.

4. Data and Parameters Calibration
We use 2010 as our base year in building a benchmark general equilibrium
dataset for use in calibration and counterfactual simulation (Shoven and Whalley,
1992). There are four countries China, US, Germany and ROW in our model, and
ROW data is obtained by using total world value minus values for China, US and
Germany. For the two tradable goods and non-tradable goods, we assume secondary
industry (manufacturing) reflects tradable goods, and primary and tertiary industry
(agriculture, extractive industries, and services) yield non-tradable goods. For the two
factor inputs, capital and labor, we use total labor income (wages) to denote labor
values for inputs by sector, but not labor amount. All data are in billions of US dollars.
We adjust some of the data values for mutual consistency for calibration purposes.
The data we use in model calibration as the base case equilibrium are displayed
in Tables 1 and 2. Chinese data are from China data online. We use production and
capital values to determine labor values by residual for China. US data are from the
Statistics Database of Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), capital and labor are from
the input-output table. German data are from OECD statistics and the database of
Germany Federal Statistical Office (www.destatis.de). Total World data are from the
World Economic Outlook (WEO) database of IMF, and World Development
Indicators (WDI) of World Bank. From the total world data we can calculate ROW
data as a residual.
Trade data between each country are from the UN interactive graphic system of
international economic trends (SIGCI Plus) database (Table 2). We use total export
16

and import values for China, US and Germany to calculate these countries’ exports
and imports with the ROW. From production and trade data, we can then determine
each country’s consumption value. The VAT rates are from Wikipedia
(http://en.wikipedia.org) information data. Inside Money is given by each country’s
trade imbalance and calculated from trade data in Table 2. Endowment data are
calculated from factor input data.

We choose the upper bound Y value to equal 1000 in all countries. We change

this value in later sensitivity analysis to check its influence on counterfactual
simulation results. There are no available estimates of elasticities for each country on
the demand and production side for the elasticities in our CES production and
consumption functions. Many of the estimates of domestic and import good
substitution elasticity are around 2 (Betina et al, 2006), so we set all of these
elasticities in our model to 2 (Whalley and Wang, 2010). We change these elasticities
later to check their sensitivity influence on simulation results.
Table 3 reports the model parameters generated by calibration. When used in
model solution these will regenerate the benchmark data as an equilibrium for the
model. Then, using these parameters we simulate the effects of Chinese and German
VAT regime changes from the destination principle to an origin principle and US
adopting an origin principle VAT system.

5. Simulation Results
We next perform counter factual simulations and report their results. Following
the discussion above, we explore the effects of Chinese and German VAT regime
switching from the present destination principle to an origin principle, and of US
adopting a destination principle VAT. We assess VAT switching effects on imbalances,
production, welfare and revenue both from the whole world and individual countries.
We generate results for four different scenarios. The first is where China, US and
Germany make changes simultaneously, that is China and Germany switch to an
origin principle VAT and US adopt a destination principle VAT. The second is US
separately adopting a destination principle VAT. The third is China’s single switch to
an origin principle VAT. The last is Germany’s single switching to an origin principle
VAT. China and Germany currently have a destination principle VAT and we assume
they use an equal tax rate switching method, which means they keep their present
VAT rates; just switching the VAT basis. This raises revenues. The switch could be
analyzed on an equal yield basis which lowers rates. In US, there is no VAT system
used at present, and we alternatively assume its VAT rate is set at 5%, 10%, 15% and
20% in four separate cases. Since imbalances (total export minus total import) can be
negative in some countries, we add all four countries’ absolute value of imbalances; to
yield the total world imbalance.
5.1 Simultaneous VAT Changes in All Three Countries

We first consider the case where China and Germany switch their destination
principle VAT to an origin basis and the US adopts a destination principle VAT. We
19

compare outcomes to the base case equilibrium to get results. We assume the US VAT
rate is 5%, 10%, 15% and 20% alternatively. Table 4 and Figure 3 report the results.

On the imbalance side, we find that China, US, Germany and the total for the
world show a decrease; only the ROW has an increase. These results thus suggest that
simultaneous VAT changes can reduce both all individual countries’ and the global
trade imbalance, and hence contribute to global rebalancing. Compared with the base
case data, total world imbalances separately decrease by 7.3%, 10.9%, 13.3% and
15.9% when the US VAT rate used is 5%, 10%, 15% and 20%. For China, its
imbalance decreases are larger the higher the US VAT rate, with changes of between
-6.6% and -8.1%. For the US, its imbalance changes increase as its VAT rate increases,
with changes of between -7.3% and -19.2%. For Germany, its imbalance reduces
substantially after the changes, decreasing from between 95.7% to 111.1% and
20

moving into a deficit. The reason for this is that Germany is a highly trade dependent
country (Figure 4) and its existing VAT rate is high (19%). Its degree of dependence
on trade is 76.1% in 2010 in our base case data, much higher than China (50.1%), US
(22.3%) and the ROW(18.8%). For the ROW, imbalances will be improved after
switching because of trade diversion effects.

On the production side, changes for the world total and most individual countries
are negative, because the VAT regime change increases trade prices and hurts trade
between these countries and reduces their total production. The reduction is, however,
small. On the welfare side, China and Germany benefit from these changes. Their
welfare increases by 2%-3%; US welfare falls by about -0.76% and -0.83% when US
VAT rates are 5% and 20%, because of reduced consumption. Total world welfare
improves by between 0.176% and 0.218% after these changes. On the revenue side,
all countries gain, and especially so the US. If US uses a 5% destination principle VAT,
its revenue will increase 761.4 billion US$; a 10% destination principle VAT will
collect 1514.1 billion US$ and a 20% destination principle VAT will collect 3001.9
billion US$. These revenues could offset the present US government deficit.
We have also performed sensitivity analysis for the above simulation results. We
change elasticities in production and consumption to separately equal 0.6, 1.6 and 2.6,
and change the upper bound for Y 0 to 2000, 3000 and 4000. We then recalibrate
parameters and simulate simultaneously VAT change effects. Here we check the
sensitivity for cases where the US VAT rate equals 15%. These results are reported in
Table 5. We find that results do not change much compared with base model
simulation results. Most changes are increasing in elasticities, and increase as the
upper bound inside money value increase.
In general, if China and Germany switch their VAT system from the present
destination principle to an origin principle and the US adopts a destination principle
VAT, the combined effect is to reduce imbalances for the whole world and also for all
22

these three individual countries so that it is good for global rebalancing. These
changes also improve China’s and Germany’s welfare and increases all three
countries’ revenue.

5.2 US Single Switching to Take A Destination Principle VAT

We also simulate the effects of a US single adoption of a destination principle
VAT. We again examine cases where the US VAT rate separately equals 5%, 10%,
15% and 20%. Results are presented in Table 6 and Figure 5.
These results show that the world total and all individual country’s imbalance
23

will decrease. If US VAT rate equals 10%, the whole world total imbalance will
decrease 7.47%, and China, US, Germany and the ROW will separately reduce their
imbalance by 0.87%, 7.47%, 11.22% and 8.91%. Hence, if US adopts a destination
principle VAT, it can not only reduce its own trade imbalance, but also benefit global
rebalancing.
US production shows no change but its welfare and revenue will increase.
China’s welfare and revenue both increase and production shows nearly no change.
Germany’s welfare and revenue will increase, but its production decreases a little.
World welfare and revenue increase and production declines.

We can again change elasticity values and the upper bound on inside money Y 0

These analyses reveal that the US adopting a destination principle VAT is good
for global rebalancing. In the meanwhile, it can increase global total and individual
countries’ welfare and increase their revenues. These effects are especially significant
for the US.
5.3 China Single Switching VAT from Destination to Origin Principle

We also report results for China alone switching its VAT system from a
destination principle to an origin principle. We focus on the influence on imbalances,
production, welfare and revenue. Table 8 and Figure 6 show these results.
As for effects on China, its imbalance decreases by 15.28%, welfare increases by
5.20%, revenue increases by 3.86% and total production decreases by about 0.005%.
So China’s VAT system switching benefits China not only on the trade balance but
also in terms of welfare and revenue.
As for the influence on the US and Germany, both of their imbalances increases,
production decreases and welfare increases. The increase in the US’s imbalance is
because of China’s improved export price through VAT increases on import value, and
US importing more from Germany with a higher price compared to China. This
suggests that the large US trade imbalance is mainly caused by high US consumption.
26

Germany’s increased imbalance is caused by trade diversion from China. Although
China’s switching deteriorates both the US and Germany imbalance it improves their
welfare. For the world, the trade imbalance increases by 1.54%, total production
decreases by 0.0084% and welfare increases by 0.013%.

We perform sensitivity analysis on the above results by change elasticity values
and upper bound inside money values. Table 9 gives the results. We find that as
elasticities increase, China’s imbalance will reduce more and more. The US imbalance
changes from an increase to a decrease (when  =2.6, US imbalance will decrease
0.28%), the German imbalance changes from an increase to a decrease as well (when
27

 =2.6, Germany imbalance will decrease 27.23%). As upper bound inside money
increases, China imbalance further decreases (when Y 0 =4000, its imbalance
decreases by 29.5%), US imbalance further increases and German imbalance changes
to a decrease of about 25%-28%. The main results do not change but are sensitive to
elasticities and the upper bound for inside money.

China’s VAT system switching effects reveal that it is also a good measure for
China. It is beneficial for China’s rebalancing and welfare. This switching also
improves total world welfare but hurts global rebalancing.

For Germany, their imbalance decreases by 63.18%, production decreases by
0.0098%, and welfare and revenue increase separately by 3.39% and 3.79%. So VAT
system switching is a good measure for Germany, and not only good for rebalancing
but also benefits welfare and revenue. For China, its imbalance increases by 2.95%
caused by trade diversion effects. Production, welfare and revenue all change
negatively. For the US, the imbalance decreases by 2.91%, production and welfare
both slightly decrease. As for the total global changes, imbalances will decrease
29

2.91%, welfare increases 0.07% and revenue increases 1.12%.

We perform sensitivity analysis by changing elasticity values and the upper
bound inside money value. Table 11 gives the results. As elasticities increase, all
change results increase, but change directions (increase or decrease) do not change.
In conclusion, Germany VAT system switching is good for Germany’s own
rebalancing and also global rebalancing, and increases world total and Germany
welfare.

6. Conclusions
We use a general equilibrium model with monetary structure incorporating inside
money to yield an endogenously determined trade surplus, and numerically calibrate it
to 2010 data in a 4 country single period global general equilibrium model covering
the US, Germany, China, and the Rest of the World. We use it to capture the effects of
VAT regime changes (and adoption in the US) on global imbalances; an important
issue in current G20 discussions. We simulate four different scenarios to explore the
contribution of these VAT changes to global and individual country rebalancing.
These are: (1) China and Germany switching their present VAT system from a
destination principle to an origin principle, and the US adopting a destination
principle VAT; (2) the US individually adopting a destination principle VAT; (3) China
individually switching to from a destination to an origin principle VAT; and (4)
Germany individually switching to an origin principle VAT.
Our simulations results suggest that any individual country’s VAT changes will
significantly reduce world total and individual country’s imbalances, improve
individual country’s welfare and increase revenues. The three countries’ jointly
making these VAT changes can significantly reduce global imbalances and improve
world welfare and most individual country’s welfare. In general, global imbalances
will be reduced most if China and Germany can switch their VATs from their present
destination principle to an origin principle and the US adopts a destination principle
VAT. Additionally, each country’s utility will be increased, and total revenue will
increase which can help with government budget deficits.
31

Reducing global imbalances is one of main tasks in current G20 discussions.
Most present discussions are of exchange rate changes, which will produce pressure
on individual countries for exchange rate adjustments which may hurt growth and
increase unemployment. Our analyses suggest that indirect tax initiatives such as VAT
principle switching can be an effective alternative measure for achieving global
rebalancing.
