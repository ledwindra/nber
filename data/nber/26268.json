    "abstract": "\n\nEnvironmental markets are widely prescribed as an alternative to open-access regimes for natural resources. We develop a model of dynamic groundwater extraction to demonstrate how a spatial regression discontinuity design that exploits a spatially-incomplete market for groundwater rights recovers a lower bound on the market\u2019s net bene\ufb01t. We apply this estimator to a major aquifer in water-scarce southern California and \ufb01nd that a groundwater market generated substantial net bene\ufb01ts, as capitalized in land values. Heterogeneity analyses point to gains arising in part from rights trading, enabling more e\ufb03cient water use across sectors. Additional \ufb01ndings suggest the market increased groundwater levels.\n\n",
