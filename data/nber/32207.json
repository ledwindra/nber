    "abstract": "\n\nForestation is viewed as an important means of removing CO\u2082 from the atmosphere and thereby reducing net CO\u2082 emissions. But how much CO\u2082 can be removed, and at what cost? Focusing on forested and forestable areas in South America, and using spatially disaggregated data, we estimate a supply curve for forest-based atmospheric CO\u2082 removal. The supply curve traces out the marginal cost of removing a metric ton of CO\u2082 as a function of total annual CO\u2082 removal. Each point on the curve corresponds to a specific location, and accounts for land opportunity costs as well as costs of tree planting and maintenance. We show that over a billion tons of CO\u2082 can be removed annually via forestation at a cost below $45 per ton, and about 2.5 billion tons can be removed at a cost below $90 per ton. The supply curve applies to only South America, but with sufficient data could be extended to the entire world.\n\n",
