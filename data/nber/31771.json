    "abstract": "\n\nIndividuals might experience negative utility from not consuming a popular product. With such externalities to non-users, standard consumer surplus measures, which take aggregate consumption as given, fail to appropriately capture consumer welfare. We propose an approach to account for these externalities and apply it to estimate consumer welfare from two social media platforms: TikTok and Instagram. Incentivized experiments with college students indicate positive welfare based on the standard measure, but negative welfare when accounting for these non-user externalities. Our findings highlight the existence of product market traps, where large shares of active users prefer each platform not to exist.\n\n",
