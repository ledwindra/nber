Sweden's Fiscal Framework and Monetary Policy
Eric M. Leeper
NBER Working Paper No. 24743
June 2018
JEL No. E31,E52,E62
ABSTRACT
Basic economic reasoning tells us that monetary and fiscal policies always interact to jointly
determine aggregate demand and the overall level of prices in the economy. This paper interprets
Sweden's explicit monetary and fiscal frameworks in light of this reasoning, bringing recent
Swedish inflation and interest-rate developments to bear on the interpretations. Theory and
evidence raise the question of whether the two policy frameworks are mutually consistent.

to assessment, whi h is one goal of this arti le. I raise the possibility that the poli y rule
that Swedish s al authorities follow, parti ularly in re ent years, may be at odds with the
Riksbank's primary goal of targeting ination.

level of government debt.

2.1

Poli y Regimes

Table 1 summarizes the poli y mixes that determine ination and stabilize debt. To make
the arguments

lear, I make stark and unrealisti

assumptions about poli y behavior. The

arguments go through with more plausible assumptions.
The rst regime ree ts the

onventional view that monetary poli y a tively adjusts

the poli y interest rate to lean against ination, while s al poli y passively adjusts primary
budget surplusesrevenues less expenditures, not in luding interest payments on government
debtto stabilize the long-run debt-GDP ratio. Taylor's famous rule falls into this regime:
the

entral bank raises the poli y interest rate more than one-for-one with the ination rate

and raises the interest rate more modestly when the output gap in reases [Taylor (1993)℄.

4

Be ause monetary poli y fo uses on stabilizing ination and the real e onomy, s al poli y
must ensure that government debt remains well behaved. When s al poli y makes taxes
rise with the level of real government debtnominal debt deated by the pri e levelby
more than enough to

over interest payments and some of the prin ipal, the debt-GDP ratio

will be stable in the long run. Many e onomists believe this regime prevails during normal

At a general level, there is nothing good or bad about the two poli y regimes. Re ent
resear h on jointly optimal monetary and s al poli ies nds that the best mix of poli ies in
terms of so ial welfare has elements of both the

onventional and the alternative views [Sims

(2013) and Leeper and Zhou (2013)℄. Both regimes deliver the broad ma roe onomi

goals of determining ination and stabilizing government debt. But be ause monetary and
s al a tions have dierent impa ts in the two regimes, it is essential for poli ymakers to
know in whi h regime the e onomy resides.
Be ause U.S. monetary poli y behavior was been widely studied, I will point out several

must

ertain well-spe ied ways. It is not possible for monetary and s al poli y to

operate independently of ea h other and still deliver good e onomi

performan e. Under-

standing the nature of these intera tions is essential to formulating ee tive poli y rules.
Monetary poli y a tions always have s al

onsequen es.

8

Let's start with something

routine: the Riksbank lowers the repo rate in order to raise ination. This isn't the end of
the story: a lower repo rate tends to lower all interest rates, in luding those on government
debt, so interest payments on outstanding debt de line.
Now s al poli y

omes into play. Those lower interest payments redu e s al needs. To

ensure that government debt is stable, taxes must be lower or expenditures must be higher in
the future to oset the redu ed debt servi e. Without these s al adjustments, government
debt would steadily fall, eventually making the government a net lender to the private se tor.
But there is a tually more to the s al response than simply stabilizing debt.

Lower

interest payments on government bonds redu e the wealth of holders of those bonds. If those
lower interest re eipts do not trigger an expe tation of eventually lower taxes to

ompensate

for the redu ed wealth, lower wealth will lead to redu ed demand for goods and servi es
lower aggregate demandand a lower pri e level.
Be ause the Riksbank initially redu ed the repo rate in the hope of
demand and ination, the negative wealth ee t

To

support monetary poli y, s al poli y needs to provide the s al ba king that adjusts future
taxes in the opposite dire tion to pri e-level movements. A higher pri e levelthe Riksbank's
immediate goalrequires a s al rule that lowers future taxes, while a lower pri e level

for a poli y that raises taxes. Su h a rule eliminates the wealth ee ts of entral bank hanges
in interest rates to deliver the desired ee t of monetary poli y on aggregate demand.
The s al rule under the
a ademi

onventional view in table 1 both stabilizes debt and provides

literature. Indetermina y means that the ination rate is not pinned down by poli y and is subje t

to potentially volatile u tuations that arise from self-fullling expe tations of ination by the private se tor.
Woodford (2003) explains that determina y is a minimal requirement for optimal poli y.

8 Tobin (1980) and Walla e (1981) make this point.

7

Leeper: Swedish Fis al Framework

the ne essary s al ba king for monetary poli y. A rule that raises future surpluses whenever

real debt in

reases has two omponents to it. First, for a xed pri e level, higher nominal debt

brings forth higher surpluses to ensure government debt is stable. Se ond, for a xed level
of nominal debt, a lower pri e level

reates the expe tation of higher future taxes to provide

the s al ba king for monetary poli y's ination-targeting a tions. The passive poli y rule
in the table happens to deliver both desirable out omes.
The message is:

to su

essfully raise ination, the Riksbank's

(lower repo rate) ne essarily requires

looser s al poli y

looser monetary poli y

(smaller budget surpluses) at some

point. That s al response is essential for the Riksbank to be able to

ontrol ination and

fulll the pri e-stability poli y mission that the Rigsdag set out for the bank in the Sveriges
Riksbank A t.
Unfortunately, not all s al rules both stabilize debt and ba k monetary poli y. This is
why it's important for governments to move beyond adopting targets, toward des ribing the
behavior that a hieves the targets. Both out omes rely on s al expe tations. If markets
know that higher real debt eventually leads to higher stabilizing surpluses, then s al poli y
will not run into sustainability problems, as investors are assured the government will fulll
its nan ial

ommitments. This argument gures prominently in the Swedish s al poli y

framework [Swedish Government (2011), pages 5, 7, and 12, for example℄. If bondholders
know that lower taxes are sure to follow lower interest re eipts, then monetary poli y's
adverse wealth ee ts will not arise, and interest-rate poli y will ae t ination as intended.
This point is missing from the Swedish s al framework.
Appropriate s al ba king for monetary poli y is
stability. In a

riti al for the Riksbank to a hieve pri e

ountry like Sweden, with an expli it s al target, it is essential to ensure

that the s al rules used to implement the target provide appropriate ba king for monetary
poli y. A

orre tly designed rule an hors people's expe tations on the belief that s al poli y

will, in time, rea t appropriately to monetary poli y by eliminating the wealth ee ts that
monetary poli y produ es.

Roosevelt used three strategies to

onvin e the publi

that higher government debt would

not ne essitate higher future taxes. First, he made poli y depend on the state of the e onomy, saying he would run bond-nan ed de its until the e onomy re overed. Se ond, he
emphasized the temporary nature of the poli y by distinguishing between the regular budget, whi h he balan ed, and the emergen y budget, whose de its were driven by spending
designed to provide relief to those the depression had harmed. Finally, Roosevelt raised the
politi al stakes by pit hing e onomi

sevelt (1936)℄. The strategies appeared to work be ause expe ted ination began to rise by

Monetary poli y behaved passively through the re overy.

After the United States left

gold, the Fed no longer needed to keep interest rates high to staun h the outow of gold
and the New York Fed redu ed its dis ount rate to 1.5 per ent in February 1934, where it
remained until August 1937, when it was lowered to 1 per ent.

Historians like Friedman and S hwartz (1963) and Romer (1992) attribute re overy to
higher growth in the supply of money. After Ameri a left the gold standard, the Treasury
bought the gold that owed into the

ountry from a politi ally unstable Europe and paid for

that gold by dire tly expanding bank reserves and high-powered money. But that explanation
overlooks the signi ant expansion in government debt that took pla e. The dollar value of
federal debt outstanding doubled in the six years after leaving the gold standard, ree ting
the substantial s al stimulus asso iated with Roosevelt's relief programs.
Remarkably, this expansion in nominal debt did not raise the debt-GNP ratio. Figure 1
plots the par and market values of gross federal debt as per entages of GNP from 1920 to
1940. The verti al line marks departure from gold in April 1933. After bottoming out in
September 1929 at 15.6 per ent, the debt-GNP ratio rose steadily while the United States
was still on gold, rea hing 44.7 per ent in Mar h 1933. It then remained below 45 per ent
through the end of 1937. E onomi
e onomi

re overy raised both the pri e level and the real level of

a tivity, ensuring that the debt-GNP ratio was stable.

In this alternative poli y mix, the Federal Reserve behaved passively, permitting the s al
expansion to raise aggregate demand and with it, pri es and output. With this poli y mix,
there need not be any

oni t between s al expansion and s al sustainability be ause, as

the data in gure 1 neatly illustrate, the s al expansion did not in rease debt relative to
the size of the e onomy.

Switzerland has a 2 per ent ination target that has been missed hroni ally. In Switzerland,

do not seem to be the result of inadequate eorts by monetary poli y: poli y interest rates

The Swiss

When monetary poli y redu es (raises) interest rates and interest payments on government

Negative Nominal Bond Yields

Like several other European

ountries, Sweden has been going through the unusual situation

in whi h nominal government bond yields have been negative, even at horizons as long as ve
years. While there are many reasons that nominal yields have turned negativee onomi

right to lend to the government. When yields remain negative, it must

mean that the government is not taking the private se tor up on its generous oer.
Medium-term government bond yields are negative be ause demand for those safe assets
is very strong. Strong demand bids up bond pri es at the relevant maturities, driving down
yields.

If the government were to respond to the strong demand by in reasing supply of

the desirable assets, yields would rise. Negative yields, therefore, may ree t a shortage of
high-demand assets.
Although the logi

of why negative bond yields suggest suboptimal s al behavior may

be obvious, a simple numeri al example may

14

larify the issues.

14 This example omes from a onversation with Jon Faust.

13

Suppose that in 2017, the

Leeper: Swedish Fis al Framework

market pri e of a government bond that pays SEK 100 in 2018 is SEK 105, implying a

−5

per ent annual yield. For the sake of this example, imagine that the bond is bought by the
Riksbank by

rediting the government's a

ount at the Riksbank by SEK 105, the amount

by whi h assets and liabilities of both the government and the Riksbank in rease. When the
bond

omes due in 2018, the government pays the Riksbank SEK 100, so its assets with the

entral bank de line by SEK 100, while its liabilities de line by SEK 105. The mirror of this
transa tion has the Riksbank's assets de line by SEK 105 and its liabilities by SEK 100.
The following year, the government transfers SEK 5 to the private se tor, paid for by
rediting banks' deposits at the Riksbank by SEK 5. Government balan es with the Riksbank
fall by SEK 5; liabilities of the Riksbank de line by those 5 krona and rise by the equivalent

How a Net-Lending Target Works and Why It's Fragile

Swedish s al poli y pursues a net-lending target that is

urrently one per ent of GDP

over the medium term. To understand that poli y's impli ations for government debt developments, we need to study how government debt evolves over time. Government debt's
evolution is governed by the government's budget identity, whi h may be written as

Qt Bt = (1 + ρQt )Bt−1 − St

15

Leeper: Swedish Fis al Framework

where

Bt

is the nominal value of the government's bond portfolio,

of the portfolio, and

St

Qt

is the nominal pri e

is the nominal primary budget surplus. The primary surplus is the

dieren e between total tax revenues and total government expenditures, ex luding interest
payments on outstanding debt. As written, the budget identity assumes that all government
bonds are in nominal krona. In fa t, Sweden also issues ination-linked bonds and foreign
urren y bonds, but in 2017 over half of Swedish government debt was krona denominated.
We spe ialize the spe i ation of government debt by assuming that all debt pays zero
oupons and that the maturity stru ture de ays at the

5.1

Always on Target

Initially, let's make the simplifying and extreme assumption that the government hits this

st = n∗ +

This expression is a rule for setting the surplus that makes net lending always equal to its
target.

To hit the net-lending target every period, the primary surplus must equal that

target value plus the real interest payments on debt
expression,

Rt /(1 + Gt )

arried over from the past.

In this

is the realination-adjustedrate of return on the government's

bond portfolio.
The extreme assumption produ es extreme poli y behavior: the government must adjust
the real primary surplus one-for-one with real debt servi e. This has two

to a hieve the net-lending target every period, the government loses the exibility to pursue

stabilization, in ome distribution, and so fortheven in

the short run. For ing net lending to be always on target makes primary surpluses the exa t
fun tion of sele t e onomi

onditions that expression (3) des ribes.

Se ond, the government must rea t to any e onomi

disturban e that raises debt servi e

by raising the primary surplus. If the Riksbank redu es the repo rate in order to stimulate
ination, for example, then at least initially real interest rates are likely to fall at all maturities. This redu es the real return on outstanding debt and, hen e, debt servi e

and passive s al ba king for monetary poli y. The s al behavior that (3) des ribes delivers
both the lending target and the s al ba king.

5.2

Gradually on Target

Neither the Swedish government, nor any government, aims to keep net lending on target
all the time. Instead, the target is intended to be hit on average over the
y les. We

ourse of e onomi

an generalize this analysis by allowing the adjustment to the net-lending target

to be gradual. One s al rule that gradually a hieves the net-lending target is

st − s̄ = −γ(nt − n∗ ),
where

s̄

γ>0

(4)

is the long-run primary surplus-GDP level. By this rule, whenever net lending is

above target,

nt > n∗ ,

the government makes the primary surplus lower than its long-run

value. A lower surplus redu es net lending (or in reases government borrowing) to redu e net
lending ba k to target over time. The rule in (4) is a stylized des ription of s al behavior.
E onomi

theory often posits stylized behavior in order to fo us attention on a single aspe t

of what poli y doesin this
be far more

ase, how surpluses rea t to net lending. A rule like (4)

make the analysis more

For this net-lending rule to stabilize government debt and rea h the net-lending target in
the long run, primary surpluses must respond to net lending with su ient strength. This
implies a restri tion on the

Table 4 makes

lear how the

A

higher ination target redu es the threshold, permitting the debt-GDP ratio to be stabilized
with a weaker response of surpluses to net lending.

It might seem odd that the ination

target would have an impa t on long-run stabilization of the government debt. The reason

20

Leeper: Swedish Fis al Framework

for this is that a higher ination target produ es lower bond pri es, whi h redu e the market
value of debt as a share of GDP. A lower market value of debt, on average, makes it easier
to stabilize the ratio.
The message is that

even in the long run, monetary and s al poli ies must be onsistent

with ea h other.

Alternative Representation of Fis al Rule

We

an derive an alternative representation of the s al behavior that underlies the net-

lending target. This representation ties more

losely to theoreti al work on how monetary

sets the primary surplus in response to net interest payments

Whereas in (3) the

Now the government sets poli y to raise the primary surplus whenever the

If the

hange in debt target is positive and it is su

essfully a hieved, then debt is growing

debt is de lining as a share of the e onomy. In either

ase, debt is not a stable fra tion of

GDP.
The only dieren e between a negative

hange in debt target and a net-lending target is

that net lending s ales past debt by the growth rate of nominal GDP. Of

ourse, in periods

when nominal GDP growth is small, positive net lending is essentially equivalent to a negative
hange in debt.

5.5

What These Fis al Rules Aim to A

omplish

Countries adopt s al rules, not be ause the rules

per se

are virtuous, but be ause the

rules help to a hieve some broader obje tives. Those broader obje tives, a

ording to the

Swedish s al poli y framework, are to use s al poli y to raise the welfare of Swedish
itizens through e onomi

growth, redistribution of in ome, and stabilization of the ma ro

e onomy. As the framework words it, A fundamental pre ondition for being able to attain
the overall obje tive of s al poli y is the long-term sustainability of the publi

[Swedish Government (2011, p. 5)℄. One way to operationalize long-term sustainability is
the a hievement of a stable debt-GDP ratio over the long run.
Many years ago Phillips (1954) applied the theory of

ontrol to

ategorize three types of

poli y rules: proportional, integral, and derivative. He argued that the main driver of poli y
needs to be a proportional rule. The behavior that equation (4) des ribes makes deviations
of the primary surplus from its long-run value proportional to deviations of net lending from
target. One

At the same time that debt has de lined in re ent

years, many nominal bond yields have been negative, as se tion 4 do uments. As I argued
in that se tion, Swedish governments have de lined the bond market's oer of a free lun h,
whi h presents an opportunity to raise welfare among Swedes. Perhaps this is a sign of an
overly-rigid desire to redu e government debt, regardless of prevailing e onomi

onditions.

Government bond developments in gure 5 are ree ted in net-lending data. Figure 6
plots net lending as a per entage of GDP, along with the net-lending target, whi h was 2

Some Estimates from Swedish Data

Can we nd support in Swedish data for the s al poli y a tions that underlie the net-lending
target? This se tion turns to some estimates of Swedish s al poli y behavior to address
that question.
21 By Phillips's reasoning, a proportional rule that is more stable than those underlying either the netlending or

hange-in-debt targets would simply make surpluses depend on deviations of debt from some

Estimates of Net-Lending Rule

As a rst pass at applying this theoreti al reasoning to Swedish data, I estimate versions
of the s al rule in expression (4), whi h adjusts the primary surplus to target net lending.
Table 5 reports estimates of s al behavior using quarterly data from 1993 through the rst
half of 2017.
These estimates do not lend support to the hypothesis that Swedish s al poli y adjusts
primary surpluses to target net lending, as s al rule (4) posits.

24

Negative values of the

Leeper: Swedish Fis al Framework

thresholds in table 3 give the minimum response of surpluses to net lendingthe

γ

oe ient

To return net lending to target, surpluses

must move in the opposite dire tion of net lending's deviation from target: if net lending is
too high, surpluses must be redu ed. Taken at fa e value, the estimates in the rst three
olumns of table 5 report that when net lending is high, the government raises surpluses.
This rea tion does not appear to be

onsistent with a net-lending target be ause it makes net

lending in rease to deviate farther from target. This pattern holds in both the ordinary least
squares and the instrumental variables panels. The instrumental variables estimates aim to
address the fa t that the ordinary least squares estimates are

ontaminated by the naturally

positive relationship between net lending and the primary surplus that the government's
budget identity delivers.
The fourth

olumns in the two panels seem more promising. That spe i ation alters

s al rule (4) by making surpluses rea t to lags in both net lending and in surpluses, a
spe i ation that smooths the s al response over time. Although the

oe ient on lagged

net lending is negative, as stabilizing behavior requires, it is not statisti ally dierent from
0. The long-run response of surpluses to net lending takes a

ount of how

urrent surpluses

depend on past surpluses, a dependen e that raises the response well above the estimate of
0.107 reported as the

oe ient on lagged net lending. But be ause that

statisti ally signi ant, it is di ult to

on lude there is strong eviden e that s al poli y

follows the net-lending rule in equation (4).
The fourth

22

olumn of the instrumental variables panel reports a somewhat more sig-

oe ient on lagged net lending. Unfortunately, the estimate on lagged surpluses

implies that the equation is not stable, with surpluses exploding over time. This e onomially nonsensi al estimate makes it hard to take the equation seriously as a des ription of
s al poli y behavior.
An important short oming of the regressions that table 5 reports is that they do not
indi ate how primary surpluses and net lending intera t dynami ally. Although the simple
theory above makes surpluses respond immediately to higher net lending, in pra ti e there
is no reason to expe t su h instantaneous rea tion.

entral theme of the monetary-s al poli y intera tions that se tion 2 lays out is that for

Whenever monetary poli y a tions raise (lower) debt servi e, s al poli y must eventually
respond by raising (lowering) primary surpluses.

This is the pattern of response that the

alternative representation of s al behavior in equation (7) ree ts. We now turn to Swedish
data to seek eviden e of this behavior.
Table 6 reports estimates of variants on equation (7), whi h depi ts how surpluses rea t

autiously.

The government's budget identity indu es a positive relationship between the primary surplus
and interest payments on the debt. To see this, write the identity in (2) as

An

in rease in demand for bonds is the mirror image of a de rease in demand for goods and
servi es. When government bonds be ome more desirable, people redu e their pur hases of
goods and servi es in order to in rease their bond holdings. That de rease in goods demand
is a de line in aggregate demand, whi h drives down the pri e level, as gure 9 depi ts.

Applying This Reasoning to Sweden

How is any of this relevant for Sweden? Se tion 4 reviewed that Swedish government bond
yields have now been negative for more than two years. At times, those negative yields have
applied to bonds that do not

ome due for ve years. Table 7 reports a variety of measures

of short-term real interest rates in Sweden over three re ent periods. Sin e January 2008,
nearly all measures have been negative on average. But over the past two and a half years,
the measures have been strongly negative, well over
over the seven years before the nan ial

−1.50 per

ent in some

ases. In

risis, real interest rates were around

ontrast,

positive 1.50

per ent. Evidently, Sweden is entren hed in a low-interest rate environment.
Low interest rates have been a worldwide phenomenon in re ent years.

But one

lear

reason that Swedish real rates have turned sharply negative is the Riksbank's poli y stan e, a

32

Leeper: Swedish Fis al Framework

stan e that in ludes negative poli y interest rates. Be ause negative real interest rates imply
real dis ount fa tors greater than 1, negative rates have important s al
onsequen es

an be understood through the lens of the debt valuation equation in (9) and

the supply-demand graph in gure 9.

Monetary poli y a tions are

pri es and the nominal value of outstanding debt rise. Figure 10 plots the pri e of government bonds (left axis) against the repo rate (right axis). The pri e of bonds is

There is a

between bond pri es and the Riksbank's poli y interest rate, just as theory would predi t.
Fo using on the last few years, bond pri es rose sharply as the repo rate headed toward

those surpluses to shift out the demand for government bonds, as gure 9 depi ts. As people
substitute out of buying goods and servi es and into buying bonds, the aggregate pri e level
de lines, either now or in the future.
Through the debt-valuation relation alone, lower real interest rates exert deationary
pressures on the e onomy. Deationary pressures work

against

the Riksbank's aim to use

negative poli y interest rates to raise ination. To support the Riksbank's a tions, s al poli y

an eliminate deationary pressures by making government bonds less desirable. Bonds

lose their appeal when their real ba kingfuture primary surplusesde lines. In terms of
gure 9, a lower path for surpluses would oset the ee ts of lower real interest rates to pivot
the

B2d

demand s hedule left toward its initial position,

B1d .

Swedish s al poli y during the negative poli y interest rate period has not aimed to
oset the impa ts of low interest rates on the desirability of government debt. Instead, net
lending as a per entage of GDP has moved from

−1.6

per ent in 2014 to

1.2

per ent over

2016 and the rst two quarters of 2017. To the extent that this shift in net lending raises
the path of surpluses that people expe t, this s al poli y makes government debt still more
attra tive, amplifying the deationary pressures.
Re ently in Sweden, both monetary and s al poli y have in reased the desirability and
value of government bonds. Poli ies have shifted the demand

urve down, as in gure 9, to

reate deationary pressures through the bond market. This may help to explain Sweden's
hroni ally low ination rates.

Con

The paper has pointed to types of analysis that are not

ommonly undertaken by either

monetary or s al authorities, but may shed light on how those poli ies are ae ting the

entral banks estimate or

alibrate interest-rate rules, whi h

are used in poli y analyses to provide information on how a tual poli y

The

The paper's examination of Swedish ma roe onomi
