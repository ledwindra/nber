Are Asset Demand Functions Determined by CAPN?

ABSTRACT

The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPH) says that the responsiveness of
asset—demands to expected returns depends (inversely) on the variance—covari—
ance matrix of returns,, rather than being an arbitrary set of parameters.

Previous tests of CAPM have usually computed covariances of returns around
sample means, and then checked whether the riskier assets are those with the

higher mean returns. We offer a new technique for testing CAPM. The
technique requires the use of time series data on actual asset—holdings, and

non—linear maximum likelihood estimation. We claim superiority to earlier
tests on three grounds. (1) We allow expected returns to vary freely over
time.

(2) The alternative hypothesis is well—specified: asset—demands are

linear functions of expected returns that do not depend on the variance—
covariance matrix.

(3) The test—statistic has a known distribution; it is

simply a likelihood ratio test. We try the technique on yearly data, 1954—
1980, for household holdings of a portfolio of six assets: short—term bills
and deposits, tangible assets, federal debt, state and local debt, corporate
debt, and equities.. Our test rejects the CAPM hypothesis.

1. INTRODUCTION
The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) provides a compelling
framework for modeling the asset demands of investors who care about not only

expected returns but risk as well. The model has traditionally been tested
empirically by looking for a significant relationship between various assets'
expected returns and their risk as measured by covariances with the overall

market rate of return.1 However such tests were in the late 197Os subjected to
some powerful methodological criticisms.2 While more sophisticated tests continue
to be proposed,3 some of the leaders of the finance field appear to believe
that the well—specified test of.CAPM still does not exist.4 A well—specified
test would consist of a test statistic that has a known distribution under
the null hypothesis that CAPM holds, and preferably under some meaningful

alternative hypothesis as well. This paper claims to offer such a test.
To understand the test, it might help to think about asset—demands from

the macroeconomic viewpoint. Macroeconomists have never doubted that the
demands for various assets are functions of their expected returns. The
question is, what determines the parameters in these functions? The CAPH
answer is that the parameters are inversely related to the coefficient of

risk—aversion and the variance—covariance matrix of returns. It is worth
recalling that the Tobin—Markowitz model was first developed by a macro—
economist to answer precisely this question,5 not by a stock market analyst
to help choose his clients' portfolios nor by a business school professor to

demonstrate the wonders of efficient financial markets. However, empirical
tests of CAPM on the aggregate level have at best repeated the methodology
used in the microeconomic finance tests.6

2

The test proposed here requires a willingness to use time series data
on actual portfolios held, rather than restricting the analysis to time
series data on rates of return as most previous studies have done.7 The
data used here are the holdings of the aggregate U.S. household sector among

six assets: consumer durables and real estate; short—term U.S. government
securities, open market paper, and deposits; long—term federal debt; state

and local debt; corporate bonds; and equities. It would be possible, indeed
desirable, to apply the technique to more disaggregated data.

where x is a vector of portfolio shares allocated to each of the G — 1
assets (the Gth asset is eliminated as redundant; in our case G = 6

and

the redundant asset is Treasury bills and other short—term assets);

A coon stumbling block is how to model expectations, which are unobservable. Usually the expected return is assumed constant, and estimated by
the sample mean. At best it is allowed to change gradually over time as an
ad hoc ARIMA process or as a distributed lag of its own past values, or of

other observable variables. But the way we have set up equation (2), all
that is needed here is to assume that expectations are rational, i.e. that
the ex post realized returns are given by

specification of equation (4) is that it allows expected returns to vary from

period to period S much as they want. Fluctuation in interest rates, the expected inflation rate, the expected rate of return on equity, etc., has indeed

been large in recent years. Furthermore we have made no ad hoc assumptions
about what determines actual returns or expected returns, other than that
expectations are rational.

Table 1 reports the results of the OLS estimation. The estimates indicate,
for example, that it would take a 30.39 percent increase in the expected aitnual
return on corporate debt to induce investors to accept an increase in their

holdings of corporate debt equal to 1 per cent of their portfolio. This
assumes that the increase comes at the expense of the omitted asset, short—

term bills and deposits. To calculate the effect of a 1 per cent increase
in corporate debt at the expense of another asset, take the difference of
the two relevant coefficients.

Only a few of the coefficients appear significantly different from zero by

t—tests. But all but one of the individual equations do appear significant by

F—tests)° To do an overall test of the system of equations we must compare the

3. ESTIMATION OF CONSTRAINED ASSET—DEMAND FUNCTIONS

We now consider the restrictions imposed on the asset—demand function
(1)

by CAPt

Since the econometrics are necessarily discrete—time, we adopt

a discrete—time theoretical framework. Consider four assumptions:

6

(Al) perfect capital markets
(A2) optimization of end—of—period expected utility

(A3) normal distribution of returns
(A4) constant relative risk—aversion.

12

As we show in Appendix 1, these assumptions imply a restriction on the asset—
demand function (1) that is astonishingly simple:13

S

=

[p]

where p is the constant of relative risk—aversion and 2 is the G — 1XG

— 1

variance—covariance matrix of returns. Intuidvely, investors will respond less
to a given disparity in expected returns if the perceived uncertainty

(12)

is high, or if their risk—aversion (P) is high.
The conventional way to estimate the optimal portfolio is to estimate the

sample variance—covariance matrix of ex post returns. But such an approach pre—
suxnes that expected returns are constant, an assumption we have been trying to

avoid, and on the other end leaves us with a constant estimated optimal portfolio,
which would be difficult to compare rigorously to the time—varying actual port-

folio x

The key insight of this paper is that Q is precisely the variance—

covariance matrix Ecc' of the error term in equation (4), and that the equation
should be estimated sublect to this constraint. The imposition of a constraint
between the coefficient matrix and the error variance—covariance matrix is
unusual in econometrics, and requires maximum likelihood estimation Ofl..E). Once

we have done this estimation, we have our test of CAPM: we compare the log
likelihood at the constrained maximum, to the log likelihood of the uncon-

strained version that we have already done in Table 1. Appendix (2) shows the

the negative numbers in the fourth row for example that corporate bonds are

But we have chosen in this paper to emphasize the use of our technique to
test the CAiPM

hypothesis, rather than

the use of the technique to impose the

hypothesis. The log likelihood for the estimates in Table 2 is 154.19
a substantial decrease from the unconstrained log likelihood 259.42 .

In

other words, the fit has worsened. Twice the difference is far above the
5 per cent critical level. This constitutes a clear rejction of the CAPM
hypothesis.

Perhaps the constraint that p =

2.0

is too restrictive and accounts for

the magnitude of the decline in the likelihood function. We searched over

the range p = 1.0

to p = 20.0 with the technique. The likelihood function

CONCLUSION

How could CAPM fail to hold? Do our results imply that investors are
irrational? The failure of any one of the four CAPH assumptions listed above

could explain the finding. Investors may be rational but may have to optimize
subject to constraints such as imperfect capital markets. Or they may be
maximizing an intertemporal utility function, A

la

Merton (1973) and Breeden

(1979), that is more complicated than a function of the mean and variance of

end—of—period real wealth. Or returns may not be normally distributed. Or
investors may not have a constant coefficient of relative risk—aversion.
Our rejection of the null hypothesis could also be due to the failure
of other assumptions -that we have made in our model, but that are not part

of CAPM most narrowly defined: homogeneous investors, a constant variance—
covariance matrix, rational expectations, the aggregation of the assets into

six, and the accurate measurement of the holdings of those assets. The test
could be refined with respect to most of these assumptions, especially by
greater disaggregation of the assets or the holders.

The Capital Asset Pricing Model is a very attractive way to bring struc-

ture to asset—demand functions. One possibility is that true asset demands

are equal to those given by the CAPM formula plus some other factors. The
other factors would not necessarily have to be large for our technique to

reject the null hypothesis. This is entirely appropriate. We are testing

11

the hypothesis that CAP)! holds exactly. But it does allow the possibility
that CAP)! may still have something to tell us about asset demands despite
our statistical rejection of it.

Appendix 1

In this appendix we derive the correct form f or the asset—demands of an

investor who maximizes a function of the mean and variance of his end—of—period
real wealth.

Let W be real wealth. The investor must choose the vector of portfolio shares x that he wishes to allocate to the various assets. End—of—
period real wealth will be given by:

But it is inconvenient to impose this constraint in the

econometrics. Nor do we need it, since the constraint on the coefficient
matrix already gives us 25 overidentifying restrictions.)
For economic intuition, we can invert (A2) to solve for the portfolio
shares, the form analogous to (1):

=

Q Cov(z41, 4+i) + (P1)1Ez+i

.

The asset demands consist of two parts. The first term represents the
"minijjm—variance" portfolio, which the investor will hold if he is extremely

For example, suppose he views deposits as a safe

asset, which requires that the inflation rate is nonstochastic. Then his

minimum—variance portfolio is entirely in deposits: the G — 1

are all zero because the Coy in (A3) is zero. The second term represents
the "speculative" portfolio. A higher expected return on a given asset induces
investors to hold more of that asset than is in the minimum—variance portfolio,
to an extent limited only by the degree of risk—aversion and the uncertainty
of the return.

The Berndt, Hall,

we modified a program written by Paul Ruud, based on this algorithm.15

APPENDIX 3

DATA

The main source for data on supplies of nine assets held by households was the Federal Reserve Board's Balance Sheets for the U.S. Economy

(October 1981) Table 702. This source was used in place of the Fed's Flow of
Funds Accounts, Assets and Liabilities Outstanding, to which it is closely
related, because only the Balance Sheets include data for tangible assets,
i.e. real estate and consumer durables (see page iii of the Flow of Funds

for an explanation). The variables used in the econometrics are shares of
wealth, the supply of the asset in question divided by the sum of all nine
asset supplies.

The asset supplies were taken from the Balance Sheets as follows. Real
16

estate is line 1 (total tangible assets) minus line 7 (consumer durables).

Consumer durables is line 717 Open market paper is line 25. Short—term U.S.
government securities are line 20 [not available before 1951]. Deposits is
the sum of lines 13, checkable deposits and currency, 14, small time and
savings deposits, 15, money market fund shares, and 16, large time deposits.
Long—term federal debt is line 18 (U.S. government securities) minus line 20.

State and local debt is line 23. Private bonds are line 24 (corporate and

foreign bonds) plus line 26 (mortgages held).18 Finally, equities are
line 27 (corporate equities) plus line 32 (noncorporate business equity))9
For three of the asset supplies——long—tern federal debt, state and local
bonds, and private bonds——the numbers represent book value and must be multiplied by some measure of current market prices to get the correct measure of

market value. The very large decline in prices of bonds over the postwar
period make this correction a crucial one. (Equities and tangible assets
are already measured at market value, while capital gains and losses are

17

irrelevant for the three short—term assets.) Measures of the current market
bond prices are reported by Standard and Poor's Trade and Security Statistics

Security Price Index Record (1982): page 235 for U.S. government bond prices,
233 f or municipal bond prices, and 231 for high grade corporate bond prices.

Standard and Poor's computes the price indexes from yield data, assuming a
3% coupon with 15 years to maturity for the federal bonds and a 4% coupon
with 20 years to maturity for the. other two.2°

Among the rates of return, the two most problematical are those on real
estate and durables, taken here as the percentage change in price indices

reported in the Economic Report of the President 1982: the home purchase
component of the CPI (p. 292) and the durable goods personal consumption

expenditure component of the GNP deflator (p. 236). There exist better
measures of house prices, and unpublished estimates of imputed service returns
on housing and durables, but they are not available for the entire sample

period. When the two tangibles are aggregated, we use real estate appreciation
as the return.

The short—term assets are straight—forward. The rate of return on open
market paper is the interest rate on commercial paper from the Federal Reserve

Board: Banking and Monetary Statistics 1941—1970, table 12.5, Annual
tical Digest 1970—79, table 22A, and ASD 1980, table 25A. The rate of return
on short—term government securities is the treasury bill rate: 9—12 month
issues (certificates of indebtedness and selected note and bond issues; the
1—year bill market yield rate is not available before 1960) from BMS 1941—1970,
and the 1—year bill secondary market from ASD 1970—1979, table 22A, and

ASD 1980, table 25A. The rate of return on deposits is the rate on 90—day
bankers' acceptances from EMS 1941—1970, table 12.5, ASD 1970—1979, table 22A,

18

and ASD 1980, table 25A. Alternatives such as the return on money market funds
might be theoretically preferable but are not available for the early part of

the sample period. Note that in aggregating non—interest paying money together
with interest—paying accounts, we are assuming that the former performs an
implicit liquidity service that brings its return up to the explicit return

of the latter. When the three short—term assets are aggregated, we use the
Treasury bill rate as the return.

Each of the long—term assets entails a yield plus capital gains. For
each of the three kinds of bonds, capital gains are percentage change in the
same bond prices from Standard and Poor's Trade and Securities Statistics that

were discussed above. The yields are from the same source: respectively, the
median yield to maturity of a number of government bonds restricted to those
issues with more than ten years to maturity, p. 234, an arithmetic average of
the yield to maturity of fifteen high grade municipal bonds, p. 232, and an

average of the MA Industrial and Utility bonds, p. 219.

(The yields are also

available from the Fed sources: EMS 1941—1970, table 12.12, ASD 1970—1979,
table 22A and ASP 1980, table 25A1) For equities, capital gains are percentage
change in Stanford and Poor's index of common stock prices from BNS 1941—1970,

table 12.16, ASP 1970—1979, table 22A, and ASP 1980, table 26A. To capital
gains we add the dividend price ratio on common stock, from EMS 1941—1970,
table 12.19, ASP 1970—79, table 22A, and ASP 1980, table 25A.

The foregoing are all nominal returns. To convert to real returns we
use the percentage change in the CPI, from the Economic Report of the President

1982. To be precise we divide one plus the nominal return by one plus
the inflation rate. Subtracting the inflation rate from the nominal return
would give approximately the same answer, and when we computed real returns

19

relative to the numeraire asset the two inflation rates would conveniently
drop out, but this answer would differ from the correct one by a convexity
term.

Absent from the calculations is any allowance for differences in tax

treatment. In particular, the returns on state and local bonds, and to
some extent on tangibles, are here understated relative to the other assets

because

they are tax—free. The unconstrained constant term that we allow

for in the econometrics should capture most of this effect (and any other

constant omitted factors such as the service return from tangibles, as
well).

But it would be desirable to compute after—tax real returns instead.

6. Nordhaus and Durlauf (1982) is one of the very few attempts to test
CAPM on a comprehensive portfolio of highly aggregated assets, similar

to the portfolio used in the present study: corporate fixed capital,
housing, short—term government bonds, long—term government bonds, and
consumer durables.

7. A few studies, such as Friend and Blume (1975) have dared to look at

actual portfolios held by households, but not in time series form. Use
of consumption data in tests of Breeden's (1979) intertemporal CAPM may
have accustomed the finance profession to time series data on quantity.

8. The choice to express returns relative to a numeraire is not restrictive.
We could generalize (1) slightly to

rrt÷i

x =a+E Id
t

L r÷i
where S

is

C — 1

by C .

Then when we invert

21

Id

Jt+i
we need only subtract the last row from each of the others to get an

equation of the precise form as (2). In what follows we only use (2)
anyway.

Note, incidentally, that we must avoid the temptation to think that
because "expected inflation cancels out" relative real returns can be

replaced with relative nominal returns. If i÷1 is the nominal return

on a particular asset j and t+l is the inflation rate,

1+ij

The validity of the technique depends on the assumption that the asset—

demand function (1) holds exactly. If asset demands are determined by
CAPM

plus

other factors, the null hypothesis does not hold.

10. The test that the coefficients in a row are significantly different from
zero is a test that the asset in question is not a perfect substitute

for Treasury bills and other short—term assets. The 5 per cent critical

level for the F statistic is 2.68
11. The estimated log likelihood is given by equation (6) in Appendix 2, with

and Q substituted in for the true parameters. The

the estinates

last of the three terms is simply —

tr cQ c =

tr

because cQ

=

(See C. S. Maddala,

metrics (N.Y.: McGraw—Hill) 1977, p. 487 after equation C—50.) So the
test statistic varies only with the determinant of Q .

Under the zero—

22

coefficient constraint, Q is simply the variance—covariance matrix of
the raw data, the relative rates of return.

(We do allow f or a non—zero

constant term.) Unconstrained, Q is the variance—covariance matrix of
the residuals of the C — 1

equations. Because the residuals are

correlated across equations, T logQ is somewhat less than the sum
of the lags of the C — 1

individual equations' sums of squared residuals,

and the log likelihood is correspondingly greater than the sum
C — 1

of

the

individual log likelihoods. (The 5% significance level for the

test is 37.65)
12. The utility function will have a constant coefficient of relative risk—
aversiOn if it is a power function:
1

We

1—P

could replace the last two assumptions with the single assumption of

quadratic utility. But that assumption is unrealistic, and we will need
to assume a normal distribution anyway in order to do our maximum likelihood estimation.

The solutián to the one—period maximization problem considered here
(Assumption 2) will give the same answer as the general intertemporal
maximization p±tblem if the utility function is further restricted to

the logarithmic form, the limiting case as p goes to 1.0 ,

or

if

expected retunis in future periods are independent of the realization of

this period1s return. See Merton (1973, pp. 877—78) or Fama (1970).
13. The derivation is relegated to the Appendix, not because of any degree

of complexity, but rather because of its familiarity. Some similar
formulations are Friend and Blume (1975, equation 5), Black (1976,
equation 4), and Friedman and Roley (1979, equation 20').

14. On the other hand, state and local bonds, surprisingly, appear to be
complementary to federal debt, as is reflected also by a negative sign

in the corresponding entry in Table 2. This illustrates how big a
difference it makes to compute the covariance around a time—varying

expected return (half of —.0007 in this case) rather than the simple
covariance around the mean, which does turn out to be positive

(+.0052 in this case) as we would expect. If the model is correct,
the apparent positive correlation of real returns on these two kinds of
bonds was a positive correlation of their expected returns, not the
unexpected returns.

15. This is the same program used in Frankel and Engel (1982). An analytic
solution was derived in Frankel (1982) for a problem that was the same
but for the absence of an intercept term to be estimated.

16. An alternative here is to subtract lines 38 and 39, mortgages owed by
households, viewing them as a liability that is institutionally tied to

the real estate asset. One cannot explain otherwise households' decision
to hold on net a negative quantity of mortgages on risk—return considerations, as the mortgage rate is higher than that on other bonds.

17. An alternative here is to subtract lines 40 and 41, consumer credit,
viewing it as a liability that is tied to the durables asset, for the
same reason as in the previous footnote.

18. An alternative here is to add in also lines 30 (life insurance reserves),
31 (pension fund reserves) and 34 (miscellaneous assets). These cannot
be treated as separate assets because their rates of return are not

24

available, but it is desirable to have all forms of wealth included
somewhere, and they fit into the category of private bands better than
anywhere else.

19. An alternative here is to subtract the difference of lines 44 and 33,
representing net security credit, viewing it as a liability that is
tied to the equity asset.

20. These same bond prices were reported in the Federal Reserve Board's
Banking and Monetary Statistics 1941—1970. They have been discontinued
apparently because the Capital Markets Section at the Federal Reserve
Board feels that dispersion in the coupon rate and shifts in the tern
structure make the aggregation of all long—tern bonds no longer possible.
But some correction for the market price is clearly preferable to none.
