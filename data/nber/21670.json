    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper explores the consequences of extremely low real interest rates in a world with integrated but heterogenous capital markets, nominal rigidities and an effective lower bound (a ZLB for simplicity). We establish four main results: (i) At the ZLB, creditor countries export their recession abroad, which we illustrate with a new Metzler diagram in quantities; (ii) Beggar-thy-neighbor currency and trade wars provide stimulus to the undertaking country at the expense of other countries; (iii) (Safe) public debt issuances and increases in government spending anywhere are expansionary everywhere; (iv) When there is a scarcity of safe assets, net issuers of safe assets import the recession from abroad.\n\n",

We thank the NSF for financial support. While this paper was under review, Emmanuel Farhi suddenly passed away, a monumental loss to us and to the economics profession. We revised this manuscript trying to hold true to Emmanuel\u2019s views. All remaining errors and mistakes are our own.
