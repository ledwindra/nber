    "abstract": "\n\nUsing an analytical general equilibrium model, we find closed form solutions for the effect of energy policy on factor prices and output prices.  We calibrate the model to the US economy, and we consider a tax on carbon.  By looking at expenditure and income patterns across household groups, we quantify the uses-side and sources-side incidence of the tax.  When  households are categorized either by annual income or by total annual consumption as a proxy for permanent income, the uses-side incidence is regressive.  This result is robust to sensitivity analysis over various parameter values.  The sources-side incidence is also regressive, but this result is sensitive to parameter values.  Incidence results across regions are also presented.\n\n",
