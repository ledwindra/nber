    "abstract": "\n\nA model of capacity choice and utilization is developed\nconsistent with value maximization when investment is irreversible\nand future demand is uncertain. Investment requires the full\nvalue of a marginal unit of capacity to be at least as large as\nits full cost. The former includes the value of the firms option\nnot to utilize the unit, and the latter includes the opportunity\ncost of exercising the investment option. We show that for\nmoderate amounts of uncertainty, the firm's optimal capacity is\nmuch smaller than it would be if investment were reversible, and a\nlarge fraction of the firm's value is due to the possibility of\nfuture growth. We also characterize the behavior of capacity and\ncapacity utilization, and discuss implications far the measurement\nof marginal cost and Tobin's q.\n\n",
