INTRODUCTION
The United States has always had a federal system of revenue-raising and

government expenditure, but recent trends have given the states more freedom to
determine how funds are spent, especially in the realm of welfare. While this freedom
allows state programs to reflect the heterogeneity of state preferences, it comes at a cost:
the federal government served as the coordinator state actions and could internalize the
externalities generated by state taxation and spending. An individual state may not be
able to impose an otherwise desirable tax if businesses or wealthy tax-payers will move
out of the jurisdiction in response, for example, but all states might be better off if each
were required to impose the same tax. The recent devolution of welfare programs into
block grants has prompted concern of a race to the bottom between states.
Understanding how one state’s actions affect other states is fundamental to understanding
both the distribution of spending across states and the effect of policies that change the
degree of budget centralization. This paper discusses the reasons one state’s spending
might affect others’, estimates the magnitude of those effects, and evaluates the use of
different measures of “neighborliness” in different contexts.
States are clearly concerned about how their expenditures and tax rates compare
with those of their neighbors. One reason may be the fear of driving away taxpayers or
attracting welfare recipients from other states if their benefits are too generous.1 Many
states have recently enacted rules to limit benefits to new residents out of concern for
such immigration. These limits were permitted under the 1996 welfare law, although one

1

such rule was recently overturned by a federal judge in Pennsylvania. The state argued
that it “wanted to discourage people from shopping around for the best benefit.”
Washington State has a similar law “designed to prevent an influx,” according to a state
spokesman (New York Times, Oct. 14, 1997). Given this concern, a change in spending
by one state may trigger a corresponding change by neighboring states.
Another reason states may react to the actions of their neighbors is that voters may
judge politicians relative to those in nearby states. Besley and Case (1995) find evidence
of this “yardstick competition.” Voters may also benchmark their state’s performance in
other regards against the performance of other states, such as in the realm of health or
education. All of these suggest that state spending and revenue decisions may have
spillover effects on neighboring states. How big are these effects? Which states have the
biggest influence on others? How does or should this affect federal policy?
Case, Hines, and Rosen (1993) estimate the effect of one state’s spending on that
of its neighbors, using a model of spatially-correlated random effects developed by Case
(1991) that relies on variation in neighbors’ covariates to separate out correlated errors
from true spillovers. They find that states’ per capita expenditures are positively and
significantly influenced by their neighbors’ spending, and that omitting this spillover
effect would yield biased estimates of the effects of other covariates on state spending.
They focus on a measure of “neighborliness” based on the percentage of the population
that is black.

1

See Brown and Oates (1987) and Borjas (1996), although see Levine and Zimmerman (1995) for
counterevidence. Brueckner (1998) reviews the mixed evidence. See Hoyt (1993) for the implications of
voter mobility on tax competition.

2

Recent work by Figlio, Kolpin, and Reid (1999) estimates spillovers in welfare
spending in particular, finding similar results. Consistent with theory about migration
concerns, they find greater responses to decreases in neighbors’ spending than to
increases in spending. Their identification also relies on neighbors’ covariates, but they
define neighborliness based on interstate mobility.
Using alternate methodology I find that, while many of the basic results hold,
variation in neighbors’ covariates may be inadequate to correct for the endogeneity of
neighbors’ spending, and the emphasis on the percent black-based weighting matrix may
be misleading. I use several measures of neighborliness (based on geography, income,
percent of the population that is black, and interstate mobility), and use more plausibly
exogenous variation in state medical spending to instrument for actual spending. Unlike
neighbors’ covariates, these instruments are validly excluded from the second stage
regression. Within this framework I am able to explore the predictive value of different
measures of neighborliness.

II.

METHODOLOGY

A. Case, Hines and Rosen
I use a model following Case, Hines, and Rosen (CHR) to test the degree to which
state spending is affected by the spending of neighbors. They begin with a system of
expenditure equations:

E t = φWE t + X t β + ut

3

(1)

where Et is a (48 x 1) vector of state expenditures, W is a weighting matrix of
“neighborliness,” and Xt is matrix of covariates including state and year dummies,
population density, state per capita income and income squared, federal grants to states
and localities, the fraction of the population above age 65, the fraction of the population
between 5 and 17, and the fraction of the population that is black. The CHR data is from
the 48 continental states over the period 1970 - 1985.
They allow for spatial correlation between the error terms u of the form

(2)

ut = ρWut + ε t

where the ε terms are uncorrelated across states.
Because of the presence of the other right-hand side variables X, they can (with
some restrictions) invert the system to solve for the dependent variable, Et:

E t = ( I − φW )

−1

X t β + ( I − φW )

−1

( I − ρW ) −1 ε

(3)

They can then estimate this system via the maximum likelihood technique
developed by Case (1991). All that remains is to specify the form of the weighting matrix
W. They suggest three possibilities: geographic proximity, per capita income levels, and
percent of the population that is black.

In each case, they create a time-invariant

weighting matrix based on the average of the variable over time. For example, in the case
of per capita income levels, each weight is:
4

wij =

1
inci − inc j Si

where Si = ∑ j

1
inci − inc j

(4)

and where inci is the state’s average per capita income over the sample. The percent
black weights are defined similarly. Geographic neighborliness is 0 if the states do not
share a border, and 1/(number of border states) if they do.
This procedure is roughly equivalent to instrumenting for the endogenous righthand side variable neighbors’ spending with the neighbors’ Xs, although the maximum
likelihood procedure is more efficient than two-stage least squares and allows the error
terms to be spatially correlated.2 One criticism of this specification is that neighbors’ Xs
could be correlated with the error term.

One such case, which CHR find to be

implausible, is that neighbors’ Xs could be proxying for mismeasurement of a state’s own
Xs.

Unobserved local economic conditions, for example, could be correlated with

neighbors’ income, which would produce biased estimates of the effect of neighbors’
spending on state spending if neighbors’ income were used as an instrument for
neighbors’ spending.
Their results, which appear in Table 2 of their paper and are summarized in Table
1 here, indicate that using any measure of neighborliness, the spending of neighbors is an
important determinant of state spending, in that the joint hypothesis that ρ = φ = 0 is
soundly rejected. Their preferred weighting matrix is the one based on percent of the
population that is black, because it gives the most significant results. It is from this

5

specification that they draw the conclusion that a one dollar increase in a state’s
neighbors’ spending increases its own spending by 70 cents. This sensitivity appears
across several different categories of spending, including health and human services,
education, administration, and highways. They also conclude that, since the coefficient
on federal grants goes down significantly, traditional measures of the flypaper effect are
inflated by the fact that “neighbors” face similar changes in grants over time.
It is puzzling that the only weighting matrix that is completely invariant with
respect to economic conditions, changing populations, and changing political climates geographic contiguity - actually produces a significant coefficient of the opposite sign: an
increase of one dollar in neighbors’ spending is estimated to decrease a state’s spending
by 22 cents. Because of the difficulty in interpreting these coefficients and because of the
possibility that neighbors’ Xs may be correlated with omitted variables such as economic
conditions, exploring the effect of neighbors using another methodology may be
enlightening.3

B. Alternate Methodology
My estimation differs from previous work in three regards. First, I use several
different weighting matrices to determine neighborliness and explore the implications of
using each. Second, I try to disentangle true spillover effects from correlated errors using
2

They note that ignoring the spatial autocorrelation would not lead to inconsistent estimates of the
parameter β, but would lead to inconsistent estimates of the standard errors.
3
Conley (1999) describes alternate methodology for efficient IV estimation with spatial dependence. While
his estimates are less parametric than CHR in some ways, they require measures of neighborliness that are
symmetric (as well as the choice of a cut-off distance). For example, Rhode Island must have as great an
impact on New York as New York has on Rhode Island. For this reason, none of the weighting matrices
described above can be used. Nevertheless, I also describe rudimentary estimates using this methodology
for comparison below.

6

a source of variation that I argue is more plausibly exogenous. Third, in order to do this, I
use a data from a different time period.
There are several reasons, discussed above, that we might expect states’ actions to
affect their neighbors. States may be concerned about taxpayer (or welfare recipient)
mobility: if their taxes (or benefits) are higher than those of their neighbors, taxpayers
may move out (or welfare recipients may move in). This would imply that states are most
influenced by the actions of those states to which their taxpayers (or from which welfare
recipients) may move. Voters may also judge politicians’ actions relative to the actions
of politicians in neighboring states. This would imply that states are most influenced by
the actions of those states that their voters judge to be the most “similar” or whose actions
are most salient to the voters.
These motivations suggest several possible weighting matrices for neighborliness.
CHR’s weights may proxy for voter “yardsticks” or for potential mobility.

Actual

interstate mobility patterns may be a better proxy for how much each state is influenced
by others. Population-based geographic weights, where larger neighboring states are
given more weight than smaller ones, may capture this influence more than the equalweight matrix of CHR.
The problem with the income-based and percent black-based weights is that they
may proxy for other omitted variables. Income, for example, is a determinant of the
federal match rate for several programs such as Medicaid and AFDC. Although income
is included as a covariate, it may not adequately capture the price effects of the federal
match. Similarly, percent black could proxy for several unobserved aspects of the state

7

economy or the needs and tastes of the population.4 Thus, while I will present results
using all three of the CHR weighting matrices, I will also add population-based
geographic weights and interstate mobility-based weights.5
I begin with OLS regressions of the effect of neighbors’ spending on state
spending. I create a weighted average of neighbors’ spending (based on one of these five
different criteria), and then estimate:

E it = φ wi E t + X it β + ε it

(5)

where Eit is state per capita general expenditures (in 1987 dollars), E t is a (48 x 1) vector
of each state’s spending in year t, wi is a vector assigning a “neighborliness” weight, and
Xit , similar to CHR, includes population density, state per capita income and its square,
federal grants to states and localities, the fraction of the population above age 65, the
fraction of the population below 15, the fraction of the population that is black, and state
and year dummies.
There are several reasons that we might doubt the validity of these OLS estimates.
If, as CHR estimate, there are negatively correlated random errors between neighbors
(such as if the political climate made business move from one state to its neighbor), then
the OLS estimates would be biased down. If there are positively correlated errors, such as
common unobserved economic downturns, the OLS estimates might be biased up.
4

CHR acknowledge that it might appear that percent black is proxying for some other variable, and address
several possibilities, including the income distribution, urbanicity, the cost of providing services, and
regional effects.

8

To correct for this type of problem, we need some source of variation correlated
with neighbors’ spending but uncorrelated with the error term in equation (5). One
potential source of variation is neighbors’ Xs, used by CHR. I create “neighbor” values
for these variables in the same way that the neighbor value for spending was created,
using five different weight matrices.

I use these neighbor-weighted variables to

instrument for actual neighbor spending in equation (5). The first stage is thus:

wi E t = wi X t β + ε it

(6)

where X t is a (48 x 7) matrix of the 48 state values for each of the seven Xs (percent old,
percent young, percent black, income, income squared, population density, and federal
grants) in year t, wi is a (48 x 48) weighting matrix for neighborliness, and E t is a (48 x
1) vector of state spending in year t.
In an effort to find instruments that are less likely to be correlated with omitted
state characteristics, I use three sources of variation in state medical spending to
instrument for the actual state spending of neighbors on the right-hand side.6 The first
instrument is an index created from federally-mandated Medicaid eligibility expansions
in the 1980s and 1990s which measures the potential cost to a state of its Medicaid

5

I use the fraction of all in-migrants to state i that come from state j to create wij, rather than net migration
between the two states. Figlio et al. argue that this is a better measure because it does not allow large
symmetric movements to cancel each other out. Results do not vary substantially with alternate measures.
6
See Baicker (1998) for details on the construction of these instruments.

9

eligibility rules in a given year.7

The index isolates the effect of the legislative

environment from other confounding factors.8
The second instrument relies on the fact that overall medical price increases had
differential effects on state budgets. States with initially larger public medical spending
programs faced a greater fiscal shock as medical prices rose. State spending on Medicaid
in 1982, inflated by the real growth of national medical expenditures, should capture a
state-specific, exogenous budget shock.
The third instrument is based on the Boren Amendment, which in 1980 required
states to reimburse nursing homes for Medicaid patients at a “reasonable” rate. Several
lawsuits initiated by nursing homes in the late 1980s and early 1990s were successful in
the courts and led to increases in reimbursement rates in those states. This change in the
cost of Medicaid reimbursement is captured by a dummy variable for the presence of a
successful suit.
I create “neighbor” values for these variables in the same way that the neighbor
value for spending was created, using five different weight matrices.

I use these

neighbor-weighted variables to instrument for actual neighbor spending in equation (5).
The first stage is thus:

wi E t = λ 1 wi boren t + λ 2 wi medtrend t + λ 3 wi index t + X it β + ε it

7

(7)

There is evidence that these expansions increased access to, utilization of, and spending on Medicaid
services. Cutler and Gruber (1996b) find that each additional dollar in their eligibility index leads to 30
cents of increased spending. Currie and Gruber (1996) show that increased eligibility for children, while
not fully taken-up, does lead to increased utilization of services.

10

where boren t , medtrend t , and index t are each (48 x 1) vectors of the 48 state values in
each year, and where Xit contains the seven CHR covariates as well as these three
Medicaid variables. Each of the five weighting matrices produces significant results in the
first stage.9
Expenditure data come from the Census of Government Finances. Demographic
data come from the Bureau of the Census Current Population Reports. I use the 48
contiguous United States in the years 1983-1994. Table 2 presents summary statistics for
this data and for the CHR data. The weighting matrices are constructed analogously to
CHR.

The population-based geography weight is {population/(total population of

neighboring states)} for neighboring states, and 0 otherwise. Interstate mobility data
comes from the 1980 PUMS one percent sample, and the weight is the fraction of
immigrants to a state that came from each other state.

III.

RESULTS
The “OLS” columns of Table 3 present the results of estimating equation (5) with

the five different weighting matrices. The coefficients generated using the geography,
population-weighted geography, and interstate mobility weights are all similar: a one
dollar increase in neighbors’ spending increases a state’s spending by somewhere
between 46 cents and one dollar. The income and percent black weights, however give

8

See Currie and Gruber (1996) for details. I also show results isolating the mandated portion of spending,
or “bite” of the expansions, below.
9
The joint F statistic for the geography weight was 88.79, for the income weight was 24.23, for the percent
black weight was 28.94, for the population-based geography weight was 101.00, and for the interstate
mobility weight was 215.14.

11

very different estimates: the effect of neighbors’ spending is negative and statistically
insignificant.
Results from using neighbors’ covariates as instruments are reported in the “IV1”
columns of Table 3. All of the weighting matrices now produce positive estimates of the
effect of neighbors’ spending on state spending, ranging from .24 to 1.00. The estimates
using the percent-black and income-based weights (in this specification as well as those
below) are higher than the corresponding OLS estimates, consistent with the CHR
estimate of negative spatial correlation in errors. More on this below. The biggest
difference between these results and the CHR estimates is that I do not obtain a negative
estimate using geographic weights. Given the marginal significance (and sign) of their
geography-based estimates, this difference does not seem a cause for concern. While
CHR find the one-for-one increase in state spending caused by increases in federal grants
to diminish in the case of the percent black weights, I do not. No portion of the “flypaper
effect” can be attributed to the fact that neighbors are receiving similar changes in federal
grants.
As discussed above, we may be concerned that these estimates are picking up
mismeasured or omitted variables on the right-hand side. To test this, I perform a Newey
test of overidentifying restrictions. These instruments fail the test: neighbors’ Xs are not
validly excluded from the second stage regression.10
The “IV2” columns in Table 3 present the results of using the three sources of
exogenous variation in Medicaid spending as instruments. The results are similar across

10

The test statistic of NR2 produces probabilities (from a chi-squared distribution with 6 degrees of
freedom) of 1.3 x 10-11 (geography), 4.0 x 10-6 (income), .001 (percent black), 6.0 x 10-6 (populationweighted geography), 2.4 x 10-12 (interstate mobility).

12

all of the weighting specifications: a one dollar change in its neighbors’ spending causes
a state to increase its spending by 37 to 88 cents. The only cases where the IV estimate is
significantly different from the OLS estimate (using a standard Hausman test) are when
the income or percent black weighting matrices are used. These instruments, unlike the
neighbors’ Xs used in the IV1 columns, pass the Newey test (with the exception of the
specification with income-based weights).11 The IV2 results are significantly different
from the IV1 specification in the case of the percent black weights and the interstate
mobility weights.12
Again, in the case of the percent black- and income-based weights,

the IV

estimates are larger than the OLS, consistent with negative spatial correlation of errors.
Figlio et al. also find that IV estimates are higher, which is at first pass surprising
(although neither they nor CHR identify the source of this negative bias). If omitted
variables were biasing the OLS estimates, we might expect those variables to be
positively correlated across states, which would bias OLS estimates of spillovers up.
There are several candidate explanations for this negative correlation. First (and least
plausibly), omitted variables may be negatively correlated across neighboring states.
Second, the marginal state affected by the instruments may have a larger response than
the average state. For example, if only “stingy” states are affected by the instruments,
then the IV estimates will be driven by the neighbors of stingy states, who may feel more
constrained to keep spending low than the average state without stingy neighbors would.
This seems unlikely to be the case, given that some instruments are more likely to affect
11

The probabilities are .08 (geography), .04 (income), .27 (percent black), .13 (population-weighted
geography), and .14 (interstate mobility).

13

higher spending states, and, as discussed below, estimates using any subset of the
instruments yield the same results. Third, classical measurement error may be biasing the
OLS results toward 0. This is perhaps the most plausible explanation, for two reasons:
(1) we only see a significant reversal in the case of percent black and income, which seem
most likely to be measuring neighborhood with error, and (2) when I restrict the sample to
the smallest quintile of states, which are most likely to measure spending with error, the
OLS estimates using the other weights are also significantly lower.
We might be concerned that the “index” instrument (which combines required
eligibility with voluntary eligibility based on state-year eligibility rules) is picking up
state choices for early expansion that may be correlated with changes in regional
preferences or fiscal constraints. (Time or state invariant conditions are of course picked
up by the fixed effects.) Isolating the portion of this eligibility index that is mandated by
the federal government would net out common shocks to preferences or constraints
(although federal laws will only be binding in states that are less generous, so we will
only pick up the reactions of the neighbors of those less generous states). To this end I
replace the “index” instrument with a rough measure of the “bite” of federal eligibility
expansions.13 These results are very consistent. In the specification using mobility-based
weights, for example, the spillover coefficient changes from .88 (with robust standard
error of .17) to .91 (.19).

Removing the eligibility instrument altogether yields an

estimate of .89 (.17). This similarity might arise in part because the eligibility instrument
12

The “IV3” columns in Table 3 include both neighbors’ Xs and the Medicaid variables as instruments.
These results are very similar to the IV1 specification.
13
Unfortunately I can only use a very crude measure of this “bite”: the difference between each state’s
AFDC need standard (which roughly governs Medicaid eligibility in the absence of intervening federal law)

14

is not strong, but using just the eligibility index alone also yields a very consistent
estimate of .79 (.22).
I can also compare these results to those obtained using the Conley methodology.
As discussed above, this requires the use of a symmetric weighting matrix, so I construct
an unweighted geographic-contiguity measure of neighborliness. Software limitations
restrict me to performing Conley’s spatial GMM on less than half of the states and do not
allow a full set of controls.

As a limited example, I choose the first 20 states

alphabetically and run a specification with only per capita income and percent black as
controls. In this specification, the usual IV estimate (using the Medicaid instruments) is
.86 with a standard error of .09, while the “spatial GMM” estimate is .73 with a standard
error of .20.

Spending on Different Budget Categories
We might expect different types of spending to be more sensitive to neighbors’
spending than others.

There may be more yardstick competition in administrative

spending or education spending, or there may be greater fear of recipient immigration in
social services spending. This also suggests that different measures of neighborliness
may be appropriate for different categories of spending. States may look to geographic
neighbors to judge transportation expenses, while looking to states where residents move
to or from when concerned with welfare magnet issues.
Table 4 looks at state spending by category, including social services, education,
transportation and public safety, and administration, using the IV1 and IV2 specifications
and the federally mandated lower income bound for eligibility in each year. See Yelowitz for a similar

15

and three different weighting matrices. While CHR find that state spending on all
categories responds about equally to neighbors’ spending (from .42 for social services to
.70 for education), using IV1 I find that some categories are significantly more responsive
than others. Again, the results differ greatly when different weighting matrices are used.
Social services spending does indeed seem to be most sensitive to neighbor weighting
based on interstate mobility patterns under either IV specification. 14
Unfortunately, we do not have alternate instruments for spending in any category
other than social services. Since the Medicaid variables used as instruments in the IV2
specification affect only public welfare spending (see Baicker 1998), it is not appropriate
to use them as instruments for other types of spending. This does, however, allow for
another specification check: regressing state spending on the other categories on
neighboring states’ spending instrumented with the Medicaid variables should yield
estimates of 0. This is indeed the case. Using mobility weights, for example (filling in
the missing values from column (9) of Table 4), results in an effect on education of .04
(.06), on transportation and public safety of .02 (.04), and on administration of .03 (.01).
So, which weighting matrix is the best? If each weight really captured a different
aspect of the interactions between states, it would be appropriate to put several differently
weighted averages of neighbors’ actions on the right-hand side. Table 5 presents such
estimations. The percent black and interstate mobility matrices seem to be the most
robust, with income and geography being the least, although there is no clear-cut winning
approach. In this context this measure does not have enough power to use in isolation.
14
It is important to note that the estimates using the interstate mobility weights are implausibly large in
several instances, especially in the case of education, where the coefficients are significantly larger than 1.
Such a system would not be stable, with any change in expenditures generating an explosive reaction. The

16

specification.15

Column (12) includes all 5 weighting matrices, but column (11) is

preferred because of the high correlation between the two measures of geographic
proximity. We can interpret these coefficients as weights on the weighting matrices if we
divide by the sum of the coefficients. In every specification in which it is included, the
mobility-based weighting matrix receives the highest weight. In the case of column (11),
geography receives a weight of .1, income of .25, and percent black and mobility each of
.33.
Given the importance of geographic mobility, we might imagine that states with
high mobility (or in-migration) would be more sensitive to their mobility-defined
neighbors than those with low mobility. I test this hypothesis by dividing the states in
half based on the fraction of their 1980 population that moved in after 1975. Using the
same specification, the spillover effect in neighbor spending is 1.60 (.46) for high
mobility states, but only .69 (.19) for low mobility states. These results suggest that the
states with the greatest potential in-migration are those that are most concerned with
staying in line with their neighbors’ spending.

IV. CONCLUSIONS
State spending is significantly influenced by the spending of neighboring states.
States raise their spending by something between 37 and 88 cents for every dollar
increase in their neighbors’ spending.

Specification checks suggest that identifying

CHR system can only be inverted to solve for E if the coefficient of spatial correlation lies strictly between 1 and 1.
15
Neighbors’ spending based on different weights is of course correlated. The geographic measures are the
most correlated, with a correlation coefficient of .90, while geography and percent black and income are the
least correlated, with correlation coefficients between .46 and .59.

17

spillover effects through variation in neighbors’ covariates is inappropriate. Using more
plausibly exogenous variation in Medicaid expenditures, I obtain more consistent
estimates of the spillover effects of state spending across different weighting matrices. In
particular, percent black- and income-based weighting matrices produce different results
from geographic- and mobility-based measures when identification comes from variation
in neighbors’ covariates, but not when variation in Medicaid spending is used. The
degree of interstate mobility is the strongest predictor of spending spillovers.
This study leaves several unanswered questions for future research.

While

estimates using Medicaid variables as instruments improve on those using neighbors’
covariates in some ways, these instruments cannot be used for other categories of
spending, so it is not possible to say whether some categories are more sensitive to
neighbors’ spending than others.

Other instruments should be used for those

comparisons, such as changes in incarceration policy, highway funding, or education
spending requirements.
Furthermore, we would in theory like to be able to determine the appropriate
weighting matrix for different types of state spending. While it seems clear that measures
based on percent black are not ideal, it is not clear that any other matrix is best in every
situation. With better instruments to identify changes in other spending categories, it
would be possible to test which set of neighbors is important for each state spending
decision. Different interstate spillover effects in different spending categories might
imply very different optimal structures for federal grants to states and localities.
What does seem clear is that an individual state’s spending has spillover effects
on the spending of its neighbors, and this externality implies a role for the federal

18

government in influencing state spending levels. It is difficult to evaluate whether state
spending would be “too high” or “too low” in the absence of federal intervention, or
whether or not changes in the financing of different programs would lead to a race-to-thebottom (or to the top – or even what the right benchmark for spending is), but the level
and geographic dispersion of state welfare benefits certainly affect the standard of living
of poor Americans. The federal government has powerful tools (such as matching rates
that lower the price of state spending on some programs) influence state expenditures,
especially in light of the multiplier implied by these spillovers. An analysis of these
effects should be a key component of the design of federal and state policies.
