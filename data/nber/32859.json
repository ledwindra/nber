    "abstract": "\n\nPost-covid inflation was predominantly driven by unexpectedly strong demand forces, not only in the United States, but also in the Euro Area. In comparison, the inflationary impact of adverse supply shocks was less pronounced, even though these shocks significantly constrained economic activity.  With output already weakened by these unfavourable supply conditions, any attempt by the European Central Bank to further mitigate the demand-driven inflationary pressures---to maintain inflation near its 2-percent target---would have severely hampered an already anaemic recovery.\n\n",
