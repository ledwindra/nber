But these sovereign powers in hand the state can exploit the producers by taxing and spending for its\" own purposes.  Using a general equilibrium model in which people can choose to be either\" producers or predators, this paper rationalizes the biblical request, Make us a king. analysis shows that, if the technology of predation is sufficiently good better for everyone, including both producers and potential predators even though a king maximizes the consumption of a ruling elite.\n\n",
