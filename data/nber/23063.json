    "abstract": "\n\nDespite great focus on and public investment in STEM education, little causal evidence connects quantitative coursework to students\u2019 economic outcomes. I show that state changes in minimum high school math requirements substantially increase Black students\u2019 completed math coursework and their later earnings. The marginal student\u2019s return to an additional math course is 10 percent, roughly half the return to a year of high school, and is partly explained by a shift toward more cognitively skilled occupations. White students\u2019 coursework and earnings are unaffected. Rigorous standards for quantitative coursework can close meaningful portions of racial gaps in economic outcomes.\n\n",
