A Black Swan in the Money Market

NBER Working Paper No. 13943
April 2008
JEL No. E43,E44,E52
ABSTRACT
At the center of the financial market crisis of 2007-2008 was a highly unusual jump in spreads between
the overnight inter-bank lending rate and term London inter-bank offer rates (Libor). Because many
private loans are linked to Libor rates, the sharp increase in these spreads raised the cost of borrowing
and interfered with monetary policy. The widening spreads became a major focus of the Federal Reserve,
which took several actions — including the introduction of a new term auction facility (TAF) — to
reduce them. This paper documents these developments and, using a no-arbitrage model of the term
structure, tests various explanations, including increased risk and greater liquidity demands, while
controlling for expectations of future interest rates. We show that increased counterparty risk between
banks contributed to the rise in spreads and find no empirical evidence that the TAF has reduced spreads.
The results have implications for monetary policy and financial economics.

On Thursday, August 9, 2007 traders in New York, London, and other financial
centers around the world suddenly faced a dramatic change in conditions in the money
markets where they buy and sell short-term securities. The interest rate on overnight
loans between banks—the effective federal funds rate—jumped to unusually high levels
compared with the Fed’s target for the federal funds rate. Rates on inter-bank term loans
with maturities of a few weeks or more surged as well, even though no near-term change
in the Fed’s target interest rate was expected. Many traders, bankers, and central bankers
found these developments surprising and puzzling after many years of comparative calm.
The turmoil did not disappear the next day. The overnight interest rate whipsawed
sharply down on Friday as the New York Fed pumped liquidity into the market, with the
rate overshooting the target on the down side by a large margin. Even more worrisome
was that term inter-bank rates, those for loans lasting a month to several months, moved
up further on Friday despite the increase in liquidity provided by central banks. Rates on
term lending, such as the Libor one- and three-month rates, seemed to have become
disconnected from the overnight rate and thereby from the Fed’s target for interest rates.
It was as if banks suddenly demanded more liquidity or had grown reluctant to lend to
each other, perhaps because of fears about the location of newly disclosed losses on subprime mortgages.
As we now know, that Thursday and Friday of August 2007 turned out to be just
the start of a remarkably unusual period of tumult in the money markets, perhaps even
qualifying as one of those highly unusual “black swan” events that Taleb (2007) has
recently written about (see Cecchetti 2008 for a full discussion of the events leading up to
and including the crisis). The episode raises important questions for monetary theory and

1

policy. At a minimum, the sharp increases in spreads provide new data to stress test our
theories of the term structure of interest rates. Moreover, the money market represents
the first stage of the monetary transmission channel, where monetary policy actions first
come in contact with the rest of the financial system and the entire economy. Term
money market rates, such as 3-month Libor, affect the rates on loans and securities from
home mortgages to business loans. A poorly functioning money market impinges on the
availability and cost of credit to businesses and households and jeopardizes the
effectiveness of monetary policy.
The Federal Reserve made several attempts to improve conditions in money
markets and thereby reduce the spread between term inter-bank lending rates and the
overnight rate. Early on, it lowered the penalty on borrowing at the discount window
bringing the discount rate below the prevailing Libor rate, and it strongly encouraged
banks to borrow. But banks were reluctant to borrow from the discount window and there
was little response. Then in December 2007—four months after the crisis began—the Fed
introduced a major new lending facility, the Term Auction Facility (TAF), through which
banks could borrow from the Fed without using the discount window.
The purpose of this paper is to document these unusual developments in money
markets, assess various theories underlying them, and evaluate the impact of policy
actions like the Term Auction Facility. In the original draft of this paper, written in
February 2008, we put forth the hypothesis, based on a simple financial market model,
that the Term Auction Facility would not reduce the spreads between Libor and the
federal funds rate when correcting for term expectations, contrary to the purpose of the
facility. We also provided statistical tests that could not reject this hypothesis. However,

2

because the spread narrowed from December 2007 through February 2008 after the TAF
was introduced, central bank officials and others judged that the TAF was working. For
example, Mishkin (2008), speaking in mid February of 2008 and noting the decline in the
term spread, stated that “the TAF may have had significant beneficial effects on financial
markets.” Soon thereafter, however, the spread widened again, adding evidence to
support the theoretical hypothesis put forth in this research. The renewed stress in the
markets also gave rise to a host of new Federal Reserve actions and lending facilities.1
Though the financial turmoil persists, we view the introduction of these new
facilities and actions as marking the beginning of a new phase of the crisis, where new
policy responses will be evaluated and tested. Accordingly, this study focuses on the first
phase of the crisis, more specifically, the period from Thursday, August 9, 2007 through
Thursday, March 20, 2008. Sufficient observations have accumulated during the 161
trading days of this first phase to draw several conclusions that are of interest from a
theoretical perspective and may be useful to policy makers going forward.

1. The August 9 Break Point: Target, Effective, and Term Fed Funds
Figure 1 focuses on three money market interest rates which nicely illustrate the
changes in market conditions in August 2007—(1) the target for the federal funds interest
rate as set by the Federal Open Market Committee, (2) the daily effective overnight
federal funds rate in the market, and (3) the interest rate on 3-month Libor. The Libor
interest rate in the London inter-bank market in dollars is essentially the same as the

1

On Tuesday March 11 the new Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF) and the expansion of the TAF
from $60 billion to $100 billion was announced. On Friday March 14 a new loan package to Bear Stearns
through JP Morgan was announced. On Sunday March 16 a new Primary Dealers Credit Facility (PDCF)
was announced.

3

interest rate on term fed funds for comparable maturities, so we focus on the former in
this study. (Nothing material would change if we focused on rate on term fed funds
directly.)
First, observe in Figure 1 that the volatility of the effective federal funds rate (the
average rate at which overnight fed funds actually transact) relative to the target
increased after August 9. During the period from the start of the year through August 8,
2007, the standard deviation of the difference between the effective funds rate and the
target was only 3 basis points. From August 9, 2007 to March 20, 2008 the standard
deviation was 20 basis points. Note that the steadiness of the federal funds rate at 5.25
percent may be one of the reasons for the relatively small misses in the earlier period, but
if you include the years back to the beginning of 2002 the volatility is 6 basis points, still
much less than the 20 basis points seen during the period that we study. There have been
other periods where the effective funds rate was more volatile, particularly before the Fed
became more transparent about its interest rate setting. Taylor (2001) presents a model
that focuses on effective fed funds rate volatility.
Second, and this is the main focus of our paper, observe how the spread between
3-month Libor and the Fed’s overnight federal funds rate target increased dramatically
starting in August and fluctuated erratically after that. During the year before August 9,
2007, the 3-month Libor spread above the target federal funds averaged only 11 basis
with a standard deviation of a mere 1 basis point—a period of very low volatility. Similar
changes in spreads between term rates and overnight rates are apparent for other Libor
maturities and for several other countries, as we document below.

2. Potential Explanations
Ever since the turmoil began, traders, bankers, economists, and others have
offered explanations for the dramatic increase in the Libor spread. We think it is useful to
categorize the many explanations into several types.
First, and perhaps the most commonly mentioned explanation is “counterparty
risk,” which simply means banks became more reluctant to lend to other banks because
of the perception that the risk of default on the loan had increased and/or the market price
of taking on such risk had risen. Recall that inter-bank lending in the Libor market or
term fed funds is unsecured.

5

Of course, this explanation has the virtue of reflecting the widely-reported reality
that many banks were writing down the values of securities that they owned. These
securities had either been downgraded in terms of quality or were backed by sub-prime
mortgages that were becoming delinquent or going into foreclosure as housing prices
stopped increasing and began to fall. Clearly, the continuing decline in housing prices
and the slowing economy could easily raise the chances of a further deterioration in the
value of mortgage-related assets on the banks’ balance sheets. Moreover, the realization
of the risks in derivative securities based on sub-prime mortgages triggered doubts about
many other aspects of the derivative market, including the ability of credit default
insurers to meet their obligations and the size and nature of the likely restructuring of the
off-balance sheet operations known as structured investment vehicles (SIVs).
Another explanation, which might be called “liquidity risk,” is that traders at one
bank are reluctant to expose the traders’ bank’s funds during a period of time where those
funds might be needed to cover the bank’s own shortfalls. Effectively, the trader may not
be given as much “balance sheet” to invest, which is perceived as a shortage of liquidity
to the trader. While it is difficult to distinguish counterparty risk from liquidity risk, we
note that the interest rate on CDs, which are also held by individuals and non-banks,
follows Libor closely during this period. Hence, it is not only banks that are getting
premiums when lending to banks, indicating that once counterparty risk is taken into
account there is little additional role for liquidity risk as defined here.
A third and closely related explanation was often heard during the period of
November and January. Banks needed liquidity to make sure that their own balance

6

sheets looked respectable in end-of-year financial reports, especially given the stress and
scrutiny that many banks had been under.
The fourth explanation relates to expectations of future interest rate changes.
Expectations of declining overnight rates, for example, will cause term Libor rates to
decline as well, all else equal. Except for the very beginning of the turmoil period, this
explanation would tend to bring the spread between the Libor rate and the target fed
funds rate lower because of expectations of future interest rate decline due to policy
easing. It is necessary to take account of this factor when assessing the other factors that
could be moving the spread around. For example, if you look closely at Figure 1 you see
that the spread between Libor and the fed funds target comes down before cuts in the
federal funds rate. Indeed, toward the end of our sample in mid February, the spread
narrowed significantly, but this could be due to expectations of future interest rate cuts.
We therefore control for expectations of future interest rates in the analysis that follows.

3. A Model
In order to distinguish between these various explanations we need a model of
money market interest rates through which we can interpret the risk, liquidity, and
expectations factors that we have argued are important. It is essential to take out pure
expectations effects, which always create differences between longer term interest rates
and overnight fed funds. Recall that Libor is a term rate (3 month in Figure 1) and fed
funds are one-day maturity.
Early models of the money market used for monetary policy developed in
the1970s and 1980s (see Anderson and Rasche, 1982, for a review) are not sufficient for

7

this purpose because they neither account for forward-looking expectations nor risk
premia. More recent finance models used by Ang and Piazzesi (2003) and others are
more useful for this purpose. Moreover the earlier models used estimated demand
functions for securities, an approach that is not possible to implement in the current
situation, because available data is in the form of prices (in the form of interest rates),
rather than quantities.
Our model focuses on three interest rates as defined below:

it( n ) = libor rate with maturity n (with n = 1 defined to be the overnight federal funds rate)
s t( n ) = OIS with maturuity n (with n = 1 also the overnight federal funds rate; that is st(1) = it( 1 ) )
at(n) = accepted bid on the term action facility (TAF) (n around 30 days)
The Overnight Indexed Swap (OIS) rate is closely connected to the average overnight
interest rate expected to prevail over the next n days. An OIS is structured as follows: at
maturity, the parties exchange the difference between the interest that would be accrued
from repeatedly rolling over an investment in the overnight market and the interest that
would be accrued at the agreed OIS fixed rate. The TAF is described in detail below.
Following the literature on arbitrage-free pricing of bonds, we write down term
structure relations for the Libor (or fed funds) term structure interest rates. Let Pt (n )
denote the price of a zero-coupon loan with n periods until maturity. Equation 1 relates
the yield on the loan, it(n ) , to its price. The prices of zero-coupon loans follow the
recursion given in equation 2, where mt +1 denotes the pricing kernel. As in Ang and
Piazzesi (2003), we assume the pricing kernel takes the form shown in equation 3 and the
market price of risk, λt , takes the linear form shown in equation 4, where xt is a vector of
variables that affect the price of risk.

8

(1) it( n ) = n −1 log( Pt ( n ) )
(2) Pt

( n +1)

= Et [mt +1 Pt (+n1) ]

(3) mt +1 = exp(−it(1) − 0.5λt2 − λt ε t +1 )
(4) λ t = − γ 0 − γ 1 xt

Similar equations can be written down for the OIS and the TAF rates. In contrast to
Libor loans, OIS transactions involve very little counterparty risk as no money changes
hands until the maturity date. The only potential loss in the case of default by the
counterparty is the difference between the two interest rates on which the OIS is based.
There does exist interest rate risk reflecting uncertainty regarding the future path of
interest rates. However, given the relatively short maturities of loans that we study, the
market price of interest rate risk is likely typically to be small. In the following, we
assume that the market price of risk associated with OIS transaction is constant. Loans
from the TAF are collateralized and therefore also carry relatively small risk. We
therefore assume that the market price of risk associated with TAF loans is likewise
constant.
Taken together, this assumption of a constant market price of risk for OIS and
TAF rates implies that as part of the null hypothesis of an absence of liquidity effects in
the pricing of the various loans and abstracting from a constant differential risk premium,
we have: at( n ) = st( n ) . Moreover, absent liquidity effects, we would not expect the λi for
the inter-bank rates to be influenced by the TAF.

9

Under these assumptions, the OIS rate equals the average of the overnight interest
rates expected until maturity. By subtracting the appropriate OIS rate from the term
Libor yield, we are able to cleanse expectations effects from the Libor yield. Under our
null hypothesis of no liquidity effects, the resulting difference in rates, it( n ) − st( n ) , reflects
only the pricing of risk associated with Libor lending relative to the constant price of risk
associated with OIS transactions. Thus, in the next section, we use this difference in
yields as a measure of the effects of risk on yields. We will use several different
measures of counterparty risk as explanatory variables in the price of risk, as explained
below.2

4. Focusing on the Libor OIS spread

Figure 2 plots the spread between Libor and OIS during the same period as in
Figure 1. It paints quite a different picture of the spread, and shows the value of removing
expectations of future interest rates in analyzing term spreads. For example, looking at
Figure 1 you might think the spread returned to normal by mid February. However,
examination of Figure 2 shows that the spread is still quite large. In this chart and in the
rest of our analysis we focus on 3-month Libor; similar results are found by looking at
other maturities such as one-month Libor.
Figure 2 illustrates clearly how the spread between Libor and OIS jumped on
August 9th. From December 4, 2001—the day when our OIS 3-month data begin—
through August 8, 2007, the spread averaged 11 basis points with a standard deviation of
3.6 basis points. It jumped by 25 basis points above this average to 34 basis points on
2

As described below, another measure of risk is the difference between rates on Libor and government
repurchase agreements between banks.

10

August 9th and fluctuated wildly between a minimum of 30 basis points and a maximum
of 106 basis points, averaging 65 basis points through March 20. The peak was reached
on December 6, 2007, and was followed by big downward movements on December 1214, 2007 and January 14-15, 2008. On March 20, it stood at 61 basis points, only slightly
below the average since August 9, 2007, and clearly not a return to a “normal” level.

Figure 2. Taking out the pure expectations effects

Looking at spreads going back to December 2001 illustrates just how unusual this
episode has been. Figure 3 plots the same data as in Figure 2, but starting in December
2001. As mentioned above, the spread on August 9 was 25 basis points above the preAugust 9, 2007 average. That is 7 times the standard deviation before August 9—more

11

than a 6-sigma event. The mean through March 20 was 16 standard deviations above the
old mean, which under normality would have been an extraordinarily improbable event.

Figure 3. A Black Swan in the Money Market?

Another way to remove expectations effects is to look at the spread between
unsecured inter-bank lending (Libor) and secured inter-bank government Repos
(Repurchase Agreements backed by Treasury securities) of the same maturity, in this
case, three months. By focusing on the difference between secured and unsecured
lending, this spread may be a better way to extract pure risk. However, we find much

12

more noise in this spread than in the Libor-OIS spread. Traders we have consulted
attribute this noise to technical factors such as tax considerations and collateral delivery
glitches. Figure 4 shows this measure of the risk spread. It is clearly noisier than the
spread shown in Figures 2 and 3, making the recent financial turmoil appear less
improbable than suggested by evidence based on Libor-OIS spreads. Nonetheless, these
past episodes were not nearly as large or persistent as those during the period starting in
August 2007. Because of this noise we will focus on the Libor-OIS spread as the main
“dependent variable” in the remainder of this paper, using the Libor-Repo spread along
with other measures of risk (discussed in Section 6) as independent variables.

5. Overnight Funds Volatility: Counterparty Risk or Increased Tolerance to Misses

Thus far we have shown how important it is to take out expectations effects in
order to assess the increase in risk and liquidity premia in the inter-bank market. It is also
possible to focus directly on the increase in volatility of the effective funds rate relative to
its target as set by the FOMC. Figure 5 shows the difference between the effective fed
funds rate and the target fed funds rate.
There are several possible explanations for the increased volatility or “misses” of
the effective rate from the target. One is the same counterparty risk that is offered as an
explanation for the spread seen in the term lending market. Fed funds trades are largely
bilateral. Hence, rates can differ from trade to trade, even at the same point in time. If
traders are more circumspect about some borrowers than others, then this will show up in
increased dispersion of the rates in these bilateral trades at each point in time. Since the
effective daily rate is estimated from these trades, its increased volatility could reflect the
increased dispersion. If so, then the increase in volatility in the overnight market provides
some corroborating evidence that counterparty risk may be part of the explanation for the
increased spread in the term market.
Another explanation is that the underlying volatility in intraday trading in the fed
funds market may have been driven by the New York Fed’s trading desk acting to
prevent the rate from spiking above the target. Indeed, there is a noticeable downward
bias in the misses during this period.

6. Measures and Indicators of Counterparty Risk

In this section, we consider a range of possible indicators of counterparty risk. To
the extent that these are timed with the black swan event documented in Figure 2, they
may offer evidence that such sources of risk, rather than more general liquidity concerns,
were the main reason for the increased spread in the Libor markets.

Asset Backed Commercial Paper versus Dealer Placed Commercial Paper

Another market that has been under extreme stress during this period is the
market that grew as a mechanism for financing the purchase of home mortgages in the
process of assembling them into various derivative securities. Because the commercial

15

paper was backed by these mortgages or by the mortgage pools, they are called assetbacked commercial paper. They are a potential measure of the counterparty risk in
commercial banks because banks held this paper either directly or indirectly through their
Structured Investment Vehicle operations.
Figure 6 shows the spread between asset-backed commercial paper and dealerplaced commercial paper, which excludes the more risky asset-backed issues, letter-ofcredit issues, and direct issues from firms. Clearly, there was an increase in the spread
about the same time as the Libor spreads increased and the patterns of decline and the ups
and downs also have similarities. To the extent that this is a good indicator of
counterparty risk, this timing lends support for the counterparty risk explanation.

Credit Default Swaps

Another measure of counterparty risk is the probability that banks might default
on their debt. These probabilities can be assessed using the premiums on credit default
swaps (CDS) that are like insurance policies for corporate bonds. The buyer of a credit
default swap pays a periodic fee to a seller in exchange for the promise of a payment, in
the event of bankruptcy or default, of the difference between the par value and the market
value of the corporate bond. Figure 7 shows the rapidly rising rates on five-year CDS for
several major financial institutions through March 20, 2008 including Bear Stearns. Note
the increase starting in July of 2007. Figure 8 focuses on four large commercial banks.
Unlike the asset backed commercial paper spread, there is no evidence of a decline in risk
at the time that the Libor spreads declined.

Developments in other Countries

The turmoil affecting money markets was not limited to the United States.
Spreads between term and overnight inter-bank lending have risen in Canada, Europe,
and Japan, at the same time as in the United States. The similarities and differences
across countries help illuminate the possible sources of the rise in these spreads.
Euro Libor and Pound Sterling Libor Figure 9 shows the Libor spreads for

loans in Euros and Pound Sterling using the same OIS adjustment method we used to
calculate the U.S. dollar Libor spreads in Figure 2. We plot these other two spreads along
with the dollar spread since 2004. All three spreads move closely together, indicating that

19

whatever the source of these spreads, it is affecting money markets for all three
currencies in the same way. This close correspondence in spreads is not as surprising as
it first may appear. In fact, there is considerable overlap in the lists of banks that are
included in the Libor survey in these three countries, as we document in the Appendix.

Figure 9. Libor spread increased in three major currencies in August 2007

Yen Libor and Tibor. Another useful indicator is a comparison of the Libor rate

denominated in Yen to that of the Tibor, the rate on inter-bank loans between Japanese
banks in the Tokyo markets. In the appendix, we report the banks in the two surveys.
Figure 10 shows these two rates since the mid 1990s. Note that the chart shows the Libor
yields themselves, not spreads. Japanese interest rates have been much lower than

20

interest rates in the United States, Europe or the UK. Nonetheless, spreads can and do
develop between different types of inter-bank lending and indicate risk factors in the
banking sector. Indeed, in the late 1990s, Japanese banks experienced sizable spreads on
inter-bank lending comparable to what is being experienced in New York and London in
this recent episode of stress. As explained by Peek and Rosengren (2001) and Corvig,
Low, and Melvin (2004), risks in the banking sector in Tokyo caused interest rates on
inter-bank loans to rise in Tokyo compared with London. In other words, Tibor rates rose
relative to Libor rates, as shown in Figure 10 and Figure 11, which shows the Tibor-Libor
spread for three-month loans.

This pattern of Tibor-Libor spreads has reversed, with Tibor rates now lower than
corresponding Libor rates. One interpretation is that the demand for liquidity has not
risen as much for Japanese banks as for the major banks in these other markets. In our
view, a more probable explanation is that the risks associated with inter-bank loans from
American and European banks have increased relative to those for loans among Japanese
banks. Accordingly, the “negative Japan premium” or Japan discount provides another
measure of counterparty risk among banks in New York, London, and Frankfurt.

Swiss Libor. Finally we look at Libor loans denominated in Swiss Francs. The

Swiss National Bank (SNB) follows a different strategy for monetary operations than the
Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, or the Bank of England. The Swiss
National Bank targets the three-month Libor rate and adjusts the amount of liquidity in
the overnight market to hit its target. (For a theoretical analysis of such a policy
framework, see McGough, Rudebusch, and Williams, 2005). Hence, if there is an
increase in the spread between three-month Libor and the overnight rate, then the SNB
will take actions to reduce the overnight rate by providing extra liquidity to the market.
(Jordan and Kugler,, 2004.) As a result, a very different pattern emerges in the overnight
and term Libor rates. However, the same evidence of risk emerges if one looks at the
spread between overnight and term rates.
These actions can be seen clearly in Figure 12. With a target for 3-month Libor of
2.75 percent, the overnight rate declined, rose, and declined again while the Libor rate
remained relatively steady. Hence, the spread between Libor and overnight rates was
realized by moving the overnight rate around. The way this works is nicely illustrated in
the period from August 2007 through March 2008.

7. The Term Auction Facility

In an effort to lower the unusual term lending spreads documented in Figure 2, the
Federal Reserve took a number of actions. First it lowered the spread between the
discount rate and the fed funds target directly and encouraged more discount window
borrowing. But, banks did not increase their borrowing to any large degree. Second, in
December 2007, the Federal Reserve established a new facility called the term auction
facility (TAF) to provide liquidity directly to financial institutions at a longer duration,
and thereby drive down the spread on term lending relative to overnight loans.
According to the Federal Reserve Board, by injecting “term funds through a broader
range of counterparties and against a broader range of collateral than open market
operations, this facility could help ensure that liquidity provisions can be disseminated

24

efficiently even when the unsecured interbank markets are under stress” (Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve, 2007).
The TAF was first announced on Dec 12, 2007. The TAF allows financial
institutions to make bids for term borrowing from the Fed, with maturities typically of 28
days. Beginning in late December of 2007, two TAF auctions have been held each
month. Table 1 provides key information about each of the auctions that occurred during
the period of our study. TAF loans are collateralized following the procedures used for
discount window borrowing. The Board of Governors sets the auction amount and the
minimum bid allowed for the interest rate, which is set equal to the OIS rate
corresponding to the term of the loan. The interest rate on the loans is determined in a
single-price auction and is reported as the “TAF” rate in Table 1. The spread between the
TAF rates and the OIS rate at the time bids were taken averaged around 50 basis points
for the first two auctions, but then fell in subsequent auctions, before rising again to
around 40 basis points in the first auction of March, 2008.

Early reports on the effectiveness of the TAF were generally favorable. The
auctions were oversubscribed and the TAF rates were below the one-month Libor rate
prevailing at the time that bids were submitted, as seen in Table 1. Moreover, as noted
above, Libor-OIS spreads fell sharply between late December and mid January. Figure
13 shows the dates of the TAF auctions with vertical lines along with the Libor-OIS
spreads at one- and three-month maturities. After the first two auctions, the TAF rate has
been between 4 and 16 basis points below the prevailing one-month Libor rate.

Figure 13. Timing of the TAF auctions and Libor – OIS spreads

At the same time the TAF was introduced, other central banks, including the Bank
of Canada, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank (ECB), and the Swiss National

26

Bank, also took measures to increase term lending. The ECB and SNB launched their
own term auction facilities starting in December of 2007. These auctions are summarized
in the Appendix. The ECB and SNB participated in TAF auctions in December and
January that occurred on days in which the Fed held TAF auctions. No further ECB or
SNB TAF auctions took place during our sample (they have since restarted after the end
of our sample). In addition, the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England increased their
term repo lending in December and January; those programs were then curtailed (they,
too, have since restarted).

Figure 15. As TAF borrowings from the Fed go up, non-borrowed reserves decline to
offset the increase, keeping total reserves unchanged

In assessing the effects of the TAF, it is important to note that it does not increase
the amount of total liquidity in the money markets. Any increase in liquidity that comes
from banks borrowing from the Fed using the TAF will be offset by open market sales of
securities by the Fed to keep the total supply of reserves from falling rapidly. The actions
are essentially automatic in the sense that the Fed must sell securities to keep the federal
funds rate on target. Figure 14 shows that this is indeed what has happened under the
TAF. The System Open Market Account reduced its outright holdings of securities (light
blue area) by essentially the same amount as the TAF (dark blue area). This can also be
seen in Figure 15: Note that TAF borrowings have increased dramatically only to be
completely offset by a sharp decline in non-borrowed reserves leaving total bank reserves
at the Fed largely unchanged.

8. Econometric Tests

In this section, we endeavor to test how various factors—including the risk
measures explored in previous sections, and liquidity measures like the TAF—affect the
Libor-OIS spread. Simply put, the term structure model described in this paper implies
that risk factors should affect the spread and the TAF should not, and this is what we
would like to test. To be sure, by focusing on the impact of the TAF on the spread we do
not mean to imply that the Federal Reserve did not have other goals in creating the TAF,
including reducing the stigma associated with discount window borrowing by banks.
Nevertheless, reducing the spread was one of the purposes of the TAF and one of the
ways suggested to measure its success. For example, as stated by Mishkin (2008),
“Isolating the impact of the TAF on financial markets is not easy, particularly given other
recent market developments and the evolution of expectations regarding the federal funds
rate. Nonetheless, the interest rates in term markets provide some evidence that the TAF
may have had significant beneficial effects on financial markets….term funding rates
have dropped substantially relative to OIS rates: The one-month spread exceeded 100
basis points in early December but has dropped below 30 basis points in recent weeks-though still above the low level that prevailed before the onset of the financial disruption
last August.” See also Board of Governors (2008) for similar comments regarding the
purpose and early evaluation of the effects of the TAF.
Our tests are performed with simple regressions, summarized in Tables 2 and 3.
In each regression we use daily data, as presented in the charts above, during the sample
period from January 2, 2007 through March 20, 2008, a span of time that includes both

29

the market turmoil period and a comparable period of time before the turmoil. The
dependent variable in each case is either the three-month Libor–OIS spread, shown in
Table 2, or the one-month Libor-OIS spread, shown in Table 3. The independent
variables are various indicators of counterparty risk, including the asset backed
commercial paper spread (CP spread), credit default swaps for major banks (CDS-CITI
and CDS-BOA), the Tibor-Libor spread (for the 3 month maturity regression only), and
the Libor-Repo spread. These variables are listed in left hand columns. Each regression
also includes a TAF dummy (TAF) which is one on each of the TAF bid submission
dates and zero elsewhere. There are five sets of regressions corresponding to the
different risk measures. For each of the risk measures, we report OLS regressions as well
as regressions corrected for first-order serial correlation (AR(1)), with the estimated serial
correlation coefficient ρ reported.

In all cases, the risk measures enter with the correct sign and are usually highly
significant in both the one-month and the three-month maturity regressions. In contrast,
the TAF dummy variable is always insignificant or of the wrong sign. The common
theme of these results is that (1) one can easily reject the null hypothesis that the
counterparty risk factors are not significant in the Libor OIS spread and (2) one cannot
reject the null hypothesis that the TAF has no effect.

9. Conclusion

In this paper we documented the unusually large spread between term Libor and
overnight interest rates in the United States and other money markets beginning on
August 9, 2007. We also introduced a financial model to adjust for expectations effects
and to test for various explanations that have been offered to explain this unusual
development.
The model has two implications. First is that counterparty risk is a key factor in
explaining the spread between the Libor rate and the OIS rate, and second is that the TAF
should not have an effect on the spread. Since the TAF does not affect total liquidity,
expectations of future overnight rates, or counterparty risk, the model implies that it will
not affect the spread. Our simple econometric tests support both of those implications of
our model.

Appendix Tables 1 and 2 provide lists of banks participating in the various Libor
surveys and the Tibor survey in 2007. The U.S., Euro, and UK lists all include the same
14 banks (out of 16 banks in each survey). The Libor is computed taking the average of
rates in the survey, after dropping the 25 percent highest and 25% lowest rates. The
Tibor is computed by averaging the rates in the survey, after dropping the two highest
and two lowest rates.
Appendix Table 3 summarizes the results from the TAF auctions held by the
European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank during our sample period. Note that
the European Central Bank TAF auction was structured so that the TAF rate was identical
to that from the corresponding TAF auction held by the Federal Reserve.
