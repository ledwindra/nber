    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper examines the robustness of explanatory variables in cross-country economic growth regressions.  It employs a novel approach, Bayesian Averaging of Classical Estimates (BACE), which constructs estimates as a weighted average of  OLS estimates for every possible combination of included variables.  The weights applied to individual regressions are justified on Bayesian grounds in a way similar to the well-known Schwarz criterion.  Of 32 explanatory variables we find 11 to be robustly partially correlated with long-term growth and another five variables to be marginally related.  Of all the variables considered, the strongest evidence is for the initial level of real GDP per capita.\n\n",
