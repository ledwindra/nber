ABSTRACT
The politicization of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was extreme, with the popular moniker of
"Obamacare" and 54 House attempts to repeal the law in the four years after passage. Our study set
out to understand Washington state public's preferences about enrolling into ACA driven health insurance
programs, the role that political polarization may play on the chances that the uninsured would enroll
and the extent to which individual mandate may influence these choices. A representative mail survey
among the registered voters of Washington State. We find that 27% have not ruled out purchasing
insurance through the Exchange, but their ambiguity is most likely driven by conflicts between health
care needs and financial worries on one hand and their political views on the other. Overall, compared
to the insured population in 2013, uninsured are significantly more likely (OR = 2.0, 95%CI: 1.1, 3.4)
to enroll through the Exchange even after all adjustments including medical needs and financial worries.
This highlights that the individual mandate may have an independent effect on enrollment for the uninsured.
However, the individual mandate effect is found to be negligible (OR: 1.1, 95%CI: 0.50, 2.8) for the
uninsured who blamed the Democrats and/or President Obama for the 2013 governmental shutdown.
Political polarization appears to have a trickle down affect at the individual choices even beyond medical
needs and financial worries. Alternative strategies, for example bipartisan outreach, may be necessary
to convince certain groups of eligible beneficiaries to consider enrollment through the Exchange.

Introduction
Presence of health insurance is often considered the most important and mutable
determinant of access to care and the receipt of adequate health care services.1 With
the Affordable Care Act, the prospect of changing the high proportion of uninsured in the US
looks better than ever. Washington (WA) State is one of fifteen states that opted under the
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) to implement both the Medicaid expansion
and to institute their own health benefit exchange – the Washington Healthplanfinder
(www.wahealthplanfinder.org). From the State's perspective, increasing enrollment in both
Medicaid and the individual market through the public-private Exchange is critical to achieving
successful implementation of the ACA. The most recent enrollment figures (as of April 23, 2014)
for the state have been encouraging, indicating that about 587,000 Washingtonians have newly
enrolled in either private health coverage or the state's Medicaid program (Washington Apple
Health) since October 1, 2013. Of these, 164,000 residents enrolled in private health plans.

While enrollment in WA has been relatively successful, there remain questions of who, among
the eligible, are not enrolling in the exchange, and why are they opting out of coverage.
Understanding the choices people are likely to make and what influences them is an important
health policy issue. In this work we study the pre-enrollment expectations for buying health
insurance through the exchange, using data from a unique state-representative mail survey of
registered voters of age 18-64 years, conducted during December 2013 – January 2014. We
categorize voters into three categories based on their self-reported information: confident they
would buy insurance through the exchange, confident they would not buy through the exchange,
and uncertain. We then compare these groups along several dimensions, including health, past
health care use and insurance coverage and health care-related financial worries. These
comparisons can help project the likely size and characteristics of enrollees to the WA health
exchange in the future months.
3

Since the reduction of the size of the uninsured population is one of the primary goals of ACA,
we also strive to learn what these uninsured (in 2013) individuals are planning to do in regards
to buying insurance from the exchange. In addition to measures of demand for health
insurance, we study to what extent political polarization may drive these beneficiaries away from
enrolling in ACA mandated health insurance through the Exchange. Specifically, this
informative analysis examines whether such political polarization dominates perceived need for
health care and for buying health insurance. Understanding these preferences is important for
enrollment efforts carried out by any state and the federal exchange.

STUDY DATA AND METHODS

In the last quarter of 2013, our research team fielded a statewide representative USPS mail
survey, the University of Washington Survey on Health-related Attitudes of Washington
Residents (UW SHARE), to understand 1) the public’s attitude toward health insurance changes
brought on by the ACA, 2) their current health insurance coverage, 3) their demand for health
care services, and 4) their self-reported health status. The survey also asked respondents
whether they plan to buy health insurance through the WA exchange in 2014. About 40,000
resident households with at least one person between 18-64 years of age were selected at
random from the publicly available list of registered voters in Washington State2 that contained
about 4 million registered voters. Households in some of the smaller counties were
oversampled. Because all household members could not be surveyed, the eldest person in the
household between the ages of 18-64 was asked to respond to the survey. The survey was
designed to be representative both at the state and the county level, and is one of the unique
surveys in the country to capture pre-ACA data. A paper-based mail survey was chosen to be

4

the primary and only mode of survey in order to obtain responses from the remote corners of
the state where internet connections are not widely available. However, we were aware that the
survey may not appropriately represent the Hispanic population in the state as no Spanish
version of the survey was administered. Moreover, the survey, by design, would represent a
slightly older population as only the eldest in the household between 18-64 years of age was
asked to respond.

By January 31, 2014, we had received about 4,200 responses (10.5% responses rate). In order
to demonstrate representativeness of estimates from the UW SHARE survey, we compare key
demographic, health and insurance estimates to the latest estimates available from established
surveys such as the 2010 Washington State Population Health Survey (WASPHS) survey and
the 2012 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS). Importantly, we benchmark
estimates for the whole population and for citizens only using the WASPHS data, for better
comparisons to estimates from our survey, which only represents registered voters.

We then examine the distribution of the WA population who anticipate buying health insurance
through the WA exchange. We categorize this anticipation into three categories: “YES”, “NO”
and “Don’t Know/Not Sure”, where the last category potentially represents the fraction of the
population where further outreach could lead to added enrollment. To further understand these
population sub-groups, we compare respondents’ self-reported health, health care use and
healthcare related financial worries across these categories to see whether those who are
unsure about enrollment look more like those who are sure about enrolling or not enrolling
through the exchange. We project potential enrollment to the WA Health Exchange based on
these estimates.

5

We explore the anticipated enrollment through the Exchange in 2014 between people who were
insured versus uninsured in 2013. We hypothesize that compared to the insured population in
2013, the uninsured are more likely to enroll through the Exchange in 2014 for obvious reasons.
However, to understand the impact of the individual mandate under ACA in creating
opportunities and incentives for the uninsured to enroll, we study how the anticipated enrollment
preferences among the uninsured, as compared to the insured, changes as we adjust for factors
likely correlated with the demand for health insurance: demographics, self-reported health,
health care demands and financial worries about paying medical bills. We hypothesize that even
after controlling for these factors the uninsured would be significantly more likely than the
insured to enroll through the Exchange due to the impact of the individual mandate.

Finally, we explore the impact of political polarization on anticipated enrollment through the WA
exchange by the uninsured. Political polarization is based on the question: “In your mind, who is
most responsible for the government shutdown in October 2013?” Answer to this question are
categorized as “Democrats and/or President Obama”, “Republicans and/or Tea Party
Republicans” and “All parties were equally responsible”. We explore whether anticipated
enrollment of the uninsured versus the insured are additionally influenced by political
polarization towards the Republican versus the Democratic Party. Our hypothesis is that
controlling for everything else that predicts health insurance demand, political polarization would
have no impact on the decision to enroll through the health care exchange, as the demand for
insurance among the uninsured should be similar across groups with different political views.

RESULTS

Our final analytical survey sample consists of 4,169 respondents of age 18-64 years, after
dropping 25 observations (0.5%) due to high degree of missing values in their responses.
Survey weights were computed for this sample. As illustrated in Table 1, our estimates
benchmarked well with those from the citizens’ sample of 2010 WASPHS. Moreover the 2010
WASPHS for the entire population match well with the more recent 2012 estimates from the
BFRSS. Our survey did not underrepresent the Hispanic citizen’s population in 2013, but it
appears to underrepresent the African American and Asian population. However this may be a
manifestation of the fact that a fraction of these populations are classified as mixed race under
the “Other” category. As anticipated, our sample had lower rates of the youngest age group (1826 years olds). Our sample also underrepresents less than high school and up to two-yearcollege educated but does not differ from population estimates of income distribution from 2010
WASPHS citizen’s sample. This may explain the fact that our sample has lower rates of
uninsured than the 2010 WASPHS citizen’s sample and are more likely to have employersponsored insurance.

Figure 1(a) shows the distribution of anticipated purchase of insurance through WA exchange.
7% (95% CI: 5.5%, 8.0%) expressed that they will purchase insurance through the exchange
while nearly 20% (95% CI: 18%, 23%) were unsure. If this full 27% would enroll, it would
correspond to a total of 810,000 enrollees among the population of 3 million non-elderly adult
citizens in WA State. We discuss the implication of this number in the Discussions section.

Figure 1(b) examines the anticipated enrollment by the distribution of 2013 insurance-status.
Among people who were certain to buy insurance through the Exchange, 30% had no insurance
in 2013, while about 51% had some form of employer or private insurance. In contrast, among

7

people who were certain not to buy insurance through the Exchange, 86% had some form of
employer or private insurance in 2013, which could reflect simple ineligibility for the exchange.
Forty-six percent of people who were unsure about buying through exchange had employersponsored insurance in 2013, which could reflect uncertainty about the continuation of their
employment or their employer-coverage. However, a full 22% of those unsure about their
purchasing plans were uninsured in 2013, the target group for the exchange enrollment.

Many characteristics, except gender, are significantly associated with the anticipated enrollment
(Table 2). Compared to people who were not going to buy insurance through the Exchange,
people who were certain about buying were more likely to be older, be non-white, have less
than college education, have lower household income, be uninsured in 2013, demand more
health care in 2013 and have more financial worries regarding paying medical bills. This
certain-purchasing group seems to have higher demand for insurance. However, certainpurchasers and certain-non-purchasers look similar in terms of their self-reported health status.
People who were certain they would buy from Exchange were much more supportive of
Supreme Court’s decision to uphold ACA and were more likely to blame the Republicans for the
October 2013 government shutdown.

In comparison, people who were unsure about buying from the Exchange were more likely to be
younger, be Hispanic, have less than High school education, and have self-reported poor health
compared to either group who have made up their minds about buying from the Exchange.
Interestingly, this ‘uncertain’ group’s health care demand in 2013 and financial worries about
medical bills were similar to those who would buy insurance through the Exchange and yet their
attitudes towards the Supreme Court ruling and the parties responsible for government
shutdown were similar to those who would not buy insurance through the Exchange.

8

We then examine the likelihood of the uninsured in 2013 to enroll in the Exchange as compared
to the population who had insurance in 2013 (Table 3). Our study also finds that 30% of the
uninsured were certain about not enrolling through the Exchange in 2014, where nearly fifty
percent of them remained unsure. Twenty-three percent of the uninsured population blamed the
Democrats and/or President Obama for the government shutdown in 2013 compared to 14%
among the insured population (p=0.004). In contrast, the proportion who agreed with the
Supreme Court ruling on upholding ACA did not differ significantly across the uninsured and the
insured groups (45% vs 49%, p=0.39).

The unadjusted odds ratio of buying through the Exchange for the uninsured versus the insured
was 7.8 (95% CI: 5.5, 11.3). This difference between uninsured and insured populations is
largely due to demographic differences; the odds ration declines to 2.6 (95% CI: 1.7, 3.9) after
adjusting for demographics. However, further additions of other covariates related to health
insurance demand, such as self-reported health, health care demands, financial worry, ACA
perception and political polarization do not alter this odds ratio much. The final odds ratio, after
all adjustments, is 2.0 (95% CI: 1.3, 3.2) and remains significant, implying that the individual
mandate may have a significant role in making the uninsured enroll through the Exchange.

However, this potential impact of the individual mandate varies substantially across political
views (Figure 2). The odds ratio of buying from the Exchange in 2014 is significantly higher for
uninsured among people blaming all parties (OR: 1.99, 95% CI 1.1, 3.7) or only the Republicans
(OR: 3.6 95%CI 1.6, 8.2) for the governmental shutdown in 2013 versus those with any
insurance. Similar results are found when comparing uninsured to those with private insurance
in 2013. However, uninsured people were not more likely to buy from the Exchange if they
blamed the Democrats (OR: 1.1 95%CI 0.50, 2.8) for the governmental shutdown in 2013, after
controlling for all other factors. This implies that the individual mandate, as currently set, would

9

have minimal effect on enrollment for the uninsured persons who are politically against the
Democrats.

CONCLUSIONS

Non-take-up of public programs among their target population has long been a policy concern.
In the context of health insurance, the non-take-up patterns are potentially even more important
since it has implications for not just the future of the policy, but also on the ability to pool risk
across individuals and the prevailing premiums in the future, and hence the viability of the entire
health insurance system envisioned under the ACA. Unlike the Massachusetts health insurance
reform signed by Governor Romney, the politicization of the ACA was extreme, with the popular
moniker of “Obamacare” and 54 House attempts to repeal the law in the four years after
passage. Therefore, our study set out to understand WA state public’s preferences about
enrolling into ACA driven health insurance programs and especially to understand the role that
political polarization may play on the chances that the uninsured would enroll.

Our analysis finds that, in terms of health and health care demand, individuals who remained
unsure of their future enrollment in Exchange plans were not significantly different from those
who were planning on enrolling. This is good news for policy makers concerned about adverse
selection in the market; the sickest do not seem to be the ones most certain to enroll in WA
State.3 As of April 23, 2014, the WA Health Insurance Commissioner’s Office reports that
587,000 (citizens and non-citizens) enrolled through the exchange (i.e. those who were not
Medicaid redeterminations). Our projections from these survey estimates that 810,000 citizens
have not ruled out enrolling through the WA exchange.

10

However, we also find that public’s political views might be responsible for producing ambiguity
in their preference to enroll. People who were unsure about enrollment share similar health care
needs and financial worries with those who are certain to enroll but share similar political views
with those who are certain not to enroll. More intensive efforts may be needed convey the
benefits of enrollment in clear and non-partisan ways in order to sway these individuals to enroll.

One of the main targets of ACA is to reduce the number of uninsured. It is natural to assume
that, compared to those who had insurance in 2013, the uninsured would be more likely to take
up health insurance when they face affordable (through the individual market) or free (through
Medicaid expansion) health insurance options. Our data supports this assumption. In fact, our
findings, which suggest that even after controlling for all other factors the uninsured continue to
be significantly more likely to enroll through the Exchange, point out that on average the penalty
under the individual mandate may be effective in making the uninsured enroll.

However, our analyses also suggest that the current political rancor in our federal government,
and in the populace at large, plays a significant role in explaining these preferences among the
uninsured. Uninsured citizens blaming the Democrats and/or President Obama for the
government shutdown in 2013 are not more likely than those who were insured in 2013 to enroll
through the WA Exchange. This effect (of lack of it) is not driven by just one’s views on the ACA
that contribute to this divisiveness, since we include a measure of one’s stance on the Supreme
Court ruling on the ACA’s constitutionality as an adjustor in our analyses. This indicates it may
be difficult to enroll certain segments of the eligible population through the Exchange.
Alternative strategies, for example bipartisan outreach, may be necessary to convince these
groups of eligible beneficiaries to consider enrollment. This is especially true if such dynamics,
or possibly even more political divisiveness, persist in those states where a Federal Health
Exchange is set up.
