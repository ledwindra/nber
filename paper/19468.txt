Task Routineness and Trade Policy Preferences
Bruce A. Blonigen and Jacob McGrew
NBER Working Paper No. 19468
September 2013
JEL No. D72,F13
ABSTRACT
Understanding the formation of individual trade policy preferences is a fundamental input into the
modeling of trade policy outcomes. Surprisingly, past studies have found mixed evidence that various
labor market and industry attributes of workers affect their trade policy preferences, even though recent
studies have found that trade policy can have substantial impacts on workers’ incomes. This paper
provides the first analysis of the extent to which task routineness affects trade policy preferences using
survey data from the American National Election Studies (ANES). We find substantial evidence that
greater task routineness leads workers to be much more supportive of import restrictions, consistent
with recent evidence on how trade openness puts downward pressure on employment and wages for
workers whose occupations involve routine tasks. In fact, other than education levels, task routineness
is the only labor market attribute that displays a robust correlation with individuals’ stated trade policy
preferences. We also provide evidence that there are some significant interactions between the economic
and non-economic factors in our study. For example, women’s trade policy views are much more
invariant to their labor market attributes than men.

I. Introduction
Understanding how people form opinions about policies on international
economic relations, such as international trade, is a fundamental question for not only
scholars, but also policymakers. Economists typically begin with the premise that
individuals’ preferences for international economics policies (typically, regarding
international trade or immigration) are determined by how these international phenomena
affect individuals’ employment and wage outcomes. However, noneconomic factors,
such as political ideology, may also play a large factor in people’s opinions on
international policies. (O’Rourke and Sinnott, 2001)
In the economics literature, researchers have relied on either the Heckscher-Ohlin
(H-O) framework or the alternative sector-specific model to motivate predictions about
how trade will affect individual workers’ real wages and, hence, their view on trade
policy. In the standard H-O set-up, workers are mobile across sectors and so their
income depends on their labor endowments and skills, not their current sector of
employment. Assuming that income effects from trade are the main driver of trade
preferences for an individual, workers with less skills residing in a skill-abundant country
will be subject to declines in the probability of employment and real income due to freer
trade (see, e.g., Ebenstein et al., forthcoming; Autor et al., 2006; and Hummels et al.,
2011). Consequently, these less-skilled workers will favor trade protection in skillabundant countries, and vice versa.
Alternatively, workers are “stuck” in their sector, as in a sector-specific factors
model. Now workers of all skill levels in a sector are similarly affected by the sector’s
exposure to international trade. In this setting, it is only the sector’s (or industry’s)

2
particular exposure to international trade that affects workers’ wages, not their relative
skills.
Past empirical analyses using data on lobbyist positions on trade, as well as on
votes by elected representatives, largely conclude that industry characteristics, and not
human capital endowments (proxies for personal skills), determine trade policies. These
studies are likely capturing determinants of lobbying inputs, so it is not surprising that
human capital endowment measures do not hold much support. More recent analyses of
the political economy of trade protection by O’Rourke and Sinnott (2001), Scheve and
Slaughter (2001), and Mayda and Rodrik (2005) use survey data on individuals’ stated
preferences for trade policies. These studies find support for both workers’ skill levels
and industry characteristics as determinants of individuals’ support for trade protection.
However, there are a number of reasons why there may be a need to revisit and
reassess the literature. First, there have been recent concerns with the robustness of these
results (see Blonigen, 2011), calling into question that labor market outcomes affect
individuals’ trade policy views. Second, and relatedly, when these studies have also
included non-economic (what we will call personal and ideological attributes), the
evidence and magnitude of these non-economic factors is often much more substantial
than the economic forces (e.g., see O’Rourke and Sinnott, 2001, and Mayda and Rodrik,
2005). For example, studies have a found a very strong and large gender difference, with
women 8-10 percentage point more likely to favor trade protection than men, all else
equal. A final reason to reassess is the recent literature suggesting the possibility that our
traditional proxies for skill (such as education attainment) are far from ideal in measuring
the exposure of workers to the effects of globalization. In particular, Autor et al. (2003)

3
introduces a new perspective on worker’s skills and their vulnerability to international
markets by distinguishing “routine” tasks, which can be well described by deductive
rules, from “non-routine” tasks, which require pattern recognition and inductive
reasoning. This insight has generated a recent empirical literature showing that greater
international market exposure (such as offshoring) can significantly affect wages of
workers according to the routineness of the tasks required of their position. For example,
Ebenstein et al. (forthcoming) and Hummels et al. (2011) show that offshoring has
negative effects on worker’s whose jobs involve routine tasks, and positive effects for
workers whose jobs require non-routine tasks. The latter effect is consistent with
offshoring bringing productivity gains for the firms, leading to wage gains for the
remaining non-routine workers.1 Ebenstein et al. (forthcoming) shows that offshoring
has substantial impacts at the occupational level (particularly negative effects for those in
occupations that perform a high amount of routine tasks) within industries, not on wage
differentials across industries.
Importantly, task routineness is specific to one’s occupation and not necessarily
correlated with the typical measures of workers’ skills, such as those proxied by
education levels. There are a number of examples of jobs that require advanced
education, but have significant “routineness” to the tasks they do, including positions in
computer programming, x-ray technician positions, and legal services. The correlations
between years of education and measures of routineness found in Autor et al. (2003) are
0.46 for non-routine analytical (general educational development, mathematics), 0.36 for
non-routine interactive (direction, control, and planning), -0.14 for routine cognitive (set

(2008).

4
limits, tolerances, or standards), 0.03 for routine manual (finger dexterity), and -0.06 for
non-routine manual (eye, hand, and foot coordination).2 Despite the strong evidence that
task routineness of one’s occupation can affect how international market openness can
affect one’s wage income and differs from our normal measures for “skilled” labor, no
one has yet examined whether task routineness affects people’s stated trade policy
preferences.
In this paper, we examine this issue for the first time by using survey evidence on
United States individuals’ attitudes towards trade protection between 1986 and 2000.
Like Scheve and Slaughter (2001) and Blonigen (2011), we use data on individuals'
responses to a question posed by the American National Election Studies (ANES) about
whether the United States should increase import restrictions. The ANES surveys provide
much more detailed data on individual characteristics compared to other surveys used in
the literature. In addition to examining how factors such as worker skills or industry trade
characteristics affect workers’ attitudes, as in previous studies, we also examine how
these workers’ attitudes differ depending on the routineness of tasks performed in one’s
occupation. We follow the recent literature in using information on the routineness of
tasks from the dataset used in Autor et al. (2003), as well as an alternative summary
measure of task routineness used by Ebenstein et al. (forthcoming).
We find substantial evidence that task routineness is a significant independent
factor in individuals’ opinions about trade policies. In particular, a standard deviation
increase in the routineness of tasks in one’s occupation is associated with a
three-percentage point increase in the likelihood that an individual will favor new import

Many studies have used production versus non-production workers (e.g., Feenstra and Hanson, 1999),
which is likely even less correlated with task attributes of one’s position, such as routineness.

5
limits. This is consistent with the findings by prior studies that increased trade openness
will put pressure on wages of workers in occupations that have greater task routineness.
Importantly, our estimates of the task routineness effect on trade policy preferences are
robust to including other (standard) measures of labor market attributes, such as the
education of the worker and the net export share of the worker’s sector. It is also robust
to including a full set of personal and ideological attributes, including gender and
political affiliation, which have been found to be strong predictors of trade policy
preferences in previous studies. In fact, other than education levels, task routineness is
the only labor market attribute that displays a robust correlation with individuals’ stated
trade policy preferences.
We also study for the first time how the effect of labor market attributes may vary
with personal and ideological attributes, such as gender and political affiliation.
We find that that women’s trade policy preferences do not vary as much with their labor
market attributes as men; e.g., an extra year of education does not lower women’s
likelihood to support additional import limits as much as it does for men. Trade
preferences of Democrats and individuals in households with union members are also
relatively insensitive to the skills of an individual, but more sensitive to the task
routineness in their occupation.
The remainder of our paper proceeds as follows. The next section provides a
discussion of the ANES survey data and task routineness data we use, as well as the base
empirical specification. Section 3 presents the paper's empirical results, and section 4
concludes.

6
II. Empirical Specification and Data
From the American National Election Studies (ANES) surveys, we create a
dataset that includes survey years 1986, 1988, 1992, 1996 and 1998.3 In the survey, the
ANES asks the following question:
“Some people have suggested placing new limits on foreign imports in order to
protect American jobs. Others say that such limits would raise consumer prices
and hurt American exports. Do you favor or oppose placing new limits on
imports, or haven't you thought much about this?”
We construct a dependent variable that assigns a “1” when the individual responds that
they favor new limits on imports, and a “0” when they oppose new limits.4 Following
past studies, we estimate a reduced-form specification of the dependent variable as a
linear function of the covariates. We estimate this specification using the ordinary least
squares (OLS) method, as it gives the most ease and flexibility to modify the
specification and interpret marginal effects. However, given the binary nature of our
dependent variable, we have also estimated with a logit specification and note that it
yields qualitatively identical results as OLS throughout our analysis.
Key covariates and base specification follow directly from Scheve and Slaughter
(2001) and Blonigen (2011), using two alternative measures of an individual's skill and
two alternative measures of trade exposure of the industry in which the individual works.
The measures of skill are Education Years and Relative Occupation Wage, while the two
measures of industry trade exposure are Sector Tariff and Sector Net Export Share of
3

These are the only years that are usable for our purposes. In 1990, the ANES survey asked respondents to
rank their preferences for new import limits over a range from 1 to 7, where it is not obvious on how to
correspond these responses into a binary variable in an analogous fashion to the other survey years. We
also exclude the year 2000—the final year the question was asked—because individuals’ county of
residence is not reported in that year's survey, which is needed for some our control variables. See
Blonigen (2011) for more details.
4
This excludes individuals who respond that they haven't thought much about the issue. Scheve and
Slaughter (2001) and Blonigen (2011) find that empirical estimates are qualitatively very similar when one
includes these individuals and employs a sample selection correction.

output (or sales) for a survey respondent's industry of employment. We expect a positive
correlation between tariffs in an individual's employment industry and their preference
for import protection, and a negative correlation between their employment industry's net
export share and their preference for import protection.
Because homes are often an important asset for individuals and home values
depend on economic activity in the immediate location, a secondary focus of Scheve and
Slaughter (2001) is looking at whether homeowners in trade-sensitive locations will be
more likely to prefer trade protections—denoted by a dependent variable for County
Trade Exposure, as well as an interaction variable for whether the individual taking the
survey is a homeowner or not. We control for these variables as well, and also include
other personal and ideological characteristics in our regression specifications, including
age, gender, race, political party affiliation, union membership, and household income
levels. These data come directly from the ANES survey questions and were included in
Blonigen (2011), which describes the construction of all these independent variables in
more detail. Unlike the previous studies, we limit our sample to only those currently in
the workforce or looking for work. Not surprisingly, this tends to strengthen the
influence of the labor market characteristics on individuals’ trade policy preferences.
Our particular focus in this paper is to examine whether task routineness of a
workers’ occupation affects their trade policy preferences. We use the dataset developed
by Autor et al. (2003), which extracts five measures of occupation task attributes from the
U.S. Department of Labor’s Dictionary of Occupational Titles: 1) Setting limits,
tolerances, or standards (Routine Cognitive) 2) finger dexterity (Routine Manual); 3)
Mathematics (Non-routine Analytic); 4) direction, control, and planning of activities

8
(Non-routine Interactive), and 5) eye, hand, and food coordination (Non-routine
Manual).5 We also examine a more summary measure of routineness variable examined
by Autor et al. (2003) and Ebenstein et al. (forthcoming), which we label Routineness and
is calculated by the weighted average:
Routineness = (Routine Cognitive + Routine Manual) / (Routine Cognitive + Routine
Manual + Non-routine Interactive + Non-routine Manual + Non-routine
Analytic).
We concord these data at the 2-digit Census Occupation Code of the individual collected
in the ANES surveys. There are 70 different 2-digit Census Occupation Codes, ranging
from “Extractive Occupations” to “Clerical Supervisors.”6
Table 1 provides summary statistics of all the variables used in this study's
analysis. About 61% of the 4355 individuals in the sample support additional new import
limits. The average individual in the sample has about 1.5 years of school beyond high
school and is around 41 years old. About 35% indicate that their political party is
Democrat, while 29% indicate they are Republicans. Around 66% own their house, 21%
have at least one member in the household who belongs to a labor union and, because of
our focus on those in the workforce, about 62% in the sample are male.
Table 2 provides a matrix of pairwise correlations between the various measures
of an individual’s labor market attributes that we will explore in our analysis below.
These include the industry characteristics (Sector Tariff and Sector Net Export Share) and
skills characteristics (Relative Wages and Education) employed by previous studies, as

We do not include data on codes 71 (Military) or 99 (NA) since military occupations are not able to be
offshored. Our statistical results are unaffected whether we include workers in these categories or not.

9
well as the measures of task routineness that we are introducing to this literature. Out of
45 correlations, only nine have correlations above 0.5 in absolute value and none have a
correlation greater than 0.75. This suggests that these various measures are often
capturing different aspects of an individual’s labor market attributes. The task
routineness measures have generally even lower pairwise correlations with the industry
and skills variables, indicating that task routineness may provide additional information
for explaining individuals’ trade policy preferences.

III. Empirical Results
Our base OLS results are presented in Table 3. The first column of Table 3
presents a specification that follows past literature and does not include any measures of
task routineness. Of the 19 covariates, only seven of them are statistically significant at
the 10% significance level or better. Of the labor market attribute variables, education is
statistically significant at the 1% level and its coefficient indicates that each additional
year of schooling lowers the likelihood that an individual will support additional import
limits by 3.8 percentage points. This fits with the hypothesis that skilled workers’ wages
gain from open trade in a country, such as the United States, that has comparative
advantage in skill-intensive goods. The only other labor market attribute to have some
statistical significance is the tariff in the individual’s sector, with a positive coefficient
indicating that workers’ in more protected industries favor additional import limits. A
standard deviation increase in a sector’s tariff (0.02) means the individual’s likelihood of
supporting additional import limits by 0.9 percentage points – a fairly small marginal

10
effect. The statistical significance of this variable is also not robust to alternative
specifications, as seen in the other columns of Table 3.
A number of ideological/personal attributes of an individual have robust and
strong effects on trade policy preferences in our base results in column 1. Women are
much more likely to support new import limits than men by almost eight percentage
points. This is consistent with findings by other studies, including O’Rourke and Sinnott
(2001), Burgoon and Hiscox (2004), Mayda and Rodrik (2005), Beaulieu and Napier
(2008), and Blonigen (2011). Affiliation with the Democratic party increases the
likelihood of an individual’s support for additional import limits by about 4.5 percentage
points relative to independent and Republican voters, while union membership by
someone in the individual’s household increases the likelihood of support by over 10
percentage points. Interestingly, there are also household income effects even while
controlling for labor market attributes of the individual (including the individual’s wage).
The likelihood that an individual whose household income is in the second lowest income
quartile supports additional import limits is 6.5 percentage points higher than an
individual whose household income is in the highest quartile (the excluded group). In
unreported results, we find that this income effect is statistically significant and similar in
magnitude for individuals in both the lowest and second quartile groups when we include
individuals in the sample who are not in the work force. Thus, lower income is
associated with more support for trade protection, even after controlling labor market
attributes, which is surprising and not accounted for in our standard trade theories.7

7

This point is also made by Mayda and Rodrik (2006), who find a similar income effect on support for
trade protection.

11
In summary, our base results are consistent with the previous literature in finding
only modest support for the effect of labor market attributes on individuals’ trade policy
preferences, while finding strong support for a number of personal/ideological attributes
of the person, including gender, household income, political party, and union affiliation.
Interestingly, there is still much heterogeneity in trade policy preferences remaining to be
explained, as the R2 statistic for the regression is just 0.12.
The main focus of this paper is to examine the effect of including measures of
task routineness, which may be labor market attributes that are more related to how trade
openness affects individuals’ labor market outcomes and, hence, their support or
opposition to more open trade. Column two of Table 3 provides estimates when we
include the five measures of task routineness used by Autor et al. (2003), while column
three of Table 3 instead includes the summary measure of routineness used by others,
including Ebenstein et al. (forthcoming).
The measures of task routineness come in with expected signs, with greater task
routineness associated with increased support for additional import limits, and the
opposite sign for measures of task non-routineness. Most of these task routineness
measures are also statistically and economically significant. Three of the five Autor et al.
(2003) variables are statistically significant at the 5% level and the summary measure
(Routineness) in column 3 is statistically significant at the 1% level. The economic
magnitudes are reasonably significant as well, with a standard deviation leading to a 2-6
percentage point difference in the individual’s likelihood of supporting additional import
limits among the Autor et al. (2003) measures, and a 3 percentage point increase in the

12
likelihood of support for additional import limits for a standard deviation increase in the
summary measure, Routineness, in the column 3 estimates.
In summary, there is substantial evidence that task routineness is important for
understanding individuals’ trade policy preferences independent of their other labor
market attributes. Interestingly, inclusion of the task routineness measures has almost no
impact on the sign and significance of the other included covariates. Education of an
individual continues to be an important determinant, as do the personal/ideological
variables discussed above. Additionally, the R2 statistic of the estimated equation when
including the task routineness measures does not noticeably increase, remaining at 0.12
when rounded to the second digit. Thus, while there is support that task routineness
measures are important, they do not provide a significant change in the explanatory
power of the covariate matrix.

A. Labor market attributes along personal/ideological dimensions
Given the strong effect of a number of key personal/ideological attributes, an
interesting question is the extent to which the effects of labor market attributes on trade
policy preferences differ across these dimensions. Surprisingly, this has not been
previously explored in the literature to our knowledge. In this section, we estimate
differences in labor market attribute effects across gender, political affiliation, and union
affiliation.
Table 4 provides separate estimates of the effect of labor market attributes on
trade policy preferences for males and females in the sample, respectively.8 We use the
8

We estimate these separate effects using the full sample of observations and including a full set of
interactions of the Female variable with all other covariates in the specification.

13
same specification as column 3 of Table 3, but only report the coefficient estimates for
the labor market attributes. The general pattern in these estimates is that labor market
attributes have less effect on trade policy preferences of women. Each year of education
reduces a man’s likelihood of support for additional import limits by 3.9 percentage
points, whereas it only reduces it by 3.0 percentage points for women. (The F-statistic in
column 3 of Table 4 shows that this difference is statistically significant at the 1% level).
In addition, Sector Net Export Share has a significant negative coefficient (as expected)
for males, but is insignificant for women. Likewise, the effect of task routineness on
support for additional import limits is strongly significant for men, but has a coefficient
that is less than half as large and is insignificant for the sample of women. The effect of
Relative Wages and Sector Tariff on trade policy preferences is the same across the two
samples, but both effects are only marginally significant. The effect of Sector Tariff is
relatively small, with a standard deviation increase meaning about a 1.0 percentage point
change in the likelihood of support for additional import limits.
Democratic party and union affiliation are two other personal/ideological
attributes that have strong independent effects on trade policy preferences in our
estimates, so we also examine how these two attributes interact with the labor market
attributes. Table 5 examines whether labor market attributes have different impacts on
trade policy preferences for Democrats versus other party affiliations (Republicans and
independents), while Table 6 does the same for union versus non-union households.
The effect of party affiliation on traditional labor market attributes is quite similar
to the differences across gender. As with women, Democrats’ trade policy preferences
are less affected by traditional labor market attributes. An extra year of education

14
reduces a Democrat’s likelihood of support by only 3.3 percentage points versus 3.9
percentage points for individuals of other political affiliations. In addition, Sector Net
Export Share has a significant negative coefficient (as expected) for Republicans and
independents, but is insignificant for Democrats. In contrast, task routineness has a larger
effect on Democrats’ trade policy preferences than individuals from other party
affiliations. A standard deviation increase in the task routineness of one’s occupation is
associated with an 3.6 percentage point increase in the likelihood that a Democrat will
support additional import limits, while only a 2.6 percentage point increase for
individuals of other political affiliations.
As shown by estimates in Table 6, differences by union affiliation are very similar
to that across political affiliation. Trade policy preferences by individuals in union
households are less sensitive to differences in traditional labor market attributes
(particularly measures of their own skills), but more sensitive to task routineness.

IV. Conclusion and Discussion
This paper provides the first evidence that task routineness of an individual’s
occupation affects their trade policy preferences. Using U.S. survey data, we find that
individuals in occupations that involve more routine tasks are significantly more likely to
support new import limits, even after controlling for other (traditional) labor market and
personal/ideological attributes of the individuals. A standard deviation increase in task
routineness is associated with an additional three-percentage point increase in the
individuals support for trade protection.

15
Personal and ideological attributes have significant effects on trade policy
preferences in our estimates (and in previous literature). And we also provide the first
evidence that there are important interactions between an individual’s
personal/ideological attributes and their labor market attributes. We find that that
women’s trade policy preferences do not vary as much with their labor market attributes
as men; e.g., an extra year of education does not lower women’s likelihood to support
additional import limits as much as it does for men. Trade preferences of Democrats and
individuals in households with union members are also relatively insensitive to the skills
of an individual, but more sensitive to the task routineness in their occupation.
While we have uncovered evidence that labor market attributes impact trade
policy preferences, it is important to note that there is still substantial unexplained
variation in individuals’ trade policy preferences. The R2 statistics in our regressions
range from 0.12 to 0.13. The R2 of a regression that only includes traditional labor
market attributes (where education is the primary variable) is around 0.06, while a
regression with only task routineness measures is approximately 0.04. When we put in
industry-by-occupation fixed effects, which subsumes all our labor market attribute
variables, but then also accounts for any other unobserved effects connected with an
individual’s particular industry and occupation, we achieve an R2 of approximately 0.30.
Thus, there is clearly room for further research into the exact ways in which labor market
attributes affect trade policy preferences, but this evidence also suggests that individuals’
stated trade policy preferences are significantly affected by factors other than ones related
to how trade affects their own labor market outcomes.
