As they reorient work flows, financial firms are simultaneously restructuring their organizations to lower net burdens from government regulation. Alternative state and federal regulatory and legislative bodies compete vigorously for the regulatory business of developing institutional hybrids. Evolution of Federal Reserve policy toward \"nonbank banks\" exemplifies the process.\n\n",
