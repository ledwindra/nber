The Sad Truth About Happiness Scales
Timothy N. Bond and Kevin Lang
NBER Working Paper No. 19950
March 2014
JEL No. D6,I3,N3
ABSTRACT
We show that, without strong auxiliary assumptions, it is impossible to rank groups by average
happiness using survey data with a few potential responses. The categories represent intervals along
some continuous distribution. The implied CDFs of these distributions will (almost) always cross
when estimated using large samples. Therefore some monotonic transformation of the utility function
will reverse the ranking. We provide several examples and a formal proof. Whether Moving-toOpportunity increases happiness, men have become happier relative to women, and an Easterlin
paradox exists depends on whether happiness is distributed normally or log-normally. We discuss
restrictions that may permit such comparisons.

Introduction

There is an extensive literature that relies on questions in which individuals are asked to
report their happiness in a few ordered categories such as “very happy,” “pretty happy” or
“not too happy.”We argue that with such scales it is essentially never possible to rank the
overall happiness of two groups without strong auxiliary assumptions. Consequently, it is
impossible to use such data to make scienti…cally valid statements of the form “people in
country A are, on average, happier than people in country B” or that “married men are
happier than single men”unless we believe that we know a great deal about the underlying
distribution of happiness.
Our argument is simple. When placing themselves on a happiness scale that consists of
a small number of points, people place their happiness or utility in a range.1 For example,
they describe themselves as “very happy”if their utility exceeds some critical value. Oswald
(2008) refers to this as the reporting function. Any comparison of two groups presumes that
the cuto¤s for the groups are identical. If not, comparing the groups would be tantamount
to declaring group A happier than group B because the proportion of As declaring themselves “quite happy”was greater than the proportion of Bs declaring themselves “ecstatically
happy.”
If, for example, we have a scale with three categories (two cuto¤s), we can, without
apparent loss of generality, normalize the cuto¤s to be 0 and 1: Given some belief about
the full underlying distribution, such as that it is logistic or normal, we can estimate two
parameters (e.g. the mean and variance) of the distribution from the distribution of the
responses across categories.
Since we can calculate the mean, it might appear that we can compare average happiness.
However, just as monotonic transformations of the utility function do not change choices
under a revealed preference model of utility, monotonic transformations do not alter the
category into which expressed utility or happiness falls. Therefore, unless the distribution
of responses across categories enables us to conclude that one underlying distribution is
greater than the other in the sense of …rst-order stochastic dominance, we cannot order the
means. However, we will not be able to establish …rst-order stochastic dominance of the
underlying distributions unless the estimated variances are identical, which is an essentially
zero-probability event. Moreover, even if our estimates of the variance are identical, since
1

There is a literature (e.g. Frey and Stutzer, 2000) that distinguishes between utility as measured by
revealed preference and happiness as reported in surveys. We view the underlying concepts as the same.
Whether happiness or utility should be measured by revealed preference/willingness to pay or self-reports is
a separate issues. Our point is merely that regardless of how utility or happiness is elicited, we cannot know
more than the ranking of happiness.

1

both are merely estimates subject to error, our posterior that they are identical must still
be 0.
Our argument is related to Oswald’s discussion of the reporting function. In an interesting
experiment, he asks subjects to report their height on a continuous scale from 0 to 10. He
…nds that when the sample is split by sex, the response on the scale is roughly linear in actual
height. There is, of course, between respondent variation, but we will mostly abstract from
between person di¤erences in the reporting function in what follows. Instead, we argue that
there is a fundamental di¤erence between height and happiness. The underlying variable
height is measured on an interval scale. Regardless of whether the respondent uses metric
or imperial measures, the reporting function will have the same shape. But happiness is
ordinal. It is as if we could not agree whether height should be measured in centimeters, the
log of centimeters or the exponential of centimeters.
In principle, this problem can be solved if we are willing to tie the happiness scale to
some outcome measure. Bond and Lang (2014) develop interval measures of achievement by
tying test scores to eventual completed education and to the associated expected wages. But
as the parallel with their analysis of test scores shows, the conclusions we reach may depend
on whether we relate the underlying happiness measure to the probability of committing
suicide or some other outcome. Moreover it is not clear to us why in this case we would
not prefer to measure the related outcomes directly. As discussed in section four, regardless
of the concerns we raise about the measurement of happiness, the evidence is strong that
Moving to Opportunity reduced symptoms of depression and improved other measures of
psychological well-being.
The alternative approach, which is the one we will emphasize, is to place restrictions
on the distribution of happiness in the population. However, this, too, raises di¢ culties.
Our beliefs about what distributions are plausible are likely to depend on our beliefs about,
among other things, the marginal utility of income. Yet, the relation between happiness and
income is one of the key areas of debate in happiness research.
In the next section, we present a series of simple examples. We show …rst that even
if happiness is normally distributed, shifting respondents from “not too happy” to “pretty
happy” can lower our estimate of average happiness. We then provide an example which
appears to avoid this problem: the distribution of responses over the three categories is higher
in the sense of …rst-order stochastic dominance, and estimated mean utility for the group
with more positive responses is higher. However, at one point in the utility distribution,
a substantial minority of the second group has higher utility than the members in the …rst
group. A simple monotonic transformation of the utility function (or happiness distribution)
…ts the data equally well but reverses the comparison of mean utilities. Finally, we further
2

show that when mean happiness is estimated assuming happiness is normally distributed, a
common implicit assumption, one of two simple exponential transformations can reverse any
reported happiness gap.
In the third section we prove our main result: it is (almost) never possible to rank the
mean happiness of two groups when the data are reported on a discrete ordinal scale. We
apply this result, in section four, to three …ndings from the happiness literature: the e¤ect
of Moving to Opportunity on happiness (Ludwig et. al, 2013); the decline in the relative
happiness of women despite the dramatic progress they have made economically and socially
since the 1970s (Stevenson and Wolfers, 2009), and the Easterlin paradox (Easterlin, 1973).
We also investigate the impact of di¤erent distributional assumptions on comparisons more
generally, by looking at the rank order of mean happiness by country. In the …fth and …nal
section we discuss whether it is possible to weaken our result. We conclude that we can do
so only under (perhaps overly) strong assumptions although we hold out some hope for a
consensus on plausible restrictions on the happiness distribution which would permit strong
conclusions in some cases.

Some Simple Examples

Suppose we ask a large number of people belonging to two groups to assess their happiness
on a 3-point scale, and they respond as shown in example 1.
Example 1
Group A Group B
Very happy
Pretty happy
Not too happy

20
25
55

15
30
55

The responses in group A are higher than those in group B in the sense of …rst-order
stochastic dominance so that regardless of the values assigned to the three categories, two of
which are in any event mere normalizations, group A will have higher average happiness than
group B does.2 However, increasingly researchers recognize that the three categories capture
2

We focus on what we view as the more sophisticated approach in this literature which views these
categories as capturing three parts of a continuum. We note, however, that is common for researchers to
assign the values 0, 1 and 2 to the three categories, in which case, group A would have mean happiness .65
while group B would have mean happiness of only .6. Alternatively, they may perform a linear transformation
by subtracting by the mean and dividing by the variance. This has no substantive impact on the results.
These approaches assume that the three points on the scale represent known points on an interval scale,

3

a continuum. Therefore they are likely to estimate underlying happiness using ordered logit
or probit. For a normal distribution of happiness with mean
and standard deviation
, textbook ordered probit will estimate = . Di¤erent computer packages use somewhat
di¤erent normalizations to identify the model. We will use Stata which sets the constant term
equal to zero and the variance to 1. Stata informs us that group B is .07 standard deviations
less happy than group A if we use ordered probit. and about .08 standard deviations less
happy if we use ordered logit.
But this conclusion is problematic because it assumes that the distribution of happiness
di¤ers between the two groups only through a shift in the mean. It is highly unlikely
that a shift in the mean would induce only a shift between the top two categories and
not one between the bottom two categories. Indeed this cannot happen with either the
normal or logistic distribution. If there were roughly 400 observations in each group, a
maximum likelihood estimator for either a normal or logistic distribution would reject the
null hypothesis that the distributions di¤er only due to a shift in their mean.
Of course, we could estimate the ordered probit or logit separately for the two groups,
but this makes it di¢ cult to interpret the di¤erence. When estimated on a single group with
no explanatory variables, normalizing the constant to 0; as in Stata, sets the mean equal
to 0. Therefore, we cannot …nd a di¤erence in mean happiness between the two groups.
Instead, we would conclude that for some unfathomable reason, members of group B declare
themselves very happy only when their happiness exceeds 1.04 standard deviations above
the mean while members of group A are very happy as long as their happiness exceeds .84
standard deviations above the mean although both groups declare themselves not too happy
if their happiness is less than .13 deviations above the mean.
Needless to say, this is an unsatisfactory conclusion. The normalizations rule out di¤erences in the true distributions of happiness, the very phenomenon we are trying to investigate.
A more reasonable assumption is that the members of groups A and B de…ne the categories
of happiness similarly but have both di¤erent means and standard deviations of happiness.
Without loss of generality (under the normality assumption), we set the cuto¤ between “not
too happy” and “pretty happy” to 0 and the cuto¤ between the latter category and “very
happy”to 1.
which, it will be clear we view as incorrect. There are even cases where such scales have been treated as
ratio scales: “... the data revealed that those making $55,000 were just 9 percent more satis…ed than those
making $25,000.” (Dunn and Norton, 2013, p. xiv)

Given normality, we solve

(2)

for group A and similarly for group B except that we replace :80 with :85:
We …nd that average utility is actually lower for group A at :18 than for group B which
has average utility :14:3
To gain some intuition into this seemingly perverse result, consider a more extreme
situation portrayed in example 2. In this case in both groups 55% are “not too happy”but
the remaining 45% of group A are “very happy” whereas their counterparts in group B are
only “pretty happy.”Given a normal distribution, the only way for no one to have happiness
between 0 and 1 is for the variance to be in…nite. With more observations to the left of 0
than to the right of it, as variance goes to in…nity, mean utility goes to minus in…nity. So, on
average, group A is in…nitely unhappy. In contrast, when nobody reports being “very happy,”
the variance must be near zero. As the variance goes to zero, all observations are clustered
very close to zero. Even though somewhat more people …nd themselves with happiness just
below zero than just above it, they are all so close to zero that mean happiness among group
B is also very close to zero.

As the example may suggest, and it is straightforward to show, with the normal and
logistic distributions, perverse examples arise when the median response lies at one of the
extremes. In the happiness data for the United States, the median generally lies in the middle
category. However, the normal and logistic distributions are both symmetric distributions.
Asymmetric distributions can produce di¤erent results.
Even if estimated mean happiness changes in the same direction as the movement among
categories, it will rarely be the case that the distributions of happiness can be ranked in the
sense of …rst-order stochastic dominance. Consider example 3. Again group B appears to
3

For the logistic distribution the means are -.17 and -.13.

5

be happier than group A. But let us assume that happiness is logistically distributed and
normalize the cuto¤s to 0 and 1 as before. Now our estimate of mean happiness for group
B (:61) is indeed above the estimated mean for group A (:50) ; but the spread coe¢ cient is
also larger (:42 v :36) so that the happiness distributions cross at the 14th percentile. The
results if we instead assume that happiness is normally distributed are similar.

At …rst blush this may not seem problematic. Although neither group is happier in the
sense of …rst-order stochastic dominance, we can still say, using either distribution, that
group B is happier on average. Unfortunately, this conclusion relies on the assumption
that we know the true distribution. Any monotonic transformation of the utility function
is also a legitimate utility function. And given that the distributions cross, we can always
de…ne a new utility function/happiness distribution that …ts the data equally well and for
which the conclusion about mean utility is reversed. In example 3, starting from the normal
distribution, we can rede…ne all utilities below -.163 to be
u = c (u + :163)

:163:

(3)

For c su¢ ciently positive, the estimates of average utility will be reversed.
In fact, perverse examples can even come from standard distributions. Suppose that we
used ordinal data to estimate an underlying happiness distribution assuming normality. If we
normalize the cut-points to 0 and 1, we will obtain a parameter for the mean, ; and standard
deviation, . Suppose we instead estimated a log-normal distribution, by transforming the
utilities by eX . Our new mean is
2
e +:5
If we are comparing two groups, one of which has a higher mean and the other a higher
variance, this transformation alone could reverse the ranking obtained by the normal distribution. If not, we can raise the cut-point from 1 to c. This is equivalent to multiplying our
data by c and thus would have no impact on the direction of the gaps when we estimate
with the normal. However, the mean under the log-normal transformation becomes
= ec
6

+:5c2

2

(4)

There then will always be a c large enough to reverse the ranking.
What if one group has both a higher mean and higher variance when estimated normally?
We can then transform the data by e cX to be left-skewed log-normal. The mean of
happiness becomes
2 2
= e c +:5c
(5)
which is decreasing in . Thus there must be some c that will reverse the gap. It should
be noted that in both cases these are just simple monotonic transformations of the utility
function. Since happiness is ordinal, these transformations represent the responses equally
well.4
There is a risk that our criticism will be confused with one that is trite. It is, of course,
possible to argue that even though a lower proportion of group A than of group B is very
happy, the As in this group are much happier than the Bs or that the unhappy Bs are much
more unhappy than the unhappy As. But our argument is di¤erent. The allocation of the
responses across the three categories strongly suggests that the variance of utility di¤ers
between the two groups. Therefore, one of the above possibilities should be recognized as
highly likely.
Our focus is on reversals in the estimation of means. However, there is a small but growing
literature discussed below that analyzes the dispersion of happiness. It is straightforward
to generate plausible examples in which di¤erent assumptions about the distribution of
happiness lead to di¤erent conclusions about relative variances. However, we make no claim
that there is always an easy transformation that generates such a reversal.
Finally, we note that the examples do not require that utility be unbounded. Even
if we believed that utility is uniformly distributed over some range, in all three examples
the cumulative distributions of the utilities of the two groups would cross. However, with
bounded utility, it is also possible to construct generic examples where the cdfs do not cross.

The General Argument

Assumption 1 Utility u is unbounded.
Assumption 2 The cumulative distribution function F (u) is continuous with F 0 (u) > 0:
Assumption 3 The cumulative distribution function can be written as a function of (u m) =s
where u is the utility level, m is a measure of central tendency and s is a measure of spread.
4

It is worth noting that our analysis stands in sharp contrast with Hammond, Liberini and Proto (2011)
who accept Pareto superiority as a normative principle but view stochastic dominance of subjective well-being
as reported in categories as a necessary and su¢ cient condition for Pareto superiority.

7

In the case of the normal, m is the mean, s is the standard deviation. For the Cauchy
distribution m is the median or mode, and s is a transformation of the entropy. Of course,
in the case of the Cauchy distribution, it would not be meaningful to try to estimate mean
utility. While not all distributions satisfying assumptions 1 and 2 will also satisfy assumption
3, depending on how one de…nes “standard,” most or all standard distributions do. These
include the extreme value, logistic (including generalized logistic if the auxiliary parameters
are held constant) and Laplace.
These three assumptions are su¢ cient to ensure the absence of …rst-order stochastic
dominance except in a knife-edge case.
Proposition 1 Under assumptions 1-3, if the happiness or utility of two groups is drawn
from the same distribution except for the values of m and s, the cumulative distribution
functions of utility for the groups cross at 1 < u < 1 unless s is identical for the two
groups.
Proof.
u =

where 1 and 2 denote the two groups, which is …nite for s1 6= s2 :
Remark 1 Assumption 3 can be replaced with other assumptions. For example, if both
distributions are symmetric, then one will have lower density at both 1 which is su¢ cient
to ensure that …rst-order stochastic dominance fails.
Remark 2 Stochastic dominance can exist in three parameter models. If, for example,

; there are values of the parameters such that Fa (x)

Fb (x) ; 8x:

However, in general, even with four or more ordinal categories of response, three-parameter
models cannot be estimated without additional restrictions that go beyond normalizations.
We are now in a position to prove the major result of this paper.
Theorem 1 Let F u s1m1 and F u s2m2 be the estimated cumulative distribution functions
from categorical data on happiness. Then there is a transformation of the utility function
that …ts the data equally well but that reverses the ranking of the mean utilities.

Finally, we note that since the ordinal responses are reported in categories, in …nite
samples, depending on the number of observations from each group, there can be a positive
probability that the estimated s will be the same for two independent samples. However, as
the sample gets large, this probability gets small.

This remark follows from the standard properties of maximum-likelihood estimators. It

This, in turn, leads to our main result.
Conclusion 1 If happiness (or utility) is reported using a discrete ordinal scale, in large
samples it will (almost) never be possible to rank the mean happiness of two groups without
additional restrictions on the nature of the happiness distribution.5

Empirical Applications
Moving to Opportunity

Economists have long postulated that living in a poor neighborhood may make it more
di¢ cult to escape poverty. Motivated by this idea and the positive results of the Gautreaux
desegregation program in Chicago,6 the Moving-to-Opportunity experiment targeted families
living in public housing in high poverty areas. Eligible families were invited to apply for the
chance to receive a Section 8 housing (rental assistance) voucher. Applicants were randomly
assigned into three groups: no voucher (Control group), Section 8 voucher that could only
be used in an area with a poverty rate below 10% (Experimental group), and a standard
Section 8 voucher (Section 8 group).
The program has been assessed at multiple stages.7 A long-term follow-up (Ludwig et al,
2012, 2013) emphasizes that subjects in the experimental group were substantially happier
than those in the control group. We reexamine the evidence for this conclusion.
The participants in the long-term MTO evaluation study were asked “Taken all together,
how would you say things are these days – would you say that you are very happy, pretty
happy, or not too happy?” The authors focus on the e¤ect on the distribution of responses
across categories. Nothing we write below can or will contradict the …nding that MTO
increases the proportion of individuals who report that they are “very happy” and reduces
the proportion who say they are “not too happy.”If these are the socially relevant categories,
5
The intuition behind this is relatively straightforward. Needless to say, if the true variances are not
equal, then asymptotically the probability that the estimates di¤er by less than " goes to 0 as the samples
become large. Suppose, however, that sA = sB = s: Then sbA !d N s; 2A and sbB !d N s; 2B :
De…ne = sbA sbB : Then since sbA and sbB are asymptotically independent normals, !d N 0; 2 where

The Gautreaux program came out of a court-ordered desegration program in Chicago in the 1970s. See
Rosenbaum (1995) for a detailed analysis.

then there is no need to estimate a mean, or any other single summary measure of happiness.
Thus, for example, we might believe that people are “not depressed,”“mildly depressed”or
“severely depressed”and view variation in depression within these categories as unimportant.
We take no position on the accuracy of this view of depression, but if we accept it, an
intervention that reduces the proportion of severely and mildly depressed individuals reduces
depression since variation in depression within categories is unimportant. We return to this
point in our conclusions.
However, we believe that happiness should be viewed as continuous. Therefore, statements about mean happiness and not just the frequency of responses within categories are
potentially relevant. Ludwig et al (2012, table S4) report intent-to-treat estimates on the
experimental group using intervals of 1 unit between the categories, as is common in the
literature, but also ordered probit and logit. For purposes of comparison with the literature,
Ludwig et al not only show the e¤ects on the distribution of responses but also consider the
case where they assign values of 3, 2, and 1 to the three responses. In all three cases, they
…nd positive e¤ects on average happiness that fall just short of signi…cance at the .05 level.
If we believed that happiness is normally distributed, normalizing the cuto¤s to 0 and 1,
we would …nd that the control group does have a lower mean (.44 v. .60). But, the control
group also has a higher variance (.79 vs .63). The cdfs cross at the 83rd percentile, which
is 1.20 units of happiness (and also in the extreme left tail of the distributions). Thus if we
simply de…ne a new utility function which increases the values of happiness above 1.20 we
can reverse the mean happiness. This utility function would explain the data equally well.
Alternatively, we can perform an exponential transformation to get a log-normal distribution of happiness. Keeping our underlying cut-points …xed at 0 and 1, the exponential
transformation will still show that the experimental group (2.22) is happier than the control
group (2.14). But, as discussed in section 2, since the control group has a higher variance of
happiness, we can raise their mean relative to the experimental group by raising the cut-point
between pretty happy and very happy. If we raise our cut point to 1:33, or equivalently raise
each individual’s happiness to the 1:33rd power after performing the exponential transformation, the mean utilities of the two groups are equal. As we show in …gure 1, this amounts
to a somewhat right-skewed distribution of happiness, meaning the di¤erences among the
happiest individuals are greater than the di¤erences among the least happy. This utility
function is just a monotonic transformation of the one underlying the normal distribution
and thus …ts the data equally well. Therefore, we cannot determine whether the causal e¤ect
of MTO on happiness is positive on average. One plausible interpretation of the data is that
moving to a low poverty area reduced both the probability of being extremely unhappy and
extremely happy.
11

One solution to this indeterminacy is to tie our assessment of (un)happiness to some
other outcome variable. This is the approach we use in Bond and Lang (2014) where we
scale test scores in a given grade by the eventual educational attainment of students with
those test scores. The limited number of points on the happiness scale makes this di¢ cult.
This discreteness may be missing variation within the categories that represents important
distinctions in happiness. But, compared with variation at the high end of the scale, variation
in happiness at the low end of the scale might prove to be more closely correlated with other
signs of psychological distress, which were also shown in Ludwig et al to be bene…cially
in‡uenced by moving to a neighborhood with a lower poverty rate.
Thus, in settings where we do not have direct measures of psychological well-being, it
may be possible, we are agnostic on this point, to use data from other settings such as
MTO to scale happiness in a more compelling way. For MTO, the strongest evidence of
positive psychological bene…ts comes from direct measures of the prevalence of psychological
problems. Provided that these conditions are discrete rather than continuous, our concerns
about happiness scales do not apply to such things as measures of depression.

The Paradox of Declining Female Happiness

One surprising result from the happiness literature, documented by Stevenson and Wolfers
(2009), is that women’s happiness appears to have fallen relative to men’s from 1972-2006
despite the great social and economic progress women made during this period. Again, this
result is easily reversed.
We use the publicly available …le created by Stevenson and Wolfers from the General
Social Survey (GSS), a nationally representative survey of social attitudes conducted annually or biennially since 1972. The GSS assesses subjective well being using responses to the
question later adopted in the MTO study. While the question remains constant over time,
its position in the survey does not, which could lead to biases in responses in di¤erent years.8
Stevenson and Wolfers use split-ballot experiments to modify the data to account for these
di¤erences.9
To simplify the analysis and ease exposition, we create two subgroups: those from the
…rst …ve surveys (1972-1976) and those from the last …ve surveys (1998-2006) but can obtain similar results using the full time series. We display the distribution of happiness in
these groups in Table 2. Using ordered probit, Stevenson and Wolfers found that women
8
For example, Stevenson and Wolfers (2009) note that in every year but 1972, the question followed a
question on marital happiness, which may cause di¤erences in the impact of one’s marriage on his or her
response to the general happiness assessment. See Smith (1990).

lost ground to men at the rate of .376 standard deviations per century. We con…rm this
result between the two subgroups; ordered probit estimates that women were .09 standard
deviations less happy relative to men in the later sample than the early.
However, as discussed previously, ordered probit assumes that the variance of happiness
is constant across sex and over time, an assumption we can easily reject. When we allow the
variances to di¤er, we …nd women’s happiness has more variance than men’s and that the
variance of happiness has declined over time. This is what one would expect from looking
at the data. Most of the di¤erences between the sexes and over time are due to there being
more “very happy”women in the early years. When more people are “very happy”but there
is no di¤erence in the number “not too happy” the distribution must have higher variance
to …t the data. Relaxing the constant variance assumption lowers the growth of the gap to
.07.
Now, we transform the utility function by
u
e=

e

Cu

(8)

so that the distribution of happiness is given by the left-skewed log normal distribution.
Since their utility distribution has the highest variance under the normality assumption,
choosing a C su¢ ciently large lowers the mean utility of women in the early period by more
than it does men’s. As we show in in Figure 2, for C 3:9 women become happier over time
relative to men, as one might expect given their social progress in the period. Large values
of C will show large increases in relative female happiness.
Admittedly, when C = 3:9; the distribution is fairly skewed. This implies that utility
di¤erences among the unhappiest people are far greater than di¤erences among the happiest.
All happy people have happiness between 0:02 and 0, while 5% of the distribution has
happiness below 250. Of course, this distribution …ts the data just as well as the normal.
From the data alone it is di¢ cult to argue that one utility distribution is clearly more
plausible.
Further, this is just one scale and distribution based on a simple transformation under
which women gain happiness relative to men. There are an in…nite number of others, and
more complex transformations may create distributions that are more intuitively appealing.
Ultimately if we can gain consensus about plausible restrictions on the happiness distribution
(e.g. skewness, kurtosis) or at least a reasonable loss function involving these moments, it
may be possible in some cases to conclude that no plausible transformation will reverse a
particular …nding.

Easterlin Paradox

No question in the happiness literature has received more attention than the “Easterlin
Paradox,” the observation that in some settings higher incomes do not appear correlated
with higher levels of happiness. Easterlin (1973, 1974) found that income and subjective
well-being assessments were strongly and positively correlated within a country in a given
year, but not over time and across countries. This, and subsequent studies, led Easterlin
(1994) to conclude, “Will raising the incomes of all increase the happiness of all? The answer
to this question can now be given with somewhat greater assurance than twenty years ago. It
is ‘no’.”Easterlin instead concludes that the weight of the evidence supports the conclusion
that individuals judge their happiness relative to their peers and not on an absolute scale.
The paradox was recently called into question in a comprehensive study by Stevenson
and Wolfers (2008a).10 They use ordered probit both across countries and over time within
countries and …nd a strong relation between happiness and economic development. However,
they …nd that the United States is an exception. Happiness has not increased despite substantial growth in per capita incomes. They attribute this to the substantial rise in income
inequality over the last 30 years which occurred simultaneously with the rise in real GDP.
We match the GSS data from Stevenson and Wolfers (2009) with U.S. per capita real
disposable income data from the 2013 Economic Report of the President to get a time series
of national happiness and income data. Fixing the cut-points to 0 and 1, we estimate the
two parameters of a normal distribution for each year using the GSS and regress the means
on per capita disposable income. As we show in Figure 3, we do indeed …nd an Easterlin
Paradox. Ordinary Least Squares estimates imply that a $10,000 per capita increase in real
disposable income is actually associated with a decrease in happiness in the United States
of .02 units, although, with a p-value of only .11, it is not statistically signi…cant.
However, …gure 4 shows that we also estimate a strong negative relation between real per
capita disposable income and the variance of happiness. A $10,000 increase in per capita
income is associated with a statistically signi…cant .04 unit decrease in the standard deviation
of happiness. This may be somewhat surprising given the increase in income inequality over
the time period, but is what one would expect from the data and has been demonstrated
previously by Stevenson and Wolfers (2008b) and Dutta and Foster (2013).11 As real income
has increased, fewer people report being very happy, but there is a zero to slightly negative
change in the number of people who report being not too happy.
10

See also Deaton (2008) who …nds similar results from the Gallup World Poll using OLS on a basic
10-point scale.
11
Clark, Fleche and Senik (2014, forthcoming) argue that this is a standard pattern – growth reduces
happiness inequality.

14

Since high-income periods have a lower mean and variance than low-income periods,
we know that a left-skewed log normal distribution will reverse the trend. In fact, we do
not need to skew the distribution that much. For values of C
:45 we …nd the expected
positive relationship between income and happiness. In Figure 5, we show the distribution
of happiness under this set of parameters in 2006. Here the cut-point values of happiness
would be 1 to go from not too happy to pretty happy and :64 to go from pretty happy
to very happy. There is variation among the happiest and least happy individuals, although
more so among the latter given the skewness of the distribution.
For C > 2, this positive relationship becomes statistically signi…cant. We plot the C =
2:05 case in Figure 6. Here, a $10,000 increase in real per capita disposable income is
associated with a :22 unit increase in happiness. If we are willing to accept this amount
of skewness in the happiness distribution, then raising the incomes of all does not raise
the happiness of all but does raise average happiness. There are other distributions and
transformations that replicate this result; there is no way to determine from the data which
utility function is correct.
As in the case of MTO, if we are convinced that the response categories in the survey are
the ones that are relevant for policy purposes, we can avoid this problem. However, unlike
the case of the female happiness paradox where it might be possible to conclude that no
plausible happiness distribution would reverse the result, it is evident that plausible (at least
to us) distributions can reverse the basic …nding.

4.4

Cross-Country Comparisons

In the previous sections, we found that three conclusions based on normally-distributed happiness assumptions could be reversed by simple log-normal transformations. In this subsection we explore the sensitivity of happiness comparisons to such transformations in general.
Using data from the World Values Survey, we estimate mean happiness at the country level
for a normal distribution, as well as a log-normal distribution with C = 2; :5; :5; and 2.12
The ordering of countries in Table 3 represents their happiness ranking when happiness
is distributed normally, and the columns list their ranking under the di¤erent log-normal
transformations. Although the actual degree of skewness varies across countries due to
di¤erences in the variance of the underlying normal distribution, moving from left to right
in the columns represents moving from a relatively right-skewed to a relatively left-skewed
12
In contrast with the other data we use, the World Values Survey elicits happiness responses on a 4-value
scale: not at all happy, not very happy, quite happy, and very happy. Because the fraction of not at all
happy responses is almost universally trivial, we combine these responses with those of not very happy to
get a 3-point scale. This allows us to follow the same approach as in the previous three subsections.

15

distribution. Doing so has dramatic e¤ects on the rank-ordering of happiness. The …ve
happiest countries when happiness is right-skewed are Ghana, Guatemala, Mexico, Trinidad
and Tobago, and South Africa. Three of these countries rank in the bottom ten when
happiness is left-skewed, and only one (Mexico) ranks in the upper half. The top …ve under
the extreme left-skewed distribution of happiness (New Zealand, Sweden, Canada, Norway,
and Great Britain) fare relatively better under right-skewed happiness, though only Great
Britain remains in the top ten. The rank-correlation between the log-normal transformations
with C = 2 and C = 2 is :156.
There are some countries whose rank remains fairly stable throughout the distribution.
Great Britain is the third happiest country under a normal distribution and has its rank vary
between 2 and 8 under the skewed distributions. Moldova, the world’s least happy country
under the normal distribution, is never able to rise above 4th worst in the skewed transformations. These cases are counterbalanced by countries like Ghana and Ethiopia. Ghana ranges
from the world’s happiest to the world’s 3rd least happy depending on whether happiness is
right- or left-skewed. Ethiopia, the 10th least happy under the normal distribution, is able
to rise as high as 7th when happiness is right-skewed, placing it above the United States,
Australia, and Great Britain, among others.
The wide variation in ranking suggests that in most cases the amount of skewness allowed
in the distribution can have substantial impacts on cross-group comparisons. Even the most
skewed-distributions we explored here are not, to us, implausible. They involve a smaller
exponential transformation than required to have a signi…cant and positive relationship between average happiness and per capita income over time in the United States (see …gure 5).
We do …nd the ranking under the left-skewed distribution to be more in-line with our priors
than the right-skew or the normal, though we stress there is nothing in the happiness data
itself that would allow us to choose among the distributions. Interestingly, the right-skewed
distributions would imply a strong negative correlation between per capita GDP, while the
left-skewed implies a strong positive relation.13

Discussion and Conclusions

As we have demonstrated, key conclusions of happiness studies depend on assumptions about
the underlying distribution of happiness, something about which the data can give us little
or no guidance. Since the estimated cdfs (almost) always cross when we assume a particular
13

Using 2005 data from the IMF on purchasing power parity equivalent per capita GDP, the coe¢ cient
on a regression of estimated mean happiness and the natural logarithm of per capita GDP is -4.79 for the
right-skewed (C = 2) distribution and .60 for the left-skewed distribution (C = 2).

16

distribution of utility, there is always some transformation that preserves the rank order of
individuals and changes the direction of the estimated gap in mean happiness.
Is there any way to create compelling cross-group comparisons?
Perhaps the simplest assumption one could make is to assume that we know the policyrelevant distribution of happiness. For instance, if we believe happiness is distributed normally, we can …x the cut-points between "not too happy", "pretty happy", and "very happy"
and estimate the means and variances of each group through ordered probit.
It should be clear that the choice of a particular distribution almost inevitably implies
taking a stand on some of the very issues that have been the focus of the happiness literature. Thus since wealth and income are highly skewed, a normal distribution of happiness
would almost necessarily require the marginal utility of wealth or income to be sharply diminishing. We do not, however, rule out the possibility that the profession could achieve
near consensus on some reasonable restrictions on the happiness distribution and that these
restrictions would be adequate to allow us to reach strong conclusions about the ranking of
mean happiness in some cases.
Of course, there are di¢ culties even if we can rank means. Unless we are very traditional
utilitarians who wish to maximize the sum of utilities, we will still encounter problems for
policy purposes. We may, many philosophers would argue should, care more about increases
in utility at some parts if the distribution than at others. In this case, the Bond and Lang
(2013) criticism of test scores applies directly.
An alternative solution is to declare the ordinal scale on which people report their happiness to be the policy-relevant one. Group A is happier than group B if its members
responses “stochastically dominate”B’s using the categories provided in the question about
self-assessed happiness. This approach has a great deal of intuitive appeal, and we confess
that in some cases we are inclined to accept it. However, it is trivial to …nd examples where,
using what appears to be a sensible partition of the data into three categories, groups appear
to be ordered in the sense of stochastic dominance, but for which the means have the reverse order when the full underlying distribution is examined. For example, there are many
occupations (e.g. actors) in which mean income is relatively high but most people in the
occupation have very low incomes. Other occupations have high variance but also relatively
low mean wages. When stochastic dominance fails using the full underlying distribution, it
is possible to group wages (or other variables) so that using the grouped data, stochastic
dominance appears to hold.
Of course, as the number of response categories becomes large, it becomes less plausible
that a …ner grid would reverse the conclusion that the group that appears to be happier in
the sense of stochastic dominance has higher mean happiness. In the experiment described
17

earlier, Oswald asked participants to report their height on a continuous scale from 0 to
10. Assuming that there are no responses at the extreme, if all respondents use the same
reporting function, then stochastic dominance is su¢ cient to ensure that the ranking of the
means is independent of scale. It seems to us likely that if individual di¤erences in the
reporting function are independent of group membership, …rst order stochastic dominance
will still be su¢ cient to rank means. However, we note that Oswald …nds evidence that
men and women use di¤erent reporting functions when converting their height to his scale.
It is also not evident that repeated observations on the same individuals will address the
problem of heterogeneity in the response function. In addition to the well-known problems
associated with estimating …xed e¤ects with ordinal data, it is not clear that we expect
individual reporting functions to be stable over time. For example, in repeated cross-sections,
immigrants show no improvement in their host-country language skills, but they report
improvement when asked to compare their current and earlier language skills (Berman, Lang
and Siniver, 2003).
One solution when working with ordinal scales is to relate them to some measurable outcome. In the traditional economics literature, we measure the utility of a good or outcome by
willingness to pay, imperfectly captured by the equivalent or compensating variation. The
happiness literature has called this approach into question and with it some basic assumptions, such as positive marginal utility of money. Invoking a monetary scale thus brings us
to a Catch-22. We cannot answer the main questions of the happiness literature using the
most obvious tool because the literature seeks to invalidate that very tool.
Finally, we note that our examples require di¤erent transformations to reverse the results
in the literature. We showed that moving to a low poverty area reduces mean happiness if
happiness is log normally distributed and strongly right skewed. But the Easterlin paradox
is resolved for the United States if happiness follows a su¢ ciently left-skewed log normal
distribution. It is not obvious that there is an assumption about the distribution that
would reverse both results. It may be that we can reach su¢ cient consensus about which
distributions are acceptable that we can make de…nitive statements in some cases.
One possibility is what we call the “Tolstoy assumption,”that there is far greater variation
in unhappiness than in happiness.14 In other words, happiness is left skewed. In this case,
it is very likely that MTO did raise happiness for those who moved to less impoverished
areas. This is consistent with the standard assumption that expanding the choice set of
rational agents should never ex ante decrease utility. But before drawing strong conclusions,
we should be explicit about the requisite assumptions.
14

We apologize to lovers of Russian literature for this deliberate misinterpretation of Anna Karenina –
“All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.”
