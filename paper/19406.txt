Are Tenure Track Professors Better Teachers?

NBER Working Paper No. 19406

JEL No. I23
ABSTRACT
This study makes use of detailed student-level data from eight cohorts of first-year students at Northwestern
University to investigate the relative effects of tenure track/tenured versus non-tenure line faculty on
student learning. We focus on classes taken during a student’s first term at Northwestern, and employ
a unique identification strategy in which we control for both student-level fixed effects and next-class-taken
fixed effects to measure the degree to which non-tenure line faculty contribute more or less to lasting
student learning than do other faculty. We find consistent evidence that students learn relatively more
from non-tenure line professors in their introductory courses. These differences are present across
a wide variety of subject areas, and are particularly pronounced for Northwestern’s average students
and less-qualified students.

I. Introduction
The role of tenure in American higher education has been reduced dramatically in
recent decades. In 1975, 57% of all faculty (excluding graduate students) were in the
tenure system; by 2009 that figure had been cut almost in half to 30%.1 Some observers
predict that the share of tenured/tenure track faculty will bottom out at between 15-20%,
with tenure being largely limited to the flagship public and private research universities
and the wealthiest of the liberal arts colleges.2
There is evidence that this trend accelerated after January 1, 1994, when
mandatory retirement for faculty was abolished by federal law. Ehrenberg (2012) reports
that between 1995 and 2007, the share of part-time faculty rose at almost all institutional
types while, among full-time faculty, the movement away from the tenure system has
quickened. Especially notable is the rise of the full-time, non-tenure track professor at
Ph.D. granting universities. Their representation within the entire group of full-time
faculty went from 24% to 35% at public doctoral institutions and from 18% to 46% at
private non-profit doctoral institutions.
This trend has led some observers to lament the potential blow to academic
freedom dealt by the decline of tenure and to focus on the often challenging employment
conditions under which many non-tenure track faculty work (see, for example, June
(2012) and Wilson (2010)). Further, McPherson and Schapiro (1999) point to efficiency
gains from tenure; they outline its positive role in influencing the distribution of authority
within colleges and universities.

There has been ongoing speculation about this topic in the educational press. Wilson
(2010) is a good example.

While those considerations certainly have relevance in evaluating the impact of
the growing demise of the tenure system, there is an educational outcome that may be
measured more directly: do undergraduates taught by faculty outside the tenure system
learn as much as those taught by tenured/tenure track faculty?
There have been a number of attempts to answer this question. On a national
level, Ehrenberg and Zhang (2005) present evidence that hiring more part-time and nontenured faculty lowers institutional graduation rates. This result is bolstered by Bettinger
and Long (2006), who find a similarly negative effect on aggregate levels of persistence
when they focus specifically on part-time adjuncts. These types of results indicate that
even if non-tenure track professors are more popular with students – perhaps because of
classroom behaviors that maximize student evaluations but not student learning – they
nonetheless might not be successful in improving students’ longer-term prospects.3 To
date, however, there exists little evidence on the effects of faculty tenure track status on
genuine student learning.
The limited existing evidence on the relative performance of tenure track/tenured
professors versus faculty outside the tenure system makes it difficult for college and
university decision-makers to determine the optimal staffing of their classrooms. This is
particularly relevant for research universities, which face a multi-tasking problem of
maximizing an objective function that includes both the production of cutting-edge
research and the provision of outstanding undergraduate teaching. While the paper
closest to this one in the literature, Bettinger and Long (2010), presents a novel approach
to measuring the effects of tenure line versus other instruction, their analysis is largely

to actually produce lower levels of “deep learning.”

centered on institutions whose principal purpose is teaching. In addition, while they find
some evidence that non-tenure track faculty induce student interest in a subject, as
measured by the likelihood that students take additional courses in that subject, they are
not able to study how students perform in subsequent classes – an ideal way to see
whether instructional quality has a lasting impact. When one only observes student
evaluations of their instructors, or the likelihood that students take more classes in the
subject, it is difficult to judge whether one type of instructor is genuinely better at
education – that is, do they produce more “deep learning” in the words of Carrell and
West (2010) – or just whether they are more popular. Hoffmann and Oreopoulos (2009)
evaluate teacher quality in a Canadian research university setting but, like Bettinger and
Long (2010), only observe the likelihood that students take additional classes in the same
subject, rather than observe their academic performance in future classes.4 They find no
evidence that non-tenure track faculty are either better or worse at inspiring students to
take more classes in their subjects. Carrell and West’s (2010) analysis of professor
quality examines follow-on classes, and has outstanding internal validity as it relies on
the random assignment of students to classes, but it is also based at an institution (the
U.S. Air Force Academy) where teaching, rather than research, is the dominant function.
In addition, Carrell and West do not directly take on the question of whether non-tenure
track faculty make for better or worse instructors.

Hoffmann and Oreopoulos do study student performance in courses with standardized
tests shared across individual class sections in the same term as their measure of
instructor quality, but they do not perform a head-to-head comparison of lecturers versus
tenure-track faculty members (their comparison controls for a measure of instructor
quality) and they are not able to follow students into future classes to gauge “deep
learning.”

We bring to bear the first evidence within the research university setting regarding
the relative effect of professors within the tenure system as opposed to those outside it
where we can observe student performance in subsequent classes in the same subject.
Specifically, we examine the initial classes taken by first-term freshmen in eight cohorts
of undergraduates at Northwestern University, a mid-sized research university that is one
of the twenty six private universities among the sixty two members of the Association of
American Universities and which consistently ranks amongst the most selective
undergraduate institutions in the United States. Our identification strategy involves
observing whether a student who takes, say, introductory economics with a faculty
member outside of the tenure system and introductory political science with a tenure
track professor in his or her first term at Northwestern is (1) relatively more likely to take
a second political science class than another economics class, and (2) conditional on
taking more classes in both subjects, more likely to perform better in the political science
class than in the economics class.
The answers to these questions should shed light on one of the most important
outcomes relating to the dramatic change in the professorate – its impact on student
learning.

II. Data and methods
We make use of data on all Northwestern University freshmen who entered
between fall 2001 and fall 2008, a total of 15,662 students.5 Our principal model for

We limit our analysis to students who entered Northwestern in fall 2008 or before to
give students sufficient time to complete their studies. 98 percent of students who
ultimately earn an undergraduate degree at Northwestern do so within five years.

estimating the relationship between the tenure track/tenured versus non-tenure track
status of a student’s instructor and that student’s level of learning in that subject is
Gicst+1 = αi + γcst+1 + βList + εist ,
where, for student i taking a first-term freshman-level class in subject s at time t, L
represents whether the class taken is taught by a non-tenure track faculty member and G
represents that student’s grade (on a four point scale) the next time the student takes a
class in subject s. The subscript c pertains to a specific instructor-class-term-year
combination, so the inclusion of a fixed effect γcst+1 means that we are comparing the
relative performance in subsequent classes in subjects A and B of a student who took a
class in subject A with a non-tenure track faculty member and subject B with a tenure
track/tenured professor during his or her first term at Northwestern, holding constant all
of the specifics of the subsequent classes in subjects A and B. This means that we are
obtaining our identification from subjects where some first-term freshmen take their first
classes from a tenure line professor and other first-term freshmen take their first classes
from a non-tenure track faculty member. We also estimate linear probability models
without the next-class fixed effect but with student fixed effects where the dependent
variable is whether the student takes another class in subject s. We cluster standard errors
at the student level to account for potential within-student error correlation.
We obtained data from several offices at Northwestern University for the
purposes of this analysis. The registrar’s office provided us with student transcript data,
including student grades, subjects, and instructor information; the office of admissions
provided us with information about the student’s initial declared major and academic
qualifications; and individual academic departments as well as the office of human

6

resources confirmed the tenure track/tenured versus non-tenure line status of all
instructors.6 Table 1 presents some descriptive statistics of the population of
Northwestern students. Northwestern evaluates freshman applicants on a five-point
academic indicator scale, where 1 is the strongest indicator and 5 is the weakest; 17% of
entering freshman have an academic indicator of 1, 57% have a 2, and 26% have an
academic indicator of 3 or higher (with the overwhelming majority of these students
having an indicator of 3). The average SAT score (or converted ACT score) for
beginning freshmen was 1392, and 17% of entering freshmen had not declared a desired
major at their time of entry to Northwestern. In 74% of cases, students took another class
in a subject that they took during their first term of freshman year, and when they took
the subsequent class, they averaged a grade of 3.39 on a 4-point scale.
We limit our analysis to first-term freshman students because our identification
assumption is that students select their first classes with limited knowledge about
instructor quality or characteristics. We further condition on student fixed effects
because we are concerned that students who take classes with one type of instructor
versus another may be relatively strong or weak students. The majority of students take
at least one course with a non-tenure track faculty member and at least one course with a
tenure line professor during their first term at Northwestern; 20.1% of students take
classes only with tenure track/tenured professors and 3.8% take classes only with nontenure line faculty.

We exclude graduate students and visiting professors who hold faculty appointments at
other institutions from our analysis. Our results are fundamentally unchanged if we
include these two groups, regardless of whether we assign them to the tenure
track/tenured category or to the non-tenure line category of instructor.
6

7

The third through seventh rows of Table 1 break down descriptive statistics by the
combination of a student’s classes taught by tenure line versus non-tenure track
professors. The small number of students who take only classes taught by non-tenure
track faculty tend to be somewhat weaker than the other students; 36% come from the
bottom ranks of students (as opposed to 26% for the other 96.2% of students), and their
SAT scores average 1362 (as opposed to 1393 for the other students, and 1392 overall).
But among the 96.2% of students who take at least one class from a tenure line faculty
member, there is no apparent relationship between the division of tenure track/tenured
versus non-tenure track classes and initial preparation. All four groups have 17% with
academic indicator 1, 25% to 27% with academic indicator 3 or above, and SAT scores
average between 1391 and 1395 depending on the group.
On the other hand, and foreshadowing our results, the four groups differ
substantially in terms of their outcomes. The probability that a student takes another
class in the subject generally increases with the number of non-tenure track taught classes
that the student takes in his or her first term at Northwestern, as does the grade earned in
the subsequent class. This latter pattern is especially remarkable, given that non-tenure
track faculty appear to induce relatively marginal students, who might have been
expected to perform worse in subsequent classes, to take those classes nonetheless. The
bulk of this paper explores these relationships in a more systematic manner.

III. Estimated effects of non-tenure track faculty on subsequent performance
Table 2 presents our basic results. The unit of analysis is the student-class pair for
first-term freshmen at Northwestern. To provide a basis for comparison, we report basic

8

OLS results in the first row of the table, and then successively add layers of fixed effects.
The leftmost columns of the table are for all classes taken by all students, while the
second set of columns restrict the analysis to the 89.9% of classes taken outside of a
student’s intended major.7
As can be seen in the first row of Table 2, the simple relationships between nontenure track status of the teacher of a class and a student’s likelihood of taking another
class and the grade obtained in that next class in a subject are positive and strongly
statistically significant. However, because these relationships could reflect unmeasured
student characteristics, we compare subjects taken by the same student and estimate
student fixed effects models; the estimated relationships remain reasonably large in
magnitude – a non-tenure track faculty member increases the likelihood that a student
will take another class in the subject by 7.3 percentage points (9.3 percentage points
when limited to classes outside the student’s intended major) and increases the grade
earned in that subsequent class by slightly more than one-tenth of a grade point (with a
somewhat greater impact for classes outside of the intended major).8,9 We can further

7

We show separate results for classes outside the student’s major to isolate the group of
students for whom the choice to take additional classes in the subject is most plausibly
impacted by the quality of the first professor they encounter.
8 Almost all classes taught by non-tenure track faculty at Northwestern are taught by
those with a longer-term relationship with the university. When we exclude the
temporary lecturers and adjuncts, the estimates barely change. Trimming the “one-off”
lecturers and adjuncts, we find that for all students and all classes, a non-tenure track
faculty member is estimated to increase the likelihood that a student takes another class in
the subject by 7.5 percentage points and increases the grade by 0.12 grade points. The
results are similarly nearly identical for all other rows in the table.
9
The results are also robust when we limit our analysis to each of the specific colleges
(there are six undergraduate colleges at Northwestern) where the classes were offered. In
student fixed effects regressions, the relationship between non-tenure track status and the
probability that a student will take another class in the subject is positive and statistically
significant in three of the four colleges (arts and sciences, music, and engineering, but not
9

restrict our analysis to students with “no choice” – classes that are always taught either by
tenure track/tenured faculty or by non-tenure line faculty during the entire time period
considered. In this restriction, we explicitly eliminate the possibility that a student is
“shopping” across instructors teaching a certain class. This occurs in 35.2% of classes
taken by first-term freshmen. The results are quite similar whether or not we make this
restriction.10
In the last row of Table 2 we introduce our preferred model specification – one
with both student fixed effects and next-class fixed effects. In this model we cannot
study the relationship between non-tenure track status and the likelihood of taking
another class in the subject because by default all students have taken another class in the
subject. Moreover, we cannot limit ourselves to students with “no choice” because we
must compare those who took the introductory class in subject A with a non-tenure track
faculty member to those who took that same class with a tenure line professor to have
variation when we control for next-class fixed effects. When we estimate this highlyparameterized model, we still find that having an initial experience in a subject with a
communications) that teach almost all of the first-semester freshman students, and the
relationship between non-tenure track status and the grade earned in the next class in the
subject is positive and statistically significant in all four colleges. In section IV of the
paper we also break down our results by the grading standards of the subjects and the
qualifications of students who intend to major in those subjects.
10 We can also limit ourselves to the small number of cases – 17% of students, 15% of
student-class observations – in which a student declares no intended major preference at
the time of entry to Northwestern. The results for this very restricted group are similar to
those reported in the table: in models with student fixed effects, the coefficient on nontenure track faculty is 0.120 (0.138 for students with “no choice”) when the dependent
variable is the probability of taking another class in the subject and 0.089 (0.088 for
students with “no choice”) when the dependent variable is the grade in the next class
taken in the subject. All of these coefficient estimates are statistically significant at the
five percent level or better. However, we do not have sufficient power to estimate our
preferred specification – with both student fixed effects and next-class fixed effects –
with the restricted set of students who are undeclared at the time of entry.
10

non-tenure track faculty member increases a student’s performance in subsequent
experiences with the subject. The point estimates are around half the size of those found
in the student fixed effects only specification, but are still statistically significant and
sizeable in magnitude given that the typical student’s grade in the next class is a robust
3.39 out of 4.
Because Northwestern relies somewhat more on non-tenure line faculty today
than it did a decade ago,11 and because Northwestern freshman classes have become
progressively more qualified over time, we also investigate whether the estimated impact
of having a non-tenure track faculty member are trending over time. (Of course, we are
estimating all models with student fixed effects and next-course fixed effects, which
would rule out the primary effects of temporal trends). As can be seen in Figure 1, when
we estimate our highly-parameterized model year-by-year we still observe a positive
relationship between having a non-tenure line faculty member and subsequent grades in
the subject in every year. In addition, there is no evidence of a temporal pattern in these
results, suggesting that any over-time trends in the use or utility of non-tenure track
versus tenure line faculty members is not driving the findings that we report.12

11

The typical freshman in fall 2001 took 38.9% of first-term courses from non-tenure
line faculty, as compared with 41.6% for the typical freshman in fall 2008.
12
One might also be concerned that changing grading standards over time are potentially
driving our results. However, grading standards have remained quite flat at Northwestern
during this time period. While the average next-course grade did rise modestly from 3.33
for fall 2001 entrants to 3.41 for fall 2008 entrants, student qualifications also rose during
this time period, with SATs increasing from 1376 for fall 2001 entrants to 1421 for fall
2008 entrants, so that average qualifications-adjusted grades actually fell slightly over our
time horizon. We describe in section IV our method for adjusting grades for student
qualifications.
11

IV. Differences by subject and student qualifications
Are the results the same for all students and for all subjects, or are they present in
some cases but not in others? In order to investigate these questions, we next divide the
course subjects along two dimensions. First, we split the subjects into thirds based on the
SAT scores of incoming students who intend to major in that discipline; we interpret this
as a measure of the perceived challenge of a subject by incoming students. Second, we
split the subjects into thirds based on a measure of the grading standards of faculty
teaching that subject. We calculate grading standards by regressing grades against
observed student qualifications;13 we call the departments that award higher-thanpredicted grades “higher-grading subjects.”14 These two measures are highly negatively
correlated – the correlation between the average SAT scores of intended majors in a
department and the grades that the department awards is -0.69 – but there is enough of a
discordance between the two to make reporting both measures meaningful. For instance,
though the highest-grading subjects generally fall into the low-SAT subject group, 33.3%
of the subjects with the highest grades are in the middle-SAT group, and 4.1% are in the
highest-SAT group.
We report the results of these splits for our preferred model specification – with
student fixed effects and next-class fixed effects – in Table 3. As can be seen, the
estimated effects of non-tenure line instructors for an introductory course are positive for
all sets of subjects, regardless of grading standards or perceived challenge. That said, the
estimated effects are strongest for the subjects with tougher grading standards (that is, the
13

Betts and Grogger (2003) and Figlio and Lucas (2004) measure grading standards in
similar ways, by comparing grades awarded to some external benchmark of predicted
grades.
14
We are restricted by the registrar from identifying specific departments in this paper.
12

relatively low-grading classes) and for those that attract the most qualified students. The
estimated effect of having a non-tenure line faculty member on subsequent grades is
more than twice as large in the high-SAT subjects as in the low-SAT subjects, and is also
substantial when comparing the hardest-grading to the easiest-grading subjects.
This pattern of results could either be due to the effects being strongest for these
groups of classes or because of ceiling effects – perhaps in the easiest-grading subjects
most students earn top grades and there is little opportunity for distinction. As can be
seen in Table 4, it’s not the case that everyone earns a top grade, even in the relatively
easy-grading subjects. This table presents the percentage of students earning a grade of
A- or A in each group of subjects, broken down by the student’s academic indicator, the
admission office’s pre-enrollment prediction of a student’s academic success at the
university. We see that in the easiest-grading third of subjects, 13% of students with an
academic level 1 earn grades of B+ or lower compared with 28% of level 3+ students.15
While there is certainly more room for grade dispersion in the toughest-grading subjects,
where 45% of level 1 students earn a B+ or lower and 78% of level 3+ students do the
same, the point is that in no subject and for no group of students is a grade of A or A- a
foregone conclusion. Nonetheless, while we cannot say for certain whether the stronger
results for harder-grading subjects and those attracting higher-rated students is due to the
effects of faculty status truly being greater for those subjects or whether there is simply
more room for grade dispersion in those subjects, the key finding is that we observe

15

It is important to recall that even the relatively marginal students at Northwestern are
still very highly qualified. The average SAT (or ACT equivalent) amongst those students
with an academic index of 3+ is still a very robust 1316.
13

advantages for non-tenure line faculty across all subjects, regardless of our measure of
perceived challenge or grading standards.
In Table 5 we split the population of students by student academic preparation
and then by both academic preparation and subject type. While we find that the bestprepared students at Northwestern appear to perform about the same regardless of
whether their first class in the subject was taught by a non-tenure line or tenure
track/tenured professor, the estimated positive effect of having a non-tenure line faculty
member is present and strongly statistically significant for all other groups of students.
Moreover, there appears to be an interaction between class type and student
qualifications: while there is no apparent relationship between instructor type and student
outcomes for the top-rated students, a clear pattern emerges for the other two groups of
students. For students with academic indicator 2, the estimated relationship between
instructor type and subsequent outcomes is about the same for the subjects attracting
relatively low and mid-level students but substantially larger for the subjects attracting
the most-qualified students, and about the same for easiest and middle-grading subjects
but considerably larger for the toughest-grading subjects. For students with academic
indicator 3+, the monotonic relationships are even more pronounced, with by far the
strongest estimated results of all observed for the relatively marginal students at
Northwestern taking the toughest-grading subjects and those attracting the most qualified
students. Note from Table 4 that the gap in the percentage receiving an A or A- between
the toughest-grading and the easiest-grading subjects is 49.7 percentage points for those
with academic indicator 3+, but nearly as high (44.3 percentage points) for academic
indicator 2 and still quite high (32.9 percentage points) for academic indicator 1.

14

Therefore, this pattern of estimated effects of instructor type broken down by student
qualifications and subject type suggests that these findings are likely due to genuinely
differential effects of instructor type across subject and student preparation, rather than
just pure ceiling effects or differential likelihood of earning higher grades in some
subjects versus others.
In sum, we estimated models with both student fixed effects and next-class fixed
effects, and found strong and consistent evidence that Northwestern faculty outside of the
tenure system outperform tenure track/tenured professors in introductory undergraduate
classrooms. Moreover, the results held for all subjects, regardless of grading standards or
the qualifications of the students the subjects attracted, though we found that the results
were particularly strong for tougher-grading subjects and those that attracted the most
qualified students. In addition, we found that the apparent benefits of taking classes from
non-tenure track faculty were enjoyed more by the less academically-qualified students
than by the more academically-qualified students – the biggest gains to faculty outside
the tenure system were for relatively weak students taking courses in the toughestgrading subjects.

V. Conclusion
Our findings suggest that non-tenure track faculty at Northwestern not only
induce students to take more classes in a given subject than do tenure line professors, but
also lead the students to do better in subsequent coursework than do their tenure
track/tenured colleagues.

15

How generalizable are these results? Because a key part of our identification
strategy is to limit our analysis to first-term freshman undergraduates, the evidence that
non-tenure track faculty produce better outcomes may not apply to more advanced
courses. Further, Northwestern University is one of the most selective and highly-ranked
research universities in the world, and its ability to attract first-class non-tenure track
faculty may be different from that of most institutions. Its tenure track/tenured faculty
members may also have different classroom skills from those at other schools. Finally,
Northwestern students come from a rarefied portion of the preparation distribution and
are far from reflective of the general student population in the U.S. That said, our
findings that the benefits of taking courses with non-tenure track faculty appear to be
stronger for the relatively marginal students at Northwestern indicate that our findings
may be relevant to a considerably wider range of institutions.
There are many aspects relating to changes in the tenure status of faculty – from
the impact on research productivity to the protection of academic freedom. But certainly
learning outcomes are an important consideration in evaluating whether the observed
trend away from tenure track/tenured towards non-tenure line faculty is good or bad. Our
results provide evidence that the rise of full-time designated teachers at U.S. colleges and
universities may be less of a cause for alarm than some people think, and indeed, may
actually be educationally beneficial. Perhaps the growing practice of hiring a
combination of research-intensive tenure track faculty members and teaching-intensive
lecturers may be an efficient and educationally positive solution to a research university’s
multi-tasking problem.

Notes: Data include all students who enrolled in their first quarter at Northwestern
University during the fall terms between 2001 and 2008. Northwestern evaluates
freshman applicants on a five-point academic indicator scale, where 1 is the strongest
indicator and 5 is the weakest. SAT score is on the 1600 point scale and converted ACT
score is used where applicable.

Notes: Data include all students who enrolled in their first quarter at Northwestern
University during the fall terms between 2001 and 2008. Each cell represents a different
model specification. Standard errors adjusted for clustering at the student level are
reported in parentheses beneath coefficient estimates. Next-class information is recorded
for the first time a student takes a second class in a given subject area. Intended majors
are recorded by the Office of Admissions. Coefficients marked ***, **, and * are
statistically distinct at the 1, 5, and 10 percent levels, respectively. Data come from
15,662 students taking 56,599 first-quarter classes.
