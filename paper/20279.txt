                                             ABSTRACT

Investment in water purification technologies led to large mortality declines by helping eradicate typhoid
fever and other waterborne diseases. This paper seeks to understand how these technologies affected
human capital formation. We use typhoid fatality rates during early life as a proxy for water quality.
To carry out the analysis, city-level data are merged with a unique dataset linking individuals between
the 1900 and 1940 censuses. Parametric and semi-parametric estimates suggest that eradicating early-life
exposure to typhoid fever would have increased earnings in later life by 1% and increased educational
attainment by one month. Instrumenting for typhoid fever using the typhoid rates from cities that lie
upstream produces similar results. A simple cost-benefit analysis indicates that the increase in earnings
from eradicating typhoid fever was more than sufficient to offset the costs of eradication.

                                                                                                            I.  INTRODUCTION  


                           Poor   water   quality   remains   a   major   threat   to   human   health.  

Approximately  780  million  people  do  not  have  access  to  improved  water  

sources,   leaving   them   vulnerable   to   typhoid   fever,   cholera,   and   other  

waterborne   diseases. 1   Each   year   21.5   million   persons   contract   typhoid  

fever   while   5   million   contract   cholera.2  Furthermore,   diarrheal   diseases  

alone   account   for   1.8   million   deaths   each   year   or   4.7   percent   of   deaths  

worldwide.3  


                           There   is   a   large   economic   literature   analyzing   the   impact   of   water  

purification  on  disease  rates  and  early-­‐‑life  health  outcomes,  notably  infant  

mortality.   Perhaps   the   central   finding   of   this   research   is   that   water  

purification   has   large   and   diffuse   health   effects,   accounting   for   roughly  

fifty   percent   of   the   decrease   in   U.S.   mortality   between   1900   and   1950  

(Cutler   and   Miller   2005;   Ferrie   and   Troesken   2008).   While   the   extant  

literature   has   done   a   thorough   job   identifying   and   measuring   the   short-­‐‑

term   health   effects   of   improving   water   quality,   economists   have   yet   to  

identify  the  long-­‐‑term  economic  effects  of  water  purification.  There  is,  in  

particular,   no   evidence   on   how   drinking   impure   water   in   childhood  

impairs  human  capital  attainment  twenty  to  thirty  years  later,  nor  is  there  

any  evidence  regarding  labor  market  outcomes.  Accordingly,  our  goal  in

this   paper   is   to   analyze   how   early-­‐‑life   exposure   to   impure   water   affects  

adult   outcomes,   particularly   in   terms   of   educational   attainment   and  

income.  


                           Our  analysis  is  predicated  on  a  linkage  procedure  that  allows  us  to  

identify   how   exposure   to   contaminated   water   during   the   in   utero,  

neonatal,   and   postnatal   periods   affects   later   life   economic   outcomes.   We  

use  typhoid  fever  fatality  rates,  a  waterborne  disease,  as  a  proxy  for  water  

quality.4  We   link   city-­‐‑year   level   typhoid   fatality   rates   to   children   in   the  

1900  Census,  which  is  then  linked  to  adult  outcomes  in  the  1940  Census.  

Parametric   and   semi-­‐‑parametric   results   indicate   that   the   eradication   of  

typhoid  fever,  which  cities  achieved  by  purifying  their  water,  would  have  

increased  educational  attainment  by  one  month  and  increased  earnings  by  

about  one  percent.  


                           Of  course,  one  might  be  concerned  that  investing  in  water  quality  is  

correlated   with   unobserved   variables   that   might   also   influence   human  

capital   formation.      Given   this,   we   implement   an   instrumental   variables  

strategy.   Because   typhoid   is   a   waterborne   disease,   cities   that   dump   their  

sewage   into   a   river   will   increase   future   typhoid   rates   for   cities  

downstream.   Using   typhoid   rates   from   the   nearest   upstream   city   as   an  

instrument,   we   find   results   that   are   larger.   Specifically,   these   results  

indicate   that   if   typhoid   had   been   eradicated,   schooling   would   have  

increased   by   nine   months   and   earnings   would   have   increased   by   about  

nine   percent.   However,   only   the   estimate   for   schooling   is   statistically

two.  




                                                                                                                   3  
  


significant.   We   also   find   some   evidence   that   high   typhoid   rates   during  

early-­‐‑life  impaired  geographic  mobility.  


        This   paper   complements   the   existing   literature   on   the   benefits   to  

water   purification.   Culter   and   Miller   (2005)   show   that   the   adoption   of  

water   purification   technologies   decreased   total   mortality   by   13   percent,  

infant   mortality   by   46   percent,   and   child   mortality   by   50   percent.  

Furthermore,   those   of   lower   socioeconomic   status   might   have   been   the  

primary  beneficiaries  to  water  purification  efforts.  Troesken  (2004)  shows  

that   water   filtration   reduced   typhoid   rates   among   African   Americans   by  

52  percent,  but  reduced  white  disease  rates  by  only  16  percent.    Currie  et  

al.   (2013)   analyze   birth   records   and   water   quality   in   New   Jersey   from  

1997-­‐‑2007.   They   find   that   exposure   to   contaminated   water   during  

pregnancy  is  associated  with  lower  birth  weights  and  higher  incidence  of  

premature  birth  for  the  children  of  less  educated  mothers.  


        As  impressive  as  these  short-­‐‑term  benefits  are,  the  benefits  to  water  

purification   are   likely   understated.   A   growing   literature   has   shown   that  

early-­‐‑life  exposure  to  disease  and  deprivation  has  adverse  effects  on  adult  

health   and   economic   outcomes,   lowering   educational   attainment,  

earnings,   and   mortality   (see   Almond   and   Currie   (2011)   for   a   detailed  

overview).   Because   the   diseases   that   accompany   contaminated   water   are  

manifold   and   often   severe   in   their   consequences,   it   is   reasonable   to  

hypothesize  that  early-­‐‑life  exposure  to  contaminated  water  will  have  long-­‐‑

run   effects.   Consistent   with   the   literature,   we   find   that   exposure   to  

contaminated   water   decreased   educational   attainment   and   earnings.   Our  

findings   are   particularly   relevant   for   policymakers   in   the   developing  

world.  Many  developing  countries  have  yet  to  undertake  efforts  to  purify  


                                             4  
  


their   water,   possibly   because   water   purification   is   costly.   Cutler   and  

Miller  (2005)  estimate  the  social  return  to  water  purification  to  be  23  to  1.  

Our   results   indicate   that   the   discounted   increase   in   earnings   alone   was  

sufficient  to  offset  the  costs  of  water  purification.  


  


                                                                                                           II.  TYPHOID  FEVER  


II.a.  Typhoid  as  an  indicator  of  water  quality  


                           In   this   paper,   our   primary   indicator   of   water   quality   is   typhoid  

fever.  Before  the  advent  of  formal  water  testing,  typhoid  fever  was  taken  

as  an  indicator  of  water  quality  among  public  health  experts.  For  example,  

George   F.   Whipple   argued   that   “the   relation   between   [water   quality   and  

typhoid]  is  so  close  that  the  typhoid  death-­‐‑rate  has  been  often  used  as  an  

index  of  the  quality  of  the  water.  Generally  speaking  .  .  .  a  very  low  death  

rate   indicates   a   pure   water,   and   a   very   high   rate,   contaminated   water”.5  

Similarly,  a  report  on  water  quality  in  New  York  City  in  1912  stated  that  

“the  death  rate  from  typhoid  fever  is  commonly  taken  as  one  index  of  the  

quality   of   a   water   supply.” 6   This   same   report   noted,   however,   that  

typhoid   was   an   imperfect   indicator   of   water   quality   because   typhoid  

epidemics  could  sometimes  be  caused  by  milk,  shellfish  or  other  sources,  

and   because   the   absence   of   typhoid   did   not   guarantee   the   water   in  

question   was   free   from   other   pathogens   that   might   cause   diarrhea,  

cholera,  or  other  diseases.

         While  it  is  true  that  typhoid  could  be  spread  by  means  other  than  

water,   in   the   era   before   water   treatment   those   sources   of   infection  

accounted  for  only  a  tiny  fraction  of  all  typhoid  outbreaks  (Troesken  2004;  

Whipple   1908,   pp.   131-­‐‑33).   In   addition,   as   explained   below,   typhoid   was  

eradicated   not   through   shellfish   inspection   or   milk   pasteurization   but  

through  improvements  in  water  quality.  It  is  well  established  in  historical  

demography   that   water   filtration   and   chlorination   were   by   far   the   most  

important  in  the  eradication  of  typhoid  (Ferrie  and  Troesken  2005;  Melosi  

2000,  pp.  138-­‐‑47;  Troesken  2004).  As  for  the  idea  that  typhoid  did  not  fully  

reflect   all   possible   pathogens   in   the   water,   typhoid   fever   rates   were  

correlated  with  the  death  rate  from  cholera  and  diarrhea  (Fuertes  1897).  


         To  demonstrate  that  typhoid  fatality  rates  are  correlated  with  water  

quality,   we   take   data   from   thirteen   cities   in   North   Carolina.   This   data  

reports   typhoid   fatality   rates   for   whites   and   water   bacteria   counts   for   41  

city-­‐‑year   pairs.   Regressing   bacteria   counts   on   typhoid   fatality   rates   (see  

column   one   of   Table   1)   reveals   a   positive   but   insignificant   relationship.  

However,  collapsing  this  data  at  the  city  level  and  comparing  the  average  

typhoid   rate   by   city   to   the   city’s   average   bacteria   count   reveals   a   strong  

positive  relationship.  The  p-­‐‑value  is  0.051  or  0.007  depending  on  whether  

the   observations   are   weighted   by   the   number   of   years   included   in   the  

sample.   Because   typhoid   fatality   rates   vary   from   year   to   year,   average  

typhoid  rates  are  a  better  predictor  of  bacterial  counts  than  instantaneous  

typhoid  rates.  This  observation  has  implications  for  our  empirical  analysis                    

below.    In  particular,  instead  of  using  typhoid  rates  from  an  individual’s  

year  of  birth,  we  use  average  typhoid  rates  from  the  prenatal  to  neonatal  

period  as  a  proxy  for  water  quality  during  early  life.

                           During   the   late   nineteenth   and   early   twentieth   century,   the  

waterborne   disease   that   posed   the   most   serious   threat   to   American  

populations   was   typhoid   fever—as   of   1900,   probably   one   of   every   three  

Americans  would  have  contracted  typhoid  at  one  point  in  his  or  her  life.7  

Typhoid  was  caused  by  the  bacterium  Salmonella  typhi,  and  was  typically  

contracted   by   drinking   water   tainted   by   the   fecal   wastes   of   infected  

individuals.  A  common  transmission  might  have  gone  something  like  this.  

The  family  of  a  typhoid  victim  dumped  the  patient’s  waste  into  a  cesspool  

or   privy   vault.   If   the   vault   was   too   shallow   or   had   leaks,   it   seeped   into  

underground   water   sources.   In   turn,   if   these   water   sources   were   not  

adequately   filtered,   people   who   drew   their   water   from   them   contracted  

typhoid.   Typhoid   rates   in   a   given   city   or   region   were,   therefore,   highly  

correlated   with   the   quality   and   extensiveness   of   water   and   sewerage  

systems.8  


II.b.  Living  and  dying  with  typhoid  


                           Once  they  entered  the  body,  typhoid  bacilli  had  a  one  to  three  week  

incubation  period.  During  incubation,  an  infected  individual  experienced  

mild   fatigue,   loss   of   appetite,   and   minor   muscle   aches.   After   incubation,  

the  victim  experienced  more  severe  symptoms:    chills,  coated  tongue,  nose  

bleeds,   coughing,   insomnia,   nausea,   and   diarrhea.   At   its   early   stages,  

typhoid’s   symptoms   often   resembled   those   of   respiratory   diseases   and  

pneumonia   was   often   present.   In   nearly   all   cases,   typhoid   victims

                                                                                                                   7  
  


experienced   severe   fever.   Body   temperatures   could   reach   as   high   as   105º  

Fahrenheit.    


                           Three   weeks   after   incubation,   the   disease   was   at   its   worst.   The  

patient   was   delirious,   emaciated,   and   often   had   blood-­‐‑tinged   stools.   One  

in   five   typhoid   victims   experienced   a   gastrointestinal   hemorrhage.  

Internal   hemorrhaging   resulted   when   typhoid   perforated   the   intestinal  

wall  and  sometimes  continued  on  to  attack  the  kidneys  and  liver.  The  risk  

of   pulmonary   complications,   such   as   pneumonia   and   tuberculosis,   was  

high   at   this   time.   The   high   fever   associated   with   typhoid   was   so   severe  

that   about   one-­‐‑half   of   all   victims   experienced   neuropsychiatric   disorders  

at   the   peak   of   the   disease.   These   disorders   included   encephalopathy  

(brain-­‐‑swelling),   nervous   tremors   and   other   Parkinson-­‐‑like   symptoms,  

abnormal  behavior,  babbling  speech,  confusion,  and  visual  hallucinations.  

If,   however,   the   patient   survived   all   of   this,   the   fever   began   to   fall   and   a  

long  period  of  recovery  set  in.  It  could  take  as  long  as  four  months  to  fully  

recover.  Surprisingly,  given  the  severity  of  typhoid’s  symptoms,  90  to  95  

percent  of  its  victims  survived.9  


                           That   typhoid   killed   only   5   to   10   percent   of   its   victims   might   lead  

one   to   wonder   just   how   significant   this   disease   could   have   been   for  

human   health   and   longevity.   But   typhoid’s   low   case   fatality   rate  

understates   the   disease’s   true   impact,   because   when   typhoid   did   not   kill  

you  quickly  and  directly,  it  killed  you  slowly  and  indirectly.

         A  simple  way  to  illustrate  this  last  point  is  by  looking  at  the  results  

of   a   study   conducted   by   Louis   I.   Dublin   in   1915.   Dublin   followed   1,574  

typhoid  survivors  over  a  three-­‐‑year  period.  Comparing  the  mortality  rates  

of  typhoid  survivors  to  the  mortality  rates  of  similarly-­‐‑aged  persons  who  

had  never  suffered  from  typhoid,  he  found  that  during  the  first  year  after  

recovery,   typhoid   survivors   were,   on   average,   three   times   more   likely   to  

have  died  than  those  who  had  never  been  exposed  to  typhoid,  and  that  in  

the   second   year   after   recovery,   typhoid   survivors   were   two   times   more  

likely   to   have   died   than   non-­‐‑typhoid   survivors.   By   the   third   year   after  

recovery,   however,   typhoid   survivors   did   not   face   an   elevated   risk   of  

mortality.   The   two   biggest   killers   of   typhoid   survivors   were   tuberculosis  

(39  percent  of  all  deaths)  and  heart  failure  (23  percent).  Other  prominent  

killers  included  kidney  failure  (8  percent)  and  pneumonia  (7  percent).  


         More   recently,   Case   and   Paxson   (2009)   present   econometric  

evidence   that   early-­‐‑life   exposure   to   diarrhea   and   typhoid   fever   impairs  

cognitive   functioning   later   in   life.   This   finding   is   particularly   important  

for   the   results   presented   in   this   paper,   which   show   that   increased  

exposure   to   typhoid   as   a   child   is   associated   with   lower   incomes   and  

reduced   educational   attainment   in   adulthood.   Along   the   same   lines,  

Almond  et  al.  (2012)  and  Costa  (2000)  show  early-­‐‑life  exposure  to  disease  

can   raise   the   probability   of   contracting   diabetes,   heart   disease,   and   other  

chronic  health  problems  later  in  life.  


II.c.  The  eradication  of  typhoid  fever  


         For  much  of  the  nineteenth  century,  people  believed  typhoid  arose  

spontaneously   or   spread   through   miasmas   —   miasmas   were   poisonous  



                                                9  
  


atmospheres  thought  to  rise  from  swamps,  decaying  matter,  and  filth.  In  

1840,  William  Budd  challenged  these  ideas,  showing  that  typhoid  spread  

through  water  and  food.  Budd  recommended  investment  in  public  health  

infrastructure   to   halt   the   spread   of   typhoid.   However,   scientists   who  

continued  to  espouse  the  idea  that  typhoid  arose  spontaneously,  or  spread  

through  miasmas,  vigorously  attacked  Budd  and  his  new  theory.  Because  

of   their   attacks,   Budd’s   recommendations   were   not   soon   implemented,  

and   typhoid   rates   in   Europe   remained   as   high   as   500   deaths   per   100,000  

persons.   It   took   more   than   three   decades   for   Budd’s   theories   and  

recommendations  to  take  hold  in  England.  In  1875,  the  British  government  

passed   the   Public   Health   Act   and   began   improving   its   public   health  

systems.  Ten  years  later,  typhoid  rates  in  England  had  fallen  50  percent.10  


                           With  the  development  of  Budd’s  ideas  in  particular,  and  the  germ  

theory  of  disease  in  general,  public  health  officials  in  America  and  Europe  

came   to   agree:   to   control   typhoid,   cities   needed   to   assure   purity   of  

drinking   water   through   filtration   and   chlorination,   and   through   sanitary  

sewage   disposal.   The   experience   of   Pittsburgh,   Pennsylvania   highlights  

the  effectiveness  of  water  filtration  in  controlling  typhoid  fever.  Pittsburgh  

drew   its   water   from   the   Allegheny   and   Monongahela   Rivers.   Upstream  

from  the  city,  seventy-­‐‑five  municipalities  dumped  their  raw  and  untreated  

sewerage  into  the  rivers,  leaving  Pittsburgh’s  typhoid  rate  higher  than  any  

other  major  U.S.  city.  Pittsburgh  held  this  distinction  throughout  the  late  

nineteenth   century.   Then,   in   1899,   Pittsburgh   voters   approved   a   bond  

issue   for   the   construction   of   a   water   filtration   plant.   Unfortunately,

                                                                                                                   10  
  


political   bickering   delayed   completion   of   the   plant   until   1907.   Once   the  

plant  was  in  operation,  though,  typhoid  rates  improved,  and  by  1912,  they  

equaled  the  average  rate  in  America’s  five  largest  cities.11  


                           As  Figure  1  shows,  in  the  years  before  the  introduction  of  filtration,  

typhoid  rates  in  Pittsburgh  averaged  about  100  deaths  per  100,000.  Within  

two   years,   filtration   had   reduced   typhoid   rates   in   Pittsburgh   by   roughly  

75  percent.  And  through  subsequent  improvements  and  extensions  in  the  

city’s  water  supply,  typhoid  rates  were  brought  down  to  around  6  deaths  

per  100,000  by  1920.  This  represented  a  reduction  of  about  95  percent  from  

pre-­‐‑filtration   levels.   As   impressive   as   the   Pittsburgh   example   is,   it  

represents  a  typical  response  of  typhoid  fever  to  filtration.12  


                           Water  filtration  was  not  the  only  effective  mechanism  at  decreasing  

typhoid   fever.   The   other   panels   of   Figure   1   show   that   typhoid   fell  

following  the  introduction  of  chlorination  in  Detroit,  and  the  extension  of  

water  intake  cribs  away  from  the  shoreline  in  Cleveland.  In  all  cities,  the  

introduction   of   water   purification   technologies   was   followed   by   sharp  

reductions  in  the  death  rate  from  typhoid  fever  (Melosi,  2002;  Ellms  1913;  

Cutler  and  Miller,  2005).    The  introduction  of  sewers  also  had  an  effect  on  

mortality  rates  (Kestenbaum  and  Rosenthal,  2014;  Beemer,  Anderton,  and  

Leonard,   2005;   and   Ferrie   and   Troesken,   2005).   Because   cities   used  

different   technologies   to   purify   their   water,   and   because   implementation

water  quality)  in  reducing  typhoid  rates,  see  Whipple  (1908,  pp.  228-­‐‑66).  On  the  
Pittsburgh  experience,  see  Troesken  (2004,  pp.  27  and  56).

dates   are   not   reported   consistently,   we   use   typhoid   as   a   proxy   for   clean  

water  rather  than  these  technologies  themselves.  


                           Some   observers   have   argued   that   just   looking   at   typhoid,   as   we  

have   done   here,   understates   the   benefits   of   water   filtration   because  

eradicating   typhoid   has   broad   benefits.   Specifically,   eradicating   typhoid  

affected   mortality   from   a   broad   class   of   diseases   and   illnesses.   The   non-­‐‑

typhoid   death   rates   that   were   the   most   responsive   to   improvements   in  

water   quality   were   infantile   gastroenteritis   (diarrhea),   tuberculosis,  

pneumonia,  influenza,  bronchitis,  heart  disease,  and  kidney  disease.13    


                           The   experience   of   Chicago   nicely   illustrates   how   improving   water  

quality  not  only  reduced  deaths  from  typhoid  fever  but  also  a  broad  class  

of   diseases   not   usually   considered   waterborne.   From   the   late-­‐‑nineteenth  

century   onward,   Chicago’s   primary   water   source   was   Lake   Michigan.  

Unfortunately,  Lake  Michigan  was  also  frequently  polluted  with  sewage,  

which  carried  disease-­‐‑causing  pathogens.  This  pollution  occurred  because  

for   much   of   the   nineteenth   century   the   city   dumped   its   sewage   directly  

into  the  lake,  or  into  the  Chicago  River  which  flowed  into  the  lake.  Over  

the   course   of   the   nineteenth   and   early   twentieth   century,   Chicago   took  

two  important  steps  in  trying  to  prevent  fecal  pollution  from  entering  the  

city’s  water  mains.  The  first  step  occurred  in  1893,  when  the  city  opened  

the  Four-­‐‑Mile  water  intake  crib,  the  Sixty-­‐‑eighth  Street  water  intake  crib,  

and  permanently  closured  all  shoreline  sewage  outlets.14  The  second  step

occurred   in   1917,   when   the   city   opened   the   Wilson   Avenue   water   intake  

crib  and  completed  its  citywide  chlorination  of  the  public  water  supply.15      


                           The  completion  of  these  projects  corresponded  with  sharp  drops  in  

the   city’s   death   rate   from   typhoid   fever.   This   can   be   seen   in   Figure   2,  

which   plots   typhoid   rates   in   Chicago   from   1865   to   1925.   There   are   two  

vertical   lines,   each   corresponding   to   the   aforementioned   technological  

improvements   promoting   water   purity.   Note   in   particular   the   dramatic  

effects   of   the   Four   Mile   and   Sixty-­‐‑eight   street   water   intake   cribs   and   the  

closure   of   shoreline   sewage   outlets   in   1893.   Before   1893,   typhoid   rates  

averaged  73  deaths  per  100,000,  and  death  rates  were  often  as  high  as  100  

to   150.   After   1893,   death   rates   never   rose   above   50,   and   shortly   after   the  

opening  of  the  Chicago  drainage  canal  in  1900,  rates  never  rose  above  25.  

The   installation   and   extension   of   chlorination   around   1917   drove   down  

typhoid  rates  still  further  until  rates  were  hovering  around  0  by  the  early  

1920s.16  


                           These   improvements   in   water   quality   were   also   associated   with  

large   reductions   in   deaths   from   diseases   other   than   just   typhoid   fever.  

This   can   be   seen   in   the   second   panel   of   Figure   2,   which   plots   the   total  

death   rate   excluding   deaths   from   typhoid   fever.   Again,   the   vertical   lines  

correspond   to   the   two   regime   changes   in   the   city’s   water   supply.   The

patterns   are   striking.   Although   death   rates   appear   to   be   trending  

downward   almost   from   the   start   of   the   time   series,   that   trend   is   modest  

and   highly   variable.   The   two   most   prominent   changes   in   the   death   rate  

are   associated   with   improvements   in   the   city’s   water   supply.   After   the  

closure   of   shoreline   sewage   outlets   and   the   opening   of   two   new   intake  

cribs   in   1893,   the   total   death   rate   quickly   fell   to   1500   per   100,000,   and  

never   again   even   remotely   approached   levels   between   2000   and   2500,  

which   were   commonplace   before   1893.   Another   sharp   discontinuity   is  

observed   in   1917   when   death   rates   fell   to   around   1100.   The   year   1917,  

moreover,   coincides   with   the   completion   of   the   city’s   water   chlorination  

system.  


         One   might   argue   that   the   decline   in   non-­‐‑typhoid   deaths   was   the  

result   of   other   public   health   investments.   However,   Cutler   and   Miller  

(2005)  show  that  death  rates  from  pneumonia,  diphtheria,  and  meningitis  

fell  following  the  adoption  of  water  purification  technologies.  Specifically,  

they  estimate  that  for  every  one  typhoid  fever  death  prevented  by  water  

purification   there   were   four   deaths   from   other   causes   that   were   also  

prevented.   Ferrie   and   Troesken   (2008)   present   similar,   though   somewhat  

stronger,  evidence  along  these  lines.    The  available  evidence  suggests  that  

these   diseases   improved   with   water   filtration   because   typhoid   was   a  

virulent  disease  that  left  a  person  vulnerable  to  secondary  infections  even  

if  he  or  she  survived  its  direct  effects.    


           


                                               III.  DATA  




                                                 14  
  


        Given   the   large   literature   showing   how   early-­‐‑life   exposure   to  

disease   impairs   human   capital   formation,   and   given   the   observation   that  

typhoid   had   large   and   diffuse   health   effects,   one   expects   that   typhoid  

would   have   also   had   large   and   diffuse   effects   on   economic   and   social  

outcomes.   To   identify   these   effects   we   combine   city-­‐‑year   level   typhoid  

fatality   data   with   a   linked   sample   of   males   from   the   1900   and   1940  

censuses.  


        We   obtain   typhoid   fatality   rates   in   the   late   nineteenth   and   early  

twentieth  centuries  for  75  cities.  This  data  was  transcribed  from  Whipple  

(1908)  as  well  as  the  10th  annual  Census  mortality  statistics.  Figure  3  maps  

the  cities  used  in  our  analysis.  These  cities  tend  to  fall  within  the  top  100  in  

terms   of   population.   In   1900,   they   had   an   average   population   of   225,364  

and   a   median   population   of   94,969.   The   cities   are   predominantly   located  

in   the   Northeast   and   the   Midwest   but   include   all   regions   of   the  

continental  United  States.  


        As   a   measure   of   early-­‐‑life   exposure   to   contaminated   water,   we  

average  typhoid  rates  during  the  year  of  birth,  the  year  before  birth,  and  

the  year  after  birth.  Figure  4  visually  displays  typhoid  rates  and  the  three-­‐‑

year   moving   average   for   Boston,   New   York,   Philadelphia,   and   St.   Louis  

between  1890  and  1910.  Our  analysis  will  focus  on  the  three-­‐‑year  moving  

average.  This  has  two  advantages.  First,  because  typhoid  rates  are  volatile,  

the  moving  average  provides  a  better  proxy  for  average  water  quality.  As  

shown   in   Table   1   and   discussed   in   section   two,   typhoid   rates   averaged  

over   several   years   are   a   better   predictor   of   water   bacterial   counts   than  

instantaneous   typhoid   rates.   Second,   the   three-­‐‑year   moving   average  

roughly   corresponds   with   the   prenatal,   neonatal,   and   postnatal   periods,  


                                              15  
  


which  captures  exposure  during  early  life.  Figure  5  plots  the  distribution  

of  average  typhoid  rates  during  early  life.  The  distribution  is  skewed  right  

with   a   mean   of   41.72   deaths   per   100,000.   The   domain   ranges   from   10.39  

deaths  per  100,000  to  217.96  deaths  per  100,000.    


         We   merge   this   typhoid   fatality   data   to   linked   micro   data.   This  

dataset  links  individuals  observed  in  the  1940  and  1900  censuses  that  were  

born  between  1889  and  1900.  We  restrict  our  analysis  to  males  who,  at  the  

time  of  the  1900  census,  were  living  in  a  city  for  which  we  have  typhoid  

data.   Because   we   treat   the   city   of   residence   in   1900   as   the   birth   city,   we  

drop   any   individual   that   was   born   in   a   state   other   than   their   state   of  

residence  in  1900.  We  believe  this  assumption  is  reasonable  given  that  the  

sample  would  be  at  most  eleven  years  old  in  1900.  


         Summary  statistics  are  reported  in  Table  2.  Age,  education,  income,  

homeownership   status,   and   whether   the   individual   moved   from   their  

birth   city   are   taken   from   the   1940   census.   These   outcome   variables   are  

measured  during  peak  earning  years  (ages  40-­‐‑51).  The  percent  of  blacks  is  

small  because  we  are  looking  at  individuals  born  in  cities  before  the  Great  

Migration.  The  average  individual  in  our  sample  spent  their  early  life  in  a  

city  with  an  average  typhoid  rate  of  42  deaths  per  100,000.    


           


                                         IV.  RESULTS  


IV.a.  OLS  results  


         In   Table   3   we   estimate   the   relationship   between   early-­‐‑life   typhoid  

and  adult  outcomes  using  the  following  equation:  


                                                  16  
  


            𝑦!"# = 𝛼 + 𝛽𝑇𝑦𝑝ℎ𝑜𝑖𝑑!" + 𝛾𝟏 𝑏𝑙𝑎𝑐𝑘! + 𝑏𝑖𝑟𝑡ℎ  𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑦  𝐹𝐸′𝑠                                     (1)  
                                +   𝑏𝑖𝑟𝑡ℎ  𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟  𝐹𝐸′𝑠 + 𝑏𝑖𝑟𝑡ℎ  𝑜𝑟𝑑𝑒𝑟  𝐹𝐸′𝑠   +    𝜖!   

where   the   outcome   for   individual   i   born   in   city   j   during   year   k   is   either  

years   of   schooling,   ln(income),   homeownership   status,   or   mover/stayer  

status   in   1940.   Typhoid   is   the   average   typhoid   rate   during   early   life   for  

individuals  born  in  city  j  during  birth  year  k,  where  early  life  is  defined  as  

the  year  before  birth  until  the  year  after  birth.  We  cluster  standard  errors  

at  the  birth-­‐‑city  level.  Each  regression  includes  fixed  effects  for  each  birth  

city,  birth  year,  and  birth  order.  Because  outcomes  are  taken  from  the  1940  

census,   controlling   for   birth   year   automatically   controls   for   age.   We   find  

that  typhoid  during  early  life  decreases  educational  attainment  and  adult  

income,   but   we   find   no   effect   on   homeownership   status   or   geographic  

mobility  (mover/stayer  status).  These  results  indicate  that  if  typhoid  were  

eradicated,  years  of  schooling  would  have  increased  by  nearly  one  month  

and  income  would  have  increased  by  one  percent.  


          To  illustrate  that  these  results  are  driven  by  early-­‐‑life  exposure  and  

not  exposure  during  other  ages  we  estimate  a  variant  of  equation  (1)  that  

includes   typhoid   rates   during   the   following   years:   7   to   5   years   before  

birth;   4   to   2   years   before   birth;   2   to   4   years   after   birth;   5   to   7   years   after  

birth,  as  well  as  our  measure  of  early-­‐‑life  exposure  (1  year  before  birth  to  1  

year  after  birth).  Figure  6  plots  the  95  percent  confidence  interval  for  these  

estimates.   Consistent   with   Table   3,   Figure   6   illustrates   that   early-­‐‑life  

typhoid   rates   are   associated   with   a   decline   in   education   and   income   in  

adulthood.   No   other   periods   are   significant.   Furthermore,   the   estimated  

relationship   between   early-­‐‑life   typhoid   exposure   and   adult   outcomes   is  

similar   to   the   estimates   presented   in   Table   3.   Although   not   presented   in  


                                                      17  
  


Figure   6,   the   effect   on   homeownership   status   and   mobility   remains  

insignificant.    


IV.b.  Semi-­‐‑parametric  results  


                           A   concern   with   the   analysis   above   is   that   it   imposes   a   linear  

relationship   on   the   data   when   the   data   might   in   fact   be   related   in   non-­‐‑

linear   ways.      To   address   this   concern,   we   estimate   the   relationship  

between  typhoid  and  adult  outcomes  semi-­‐‑parametrically.  Specifically,  we  

estimate  the  following  equation:  


                                  𝑦!" = 𝛼 + 𝑓 𝑇𝑦𝑝ℎ𝑜𝑖𝑑!" + 𝛽 𝑏𝑙𝑎𝑐𝑘!" + 𝛾 𝑏𝑖𝑟𝑡ℎ  𝑜𝑟𝑑𝑒𝑟!"                                                             (2)  
                                                                                         + 𝑏𝑖𝑟𝑡ℎ  𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑦  𝐹𝐸′𝑠   +   𝑏𝑖𝑟𝑡ℎ  𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟  𝐹𝐸′𝑠 +    𝜖!"   

this   equation   is   similar   to   equation   (1)   except   that   it   does   not   impose   a  

linear   relationship   between   early-­‐‑life   typhoid   exposure   and   adult  

outcomes.  We  non-­‐‑parametrically  estimate  the  relationship  between  early-­‐‑

life  typhoid  exposure  and  adult  outcomes  using  linear  partial  regression.  

However,   this   requires   a   strict   ordering   of   early-­‐‑life   typhoid   rates.   We  

achieve   this   by   collapsing   the   data   at   the   city-­‐‑year   level. 17   Since   we  

collapse   at   the   city-­‐‑year   level,  𝑏𝑙𝑎𝑐𝑘!"   becomes   the   percent   of   the   cohort  

born   in   city   j   during   year   k   that   is   black,   and  𝑏𝑖𝑟𝑡ℎ  𝑜𝑟𝑑𝑒𝑟!"   becomes   the  

average  birth  order  for  individuals  born  in  city  j  during  year  k.

If  we  did  not  collapse  at  the  city-­‐‑year  level,  then  there  would  be  many  individuals  with  
the  same  early-­‐‑life  typhoid  rates,  and  the  estimates  would  be  sensitive  to  the  sorting

attainment  above  the  10th  percentile  of  the  early-­‐‑life  typhoid  distribution.  

Moreover  the  relationship  is  approximately  linear.  Moving  from  the  top  of  

the  typhoid  distribution  to  eradication  would  have  increased  educational  

attainment   by   one-­‐‑third   of   a   year   and   increased   earnings   by   about   four  

percent.   There   does,   however,   appear   to   be   a   positive   relationship  

between  zero  and  20  deaths  per  100,000,  but  this  constitutes  less  than  ten  

percent   of   our   sample.18     Overall   then,   it   appears   that   the   linear   model  

adopted  in  section  IV.a.  is  appropriate.

                           One   might   be   concerned   that   typhoid   during   early   life   is  

endogenous.   For   example,   investment   in   water   filtration   might   be  

correlated   with   unobservable   investments   that   also   increase   human  

capital.  To  address  this  concern,  we  implement  an  instrumental  variables  

strategy.  This  strategy  builds  on  the  following  logic:  because  typhoid  is  a  

waterborne  disease,  cities  that  dump  their  sewage  into  a  river  will  increase  

future  typhoid  rates  for  cities  downstream.  Additionally,  the  typhoid  rates  

in   cities   upstream   should   be   exogenous   to   human   capital   investments   in  

the  receiving  city.  


                           Eighteen   of   the   75   cities   used   in   the   previous   analysis   lie  

downstream   from   another   city   for   which   we   have   typhoid   data.   We  

confirm   flow   direction   for   each   river   using   data   from   the   United   States

Geological  Survey.19  Cities  that  are  upstream  (the  feeder  cities)  dump  their  

sewage   into   the   river.   This   increases   the   typhoid   rates   in   cities  

downstream  (the  receiving  city).  Thus,  we  use  typhoid  rates  in  the  feeder  

city   an   instrument   for   typhoid   rates   in   the   receiving   city.   Whether   we  

should  use  contemporaneous  typhoid  rates  or  the  rates  lagged  by  one  year  

depends   on   the   distance   between   the   two   cities   and   the   flow   rate   of   the  

river.   We   find   similar   results   regardless   of   whether   we   use   the  

contemporaneous   or   lagged   typhoid   rate,   but   lagged   typhoid   rates  

produce  a  stronger  first  stage.  


                           Table   4   presents   our   results   using   lagged   typhoid   rates   in   the  

feeder  city  as  an  instrument  for  typhoid  rates  in  the  receiving  city.  Lagged  

typhoid  rates  in  the  feeder  city  are  a  strong  predictor  of  typhoid  rates  in  

the   receiving   city;   an   additional   100   deaths   per   100,000   in   the   feeder   city  

increases  the  typhoid  death  rate  in  the  receiving  city  by  8  in  the  following  

year.   The   F-­‐‑statistics   associated   with   this   estimate   range   from   517.81   to  

671.12  and  therefore  suggest  that  lagged  typhoid  rates  from  the  feeder  city  

are   a   strong   instrument.   In   the   second   stage   we   find   that   typhoid   rates  

during   early   life   decrease   educational   attainment   and   earnings,   although  

only   the   first   estimate   is   statistically   significant   at   the   five   percent   level.  

The  estimate  on  earnings,  while  imprecisely  estimated,  is  consistent  with  

the   OLS   estimates   presented   in   Table   3.   These   results   indicate   that   the  

eradication   of   typhoid   would   have   increased   schooling   by   nine   months.  

Table   4   also   indicates   that   high   typhoid   rates   during   early   life   reduced

                             V.  COST-­‐‑BENEFIT  ANALYSIS  


         The   previous   section   illustrates   that   eradicating   typhoid   fever  

would  have  increased  educational  attainment  by  one  to  nine  months  and  

income   by   one   to   nine   percent.   These   estimates   raise   the   question   of  

whether   the   net   present   value   of   the   increase   in   wages   was   enough   to  

offset   the   costs   associated   with   eradicating   typhoid   fever.   Cutler   and  

Miller   (2005)   have   analyzed   the   benefits   of   adopting   water   purification  

technologies  using  the  value  of  a  statistical  life  and  find  that  the  benefits  

outweigh   the   costs   by   a   ratio   of   23   to   1.   In   our   analysis,   we   ignore   the  

gains   from   additional   life   years   and   instead   focus   on   whether   the  

discounted   increase   in   earnings   would   have   been   sufficient   to   cover   the  

costs  of  eradicating  typhoid  fever.  


         To   analyze   the   benefits   from   typhoid   eradication,   we   need   the  

following   information:   the   probability   that   an   individual   survives   to   a  

given  age  with  and  without  the  intervention,  average  income  by  age  with  

and   without   the   intervention,   and   the   number   of   individuals   in   a   cohort  

who  would  benefit  from  the  water  infrastructure.  To  analyze  the  costs,  we  

need   to   know   the   total   costs   of   municipal   water   systems   and   how  

frequently   these   systems   need   to   be   replaced.   Lastly,   to   compare   the   net  

present  values,  we  need  real  interest  rates.    




                                                  21  
  


                           The   survival   probability,  𝑆! ,   is   the   probability   that   an   individual  

survives  to  age  a.  We  use  the  survival  probabilities  for  males  born  in  1900  

from   the   Social   Security   life   tables.   Cutler   and   Miller   (2005)   find   that  

mortality   fell   by   13%   after   the   introduction   of   clean   water   technologies.  

Accordingly,   we   adjust   the   1900   survival   probabilities   to   reflect   this  

change.   We   use   the   1940   census   to   obtain   the   wage   profile   for   males.  

Specifically,   we   obtain   average   earnings   by   age   using   a   local   polynomial  

smooth   for   all   males.   For   the   counterfactual   wage   distribution,   we   scale  

these  averages  by  one  to  nine  percent,  which  corresponds  to  the  OLS  and  

IV   estimates   reported   in   Tables   3   and   4.   Figure   8   plots   the   baseline   and  

counterfactual   survival   probabilities   as   well   as   the   baseline   and  

counterfactual  wages.  Eradicating  typhoid  fever  has  two  effects  on  wages.  

First,   it   increases   the   average   wage.   Second,   it   increases   the   probability  

that  an  individual  will  survive  until  that  age.  


                           We  assume  that  the  average  cohort  of  males  born  in  a  city  is  20,000,  

which   is   approximately   the   number   of   males   born   in   Chicago   in   1900.20  

Finally,   to   obtain   the   costs   we   use   the   numbers   reported   in   Cutler   and  

Miller  (2005),  which  assumes  that  the  average  cost  of  the  waterworks  for  a  

large   city   was   22.8   million   dollars   in   1940   and   that   the   waterworks   must  

be  replaced  every  ten  years.    


                           The   previous   assumptions   underestimate   the   gains   from  

eradicating   typhoid   fever.   First,   we   assume   that   female   earnings   were  

unaffected   by   typhoid.   Second,   we   assume   that   the   only   benefit   from  

                                                                                                                
   We  obtain  20,000  by  taking  the  number  of  males  in  Chicago  that  were  age  0  in  the  
20

IPUMS  5%  sample  of  the  1900  census  and  multiplying  it  by  20.  




                                                                                                                   22  
  


reduced   mortality   was   increasing   the   probability   of   receiving   future  

earnings.   Third,   we   assume   that   the   entire   waterworks   must   be   replaced  

every   ten   years,   when   in   reality   many   parts   are   likely   to   function   for  

longer.   Furthermore,   we   assume   that   the   construction   of   the   waterworks  

was   necessary   to   eradicate   typhoid   fever,   but   one   could   argue   that   the  

marginal  cost  of  chlorinating  or  filtering  water  was  sufficient  to  eradicate  

typhoid  fever.  


         We   calculate   the   benefits   to   eradicating   typhoid   fever   using  

equation   three,   where  𝑆! !   is   the   counterfactual   survival   probability   and  

𝑊! !   is   the   counterfactual   wage.   The   waterworks   lasts  𝑇  years,  𝑁  is   the  

cohort  size,  and  𝑟  is  the  real  interest  rate.

                                      𝑁                 𝑆! ! 𝑊! ! − 𝑆! 𝑊!             (3)  
                    𝑁𝑃𝑉 =                  ∗

Figure  9  graphs  these  benefits  for  various  interest  rates  for  both  the  OLS  

and   IV   counterfactual   wages.   The   horizontal   line   corresponds   to   the   cost  

of  eradicating  typhoid  fever,  22.8  million  in  1940  dollars.  Figure  9  shows  

that  for  our  OLS  estimates  and  any  real  interest  rate  under  seven  percent,  

the   increase   in   earnings   alone   was   sufficient   to   offset   the   cost   of  

eradicating   typhoid   fever.   For   our   IV   estimates,   the   break-­‐‑even   real  

interest  rate  increases  to  ten  percent.  


  


                      VI.  DISCUSSION  AND  CONCLUSION  


         Between  1900  and  1940  mortality  in  the  United  States  fell  by  nearly  

40  percent.  Approximately  half  of  this  decline  was  the  result  of  investment  


                                                 23  
  


in   water   purification   technologies   and   the   eradication   of   waterborne  

diseases   such   as   typhoid   fever.   There   have   been   a   number   of   previous  

studies  estimating  the  social  rate  of  return  to  water  purification  measures,  

but   all   of   these   studies   focus   on   the   gains   associated   with   reductions   in  

mortality  (e.g.,  Cutler  Miller  2005;  Ferrie  and  Troesken  2008).    Yet  because  

typhoid  was  such  a  virulent  disease  and  had  such  a  low  case  fatality  rate,  

there  is  good  reason  to  believe  that  its  effects  on  morbidity  and  long-­‐‑term  

human  capital  formation  were  substantial.    Accordingly,  in  this  paper,  we  

explore   how   eliminating   early-­‐‑life   exposure   to   typhoid   fever   affected  

economic   outcomes   in   later   life.      Our   laboratory   consists   of   urban  

residents   in   large   American   cities   during   the   late-­‐‑nineteenth   and   early  

twentieth  century.  

        In  our  analysis,  we  explore  how  early  life  exposure  to  typhoid  fever  

(our  primary  indicatory  of  water  quality)  influenced  later  life  outcomes  in  

terms   of   income,   educational   attainment,   home   ownership,   and  

geographic   mobility.      Using   parametric,   semi-­‐‑parametric,   and   IV  

approaches,   our   results   indicate   that   the   eradication   of   typhoid   fever,  

which   cities   achieved   by   adopting   clean   water   technologies,   would   have  

increased   educational   attainment   by   one   to   nine   months   and   earnings  

would   have   increased   by   between   one   and   nine   percent.   A   simple   cost-­‐‑

benefit   analysis   reveals   that   the   increase   in   earnings   from   eradicating  

typhoid   fever   was   more   than   sufficient   to   offset   the   costs   of   eradication.    

When  one  considers  that  our  calculations  ignore  the  changes  in  mortality  

captured  by  Cutler  and  Miller  (2005)  and  other  researchers,  the  evidence  

that  investments  in  water  purification  have  very  high  rates  of  social  return  

seems  unassailable.    These  results  have  important  policy  implications  for  




                                               24  
  


developing   countries   that   have   yet   to   adopt   water   purification  

technologies.

     Notes:  Age,  education,  income,  homeowner  status,  and  whether  the  individual  moved  
     from  their  birth  city  are  taken  from  the  1940  census.  Birth  order  was  reported  in  the  1900  
     census.  Although  the  maximum  of  91  is  likely  a  typographical  error,  the  99th  percentile  
     of  birth  order,  which  is  10,  is  plausible.  Typhoid  rate  during  early  life  is  the  average  
     typhoid  rate  in  the  birth  city  from  one  year  before  birth,  the  year  of  birth,  and  one  year  
     after  birth.
