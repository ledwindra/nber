    "abstract": "\n\nWe argue that the pervasive practice of evaluating portfolio managers relative to a benchmark has real e\ufb00ects. Benchmarking generates additional, inelastic demand for assets inside the benchmark. This leads to a \u201cbenchmark inclusion subsidy:\u201d a \ufb01rm inside the benchmark values an investment project more than the one outside. The same wedge arises for valuing M&A, spino\ufb00s, and IPOs. This overturns the proposition that an investment\u2019s value is independent of the entity considering it. We describe the characteristics that determine the subsidy, quantify its size (which could be large), and identify empirical work supporting our model\u2019s predictions.\n\n",
