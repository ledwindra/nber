THE DEMAND FOR MONEY IN THE U.S. DURING THE GREAT DEPRESSION:
ESTIMATES AND COMPARISON WITH THE POST WAR EXPERIENCE

ABSTRACT

This study investigates the equilibrium demand for narrowly defined

monetary aggregate during the Great Depression. We find evidence in
support of a stable demand for real balance, but rio evidence in support

of stable demand functions for real currency and real monetary base.

This is consistent with the Friedman-Schwartz interpretation of this
period.

We

not reject the hypothesis that the equilibrium demand for real

Ml is stable between the pre and post WWII sample periods. We find that

the "shift in the drift" of Ml velocity after 1945 and at the end of
1981 as well as the "shift in the drift" of currency and base velocities
in 1981 is the image of corresponding "shift in the drift" of short-term

interest rates.

We interpret this as consistent with the hypothesis

that the dramatic change in velocity patterns after WWII and in 1981

result

from changes in inflationary expectations.

Analyses by Lucas (1988], McCallum and Goodfriend (1987] and
McCallum (1989) establish a microeconomic equilibrium relationship
between real balances, short-term interest rates and a measure of the

volume of transactions for a utility maximizing consumer unit. Lucas
[1988] argues that it is appropriate to interpret the demand in real

balances as proportional to "real permanent income" (p. 154) and to
regard this as a relation that "will be stable over time provided only
that preferences are, and that the trading technology.., is stable" (p.
153)

In a recent paper (Hoffman and Rasche [1989)), we have
investigated the nature and stability of the long—run or equilibrium
aggregate demand functions for both Ml and the adjusted monetary base

in the United States during the post-Accord period. We utilize actual
real (personal) income as a measure of transactions volume, however,

since we are concerned with equilibrium states, it is appropriate to
interpret our estimate of the income elasticity as equal to that of

real "permanent income." This study extends that analysis to the
period of the Great Depression (January, 1929 through February,

1

1942) .

In

section I we review briefly the statistical methodology we

apply to the estimation of income and interest elasticities in

equilibrium money demand functions. In section II the sources of the
various data series used in this study are discussed. In Section iii
we present the results of our estimations for the period of the Great

Depression. In section IV we present reestimates of our previous
results using data series that are comparable to those available for

the 1930s, and compare the results of the reestimation to the

estimates for the Great Depression. In section V we discuss the
observed changes in velocity drift that occurred at the end of World

War II and in 1981 in terms of our estimated equilibrium money demand

functions. In section VI, some implications for monetary policy of
our "shift in velocity drift" hypothesis are discussed.

Finally, in

section VII a summary of our major conclusions is presented.

I. Estimation and Testing Methodology
The notion of cointegration is formalized for the general case by

Engle and Granger (1987]. For the purpose at hand, a set of variables
which are integrated of order one are said to be cointegrated if there
exists one or more linear combinations
(cointegratjng vectors) of
these variables that are integrated of order zero.

Recent papers by Johansen [1988, 1989a], and Johansen and
Juselius [1989] develop tests for both the number of cointegrating
vectors and tests of hypotheses regarding elements of the

to rewrite a

covariance matrix of /3.

II. Data
The data for the pre World War II period used in this study are
monthly observations on Ml, the currency component of the

money stock,
the Adjusted Monetary Base, Personal Income, the Consumer Price Index,

the commercial paper rate, and the long-term Aaa bond rate. The first
six of these series are seasonally adjusted. Ml
and currency are
taken from Friedman and Schwartz (1970), Table I. Data on the
adjusted monetary base were supplied by the Federal Reserve Bank of
St. Louis. The personal income data are obtained from National Income
Supplement, Survey of Current Business, 1954, pp 238_42.2 There is no

monthly deflator for personal consumption expenditures for this
period, so we have used the consumer price index to deflate all of the
monetary aggregates and to construct a measure of real personal

income. Treasury bill rates and long-term government rates comparable
to those observed in the post-war period are not available, so we have

21t would be extremely interesting to extend the sample back
through the 1920s. Unfortunately, the available personal income
data begin in January, 1929. Prior to this only fragments of the
data base used to construct the monthly personal income estimates
for the l930s are available. We are investigating the possibility
of constructing a monthly personal income series for the l920s at
the present time using the fragmentary data that is available. For
the details on the construction of monthly personal
income
estimates from 1929 see Nathan and Cone
[1938).

utilized the commercial paper and Aaa bond rates instead.3 In section
III we show that the interpretation of our earlier estimates for the

post—war period is not sensitive to the use of the short-term private
rates rather than the Treasury bill rate during that period though
there are significant differences between the Aaa rate and the 10 year
Treasury rate.

The sample period of this study ends in February, 1942. This
date was chosen because the Federal Reserve implemented a policy of
pegging the Treasury Bill rate as part of the wartime finance effort
in March, 1943 (Goldfeld and Chandler [1986), P. 541).

A critical assumption that underlies our tests for cointegration
and estimation of the equilibrium income and interest elasticities of
the demand for money is that the time series under consideration are
not stationary in levels (or log—levels), but achieve stationarity

when first differenced. (The time series must be "difference
stationary" (Nelson and Plosser [1982]) or integrated of order 1

(Engle and Granger [1987))). Thus it is critical to check the
statistical properties of the time series used in the following

analysis. In Table 1 the results of a battery of unit root tests on
these data series and their log differences are presented. The tests
uniformly fail to reject the hypothesis of a unit root in the log-

levels of all the data series used in this analysis. The relevant

term structure of government rates from January, 1929 through
December, 1949.

do not provide a consistent series for our purposes.

subset of the unit root tests (i.e. excluding those that assume a
deterministic trend in the data) applied to the log first differences
of the various data series stroncly reject the hypothesis of a unit

root in any of these differences data. Therefore, we conclude that
there is no evidence to contradict the assumption that these data
series are integrated of order 1 during the period under
consideration.

III. Tests for Coirttegratjon 1929—42.

The test for a log-linear cointegrating vector among the three
nonstationary variables, real Ml, real personal income, and the

commercial paper rate is presented in the top part of Table 2. We
present results of the test using the residuals from augmented vector

autoregressions of lengths 4 and 7. The computed values of the
Jorgensen test statistics fail to reject the hypothesis of one or
fewer cointegrating vectors against the alternatives of stationarity

.5 under the trace test) and two cointegrating vectors (p > .5
for the computed values of 6.48 - .83 = 5.65 {k=4} and 8.14 — .50 =
7.64 {k=7} under the maximum eigenvalue test). The computed values of
(p >

the maximum eigenvalue test statistic for the maintained hypothesis of
zero cointegrating vectors against the alternative hypothesis of one
cointegrating vector are 28.83 —

6.48 = 22.35 {k=4} and 28.54 - 8.14 =

20.46 {k=7}. In both cases .10 > p

>

.05 which we interpret as

consistent with the conclusion that there is a single cointegrating

vector among the three variables. Furthermore, the estimated elements
of the unique cointegrating vector are consistent with an
interpretation as an equilibrium demand function for real balances.

The coefficient on real income has the Opposite sign to that on real

Ml, and is of roughly the same absolute value. The coefficient on the
log of the commercial paper rate has the same sign as the coefficient

of real Ml but is smaller in magnitude. A further test that the real
Ml and real income coefficients are equal in absolute value does not

reject this restriction. Thus, as in the post-war data used in
Hoffman and Rasche [1989), the conclusion that the equilibrium demand

for real Ml is a velocity function cannot be rejected. Under the
velocity constraint, the implied interest elasticity of the demand for
real Ml is .45 as indicated in Table 2.

The estimate of the interest elasticity of the equilibrium
velocity relationship here is remarkably close to that reported in

Hoffman and Rasche [1989) for the post-war period. This is
particularly remarkable in light of the different ranges of variation
of short-term interest rates during the two sample periods. In the

29-42 sample period the commercial paper rate varied from .5 to 6.25
percent; in the 53-87 sample period the Treasury bill rate varied from

.64 to 16.3 percent. The similarity of the estimated interest
elasticities is not the result of the use of different interest rates

during the two samples. The estimated interest elasticity of the
equilibrium velocity vector for the 53—87 sample period using the
commercial paper rate reported in Table 2 is only marginally larger
than that reported in Hoffman and Rasche [1989] for the Treasury bill

rate. We interpret this as strong evidence in support of the

8

approximate log-linearity of the equilibrium of the aggregate demand
for real Ml in the U.S.4
The results of a test for a cointegrating vector

among the logs
of the three variables real Ml, real personal income and the Aaa

corporate interest rate are given in the bottom part of Table 2, and
contrast sharply with the results for the Commercial paper rate. The
trace and maximum eigenvalue test here fail to reject the hypothesis

of one or fewer cointegrating vectors against the alternatives of
stationarity (p >

.5) and two cointegrating vectors (p >

.5).

However, the maximum eigenvalue test also fails to reject the
hypothesis of zero cointegrating vectors (nonstationari.ty) against the

alternative of one cointegrating vector. The computed values of this
test statistic are 22.38 — 6.73 = 15.65 and 21.54 — 8.37 = 13.17
for

k=4 and 7 respectively (.5 < p <

.8).

Furthermore, where the lag

length is 4, the estimated coefficient on real Ml is extremely small

relative to the coefficients on real income and the Aaa rate, and is
At first glance, the result of the estimation with the Aaa rate
appears disturbing, particularly in light of the result reported in
Hoffman and Rasche [1989) that in the post-war period there are no

They
strongly reject the hypothesis of zero cointegrating vectors in
favor of the alternative of one cointegrating vector. For k=4 the

differences of economic Significance in the estimated cointegrating
vector between real Ml, real income and Treasury bill rate compared

with the estimated cointegrating vector between real Ml, real income

and the 10-year government rate. More detailed consideration suggests
that the differences between the estimates using short-term interest
rates and long-term interest rates found here may be attributable to

measurement errors. First, as discussed in Temin [1976], long-term
corporate interest rates for a particular class of bond ratings are
likely to inadequately reflect changes in risk that occurred at the

depths of the Great Depression. Second, the post-war estimation
reported at the end of Table 2 for the same interest rate series also
fails to support the hypothesis of a cointegrating vector among real

Ml, real income and the Aaa rate. The only change here from the
results reported in Hoffman and Rasche [1989) is the substitution of

the Aaa rate for the 10 year government rate. In the latter case,
there is substantial evidence in support of a cointegrating vector

involving long-term interest rates. These results suggest that the
specification of equilibrium money demand equations for the U.S. with
short-term interest rates are more robust than with long—term interest

rates. This is consistent with the conclusion of an early
investigation by Laidler [1966].

A particular interesting test is to examine the data from the
Great Depression period for the monetary base and the currency

component of Ml. In our previous study of post—war data, Hoffman and
Rasche (1989), we found that a single cointegrating vector can be

meaningfully interpreted in terms of a demand function for the real
10

base. The same result is replicated with the commercial paper rate in
Table 3. In addition, the evidence strongly supports the hypothesis
of a unique cointegrating vector among real currency, real income, and
the conunercial paper rate in the post—Accord period (Table 3).

Friedman and Schwartz [1963] argue that the demand function for
money (in their definition M2) was stable during the Great Depression,

but that the banking panics during 1931-33 provoked massive portfolio
shifts out of bank deposits into currency. Under this hypothesis, we
expect that our statistical techniques should fail to find a

cointegrating vector during the interwar sample period between either
the real monetary base or real currency holdings and real income and
interest rates, whose estimated coefficients are consistent with the
parameters of demand functions for these aggregates.

The results of these tests are reported in Table 3. The results
using the corporate bond rate and either the real monetary base or
real currency holdings are similar to those for real Ml in Table 2:
the data reject even a single cointegrating vector among the three

variables. The results of the estimations using the commercial paper
rate fail to reject conclusively the hypothesis of a single
cointegrating vector among the three variables.5 However, this
evidence does not support the hypothesis of a stable demand function

for these two aggregates during this period. In all four cases
considered in Table 3, the estimated coefficient on real income in the

cointegrating vector is very small, both in absolute value and
relative to the estimated coefficient on the real monetary aggregate.

In all four cases the estimated real income coefficients are not

significantly different from zero. Furthermore, in three of the four
cases using the commercial paper rate, the estimated coefficient on
real income has the same sign as the estimated coefficient on the real
monetary aggregate, contrary to the hypothesized demand function with

a positive real income elasticity. Thus we conclude that the results
of our statistical procedures support the Friedman—Schwartz hypothesis
that the demand function for money (in this case Ml) was stable during
the Great Depression, but at the same time the demand functions for
real currency balances and the real adjusted monetary base were not
stable during the banking panics.

Unfortunately, we do not know the true value of the A1, but have

only the estimates of these matrices shown in Table 4. The approach
used here is a single iteration procedure: first construct the
estimated transformation matrices, Q1, from the estimated covariance
matrices,

and then apply these transformation matrices to the

original data. Then the maximized values of the concentrated
likelihood functions,

are used to compute the value of

matrices across the two samples, hence

we conclude that we cannot reject the hypothesis of a stable
equilibrium demand function for real Ml over the entire 1929-87
period.

An alternative test of the equality of cointegrating vectors in
the inter and postwar periods may be obtained by forming a Wald test
that relies on the distributional properties of the cointegrating

vector estimates. Johansen (l989b) provides an expression for the
asymptotic distribution of a normalized vector of cointegrating

parameter estimates. Specifically, select a normalization;

where C=(IrO) Then T(cflc) is asymptotically mixed

estimated by

these distributional properties to calculate a Wald statistic of the
form
(23)

T(KIVec{$c_ac})1(Knx)(Kuvec{c_Ø})

that is distributed as X2dj• The restrictions must be imposed on
the normalized cointegrating vector to ensure that they are
effectively constraints on ii.

Our interest is to test the equality of the parameters of the
cointegrating vectors that prevail in the inter and postwar periods.

We form the Wald test by first augmenting the interwar series with 420
"zeros" and adding 158 "zeros" at the outset of each postwar series.
The six variables formed in this manner may then be subjected to the

Johansen procedure outlined above.7 We know from Table 2 that two
cointegrating vectors prevail in this system and joint estimation
allows us to test hypotheses among elements of the two vectors.

The

estimated cointegrating vectors and associated standard errors appear

in Table 5. The estimates obtained in the joint estimation using Mlmoney and commercial paper rates are very similar to those obtained in

Table 2 with the two distinct "money demand" vectors appearing in the
normalized vectors.
The Wald tests are designed to test the equality of the two free

parameters across the two vectors. For the k=4 specification the
X2(2) statistic is .435 and for k=7, the value is 1.427. We conclude

that we cannot reject the hypothesis of a stable equilibrium demand
function for real Ml over the entire 1929—1987 period.

V. Stable Equilibrium Demand and "Shifts in Velocity Drift"
It is well documented that during the post-Accord period in the
United States, the velocity of both Ml (as presently measured) and the
monetary base behave like a random walks with drift.

(Haraf [1986),

Rasche (1987), (1988)). This statistical model is stable through late
1981. Beginning in 1982, a substantial change occurs in the drift
parameter. Subsequently, both measures of velocity behave like random
walks without significant drift.

This is not the first time that this phenomenon has occurred.
Friedman and Schwartz (1963) refer to a change in the trend of

velocity at the end of World War II. While their focus is on M2 (as
they measured it; not as currently measured by the Board of
Governors), they also show that the velocity of Ml displays the same

change in trend. In light of the work of Gould and Nelson (1974) it
is more appropriate to characterize these post World War II phenomena

as changes in the drift of an 1(1) process. This post-war change in
the behavior of velocity has gone largely unexplained.

The 1981 "shift in the drift" is the source of the widespread
conclusion that there no longer exists a stable relationship between
the nominal money supply and nominal measures of economic activity.

The alleged breakdown of a stable relationship between such narrowly
defined monetary aggregates and measures of economic activity is the
official rationale given by the FOMC for the downgrading of Ml to the
status of a "monitored" aggregate and the readoption of a borrowed
19

reserves (or free reserves) Operating procedure for the conduct of

monetary policy in the fall of 1982. (Volcker [1983), Wallich (1984),
Heller, (1988])

Numerous hypotheses have been proposed as explanations for the
abrupt change in the behavior of velocity measures in the early 1980s

(Rasche (1987], Stone and Thornton [1987)). However, substantive
explanations that are consistent with the observed statistical
properties of the data have eluded analysts.

The problem here is to reconcile the two well documented shifts
in velocity drift with the single cointegrating vector between real

Ml, real personal income, and the commercial paper rate that is

presented in this study. Since we do not reject the hypothesis that
the equilibrium real income elasticity of the demand for real Ml is
unity, the existence of a single cointegrating vector implies that
there is only one independent trend between the velocity of Ml and the
commercial paper rate over the entire period 29-42 and 53-87.

Similarly, there is only one independent trend between base and
currency velocities and the Treasury bill rate (or the commercial

paper rate) in the post—war period). This implies that the observed
drift in any of the velocities is proportional to the drift in the
corresponding nominal interest rate during the respective sample

periods (Engle and Yoo [1987]. Thus any "shift in the drift" of these
velocity measures is the image of a shift in the drift of nominal
interest rates.

These conclusions are verified by the tests reported in Table 5.

There regressions are presented for log changes of Ml velocity and the
20

commercial paper rate against a constant and two dummy variables (D45,
D82). The first of these dummies is zero through February, 1942 and

1.0 thereafter. The second is zero through December, 1981 and 1.0
thereafter. The results for velocity clearly indicate

a strong upward

shift in the drift after WWII, and the decline after 1981. The
results indicate that the commercial paper rate also shows shifts in
the drift in the same direction as the velocity shifts, but these
shifts are not measured with as much precision because of the high
variance in short-term interest rates.
Linear restrictions on the estimated coefficients across the two

equations are tested using seemingly unrelated regression estimation
(SUR). These linear restrictions are determined by the estimated
equilibrium interest elasticity of Ml from Table 4.
The drift restrictions implied by the cointegrating vector for

real balances are not rejected. Thus we conclude that the shifts in
velocity drift that are observed for Ml after WWII and after 1981 are
the images of corresponding shifts in the drift of nominal interest
rates at those times and are consistent with a stable equilibrium
demand function for real balances.
An additional hypothesis is that the drift in Ml velocity after

1981 is zero (Rasche (1988)). If this is true, then the equilibrium
demand function for real balances implies that the drift in nominal

interest rates after 1981 is also zero. This adds an additional
(fourth) restriction across the estimated regression coefficients, and

leaves only one independent parameter in the regressions. Tests of
the four joint restrictions are presented in Table 6. Again the data
21

do not reject the linear restrictions implied by the equilibrium
demand for real balances, nor do they reject the hypothesis that the
drifts in the two variables are zero subsequent to

An even stronger test can be constructed in the same fashion for

the post-war data. After 1981 there is a significant shift in the
drift of Ml velocity, base velocity, and currency velocity (Rasche

t1987]). The evidence in Table 3 strongly supports a single
cointegrating vector for both base velocity and currency velocity

during the post-war period. If these results are consistent, then the
same linear restrictions among the drift of Ml velocity, base

velocity, currency velocity and the commercial paper rate must hold

jointly both before and after 1981. A test of the six cross equation
restrictions is presented in Table 7. The data do not reject the
restrictions implied by the cointegration vectors [x2 =

9.81;

p =

13).
VI. mp1ications for Disinflationary Monetary Policy
These results reported in the previous section help sort out the
numerous hypotheses that prevail about the change in velocity behavior

in the l980s. Nine such hypotheses are outlined in Rasche (1987].
Many of those hypotheses are inconsistent with the evidence presented

in that analysis. The remaining hypotheses not conclusively ruled out

3The autocorrelation function of monthly log changes in the
commercial paper rate suggests that this series is IMA(1). This
is indicated in Table 6 by the low Durbin-Watson statistic. The
dummy variables in Table 6 have been incorporated in a VAR of
length 4 (corresponding to k=4) and the tests of the cross equation

restrictions have been replicated in these models.
results are the same as in the simple regressions.
22

The test

by the earlier analysis are not consistent with stable

equilibrium
demand functions for real Ml, real currency, and the real base before
and after 1982.

One hypothesis which is investigated indirectly in

Rasche [1987]
and received little support, is that the observed change in velocity
behavior is the result of a break in inflation expectations. In the

absence of direct effects of measures of expected inflation rates in

the demand for real balances, there is no intuitive explanation of how
such a break generates a shift in the drift of the velocity measures.
The realization that the shift velocity drift is just the image
of a shift in the drift of nominal interest
rates provides the missing
intuition for the expected inflation hypothesis.

If the post-Accord

period through 1980 is characterized by a steady upward drift in
inflation expectations, then it is reasonable to conjecture that this
drift is reflected in a positive drift in nominal interest rates. If
the inflation expectations stabilized during the 1981-2 recession, and
subsequently remain stable, then a reasonable conjecture is that there
is no drift in nominal interest rates in the 1980s. This inflation
expectations hypothesis is also a plausible rationale for the increase
in Ml velocity drift after WWII compared to the earlier experience.
One source of evidence consistent with the hypothesis of a break
in the drift in inflation expectations around the end of 1981 is the

Livingston survey data on inflation expectations. The survey dates
from the late l940s and is plotted in Figure 1 beginning in 1954. The
data are on one year ahead inflation expectations formed at the end of

23

the previous year.9 The series shows a general upward trend through
1980 and then breaks sharply downward. Since 1982 the series has
fluctuated without trend in the 3-5 percent range.1°

If published inflation forecasts are taken as representative of
inflation expectations there is a second source of evidence in support
of a break in drift of inflation expectations in the 1981-82 period.

The annual CEA forecasts of the GNP deflator, as tabulated by McNees

(1988], trend steadily upward from 1962 through 1981. Then the
forecast rates drop precipitously in 1981-2 and stabilize in the 3-4

percent range through 1987. The forecasts for 1988 and 1989 in the
respective Annual Reports of the Council of Economic Advisors are 3.9

and 3.7 percent respectively. Belongia [1988] analyzes GNP deflator
forecasts for the 1976—87 period from five sources: the CEA, the CBO,
the ASA/NBER survey panel, and from two major economic consulting

firms. He finds that the forecasts of the latter four sources closely
parallel those of the CEA. Thus the historical ex—ante inflation
forecasts are consistent with the hypothesis that inflation
expectations stabilized in the early 1980s and have not drifted since.
This interpretation suggests that there are "Lucas effects"
associated with the implementation of a credible disinflationary

monetary policy. Under this hypothesis, when agents come to believe

9The data from the Livingston survey are provided by the
research department of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.

101t would be interesting to know if these inflation
expectations series are "trend stationary" or "difference
stationary". With only about 30 observations, it is unlikely that

any test of the unit root hypothesis provides a reliable
discrimination between the two alternatives.
24

that the monetary policy regime has switched from one which permits
accelerating inflation, to one of stable or decelerating inflation,

then the monetary authorities should expect that there will be a
change in the average growth rate of velocity of narrowly defined

monetary aggregates. If this average growth rate declines, then it
will not be necessary to slow the growth of the monetary aggregates as
much as appears from an examination of the historical data generated

by the accelerating inflation policy regime in order to accomplish the

objective of a constant or declining rate of inflation. For example,
using the data from the 60s and 70s it was generally believed that to
stabilize the inflation rate at four percent per annum, the Fed would
have to achieve a long—run growth rate of the monetary base of the

order of four percent per annum to allow for the historica. drift of

base velocity of around two percent. If agents come to believe that
inflation is stabilized, and this in turn eliminates the drift of base

velocity, then reducing the long-run growth rate of the monetary base
to only six percent per annum will accomplish the objective of a
stable inflation at a four percent rate.

VII. Conclusions
The evidence examined here supports the hypothesis that there has
been a stable equilibrium demand for real Ml balance over the entire

period 1929-87. The evidence also supports the Friedman-Schwartz
hypothesis that the demand for real balances (here Ml) remained stable
throughout the Great Contraction although the banking panics during
that period provoked portfolio shift out of demand deposits and into
currency such that there is no meaningful equilibrium demand function
25

for either the monetary base or currency during that period. Stable
demand functions for those latter aggregates are present in the postwar period.

Our analysis also suggests an explanation for the observed
changes in reduced form equations relating various monetary aggregates
to nominal measures of economic activity that occurred after World War

II and again in 1982. The data and analysis are consistent with the
hypothesis that such changes in reduced form relationships occur when

there are distinct changes in inflation expectations. While further
research is needed to validate this conclusion, the results of this
study conclusively retect that the hypothesis that financial
innovation and financial deregulation are significant distabilizing
factors for the demand for narrowly defined real balances in the
198 Os.
