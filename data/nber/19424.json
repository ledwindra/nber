    "abstract": "\n\nAre teachers' impacts on students' test scores (\"value-added\") a good measure of their quality? This question has sparked debate partly because of a lack of evidence on whether high value-added (VA) teachers who raise students' test scores improve students' long-term outcomes. Using school district and tax records for more than one million children, we find that students assigned to high-VA teachers in primary school are more likely to attend college, earn higher salaries, and are less likely to have children as teenagers. Replacing a teacher whose VA is in the bottom 5% with an average teacher would increase the present value of students' lifetime income by approximately $250,000 per classroom.\n\n",

This paper is the second of two companion papers on teacher quality. The results in the two papers were previously combined in NBER Working Paper No. 17699, entitled \"The Long-Term Impacts of Teachers: Teacher Value-Added and Student Outcomes in Adulthood,\" issued in December 2011. On May 4, 2012, Ra j Chetty was retained as an expert witness by Gibson, Dunn, and Crutcher LLP to testify about the importance of teacher effectiveness for student learning in Vergara v. California based on the findings in NBER Working Paper No. 17699. John Friedman is currently on leave from Harvard, working at the National Economic Council; this work does not represent the views of the NEC. All results based on tax data contained in this paper were originally reported in an IRS Statistics of Income white paper (Chetty, Friedman, and Rockoff 2011a).
