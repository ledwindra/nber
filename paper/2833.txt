Although theoretical papers have noted the potentially
important distinction hetween annual and lifetime tax burdens,
with one exception the lifetime perspective is absent in empirical studies of tax incidence.1

Calculations based on annual

income may provide particularly unreliable guidance on a central
tax policy issues of the early 1990s:

the incidence of excise

Conventional wisdom holds that these taxes are regres-

sive, falling most heavily on the poorest households.

This has

long been one of the central objections to proposals for raising
excise taxes.

Nevertheless, the evidence for this view may

depend critically on the rime horizon in incidence studies.
Pechman (1985, p.51) writes thst "whether regressivity of [sales
and excise] taxes with respect to income would remain for
accounting periods longer than one year is not known. It seems
clear, however, that the regressivity shown at the lowest income
levels on the basis of annual figures would be moderated, if not
completely eliminated, over the longer period."

There is

relatively little systematic evidence, however, evaluating this
conj ecture

'The general equilibrium incidence model of Charles Ballard,
et ml. (1985),
as well the tax burden calculations of Joseph
Pechman (1985), allocate households to categories based on annual
income. The study which does consider lifetime issues, by James
Davies et si. (1984), finds that the choice of time interval can
has important effects on the estimated distribution of Canadian
taxes. Theoretical treatment of lifetime tax issues include
David Levhari and Eytan Sheshinski (1972) and 8. John Driffill
and Harvey Rosen (1983).
2Two recent papers by Frank Sammartino (1988) and Richard
Kasten and Sammartino (1988) recognize the potential importance
of this annual income bias.
They compare expenditures on
particular commodities to total expenditures, and examine the
incidence of taxes on a number of products not discussed in this

The present paper begins by documenting the unsurprising
proposition that household income measured over long horizons is
less variable than annual household income.

This implies that

low-income households in one year have some chance of being
higher-income households in other years.

Thus, even if the share

of income consumed by lowest income groups is higher than that
for higher-income groups, excise taxes or taxes on consumption
more generally may be less regressive than calculations based on
annual income suggest.

The second section explores the differen-

ces between the annual and lifetime incidence by considering the
incidence of excise taxes on gasoline, alcohol, and tobacco.

It

shows that expenditure on these itema as a share of total
consumption is much mote equally distributed than expenditure as
a share of annual income.

If households base their spending

plans on their expected lifetime income, then consumption
provides a more accurate measure of lifetime resources than does
annual income.

From a longer-horizon perspective, these taxes

are therefore much less regressive than is usually thought.
There is a brief conclusion.

I.

Do Lifetime and Annual Incidence Differ?
Many studies provide detailed information on the tax burdens

facing households at different points in the annual income
distribution.

If households stay at the same position in the

income distribution over long periods of time,
paper.

then these

calculations provide teasonable indications of longer-term tax
burdens as well.

Data on incnme dynamics, however, suggest a

surprising degree of instability in the annual income distribution.
Table

presents data on movements up and down the income

distribution by individuals in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics
(PSID).

The entries are transition probabilities relating an

individual's location in the distribution in 1971 to the same
individual's position in 1978.

A randomly-chosen individual had

a 41% chance of being in the same income quintile in these two

years.

The chance that an individual in the lowest income

quintile in 1971 would be there again in 1978 was .54, significantly higher than the one-in-three chance that an individual
near the middle of the income distribution would remain in the
same quintile.3
Substantial instability in the income distribution is
confirmed by evidence from other studies using other data sets.
Frank Hanna (1948),

analyzing Wisconsin income data from the

1929-1935 period, finds markedly less inequality in the distribution of total income over the period than in the distribution of
3Transition data may overstate the true incidence of
mobility since survey data on household income is subject to
measurement error. The magnitude of the overstatement may be
small, however. John Bound and Alan Krueger (1988) find that
only 15% of the cross-sectional variation in reported income in
the Current Population Survey is due to noise. Duncmn and Daniel
Hill (1985) report similarly encouraging results for the PSID.
Both studies also find important positive correlation between the
measurement errors for earnings in adjacent years (.43 in Duncan
and Hill), undermining the common claim that much of the year-toyear variation in reported earnings is due to measurement error.

Paul Taubman (1977) examines mobility in the

NBER-Thorndike/Hagen

data set, which teports earnings in 1969 and

1955 for a sample of 4600 men aged 18-26 in 1943.
ous

This homogene-

sample controls for lifecycle variation in earnings, but

Tauhman nevertheless finds that an individual's chance of falling
in the same earnings decile in 1955 and 1969 is only 22 percent.

Lee Lillard (1977) uses the same data and estimates of the Gini
coefficient for annual income to be .28, significantly larger
than the estimate of .19 for the present value of lifetime
esrntngs

Since studies using annual income data find that the burden
of the U.S. tax system is roughly proportional to income except
at the top and bottom of the income distribution, mobility into
and out of these parts of the income distribution hss the largest
effect on incidence studies. Martha Hill's (1981) study of the
PSID sample finds that one third of the individuals who were in
poverty had not been in poverty the previous year.
results show less mobility:

Taubman's

lowest-earning decile in 1955, and 44 percent of those in the

4Compsrisons of the inequality in lifetime and annual
esrnings hinge critically on the assumed persistence of the
component of individual earnings that cannot be explained by
observsble individual attributes. Roger Gordon (1984) finds very
little difference between the interpersonal distribution of human
wealth and annual earnings, presumsbly because of differences in
his stochastic specification. A detsiled discussion of individual wage histories and their random components is found in the
Report of the Consultant Panel on Social Security (1976), which
reports an autocortelation coefficient of approximately .50 for
an individual's wages at the beginning and end of a decade, after
correcting for economy-wide growth trends.

S

highest decile, were in the same decile again In 1969.
Even modest mobility is sufficient to alter basic incidence
results, particularly regarding excise taxes.

Davies et al.

(1984) find that the average burden of Canadian sales and excise
taxes for the lowest income decile falls from 27% when annual
income is the benchmark to 15% with lifetime incidence (the
average across all groups is 13%)

.

For

the highest income

decile, the excise tax burden rises from 8.5% with annual
incidence to 12% with lifetime incidence.

For the progressive

corporate income tax, lifetime incidence reduces the burden on
top decile households from 10% to 5% and raises the burden on the
lowest decile from one to two percent.
Focusing on lifetime incidence introduces two considerations
that annual incidence calculations omit.

First, lifetime

incidence incorporates predictable lifecycle patterns in earnings, asset accumulation, and consumption, yielding more sensible
inferences with respect to the distribution of tax burdens.

For

example, consider the gasoline excise tax burden on two citydwelling households with no current gasoline expenditures, one a
young couple and the other two elderly pensioners.

While the

annual incidence framework might imply identical burdens on the
two households,

the lifetime approach correctly imputes a higher

burden to the younger couple because they are likely to move to
the suburbs and become substantial gasoline consumers in future

years.
Second, lifetime incidence averages over many years,

6

reducing the importance of variation in annual earnings due to
unemployment or changes in family status.

In practice this

effect is more important than the lifecycle effect in estimating
the distribution of excise tax burdens.

For many low-income

households, current income provides an unreliable indication of
lifetime economic status.5

IT.

Excise Tax Increases: Lifetime and Annual Incidence
The current policy debate aurrounding excise taxes on

gasoline, tobacco, and alcohol provides an excellent illustration
of the differences between annual and lifetime incidence measures.

Table 2 presents the share of gasoline, tobacco, and alcohol

expenditures in annual income (excluding in-kind transfers) and
in

annual consumption for households at various points in the

income and expenditure distribution.

Provided households adhere

to the basic tenets of the lifecycle-permanent income hypothesis
by setting consumption in relation to lifetime resources rather
than current income, total expenditure provides a better measure
of long-term household well-being than annual income.

6

5Pechman (1985) attempts to correct for this problem in
measuring tax burdens on the lowest-income decile. His reported
tax burdens for the lowest decile (first through tenth
tiles) are based on households in the sixth through tenth
deciles
follow standard practice, for example Pechman (1985), in
assuming that excise taxes are fully reflected in consumer
prices. The distribution of expenditures across households
therefore determines the incidence of the tax. The burden on
low-income or low-consumption households would be reduced if the
analysis recognized the indexed nature of most transfer payments,
which provides increased income in response to tax-induced price

Retired in-

burden of some excise taxes may therefore be greater than for
ocher households with similar consumption, although Kasten and
Sammartino (1988) suggest this is not the case for the gasoline,
tobacco,

and alcohol excises.

Additional research is needed to

identify low-mobility groups and measure their tax burdens.
