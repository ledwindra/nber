    "abstract": "\n\nWe review research that measures time preferences\u2014i.e., preferences over intertemporal tradeoffs. We distinguish between studies using financial flows, which we call \u201cmoney earlier or later\u201d (MEL) decisions and studies that use time-dated consumption/effort. Under different structural models, we show how to translate what MEL experiments directly measure (required rates of return for financial flows) into a discount function over utils. We summarize empirical regularities found in MEL studies and the predictive power of those studies. We explain why MEL choices are driven in part by some factors that are distinct from underlying time preferences.\n\n",
