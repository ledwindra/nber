The Effective Tax Rate and the Pretax Rate of Return

ABSTRACT

This paper presents new estimates of the taxes paid on nonfinancial
corporate capital, on the pretax rate of return to capital, and on the
effective tax rate. The basic time series show that both the pretax rate
of return and the effective tax rate have varied substantially in the past
quarter century.
An explicit analysis indicates that, after adjusting for different

aspects of the business cycle, pretax profitability was between one and
1.5 percentage points lower in the l970's than in the l960's. The rate of
profitability in the l960's was also about one—half of a percentage point
greater than the profitability in the 7 years of the l950's after the
Korean war.
Changes in productivity growth, in inflation, in relative unit labor
costs, and in other variables are all associated with changes in

profitability.
None of these variables, however, can explain the differences in profitability
between the l950Ts, l960's and l970's.

Looking at broad decade averages, the effective tax rate and the
pretax rate of return move in opposite directions, higher

pretax profits
occurring when the tax rate is high. There thus appears to have been no

tendency for pretax profits to vary in a way that offsets differences in
effective tax rates.

Section 1 then examines whether there has been a trend in profitability in the
postwar

tors

period

or a tendency for profits to decline in the 1970's. Several fac-

that are potential determinants of corporate profitability, including pro-

ductivity and the ratio of final product prices to intermediate input prices and
unit labor costs, are

then examined in section 5. There

is no evidence

broad fluctuations in the effective tax rate over the past 25 years
setting changes

that the

in the pretax rate of return. Changes in the effective tax rate

were therefore associated with correspondingly large changes in the net rate of
return.

1. State and Local Taxes Paid by Nonfinancial Corporations
In measuring corporate profits, the national income and product

treat state and local property taxes very differently from the profits
taxes levied by all levels of government.1 Pretax profits are defined as profits
accounts

before

corporate income taxes but after all of the state and local property

taxes paid by

corporations.

We believe that this method is conceptually

incorrect and that it significantly distorts the measurement of the national
rate of return on additions to the stock of corporate capital.2

Although

vate

all

of the taxes paid by corporations are costs from the pri-

viewpoint of the shareholders, these taxes do not represent social costs.

1 The term "property tax" refers to taxes levied on the value of physical assets

while "profits taxes" are levied on the income generated from these assets.
2 The national income accounting convention of treating property taxes as a cost
of production rather than as a tax on capital appears to be based on
accepting

the business accounting convention that the property tax is a
"cost" because it is subtracted in calculating business profits; see Ruggles
and Ruggles, 1956. A further reason offered in defense of the conventional
national income accounting method is that the property tax is "an indirect
tax" and therefore presumably has a very different incidence than the direct
capital income taxes; see Ruggles and Ruggles, 1970. We believe that the
property tax and the tax on profits cannot usefully be distinguished in
eit?ier of these ways.

THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE AND
THE PRETAX BATE OF RETURN

Martin Feldstein*

Louis Di cks —Mi rea1x*

This

paper presents new estimates of the pretax rate of return on non—

financial corporate capital in the United States and on the effective rate of

tax paid on that return. We then use these estimates to examine whether there
has been any

systematic

decline in the rate of return and to study the sources

of variation in profitability. Our

estimates

of the rate of profit during the

past quarter century use the most recent national income account revisions and
the latest estimates by the Department of Commerce
Board

and the Federal Reserve

of the stocks of reproducible capital and land. In

addition, we have

developed our own estimates of the property tax paid by nonfinancial cor-

porations to state and local governments, a significant component both of
taxes and of pretax profits that was omitted in all

previous

studies.

These estimates of property taxes and their implications for the pre-

tax rate

of return are discussed in the first two sections of the paper. The

effective

tax rate reflects the taxes paid by corporations, their shareholders

and their creditors to governments at all levels.

Section 3 of the paper

discusses the estimation of these taxes and the implied behavior of the effective tax rate.

Similarly, the taxes paid by business to state and local governments do not

represent charges for benefits received. From

the national viewpoint, the

marginal product of capital is therefore the total addition to national
output
and not that addition net of the taxes levied on capital or
capital income.
A correct measure of capital
productivity therefore requires adding the state

and local property taxes to the national income measure of
pretax income.1 This
section presents alternative estimates of he state and local
property taxes
paid by nonfinancial corporations.
In 1979, state and local

governments collected more than $32 billion

in taxes on the capital or capital income of nonfinancial

includes the state personal income
well as the state and local taxes
local taxes on the capital income

corporations This

taxes on the dividends of shareholders as

on corporate property and profits.

State and

of nonfinancial corporations now exceed 17

percent of real pretax capital income and 70 percent of that income net of
all

federal, state and local taxes. It is clear

from these figures alone that

recognizing state and local taxes is important

for calculating the total effec-

tive tax rate on capital income as well as for assessing the
pretax rate of
return on corporate capital.
Nonfinancial corporations pay two types of state and local taxes that
are based on capital or capital income:

taxes. Since there are no official

corporate profits taxes and property

estimates of either type of tax paid by non-

financial corporations we now describe our own method of

estimation.

This expanded pretax profits differs from the social product of
capital if
there are externalitites, economic
rents, nonconstant returns to scale, or
monopoly power. This distinction will be ignored in the current
paper.

The total corporate profits tax accruals of state and local governments for all types of corporations is calculated by the Department of Commerce
and published in the National Income and Product Accounts.1 The value for 1919

was $13.0 billion. We divide this amount between nonfinancial and financial
corporations in the same ratio as the federal corporate income tax accruals are

divided between these two types of corporations. In 1979, for example, nonfinancial corporations accounted for 80 percent of total federal corpcrate tax

liabilities.2 On the basis of this information, we estimate that the state and
local corporate tax liability for nonfinancial corporations was $10.14 billion.

Similar values forother years since 19148 are shown in column 1 of Table 1.

Note that the tax rose from only $1.1 billion in 1960 to $2.8 billion in 1910
and$l0.14 billion in 1979.

The total value of state and local property tax collections appears
in the national income and product accounts (Table 3) but no distinction is made
between the taxes levied on the property of nonfinancial corporations and the
taxes levied on the property of households, unincorporated businesses and financial

corporations. The total state and local property tax receipts for 1979 were

$614.14

billion. Because calculating the share of property taxes levied on nonfinancial
corporations is difficult, we present three different estimates based on three

different assumptions. All three estimates are based on the Department of
Commerce series of the replacement value of stocks of reproducible physical assets

1 Table 3.14 of the NIPA contains a detailed breakdown of state and local govern—
inent receipts.

2 The total corporate profits tax liability is reported in Table B-l9 of the
1981 Economic Report while the corresponding figure for nonfinancial cor-

porations

is reported in Table B—il. The Department of Commerce follows the

same procedure, based on the NFC's share of federal profits, for allocating

property or agricultural land'; this implies that nonfinancial corporations bear
more than a proportionate share of the total property tax. The variation in
effective tax rates among jurisdictions could

either strengthen this tendency or

reverse it. Because of this uncertainty, we present three separate

calculations. The first assigns property taxes in the same ratio as the value
of the property; if the variation in tax rates among jurisdictions is uncorre—
lated with the mix of property

types, this "equal tax assignment is a conser-

vative understatement of the property tax paid by non—financial corporations.

The second method assumes that the effective tax rate on nonfinancial corporate
property is three times the effective tax rate

on other property.2 The third

method assumes the opposite imbalance: the effective tax rate on other property
is three times the rate on the property on non—financial corporations. (The
second and third calculations are almost certain to bound the true value.) For
1919, these two assumptions imply that nonfinancial corporations may

as 56.7 percent of the total state and local

pay

as much

property tax or as little as 12.7

percent.

Column 4 of Table 1 reports the total state and
local property tax

collections while columns 5, 6, and 7 report the property taxes assigned to
nonfinancial corporations by the three assumptions. Note that the basic
assuinp—
tion of method 1 (i.e., the assumption that nonfinancial corporations
pay the
same effective tax rate as other property owners)

implies that NFCs paid $19.6

billion in property taxes during 1979.

The effective tax rate has two
components: the assessment—price ratio and the
tax rate on assessed value. The 1977 Census of Governments Taxable Property
Values and Assessment—Sales Price Ratios
reports the assessment price ratio on
commercial and industrial property to be higher than that on any other class of
property. Netzer's (1973) comments indicate that the equal effective tax rate
assumption probably understates the taxation of business
property.
2 This
implies that, for 1979, nonfinancial corporations paid 56. ercent of
the property tax even though they 'only had 30.4 percent of taxable property.

For the 32 year period from 1948 through 1979, the total pretax rate
of return (column 4) averages
11.5 percent. By contrast, the conventional

return based on capital income after state and local property tax payments is

only 10.3 percent. The failure to add state and local property taxes back into
the total return to capital caused previous estimates to understate the rate of
return by about 1.2 percentage points or nearly 11 percent. The estimates for
overlapping decades (also shown in Table 2) indicate that this difference has
remained fairly constant over the post—war period with some tendency for a
larger gap in the second half of the period than in the first half.

1 The capital stock is measured net of depreciation in
contrast to a gross capital stock from which scrapping is deducted. All of the estimates in the present paper are therefore comparable to the "net" profitability series in
Feldstejn and Summers (1977) and not to the "gross" profitability series.
2 These

figures differ from the rN series in Feldstein and Summers (1977)
because of data revisions. tta revisions affect the earlier years in the
series because of the new estimates of the values of land and inventories.

alternative estimates of the net rates of return based on
the two extreme assumptions about the property tax rate on nonfinancial corporations and other types of property. The assumption that the non—financial
corporations pay a property tax rate equal to three times the rate paid on other
property yields the series shown in column 5 and implies that the conventional

estimate of the rate of return understates the true value by about 2.2
percentage points. Conversely, the extreme assumption of 'undertaxation' of nonfinancial corporate property implies that the conventional estimate understates
the

true rate of return by about 0.5

percentage points (column 6). It seems safe to

conclude that the truth lies somewhere

between these extremes and that the con-

ventional estimate of the rate of return

has been too low by between one and two

percentage points, implying that the true value exceeds the conventional estimate by between 10 and 20 percent.

Effective Tax Rates

The effective tax rate on the capital income of nonfinancial corporations depends on the federal, state and local taxes that are paid by the
corporation

itself and by the corporation's shareholders and creditors. These

include the corporate income

taxes, the property tax, the personal tax on divi-

dends and capital gains, and the personal and corporate taxes on the interest
income received by the creditors of the nonfinancial corporations.
In an earlier paper, Feldstein and

Summers (1979) calculated the

of nonfinancial corporations. In

contrast to previous studies that were limited to the corporate rate, the

Fe1dsteinSuers analysis also included the federal taxes on dividends,

the effective tax rate as the ratio of the
combined tax liability to the real pretax capital income. The present study

The effective tax rate on dividends depends on the distribution of

dividends among different classes of investors

(households, pension funds, life

insurance companies, etc.) and the average effective tax rate for each class of

investor. The present study uses the Flow of Funds data on equity ownership to
distribute dividends among classes of investors for each year since 1953.1
Brinner and Brooks (1979) have calculated the tax rate on dividends received by

individuals, inc1udin the state and local taxes; this rate averaged 143.2 percent for the years 1953 through 1979 and was 149 percent for 1979.2 Individuals
account for approximately 93 percent of the equity that the Flow of Funds sector statements of assets and liabilities

1 This assignment assumes that equity in nonfinancial
corporations is distributed in the same way as total

equity and that dividends are distributed in
proportion to total equity. This represents an improvement over Feldstein
and Summers (1979) where the 1976 pattern of ownership was used to assign
dividends in all years of the period.

2 To compute the federal tax on dividends, Brinner and
Brooks constructed a

weighted average of individual taxrates, using the fraction of dividends
received by each taxable income class each year and the corresponding statutory marginal rates. State dividend taxes
are estimated by assuming that the
marginal rate on dividends is 1.5 times the average state personal tax rate,
which can be computed from NIPA aggregates. Columns 3 and 4
of Appendix
table A—i provide the separate series for the federal and state taxes, which
were kindly provided by Br inner and Brooks.

3 The 93 percent refers to 1975 and is based on a calculation

capital gains was raised in a number of ways: the use of the alternative tax was
limited, the value of the loss offset was reduced, the "untaxedt' portion of

capital gains was subject to a minimum tax, and the amount of income qualifying

for the maximum tax on personal services income was reduced. There is no way to
provide an accurate evaluation of the weighted average capital gains tax rate
for each year in our series. In stead, we shall make what we regard as the quite
conservative assumption that households paid an effective rate of tax of only 5
percent on accruing capital gains except during the years 1969 through 1918 when

the rate was 7.5 percent. Insurance companies and banks are taxed at a 30 percent statutory rate on capital gains realizations. We assume an effective rate
of 15 percent on accruing gains because of the effect of deferral. Finally, we
assume that pensions, foreign shareholders, and other "miscellaneous" investors

pay no tax on capital gains. The overall effective tax rate on capital gains
implied by these values was .0L in 1919 and .062 in 1918 (before the tax
change) •1

The capital gains tax rate must be applied to two kinds of capital
gains: the rise in the real value that results from retained earnings and the
rise in the nominal value that results from the general increase in the price

level. The national income account estimate of retained earnings is deficient
because it ignores the real gain that the equity owners make at the expense of

the creditors. For example at the beginning of 1979 the net debt of nonfinan-

cial corporations2 was $138.2 billion. The 9.9 percent rise in the personal

on taxes which were actually paid, the capital gains tax rate is an estimate
of the present value of the future tax liability which will be due when the
gains are realized.

consumption expenditure deflator implied a gain to the equity owners of $13.1

and

an equal loss to the creditors.1 The gain on outstanding debt must be added

to real retained earnings2 for each year to

calculate the real increase in

equity value.3 Multiplying this real increase in equity values by the capital
gains tax rate and dividing the product by adjusted real capital inconie gives

the additional tax component shown in column 6 of Table 3. This source of tax
is responsible for only between one percentage point and four percentage points
of the total effective tax rate.

results from the nominal

that accompanies a general rise in the

price level. We abstract from the year—to—year stock market fluctuations and
calculate the nominal rise in the value of the capital stock as the product of
the capital stock at the beginning of the year and the rise in the G1P deflator

1 Of course, the equity owners "paid for" some of this gain in the form of
higher interest rates and,•to that extent, national income account profits
are lower. The issue here is clarifying the real allocation of the income
between debt and equity and identifying the way in which this extra component
of real income is taxed.
2 The real retained earnings are, of course, after the inventory valuation
capital consumption allowance adjustments.

and

3 This real increase in equity value is presented in column 1 of Appendix table
A—i. We assume that an extra dollar of real retained earnings raises the
market value of equities by one dollar. This abstracts from year—to—year
fluctuations in stock market valuation. It also ignores the arguments of
Auerbach (1918), Bradford (1919) and King (1911) that the capitalization of
of retained earnings to raise share

during the year.1 Multiplying this nominal increase in equity values by the
capital gains tax rate and dividing the product by the adjusted real capital

income gives the additional tax component shown in column 7 of Table 3. This
source of tax was responsible for less than 1.5 percentage points of effective
tax rate until the late l960's but the rise in inflation since then has made
this a more significant factor.

In the five years ending in 1979, the accrued

capital gains tax on this nominal increase was equivalent to an average tax on

total income of

percent.

The final component of the total effective tax rate is the tax borne

by the creditors of the nonfinancial corporations. Although there are federal,
state, and in some cases, local taxes on interest income, we follow the very

conservative procedure of including only the federal tax.2 Feldstein and
Summers (1979) used the Flow—of Funds accounts for 1976 to estimate the distribution of the net liabilities of nonfinancial corporations among households,
pensions, commercial banks, savings banks, life insurance companies, government

accounts, and a number of smaller categories. We use the relative weights
implied by this analysis and also follow Feldstein—Summers in setting the household tax rate on this interest income at 35 percent, the mutual savings bank
The GNP deflator is too broad an index while the fixed nonresidential investment deflator is too narrow (because it excludes inventories and land);
however both indices rose almost exactly the same amount over the 17 year
period and behaved quite similarly from year to year. Note that the equity
owners receive the nominal gain on the entire capital stock and not just on
the equity fraction. The value of the beginning—of—year capital stock for

each year, found in the "Balance Sheets" document, is presented in column 8

of Appendix table A—l. The calculation abstracts from the depressing effect
on share prices of unanticipated changes in inflation; see Feldstein (1980)
and the other research cited therein.

taxes on interest income, especially the taxes paid by financial corporations.

providers of capital if
pretax

the

return to capital is the marginal return
capItal and if the effective tax rate is an effective marginal rate. As to
we have already noted, the
pretax return to capital may differ from the marginal return if these are non—
constant returns to scale, economic rents
or monopoly profits. The effective
tax rate may differ from the marginal effective tax rate if the marginal allocation of saving is different from the
average saving pattern. In particular,
the marginal tax rate will exceed the
average rate if individuals are limited
in the amount of low tax rate
saving that they can do by such things as the
limits on pensions and Keogh contributions.

3 These

alternative assumptions require changes in both the numerator, for taxes
paid, and the denominator, for pre—tax income, of the effective tax rate ratios.

Conversely, if nonfinancial corporations

The last column of Table

and reports the effective federal tax rate defined as the ratio of the total

federal tax to the real capital income net of the state and local taxes paid by

the corporations.2 This effective federal rate shows the same general movement

Is

the Rate of Profit Falling?

The

average value of the pretax rate of return was 9.8 percent

in the

1970's and thus substantially lower than the corresponding averages of 12.7
for the 1960's and 11.1 for the period from 1953 to 1959. Does the lower
rate of return in recent years reflect a fundamental fall

in the rate of profit

or has it just been a cyclical or temporary change?
In a previous paper, Feldstein and Summers (1977) attempted to answer
that question with data for a period ending in 1976. That study concluded
that
there was no statistical support

for

the view that there had been a gradual

decline in the rate of return over the postwar period but found that the average
return between 1970 and 1976 was some 1 to 2 percent lower than would have been

The results are very similar to the previous estimate. There is no
evidence of a general time trend but an indication that the rate of return was
some two percentage points lower in the l970's than in the previous two decades.

A higher rate of capacity utilization

tends on average to raise the rate of

return, each additional percentage point raising the rate of return by about

one—sixth of a percentage point. Replacing

the capacity utilization variable

with the GNP—gap yields very similar results.
Although capacity utilization (or the GNP—gap) is intended as an indication of the economy's cyclical

condition, it actual]y describes only one

aspect of that cyclical condition. Figure 1 presents a business cycle diagram
with the amplitude measured in terms of capacity utilization. The use in

equation .l of capacity utilization as a measure of the economy's cyclical condition is equivalent to treating points A and B as equivalent even though A

The coefficient of the RECOVERY variable show that the rate of
return tends to
be about two percentage points higher during the first year of the recovery than
it would otherwise be with the same level of capacity utilization. The coefficient of the QTILPK variable shows that the rate of return is higher during
expansion than during contractions (when QTILPK = 0) but that this excess fades
as the econonr gets closer to the peak; each quarter further away from the peak
adds about one tenth of a percentage point.

Capacity utilization continues to be

an important variable; indeed, its coefficient is twice as large in 4.2 as it
was in 4.i when the other cycle variables were not taken into account. The
coefficients of the time trend variable and the dummy variable for the l970's
are also similar to those of equation 4.i, indicating no time trend but a
reduction of about 1.5 percentage points in the l970's.

The coefficients of equation 4.2 show that the explicit business
cycle variables provide information about the fluctuations in profitability
that are not captured in simpler measures of aggregate demand like capacity

utilization and the GNP cap. As a further test of the usefulness of measuring
activity relative to the business cycle peaks and troughs, we added a four year

distributed lag in the capacity utilization variable. The explicit business
cycle variables are still very significant; the coefficients are more than three

the

change in profitability between the 1970's and the earlier years of the

is interesting to note that all three measures of profitability
have changed in the same direction and that the effective tax rate moved in the
opposite direction. The total effective tax rate averaged 69.6 percent in the

The coefficient'of the productivity growth variable (PRODGRO) implies that each
additional percentage point of productivity growth has associated with it a 0.3
percentage point increase in profitability.

The lower rate of productivity growth in the 1970's contributed significantly to the decline in profitability but zas not responsible for the change

in the composite trend variable. The coefficients of equation 5.1 imply composite trend values of 0.52 for the 1970's, 1.85 for the 1960's and 1.50 for the

entire sample period before 1970. The gap between the profitability of the
1960's and the 1970's is narrowed to 1.32 percentage points while the difference

between the 1970's and all the preceding years is 0.98 percentage points. The
fall in productivity growth from an average of 2.5 in the 1960's to 1.4 in the
1970's decreased profitability by .32 percentage points or about 24 percent of
the overall profitability decline.

A higher inflation rate can reduce pretax profitability in a variety

of ways. For example, firms may seek greater after—tax profits by investing in
inventories and other assets with more favorable tax treatment. Alternatively,
firms may be misled into making low—profit investments or inappropriate pricing
decisions by accounting calculations that do not correctly adjust for inflation.

is large and statistically significant (—3.98 with a standard error of 1.21).

For the 1970's as a whole, the average value of this nominal to real profits

ratio was .99 while for the 1960's it was 1.25. The increase in the ratio thus
implies a fall in pretax profitability.

Including this accounting ratio variable reduces the size and sta-

tistical significance of the time variables. In this specification, the composite trend var±able is .03 for the 1970's and .77 for the 1960's, implying a

fall of only .71 percentage points. Similarly, between the 1970's and the

pre—1970 sample period, the difference is only .59 percentage

points. If

this is a correct estimate of the effect of the accounting error, it can be
assumed to be only a temporary

influence until firms see through the accounting

convention and assess costs and profits more accurately.

Adding the productivity growth variable reduces the coefficient of the

accounting ratio to —2.13 and raises its standard error to 1.60. In this more
general specification, the accounting ratio can at most be considered marginally

significant. Moreover, the composite time trend implies a more substantial
decline of 1.10 percentage points between the 1960's and 1970's. The inference

An alternative relative price variable,

the ratio of final sales

ratio was 20.2 with a standard error of 8.214. The relative price index rose
from an average of .77 in the 1960's to .814 in the 1970's, implying a fall of

—31—

In summary then, we have identified several variables that have

influenced profitability during the past decades, Of these variables, only the

rate of productivity growth, the rate of general inflation, and the ratio of
accounting profits to real profits helped to explain some of the trend decline
in pretax profitability. Adding the productivity, growth variable to any specification leaves the other new variable statistically insignificant. The implication of this work, therefore, is that although several factors contributing to
the profitability decline have been identified, a decline in cyclically—adjusted
profitability of between one and 1.5 percentage points from the 1960's to the
1970's remains to be explained.

It should again be noted in conclusion that the fall in cyclically
adjusted pretax profitability between the 1960's and 1970's occurred at the same

time

as a rise in the effective tax rate. Similarly, the rise in cyclically

adjusted pretax profitability between the post—Korean war years of the 1950's

and the decade of the 1960's occurred at the same time as a fall in the effec-

tive tax rate. There was no tendency for pretax profits to move in a way that
offset changes in the effective tax rate.

Conclusion
This paper has presented new estimates of the taxes paid on nonfinan-

cial corporate capital, on the pretax rate of return to capital, and on the

effective tax rate. The basic time series show that both the pretax rate of
return and the effective tax rate have varied substantially in the past quarter
century.

An explicit analysis indicates that, after adjusting for different
aspects of the business cycle, pretax profitability was between one and 1.5 per—

—38—

centage points lower in the 1970's than in the 1960's. The rate of profitability in the 1960's was also about one—half of a percentge point greater than the

profitability in the 7 years of the 1950's after the Korean war.
Changes in productivity growth, in inflation,

in relative unit labor

costs, and in other variables are all associated with chances in profitability.
None of these variables, however, can explain the differences in profitability
between the 1950's, 1960's and 1970's.

Looking at broad decade averages, the effective tax rate and the pretax rate of return move in opposite directions, higher pretax profits occurring

when the tax rate is high. There thus appears to have been no tendency for pretax profits to vary in a way that offsets differences
