    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper develops asymptotic econometric theory to help understand data generated by a present value model with a discount factor near one.  A leading application is to exchange rate models.  A key assumption of the asymptotic theory is that the discount factor approaches 1 as the sample size grows.  The finite sample approximation implied by the asymptotic theory is quantitatively congruent with modest departures from random walk behavior with imprecise estimation of a well-studied regression relating spot and forward exchange rates.\n\n",
