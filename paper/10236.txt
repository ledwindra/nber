Financial Development and Growth in the Short and Long Run

ABSTRACT
We analyze the relationship between financial development and inter-industry resource allocation
in the short- and long-run. We suggest that in the long-run, economies with high rates of financial
development will devote relatively more resources to industries with a 'natural' reliance on outside
finance due to a comparative advantage in these industries. By contrast, in the short-run we argue
that financial development facilitates the reallocation of resources to industries with good growth
opportunities, regardless of their reliance on outside finance. To test these predictions, we use a
measure of industry-level 'technological' financial dependence based on the earlier work of Rajan
and Zingales (1998), and develop new proxies for shocks to (short run) industry growth
opportunities. We find differential effects of these measures on industry growth and composition
in countries with different levels of financial development. We obtain results that are consistent with
financially developed economies specializing in 'financially dependent' industries in the long-run,
and allocating resources to industries with high growth opportunities in the short-run.

Economists have long been interested in the role of financial development in resource
allocation. The hypothesis that financial development facilitates the efficient allocation of
resources dates back to at least Schumpeter (1912), who conjectured that banks identify
entrepreneurs with good growth prospects, and therefore help to reallocate resources to their
most productive uses. More recently, Levine (1997) describes a number of channels through
which financial development may affect allocative efficiency, including information generation,
risk-sharing, financing, and monitoring. Rajan and Zingales (1998) point out that allocation may
be differentially affected by industry characteristics: those that require a lot of upfront outside
financing (relative to generated cash flow), such as drugs and pharmaceuticals (perhaps due to
R&D costs), will be less likely to grow in the presence of capital market imperfections than other
industries where investment more closely coincides with cash generation. More recently, a
number of other researchers have used a similar approach to look at the interaction of various
‘fixed’ industry characteristics and different aspects of financial development in predicting
sectoral growth.
In this paper, we suggest that there is an important theoretical distinction in considering
the role of financial development on industry growth in the short- and long-run that has
heretofore gone largely unrecognized. In the short-run, we emphasize the role of financial
institutions in reallocating resources to any industry that has experienced a positive shock to
growth opportunities. We contrast this with a long-run view of the allocative effects of financial
development, suggested by Rajan and Zingales (RZ), who argued that certain industries will
naturally be more reliant on financial institutions to finance growth. Intuitively, this leads to
separate predictions on the allocative effects of financial development in the short- and long-run.
In the short-run, sectoral growth will be more correlated with growth opportunities in countries

with well-developed financial institutions that allow firms to take advantage of these
opportunities. In other words, in an economy with high financial development, actual industry
growth in the short-run will be a function of growth opportunities (i.e. potential), regardless of
inherent industry characteristics. In the long-run, financially dependent industries will have
comparative advantage in countries with well-developed financial institutions and will thus
capture a larger share of total production (relative to an economy with a low level of financial
development), i.e., countries with high financial development will specialize in financially
dependent industries. Thus, sector share of financially dependent industries will be higher in
countries with high financial development.
In order to examine these contrasting predictions empirically, we require proxies for
short-run shocks, as well as inherent industry reliance on financial intermediation. We develop
measures of short-run shocks based on the assumption that there exist global shocks to growth
opportunities that may be proxied for by actual growth in the United States. One interpretation of
this measure is that it is a reflection of U.S. companies’ optimal responses to worldwide shocks
(such as oil shocks). Based on the assumption that if the U.S. has very well developed financial
markets (as suggested by RZ), global shocks will be quickly reflected in actual growth rates in
the United States. Under this assumption, actual industry growth in the US may be used as a
proxy for growth opportunities for the same industry in other countries. Alternatively, we may
think of these shocks as originating in the United States (due to demand and/or productivity
shocks within the U.S.) and propagated to other countries with economic links with the United
States.

This interpretation allows for a further refinement of our measure of growth

opportunities: We allow actual growth in the United States to differentially affect industries in
different countries, based on their trade linkages to the United States. To implement this, we

1

weight U.S. growth by the extent of trade with the United States for each industry in each
country. Thus, our assumption of U.S.-based shocks allows us to generate a country-industry
specific proxy for growth opportunities. This is in contrast to earlier work in this literature,
which has always taken U.S.-based measures to apply uniformly around the world.
Our measure of underlying financial dependence builds on the earlier work of Rajan and
Zingales (1998), which measures financial dependence as the mismatch between cashflow and
investment, calculated using data on U.S. publicly traded firms. The rationale for this approach is
that there are exist time-invariant, i.e. ‘inherent’ industry characteristics, which make some
industries more (or less) reliant on external financing, and that this dependence will be reflected
in U.S. firms, due to the efficiency of U.S. capital markets. Financially dependent industries will
be at a comparative advantage in countries with well- developed financial markets that allow
firms to take advantage of opportunities in industries with such characteristics, and will thus
garner a larger share of production (which represents long-run accumulated growth rates) in
these countries. This stands in contrast to the idea of shocks to growth opportunities that is based
on temporary, i.e. time-specific, shocks which will be reflected in short-run growth.
Our results are broadly consistent with the arguments laid out above: industry sectoral
growth is more correlated with our measures of industry shocks in countries with well-developed
financial markets; industry sectoral shares are more correlated with financial dependence in
countries with high financial development. Further, we find similar patterns for alternative
measures of financial dependence, including R&D intensity (Beck and Levine, 2002) and trade
credit dependency (Fisman and Love, 2003).
Our results highlight the important distinction between the roles of financial development
in resource allocation in the short- and long-run, and also provide some guidance and structure

2

for future work in this area.

In particular, we introduce a broader measure of ‘growth

opportunities’ that we claim is more suited to studying allocation through sectoral growth, while
intrinsic industry characteristics (such as financial dependence) should be more useful in
predicting allocation of sector shares. Further, our paper suggests a reinterpretation and a
potential augmentation to a number of earlier works that follow the methodology of Rajan and
Zingales (1998). To cite just a few examples, Claessens and Laeven (2003) examine industryspecific tangibility of assets and its relationship to property rights protection; Fisman and Love
(2003) study industry-specific trade credit affinity; and Cetorelli and Gambera (2003) analyze on
the relationship between different aspects of financial development, ‘external dependence,’ and
sectoral growth.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 1 gives a brief overview of the
various mechanisms through which financial institutions may facilitate efficient resource
allocation; Section 2 describes our empirical approach; our data are described in Section 3; In
Section 4, we report our results; and in Section 5, we conclude.

1. Theories of Financial Development and Resource Allocation
While financial development may affect the level of economic growth through numerous
channels, we focus here on the role of financial institutions in allocating resources to firms or
industries with good growth opportunities. Even within this limited realm, there exists a vast
body of work; we provide only a brief and limited overview to highlight the fact that there exist
several functions of financial intermediaries that could have implications for both short- and
long-run sectoral growth.1

1

These include the provision of external financing; information

See Levine (1997) for an overview with greater breadth and depth.

3

acquisition and dispersion; governance and oversight; and risk diversification.

We briefly

discuss each of these in turn, emphasizing the role of financial institutions in both the short- and
long-run.

Provision of External Finance – As described by Schumpeter (1912), financial institutions
provide funding to entrepreneurs with good growth prospects. Any industry with high growth
opportunities will require a relatively large amount of outside financing, since future cash flow
(and current investment) will be high relative to current cash flow. Since financial institutions
allow firms (and hence industries) that have good growth opportunities to better finance current
investment, industries with good growth opportunities should grow relatively more in countries
with high financial development. In addition, as suggested by Rajan and Zingales (1998), there
may be certain industries where there is a ‘natural’ lag between investment opportunities and
cash flow. Industries with this inherent need for external finance (i.e. financially dependent
industries) will be relatively advantaged in responding to growth opportunities at all times in
countries with well-developed financial institutions, i.e., these countries will have a comparative
advantage in finance-dependent sectors. These incremental relative advantages will accumulate
over time. Hence, we anticipate that a relatively large share of output in high financial
development economies will be in high external finance industries.
We further note that conversely, some industries may be naturally better suited to obtain
external financing from sources other than formal financial intermediaries. One example is
suggested by Fisman and Love (2003), which examines trade credit access and intersectoral
allocation. Following their theoretical discussion, we suggest here that industries with ready
trade credit access should be less reliant on formal financial institutions to finance growth

4

opportunities, and should therefore be relatively well-represented in countries with low financial
development.

Information Acquisition and Dispersion – In addition to the financing role described above, King
and Levine (1993) emphasize the role of financial institutions in overcoming informational
problems that are likely to loom large in areas with new and emerging opportunities. Through
price signals and specialized resources devoted to evaluating firms’ prospects, well-functioning
financial institutions may both directly devote resources to promising ventures, and also signal
high potential sectors to the broader economy. In addition to facilitating growth in any new and
uncertain sector, therefore, this reasoning suggests that industries in which information is
inherently difficult to acquire (such as high R&D sectors, which we consider below) will obtain a
relatively large share of output in high financial development economies.

Risk and Uncertainty – In addition to limited information, the financing of new opportunities is
likely to be accompanied by risk. In the model of De la Fuente and Marin (1996), for example,
this leads entrepreneurs to devote resources to safer but lower growth projects. This implies a
weaker response to growth opportunities, and suggests that industries that are generally risky
(once again, we will suggest high R&D sectors have this attribute) will be a relatively large share
of production in high financial development economies.

Monitoring – The model of Blackburn and Hung (1998) focuses on the monitoring role of
financial institutions in promoting growth.

Closely related to their model is the idea that

financial intermediaries may ‘create winners’ in addition to ‘picking winners.’ That is, in

5

addition to choosing to finance projects that are expected to grow through the provision of funds,
financial institutions may ensure that the firms that receive funding use their resources to best
take advantage of growth opportunities. Furthermore, it is plausible that high R&D industries (or
intangible-intensive industries generally) are more likely to be subject to concerns of moral
hazard.

2. Empirical Approach

2.1. Industry Growth and Growth Opportunities

In order to assess the responsiveness of resource allocation to growth opportunities, we first
require a proxy for these opportunities. Our first identifying assumption is based on the premise
that there exist global industry-specific shocks to growth opportunities i.e., some component of
growth opportunities is common across countries.
These global shocks could arise as a consequence of technological innovations (for example,
the invention of semiconductors or cellular phones) or global shifts in factor prices (for example
oil shocks). Following the assertion of Rajan and Zingales (1998), we argue that because of its
well-developed financial market institutions, the United States will be well-positioned to take
advantage of these opportunities, so that GO*ict = USGrowthit + εict, where GO*ict are the
(unobserved) growth opportunities in industry-country ic at time t. That is, growth opportunities
include both global and idiosyncratic components, with actual USGrowth acting as our proxy for
worldwide shocks to growth opportunities. Our test of whether financial development facilitates
efficient responses to these shocks at time t is then:

6

(1) Growthict = αi + αc + FDc*USGrowthit + εic

Next, we extend this model by allowing a proxy for growth opportunities to reflect the idea that
in addition to global shocks, there will be a U.S.-specific component (as described in the
introduction) that will be transmitted to countries with close trade ties to the United States. More
precisely, we define:

(2) USShockict = USTradeict*USGrowthit

Where USTradeit is the share of trade (imports + exports) between the United States and country
c as a fraction of total output in industry i at time t. USShockit thus allows for the possibility that
growth shocks may originate in the United States (because of its large size), and be transmitted
to countries that have relatively significant trade ties to the United States.

Although this

approach is still reliant on US-based measures, it is a step forward in allowing for the generation
of country-industry specific proxies for growth opportunities.2

2.2. Industry Share and ‘inherent’ needs for finance

In contrast to the short-run relation between growth opportunities and financial development
discussed above, we expect that underlying industry characteristics, such as inherent need for
finance, will interact with financial development to affect sector shares, since sector shares are a
result of accumulated past growth rates. That is, economies with well-developed financial
2

Fisman and Love (2004) provide an alternative assumption for country-specific proxies for growth opportunities.

7

institutions will specialize in industries that have an inherent reliance on outside financing.
Following the suggestion of RZ, we assert that some firms are dependent on financial institutions
because of an inherent mismatch between cash flows and investment, due to underlying
technological characteristics. We use the measure of external financial dependence constructed
by RZ, which we call USNeedsi and conjecture that:

(3) Shareic = αi + αc + β1FDc*USNeedsi + εic

where Shareic is a share of industry i in total manufacturing output of country c. The hypothesis
that β1>0 implies that industries where expenses cannot be matched to cash flows will be more
prevalent in countries with high financial development because they will have a comparative
advantage in these industries.
Note that there are complications in considering the effects of RZ’s variable, USNeeds
(as a measure of inherent financial dependence) on industry share and growth. This measure is
constructed as the difference between investment expenditures and current cash flow. Therefore,
it will simultaneously pick up the effects of growth opportunities that result in high current
investment (GO), as well as the differences across industries in the extent to which expenditures
to take advantage of these opportunities cannot be matched to generated cash flows
(Dependence).3 Hence,

(4) Needsit = f(GOit,Dependencei)

3

This alludes to the broader issue of constructing measures of underlying inherent industry characteristics using data
from a particular time period. We discuss this concern further in the data section below.

8

The nature of f(.) will depend on underlying technologies, so we do not attempt to assign a
functional form to this relationship. We simply make the observation that USNeeds will be
correlated with our proxy for global growth opportunities, USGrowth, but will also reflect the
differential ability of industries to rely on external finance due to the technological differences –
i.e. financial dependence. Thus, in our model, the interaction USNeeds*FD will be significant in
predicting Growthict, if the analysis is done without controlling more directly for growth
opportunities. This is the regression reported by Rajan and Zingales (1998). In other words,
USGrowth is a purer reflection of growth opportunities, while USNeeds is a reflection of
industry financing needs, which incorporates simultaneously elements of growth opportunities,
financial dependence, and the form of f(.) in (4) above. Thus, while USNeeds may be used as a
time-varying predictor of financing industry needs, we suggest that our USGrowth measure is a
more direct proxy for growth opportunities, as in (1) above.4 Hence, we suggest that when we
include the USGrowth*FD interaction in addition to USNeeds*FD, this more direct measure of
growth opportunities will dominate in the growth regression. This will not be the case in sectoral
share regressions, where we expect the underlying industry characteristic of financial
dependence to be the dominant explanatory factor. The main difference in our two approaches is
the following: we argue that inherent needs for funds affect industry shares while RZ argued that
they affect industry growth. In our model, growth is primary affected by temporary shocks to
growth opportunities; the effect of underlying industry characteristics on sectoral growth is thirdorder.

4

Our discussion on sector shares suggests that the interactive effect of growth opportunities and financial
development on sectoral growth should be stronger in financially dependent industries. This is a third-order effect
(i.e., a triple interaction). When we looked at the triple interactions of FD*USGrowth*Dependence, the coefficients
were of the predicted signs, but were not generally significant.

9

In summary, our approach provides sharply contrasting hypotheses regarding the
importance of USGrowth and USNeeds in predicting industry growth versus predicting industry
shares: USGrowth, as a proxy for growth opportunities, will dominate US Needs in predicting
sectoral growth across countries, while USNeeds, as a proxy for external finance dependence,
will dominate USGrowth in predicting sector shares.
Our claim regarding the relationship between underlying industry characteristics and
sectoral allocation is a more general one, and will be applicable to any underlying feature of an
industry that leads to greater (or lesser) reliance on (formal) financial markets. We therefore
include two additional ‘robustness’ tests based on earlier work on financial markets and
intersectoral allocation. First, we draw on the work of Beck and Levine (2002) who claim that
R&D intensity may also lead to a relatively high reliance on financial intermediaries. We predict
a similar effect of R&D intensity on sector shares as with USNeeds: R&D intensive industries
will be relatively well-represented in high financial development economies. Also, we examine
the effect of trade credit availability, as suggested by Fisman and Love (2003), who argue that
firms in industries with easy access to trade credit (i.e., high payables) will be able to finance
growth with less need to access formal financial markets. Therefore, we predict an opposite
effect: industries with higher ‘trade credit afinity’ will be relatively well-represented in countries
with low financial development. Thus, we also run regressions of the form:

(5) Shareic = αi + αc + β3*FDc*USR&Di + εic, where β3 > 0
(6) Shareic = αi + αc + β4*FDc*USAPAYi + εic, where β4 <0

10

Where, USR&Di and USAPAYi are industry-specific measures of R&D intensity and trade credit
affinity (measured by accounts payables over assets ratio) respectively.

3. Data
Our data are drawn primarily from Rajan and Zingales (1998), and described in detail in that
paper. For comparison with their work, the main outcome variable is real growth in valued
added, estimated for each of 37 industries in 42 countries over the period 1980-1990. The
original data source is Industrial Statistics Yearbook published by United Nations (1993). We
use the original measure of external financial dependence constructed by RZ, which we refer to
as USNeeds to highlight the fact that this measure captures the need for external finance and that
it is calculated using US data (obtained from the Compustat database). The original measure is
calculated as a ratio of investment minus cash flow divided by investment and captures the
percent of total investment that is financed by the external funds (see RZ for more details on
calculation of this measure).
To construct our first measure of growth opportunities, USGrowth, we calculate industrymedian of real sales growth between 1980 and 1990 using all firms from Compustat.5 This
industry-specific measure of growth opportunities assumes that there is some component of
growth opportunities that is common across all countries – i.e. a global shock. Our second
measure of growth opportunities, denoted by USShock, is USGrowth, adjusted for the trade
flows. First, we construct USTrade, which equals to the ratio of (exportscj + importscj)/(total
outputcj), where exports and imports measure trade of country c with the US in each industry j.
5

We first calculate the real average growth rate for each firm in the sample for the decade of 1980’s and then take
the industry-level median of the firm-level averages of growth rates. We excluded 1% of the top and bottom tails of
the distribution of firm-years of sales growth to eliminate cases of mergers, acquisitions, or disposals of assets. This
parallels the approach used by RZ in calculating their external financial dependence measure.

11

This measure captures the importance of trade with the US for each industry-country
combinations. We obtain export and import data for each country-industry from Compatible
Trade and Production Database, COMTAP, distributed by OECD and described in Harrigan
(1996). The advantage of this trade data is that it uses the same industry classification as in the
original RZ data (i.e. ISIC classification). We obtain total output data from the same Industrial
Statistics database published by UN that was used by RZ to construct original industry growth
measure. To reduce potential endogeneity, our trade measure is constructed for the year 1980 and
it captures the trade at the beginning of the decade for which the growth data are constructed.
Then, our second measure of country-industry specific growth opportunities, USShock,

is

constructed as a product of USGrowth*USTrade.
Two additional industry-level measures - R&D intensity, USR&D, and Trade Credit
Affinity, USAPAYTA - are constructed from Compustat for the same sample of firms and same
time-period as was used for original financial dependence measure. R&D intensity is measured
as industry median of a ratio of R&D expenses (summed over the decade) over the total sales
(again summed over the decade). USAPAYTA is measured as a ratio of accounts payable to total
assets. It captures the industry’s reliance on trade credit finance and is described in detail in
Fisman and Love (2003).
Finally, we utilize RZ’s primary measure of financial market development, given by the
sum of market capitalization and total domestic credit provided by banks to private borrowers,
referred to as “Total capitalization”.6 A complete list of the variables used in this paper with the

6

Note that we recognize the potential endogeneity of financial development. However, it is not clear that
appropriate instruments exist for this variable. When we use the set of instruments that are commonly used in this
literature, legal origin and settler mortality (see, for example, Beck et al, 2004), we obtain results that are statistically
significant at the ten percent level in both our share and growth regressions, and consistent with those reported
below. However, it is not clear that these variables satisfy the conditions required of instruments, so we do not
report those results in our tables. These results are all available from the authors.

12

original sources is given in Table 1; Table 2 Panel A shows the basic summary statistics for all
measures used in the paper and Panel B reports industry-level measures. We note that the
correlation of USgrowth and USNeeds is 0.65, (significant at 1%) which is in line with our
hypothesis that they are both related to growth opportunities. On the other side, the correlation of
USR&D and USNeeds is even higher, at 0.78, which is at least suggestive of the possibility that
they may both be capturing an industry-specific measure of financial dependence.
As a final observation, we note that we have generated both our time-varying measure of
growth shocks, as well as our industry characteristic variables that should not be susceptible to
the time period chosen. We will therefore follow RZ by generating our industry variables using
data from the 1970s as well, to make sure that our sector share results are not sensitive to choice
of decade for the generation of our time-invariant characteristics. We will also examine the
relationship between growth in the 1980’s and our measures of shocks, derived from 1970’s
Compustat data. Our ‘time invariant’ measure of financial dependence should still predict sector
shares, while our ‘non-event window’ growth data should not be predictive of 1980’s growth.
We therefore define the variables USNeeds70, USGrowth70, and USShock70 that are generated
precisely as described above, using data from 1970-80. It is interesting to note that the
correlation between USGrowth and USGrowth70 is 0.10, while the correlation between
USNeeds and USNeeds70 is 0.63. This lends some credence to the proposition that USNeeds
variable represents ‘structural’ characteristics, while USGrowth represents a temporal
characteristic.

4. Results
4.1. Financial Development and (Short-Run) Growth

13

We begin by examining the hypothesis that financial development helps to channel resources to
industries with good growth opportunities. These results, based on equation (1) above, are
reported in Table 3, column (1). We find that the coefficient on USGrowth*FD takes on the
value 1.07, and is significant at the 1 percent level. Its magnitude implies that an improvement
in financial development from 0.46 (Philippines, the 25th percentile) to 0.98 (Italy, the 75th
percentile) will result in an increased responsiveness to global growth shocks of 0.56. In column
(2), we replicate the results of Rajan and Zingales (1998), which shows that USNeeds*FD is a
significant predictor of growth in a regression where we have not directly controlled for growth
shocks. In column (3), we report results with both USNeeds*FD and USGrowth*FD as
regressors. Consistent with our hypothesis that USNeeds is a weaker proxy for global growth
prospects, we find that when both USNeeds and USGrowth are included in the same regression,
the USNeeds interaction is no longer significant.7 In columns (4) and (5) we use our measure
of industry-country specific growth opportunities, USShock. We find that the interaction term
USShock*FD is significant at a higher level than the USGrowth interactions reported in (1) and
(3). However, the coefficient on USShock*FD implies a considerably smaller effect of financial
development on resource allocation, since the standard deviation of USShock is about a tenth of
that of USGrowth, while its coefficient is only four times greater. This is consistent with
USShock picking up only a part of global shocks (relative to USGrowth), but measuring this
component of shocks more precisely. We note finally that USNeeds is again is not significant in
model (5) at conventional levels.

7

We examined the sensitivity of these results to outliers in growth rates first by dropping the top and bottom one
percent of observations of Growth and second by employing a robust regression approach. In both cases the
coefficient on USNeeds*FD was not significant, while USGrowth*FD remained significant at the one percent level.
These results are available from the authors.

14

We next consider the possibility that financial development may be proxying for other
country-level characteristics that create US-specific correlations in sectoral growth. First, we
consider the possibility that USGrowth may be a better proxy for growth opportunities in
wealthier economies. Since financial development is correlated with income, our interaction
term USGrowth*FD may be picking up this wealth effect. This was recognized by RZ, with
reference to the theory of Dornbush, Fisher and Samuelson (1977), which finds that as
technologies mature, industries involving those technologies migrate from developed to
developing countries. Therefore, in columns (5) – (6) of Table 3, we include the interactions
USGrowth*log(GDP per capita) and USShock* log(GDP per capita). The coefficients on our
two interaction, USGrowth*FD and USShock*FD, remain significant at the 1 percent level in
both regressions. Second, we allow for the possibility that the level of human capital
development may affect growth in industries that require highly skilled workers. If growth
shocks during the 1980’s were in such industries, then the interaction with of USGrowth (or
USShock) and financial development could be picking up human capital effects. We use a
commonly utilized measure of human capital, average years of schooling in 1980, and find that
in columns (8) and (9) our main results remain robust to adding these controls. As a final
specification check, in columns (10) and (11) we repeat our basic specification using Compustat
data from the 1970’s. In column (10), we find that the interaction USGrowth70*FD is
marginally significant (t=1.74). Note, however, that unlike our 1980’s interaction, this effect is
highly unstable, and may be an artifact of the moderate correlation of USGrowth and
USGrowth70: Removal of outliers, adding basic controls, or adding the USGrowth*FD
interaction, all cause this effect to evaporate. In column (11), we find that the interaction
USShock*FD is not significant.

15

4.2. Financial Development and Sector Share

We now examine the relationship between fixed industry characteristics and sector share. In
Table 4, column (1), we report results based on equation (2). Consistent with the hypothesis that
countries with well-developed financial institutions specialize in industries that require high rates
of external finance, the coefficient on USNeeds*FD is significant at the 1 percent level. Its
magnitude, 0.015, suggests an even larger allocative role for financial development than the
growth regressions described previously, since the standard deviation of Shareic is about 20
percent of that of Growthic. To ensure that this result is not simply the result of correlated
growth shocks, we include USGrowth*FD as a control in column (2). The coefficient on this
interaction term is not significant, and has very little effect on the coefficient on USNeeds*FD.
Thus, while our flow measure, USGrowth, has a significant impact on changes in allocations
(i.e., Growthic), it is not a significant predictor of shares in allocation (i.e., Shareic). As
additional controls, we include USNeeds*log(GDP per capita) and USNeeds* Human capital in
columns (4) and (5). The first is to account for the possibility that countries at similar levels of
economic development will specialize in similar sectors (see, for example, Chenery, 1960). The
second interaction allows for the possibility that industries with inherent needs for external funds
may also have high needs for skilled labor; since human capital development is correlated with
financial development (Table 2), our interaction could be picking up this effect. The original
interaction term USNeeds*FD remains significant in both cases. Finally, we use
USNeeds70*FD to examine the sensitivity of our results to the choice of time period; in contrast

16

to the growth results above, we find that USNeeds70 implies an even larger effect on sector
share than USNeeds, though we cannot reject the hypothesis that the effect is the same.
In columns (8) and (9), we show results for two alternative measures of financial
intermediary dependence: accounts payable intensity, and R&D intensity. Column (8) uses the
measure of reliance on trade credit finance proposed by Fisman and Love (2003). Consistent
with the hypothesis laid out in this earlier work, we find that industries that are able to rely more
on trade credit finance attain a larger share of production in countries with less-developed
financial markets, due to a comparative advantage in these industries. We obtain significance at
only the 7% level. Trade credit remains a significant predictor of sector shares when
USNeeds*FD and/or USAPAY*GDPPC are included as controls. Column (3) shows R&D
intensity as a final measure external finance dependence, as suggested in Section 1. The
coefficient on USR&D*FD is significant at one percent, and its size implies a similar effect as
that of USNeeds. Note, however, that this result is unstable: the inclusion of both USNeeds*FD
and USR&D*FD in the same regression causes the R&D interaction to lose significance. This
may be because the two variables are proxying for similar industry characteristics: To a large
degree our R&D may be picking up the fact that research and development requires upfront
investments, as suggested by the very high correlation between USNeeds and USR&D.

5. Conclusions
In this paper, we point out an important distinction between the long- and short-run
effects of financial market development. We emphasize that in the short-run, financial
development will facilitate the reallocation of resources to any industry with high growth
potential. Empirically, we find that actual growth is more highly correlated with our measure of

17

growth opportunities in economies with high financial development. One important spin-off of
our research is that in order to test this implication, we develop a plausible proxy for industrycountry growth shocks. In the long-run, we emphasize the implications of financial development
for the types of sectors that come to dominate economic activity: Countries with high financial
development specialize in industries with an inherent reliance on external finance. We believe
that this work will help to guide future work examining the role of financial development, and
allocative institutions more broadly defined, in the development process.

Table 1. Variable Definitions and Sources.

Abbreviation

Description

Industry-level variables (based on US data).
USNeeds

Dependence on external financing, industry-level median of the ratio of capital expenditures
minus cash flow over capital expenditures (the numerator and denominator are summed over
all years for each firm before dividing) for US. This variable measures the portion of capital
expenditures not financed by internally generated cash. From Rajan and Zingales (1998).

USGrowth

Growth in real sales, industry-level median of firm average growth rages over 1980-1990 for
US firms, from Compustat.

USAPAYTA

Industry-median of ratio of accounts payables over total assets calculated for all firms in
Compustat (from Fisman and Love (2003).

USR&D

Research and Development intensity, calculated as industry median of R&D to sales ratios
(both are summed over the decade of 1980 before taking a ratio) calculated for all firms in
Compustat.

Country-Industry level variables:
Industry growth

Annual compounded growth rate in real value added estimated for the period 1980-1990 for
each ISIC industry in each country from Rajan and Zingales (1998).

Fraction

Industry's share of total value added in manufacturing in 1980 from Rajan and Zingales
(1998).
Share of trade with the US as a fraction of total output in each industry and country in 1980
defined as (exports+Imports)/total output. Exports and Imports come from Compatible Trade
and Production Database, COMTAP, distributed by OECD and described in Harrigan (1996).
Total output comes from UNIDO – Industrial Statistics published by UN.

USTrade

USShock
Country-level variables:
FD

Defined as USGrowth*USTrade, a proxy for growth opportunities assuming a shock
originating in the US and transmitted to each industry-country via trade linkages.

Log GDP PC

Financial Development, equal to the sum of Domestic Credit and Market Capitalization to
GDP. Both are measured in 1980 and come from Rajan and Zingales (1998). Original source
is International Financial Statistics (IFS).
Log of GDP per capita in US dollars in 1980. IFS

Human

Human capital, equal to the average years of schooling from Rajan and Zingales (1998).
