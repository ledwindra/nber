    "abstract": "\n\nIn this paper, we survey non-competitive theories of training. With competitive labor markets, firms never pay for investments in general training, whereas when labor markets are imperfect, firm-sponsored training arises as an equilibrium phenomenon.  We discuss a variety of evidence which support the predictions of non-competitive theories, and we draw some tentative policy conclusions from these models.\n\n",
