Has the Unified Budget Undermined the Federal Government Trust Funds?
Sita Nataraj and John B. Shoven
NBER Working Paper No. 10953
December 2004
JEL No. H0
ABSTRACT
In order to ease the burden on workers during the retirement of the baby boom generation, the 1983
Social Security Reforms set payroll taxes above the level needed to pay current benefits, thus
partially prefunding the baby boomers' retirement. The military and civil service retirement programs
followed suit in the mid-1980s and switched from pay-as-you-go financing to funded systems. The
excess income generated by these retirement programs was held in the federal trust funds, which
have accumulated almost $3 trillion since the reforms took place. However, this paper presents
evidence that the trust fund build-up may not help future generations due to the adoption of the
Unified Budget in 1970. The Unified Budget includes trust fund receipts as income and trust fund
payments as expenditures. The empirical evidence suggests that attempts to balance the Unified
Budget while the trust funds were generating surpluses has led to increased government spending
and personal and corporation income tax cuts within the rest of the federal government. There is no
evidence of increased government saving as a result of the trust fund accumulations. An alternate
theory of increased national saving is also explored, where increased payroll taxes accompanied by
decreased income taxes induces higher personal saving. This mechanism, suggested by Diamond,
also does not appear to have significantly enhanced the wealth of future generations.

Has the Unified Budget Undermined the Federal Government Trust Funds?
by Sita Nataraj and John B. Shoven
I.

Introduction

The 1983 Social Security Reforms (sometimes referred to as the Greenspan Commission
reforms) were the most sweeping in the almost 70 year history of the system. They were
made under the threat of an almost immediate inability to pay full benefits to Social Security
recipients (Schieber and Shoven, 1999). One of the key elements of the 1983 reforms
involved setting the Social Security payroll tax rates above the level required to pay current
benefits. That is, the Greenspan Commission’s plan was for Social Security to depart from
pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) financing and to partially prefund the retirement costs of the baby
boom generation. The idea was to offer some relief to the workers in the 2015 to 2050 period
in supporting the enormous retired population forecast for that period. By forcing workers in
1984-2015 to pay higher payroll taxes than required to finance current retirement benefits, the
hope was that workers in the 2016-2050 era could pay lower than PAYGO taxes. The trust
fund buildup and subsequent spend down would spread the burden of the retirements of baby
boomers over 65 years rather than 30 years and somewhat even out the tax burden faced by
different generations of workers.
While Social Security represents the largest federal trust fund (the retirement and
disability programs combined were estimated to hold $1.63 trillion in assets at the end of
fiscal 2004), the federal government also maintains trust funds for Medicare, unemployment
insurance, civil service and military retirement, and transportation. The reform of Social
Security financing during the 1980s was accompanied by a move towards funding the military
and civil service retirement programs as well, again with the intent to relieve the tax burden

2

on future generations. Overall, the annual surplus across all trust funds increased, in constant
2000 dollars, from $16.6 billion in 1980 to $147.9 billion in 1990. Clearly, the 1980s were a
decade of change with respect to the operation of federal government trust funds. The biggest
ones went from PAYGO financing to full or partial funding. As a result of the sustained
surpluses of the trust funds, they accumulated almost $3 trillion in assets between 1985 and
2004.
Despite this success in building up the assets of the trust funds, it is not at all obvious
that the intended intergenerational burden sharing will take place. In order for the trust funds
to actually assist future generations of workers, they must increase national saving,
presumably by raising government saving. The only way to assist future workers is to leave
them more wealth. However, current federal budget policies treat the surplus of trust fund
revenues over expenditures, and the interest received by the trust funds, as part of the unified
surplus. The focus on balancing the unified surplus may serve as an invitation for the rest of
government (referred to as the federal funds) to offset the trust fund surplus through increased
government spending and the reduction in other taxes. Thus, the budget process may
undermine the attempt to raise government saving and build resources for future workers.
Alternatively, the increased payroll tax that accompanied the attempt to partially
prefund Social Security, and to fund the military and civil service retirement programs,
conceivably could increase national saving without increasing government saving. The
mechanism for this was suggested by Diamond (2003). If the higher than PAYGO-required
payroll tax permitted an offsetting reduction of the personal income tax (and perhaps the
corporation income tax); the composition of tax revenues was changed. If the marginal
propensity to save out of the payroll tax is low relative to the marginal propensity to save out

3

of personal income taxes, then private saving might increase as the country moved to the new
revenue mix. The idea is that the payroll tax is borne by relatively low income workers, at
least in comparison to those who bear the personal income tax, and that these lower income
workers have a marginal propensity to consume of approximately unity. The higher payroll
taxes might not depress saving, whereas the lower personal and corporate income taxes could
increase it.
This paper examines whether the shift from PAYGO to partially funded Social
Security (and the corresponding shift in the funding of military and civil service retirement
plans) resulted in a shift in national saving. We know that the attempt to partially prefund
Social Security benefits and to fund military and civil service pensions will tend to enlarge the
unified surplus numbers ceteris peribus. However, if the larger unified surplus projections
permit additional government spending and tax reductions, the saving by the trust funds may
be partially or even completely offset by reductions in federal funds saving. We also explore
whether larger trust fund surpluses resulted in increased personal saving through the channel
suggested by Diamond (2003).
Elmendorf and Liebman (2001), Smetters (2003), Burtless and Bosworth (2004), and
Shoven (2003) examine related questions. Our methodology is most closely related to that of
Smetters, who empirically demonstrates that increases in the off-budget (Social Security)
surplus tends to be associated with reductions in the on-budget (non-Social Security) surplus.
However, the Smetters study focuses only on Social Security surpluses: the surpluses of the
other trust funds are included in the on-budget surplus. Burtless and Bosworth (2004) extend
Smetters’ analysis to other developed countries, as well as to state governments. We extend
the analysis by examining the impact of increases in the aggregate surplus of all federal trust

4

funds on saving by the rest of the government (the federal funds). We believe this is the
appropriate way to address the question of whether the government’s attempts to save via the
trust funds have been successful. Since the assets in several trust funds were increased
simultaneously during the 1980s, an analysis of on- and off-budget surpluses will tend to
attribute the impact of the civilian and military retirement funds to the Social Security trust
fund.
Our primary result is that increases in the aggregate surplus of the trust funds are
offset – perhaps completely – by reductions in the federal funds surplus. In fact, using words
that sound more familiar, the trust fund surpluses result in enlarged deficits for the rest of the
government. We maintain that it is the existence of a unified budget that produces this offset.
Again confirming Smetters’ (2003) results, we show that prior to the adoption of a unified
budget in 1970, an increase in the surplus of the trust funds did not reduce saving by the rest
of the government. To hammer the point home, the government appears to have had the
ability to save before the advent of the unified budget, but has lost that ability since. The $3
trillion of assets in the trust funds represent the cumulated surpluses of their operations with
interest. However, the money has been spent or returned to taxpayers and not saved, at least
not by the federal government.
We also do not find empirical support for the Diamond hypothesis that increasing the
payroll tax to build up the trust fund results in increased personal saving. While we believe
that this argument is theoretically sound, we conclude that the effect is empirically negligible.
Thus, efforts to build up the trust funds are at least partially offset (and quite likely completely
offset) by reductions in government saving elsewhere, while having no discernable effect on
personal saving.

5

One implication of this argument is discussed by Bosworth and Burtless (2004): if the
government is unable to increase saving by building up its trust funds, then a system of
individual accounts for Social Security – rather than centralized investment of the trust fund
in equities – is more likely to produce an increase in national saving (since individual
accounts would not be included in the federal budget). However, our analysis suggests that
individual accounts are not necessary to remedy the situation. All that is required is a shift in
emphasis to the federal funds surplus as a measure of the government budget balance. This
number is already calculated and reported; however, attempts to balance “the budget” have
focused almost exclusively on the unified surplus.
This paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the history behind the
adoption of the unified budget. Section III presents our econometric model and results
pertaining to government saving. Section IV presents our empirical analysis of the
relationship between trust fund surpluses and personal saving. Section V concludes.

II.

The Unified Budget: A Historical Perspective
The unified budget was adopted in 1970 based on the recommendation of the 1967

President’s Commission on Budget Concepts. The idea underlying the Commission’s
recommendation was that the unified budget provides the best measure of the macroeconomic
impact of the public sector. Prior to 1970, three different measures of the budget surplus
existed. One measure came from the National Income Accounts. The other two measures
were derived from the administrative budget (which excluded the trust funds) and the
consolidated cash budget (which included the trust funds). Fiscal policy tended to focus on
the administrative budget.

6

The goal of the President’s Commission was to reconcile these various measures and
arrive at an appropriate definition of the budget. Regarding the trust funds, the Commission
argued: “The surplus or deficit in the administrative budget is a misleading guide for
measuring the fiscal impact of the budget on the economy.” (President’s Commission 1967, p.
27) Thus, the Commission strongly recommended the use of a unified budget. Since 1970
the main policy focus has been on the unified budget surplus (Elmendorf and Liebman 2000),
although federal funds surplus figures are also computed and published. The federal funds
numbers tend to be buried in the fine print of the massive budget documents.
Prior to the 1980s, the important trust funds operated largely on a PAYGO basis. As a
result, during this period, the choice of surplus measure – unified or federal funds - did not
matter much. However, a $200 billion per year gap between the federal funds and unified
surplus measures has opened up since 1985 – that is, the annual federal funds deficit is now
roughly $200 billion larger than the unified deficit commonly emphasized (Shoven 2003). A
widespread belief – based on the unified budget figures – is that the government ran large
surpluses in 1998-2001. However, the federal funds budget has consistently run deficits since
1969 (the single exception being a very small – $1.8 billion – surplus in 2000). Thus, the
large surpluses of 1998-2001 were a result of federal funds deficits being hidden by the trust
funds surpluses.
Conventional economic wisdom suggests that the government should attempt to
balance the budget at full-employment. Attempts to implement this approach have tended to
focus on the unified budget. For example, the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act, which
attempted to force a reduction in the federal deficit during the 1980s, established targets for

7

the unified budget only. Moreover, in public debate, references to “the surplus” typically
mean the unified surplus. For example, according to a CNN story published in 2000:
The federal budget surplus for fiscal year 1999 was $122.7 billion and $69.2 billion
for fiscal year 1998. Those back-to-back surpluses, the first since 1957, allowed the
Treasury to pay down $138 billion in national debt (Wallace 2000).
More accurately, however, the total federal debt did not fall in either 1998 or 1999. The
publicly held debt fell because the government was using the trust funds surpluses to finance
its operations. This resulted in an increase in debt held by the trust funds, which more than
offset the reduction in the publicly held debt. Which is the correct measure of the federal
debt? As discussed by Shoven (2003), if the trust fund assets are to be viewed as “real” assets
in any meaningful sense, then government debt held in the trust funds represents a real
liability for taxpayers. That is, from an accounting perspective, the trust funds cannot be
treated as assets by the programs they finance unless a corresponding liability is
acknowledged. The unified surplus fails to acknowledge such a liability by treating the trust
funds’ net income as money that is available to spend on other programs or rebate to
taxpayers.
In addition to its recommendation of a unified budget, the Commission also
emphasized the importance of issuing separate reports of the trust fund finances side-by-side
with the unified budget:
In many instances, in fact, [the Commission] sees merit in earmarking specific
revenue sources for well-defined programs of a long-run character. The need to
respect the integrity of trust funds, and the requirements of control and accountability,
in turn require the continued availability of trust fund receipt and expenditure figures
separate from those of other funds. (President’s Commission 1967, p. 27)
Thus, the Commission allowed for the continued earmarking of funds for Social Security and
other programs. An important question is whether such earmarking matters in any real sense.

8

Earmarked funds can be spent by the Treasury without explicit authorization (CBO 2002). In
a political economy framework, the earmarking of funds does matter (see, e.g., Bos 2000,
Marsiliani and Renstrom 2000), and we would certainly expect the buildup of the trust funds
to have real effects on the government’s spending priorities. However, the question with
which this paper is concerned is whether, in the aggregate, the trust funds can be used as a
vehicle for government saving; if so, then the buildup in the trust funds during the 1980s can
achieve its purpose of relieving the burden on future generations.
Smetters (2003) provides a useful summary of the various perspectives on this issue
with regard to the Social Security trust fund. The key criterion for determining whether the
trust funds represent a real government asset is whether an increase in the trust funds results
in a lower level of publicly held debt than there would have been otherwise. If so, they
represent real saving. Smetters finds empirical support for the perspective that the focus on
the unified budget invites the government to increase its non-Social Security spending
whenever the Social Security surplus increases.
We agree with this perspective, and we extend Smetters’ analysis to include all the
trust funds. Attempts to save in the trust funds treat the trust funds as real government assets.
But this is inconsistent with the use of a unified budget because the unified surplus treats the
trust funds surplus as money that is currently available to spend, rather than money that has
been earmarked for saving. The picture that emerges from our empirical analysis is that the
trust funds surpluses during the 1980s gave the government more flexibility to increase other
spending and cut taxes while still meeting Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, or other unified budget
deficit targets. In other words, when the government focuses on balancing the unified budget,
attempts to save in the trust funds are undermined. The higher than necessary payroll taxes

9

permit more spending and lower rates on other taxes, but they do not make future generations
wealthier.

III.

Econometric Analysis

We use macroeconomic time-series data from 1949-2003 to estimate the relationship between
the surpluses in the trust funds and federal funds. Our dataset excludes the transition quarter
in 1976-77 when the government changed the fiscal year. Our current-dollar trust fund and
federal funds surplus data come from Historical Table 1.4 of the FY 2005 Budget of the U.S.
Government; we convert these into constant (2000) dollars using the GDP deflator. Figure 1
shows the real trust funds and federal funds surpluses from 1949 through 2009, with the 200409 figures being the OMB projections from the 2005 U.S. Budget. It is clear from the figure
that increasing trust fund surpluses during the 1980s were accompanied by larger federal
funds deficits.
In order to determine whether this relationship holds up under formal econometric
analysis, we estimate the following equation:
FFSURPt = α + β ⋅ TFSURPt + γ ⋅ X t + ε t
where
FFSURPt = Real Federal Funds surplus in year t
TFSURPt = Real Trust Fund surplus in year t.
X t = a vector of control variables.

ε t = an independent, identically distributed error term.
In the regressions, we consider two alternative specifications of TFSURP and
FFSURP. First, we use the standard surplus measures discussed above and depicted in Figure

10

1. The standard measures count as trust fund revenue interest credited on the special-issue
government bonds held in the trust fund. The interest is paid by simply issuing more bonds to
the trust funds. These interest payments are treated as an expenditure in computing the
federal funds surplus. However, as discussed by Smetters (2003), this treatment of interest
payments may not be appropriate. The underlying theory suggests that if the trust funds earn
additional income from an excess of contributions over expenditures, this income is then
spent by the rest of the government. This argument does not, however, apply to interest
income the trust funds receive from the rest of the government. To address this issue, we
proceed analogously to Smetters and construct “modified” trust funds and federal funds
surpluses. The modified trust funds surplus is computed by subtracting interest received on
trust fund assets from our previous measure of the trust funds surplus; these interest payments
are then added to our previous measure of the federal funds surplus to obtain the modified
federal funds surplus.1 Both surplus measures are divided by real potential GDP in order to
reduce the possibility of heteroscedasticity.
The coefficient of interest is β . If β is close to 0, this suggests that the government’s
attempts to save in the trust funds have been successful: an increase in trust fund saving does
not affect saving by the rest of the government. On the other hand, if β is negative, an
increase in trust fund saving is offset by dissaving by the rest of the government; in particular,
if β = −1 , then an increase in trust fund saving has no impact on overall government saving.
This econometric model is analogous to that of Smetters (2003), who estimates the
relationship between the surplus in the Social Security trust fund and the surplus in the rest of
the budget (including the other trust funds).
1

The interest payment data were provided by Bob Kilpatrick of the Office of Management and Budget on May

11

Our control variables include the ratio of actual to potential GDP, the ratios of real
capped and uncapped wages to potential GDP, the nominal interest rate paid on the specialissue Treasury bonds held by the Social Security trust fund, and a quadratic time trend. Our
potential GDP data come from January 2004 Congressional Budget Office calculations, and
take into account factors such as the potential labor force and potential total factor
productivity. The potential GDP measure is adjusted for inflation using a factor provided by
the CBO; the actual GDP measure is adjusted for inflation using the GDP deflator. The ratio
controls for the fact that business cycle fluctuations are likely to have an impact on both the
federal funds and the trust funds surpluses.
The capped wage measure comes from the Social Security Administrations’ Annual
Statistical Supplement (Table 4.B1), and the uncapped wage measure from the National
Income and Product Accounts (Table 2.1). We adjust both measures for inflation using the
GDP deflator. Capped wages are not available for 1949 and 2003, so we impute these
amounts by assuming that the ratio of capped to uncapped wages was the same as in the
adjacent year. These two variables are intended to capture the impact of a mean-preserving
spread in wages on Social Security payroll tax receipts. Since the payroll tax is regressive, a
mean-preserving spread in wages is likely to reduce the trust funds surplus by lowering
payroll tax revenue; it is also likely to increase the federal funds surplus through the
progressive income tax. Therefore, omitting these two variables might lead to a downward
bias in the estimate of β .
The nominal special-issue interest rate data are from the Social Security
Administration. In each year, this variable is computed as the average of the 12 monthly
interest rates on new issues during the year. Including this variable is important for the
25, 2004.
12

specifications that use the standard surplus measure. Because interest payments flow from the
federal funds to the trust funds, an increase in the nominal interest rate will increase the
standard measure of the trust funds surplus and reduce the standard measure of the federal
funds surplus. Therefore, the omission of this variable will tend to bias β downwards. Since
this issue does not arise with the modified surplus measures, the interest rate variable is not
included in these specifications. 2
For each specification, we test for heteroscedasticity using the Breush-Pagan score test
against multiplicative heteroscedasticity. We also test for serial correlation in the error terms
using Durbin’s alternative test, in which the residuals from the original regression are
regressed on their lagged values (up to three lags) and all the independent variables. The pvalue for each of these tests (against the null hypothesis of no serial correlation or
heteroscedasticity) is reported in the results table for each specification. Our tests indicate
evidence of heteroscedasticity and first or second order serial correlation in several of the
specifications. The reader should note, however, that our test for heteroscedasticity is not
robust to the presence of serial correlation; thus, the heteroscedasticity test results may not be
valid for the specifications in which serial correlation is present. On the other hand, our serial
correlation test results are robust to heteroscedasticity because we use a heteroscedasticityrobust estimate of the variance-covariance matrix for the test equations.3 To address the
potential presence of heteroscedasticity and serial correlation, we report Newey-West
standard errors with a lag of two periods.4

We thank Peter Orszag for suggesting the last two points about the capped and uncapped wages, and the
nominal interest rate.

See Wooldridge 2002, Chapter 12, for a discussion of this issue.

1

One guideline for determining the lag for computing Newey-West standard errors is the integer portion of n 4 ,
where n is the sample size (see Wooldrige 2002, p. 397). In our case, this guideline implies a lag of two
periods.
13

Our baseline results are reported in Table 1. In all of our specifications, the coefficient
on the trust funds surplus variable is negative and statistically significant at the 5 percent
level. Adding covered and uncovered wages does lower the magnitude of the coefficient, but
by a relatively small amount. The coefficient on the nominal interest rate is positive
(unexpectedly) but not statistically significant; its inclusion barely changes the coefficient on
the trust funds surplus. Our preferred specifications are the ones that include the full set of
controls (the last two columns in the table); even though the interest rate coefficient has an
unexpected sign and is not statistically significant, we believe that theory strongly supports its
inclusion in the standard surplus measure regression. These specifications suggest that a $1
increase in the trust funds surplus reduces the federal funds surplus by $1.54 (for the standard
measures) or $1.44 (for the modified measures). Both estimates are significantly different
from zero and not significantly different from 1. A 95 percent confidence interval for the
magnitude of the coefficient is .56 to 2.53 for the standard measures and .49 and 2.41 for the
modified measures. Even the lower end of both confidence intervals implies an offset that is
economically significant. Thus, our results suggest that an increase in government saving via
the trust funds is at least partially – and perhaps completely – offset by a decrease in
government saving outside of the trust funds.
It is worth mentioning that our point estimates of the coefficient on the trust fund
variable differ considerably from those obtained by Smetters (2003). Smetters estimates that
a $1 increase in the Social Security surplus reduces the on-budget surplus by $2.76; this
estimate is statistically greater than 1, implying that an increase in off-budget saving actually
reduces overall government saving. A possible explanation for this difference is that the
government attempted to build up several trust funds simultaneously during the 1980s. Thus,

14

the coefficient of the off-budget surplus is likely to pick up some of the impact of the other
trust funds.
As discussed above, the unified budget was adopted in 1970. We have argued that it
is the focus on balancing the unified budget that gives rise to the government’s inability to
save in the trust funds. Thus, it is reasonable to split our time series into two periods – 19491969 and 1970-2003 – and re-run our regressions. Theory predicts that the coefficient of the
trust funds surplus variable should be close to zero prior to the adoption of the unified budget
and negative afterwards. The split-sample regression results are reported in tables 2 and 3.
As can be seen from Tables 2 and 3, the estimate of β over the 1970-2003 period is
negative and statistically significant; in this case, it is also significantly greater than 1 in
magnitude. However, in the pre-1970 period, the point estimates of β are not significantly
different from zero. This confirms our argument that the adoption of the unified surplus is the
factor that hinders the government’s ability to save in the trust funds. Smetters (2003) finds
the same qualitative result (no relationship pre-1970 and an inverse relationship post-1970)
for the on- and off-budget surpluses.
Overall, our results suggest that government saving has not increased despite the
almost $3 trillion accumulated in trust funds since 1985. Future generations may have lower
payroll taxes than they otherwise would have, but they will not have more resources. They
themselves will have to finance their lower payroll taxes with higher income taxes (or lower
government spending). The intergenerational burden sharing envisioned by the Greenspan
Commission has been thwarted.
Similar results emerge from cross country analysis. Bosworth and Burtless (2004)
estimate similar regressions for OECD countries and show that increases in Social Security

15

trust fund surpluses are at least partially offset by reduced surpluses in the rest of the
government. Since these countries use unified budgets, this result is as expected. Bosworth
and Burtless also show that at the state level in the U.S., surpluses in employees’ retirement
trust funds are not offset by reductions in saving by the rest of the government. One
explanation they propose is that, unlike national governments, state governments use a system
of accrual accounting under which pension funds are kept separate from the rest of the budget.
The issue regarding whether the unified budget affected the legitimacy of the trust
funds can be looked at another way. Consider a counterfactual situation where the excess
payroll tax receipts were used to fund individual accounts rather than to purchase government
bonds. In fact, to make the two cases almost identical, consider what would happen if the
individual accounts were 100% invested in U.S. government bonds. At first glance, the
money available to the rest of the government would be unchanged. However, the funding of
individual accounts would almost certainly be treated as an expense. The interest payments
on the government bonds in the individual accounts would also be treated as an expense. The
budget surplus would be lower by the amount of the cash flow surplus in social security and
the other trust funds (the new deposits into accounts) and the interest payments received on
existing bonds. That is, the surplus would have switched from what we now calculate as the
unified surplus to the much lower federal funds surplus. The saving in individual accounts
would not be treated as part of the surplus and thus less likely spent by the rest of government.
However, this accounting change could be adopted without individual accounts; what would
be required is separating the trust fund accounts from the rest of the budget and reporting the
federal funds budget as the primary assessment of the government budget and the target for
balancing at full employment.

IV.

Trust Fund Accumulations and Personal Saving
As discussed above, an increase in the trust funds surplus can raise national saving by

raising personal saving (Diamond 2003). According to this argument, increases in the
(regressive) payroll tax disproportionately affect low-income individuals, who tend to be
liquidity constrained. To the extent that the resulting trust funds surpluses are used to finance
income or other tax cuts, which disproportionately affect non-liquidity higher-income
individuals, they will tend to raise personal saving. This follows from the fact that higherincome individuals – who tend not to be liquidity constrained – have a higher marginal
propensity to save out of disposable income than the liquidity-constrained poor. Historically,
most of the increases in the trust funds have resulted from increases in the payroll tax. Thus,
to test for the “Diamond effect,” we regress the National Income and Product Accounts
measure of personal saving on the trust funds surpluses and our other macroeconomic control
variables. The results from various specifications of this regression are reported in Table 4.
The specifications that include all the controls suggest that a $1 increase in the trust
funds surplus may increase personal saving by between 56 and 66 cents. However, the
relevant coefficient is only statistically significant at the 5 percent level when using the
modified trust funds surplus measure. Given the sensitivity of the coefficient estimate across
our specifications, we conclude that we do not see strong evidence for the economic
significance of the Diamond effect.

Conclusions
The issues that this paper deals with are clearly important. The primary issue is

whether the assets in the federal trust funds will help future generations of workers finance the
retirements of the baby boom generation. Has the governmental policy of building up these
trust funds succeeded in transferring resources to the next generation of workers?
Unfortunately, the evidence of this paper suggests that the answer is “no.” Our empirical
analysis is consistent with the idea that the focus on the unified federal budget has
undermined the wealth accumulation aspect of the trust funds. The surplus revenues that the
trust funds have turned over to the rest of the government have been spent and not saved. As
a result, no extra wealth has been accumulated.
If the focus had been on balancing the federal funds budget instead of the unified
budget and if the government had been equally successful with that balancing, the total debt
of the government and the publicly held debt would have been $3 trillion lower. Future
generations would have been $3 trillion wealthier and the vision of the Greenspan
Commission would have been at least partially fulfilled. Of course, the focusing on the
federal funds budget would have revealed a number of things. First, the large surpluses that
we enjoyed in 1998-2000 never really existed, at least according to the federal funds accounts.
Second, the 2004 budget deficit is roughly $200 billion higher than reported and, third, the tax
cuts, which may have been necessary for business cycle reasons, were not merely a rebate of
sizable surpluses.
There is considerable debate as to whether the crisis in the financing of Social Security
occurs in roughly 2017 when payroll tax receipts are insufficient to finance benefits or in the
2040s when the Social Security trust funds are projected to be exhausted. From the

18

perspective of Social Security, the trust fund does represent real claims on the rest of the
government. Thus, the presence of the trust fund may prolong the life of Social Security
beyond the date at which tax receipts fall short of benefits payments. However, from the
perspective of future generations of workers, the trust funds do not represent incremental
wealth. Even if Social Security’s life is lengthened, workers 15 years from now will have to
pay off the obligations in the trust fund through increases in other taxes and cuts in other
government services. The trust funds themselves do not provide any assistance to future
generations of workers in coping with the inadequate income of Social Security to pay the
legislated benefits.
