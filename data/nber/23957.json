    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper makes the case for greater use of randomized experiments \u201cat scale.\u201d We review various critiques of experimental program evaluation in developing countries, and discuss how experimenting at scale along three specific dimensions \u2013 the size of the sampling frame, the number of units treated, and the size of the unit of randomization \u2013 can help alleviate them. We find that program evaluation randomized controlled trials published in top journals over the last 15 years have typically been \u201csmall\u201d in these senses, but also identify a number of examples \u2013 including from our own work \u2013 demonstrating that experimentation at much larger scales is both feasible and valuable.\n\n",
