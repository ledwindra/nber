Costs and Benefits of an Anti—Inflationary Policy:
Questions and Issues

ABSTRACT

This paper analyses how the output or unemployment cost of achieving a
sustainable reduction in the rate of inflation depends on the structure of
the wage—price process and how the !tsacrifi

ratio" can be minimized. In

models where the natural rate is invariant under the anti—inflationary
policies, price level inertia is not sufficient for a positive sacrifice

ratio. Without sluggishness in the core inflation rate, a zero sacrifice
ratio can be achieved simply through intelligent demand management. With
sluggish core inflation, the sacrifice ratio is positive unless intelligent

demand management is complemented by cost—reducing fiscal measures or

effective incomes policy. Letting the exchange rate float does not reduce
the sacrifice ratio. If core inflation is partly backward—looking and
partly forward—looking, current core inflation may be a function of current

and past expectations of future recessions. Conventional sacrifice ratio
calculations ignore forward—looking aspects of behaviour and may therefore

underestimate the true cost of disinflation. If there is hysteresis in the
natural rate (e.g. through a gradual adjustment of the natural rate towards
the actual rate) and if there is sluggish core inflation, the sacrifice
ratio will become infinite.

Whenever sluggish core inflation is present, credibility of the anti—
inflationary (monetary) policy alone cannot obviate a positive sacrifice
ratio.

I. Introduction

Unlike many contributions to this subject, the present paper has
the virtue that at any rate its title (which was chosen by the organizers

of the conferences) makes sense. As Hall [1981, p. 432] states
"Inflation is an outcome of economic processes, not an exogenous causal

influence". At the level of the economy as a whole, it is therefore
a nonsense to refer, as is often done, to the costs of inflation or

to the benefits from lower inflation. Since inflation is endogenous,
the benefits or costs of lower inflation can only be discussed sensibly

by specifying the changes in exogenous variables and parameters (policy
actions or rules, external events etc.) that bring about and sustain

the lower rate of inflation. Partial equilibrium or single—structural—
equation "costs of inflation" analyses are void of policy implications.
As regards the benefits from policies to achieve a sustained
reduction in the rate of inflation, we shall be brief, because we have nothing

much

to add to the received wisdom on the topic

1

First consider

a non—stochastic economy. We shall assume that a permanent reduction
in the proportional rate of growth of the nominal stock of money is a
necessary condition for a permanent reduction in the rate of inflation.
Unless debt neutrality prevails or government interest—bearing debt
is index—linked, the reduction in the growth rate of the nominal money
stock will have to be matched by an equal reduction in the growth rate
of the stock of government bonds in order to achieve sustained
reduction in the rate of inflation.

—2—

It is important to appreciate that it is the same institutional
feature of the economy that causes costs to be associated both with
policies that cause inflation and with policies to reduce inflation.

That feature is the existence of nominal contracts that are not perfectly

price level—or inflation—contingent. The reasons for the existence
of such contracts have to do with the advantages of using money in the
first place —— the benefits from using a common nulneraire, standard

of deferred payment, medium of exchange and means of payment. They
are either too obvious or too deep to be considered in this paper.

Bringing down inflation is costly because of the existence of non—

contingent money wage and price contracts. In a deterministic setting,
imperfect and incomplete indexation of prices and rates of return is the
main reason for welfare costs to be associated with policies that
cause inflation.

The only other cost is the 'relabeling cost",

i.e. the cost of changing prices more frequently, which can be
generalized to the cost of the disruption of well—established methods

of transacting business (Canton, 1982, p. 139).
The best—known cost of non—indexation is the loss of consumer
surplus suffered when the demand for real money balances declines as (and
to the extent that) the nominal interest rate rises in response to

an increase in the (expected) rate of inflation. With the nominal
rate of return on money balances assumed fixed (typically at zero)
the nominal interest rate represents the opportunity cost of holding

money. Partial equilibrium approaches take the real interest rate
as given and have the nominal interest rate rising one for one

—3—

with an increase in the (expected) inflation rate. This represents
a tax on the holding of money balances. If the demand for money is
interest—sensitive and money is produced costlessly, this will impose
a dead—weight loss of consumer surplus given by the trapezoidal area
under the (compensated) money demand function between the low inflation

and high inflation quantities of money demanded2. General equilibrium
approaches treat the real interest rate as endogenous and not necessarily
invariant to the policy changes that cause the higher rate of inflation.
In a multi—period setting the entire sequence of discounted instantaneous
(or single period) trapezoidal utility losses must be considered

[Feldstein 1979j.
Non—indexation or incomplete indaxation extends in practice well beyond

the rate of return on high-powered money balances, and affects private

contracts as well as tax laws and regulations. Extensive work on the
subject has been done by Fischer and Modigliani [1978],
Fischer [1981bJ.

When comparing a situation of low inflation with one of high
inflation, the lower level of welfare (presumable) enjoyed in the latter
can be attributed either to the policy that brings about the higher
inflation (i.e., higher monetary growth) or to the failure to implement
policies that permit a partial or complete adaptation to the higher

inflation. If indexation is cheap, let alone costless, dead—weight
losses, incurred because of a combination of inflation and incomplete
indexation, can be attributed with as much justice to the failure to

implement policies to adapt to inflation as to the policies that cause

—4—

the inflation. This holds for any undesired distributional consequences of

policies that cause inflation as much as for the inefficiencies that they
entail.
Turning to a stochastic world, a vast literature has sprouted in
recent years on the costs of variable or uncertain inflation and on the
links between expected inflation and the variability or uncertainty of the
3

price level, the rate of inflation or relative prices .

Even in determin-

istic models it is possible, if not all prices can be adjusted costlessly

mean inflation rate and the (anticipated) variability of relative prices. The

costs of such anticipated variability can e evaluated using conventional
deterministic welfare economic tools. In what follows only unanticipated
or currently unperceived variability, i.e. inflation or relative price

uncertainty,will be considered. Causal chains have been proposed running
from high (expected) inflation rates through to relative price uncertainty,
suggesting that inflation may raise the noise-to—signal ratio for relative
price movements, thus impairing the allocative efficiency of the price mechanism.
Since the expected rate of inflation, its variance and the variance

of relative prices are all jointly endogenous in any reasonable macroeconomic
model, it is very hard to understand what the "costs of inflation uncertainty"

literature is trying to say. It is certainly interesting to study the time
series behavior of mean inflation, of inflation variability and uncertainty
and of relative price variability and uncertainty (see e.g. Fischer [1981]).
By regressing any one of these on any subset of the remaining ones, one cannot

hope to extract a structurally invariant relationship. The statement
"high expected inflation causes highly uncertain inflation" makes no

sense. The statement "certain policies or events that cause the first
moment of the distribution function of inflation to increase also

tend to raise its second moment" does make sense.

E.G. :

if higher

—5—

mean monetary growth is associated with increasingly unpredictable
monetary growth, both the higher mean inflation and the increasing
unpredictability of inflation can be attributed to monetary policy.
Perhaps the argument is that there is a structurally invariant
relationship between mean monetary growth and the unpredictability of
monetary growth for a monetary aggregate with the following two properties.
First, it is the relevant causal one in the inflation process and second,
the parameters of its distribution function can only be chosen by the

authorities subject to some constraints. E.g. the authorities cannot
control monetary growth exactly, but they can choose the first two moments
of its distribution function, subject to the constraint that mean and

variance are positively related. Since it is likely to be welfare—reducing
for the authorities to throw more extraneous no1se into the system, a further
argument for lower mean money growth exists if the variance of the
innovation in the money stock process is an increasing function of the

expected rate of monetary growth. Unless this is the case, finding
a positive pattern of covariation between mean inflation and relative
price uncertainty carries no implications for monetary policy.
Note, that none of this provides an argument for maximizing the

predictability of future monetary growth rates but only for minimizing

the variance of the innovation in the money stock process. Consider e.g. the

monetary growth rule m

m is the logarithm

itself could be a non—stochastic known

function

—6—

of current and past realizations of random variables, i.e. it could be

governed by a non—stochastic feedback rule. While such rules tend to

make m+2 —

m+i,

say, less predictable, in period t and earlier, than

a non—stochastic open loop path for money growth, such-feedback rules

may well help diminish the undertainty that matters. Examples are
changes in the information content of observed market prices induced
by monetary feedback rules (Turnovsky [1980] Weiss [1980], Buiter
[1980, 1981]).

From the proposition that governments should not throw extraneous
random noise into the economic system by randomizing their monetary
policy rules, it also does not follow that minimizing uncertainty
about future inflation or future relative prices is sensible policy. E.g.

by freezing all relative prices through legislative fiat their
predictability is maximized but any shocks to demand or supply will have

to be absorbed through rationing and other disequilibrium mechanisms.
Random shocks to the system will, in general, be absorbed by unexpected
changes in prices, in quantities produced, sold and consumed and by
unexpected changes in the values of policy instruments such as the
money supply, which are set according to some contingent or conditional

rule. By removing the elements of conditionality in the monetary rule
to enhance the predictability of the future money stock path, shocks will

have to be absorbed in some other way. Only detailed analysis of fully
specified models can determine what kind of monetary rule maximizes
expected utility.

A final argument for policies consistent with low or zero inflation
is that price level stability (zero inflation) is the only stable

—7-.

equilibrium. Positive inflation inevitably entails rising rates of
inflation. (The symmetric argument for negative inflation rates is
not made; there have been hyper—inflations but no hyper—deflations).
The political economy of inflationary monetary growth creating
pressures for higher and more inflationary rates of monetary growth

has never been spelled out satisfactorily. The historical experience
of most OECD countries would seem to contradict it. If any inflation
carried in itself the seeds of a hyper—inflation (with some non—

negligible probability) the case for striving for price level constancy
would of course be strengthened considerably.

—8—

II. The cost of policies to achieve a permanent reduction in inflation.

In Part II of this paperwe shall consider the familiar Okun style
output costs of securing a lasting reduction in the rate of inflation.
There are well—known objectives to taking the cumulative net output loss
(perhaps discounted) associated with an anti—inflationary policy as
a measure of its cost .

It

ignores the benefits of additional output

produced at home by the unemployed and not recorded in GNP, as well

as the marginal valuation of their leisure and search time. We shall

proceed regardless for two reasons. First, it has been argued (see
e.g. Gordon [1973]) that if one attempts a conventional triangle approach

grounded in applied welfare economics, the answers don't come out all

that differeatly from the crude Okun's gap measure. Second, it is hard
to take seriously an approach that cannot differentiate between an employed

worker taking a vacation and a worker becoming unemployed. Conventional
inicroeconomic analysis models utility as increasing in leisure, i.e. leisure

is a "good thing", and thereby confines labour to the category of "bads". Overwhelming empirical evidence on the importance of work (i.e. of being employed,

of having a job) for most people's well—being, happiness and even sanity
has not made much of a dent in the "extended holiday" approach to
unemployment.

Formally, it is quite easy to combine the "leisure as a good thing"

and "work as a good thing" approaches. Consider the state—dependent

utility function v(•) given below. c is a vector of goods and services
other than leisure. L is the endowment

The utility function is well—behaved in consumption and leisure

(strictly increasing and quasi—concave). The benefit from being employed
is represented by the assumption that for any given c = c and £ =

L—.Q., Q)4

Depending on what further properties one attributes to the utility
function5 and on the budget constraints when employed and unemployed,

one could still have people choosing voluntary unemployment.

In this paper only conventional output gap costs will be considered.
Even if they have no clear welfare significance, it would still be
worthwhile from a positive economics viewpoint to know their magnitude.

Bringing down inflation with a policy—invariant natural rate.

In this section we consider models that have the long—run natural

rate property: the same level of real output (rate of unemployment)
is consistent with any steady—state and fully anticipated rate of inflation.

While output and unemployment can differ from their natural levels
outside the steady state, these natural levels themselves are taken to be

constant. For this class of modelswe shall show that price level inertia
is not sufficient to generate output costs of policies to bring down

inflation. For there to be such costs, inertia should attach to the
rate of change of the price level. A number of "Keynesian" models,
e.g. Buiter and Miller's [1981, 1982] variant of Dornbusch's [1976]

overshooting model, Calvo's [1982 a,b,c] continuous time version of

-10-

Taylor's [1980] staggered overlapping money wage contract rnode1
Mussa's [1981] sticky price model and Obstfeld and Rogoff's [1982.] version
of a price adjustment rule of Barro and Grossman t1976] all have the property
that, in principle, inflation can be reduced or eliminated costlessly.
well—designed and credible monetary and fiscal policy can make these
economic systems mimic the real behavior of a completely flexible money
wage and price economy.
After considering these models we analyze the cost of bringing

down inflation in models with sluggish core inflation. These costs,
and the properties of desirable anti—inflationary policies turn out to
depend crucially on the relative importance of backward—looking
("long term contracts") versus forward—looking ("expectations") determinants

of current inflation.

Closed economy models.

This subsection deals with closed economy models. Much of the
analysis only requires consideration of the wage—price block. Where a
complete, if rudimentary, macroeconomic model is required, the following
standard log—linear IS—LM model will be used.

Costless disinflation with price f1exibil.

Let capacity output or the natural level of output be denoted y. This

is treated as exogenous and constant. The benchmark case for costless
disinflation is represented by the flexible price level model which
complements (1) and (2) with the assumption of continuous full capacity
utilization.

(3) y=y
For simplicity it is assumed here and in what follows that the
initial position of the economy is one of full stationary equilibrium
with a high constant rate of monetary growth i.

All

models considered will

have the classical property that the steady state rate of inflation

equals the steady state rate of growth of money?
It is easily checked that, regardless of what the initial rate of

inflation happens to be, an unanticipated, immediately implemented
and permanent fixing of the rate of monetary growth

m(t)

will immediately and permanently set the rate of inflation at

expectations are rational. If the IS curve is vertical (y=0) and there

is a real balance effect (0) this follows trivially from the stronger
proposition that real money balances are determined uniquely by y and f.

If neither y nor A equal zero, the behavior of expected real money
balances is governed by

Thus, while the level of the real stock of money balances will,

in general, be a function of the rate of monetary growth (even across
steady states) through the effect of anticipated money growth on the
expected rate of inflation and thus on the nominal interest rate, the
adjustment of the real stock of money balances to a new rate of growth

of the nominal money stock will be instantaneous. The price level will
jump discontinuously if required to satisfy (4). After that the rate
of inflation equals the new constant rate of money growth.

Note that in this model the credibility of current announcements
of future policy is both necessary and sufficient for a sustained

reduction in inflation to any level. While, by construction, there never
are any output costs of bringing down inflation, a desired reduction in

inflation ma not be achievable, regardless of the actual past and current
path of monetary growth, simply because expectations concerning future

monetary growth are sufficiently pessimistic. Inflation, and policies
to combat inflation, are exclusively forward—looking. I shall return to
this credibility issue when I discuss the fiscal preconditions for
a sustained deceleration of monetary growth below.

In all four cases the price level, p, is treated as predetermined:
it cannot move discontinuously in response to current changes in

expectations about the future. Also in all four cases, the rate of change
of the price level is an increasing function of excess demand pressure,

measured as the excess of the level of current output (which is viewed

as demand—determined) over the natural level of output. In equations (7), (8) and
(9) it is only current excess demand which, given "core' inflation, affects current

inflation. In Calvo's model both current and anticipated future excess
demand affects current inflation. Equations (7), (8) and (9) only
differ in the augmentation term, or core inflation —— the rate of inflation

when there is no excess demand or supply. In equation (7) core inflation
is identified with the right hand side derivative of the money stock path:

.i (t) =— r.

In equation (8) core inflation is given by p, which is the right—hand side

calculated 1n equation (5). Mussa's equation (9), as developed

Note that the current contract price v(t) is non—predetermined. The general

A positive (zero, negative) steady state rate of inflation requires a
current contract price, v(t), above (equal to, below) the current general
price level, p(t).
It will be apparent that all four mechanisms in equations (7) — (10)

have flexible core inflation. It would appear that simply reducing
monetary growth to i,

say, and keeping it there would be sufficient

—16--

to reduce inflation in (7) without Output costs. In equations (8),
(9) and (lOa,b) the further proviso of credibility of current announcements of future reductions in monetary growth has to be added.

The reason that this isn't quite correct is that a cet. par.
reduction in money growth would in general affect the money market and

output market. To effect a permanent reduction in inflation at full
employment other policy parameters will have to be changed when monetary

growth is reduced. Steady—state output y = y is, from (4), sustained
by monetary and fiscal policy as follows:

y(t)

+kyA±ky(A±ky) (m(t) -p(t))

The long—run effect of a reduction in money growth is to reduce
inflation one—for—one, reduce the nominal interest rate (but less than

one—for—one if there is a real balance effect ) and thus raise the

demand for real money balances. In the classical flex—price model
the real money balances required to effect an instantaneous transition

to low inflation at full employment comes about through a discontinuous
jump down in the price level. With a predetermined price level, the
required increase in real money balances can instead be achieved by
a discrete, discontinuous increase in the level of the nominal money stock
at the same time, t, that its rate of change is reduced permanently.
The required money jump is given by:

(12a) dm(t) =

d

—17—

Alternatively, expansionary fiscal policy could accompany the
reduction in money growth in such a way as to leave the nominal interest

rate unchanged. The required fiscal expansion is given by

(12b) df=—1d
This fiscal action relies on the direct aggregate demand effect of

increased public spending or lower taxes. We shall show below
how cost and price reducing indirect tax cuts could be used as a substitute
for an increase in the nominal money stock as a means for achieving
an increase in real money balances at a given before—tax price level.
It can be checked easily that provided the money stock is raised

according to (12a) or a fiscal stimulus is provided according to (12b)
when monetary growth is lowered to .i, the rate of inflation will settle

immediately and permanently at i while output remains equal to y
11
throughout.

For Calvo's model the existence of costless disinflation policies

may not be quite as transparent as for the other three. First note that,

The dependence of the current price level on a "twosided" moving
average of output expectations will re—emerge in a slightly modified
form when inflation inertia is added to price level inertia.
If monetary or fiscal policy actions to maintain full employment

when the monetary growth rate is reduced are ruled out, the increased
demand for real money balances resulting from a successful anti—inflation-

ary policy can only be satisfied by a lowering of the price level path
relative to the nominal money stock path. This will involve unemployment
and excess capacity in all four sticky price level models. E.g.. in the

The net output cost of reducing steady state inflation decreases
as the short—run Phillips curve steepens and the interBst sensitivity
of money demand decreases.

These costs of bringing down the price level will be different
for the four price adjustment mechanisms considered in this section.
They are not considered any further here because of space constraints.

The methods of the next section dealing with inflation inertia can be

brought to bear on the problem of price level inertia with obvious
modifications.

Inflation inertia.

The simplest way of introducing inflation inertia is by postulating
a backward—looking adaptive process for core inflation, ri, as in (14a,b).

It is now no longer possible to avoid paying the output or unemployment
cost of bringing down inflation merely by manipulating aggregate demand

reduction in inflation requires a reduction in core inflation. Since

This loss measure can not be altered by

changing the timing or the intensity of the anti—inflationary package.

Given , and the desired reduction in steady state inflation, the
net output cost is a constant. (See e.g. Miller [1979], Buiter and
Miller [1982, 1983], Miller and O'Donnell [1983]).
Clearly, with discounting, policy makers will not be indifferent
between different trajectories with the same net output cost. We shall
not address these issues as they are both well—understood (see e.g.

Phelps [1972] and Hall [1976]) and comparitively unimportant: characterizing
efficient policies (and inefficient policies!) would seem to be more

useful than searching for an optimal policy.
The major drawback of the model of core inflation in equation (14b)

is the complete irrelevance for current core inflation of current and/or

past anticipations of future economic events. To remedy this (14b) is

replaced by (iSa, b). Core inflation, i,

is

a backward—looking

exponentially declining moving average of past "contract inflation", q,

while q is a forward—looking moving average of future expected inflation.

Comparing this with Calvo's model in equation (iDa, b) two differences

compared to (lOa, b). Inertia now attaches both to the level and the
first derivative of the price level path. Second, the mean lags of the
and of the forward—looking

backward—looking core inflation process,
contract inflation process,

are permitted to be different from each

other.

inflation adjusts more quickly than core inflation or the mean lag

Equation (17b) shows that "current contract inflation" q(t) can be
brought down discontinuously by announcing, at t,a credible path of
future recession.

Core inflation ir(t) is a function of the

expectations, formed at each instant in the past, of the entire future

path of the output gap. It can only come down (gradually) in response
to credible announcements that policies to generate a recession will
be pursued in the future.

To get a better appreciation of the cost of bringing down inflation
in this model,we now consider an example of a specific path for
expected output.
The initial position at t0 is one of current and expected future

full employment with actual, core and current contract inflation all equal

to each other. At t0 output is unexpectedly lowered to y(t0) < y. The
output gap is then expected to decay exponentially at a rate y so that

Consider

(the

this case actual inflation and current contract inflation

have been eliminated immediately and permanently, but the output cost

is still to come. This would be obvious to an observer who can measure
core inflation, which has yet to be brought down. It will be shown
below, that there exist policies that reduce both actual and core
inflation to any desired level before any of the output costs have

actually

been incurred. This raises the problem of time inconsistency

and credibility of policy.
"Gradualism'T

versus "Cold—turkey"

It can be seen from (19b) and (20a) that if y is larger (smaller)

than ,

current contract inflation will on impact fall below

(stay above) its new long—run equilibrium level. This might suggest that

a short sharp recession would, by changing current contract inflation
promptly, be a more effective means of bringing down core inflation

than a longer and milder recession. In fact the opposite is the case.
From (20a, b) it follows that, holding constant the cumulative net output

—24--

loss

y(t0)

a deeper initial recession (a smaller value of y (t0))

,

followed by a faster recovery (a larger value of y) would produce a smaller

reduction in steady-state inflation. The reason is, from (17a), that
later expected output gaps, although discounted as regards their effect
on ir(t), are also counted again and again (in fact continuously) on the

interval t0 —

In

t.

the presence of inflation inertia which is due to contractual or

other institutional arrangements rather than to sluggish expectation
adjustments, there are "diminishing returns" to cold turkey deflation

and gradualism is preferable. Only if a short sharp shock can break
down the nominal inertia, i.e. if the adjustment equations (15a,b)

or (16a,b) are not structurally invariant to certain dramatic changes.
in the policy regime, is there a case for anti—inflationary heroics.

Time inconsistency and the timing of.anti—inflationary benefits and

2c25ts.
It has already been shown that it is possible, through credible
policy announcements, to bring down actual and current contract inflation
imnediately ——

before

the output losses (whose expectation generated this

reduction in inflation) have been incurred. It will be apparent from equations
(17a,b,c) that it is also possible, if policy announcements are credible,

to bring down core inflation gradually (i.e. over any finite time interval)
to any desired level before any of the output costs have been incurred.

that is required.

Having achieved the desired reduction in core inflation at t=t without
actually having suffered any output costs as yet, the temptation
to renege on the earlier commitment to create a recession between
t and t gould be hard to resist.

The argument that the recession must take place in order to validate

and confirm the expectations held between t=t and t=t and thus to preserve
or invest in credibility for future policy announcements is unlikely

to prove apolitical winner. Why have a recession when core inflation
has already subsided? A policy maker treating bygones as bygones will
at t=t and beyond, keep output at its capacity level.

—

—

—26—

What this suggests is that any optimal policy will be time—inconsistent
(Kydland and Prescott [1977], Buiter [1981, 1983bJ1 if it has the property
that some output costs still have to be incurred (if previous expectations

are to be validated) after the inflation objectives have been achieved.
Unless credible precommitment is possible such policy announcements
will not be believed by the private sector.
Time consistent policies must be characterized by a better matching

of the time profiles of costs and benefits: if a credible strategy
cannot have the costs following the benefits, the recession will have

to be brought forward in time. If a speedy reduction in inflation is
sought, a deep, short recession will be the only credible strategy.
It

has already been shown that "short—sharp shocks" of this kind are

likely to be inefficient.
The model under consideration not only has implications for policy
design but also for policy evaluation. Consider again the general
expressions (17a,b,c).

Conventional cost measures focus on output

or unemployment costs incurred up to the time that a given reduction

in core inflation has been achieved. When forward—looking expectations
and inflation inertia play a role, as they do in this model, some, most
or all of the costs attributable to the reduction in core inflation
may be incurred after the anti—inflationary objective has been achieved.

Some Open Economy Consideratons and the Sensible Use of Fiscal Policy in a
Disinflationary Programme.

In an open economy, appreciation of the exchange rate might seem to
offer a mechanism for bringing down inflation more rapidly or at less
cost than in a closed economy or an economy on a fixed exchange rate.
This will be considerered in an open economy extension of the model

with backward—looking core inflation given in (14 a,b). Possible direct
cost and price effects of direct and indirect taxes are also introduced here.

They can be applied to all closed economy models in an obvious way. The
economy is a price taker in the world market for its imports, whose world

price is p*, and in international financial markets. The country has some
market power in the market for its exportable. Perfect capital mobility

and international asset substitutability are assumed. r* is the foreign
nominal interest rate. w denotes domestic costs, i.e. labour costs per
unit of output or even the CD? deflator at factor cost; p is the consumer
price index, e the price of foreign exchange, g exhaustive public spending,

T. the rate of indirect taxation and T the income tax rate. The model is

The model is similar to the one considered in Buiter and Miller

[1982, 83]. Note that taxes have both aggregate demand effects (equation
26) and direct cost effects (equations (23) and (24)). Only a fraction
of an increase in income tax rates is translated into higher wage settle-

ments (equation (23)). One interpretation of (23) is that it is the

(adjusted) after—taxmoneywage w —

Td

that is predetermined or sticky rather

than the before tax wage w. Note that the consumer price index can move
discontinuously, even if w is predetermined, through changes in indirect

tax rates and in the exchange rate. The latter influences the c.p.i.
through the share of imports in final consumption 1 — ct.

The familiar closed economy output costs given in equation (15) are
found back as the first term on the right—hand side of (30b).

They can be

reduced by an appreciation of the real exchange rate, c, by a cut in indirect
taxes and, if

0, by a cut in direct taxes.

A balanced budget cut in indirect taxes matched by an increase in direct
taxes helps reduce the output cost of disinflation only if direct tax
increases don't raise before tax wage settlements one—for—one.

the increased stock of real balances associated with a lower

rate of monetary growth will require a loss of competitiveness to maintain
equilibrium in the output market if (5 + 6)

> . Assuming

that there

is no long—rin effect on competitiveness from a reduction in the rate of
inflation, any favourable short—run or impact effects on the price level,
the rate of inflation and the core rate of inflation from an initial
appreciation of the exchange rate will not lower the undiscounted cumulative
net output cost of securing a sustained reduction in core inflation.

Buiter and il1er [1982, 1983] show that, on impact, a reduction in monetary
growth will be associated with a discrete, jump appreciation of the nominal

exchange rate (a step down in e and c). If e jumps down, so, from (24),
does p and so, from (25), does iT.

Core inflation jumps on impact but the

apparent reduction in output cost that this entails is nullified by the net
depreciation of the real exchange rate that will be required during the

remainder of the adjustment process to restore competitiveness. Only if
the short, sharp shock of a sudden revaluation breaks down the inertia
captured in (23) and (25) will it help reduce the output cost of bringing
down inflation.

—31—
In principle, by using indirect and, if

0, direct tax cuts to

melt core inflation instantaneously, a costless and immediate transition

to a sustained lower rate of inflation is possible. The higher stock of
real money balances demanded in a low inflation equilibrium can be provided
either by engineering a step increase in the level of the nominal money
stock at the same time its growth rate is reduced or by cutting taxes.
Indirect tax cuts will do the job and so will direct tax cuts, if

# 0

and if it is the after—tax money wage rather than the before—tax money

wage that is predetermined. If step adjustments in m are ruled out,
immediate attainment of the new long—run equilibrium values of m — p and IT
while maintaining full employment will in general require use of all three
fiscal instruments, g, T. and Td.

Finally, in the context of this model, incomes policy can be seen
as the ability to !boverridel the core inflation adjustment equation

(25). An extreme version would permit the authorities to pick a new
starting value for ri.

The model clearly isn't rich enough to suggest

reasons why such policies have a habit of

breaking

down.

Hysteresis

in the natural rate.

One of the most striking macroeconomic coincidences of the last
fifteen years has been the way in which estimates of the natural rate
of unemployment have moved up, along with the actual rate of unemployment.
In this subsection we consider the implications of the hypothesis that

this co—movement represents a causal influence running from current
and past actual unemployment to the current natural unemployment rate.
Letting —y stand for the actual unemployment rate and —y for the natural

rate, we nostulate that

R(t) stands for whatever structural factors or policies may affect
the natural rate (union power, unemployment benefits, minimum wage
etc .).

The second term on the right—hand side of (35) and the first term

on the right—hand side of (35') represent the hypothesis that unemployment
destroys human capital by having a negative effect both on attitudes

towards working and the aptitude for work. The idea is an old one.
Recent formalizations can be found

in

Buiter and Gersovitz [1981],

Hargreaves Heap [19801 , Gregory [1982, 1983] and Gregory and Smith
[1983 1 .

Clearly, as itten in (35) the

hypothesis is

too strong, since no bounds are set on the natural rate in the long run:

by

selecting

an approDriate path for unemployment, the natural rate

can be steered to any level, Such global hysteresis is implausible.
Over some finite range of unemployment rates, the hypothesis may, however,

—33.-

have merit.

(35) should be viewed as the log—linear approximation

in the relevant range of unemployment rates to a model with local

hysteresis. While the long—run or stationary Phillips curve

is

vertical,

it can be made vertical at any point within that range.
To keep the exposition brief, the simple sluggish core inflation
model of equations (14a,b) is added to (35).

It is, of course,

still true that

(t)

=

(t0)

+

f[Y(s) - (s)]ds

Since the natural rate no longer is invariant under the disinflation

process, deviations from the natural rate cease to be a useful measure
of cost. In the absence of tax cuts or incomes policy, core inflation
can only be lowered by raising the actual unemployment rate above the

natural rate. This, however, will, by (35') begin to raise the natural
rate, thus reducing gradually the disinflationary effect of any given
increase in the actual rate.

The disinflationary effect of any given increase in unemployment above

that same steady state reduction in inflation can be achieved by having
the same constant increase in unemployment for only a finite period
of time.

The simple hysteresis model outlined here has much the same implications
for the inflation—unemployment process as does entering the rate of change
of output (unemployment) rather than its level as an argument in the

Phillips curve. The simplest version of this model is

The striking imrlicaion of this model is that all anti—inflationary
gains from a contractionary policy are completely reversed if the economy

is permitted to recover. As Tobin [1980, p.El] says "It is possible that
there is no i:AIRU, no natural rate, except one that floats with actual history.

—35—

It is just possible that the direction the economy is moving in is at least
as important for acceleration and deceleration as its level. These
possibilities shouid give policy makers pause as they embark on yet another
application of the orthodox demand management cure for inflation".

Note that equation (37b) is consistent with some of the early work on

Phillips curves, which argued that both the level and the rate of change
of unemployment could be significant in inflation equations but ignored
endogenous core inflation (e.g. Phillips (1958) and Lipsey (1960)).

This similarity between the hysteresis model and the model of eqiations
(36) and (l1b) is especially striking when we consider the

hysteresis model, of a constant path y(s) =

adjustment of core inflation through rational perception and anticipation

of credible policy actions produces a sacrifice ratio of zero. The
hysteresis model with gradually adjusting core

inflation again yields an

sacrifice ratio. Not because, as with the old Phillips curve,

core inflation never adjusts but because the natural rate adjusts gradually

government's fiscal program by considering the government's comprehensive

Eventual monetary growth is governed in steady srite by the trend
public sector current account (or consumption account) deficit, with
debt service evaluated at the real interest rat.e net of the natural

rate of growth. This deficit measure can differ dramatically from the
conventionally measured public sector financial deficit or PSBR, which
is often and erroneously taken as a guide to eventual monetization.

III. Conclusion.

One conclusion that emerges strongly from this paper is the importance

of fiscal policy in securing a lasting reduction in inflation at least

cost. First, the long—run reduction in monetary growth which is necessary
for a sustained reduction in inflation is only credible if it is consistent
with the government's spending and tax programs and its outstanding

non—monetary assets and liabilities. Second, indirect tax cuts (and
under certain conditions direct tax cuts) can be used in ways first
suggested by Okun [1978] to secure a painless melting away of core

inflation. Tax cuts or a once—and—for all increase in the level of the
nominal money stock path must also be used in order to provide the higher
stock of real money balances demanded when the inflation rate is lower
at a given price level rather than through a further downward shift
in the price level path.
A final comment suggested by the analysis of the paper relates to the
apparent contrast between the findings of R. J. Gordon who has documented
many historical episodes during which bringing down inflation appears
to have been costly (Gordon [1982]) and I. S. Sargent who finds that
the ends of four hyperinflations in the post—World War I era were achieved

without dramatic output losses (Sargent [1982]). These findings can be
reconciled by arguing that during hyperinflations inflation inertia
(if not price level inertia) disappears. All the advantages of longer
term non—contingent nominal contracts are overridden by the need to

revise prices almost continuously. During hyperinflations (at any rate

—42—

in their final phases) the inflation process is characterized by models
like the ones in equations (8), (9) and (lOa,b) or even by the purely

classical flexible price model.
If there is no inflation inertia but still some pr.ice level inertia,

optimal anti—inflationary policy has the following features. First, a
credible announcement of current and future reductions in monetary

growth. This was provided by fiscal reform and currency reform plus
the general realization that something had to be done and was going to be

done to stop the hyperinflations. Second, a once—and—for all increase
in the level of the nominal money stock to raise the stock of real money

balances without any need to lower the price level path. The real world
counterpart to this were the very large increases in the nominal money
stocks in the periods following the sudden ending of the hyperinflations

[Sargent, op.cit.J. Such money stock jumps make no sense in a flexible
17
price model but may be called for in models with price level inertia.
Gordon considered episodes of moderate inflation. Long—term non—
continoent nominal contracts are adopted because they permit economic
agents to economize on frequent, costly renegotiations, on the search and
information costs of first identifying all possible relevant contingencies
and then monitoring them and on the costs of enforcing complicated

conditional contract clauses. Continuously variable and perfectly flexible
prices or fully contingent contracts are costly and undesirable when
the benefits from changing prices frequently outweigh the costs.
In moderate inflations, long—term nominal contracts are still viewed as

viable and desirable by private agents. Such changes in the length

—43—

of these contracts and in other relevant characteristics as one would
expect to occur when the trend rate of inflation changes, are likely to
be second—order for the range of inflation rates experienced in most

OECD countries since World War II. With the unconditional long—term
nominal contract structure intact, even fully credible announcements
of future reductions in monetary growth will not remove the need for
a period of (expected) output losses and unemployment if inflation is to
be brought down.

Footnotes

1.

An elegant statement and extension of the traditional theory
of the welfare costs of inflation is Fischer {1981b].

2.

This assumes that lump—sum taxes are available to the government.
If higher monetary growth and the associated higher inflation
increase the real value of new money issues (if the elasticity
of demand for real money balances with respect to the interest rate
is less than unity) the same real public spending program can be
financed with lower explicit taxes. If these taxes are
distortionary, the usual welfare loss measure overstates the
true cost.

3.

The most careful and informative mark in this area has been done
by Fischer [1981a,b, 1981]. See also Taylor [1981].

v(,f—i,1) >vC,L,O) for any 2 (O<2<L) would mean that even without
any pecuniary advantage of employment over unemployment, people
would choose to be employed. It is a much stronger condition than
