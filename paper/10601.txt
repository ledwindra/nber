Peace and War in Territorial Disputes
Herschel I. Grossman
NBER Working Paper No. 10601
June 2004
JEL No. D74, H56
ABSTRACT
Why do sovereign states sometimes fail to settle territorial disputes peacefully? Also, why do even
peaceful settlements of territorial disputes rarely call for the resulting border to be unfortified? This
paper explores a class of answers to these questions that is based on the following premise: States
can settle a territorial dispute peacefully only if (1) their payoffs from a peaceful settlement are
larger than their expected payoffs from a default to war, and (2) their promises not to attack are
credible. This premise directs the analysis to such factors as the advantage of attacking over both
defending and counterattacking, the divisibility of the contested territory, the possibility of recurring
war, the depreciation or obsolescence of fortifications, and inequality in the effectiveness of
mobilized resources.

Throughout history territorial disputes have been the principle source of conflict
leading to war . . . [Yet,] in the post-World War II period over one-half of all
territorial disputes did not involve the threat or use of military force . . . While
most wars . . . involve conflicts over territory, many territorial disputes do not
pose a high risk of war. (Paul Huth, 1996, pages 6-10).
Why do sovereign states sometimes fail to settle territorial disputes peacefully?

Also,

why do even peaceful settlements of territorial disputes rarely call for the resulting border to
be unfortified?

These questions arise because in fact most territorial disputes are settled

peacefully, and because, war being costly, it is natural to conjecture that every territorial
dispute should aﬀord a peaceful settlement. Also, in the same spirit, it is natural to conjecture that peaceful settlements of territorial disputes should avoid the costs of fortifying the
resulting border.
Attempts to explain why states sometimes choose to go to war commonly focus on the
eﬀects of incomplete information.1 The present paper, without denying the historical importance of incomplete information as a cause of war, explores another class of answers to
the question of why some territorial disputes result in war. This class of answers is based on
the following premise:
States can settle a dispute peacefully only if (1) their payoﬀs from a peaceful
settlement are larger than their expected payoﬀs from a default to war, and (2)
their promises not to attack are credible.
1

Dagobert Brito and Michael Intriligator (1985) show how incomplete information, by causing a state to be

overly optimistic about its prospects for winning a war cheaply, can prevent a peaceful settlement of a dispute.
James Fearon (1995) and Herschel Grossman (2004) discuss historical examples in which overoptimism seems
to have been an important factor in the decision to go to war. Also, because of incomplete information, going
to war can be a worthwhile investment in reputation. As Fearon (1995, page 400) puts it, “States employ
war itself as a costly signal of privately known and otherwise unverifiable information about willingness to
fight...[and] as a credible means to reveal private information about their military capabilities.”

1

In other words, states can settle a dispute peacefully only if a peaceful settlement is on their
contract curve and also is subgame perfect. Given this premise the question of why states
sometimes choose to go to war becomes why do some territorial disputes not aﬀord peaceful
settlements that satisfy these two conditions.
Recognition of the problem of credibility also suggests an answer to the question of why
borders are usually fortified:
Although fortifications are costly, fortifications can help to make a peaceful settlement credible.
This answer is embodied in the popular observation, “Good fences make good neighbors.”
More generally, the possibility that fortifications are the key to peaceful settlements is embodied in the prescription: Qui desiderat pacem, preparet bellum. In this context, fortifications
include but are not limited to defensive works that are literally on the border.
Analytical Framework
Assume that two sovereign states, State 1 and State 2, face a newly arisen dispute over
control of a valuable territory. Either these states settle this dispute peacefully or by default
they fight a war to settle the dispute. A peaceful settlement would give each state control
of a non-negative fraction of the contested territory, with the resulting border being either
unfortified or fortified. A war would give each state a non-negative probability of winning
control of the entire contested territory.
Within this framework a state’s strategy set consists of the following elements:
• the amount to spend to mobilize resources in the event of a default to war;
• the amount to spend to construct fortifications in the event of a peaceful settlement;
• whether or not to agree to a peaceful settlement;
• whether to keep or to break a promise not to attack;
• the amount to spend to mobilize resources if it were to break a promise not to attack;
2

• the amount to spend to mobilize resources for a counterattack if the other state were
to break a promise not to attack.
The core choice-theoretic assumption is that the states choose the elements of their strategy sets to maximize the expected payoﬀ for which each element is relevant. For example,
each state chooses the amount to spend to mobilize resources in the event of a default to
war to maximize its expected payoﬀ from a default to war. In addition the analysis assumes
that in choosing its strategy set each state takes the other state’s strategy set as given.2
To circumscribe the analytical framework the model maintains the following simplifying
assumptions:
• The two states put the same value on controlling the contested territory. They also
put the same value on controlling any part of the contested territory. These valuations
take no account of any preference of the inhabitants of the contested territory to be
aﬃliated with one state or the other.3
• Attacking has an advantage over defending in the sense that with equal amounts spent
to mobilize resources for an attack and to construct fortifications the probability of the
attacker prevailing would be larger than one half. In the same sense, attacking has an
advantage over counterattacking – that is, there is an advantage to striking first.
• The states behave as if they are unitary and autonomous agents. Neither their internal
politics nor their relations with other states bear on this dispute.4
2

An alternative would be to assume that one state is a Stackelberg leader along the lines of the models

in Dmitriy Gershenson and Grossman (2000) and in Grossman and Mendoza (2004).
3

In contrast Alberto Alesina and Enrico Spolaore (1997, 2003, 2004) analyze models in which the prefer-

ences of inhabitants for public goods determine the incorporation of regions into sovereign states.
4

Recent studies of the relation between politics and interstate war include Michelle Garfinkel (1994),

Gregory Hess and Athanasios Orphanides (1995, 2001), and Paul Huth (1996). In a study of civil conflicts
Barbara Walter (2002) argues that in the past the intervention of third parties has been critical in making
peaceful settlements credible.

3

• In evaluating the costs of a war the states consider only the amounts spent to mobilize
resources. The states ignore the possible havoc of war.5
• In choosing its strategy set neither state faces a binding constraint on its ability to
mobilize resources. This assumption implies that no elements of the strategy set call
for a total mobilization of resources.
• All relevant parameters are common knowledge.
This last assumption implies that the states can correctly assess the credibility of each
other’s promises not to attack. Hence, this model abstracts from the possibility of a surprise
attack that contravenes a peaceful settlement. In this model war occurs only if the states
fail to reach a peaceful settlement.
To focus on the essential elements of the choice between peace and war, the analysis also
initially makes the following working assumptions:
• The whole of the territory is neither more not less valuable than the sum of its parts.
• The winner of a war would get permanent control of the contested territory.
• Fortifications neither depreciate nor become obsolete.
• The states have the same eﬀectiveness of amounts spent to mobilize resources.
Eventually the analysis relaxes each of these working assumptions.
The Consequences of a Default to War
Let Ni , i ∈ {1, 2}, denote the expected payoﬀ for State i from a default to war. Given
that the winner of a war would get permanent control of the contested territory, we have
(1)

Ni = pi V − Ri ,

where pi , pi ∈ [0, 1], denotes the probability that State i would win a war that these
5

If a war could cause significant havoc, then taking account of the expected havoc would decrease the

expected payoﬀ from a default to war and would enhance the possibility of a peaceful settlement.

4

states fight by default, where V, V ∈ (0, ∞), denotes the present value for either state of
having permanent control of the contested territory, and where Ri , Ri ∈ (0, V ), denotes
the amount that State i would spend to mobilize resources in the event of a default to war.
Equation (1) says that the expected payoﬀ for State i from a default to war equals the product
of the probability that it would win the war and the value of having permanent control of
the contested territory, minus the amount that it would spend to mobilize resources.
To determine the probability that State i would win a war that these states fight by
default, assume that pi depends on Ri and Rj , j ∈ {1, 2}, j 6= i, according to the
contest-success function,
(2)

pi =

Ri
.
Ri + Rj

In equation (2) pi is an increasing concave function of the ratio, Ri /Rj . Equation (2)
incorporates both the assumption that the dispute is newly arisen and, hence, that the
contested territory is initially unfortified and the working assumption that the states have
the same eﬀectiveness of amounts spent to mobilize resources.6
In the event of a default to war, to maximize its expected payoﬀ State i would choose
Ri to satisfy the first-order condition,7

− 1 = 0.
dRi

Using equation (2) to calculate ∂pi /∂Ri , this first-order condition implies the reaction
function,
6

Related analyses of the causes of war in Fearon (1995) and in Grossman (2004) take the probabilities of

winning a war and the costs of a war as given. In contrast, the present analysis, which follows the lead of
Garfinkel (1990) and Robert Powell (1993), starts by specifying contest-success functions, given by equation
(2) and by equation (9) below, and then shows how the probabilities of winning a war and the credibility of
promises not to attack derive from the choices that states would make to mobilize resources.
7

This first-order condition, as well as other first-order conditions specified below, accords with the as-

sumption that neither state faces a binding constraint on its ability to mobilize resources.

(3)

Ri =

q

V Rj − Rj .

Solving equations (3) for R1 and R2 and substituting into equations (1) and (2) we obtain
(4)

R1 = R2 = V /4

and

N1 = N2 = V /4.

Equations (4) imply that in a default to war spending to mobilize resources would dissipate
half of the value of having permanent control of the contested territory.
A Peaceful Settlement
Suppose that these states, seeking an alternative that is preferable to a default to war,
were to attempt to settle their territorial dispute peacefully. Specifically, suppose that these
states were to consider a peaceful settlement with three provisions:
• The states divide control of the contested territory with State i getting permanent
control of the non-negative fraction ki , where ki + kj = 1.
• Each state can construct a permanent fortification on the resulting border. State i
spends Ri∗ , Ri∗ ∈ [0, ∞), to construct its fortification. If Ri∗ equals zero, then the
border is unfortified.
• Each state promises not to attack in an attempt to gain control of the entire contested
territory.
State i would prefer this peaceful settlement to a default to war only if its payoﬀ from this
peaceful settlement would be larger than its expected payoﬀ from a default to war.8 Given
the working assumption that the whole of the territory is neither more not less valuable than
8

Powell (1993) considers the possibility of a peaceful settlement with a fortified border, but in this analysis

he takes the division of the contested territory as given, rather than as subject to negotiation as in the present
analysis. Powell (1999) considers the possibility of a negotiated division of the contested territory, but in
this analysis he takes each state’s prospects for success in war as given.

the sum of its parts, the value of permanently controlling the fraction ki of the contested
territory would be ki V, and the payoﬀ to State i from this peaceful settlement would be
ki V − Ri∗ . Accordingly, State i would prefer this peaceful settlement to a default to war
only if ki is large enough and Ri∗ is small enough that this peaceful settlement satisfies
ki V − Ri∗ > Ni ,

(5)

where, from equation (4), Ni equals V /4.
Given that k1 + k2 = 1, condition (5) is satisfied for both State 1 and State 2 if and
only if R1∗ , R2∗ , and k1 satisfy
1−

(6)

N2 + R2∗
N1 + R1∗

V
V

With both N1 and N2 and both R1 and R2 equal to V /4, there exists at least one
value of k1 that can satisfy condition (6) if and only if the sum, R1∗ + R2∗ , satisfies
R1∗ + R2∗ < V /2 = R1 + R2 .

(7)

Condition (7) says that there exists a division of the contested territory such that both
states would prefer a peaceful settlement to a default to war only if the total amount that
the two states would spend to construct fortifications under this peaceful settlement would
be smaller than total amount that the two states would spend to mobilize resources in the
event of a default to war.
The Expected Payoﬀ from Attacking
In a peaceful settlement each state promises not to attack in an attempt to gain control
of the entire contested territory. With R1∗ + R2∗ smaller than R1 + R2 , would such promises
be credibility? Given that the states choose their strategy sets to maximize their expected
payoﬀs, a promise by State i not to attack would be credible only if the expected payoﬀ for
State i from keeping its promise would at least as large as its expected payoﬀ from breaking
its promise and attacking.
7

Let Ñi denote the expected payoﬀ to State i from breaking its promise not to attack.
Given that the winner of a war would get permanent control of the contested territory, and
that State i already has spent Ri∗ to fortify the border, we have
Ñi = p̃i V − (Ri∗ + R̃i ),

(8)

where p̃i , p̃i ∈ [0, 1], denotes the probability that, if State i attacks, it would win the
resulting war, and where R̃i , R̃i ∈ (0, V ), denotes the amount that State i would spend to
mobilize resources for an attack.
Let Rj∗∗ , Rj∗∗ ∈ (0, V ), denote the amount that, if State i were to attack, State j would
spend to mobilize resources for a counterattack. In this formulation resources mobilized for
a counterattack diﬀer from fortifications in that states decide to mobilize resources for a
counterattack only in response to an attack. In other words, State j would choose Rj∗∗ as
a reaction to R̃i , whereas State j spends Rj∗ to fortify the border before State i chooses
whether or not to attack.
To determine the probability that, if State i attacks, it would win the resulting war,
assume that p̃i depends on R̃i , Rj∗ , and Rj∗∗ according to the contest-success function,
(9)

p̃i =

θR̃i
,
θR̃i + φRj∗ + γRj∗∗

θ ∈ [0, ∞),

φ ∈ [0, θ),

γ ∈ [0, θ).

In equation (9) the parameter θ measures the eﬀectiveness of amounts spent to mobilize
resources for an attack, the parameter φ measures the eﬀectiveness of amounts spent
to construct fortifications, and the parameter γ measures the eﬀectiveness of amounts
spent to mobilize resources for a counterattack. The specification that φ is smaller than θ
formalizes the assumption that attacking has an advantage over defending. The specification
that γ is smaller than θ formalizes the assumption that attacking has an advantage over
counterattacking. In accord with our working assumption that the states have the same
eﬀectiveness of amounts spent to mobilize resources, equation (9) assumes that θ, φ, and
γ are the same for both states.
8

Given that both γ and φ are smaller than θ, each state would agree to a peaceful
settlement only if the other state’s promise not to attack is credible. Specifically, State j
would have a larger expected payoﬀ from a default to war than it would have if it were to
agree to a peaceful settlement and State i were to break its promise not to attack.
If State i were to attack, then to maximize its expected payoﬀ from attacking, taking
as given the strength of the fortifications and counterattacks with which it would have to
contend, State i would choose R̃i to satisfy the following first-order condition:
Either

dÑi
= 0 and R̃i > 0,
dR̃i

dÑi
≤ 0 and R̃i = 0,

function,

θV (φRj∗ + γRj∗∗ ) − (φRj∗ + γRj∗∗ ), 0 .

If State i were to attack, how much would State j spend to mobilize resources for a
counterattack? Let Nj∗ denote the expected payoﬀ to State j if State i were to attack.
Given, again, that the winner of a war would get permanent control of the entire contested
territory, we have
Nj∗ = (1 − p̃i )V − (Rj∗ + Rj∗∗ ).

(11)

If State i were to attack, then State j to maximize its expected payoﬀ from a counterattack, having already spent Rj∗ to fortify the border, and taking R̃i as given, would choose
Rj∗∗ to satisfy the following first-order condition:
Either

dNj∗
= 0 and Rj∗∗ > 0,

Credibility Conditions
Recalling that the payoﬀ to State i from a peaceful settlement would be ki V − Ri∗ , the
promise of State i not to attack would be credible only if ki and Rj∗ taken together are
large enough to satisfy the credibility condition, ki V − Ri∗ ≥ Ñi . Equivalently we can
express this credibility condition as
(16)

ki ≥ Zi ,

where
10

Zi ≡

Ñi + Ri∗
.
V

If condition (16) is satisfied, then for State i the payoﬀ from a peaceful settlement is at least
as large as the expected payoﬀ from attacking. In other words, if condition (16) is satisfied,
then for State i the possibility of gaining kj V if it attacks and then wins the resulting war
does not outweigh the cost of mobilizing resources for an attack together with the possibility
of losing ki V if it attacks and does not win the resulting war.
Given that k1 + k2 = 1, condition (16) is satisfied both for State 1 and for State 2 if
and only if k1 satisfies
1 − Z2 ≥ k1 ≥ Z1 .

(17)

There exists at least one value of k1 that satisfies condition (17) if and only if the sum,
Z1 + Z2 , is not larger than one.
An Unfortified Border?
Suppose that the states are considering a peaceful settlement with an unfortified border.
With both R1∗ and R2∗ equal to zero, equation (15) and the definition of Zi imply that
h

i2

both Z1 and Z2 equal θ/(θ + γ) . Hence, both R1∗ and R2∗ equal to zero is consistent
with Z1 + Z2 being not larger than one if and only if the ratio of the parameters γ and
θ satisfies
(18)

√
γ
≥ 2 − 1.
θ

Condition (18) implies the following proposition:
(I) If amounts spent to mobilize resources for a counterattack would be suﬃciently
eﬀective relative to amounts spent to mobilize resources for an attack, then the
states can reach a credible peaceful settlement with an unfortified border.9,10
9

Even if condition (18) is satisfied, a peaceful settlement with an unfortified border is not a unique (Nash)

equilibrium. But, if condition (18) is satisfied, then we can presume that the promises of both states not to
attack serve to allow the states to coordinate on this equilibrium.
10

The model developed in Grossman (2004) and applied to the American Civil War abstracts from the

A Peaceful Settlement with a Fortified Border?
Suppose that the ratio γ/θ does not satisfy condition (18). In that case we see from
equation (15) and the definition of Zi that, in addition to not being consistent with both
R1∗ and R2∗ equal to zero, the sum, Z1 + Z2 , being not larger than one would not be
h

i2

consistent with both φR1∗ and φR2∗ being smaller than θV γ/(θ + γ) . Accordingly, the
states would be limited to considering peaceful settlements with both φR1∗ and φR2∗ not

smaller than θV γ/(θ + γ) .

Recall that for both states the payoﬀ from a peaceful settlement would be larger than the

which equals V /2. For R1∗ + R2∗ , as implied by equation (20), to be smaller than V /2,

Condition (21) implies the following proposition:
distinction between attacking and counterattacking. Hence, that model implicitly assumes that γ equals θ,
and, accordingly, that the analog of condition (18) is satisfied. That model focuses on overoptimism about
the prospects of winning a war cheaply as a necessary part of an explanation for the choice to go to war.

(II) If a peaceful settlement with an unfortified border would not be credible, but
if amounts spent to construct fortifications would be suﬃciently eﬀective relative
to amounts spent to mobilize resources for an attack, then the states can reach
a peaceful settlement with a fortified border that is credible and preferable to a
default to war.
In addition, equation (20) implies that in such a peaceful settlement the amount that each
state would have to spend to construct fortifications would be a decreasing function of φ/θ.
Figure 1 depicts the derivation of this result.
According to Proposition (I) the possibility of a credible peaceful settlement with an
unfortified border depends on the relative eﬀectiveness of amounts spent to mobilize resources
for a counterattack, whereas according to Proposition (II) the possibility of a credible peaceful settlement with a fortified border depends on the relative eﬀectiveness of amounts spent to
construct fortifications. The converse of Propositions (I) and (II) is also worth emphasizing.
(III) If both amounts spent to mobilize resources for a counterattack and amounts
spent to construct fortifications would be ineﬀective relative to amounts spent to
mobilize resources for an attack, then the states cannot reach a credible peaceful
settlement, with the resulting border either unfortified or fortified, that would be
preferable to a default to war.
Figure 2 depicts conditions (18) and (21) and Propositions (I), (II), and (III).
Divisibility
We now turn to relaxing our working assumptions, beginning with the assumption that
the whole of the territory is neither more nor less valuable than the sum of its parts. To
be more general, assume that the value of permanently controlling the fraction ki of the
1/σ

contested territory would be ki V, where σ ∈ (0, 1]. The parameter, σ, calibrates the
divisibility of the territory.

If σ equals one, as implicitly we have been assuming, the value of controlling the fraction
ki of the territory would be exactly equal to ki times the value of controlling the entire
territory. In this case dividing the territory would be costless.
In contrast, if σ is smaller than one, then the value of controlling the fraction ki of
the territory would be smaller than ki times the value of controlling the entire territory. In
this case the whole of the territory is more valuable than the sum of its parts, and dividing
the territory would be costly.11
Given that the winner of a war would gain permanent control of the contested territory,
the expected payoﬀs to a default to war and to breaking a promise not to attack do not
depend on σ. But, as σ becomes smaller than one, the payoﬀ to any peaceful settlement
that divides control of the contested territory becomes smaller.12
To analyze the eﬀect of costly divisibility, begin by replacing ki in condition (5) with
1/σ

ki . With this generalization condition (6) becomes

As σ approaches zero, the territory becomes indivisible. An example would be a territory that either

one of the states perceives, for either geopolitical or symbolic reasons, to be essential for its survival.
12

If side payments in the form of monetary or other compensation are possible, then the states could

reach a peaceful settlement that avoids a costly division of a contested territory. Fearon (1995) argues
that side payments “typically” are feasible. Hence, he claims that costly divisibility does not provide a
“compelling” reason for failure to settle territorial disputes peacefully. Other scholars, however, claim that
in fact indivisibility often prevents peaceful settlements. See, for example, Monica Duﬀy Toft (2003).

implies that, if σ were equal to or smaller than one half, then, because the winner of a
war would control the entire contested territory, the payoﬀ from a peaceful settlement, even
with the resulting border unfortified, could not be larger for both states than the expected
payoﬀ from a default to war. Thus, we have the following extension of Proposition (III):

the sum of its parts, then the states cannot reach a peaceful settlement, with the
resulting border either unfortified or fortified, that would be preferable to a default

A Recurring Possibility of War
So far we have assumed that a war would settle the territorial dispute permanently. To
relax this assumption, assume that a state that wins a war would gain control of the contested
territory only for a single finite period, where a period is the amount of time, measured in
standard units of time, such as years, that it would take for the states to rearm and prepare
for a new war. Under this assumption the states face a recurring possibility of war.
Let v, v ∈ (0, ∞), denote the value of having control of the entire contested territory for
a single period. Assuming that v does not vary over time, the present value, V, of having
permanent control of the entire contested territory equals v/(1 − ρ), where ρ, ρ ∈ [0, 1),
is the discount factor that corresponds to the length of a period. Given V, the shorter is a
period, the smaller is v, and the larger is ρ. Specifically, if q, q ∈ [0, 1), is the discount
factor applicable to a periodicity of one year, and if it would take m years to rearm and
prepare for a new war, then ρ equals q m . The working assumption that a war would settle
the territorial dispute permanently corresponds to the limiting case of v equal to V, and
ρ equal to zero.
To focus on the eﬀects of a recurring possibility of war, abstract from the ability to
counterattack by assuming that γ equals zero. Condition (18) implies that, under the
assumption that the winner of a war would get permanent control of the contested territory,
a credible peaceful settlement with an unfortified border would not be possible with γ equal
to zero. Also, abstract from the problem of costly divisibility by again assuming that σ
equals one. Condition (21) implies that, with σ equal to one, a peaceful settlement with
a fortified border that is credible and preferable to a default to war requires that φ/θ be
³
√ ´2
larger than 2 − 2 .

Assuming that, in the event of a default to recurring war, the expected payoﬀ for State

i from each recurring war would be pi v − Ri , equation (1) becomes
(1ρ)

Ni =

pi v − Ri
Ri
= pi V −
,
1−ρ
1−ρ
17

where Ni now denotes the expected payoﬀ for State i from a default to recurring war.
Given equation (1ρ), equations (4) become
(4ρ)

R1 = R2 = v/4 = (1 − ρ)V /4

and

N1 = N2 =

v/4
= V /4.
1−ρ

Comparing equations (4ρ) with equations (4) we see that, given V, because the amounts that
the states would spend to mobilize resources in the event of a default to war are proportionate
to v, the expected payoﬀ from a default to war does not depend on whether or not war
would be recurring.
As in the standard theory of repeated games, assume that, with states facing a recurring
possibility of war, as long as both states keep their promises not to attack, they can continue
to make credible promises not to attack. But, if either state were to break its promise not
to attack, then future peaceful settlements would be precluded. In that event, starting in
the next period, the states would have to bear the costs of a recurring default to war.13
Under these assumptions the expected payoﬀ to State i from breaking its promise not to
attack becomes
(8ρ)

Ñi = p̃i v − (Ri∗ + R̃i ) + ρV /4 = p̃i (1 − ρ)V − (Ri∗ + R̃i ) + ρV /4,

Equation (8ρ) amends equation (8) in accord with the assumption that a state that attacks
and wins a war would gain control of the entire contested territory for the current period,
but would expect to obtain in future periods only the expected value of a default to recurring
war. Given equation (8ρ), and assuming that γ equals zero, equation (15) becomes

φRj∗ ≤ (1 − ρ)θV

for

φRj∗ > (1 − ρ)θV,

These assumptions accord with the Garfinkel’s (1990) analysis of the possibility of armed peace. In

Garfinkel’s model states contest control over capital stocks that are endogenously determined. The present
analysis is simplified by taking the value of controlling the contested territory to be exogenous.

18

Again the credibility condition is ki ≥ Zi , where Zi ≡ (Ñi + Ri∗ )/V, and again there exists
at least one value of k1 that satisfies these credibility conditions if and only if the sum,
Z1 + Z2 , is not larger than one.
Consider again the possibility of a peaceful settlement with an unfortified border. Given
equation (15ρ) and the definition of Zi , both R1∗ and R2∗ equal to zero is consistent with
Z1 + Z2 being not larger than one if and only if the discount factor, ρ, satisfies
ρ ≥ 2/3.

(18ρ)

To interpret condition (18ρ), observe that if, for example, the annual discount factor equals
about 9/10, then, because 2/3 equals approximately (9/10)4 , a value of ρ equal to or larger
than 2/3 corresponds to a potential recurrence of war more frequently than approximately
every four years.
Condition (18ρ) implies the following extension of Proposition (I).
(Iρ) If war could recur with suﬃcient frequency, then the states can reach a
credible peaceful settlement with an unfortified border, regardless of the relative
eﬀectiveness of amounts spent to mobilize resources for a counterattack.
Suppose that ρ does not satisfy condition (18ρ). In that case, with γ equal to zero, the
states would be limited to considering the possibility of a peaceful settlement with a fortified
border. For positive values of R1∗ and R2∗ equation (19) becomes

Solving the quadratic equation obtained by setting Z1 + Z2 equal to one, we find that

For R1∗ + R2∗ , as implied by equation (20ρ), to be smaller than V /2, the parameters φ,
θ, and ρ must satisfy

Condition (21ρ) implies that a peaceful settlement with a fortified border that is credible

and preferable to a default to war is possible even if φ/θ is smaller than 2 − 2 . Thus,

condition (21ρ) implies the following extension of Proposition (II):

(IIρ) If a peaceful settlement with an unfortified border would not be credible,
but war could recur with suﬃcient frequency, then the states can reach a peaceful
settlement with a fortified border that is credible and preferable to a default to
war, even if amounts spent to construct fortifications would not be highly eﬀective
relative to amounts spent to mobilize resources for an attack.
In addition, equation (20ρ) implies that in such a peaceful settlement the amount that each
state would have to spend to construct fortifications would be a decreasing function of ρ.
Figure 5 depicts conditions (18ρ) and (21ρ) and Propositions (Iρ) and (IIρ). Both of
these propositions are applications of standard results from the theory of repeated games.
Depreciation and Obsolescence
We now turn to the working assumption that fortifications neither depreciate nor become
obsolete. To relax this assumption, assume that fortifications must be rebuilt periodically,
where a period now is the useful lifetime of fortifications, measured in standard units of
time, such as years. Accordingly, the present value of the cost of maintaining a fortification
that entailed an initial expenditure of Ri∗ would be Ri∗ /(1 − δ), where δ, δ ∈ [0, 1),
is the discount factor that corresponds to the periodicity with which fortifications must be

rebuilt. The shorter is a period the larger is δ. Specifically, if q is the discount factor
applicable to a periodicity of one year, and if fortifications must be rebuilt every n years,
then δ equals q n . The working assumption that fortifications neither depreciate nor become
obsolete corresponds to the limiting case of δ equal to zero.
To focus on the eﬀects of depreciation and obsolescence, abstract from the problem of
costly divisibility by again assuming that σ equals one. Also, assume again that the winner
of a war would get permanent control of the contested territory.
With fortifications having to be rebuilt periodically, the payoﬀ for State i from a peaceful
settlement that required an initial expenditure of Ri∗ on fortifications would be ki V −
Ri∗ /(1 − δ). Hence, condition (5) becomes
ki V − Ri∗ /(1 − δ) > Ni ,

Condition (7δ) says that both states would prefer a peaceful settlement to a default to war
only if the present value of the cost for the two states of constructing and maintaining
fortifications under a peaceful settlement would be smaller than total amount that the two
states would spend to mobilize resources in the event of a default to war.
Would a peaceful settlement with (R1∗ + R2∗ )/(1 − δ) smaller than R1 + R2 be credible?
To answer this question observe that with the payoﬀ from a peaceful settlement equal to
ki V − Ri∗ /(1 − δ), and with Ñi again given by equation (15), equation (16) becomes

ki ≥ Zi ,

Again, there exists at least one value of k1 that satisfies condition (17), 1−Z2 ≥ k1 ≥ Z1 ,
if and only if the sum, Z1 + Z2 , is not larger than one.
Depreciation and obsolescence of fortifications obviously do not aﬀect the possibility of a
credible peaceful settlement with an unfortified border. Hence, both R1∗ and R2∗ equal to
zero is consistent with Z1 + Z2 being not larger than one if and only if again γ/θ satisfies

Suppose that γ/θ does not satisfy condition (18). In that case, the states again would

Equation (20δ) implies that there exist values of R1∗ and R2∗ that would satisfy the

implies the following extension of Proposition (III):
(IIIδ) If fortifications depreciate or become obsolete suﬃciently rapidly, then the
states cannot reach a peaceful settlement with a fortified border that would be
credible and preferable to a default to war.14
14

The logic of this proposition is similar to the logic of the example in Garfinkel and Stergios Skaperdas

22

If δ/(1 − δ) is not larger than φ/θ, then for the sum of R1∗ and R2∗ implied by
equation (20δ) to satisfy condition (7δ), the parameters φ, θ, and δ must satisfy

The LHS of condition (21δ) is decreasing in δ and increasing in φ/θ, whereas the RHS
of condition (21δ) is increasing in δ and decreasing in φ/θ. Thus, condition (21δ) implies
that, even if δ/(1 − δ) is not larger than φ/θ, the larger is δ the larger must be φ/θ in
order for a peaceful settlement with a fortified border to be possible. Thus, condition (21δ)
implies the following extension of Proposition (II):
(IIδ) If fortifications do not either depreciate or become obsolete too rapidly, and
if amounts spent to construct fortifications would be suﬃciently eﬀective relative
to amounts spent to mobilize resources for an attack, then the states can reach
a peaceful settlement with a fortified border that is credible and preferable to a
default to war.
Equation (20δ) also implies that in such a peaceful settlement the amount that each state
would have to spend on fortifications would be an increasing function of δ.
Figure 6 depicts condition (21δ) and Proposition (IIδ).

In interpreting Figure 6, ob-

serve that, if the annual discount factor equals about 9/10, then, because 7/16 equals
approximately (9/10)8 , a value of δ smaller than 7/16 corresponds to a need to rebuild
fortifications less frequently than approximately every eight years.
Unequal Eﬀectiveness of Amounts Spent to Mobilize Resources
Finally we come to the working assumption that the two states have the same eﬀectiveness
of amounts spent to mobilize resources. To relax this assumption, let θi measure the
(2000) in which a war that would settle a dispute permanently can be preferable to an armed peace in which
fortifications must be rebuilt periodically.

to mobilize resources for a counterattack, where γi and γj can be unequal.
Consider again the possibility of a peaceful settlement with an unfortified border. If θi

Using equations (2u) and (9u) in place of equations (2) and (9), and assuming again that

extension of Proposition (I):

(Iu) Unequal eﬀectiveness of amounts spent to mobilize resources can preclude a
peaceful settlement that would be credible if the two states had equal eﬀectiveness
of amounts spent to mobilize resources.
Figure (7) illustrates Proposition (Iu). This proposition follows from the nonlinearity of the
contest-success functions.
Summary
This paper has analyzed a choice-theoretic model in which a territorial dispute between
sovereign states can aﬀord either a peaceful settlement with an unfortified border, or, if not,
perhaps a peaceful settlement with a fortified border, or possibly only a default to war. The
essential premise of the model is that states can settle a dispute peacefully only if their
payoﬀs from a peaceful settlement are larger than their expected payoﬀs from a default to
war, and their promises not to attack are credible. The model assumes that all parameters
are common knowledge, thereby abstracting from incomplete information as a cause of war.
The following are the main results of our analysis:
• A large advantage of attacking over counterattacking precludes a peaceful settlement
with an unfortified border.
• A large advantage of attacking over defending precludes a peaceful settlement with a
fortified border.
• A high cost of dividing the contested territory precludes a peaceful settlement with
the border either unfortified or fortified.
• The possibility of recurring war enhances the possibility of a peaceful settlement with
the border either unfortified or fortified.
• Rapid depreciation or obsolescence of fortifications precludes a peaceful settlement
with a fortified border.
• Unequal eﬀectiveness of amounts spent to mobilize resources can preclude a peaceful
settlement with the border either unfortified or fortified.
