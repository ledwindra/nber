Why Work More? The Impact of Taxes, and Culture of Leisure on Labor Supply in Europe

ABSTRACT
We use micro data from the European Social Survey to investigate the impact of “culture of leisure”
and taxes on labor force participation and hours worked of second-generation immigrants who reside
in 26 European countries. These individuals are born in Europe, and they have been exposed to institutional,
legal and labor market structures of their countries, including the tax rates. Fathers of these individuals
are first-generation immigrants who migrated from 81 different countries. We construct measures
of “taste for leisure” in the country of origin of each immigrant father. We employ average and marginal
taxes for each country of residence, and control for a large set of individual characteristics, in addition
to attributes of the country of residence and country of ancestry. The results show that for women,
both taxes and culture of leisure impact participation and hours worked. For men, taxes influence labor
supply both at the intensive and the extensive margins, but culture of leisure has no impact.

Why Work More?
The Impact of Taxes, and Culture of Leisure on Labor Supply in Europe

I. Introduction
There are substantial differences between people around the world regarding how many
hours they work in the labor market. For example, in 2012, the average annual hours worked
by American workers was 1,750. The average worker in Germany worked 17 percent fewer
hours than an American worker in that year, and a French worker worked 15 percent less. A
worker in Belgium spent about 9 percent less time at work in comparison to an American
worker. Similar disparities are observed when hours per person is analyzed, instead of hours
per worker.1 Annual hours worked per working age population (ages 15 to 64) are 10
percent lower in Germany, 19% lower in France, and 17 percent lower in Belgium than in the
U.S.
In an influential paper, Edward Prescott (2004) employed a growth model with a
representative household and calibrated the model to show that the difference in hours
worked between the United States and Europe in two points in time can be explained almost
entirely by the differences in the tax rates on labor and consumption. A large literature that
followed provided a number of nuanced extensions and modifications to Prescott‟s
framework, regarding the preferred labor supply elasticities to calibrate such macro models,
modifications to the model to incorporate the ability for the household to self-insure through
asset accumulation, the role of productivity growth, and so on (e.g. Ljungqvist and Sargent
2006, Ohanian et al. 2008, Rogerson 2008, Olovsson 2009, Chetty et al. 2011, McDaniel

This measure incorporates both the willingness to participate in the labor market (the decision on
whether or not to work) and the decision on how many hours to work.

2011). In a different framework, Algan and Cahuc (2005) showed that family labor supply
attitudes were important in explaining the variation in the employment rates of different
demographic groups in OECD countries.
The finding that taxes are a major factor in explaining cross-country differences in
market work is important because it implies that reductions in taxes can generate significant
increases in economic activity. Alternative, or at least complementary, hypotheses have been
proposed to explain the differences in hours worked between Europe and the U.S. These
include the importance of regulations and labor unions (Alesina, Glaeser and Sacerdote
2006), and the role of home production (Olovsson 2015). An important aspect of this
discussion, and the key component of our paper, is the role of preferences for leisure. The
assumption of identical preferences between countries, and in particular between Europeans
and Americans has been questioned (Blanchard 2006). This point is also emphasized by
Alesina, Glaeser and Sacerdote (2006) who suggested that an initial decline in market work
might increase individuals‟ utility from leisure and this process can be amplified by a social
multiplier (Glaeser, Sacerdote and Scheinkman 2003) if there exist complementarities in
leisure – individuals‟ utility from leisure is enhanced when more people are consuming
leisure.
The argument that Europeans have stronger taste for leisure than Americans (Blanchard
2004) is perhaps intuitive, and fits well with many people‟s pre-conceived image of longer
vacations and shorter work weeks in most European countries. That image was brought to
life in a Cadillac TV advertisement in the U.S., where the main character in the
advertisement, an American middle-age upper-income male, first asks the question: “Why do
we work so hard?” In answering his own question, he declares:

2

”[In] Other countries, they work, they stroll home, they stop by the café,
they take August off. Off! Why aren‟t you like that? Why aren‟t we like
that? Because we are crazy, driven, hard-working believers. That‟s why.
Those other countries think we are nuts. Whatever! “2

Although tastes for leisure can impact labor supply, no systematic analysis has been
conducted on this subject.3 In this paper, we focus on European countries and investigate the
impact of taxes and the culture of leisure on labor supply. Using a large micro data set
consisting of individuals from 26 European countries we analyze people‟s labor supply
decisions both at the extensive and the intensive margins.4 While there are significant
differences between Americans and Europeans in hours worked, there are also substantial
differences in market work between European countries. To demonstrate the extent of

Standard empirical models of labor supply include a vector of worker attributes including racial and
ethnic background, if available, in an effort to control for pre-market factors that can impact labor supply,
but explicit adjustment to taste for leisure has not been done so far.

4

The conjecture is that some countries have stronger preferences for leisure, and people in those countries
would have worked fewer hours even if they faced lower marginal tax rates. On the face of it, this
argument does not seem to explain the increasing wedge between labor supply of Americans and
Europeans over the last three decades or so, because culture is not expected to change rapidly. Even
though the goal of our paper is not to explain the divergence of hours worked between countries over
time, we should still emphasize that cultural attributes are malleable, and they change in reaction to
external factors. For example, Fernández (2013) shows that social attitudes towards women‟s work
endogenously change over time. Alesina and Fuchs-Schündeln (2007) find that individual preferences are
shaped by the political regime in which the individual lives. Giuliano and Spilimbergo (2014) show that
individuals‟ political preferences and support for government redistribution are impacted by whether or
not they grew up during recessionary periods. Giavazzi, Petkov and Schiantarelli (2014) show that while
some cultural values evolve slowly, others change rapidly. Cannonier and Mocan (2012) find that women
in Sierra Leone whose education is improved by an education reform are more likely to disapprove the
cultural practice of female genital mutilation. Mocan (2013) finds that the intensity of vengeful feelings
depends on the economic environment of the individual.

variation between countries in hours worked, we use OECD data and calculate hours worked
per population ages 15 to 64 in 2012, in a sample of European countries, which is displayed
in Table 1. This measure contains two dimensions of market work: the fraction of the
working age population that actually works and the number of hours of those who work. The
entries in Table 1 are standardized to portray average hours worked in each country relative
to the U.K. For example, hours worked per person in France, Germany and Greece are 19
percent, 10 percent, and 3 percent lower, respectively, than in the U.K. Swedes work 4
percent more than the working age population in the U.K. Importantly, as we will show later
in the paper, there is also substantial variation in the effective marginal tax rates between
European countries.
The critical issue for the purposes of our paper is how to measure the “taste for leisure,”
and how to identify its impact on market work. We focus on second-generation immigrants
who reside in various European countries. These individuals are born in Europe, and being
residents of different European countries, they have been exposed to institutional, legal and
labor market structures of their countries, including the marginal tax rates on labor and
consumption income. Their fathers had migrated from somewhere else in the world, and we
know these fathers‟ countries of origin. We use immigrant father‟s country of birth to
determine the ancestral roots, and assume that culture of leisure in father‟s country of origin
is transmitted from the immigrant father to the offspring. We focus on the father, rather than
the mother because most of the literature uses the birth place of the father to assign country
of origin to second-generation immigrants (Alesina et al. 2015, Alesina and Giuliano 2011,
Alesina and Giuliano 2010, Fernández and Fogli 2009, Card et al. 1998). By exploiting a
separate data set that asks people around the world various questions to gauge their taste for

4

leisure, we connect these second-generation immigrants in Europe to the culture of leisure in
their father‟s country of origin.
We have data from about 7,000 individuals who live and work in 26 European countries.
These individuals have ancestral origins in 81 different countries. Thus, we are able to
identify the impact of taxes in the country of residence on hours worked, holding constant
observable attributes of individuals, various attributes of the country in which they live, and
attributes of their father‟s country of origin, including the taste for leisure in that country of
origin. Similarly, we can identify the impact of culture of leisure on labor supply, holding
constant all personal attributes and various characteristics of the country of residence,
including the tax rates.
We find that both taxes and culture of leisure impact labor force participation and hours
worked for women. For men, taxes influence labor supply both at the intensive and the
extensive margin, but culture of leisure has no impact. The magnitude of the estimated
effects indicates that while taxes on labor income are a significant determinant of aggregate
hours worked, culture of leisure is important as well.
Our work is also related to a growing new literature that investigates the interplay
between culture and economic outcomes. Some recent examples include Fernández and
Fogli (2009) who investigate the impact of female labor force participation and fertility rates
in the country of origin on work and fertility decisions of second-generation American
women; Alesina and Giuliano (2011) who investigate the impact of family ties on political
participation, labor force participation and trust. Luttmer and Singhal (2011) report that
immigrants‟ redistributive preferences are impacted by the average preference in their
country of birth. Ljunge (2014) analyzes the transmission of trust to immigrant children.

5

Alesina et al. (2015) find that people who inherit strong family ties are less mobile and have
lower wages and higher unemployment. A detailed description of this literature can be found
in Alesina and Giuliano (2014) and Fernández (2011).

II. Theoretical Framework
To motivate the empirical model, we follow the framework of Prescott (2004) and
consider a representative agent who is endowed with one unit of time that can be divided
between labor and leisure. Preferences over consumption and leisure are represented by the
utility function in Equation (1):
1)

∑

where ct stands for consumption and ht represents hours worked; implying that (1-ht) is
the amount of leisure. The discount factor β represents the degree of patience, where
. The parameter γ is the value attached to leisure. The aggregate production
function of the economy is that of Cobb-Douglas type, with an output elasticity of capital θ,
and elasticity of labor (1-θ). The production function converts labor (ht in Equation 1) and
capital into output, which can be consumed or invested.

The budget constraint of the representative agent is:
2)
where τc is the consumption tax rate, τx is the tax rate on investment, and τh is the
marginal labor tax rate; rt stands for the rental price of capital and τk is the capital income tax
rate. Tt represents government transfers at time t that are financed by taxes. wt is the price of
labor, therefore (wtht) represents labor income.
6

The standard first-order conditions indicate that the marginal rate of substitution between
leisure and consumption is equal to the ratio of their prices, and that labor is paid its marginal
product. The first-order conditions imply
{

(3)

}

where τ= (τh +τc)/(1+τc), which is the effective marginal tax rate on labor income. It
represents the combined labor and consumption taxes exerted on labor income, holding
investment constant. Equation (3) depicts the supply of hours worked. Because the effective
marginal tax rate on labor income, τ, is embedded in one of the first-order conditions, it is
also in equation (3): an increase in the tax rate τ reduces labor supply ht.
Much attention has been devoted to the investigation of the impact of taxes on hours
worked at a cross-section of countries, or by using the variation in the tax rates of countries
over a period of time. On the other hand, the impact of marginal utility of leisure on hours
worked (which is depicted by γ in Equation 3), has not been investigated, despite the fact that
it has been postulated to be a potentially important factor to explain cross-country differences
in labor supply. An increase in γ has a negative impact on hours worked. As we describe in
the next section, we develop measures of γ to represent the value of leisure that can vary
between countries.
Equation (3) provides a framework in which labor supply depends on taxes and tastes
for leisure. We will not estimate the specific structural parameters, based on the specific
form depicted by Equation (3). Rather, as shown below, we will estimate a linear
formulation of labor supply, which depends on personal attributes of individuals, country
characteristics including taxes, and measures of taste for leisure.

7

Although we use survey data on individuals from various years, there is no substantial
variation in marginal taxes over the years in a country. Thus, our elasticity estimates can be
interpreted as steady-state elasticities. As we explain in the next section, we estimate
elasticities both at the extensive and intensive margins.

III. Empirical Implementation
Consistent with the theoretical framework described in the previous section, we estimate
the following specification to investigate the impact of taxes and taste for leisure on labor
supply:
(4)

hijnt = β0 + β1 τj + β2Ln+ XiΦ + Cj Ω + COn Ψ + δt + εijnt,

where hijnt stands for the labor supply of person i who is a second-generation immigrant,
living in country j, surveyed at time t. Labor supply is measured both at the extensive and
intensive margins, allowing us to estimate models for labor force participation and for hours
worked, conditional on participation. The subscript n represents the country-of-origin of this
person‟s father (who migrated from country n to country j). The vector Xi includes personal
attributes of individual i that may impact his/her labor supply decision such as age,
completed years of education, marital status, whether the person perceives him/herself as an
ethnic minority in that country, and the size of the city of residence. The vector Cj controls
for the attributes of the country of residence that may influence labor supply through their
impact on aggregate labor productivity, institutional factors and so on. The vector Cj
includes GDP per capita, average educational attainment in the country, the extent of the
individualistic culture in the country, index of ethno-linguistic fragmentation, size of the
population, legal origin indicators, and number of years in which country experienced

8

democracy between 1930 and 1995. COn contains attributes of the country of ancestry, such
as the index of ethno-linguistic fragmentation, legal origin indicators, and a measure of
democracy in father‟s country of origin. Time fixed-effects, δt, account for the year in which
individuals are surveyed. Standard errors are clustered at the country of origin.
The variable τ measures the effective marginal tax rate on labor income in country j
where person i resides and works. We follow closely the literature, and as detailed in the
next section, use country-specific tax rates generated by the previous research (Prescott 2004,
McDaniel 2011). Although we use surveys of individuals from different years, the two
measures of taxes we employ (the effective marginal tax rate, as well as the average tax rate
for a single person without a dependent) do not change appreciably within a country in the
sample period. Thus, the impact of taxes on labor supply is identified from cross-country
variation in tax rates.
Ln stands for various measures of the culture of leisure in the country of origin,
constructed by using data from the World Values Survey and the European Values Study.
For example, one particular question in these surveys is: “How important is leisure in your
life?” Possible answers range from 1 (not important) to 4 (very important). The average
value of answers to this question was 3.5 in Sweden, 3.3 in Uruguay, 2.9 in Morocco, and 2.6
in China, suggesting that people in Sweden value leisure more strongly in comparison to
those who live in Morocco or in China, for example. Other examples of indicators for culture
of leisure are responses to such statements as “People who don’t work turn lazy” (agreedisagree on a scale from 1 to 5) and “Work is a duty to society” (agree-disagree from 1 to 5).
The details of these and other measures of culture of leisure in the country of origin are
explained in the data section.

9

The framework shown in Equation (4) is termed an “epidemiological” approach by
Fernández (2008, 2007) because it aims to identify the impact of inherited, pre-existing
factors on behavior, holding constant the context in which the decision takes place. Note that
reverse causality from labor supply to “taste for leisure” is unlikely to be an issue here
because the labor supply decision of the individual cannot have an impact on the extent of the
taste for leisure in father‟s country of origin. Similarly, an individual‟s labor supply is not
expected to have an immediate impact on the tax rate in her country of residence. Even if the
government wanted to react to a variation in aggregate hours worked in the economy by
altering the tax rates, it cannot do so quickly, because it is well known that the inside-lags are
substantial in case of fiscal policy. In other words, changes in taxes necessitate negotiations
both in the parliament and with different constituents including labor unions. Because of the
lags in legislative implementation, it is implausible that tax rates would react
contemporaneously to a change in the aggregate hours worked in the economy. Neither the
tax rates nor aggregate labor supply vary significantly within a country from year to year.
For example, in Germany average hours worked per working-age population were 1,065 in
2008, 1,057 in 2010, and 1,067 in 2012. We display the aggregate hours worked and the
effective marginal tax rate for France, Germany, the U.K. and Belgium from the OECD data
over the period of 2000-2012 in Table 2.5 There is no systematic change in hours worked or
in the tax rate in these countries over the course of these 13 years. When we calculate the
year-to-year change in average hours worked and in the effective marginal tax rate over the
same period for the 26 European countries used in the analysis, we find that the average

section.
10

annual growth rate is essentially zero for both hours worked and taxes (the average growth
rate is -0.002 in case of annual hours and 0.0002 in case of taxes).
It could be possible, however, that both country-level taxes and individual labor
supply are driven by certain socio-economic and cultural attributes of the country. For
example, societies can be rated on a scale ranging from “individualistic” to “collectivist”
using the index of individualism, developed by Hofstede (2001) and Hofstede (2005).6 Lower
values indicate the higher extent of collectivism of the society, which stands for the extent to
which individuals are integrated into groups. In collectivist societies, people from birth
onwards are integrated into strong, cohesive in-groups, often extended families (with uncles,
aunts and grandparents) which continue protecting them in exchange for unquestioning
loyalty. Higher values of the index represent individualistic societies where the ties between
individuals are loose, and where people are expected to look after themselves and their
immediate family. 7 There is substantial variation around the world in the extent to which
countries are individualistic or collectivist. For example Australia is rated a highly
individualistic country with a score of 90 (out of 100), and the most collectivist societies are
Colombia with a score of 13, Indonesia with a score of 14 and Costa Rica with a score of 15.
It could be the case that the extent of individualism in the country may be correlated with the
peoples‟ desired level of government regulation and tax rates, as well as with the extent of
the labor supply. We control for individualism in the country to account for such an effect.
Similarly, we control for other potential factors that may impact both taxes and labor
supply. They include per capita income in the country, the size of the population, the extent

11

of ethno-linguistic fragmentation in the country, as well as the extent of democracy. We also
control for the legal origin of the country. These indicators account for whether the country‟s
legal origin is British common law, French commercial code, socialist or communist law,
German commercial law or Scandinavian commercial law. These variables are explained in
the descriptive statistics Table 4.
First-generation immigrants are a self-selected group of people who chose to leave
their country-of-origin and decided to migrate to another country. Thus, their unobserved
attributes, including the propensity to work, may be different from the general population.
This issue, however, is not relevant for second-generation immigrants who are born in the
country of residence. Although these individuals have inherited the genetic attributes of their
immigrant parents, including perhaps an attitude towards work, this is not expected to create
a bias in our estimated coefficients unless one is prepared to argue that different countries of
origin have identical distributions of taste for leisure but that first-generation immigrants
from different countries are selected from different parts of this distribution.8 Note also that
cultural assimilation of the second-generation immigrants would make it difficult to identify
a statistically significant impact of culture of leisure on labor supply, even if it existed.
We also estimate alternative versions of Equation (4) as shown below.
(5)

hijnt = α0 + α1 τj + XiΘ + Cj Ξ + ξt +μn+ νijnt,

(6)

hijnt = λ0 + λ1Ln+ XiΛ + COn Γ + θt +ωj+ uijnt,

In equation (5) we replace all country-of-origin variables by country-of-origin fixedeffects (μn). This specification does not contain measures of culture of leisure, but it still
includes country-of-residence attributes as well as the tax rate in the country of origin.

8

See Fernández (2011) for more on this point.
12

Analogously, in Equation (6), the country-of residence variables, including the tax rate, are
replaced by country-of-residence fixed-effects (ωj), whereas variables measuring country-oforigin attributes, including proxies for culture of leisure, are retained. Equation (5) allows us
to investigate the sensitivity of the tax impact when we control for country-of-origin
differences by a set of country-of-origin fixed effects. Equation (6) does the reverse: it
allows us to analyze the sensitivity of the culture-of-leisure coefficient when we control for
the attributes of the countries of residence by a set of country-of-residence fixed-effects.
IV. Data and Descriptive Statistics
The analyses are based on a number of different data sets. Data on labor supply and
personal attributes of individuals are from the European Social Survey (ESS). We use five
cross-sectional rounds of the ESS, conducted biennially between years 2004 and 2013. The
ESS covers 35 European countries that participated in at least one round of the survey. We
include in our analysis 26 countries for which the OECD tax data are available. The core
module of the ESS is administered in all rounds and contains information about respondents‟
socio-economic circumstances, including employment history and work-related variables.
Starting with the second round, the ESS asks its respondents the countries in which their
mother and father were born, in addition to asking about respondent‟s own country of birth.
Our sample consists of second-generation immigrants. These individuals were born in their
country of residence but their fathers have migrated from a different country.

Outcomes and Personal Attributes
The two outcome variables are labor force participation and hours of work for the
individual. The labor force participation variable takes the value of one if the individual

13

reported being engaged in any paid work in the last 7 days or has been unemployed and is
actively looking for a job. The second measure of labor supply measures the intensive
margin, where the outcome is hours normally worked in a week at the main job. This
information is obtained from individuals who are either working at the time of the interview
or have worked in the past. In the former case, hours worked pertains to hours at the current
job, while in the latter case, hours worked corresponds to the hours worked at the
respondents‟ last job. We know the year in which this last job was held and we limit our
sample to those who last worked in the year 2000 or later. The reason is twofold: first, the
OECD tax measure is only available after year 2000, and second, measurement error is likely
to increase as people have to recall their weekly work hours from further back in the past.
Table 4 presents the descriptive statistics of the sample used in the hours worked
equation. The descriptive statistics of the sample used in participation regressions are
provided in the Appendix Table 2. Although the samples in the labor force participation and
the hours regressions are different by design, their descriptive statistics are similar. The first
panel of Table 4 presents the summary statistics by dividing the sample by gender of the
worker, as well as by the availability of the tax measure. Average weekly hours worked is
about 36 for females and 43 for males. Average age is about 40 for both sexes and average
years of schooling is around 13.5.

Tax Measures
We employ two different tax measures. Our first tax measure comes from the OECD
Tax Database. It is the average personal income tax and the social security contribution rate
on gross labor income for a single person without a dependent. This tax measure is available

14

for 26 countries in the ESS for all years from 2000 to 2013. Our second tax measure is the
effective marginal tax rate on labor income (τ) as used by others (e.g. Prescott 2004,
McDaniel 2011). We use the average tax series updated by McDaniel (2014) to construct .9
This tax measure is not available for all 26 countries and for all years for which the OECD
average tax rate is available. In particular, Estonia, Iceland, Israel, Luxembourg, and Turkey
have missing data for all years. Thus, the regressions that use τ are based on smaller samples.
Table 3 displays the tax rates for countries in which the individuals in our sample reside. The
two measures are highly correlated with a correlation coefficient of 0.75. The tax variables
are merged with the individual-level data based on the year of work when the outcome is the
weekly hours normally worked, and based on the year of interview when the outcome is labor
force participation.

Measures of Culture of Leisure in the Country of Origin
To construct culture of leisure measures, we use data from the World Values Survey
(WVS) and the European Values Study (EVS). We employ the five cross-sectional waves of
the WVS (1981–1984, 1990–1993, 1995–1997, 1999–2004, and 2005-2009). The WVS
coverage starts with 22 countries in the 1981-1984 wave, and reaches 87 countries by the
time of the 2005-2009 wave. The WVS asks its respondents about their attitudes regarding a
variety of topics, including religion, political preferences, family values and work ethics.
The European Values Study (EVS) consists of four waves of cross-sectional surveys
conducted in 49 predominantly European countries (1981-1984, 1990-1993, 1999-2001, and
2008-2010). The formulation of EVS questions about attitudes to work and leisure is

15

identical to the WVS formulation. By pooling the WVS and the EVS, we are able cover a
large number of countries around the world to gauge the beliefs about the importance of
work and leisure in people‟s lives in these countries. When using WVS/EVS to measure
preferences towards leisure, we have excluded immigrants whenever information on
immigration status was available.
The descriptions of the variables and their sample means and standard deviations are
provided in Panel B of Table 4. We created five variables to measure the extent of culture of
leisure. Higher values of each variable represent a higher appreciation of leisure in that
country. The first variable “Leisure Important” is the average response in the country to the
question “Indicate how important leisure time is in your life.” Potential answers range from
1: Not at all important to 4: Very important. Table 4 shows that for individuals who enter the
hours of work regressions the average value of this variable is 3.1. Appendix Table 1
displays the average response to Leisure Important variable in each of the 81 countries that
represented the country-of-origin of the immigrant father. For example, the value of Leisure
Important is 2.60 in Albania.10 In comparison, the average value of Canada is 3.28,
indicating that Canadians attach a higher value to leisure than Albanians do.11
The second variable that gauges culture of leisure in a country is based on the
question of “Do you agree or disagree with the statement: People who don’t work turn lazy.”
Possible answers range from 1: Strongly agree to 5: Strongly disagree. A higher value
indicates a more tolerant attitude towards not working. The third and fourth variables in this
group are measured similarly, and they are based on answers to the following questions: “Do

EVS between 1994 and 2008.

you agree or disagree with the statement: Work is a duty toward society,” and “Do you agree
or disagree with the statement: Work should always come first, even if it means less spare
time.” A fifth variable is created to measure the extent of appreciation of leisure in a country
by calculating the proportion of people in the country who believe that provision of generous
holidays is an important aspect of a job.
Finally, we created two other measures that capture the extent of labor market
attachment in the country-of-origin. They are the labor force participation rates and average
weekly hours worked in father‟s country-of-origin. Labor force participation in the country
of ancestry has been used before as a cultural proxy for work (Fernádez and Fogli 2009,
Fernández and Fogli 2006). We calculate these variables by gender. This allows us to
conduct more nuanced analyses. For example, we can investigate how the labor supply
decision of a female second-generation immigrant in Europe is impacted by the intensity of
labor market activity of women in the country from which this person‟s father migrated.
Furthermore, we fine-tuned this measure to connect it to the relevant age groups using the
age bands of 15-24, 25-54 and 55-64.12
Similarly, we obtained weekly hours actually worked per employed person in the
country of origin. The data come from the International Labor Organization ILOSTAT
Database. Because the annual data are not available for every year and country, we use
averaged available values over the time period 2000 to 2013. The ILOSTAT indicator covers
both employees and self-employed and it counts hours people have worked either on all jobs,

For example, we connected the propensity to participate in the labor market of a female 2nd generation
immigrant in Europe who is 20 years old to the labor force participation rate of women ages 15-24 in her
father‟s country of origin. Country-age-and gender specific labor force participation rates were obtained
from the International Labor Organization ILOSTAT database. Because the annual data are not available
for every year, country, and age band, we use averaged available values over the time period 2002 to
2013.

or, in some country-years, at the main and second job only. Both part-time and full-time
employment hours are accounted for.13 Our measure of weekly hours in the country of origin
is gender-specific, but not age-group specific, as the ILOSTAT does not provide age groupspecific indicator.

Country Attributes
In each specification, we also control for country characteristics both in the country of
respondent‟s residence and in his/her father‟s country of origin. These variables include
ethno-linguistic fragmentation, the legal origin of the country, and the number of years in
which the country was democratic from 1930 to 1995. Additionally, the models include per
capita income, average country education, population size, and individualism index in the
country of residence.

V. Results
Table 5 displays the summary results for females. Panel A presents the coefficients
of tax and culture variables in the labor force participation equation, and Panel B presents the
estimated tax and culture coefficients from the hours equation for those who reported
positive work hours. All models include control variables pertaining to the individual,
country of ancestry and country of residence. These variables are listed in panels A, C, and
D of Table 4. The coefficients of these variables are not reported in the interest of space,

13

In addition, the ILOSTAT provides a number of flags indicating data inconsistencies that can
complicate analysis across time and countries. For example, in China, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Egypt,
Pakistan, Panama, Viet Nam, and Zimbabwe only full-time employment hours are counted, and we
exclude these countries from our sample.
18

although in Appendix Table 3 we display the full set of coefficients of the model in column
(1) of Panel A in Table 5.
Table 5 presents six specifications in six columns. Each specification includes a
different culture of leisure construct, which is displayed at the column header. For example,
in model of column (1) culture of leisure is measured by the mean value of the question that
gauges the importance of leisure in people‟s lives (Leisure Important). Similarly, in column
(2) culture of leisure is measured by responses to the statement of “People who don’t work
turn lazy” in the country of origin. Higher values of culture variables in columns (1) to (5)
indicate stronger preference for leisure. Thus, the estimated coefficient of culture of leisure in
these columns is expected to be negative. In column (6), culture is measured by the labor
force participation rate in the country of origin when we estimate models on the extensive
margin (Panel A), or as the average hours worked in the country of origin when we estimate
models on the intensive margin (Panel B). The coefficients of these variables are expected to
be positive to the extent that work effort in the country of ancestry is a cultural attribute
transmitted to the offspring.
Both Panels A and B of Table 5 have two sections. The models in the top section of
each panel use the first tax measure (average tax), while the models in the bottom section
employ τ (effective marginal tax) as the measure of the tax rate in the country. Panel A of
Table 5 shows that taxes have a negative impact on female labor force participation in all
models when taxes are measured by the average tax. The same is true also in models where
taxes are measured by the effective marginal tax rate τ, although the point estimates are
significant only at the 12-15 percent level in models of columns (1) to (4).

19

Culture of leisure in the country of origin has a negative and statistically significant
impact on female labor force participation in models displayed in columns (1) and (5) where
culture is measured by people‟s valuation of leisure (leisure is important) and by valuation of
the generous holidays attached to a job; In the regression reported in column (6), culture of
leisure is measured by female labor force participation in the country-of-ancestry; and its
coefficient is positive as expected.
Panel B presents the results where the dependent variable is hours worked for
females, conditional on working. Both higher taxes in the country of residence and higher
culture of leisure in the country of origin reduce female hours. Culture coefficients are
statistically different from zero in models 2, 3, and 4 when taxes are measured by average
personal income tax rate for a single person without a dependent, and in models 2, 4 and 5
with effective marginal tax rate on labor income. The picture that emerges in Table 5 is that
for females, taxes have a negative impact on labor supply both at the extensive and intensive
margins, and culture of leisure also negatively impacts labor supply, although the precision
of the estimated coefficients varies between specifications.
Table 6 reports the results of the same models for males. In Panel A we observe that
taxes have a negative impact on labor force participation, regardless of the measure of culture
and regardless of the measure of taxes. On the other hand, the coefficients of culture
variables are never statistically different from zero. Panel B summarizes the models that
investigate hours worked for males, conditional on working. While there is evidence on the
impact of taxes on labor male labor supply, culture of leisure has no impact on hours worked
for males.

20

In Table 7 we summarize these results by reporting them in elasticity form. The
elasticities with respect to taxes are based on median estimate of the effective marginal tax
rate coefficients, and the elasticity with respect to culture is the median estimate within the
relevant panels of Tables 5 and 6. The implied aggregate hours elasticity for taxes is -0.42
for females and -0.27 for males.14 The impact of culture of leisure, expressed in elasticity
terms, is smaller than the impact of taxes, but still sizable for female labor supply, while
culture of leisure has no impact on men‟s labor market activity.
To put these elasticities in perspective, note for example, that in Belgium average
hours per working age population was 989 in 2012, and the effective marginal tax rate is
57%. In Portugal, average hours worked in 2012 was 1,237 and the effective marginal tax
rate is 41%. If the tax rate in Belgium goes down 16 percentage points to bring it down to
the level prevailing in Portugal, this would be a 28 percent reduction and using the elasticity
estimates for men and women in Table 7, and using the weights of men and women in
employment, we find that aggregate hours would go up by 9% or by 93 hours per workingage person. This would help close the gap in hours of work between Belgium and Portugal
(see Table 1) by about 45%. This is possibly an under-estimate because the elasticity we use
is uncompensated, and it does not take into account the income effect.
The mean value of the response to the question of “Work is Duty towards Society”
(1: Strongly Agree, 5: Strongly disagree) is 2.3 in Belgium. If the tastes for leisure were
weaker so that the mean response to this question was 1.91 (the level in Portugal), this would
constitute a 17% decline in the intensity of tastes for leisure. This change in preferences
would impact hours worked only through its effect on females, because in case of males
14

These estimates are smaller than those summarized by Chetty et al. (2011) but the numbers reported in
Table 7 are uncompensated elasticities, while the ones reported by Chetty et al. (2011) are compensated
elasticities.
21

neither participation nor hours respond to changes in culture of leisure. The impact on
aggregate hours worked per working age population would be an increase by 39 hours (about
4%). This would close the gap in hours worked between Belgium and Portugal by 20%.
Table 8 reports the same models reported earlier, but these models include countryof-origin fixed-effects. As a result, we cannot identify the impact of leisure variables, but we
can investigate whether the impact of taxes is altered by this specification. Table 8 displays
the coefficients of the average and marginal taxes in both the participation and hours
equations. They are very similar to those reported in Tables 5 and 6.
Tables 9 and 10 display the results of the analogous exercise, but in this case, we
replace the country-of-residence variables, including the tax rates, with country of residence
dummies. Country-of-origin variables, including leisure measures, are retained. Table 9
presents the results for females. The estimated coefficients of various measures of leisure are
consistent with the ones reported earlier in both participation and hours decisions, but the
statistical significant is spotty. The results for males, shown in Table 10, are also consistent
with those reported earlier: taste for leisure is not a statistically significant determinant of
men‟s labor market activity.

VI. Summary and Conclusion
There are substantial differences in aggregate hours worked between countries. In an
influential paper, using a growth model Prescott (2004) argued that virtually all of the
difference in hours worked between the U.S. and Europe can be explained by the differences
in tax rates. A large literature that followed Prescott (2004) provided various extensions

22

ranging from consideration of households‟ self-insurance through asset accumulation
(Ljungqvist and Sargent 2006) to incorporation of household production (McDaniel 2011).
Taxes distort the margin at which the market labor supply decision is made and
higher taxes on labor income motivate people to shift away from market work to leisure. The
large magnitude of the labor supply response in the Prescott framework, however, prompted
the skeptics to suggest alternative or complementary mechanisms to explain the labor supply
differences between countries, including the importance of regulations and labor unions
(Alesina, Glaeser and Sacerdote 2005). One important point in this framework is the
assumption of homogeneous preferences between countries. While it has been explicitly
acknowledged that preferences for leisure may not be identical between countries (Blanchard
2006), no research has addressed the question of whether or not the “taste for leisure” has a
role in labor supply differences.
In this paper we use micro data from European Social Survey that include
information on labor force participation and hours worked of second-generation immigrants
who reside in 26 European countries. These individuals are born in Europe, and they have
been exposed to institutional, legal and labor market structures of their countries, including
the tax rates. Fathers of these individuals are first-generation immigrants and our data allow
us to identify 81 different countries they migrated from. We follow the recent literature on
the impact of culture on economic behavior (Alesina et al. 2015, Alesina and Giuliano 2010,
Fernández 2011) and use immigrant father‟s country of birth to determine the ancestral roots,
and assume that culture of leisure in father‟s country of origin is transmitted from the
immigrant father to the offspring.

23

Using the World Values Survey and the European Values Study, we construct
measures of “taste for leisure” in the country of origin of each immigrant father. These
measures include average responses in a country to such questions as “How Important is
leisure time in your life?” “Do you agree or disagree with the statement: People who don’t
work turn lazy.” “Do you agree or disagree with the statement: Work is a duty to society.”
“Do you agree or disagree with the statement: Work should always come first even if it
means less spare time.” The details of these and other variables that aim to gauge the extent
of culture of leisure in the country of origin are provided in the paper.
We employ two different tax measures. The first one is the average personal income
tax and the social security contribution rate on gross labor income for a single person without
a dependent. The second one is the effective marginal tax rate on labor income. We control
for individual characteristics such age, education, marital status, size of the city and ethnic
minority status. We also control for a set of attributes of the country of residence and
country of origin, ranging from per capita income to legal origin of the country. Thus, we are
able to identify the impact of taxes on labor supply (both at the extensive and intensive
margin), holding constant observable attributes of individuals, various attributes of the
country in which they live, and attributes of their father‟s country of origin, including the
taste for leisure in that country of origin. Similarly, we can identify the impact of culture of
leisure on labor supply, holding constant personal characteristics, and country attributes,
including taxes.
The results show that for women, both taxes and culture of leisure impact participation
and hours worked. For men, taxes influence labor supply both at the intensive and the
extensive margin, but culture of leisure has no impact. We find uncompensated aggregate

24

labor supply elasticity of -0.42 for women and -0.27 for men. The elasticity for “taste for
leisure” is -0.24 for women and zero for men. These results suggest that while labor income
tax is a significant determinant of aggregate hours worked, culture of leisure in the country is
important as well.
Although we do not address the question of “what determines the difference in culture of
leisure between countries?” we should emphasize that recent research has shown that cultural
attributes are malleable, and they react to external factors. For example, Fernández (2013)
shows that social attitudes towards women‟s work endogenously change over time. Alesina
and Fuchs-Schűndeln (2007) find that individual preferences are shaped by the political
regime in which they lives. Giuliano and Spilimbergo (2014) report that individuals‟
political preferences and their support for government redistribution policies are impacted by
whether or not they grew up during recessionary periods. Cannonier and Mocan (2012) find
that women in Sierra Leone, whose years of schooling is increased by an education reform,
are more likely to disapprove certain cultural norms and behaviors. Tastes for leisure, too,
are likely to evolve over time as a cultural attribute. A simple example is the one given by
Alesina, Glaeser and Sacerdote (2006) who suggest that an initial decline in market work
might increase individuals‟ utility from leisure and this process can be amplified by a social
multiplier (Glaeser, Sacerdote and Scheinkman 2003) if there exist complementarities in
leisure. But, regardless of whether culture of leisure evolves gradually or slowly over time,
our results indicate that people would work less in a country if the taste for leisure is stronger
in that country.

The first tax measure (τ) is the effective marginal tax rate on labor income (Prescott 2004).
The second tax measure is the average personal income tax and social security contribution rate on
gross labor income is that for a single person without a dependent earning 100% of average
earnings of industry workers in the country (Source: OECD Tax Database Table 5).
The tax values are averaged for the period 2000 to 2013.

Notes: Personal characteristics variables data come from the ESS survey. The question about hours normally worked in a
week refers to the respondent‟s current job if he or she is currently employed and to the most recent job if he or she is
unemployed at the time of the interview. We restrict our sample to second-generation immigrants who are either working
at the time of the interview or have held their last job in year 2000 or later and are/were between 16 and 64 years of age at
the time of working. We also exclude individuals who reported either zero hours normally worked or more than 100
hours. Survey weights are used.
avg_all_in100 sample includes the following countries of destination: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark,
Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway,
Poland, Portugal, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, and the United Kingdom.
τ sample includes the following countries of destination: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France,
Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain,
Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.
Depending on specification, measures of culture of leisure are available for the following number of observations: Leisure
Important – from to 1,785 to 3,043; Generous Holidays – from 1,742 to 2,916; People Turn Lazy, Work Is a Duty to
Society, and Work Should Come First – from 1,675 to 2,801; Country of Origin Average Hours – from 1,467 to 2,004.
A: World Values Survey and European Values Study data. The original variable Leisure Important had reverse scale; it
was recoded so that higher values correspond to “lazier” culture.
