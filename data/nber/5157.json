    "abstract": "\n\nWe study the effects of bicycle safety regulations in both the United States and the United Kingdom on bicycle accident rates for various population age groups.  We find small, statistically significant decreases in the accident rates as the stock of bicycles increases its compliance with the regulations.  This result is independent of country, season, and trend effects and holds across a range of age groups.  The results run counter to those in similar studies.  This appears to reflect our focus on a specific standard, rather than on broad enabling legislation, and the longer time series available.\n\n",
