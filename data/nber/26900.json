    "abstract": "\n\nUtilizing a novel dataset from an online travel intermediary, we study the effects of EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The opt-in requirement of GDPR resulted in 12.5% drop in the intermediary-observed consumers, but the remaining consumers are trackable for a longer period of time. Our findings imply that privacy conscious consumers exert privacy externalities on opt-in consumers, making them more predictable. Consistent with this finding, the average value of the remaining consumers to advertisers has increased, offsetting some of the losses from consumer opt-outs.\n\n",
