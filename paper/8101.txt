1. Introduction
Individuals sort in a variety of fashions. The workplace, the school of one’s child, the
choice of neighborhood in which to reside, and the selection of a spouse are all important
arenas in which a choice of peers and access to particular goods and networks is explicitly
or implicitly made. The aim of this chapter is to review the subset of the literature in
the rapidly growing …eld of education and inequality that is primarily concerned with
how individuals sort and the consequences of this for the accumulation of human capital,
equity, e¢ciency and welfare.
At …rst blush, sorting may seem like a rather strange lens through which to examine
education. After all, this …eld has been primarily concerned with examining issues such
as the returns to education, the nature of the education production function or, at a
more macro level, the relationship between education and per-capita output growth.1
A bit more thought, though, quickly reveals that sorting is an integral component of
these questions. Who one goes to school with, who one’s neighbors are, who one
works with, and who is a member of one’s household, are all likely to be important
ingredients in determining both the resources devoted to and the returns to human
capital accumulation.
It is interesting to note that in all these spheres there is at least some evidence
indicating that sorting is increasing in the US. Jargowsky (1996), for example, examines
the changing pattern of residential segregation in the US over the last few decades.
He …nds that although racial and ethnic segregation has stayed fairly constant (with
some small decline in recent years), segregation by income has increased (for Whites,
Blacks and Hispanics) in all US metropolitan areas from 1970 to 1990. This increased
economic segregation, and the fact that schools increasingly track students by ability,
suggests that there is likely to be increased sorting at the school or classroom level by
income and ability. Kremer and Maskin (1996) …nd evidence for the US, Britain, and

For a survey of the education production function literature see Hanushek (1986), for returns to
education see, for example, Heckman, Layne-Farrar, and Todd (1996), for education and growth, see,
for example, Benhabib and Spiegel (1994).

France that there is increased sorting of workers into …rms, with some high-tech …rms
(e.g., silicon valley …rms) employing predominantly high-skilled workers and low-tech
…rms (e.g., fast-food industry) employing predominantly low-skilled workers. Lastly,
there is also some indication of greater sorting at the level of household partner (or
“marital” sorting). Although the correlation between spousal partners in terms of years
of education has not changed much over the last few decades (see Kremer (1997)), the
conditional probability of some sociological barriers being crossed–e.g., the probability
that an individual with only a high-school education will match with another with a
college education–has decreased, indicating greater household sorting (see Mare (1991)).
This chapter will examine some of the literature that deals with the intersection of
sorting, education and inequality. This review is not meant to be exhaustive, but to give
a ‡avor of some of the advances in the theory and quantitative evidence. Furthermore, it
should be noted that there is no overarching theoretical framework in this …eld. Rather,
di¤erent models are interesting because of how they illuminate some of the particular
interactions among these variables and others–for example, the role of politics, the
interaction between private and public schools, or the e¢cacy of di¤erent mechanisms
(e.g. markets versus tournaments) in solving assignment problems. Thus, rather than
sketch the contribution of each paper, I have chosen to discuss a few models in depth.
Furthermore, as a primary concern in this area is the magnitude of di¤erent e¤ects,
wherever possible I focus on the contributions that have attempted to evaluate these.
The organization of the chapter is as follows. I begin with the topic of residential
sorting. Local schooling is prevalent in most of the world. This policy easily leads to
residential sorting and may have important implications for education and inequality,
particularly in countries like the US in which the funding of education is also largely
at the local level. I also use this section to review the theory of sorting. Next, I
turn to examining sorting at the school level. The papers here are di¤erent as they
are primarily concerned with the interaction of public and private schools and with the
properties of di¤erent mechanisms. Lastly I turn to recent work on household sorting
and its consequences for education and inequality.

2. Sorting into Neighborhoods
Neighborhoods do not tend to be representative samples of the population of the whole.
Why is this? Sorting into neighborhoods may occur because of preferences for amenities
associated with a particular neighborhood (say parks), because of some individuals’
desire to live with some types of people or not to live with some others (say ethnic
groups who wish to live together in order to preserve their culture, or who end up doing
so as a result of discrimination), and in response to economic incentives. This chapter
will be primarily concerned with the latter, and in particular with the endogenous
sorting that occurs in response to economic incentives that arise as a result of education
policies.
Primary and secondary education is a good that is provided locally. In industrialized
countries, the overwhelming majority of children attend public schools (in the US a
bit over 91 percent in 1996 and similar percentages in other countries).2 Typically,
children are required to live in the school’s district to attend school there, making
a neighborhood’s school quality a primary concern of families in deciding where to
reside. Furthermore, in most countries at least some school funding (usually that used
to increase spending above some minimum) is provided locally; this is particularly true
in the US in which only 6.6 percent of funding is at the federal level, 48 percent is at
the state level, and 42 percent is at the local level.3
Does it matter that education is provided at the local level? How does local provision
of education a¤ect the accumulation of human capital, its distribution, and e¢ciency
in general? What are the dynamic consequences of local provision? How do other
systems of …nancing and providing education compare? These are some of the question
this section will explore. I will start out with a brief overview of the economics of
sorting, much of which will carry through to the other sections as well.
2.1. Multi-Community Models: The Economics of Sorting
Characterizing equilibrium in models in which heterogeneous individuals can choose
among a given number of potential residences, and in which these choices in aggregate

a¤ect the attributes of the community, is in general a di¢cult task. Since Westho¤
(1977), economists working with these often called “multi-community models” have
tended to impose a single-crossing condition on preferences in order to obtain and characterize equilibria in which individuals either partially or completely separate out by
type.4 As will be discussed in further detail below, the single-crossing condition also
has two other very useful implications: (i) It guarantees the existence of a majority
voting equilibrium over p; (ii) In many models it allows one to get rid of “trivial” equilibria (e.g. one in which all communities are identical) when a local stability condition
is employed.
A typical multi-community model consists of a given number of communities, each
associated with a bundle (q; p). These bundles consist of a good or input is provided
in some quality or quantity q at the community level and of a community level price p
of some (usually other) good or service. The latter can simply be a price associated
with residing in the neighborhood, e.g., a local property tax. Thus, we can assess the
indirect utility of an individual from these residing in a given community as V (q; p; y)
where y is an attribute of the individual such as income, ability, parental human capital,
wealth or taste. We will assume throughout that q is “good” in the sense that Vq > 0,
whereas Vp < 0.
Individuals choose a community in which to reside. In these models, equilibria in
which individuals sort into communities along their characteristic y are obtained by
requiring the slope of indi¤erence curves in (q; p) space,
¯
dp ¯¯
Vq

dq ¯v=v
Vp

(2.1)

to be everywhere increasing (or decreasing) in y. This implies that indi¤erence curves
cross only once and that where they do, if (2.1) is increasing in y, then the slope of the
curve of an individual with a higher y is greater than one with a lower y (the opposite
if (2.1) is decreasing in y).
The assumption of a slope that increases (decreases) in y ensures that if an individual
with yi prefers the bundle (qj ; pj ) o¤ered by community j to some other bundle (qk ; p k)
o¤ered by community k, and pj > p k , then the same preference ordering over these

In games of asymmetric information (e.g., signalling models, insurance provsion, etc.), the assumption of single-crossing indi¤erence curves is used in order to obtain either partial or completely separating
equilibria.

bundles is shared by all individuals with y > yi (y < y i). Alternatively if the individual
with yi prefers (qk ; pk ), then community k will also be preferred to community j by all
individuals with y < yi (y > yi ).
Either an increasing or decreasing slope can be used to obtain separation.5 Henceforth, unless explicitly stated otherwise, I will assume that (2.1) is increasing in y, i.e.,

(2.2)

We shall refer to equilibria in which there is (at least some) separation by characteristic
as sorting or strati…cation.
Condition (2.2) is very powerful. Independently of the magnitude of the expression,
the fact that it is positive implies that individuals have an incentive to sort. As we
shall discuss in the next section, this will be problematic for e¢ciency since it implies
that even very small private incentives to sort will lead to a strati…ed equilibrium,
independently of the overall social costs (which may be large) from doing so.
There are many economic situations in which condition (2.2) arises naturally. Suppose, for example, that q is the quality of education and that this is determined by
either a lump sum or proportional tax p on income. If individuals are, for example,
heterogeneous in income (so y denotes the income of the individual), then this condition would imply that higher-income individuals are willing to pay more (either in
levels or as a proportion of their income, depending on the de…nition of p) in order to
obtain a greater quality of education. This can then result in a equilibrium strati…ed
along the dimension of income. Alternatively, if the quality of education is determined
by the mean ability of individuals in the community school, p is the price of housing
in the community, and individuals are heterogeneous in ability y, then (2.2) will be
met if higher-ability individuals are willing to pay a higher price of housing in order
to obtain higher quality (mean ability) schooling, allowing the possibility of a strati…ed
equilibrium along the ability dimension.
It is important to note, given the centrality of borrowing constraints in the human
capital literature, that di¤erential willingness to pay a given price is not the only crite5

Note that although either assumption can be used to obtain separation, the economic implications
are very di¤erent, If increasing, then in a strati…ed equilibrium higher y individuals would obtain a
higher (q; p) whereas, if decreasing, the high (q; p) bundle would be obtained by lower y individuals.

6

rion that determines whether sorting occurs.6 Suppose, for example, that individuals
are unable to borrow against future human capital or, less restrictively, that individuals
with lower income, or lower wealth, or whose parents have a lower education level face
a higher cost of borrowing. Then even in models in which there is no other incentive to
sort (e.g., in which the return to human capital is not increasing in parental assets or,
more generally, in which Vq is not a function of y), there will nonetheless be an incentive
to sort if the cost of residing in communities with higher q’s (i.e., the e¤ective p that
individuals face) is decreasing in y. So, for example, if individuals with lower assets
face a higher e¤ective cost of borrowing (they are charged higher rates of interest by
banks), then they will be outbid by higher-asset individuals for housing in communities
with a higher q’s.
In many variants of multi-community models not only does (2.2) give rise to strati…ed
equilibria, but it also implies that all locally stable equilibrium must be strati…ed.7 In
particular, the equilibrium in which all communities o¤er the same bundle, and thus
each contain a representative slice of the population, is locally unstable.8
There are many local stability concepts that can be imposed in multi-community
models. A particularly simple one is to de…ne local stability as the property that the
relocation of a small mass of individuals from one community to another implies that
under the new con…guration of (q; p) in these communities, the relocated individuals
would prefer to reside in their original community. More rigorously, an equilibrium
is locally stable if there exists an " > 0, such that, for all possible combinations of
measure ± (0 < ± · ") of individuals yi 2 ¤¤j (where ¤¤j is the set of individuals that
in equilibrium reside in community j), a switch in residence from community j to k
implies
V (qk (±); p k (±); y) · V (qj (±); pj (±); y) 8y 2 ¤jk ; 8j; k
(2.3)
where (ql (±); p l (±)) are the new bundles of (q; p) that result in community l = j; k: Thus,
condition (2.3) requires that, for all individuals who switch residence (the set ¤jk ), at
the new bundles they should still prefer community j. This condition is required to hold
6

For human capital models in which imp erfections in credit markets play a central role, see Fernández
and Rogerson (1998), Galor and Zeira (1993), Ljungqvist (1993), and Loury (1981), among others.
7
In many settings this gives rise to a unique locally stable equilibrium.
8
Note that this zero sorting con…guration is always an equilibrium in multicommunity models as no
single individual has an incentive to move.

7

for all community pairs considered.9
To see why the equilibrium with no sorting is rarely locally stable, consider, for
example, the relocation of a small mass of high y individuals from community j to k.
In models in which the provision of the local good is decided by majority vote, this will
tend to make the new community more attractive to the movers (and the old one less
attractive) since the median voter in community k will now have preferences closer to
those of the high y individuals whereas the opposite will be true in community j. In
models in which q is an increasing function of the mean of y (or an increasing function
of an increasing function of the mean of y), such as when q is spending per student or
the average of the human capital or ability of parents or students, then again this move
will make community k more attractive than community j for the high y movers. Thus,
in all these cases the no-sorting equilibrium will be unstable.
In several variants of multi-community models existence of an equilibrium (other
than the unstable one with zero sorting) is not guaranteed.10 For example, in a model
in which the community bundle is decided upon by majority vote and voters take community composition as given, a locally stable equilibrium may fail to exist. The reason
for this is that although there will exist (often in…nite) sequences of community bundles
that sort individuals into communities, majority vote need not generate any of these
sequences. Introducing a good (e.g. housing) whose supply is …xed at the local level
(so that the entire adjustment is in prices) though will typically give rise to existence.11
Condition (2.2) also has an extremely useful implication for the political economy
aspect of multi-community models. Suppose that p and q are functions of some other
variable t to be decided upon by majority vote by the population in the community
(say a local tax rate). They may also be functions, as well, of the characteristics
of the (endogenous) population in the community. An implication of (2.2) is that
independently of whether p and q are “nicely” behaved functions of t, the equilibrium
outcome of majority vote over t will be the value preferred by the individual whose y is
median in the community.
The proof of this is very simple. Consider the (feasible) bundle (e
q; pe) preferred by
9
See, e.g., Fernández and Rogerson (1996). If communities have only a …xed number of slots for
individuals as in models in which the quantity of housing is held …xed, then this de…nition must b e
ammended to include the relocation of a corresp onding mass of individuals from community k to j.

11
See, for example, Nechyba (1997).

8

the median y individual in the community, henceforth denoted ye. An implication of
(2.2) is that any feasible (q; p) bundle that is greater than (e
q; pe) will be rejected by at
least 50 percent of the residents in favor of (e
q; pe), in particular by all those whose y is
smaller than e
y. On the other hand, any feasible bundle with a (q; p) lower than (e
q; pe)
will also be rejected by 50 percent of the residents, namely all those with y > ye. Thus,
the bundle preferred by e
y will be chosen by majority vote.12
It is also important to note that even in the absence of a single-crossing condition, to
the extent that education is funded in a manner that implies redistribution at the local
level, wealthier individuals will have an incentive to move away from less wealthy ones.
This is by itself a powerful force that favors sorting but often requires a mechanism (e.g.
zoning) to prevent poorer individuals chasing richer individuals in order to enjoy both
a higher q and a lower p.
For example, a system of local provision of education funded by a local property
tax implicitly redistributes from those with more expensive housing to those with less
expensive housing in the same neighborhood. The extent of redistribution, though,
can be greatly minimized by zoning regulations that, for example, require minimum lot
sizes.13 This will raise the price of living with the wealthy and thus greatly diminish
the amount of redistribution that occurs in equilibrium. In several models, to simplify
matters, it will be assumed that mechanisms such as zoning ensure perfect sorting.
2.2. The E¢ciency of Local Provision of Education
The simplest way to model the local provision of education is in a Tiebout model
with (exogenously imposed) perfect sorting. In this model, individuals with di¤erent
incomes y i but with identical preferences over consumption c and quality of education q
sort themselves into homogeneous communities. Each community maximizes the utility
of its own representative individual subject to the individual or community budget
constraint. Let us assume that the quality of education depends only on spending per
student (i.e., the provision of education exhibits constant returns to scale and there are
no peer e¤ects). Then, perfect sorting is Pareto e¢cient. Note that this system is
12
See Westho¤ (1977) and Epple and Romer (1991). Also see Gans and Smart (1996) for a more
general ordinal version of single crossing and existence of majority vote.
13
See Fernández and Rogerson (1997b) for an analysis which endogenizes zoning, sorting, and the
provision of education.

9

identical to a purely private system of education provision.
The model sketched in the paragraph above often guides many people’s intuition
in the …eld of education. This is unfortunate as it ignores many issues central to the
provision of education. In particular, it ignores the fact the education is an investment
that bene…ts the child and potentially a¤ects the welfare of others as well. These are
important considerations as the fact that education is primarily an investment rather
than a consumption good implies that borrowing constraints may have signi…cant dynamic consequences; the fact that education primarily a¤ects the child’s (rather than
parental) welfare raises the possibility that parents may not be making the best decisions for the child; and the potential externalities of an agent’s education raises the
usual problems for Pareto optimality.
Below I explore some departures from the assumptions in the basic Tiebout framework and discuss how they lead to ine¢ciency of the strati…ed equilibrium. This will
make clear a simple pervasive problem associated with sorting, namely that utilitymaximizing individuals do not take into account the e¤ect of their residence decisions
on community variables. I start out by discussing the simplest modi…cation to the basic
Tiebout model–reducing the number of communities relative to types.
Following Fernández and Rogerson (1996), consider an economy with a given number
of communities j = f1; 2; :::Ng, each (endogenously) characterized by a proportional
income tax rate tj and a quality of education qj equal to per-pupil expenditure, i.e.,
qj = t j ¹j . Individuals who di¤er in income yi, i 2 I = f1; 2; :::Ig (with y1 > y2 >
::: > yI ), simultaneously decide in which community, Cj , they wish to reside. Once that
decision is taken, communities choose tax rates via majority vote at the community
level. Individuals then consume their after-tax income and obtain education.14
Assume for simplicity that individual preferences are characterized by the following
separable speci…cation:
u(c) + v(q)
14

(2.4)

Very often the literature in this …eld has implicitly adopted a sequencing such as the one outlined
above. Making the order of moves explicit as in Fernández and Rogerson (1996) allows the properties
of equilibrium (e.g., local stability) to be studied in a more rigorous fashion. It would also be of interest
to examine prop erties of models in which communities act more strategically and take into account
the e¤ect of their tax rate on the community composition. There is no reason to believe that this
modi…cation would generate an e¢cient equilibrium, however.

10

00

so that the sorting condition (2.2) is satis…ed if ¡ uu0(c)c
> 1; 8c. We will henceforth
(c)
assume that the inequality is satis…ed, ensuring that individuals with higher income are
willing to su¤er a higher tax rate for higher quality.15
Suppose that the number of communities is smaller than the number of income
types.16 In such a case the equilibrium will generally not be Pareto e¢cient. The
clearest illustration of this can be given for the case in which individuals have preferences
such that an increase in the mean income of the community ceteris paribus decreases
the tax rate that any given individual would like to impose. As the preferred tax
rate of an individual is given by equating u0(c)yi to v 0 (q)¹j, this is ensured by assuming
00
17
¡ vv0(q)q
(q) > 1 (note that this is the parallel of the condition on u that generates sorting).
As discussed previously, the result of majority vote at the community level is the
preferred tax rate of the median income individual in the community. A few things
to note about the characteristics of equilibrium. First, in equilibrium no community
will be empty. If one were, then in any community that contained more than one
income type, those with higher income would be made better o¤ by moving to the
empty community, imposing their preferred tax rate, and engaging in no redistribution.
Second, in a locally stable equilibrium communities cannot o¤er the same bundles and
contain more than one type of individual (as a small measure of those with higher income
could move to one of the communities, increase mean income there and end up with the
same or a higher income median voter who has preferences closer to theirs’). Lastly,
if communities have di¤erent qualities of education (as they must if the communities
are heterogeneous), then a community with a strictly higher q than another must also
have a strictly higher t (as otherwise no individual would choose to reside in the lower
quality-higher tax community).
In the economic environment described above all locally stable equilibria must be
strati…ed, i.e., individuals will sort into communities by income. In such equilibria,
15

Most assumptions here are for simplicity only, e.g., preferences need not be separable and introducing
housing and property taxation rather than income taxation would allow a sorting equilibrium to b e
characterized by higher-income communities having lower tax rates (but higher tax inclusive prices) and
higher q. We forego the last option as it simply complicates matters without contributing additional
insights.
16
Note that type here is synonymous with income level. Hence the assumption that there are fewer
neighborhoods than types is a reasonable one to make.
17
This assumption implies that an increase in the mean income of the community that does not change
the identity of the median voter will result in a higher q and a lower t ensuring that all residents are
made better o¤.

11

communities can be ranked by the quality of education they o¤er, their income tax
rate, and the income of the individuals that belong to them. Thus, all stable equilibria
can be characterized by a ranking of communities such that 8j, qj > qj+1, t j > t j+1,
and min yi 2 Cj ¸ max y i 2 Cj+1 .
To facilitate the illustration of ine¢ciency, assume for simplicity that there are only
two communities j = 1; 2 and I > 2 types of individuals.18 A strati…ed equilibrium
will have all individuals with income strictly greater than some level yb living in C1 and
those with income strictly lower than yb living in C2 with q2 > q1 and t 2 > t 1.
Suppose that in equilibrium individuals with income yb live in both communities. It
is easy to graph the utility
Wbj ´ u(y b(1 ¡ tj )) + v(tj ¹j )

(2.5)

of these “boundary” individuals as a function of the community in which they reside
and as a function of the fraction ½b of these individuals that reside in C1. Let ½¤b denote
the equilibrium value of the boundary individuals residing in C1. Note that a decrease
in ½b from its equilibrium value that does not alter the identity of the median voter in
either community will make individuals with income yb better o¤ in both communities
as mean incomes will rise, qualities of education increase, and tax rates fall in both
communities. Thus in order for this equilibrium to be locally stable, it must be that
such a decrease makes yb individuals even better o¤ in C1 relative to C2, reversing the
outward ‡ow and reestablishing ½¤b as the equilibrium. Thus, as shown in Figure 1, the
Wb1 curve must cross the Wb2 curve from above.19
This equilibrium is clearly ine¢cient. Consider a marginal subsidy of s > 0 to all
individuals with income yb who choose to reside in C2 .20 Given that without a subsidy
these individuals are indi¤erent between residing in either of the two communities, it
follows that a subsidy will increase the attractiveness of C2 relative to C1 . Consequently,
some yb individuals will move to C2, thereby increasing mean income in both communities. For a small enough subsidy such that the identity of the median voter does not

See Fernández and Rogerson (1996) for a generalization of this argument to many communities.
Note that we are assuming for the range of ½ b shown that neither of the communities’ median voters
are changing.

If income is unobservable, then a small subsidy to all individuals who reside in C2 would have to
be paid.
19

change in either community, the overall e¤ect will be to decrease tax rates and increase
the quality of education in both communities, thus making all individuals better o¤.
Thus, it only remains to show that the subsidy can be …nanced in such a way to retain
the Pareto improving nature of this policy. A simple way to do so is by (marginally)
taxing those y b individuals who remain in C1.21 This tax will only further increase their
out‡ow from C1 to the point where they are once again indi¤erent between residing in
both communities. As shown in Figure 1, the tax serves to further increase the utility
of this income group (and consequently everyone else’s). This last point suggests that
a simpler way of producing the same Pareto-improving results is a policy that foregoes
the subsidy and simply taxes any yb individual in C1. This would again induce the
desired migration and increase mean income in both communities.
Fernández and Rogerson (1996) examine these and other interventions in a model
with many communities. The principle guiding the nature of Pareto-improving policies
is not a¤ected by the number of communities considered; policies that serve to increase
mean income in some or in all communities by creating incentives to move relatively
wealthier individuals into poorer communities will generate Pareto improvements.22
The possibility of Pareto improvements over the decentralized equilibrium in the
model above arises as a result of individuals not taking into account the e¤ect of their
residence decisions on community mean income. In the next example, the ine¢ciency
of equilibrium results from individual residence decisions not internalizing diminishing
returns.
Consider a multi-community model with two communities, C1 and C2 , and a total
population (of parents) of N = 2. Parents di¤er in their human capital, hi , and
potentially in their own income yi . To simplify matters we assume that the initial
distribution is con…ned to two values h1 and h2 with h1 > h2 and total numbers of
parents of each type given by n1 and n2 , respectively, such that n1 + n2 = 2.
We assume that each community has a …xed number of residences, N=2 = 1 each
available at a price pj , j = 1; 2. Let ¸1 be the fraction of high human-capital parents
who choose to live in C1 (and thus ¸2 = n1 ¡¸1) and let ¹j be the mean human capital
of parents that reside in Cj . Thus, ¹j (¸j ) = ¸j h1 + (1 ¡ ¸j )h2.
21
Again, if income is not observable, it is possible to preserve the Pareto improving nature of this
policy by (marginally) taxing all C1 residents.
22
The exact speci…cation of these policies, however, depends on the number of communities involved
in a rather odd fashion as explained in Fernández (1997).

13

Parents decide in which community to live, pay the price pj of residing there, and
send their children to the community school. Parents care about aggregate family
consumption, which is given by the sum of their own income and the child’s future
income, I, minus the cost of residing in the community and a lump-sum transfer T.
The child’s future income is an increasing function of the human capital she acquires.
This depends on her parent’s human capital and on local human capital q which is
assumed to be an increasing function of the mean human capital in the neighborhood.
As the latter is simply a linear function of ¸j , we denote this function as qj = Q(¸j ),
Q0 > 0. Thus,
Iij = F (hi; Q(¸j ))

(2.6)

with Fh; Fq > 0 and where Iij indicates the income of a child with a parent of human
capital hi that resides in neighborhood j.
Hence, parents choose a community in which to reside that maximizes
u(yi + Iij ¡ p j + T )

(2.7)

subject to (2.6) and taking p j , T and qj as given. Note that if parental and local human
capital are complements in the production of a child’s future income, then (2.7) obeys
(2.2), and hence individuals will sort.23 Henceforth, I will assume this is the case, that
is,

Given (2.8), the only locally stable equilibrium is that with maximal sorting. Individuals with human capital h1 live in C1, characterized by a higher p and a higher q
than that in C2; individuals with h2 live in C2 . If the number of one of these types
exceeds the space available in a community (i.e., 1), then that type is indi¤erent and
lives in both communities. Thus, in equilibrium ¸1 = min(1; n1 ).
In order to close the model, we need to specify housing prices. Rather than determining the price by specifying the microfoundations of the housing market, as in many
23

See de Bartolome (1990) for a two-community …xed housing stock model in which there is complementarity between spending on education and ability but in which peer e¤ects matter more for low
ability students.

14

models in the literature we simply solve for the price di¤erential such that no individual would wish to move.24 Depending on whether n1 is greater, smaller or equal to 1,
there are three di¤erent possible con…gurations as in the …rst case h1 types must be
made indi¤erent (p1 ¡ p 2 = y 011 ¡ y012 ), in the second h2 types must be made indi¤erent
0 ¡ y 0 ), whereas in the third each type must be at least as well o¤ in its
(p1 ¡ p2 = y21

as in de Bartolome (1990), that housing rents are rebated to individuals in a lump2
sum fashion so that each individual receives T = p1 +p
regardless of the community of
2

residence.
Is the decentralized equilibrium e¢cient? Rather than characterizing Pareto improving policies, I will con…ne my discussion here to investigating whether the unique
locally stable decentralized equilibrium (that with maximum sorting) maximizes productive e¢ciency.
The tensions that exist in this model are easy to de…ne. On the one hand, parental
and local human capital are complements, suggesting that future output is maximized by
sorting, i.e., e¢ciency requires concentrating high-human capital parents in the same
community, precisely what occurs in equilibrium. On the other hand, there is an
externality to individual residence decisions that is not being taken into account, namely
potentially decreasing returns to the concentration of high human-capital individuals in
the same neighborhood. In particular, individuals do not take into account whether an
additional unit of high human capital on the margin increases local human capital more
in the community with a high or low concentration of h1. Similarly, they do not take
into account whether a marginal increase in local human capital will add more to total
output by being allocated to a community with a high or low concentration of h1.
To see this more formally, consider the total future income Y generated by a community given that a fraction ¸ of high human-capital parents live there:
24

See Wheaton (1977) and de Bartolome (1990).
See Benabou (1993) for a multi-community model in which individuals can acquire high or low skills
or be unemployed. The costs of acquiring skills are decreasing in the proportion of the community that
is highly skilled but this decrease is larger for those acquiring high skills. This leads to sorting although
ex ante all individuals are identical. As in the model discussed here, there will be maximal sorting by (ex
post) high-skill individuals. The interesting question is this paper is how the decentralized equilibrium
compares to one with no sorting given that neither is e¢cient (since in both cases individuals ignore
the externality of their skill acquisition decision on the costs faced by others).
25

15

(2.9)

Y (¸) = ¸F (h1; Q(¸)) + (1 ¡ ¸)F(h2 ; Q(¸))

Note that if future income is concave in ¸, then it is maximized by allocating high
human-capital parents so that they constitute the same proportion in both communities,
i.e., ¸1 = ¸2 . If, on the other hand, future income is convex in ¸, then maximum sorting
will maximize future income, i.e., as in the decentralized equilibrium ¸1 = min(1; n1).
Taking the appropriate derivatives yields:
Y 00 = 2 [Fq (h1 ; Q(¸)) ¡ Fq (h2 ; Q(¸))] + [¸Fq (h1; Q(¸)) +

(2.10)

(1 ¡ ¸)Fq (h2; Q(¸))]Q00 + [¸Fqq (h1; Q(¸)) + (1 ¡ ¸)Fqq (h2; Q(¸))] Q02

Let us carefully examine the terms in (2.10). The complementarity of parental
and local human capital in the production of children’s human capital guarantees that
the expression in the …rst square brackets is positive. Thus, this factor pushes in the
direction of convexity of Y and thus in favor of sorting. Recall from (2.8) that it is
only on the basis of this factor that sorting occurs in equilibrium. If there is decreasing
returns to community mean human capital in the formation of local human capital,
however, i.e., if Q is concave (and thus Q00 < 0), then Q00 times the expression in
the second square brackets will be negative, imposing losses from concentrating parents
with high human-capital in the community. Lastly, there will be an additional loss from
sorting if there is decreasing returns to local human capital in the production of future
income, i.e., if Fqq < 0, as this implies that the term in the third square brackets is
negative. Thus, decreasing returns to community mean human capital in the formation
of local human capital and decreasing returns to local human capital in the production
of children’s future income suggest that Y is concave, and hence that e¢ciency would be
maximized by having parents with high-human capital distributed in both communities
in the same proportion.26
It is important to recall that maximum sorting will take place as long as Fhq is
positive but otherwise independently of its magnitude. Hence a very small amount of
complementarity (again, the expression in the …rst square brackets) and private gain
26
If Y is not globally concave nor convex, then the equilibrium will still produce too much sorting
and some redistributing of high human capital individuals towards a more equal distribution will b e
e¢ciency enhancing.

16

could easily be swamped by the concavity of F and Q and social loss.
The model presented above is one in which all sorting is taking place because of
peer e¤ects–that is, people want to live with individuals with high human capital as it
increases the earnings of their children. As local human capital and parental human
capital are complements, high human capital parents outbid others to live in a community where the level of local human capital is highest, leading to strati…cation by
parental human capital levels. Note that income and the perfection or imperfection of
capital markets actually played no role in producing the results above.27
The above analysis also suggests that if spending on education E were an additional
factor in the production of future income but not a factor that individuals sorted on,
i.e., F(h; Q(¸); E(¸)) with FE > 0, E0 > 0 and FhE = 0, then sorting would occur for
the same reasons as before, but even a policy of enforced equalization of spending across
communities would not stop individuals from sorting.
Unfortunately, there has been very little work done to assess the signi…cance of
the ine¢ciencies discussed above. Although much work points, for example, to the
importance of peer e¤ects in learning, whether the appropriate cross-partial is negative
or positive remains in dispute (i.e., we do not even know whether it would be e¢cient, all
considerations of diminishing returns aside, for children to sort by aptitude, for example,
or for them to mix).28 Similarly, we do not know whether quality of education (say
spending) and parental human capitals are complements. This, to my view, makes
models in which the main imperfection lies in the functioning of the capital market
(and sorting on grounds of minimizing redistribution) relatively more attractive.29
27
The fact that utility depends only on total net family income and that the latter is not in‡uenced
by spending allows us to abstract from issues of borrowing and lending as long as parents have su¢cient
income to bid succesfully for housing.
28
For example, Henderson, Mieszkowski, and Sauvageau (1978) argue for a zero cross partial and
dimishing returns whereas Summers and Wolfe (1977) for a negative cross partial.
29
These borrowing constraints may not allow families to b orrow to send their child to private school, for
example. Alternatively, they may not allow poorer families to borrow to live in (wealthy) neighb orhoods
with higher quality public education. The general failure of these credit markets is that parents are
unable to borrow against the future human capital of their children.

2.3. Comparing Systems of Financing Public Education: Dynamic Considerations
The choice of education …nance system matters for various reasons. First, and foremost,
di¤erent …nance systems tend to imply di¤erent levels of redistribution. In economies
in which there is imperfect access to …nancing the acquisition of human capital, redistribution can play an important role in increasing the human capital levels of children
from lower-income families. Di¤erent …nance systems may also may have important
consequences for who lives where and thus for the identity of a child’s peers and for the
use of the land market.
There have been several papers written in this area that examine primarily the static
consequences of di¤erent systems of …nancing education.30 Fernandez and Rogerson
(1999b), for example, examine …ve di¤erent education …nance systems, and contrast the
equity and resources devoted to education across these systems assuming that the parameters of the education …nance system are chosen by majority vote. They calibrate
their benchmark model to US statistics and …nd that total spending on education may
di¤er by as much as 25% across systems. Furthermore, the trade-o¤ between redistribution and resources to education is not monotone; total spending on education is
high in two of the systems that also substantially work to reduce inequality. A political economy approach to the contrast of di¤erent education …nance systems has also
been pursued by Silva and Sonstelie (1995) and Fernandez and Rogerson (1999a) who
attempt to explain the consequences of California’s education …nance reform, whereas
Nechyba (1996) and de Bartolome (1997) both study foundation systems. There is also a
growing empirical literature devoted to examining how changes in state-level education
…nance systems a¤ect education spending, including Downes and Schoeman, (1998),
Loeb (1998), Hoxby (1998), Evans, Murphy, and Schwab (1997, 1998), and Manwaring
and She¤rin (1997).
The papers mentioned above, however, are only indirectly concerned with the consequences of sorting and they are all static models. In this section, by way of contrast, we
will focus on dynamic consequences of sorting in response to di¤erent education …nance
systems. To facilitate the theoretical analysis, we will focus on two extreme systems: a
30

See Inman (1978) for an early quantitative comparison of education …nance systems in the context
of an explicit model.

18

pure local system with perfect sorting and a state system with uniform school spending
per student across communities.31
This section presents two models.32 The …rst, based on Fernández and Rogerson
(1997a, 1998) uses a Tiebout model in which perfect sorting, from a static perspective, is
e¢cient. It then examines the trade-o¤ imposed by switching to a state …nanced system.
The model is calibrated to US statistics, allowing one to determine whether these tradeo¤s are quantitatively signi…cant. The main trade-o¤ this analysis illustrates is that
between a system that loosely speaking allows individuals to consume bundles that are
“right” for them given their income versus a system that imposes a uniform education
bundle across heterogeneous individuals, but allows for more e¢cient use of resources
from the perspective of future generations. In particular, in an economy in which
borrowing constraints prevent individuals from …nancing their education and missing
insurance markets does not allow children (or parents) to insure against income or ability
shocks, a state system may result in a more e¢cient production of next period’s income
(again in a sense that will be made rigorous below) than in a local system in which the
possibilities for redistribution are only at the local level.33 The trade-o¤s are found to
be quantitatively signi…cant.
The second model is based on Benabou (1996). This is a purely theoretical analysis
that contrasts the short versus long-run consequences of a local compared to a state
system in which the main trade-o¤ is between human capital being complementary in
production at the economy wide level but parental human capital and spending on
education being complementary at the local level.
The simplest contrast between the dynamic consequences of these two extreme forms
of education …nance–local versus state–can be examined in the familiar Tiebout model
of perfect sorting in which income is the only source of heterogeneity among individuals.
This allows us to abstract away from complications that would be introduced by the
political economy of tax choice at the local level when individuals are heterogenous, by
changes in residence over time with the dynamic evolution of the income distribution,
31

See Fernández and Rogerson (forthcoming) for a dynamic analysis of a foundation system.
Other dynamic analysis of education …nance systems include Cooper (1998), Durlauf (1995), Glomm
and Ravikumar (1992), and Saint-Paul and Verdier (1993).
33
It may be ob jected that this analysis confounds two things–the amount of redistribution (or insurance) and the system of education. In reality, education always entails some redistribution and
a multidimensional p olitical economy model would be required to allow one to di¤erentiate between
redistribution directly through income and through education.

by housing (and the ine¢ciencies that stem from taxing this good), peer e¤ects, or
simply from diversity in tastes.34 Note that by considering a Tiebout system with
perfect sorting, we can reinterpret what follows as contrasting a purely private system
of education with a state …nanced one.
Following Fernández and Rogerson (1997a), consider a two-period overlapping generations model in which each person belongs to a household consisting of one old individual (the parent) and a young one (the child). Parents make all the decisions and
have identical preferences described by
U (c; y 0 ) = u(c) + Ew(y0 )

(2.11)

where y0 is next period’s income of the household’s child and E is the expectations
operator.
In the …rst period of life, the child attends school and obtains the quality of education
q determined by her parent’s (equivalently community’s) spending. In the second period,
the now old child receives a draw from the income distribution. A child’s income when
old is assumed to depend on the quality of schooling and on an iid shock » whose
distribution ª(») is assumed to be independent of q. Thus,
y 0 = f (q; »)

(2.12)

Once the adult’s income is determined so is the community of residence as adult.
The adult (now a parent), then decides how much of her income to consume and how
R
much to spend on her own child’s education. Letting v(q) ´ w(f (q; »))dª, we can
now write preferences exactly as in equation (2.4). Assuming that v is well behaved,
under a local system individuals will set spending on education to equate the marginal
utility of consumption with the marginal utility of education quality (i.e., u0 (c) = v0 (q)),
implying a local tax rate ¿(y) and q = ¿(y)y.
We next turn to the determination of spending on education in a state-…nanced
system. We assume that all individuals face the same proportional income tax rate ¿ s
that is used to …nance public education q = ¿ s ¹ and that individuals are unable to opt

See, however, Fernández and Rogerson (1998) for a more complex dynamic model in which the
sorting of individuals into communities endogenously evolves over time along with housing prices and
the housing stock.

20

out of public education to a private system. 35 .
The …rst-order condition for utility maximization now equates the ratio of the marginal utility of consumption and the marginal utility of education quality to the ratio of
u0(c )
the mean relative to individual income, i.e., v0 (q)i = y¹i . Note that this condition re‡ects
the fact that under a state …nancing system, unlike in the local system, the relative
price of a unit of education (in terms of foregone consumption) is not the same across
individuals. Lower-income individuals face a lower price than higher-income individuals. In a local …nance system, on the other hand, this relative price equals one for all
individuals. Under majority vote, concavity of u and v imply that the preferences of
the individual with median income in the population determines the choice of ¿ s .
Letting gt(y) be the income distribution of old individuals at the beginning of period
t, under either education …nance system an equilibrium at the end of period t generates
a beginning-of-period income distribution for period t + 1, gt+1. Let F (g(y)) be the
income distribution that results in the following period given this period’s distribution
of g(y). A steady state in this model then consists of an income distribution g¤ such
that g¤(y) = F(g¤(y)).
Calibrating this simple model involves making choices over the education quality
technology and preferences. There is a large and controversial literature that surround
the education production function and there is no consensus on the form it should
take.36 Guided primarily by simplicity, a convenient speci…cation is y0 = Aqµ », which
yields an elasticity of future income with respect to education quality that is constant
and equal to µ. Evidence presented by Card and Krueger (1992), Wachtel (1976), and
Johnson and Sta¤ord (1973) suggest an elasticity of earnings with respect to education
expenditures close to 0.2. We assume that » is lognormally distributed such that log »
has zero mean and standard deviation ¾» .
Our speci…cation of preferences comes from noting that across US states the share
of personal income devoted to public elementary and secondary education has remained
roughly constant over the 1970-1990 period.37 This property will be satis…ed if the

We calibrate the steady state of the local model to match US statistics. We choose

distribution, respectively $23,100 and $19,900 in the 1980 census. The remaining
parameters to be set are b and ®, as the value of µ is already determined by the elasticity
of earnings with respect to q.
For any given ®, we set b to match the fraction of personal income devoted to public
elementary and secondary education (in 1980 equal to 4.1 percent), that is, to yield
a tax rate ¿ ¤ = 0:041. This determines, for a given value of ®, a value of b given by
[(1¡¿ ¤ )=¿ ¤]®¡1
b=

A° E(»° )
price elasticity of expenditures on education. In our model this can be computed at
the equilibrium price (in terms of the consumption good), which here has been set to
one. A survey of the literature by Bergstrom, Rubinfeld and Shapiro (1982) suggests
an elasticity between ¡0:5 and ¡0:25, yielding ® between ¡1 and ¡2. The second is
from Fernández and Rogerson (1999) who model a foundation education …nance system
and use it to match the distribution of spending per student in California prior to the
Serrano reform. They …nd an implied value for ® equal to ¡0:2.
One of the main questions we are interested in asking is whether a local system will
outperform a state system. Obviously, there is no reason to expect that individuals of
all income levels will prefer one system over another nor that di¤erent generations will
agree on the relative merits of the two systems. In order to have a measure of aggregate
22

welfare, we use the sum of individual utilities, or equivalently, the expected utility than
an agent would obtain if she were to receive a random draw from the equilibrium income
distribution. Thus, we use
Z
Vrt ´

Urt grt (y)dy

(2.15)

as our measure of aggregate welfare at time t where r = L; S (i.e., local L, state S)
indicates the education …nance regime.38
To provide a measure of welfare change at time t that is una¤ected by monotone
transformations of the utility function, we examine the proportion by which the income
distribution in the steady state of the local regime would have to be changed so that
it provided the same aggregate welfare as the state system in period t. Given that the
functional forms adopted are homogeous of degree ® in income, this amounts to …nding
the value of ¢ t such that (1 + ¢t)® VL = VSt where the local system is evaluated at its
steady state and the state system in period t.
If ® is negative (as our calibration procedure suggests), then preferred tax rates under
a state system are increasing in income (under a local system, as noted previously, they
are independent of income) and only equal to the local tax rate for those individuals with
income such that yi = ¹. Since the median voter’s income is lower than mean income,
it follows that the tax rate will be lower under the state system than the (identical) tax
rate chosen by each income group under the local system. This implies that in the …rst
period, given that the income distribution is the same as in the local system, aggregate
spending on education will decrease.
The table below shows the tax rate, mean and median income in the steady state
of state …nance regime. The last two columns report the …rst period gain in aggregate
welfare (i.e., prior to the change in mean income) which we denote by ¢1 and the
steady-state gain in aggregate welfare, denoted ¢1. Despite the fact that for ® strictly
negative spending on education will decrease in the …rst period of reform (relative to its
value in the local system), we …nd that steady-state mean income is always higher than
in the local steady state. Furthermore, aggregate welfare increases in period 1 as well
as in every subsequent period relative to the initial local …nance system steady state.39
38
Note that this is equivalent to a utilitarian welfare measure or one chosen “b ehind the veil of
ignorance” (i.e., an individual’s welfare if her parents were a random draw from the income distribution
in that system).
39
The new steady state is typically reached in …ve p eriods.

As shown in the Table above, the …rst period gains are relatively small (around
1 percent).40 The steady-state gain is surprisingly constant across parameter values,
even though the tax rate is changing relative to the local steady state by as much as
10 percent.41 More generally, the “static” welfare gain might well be negative. In a
model with housing, for example, the unbundling of the education and residence decision
that a state system allows relative to a local system will in general imply an increase in
housing prices in relatively poorer communities and a decrease in wealthier ones. Thus,
lower-income individuals will end up paying higher property prices than previously, and
the transition to the new steady state may well involve some losses in early periods. In
the more complicated model studied by Fernández and Rogerson (1998), this change
in housing prices and the fact that agents preferred tax rates di¤er, implies a small
decrease (:3 percent) in aggregate welfare in the …rst period of the policy reform.
The more complicated analysis in Fernández and Rogerson (1998) gives rise to an
even starker illustration of di¤erences in short and long-run welfare. In that paper
spending on education a¤ects the mean (but not the variance) of the lognormal distribution from which individual income is assumed to be a random draw. Comparing
across steady states of a local relative to a state system of …nancing education, we …nd
that, given an individual’s income, each individual prefers a local system to a state
40

More generally, the “static” welfare gain might well be negative. In a model with housing, for
example, the unbundling of the education and residence decision that a state system allows relative
to a local system will in general imply an increase in housing prices in relatively poorer communities
and a decrease in wealthier ones. Thus, lower-income individuals will end up paying higher property
prices than previously, and the transition to the new steady state may well involve some losses in early
periods. In the more complicated model studied by Fernández and Rogerson (1998), this change in
housing prices and the fact that agents preferred tax rates di¤er, implies a small decrease (:3 percent)
in the …rst period of the policy reform.

system. However, an individual’s income is of course not the same across systems since
the probability with which any particular level is realized depends on spending on education, which in turn depends on the system of …nancing education. It is taking the
new distribution of income that results into account that yields a higher steady-state
welfare level under the state system.
Next I turn to an analysis based primarily on Benabou (1996). Consider an economy
populated by OLG dynasties indexed by i who spend some amount of time º working
and the remainder 1 ¡ º passing on education to their single child. The law of motion
for the evolution of future descendants’ human capital is given by
hit+1 = ·»it ((1 ¡ º )hit)± (Eti )1¡±

(2.16)

re‡ecting an inherited portion as given by hit (the parent’s human capital) and an
unpredictable portion given by an iid shock » it. The shock is assumed to be distributed
lognormally such that ln »it » N (¡s2=2; s2) and thus E(»it ) = 1. Formal schooling, Eit ,
is the other input into the production of next period’s human capital. This is …nanced
by taxing at rate ¿ the labor income of local residents. Hence,

where mit is the distribution of income (and Yti is its average) in the community ¤it to

The production sector is made up of competitive …rms with constant returns to
R
scale CES technology given by Yt = ( 01(xrt )(¾¡1)=¾dr)¾=(¾¡1) , ¾ > 1 where xrt denotes
intermediate input r. Each worker must specialize in an intermediate input. As there
are an in…nite number of inputs, and each faces a downward sloping demand curve for
its services, each worker will choose to specialize in a di¤erent intermediate input such
that r(i) = i and supply that input in the quantity xit = ºhit . Thus aggregate output
simpli…es to

In Benabou (1996), individuals choose how much time to spend work relative to educating their
children so as to maximize the discounted value of future generations log of consumption (the dynastic
utility function). Given the assumption of log preferences, all individuals choose the same º. They
also choose a constant value of ¿ . See the Appendix in Benabou (1996) for details.

where ¹ denotes the distribution of human capital in the entire labor force ¤. Note
that the complementarity between inputs in the production function implies that a
worker’s earnings depend both on her own human capital and on an economy-wide index of human capital, Ht . That is, yti = º(Ht )1=¾(hit )(¾¡1)=¾ . This interdependence
R
is also re‡ected in the per capita income of each community as Yti = 01 ydmit (y) =
R
º(Ht )1=¾( 01 h(¾¡1)=¾d¹it(h)) ´ ºHt1=¾(Lit )(¾¡1)=¾ where ¹it (h) is the distribution of human capital in the community ¤it.
Incorporating the de…nitions above into the law of motion for the evolution of human
capital (2.16) yields:
hit+1 = K»it (hit)® (Lit )¯(Ht )°
(2.19)
where K = ·(1¡º)± (º ¿)1¡± , ® = ±, ¯ = (1¡±)(¾ ¡1)=¾, and ° = (1¡±)=¾. Note that
this function exhibits constant returns to scale, i.e., ® + ¯ + ° = 1 and that the law of
motion incorporates a local linkage Lit because education is funded by local funds, and
a global linkage Ht because workers (the inputs) are complementary in production.
The relative merits of a local versus a state system of education can be studied in this
framework by comparing the bene…ts of a system in which individuals are completely
segregated into homogeneous jurisdictions such that Lit = hit with one in which all
communities are integrated and hence Lit = Ht.
Intuitively, the trade-o¤ between the two systems is clear. On the one hand, complementarity and symmetry of inputs in production suggests that total output is maximized
if individuals are homogeneous, pointing towards the bene…ts of a more homogenizing
system such as a state-…nanced one. On the other hand, the fact that parental human
capital and community resources are complements (i.e., the marginal return to an extra
dollar spent on formal education is increasing in the level of parental human capital),
suggests that at a local level assortative grouping of families is bene…cial. The relative
merits of the two systems, as we shall show, depend on the time horizon.
To analyze the pros and cons of the two systems, we need to derive the dynamic path
of the economy under each education-…nance policy. We do this under the assumption that the initial distribution of human capital at time t is lognormal, i.e., ln hit »
N(mt; ¢2t ). The cost of heterogeneity at both the local and global level then can be seen
in that H = (E[(h)(¾¡1)=¾ ])¾=(¾¡1) = e¡

implying that the drag on growth from heterogeneity is greater in a state-…nanced
system. That is, two economies that start out with the same distribution of human
capital in the …rst period will have a greater level of human capital in the second period
under a local regime than under a state …nance regime.
In the long-run, however, the conclusion is di¤erent. The handicap to growth from
heterogeneity under a state regime tends to get reduced, as individuals have access to the
same formal education system, whereas this source of heterogeneity is maintained under
a local system in which education funding depends on family human capital. Solving
for the long-run variances of the two systems given the same initial conditions yields:

initial endowments are the only source of inequality (i.e., s2 = 0), in the long run the
agents are substitutes in the production function or when the inputs of the community do not consist
solely of education funds but also, say, p eer e¤ects that on aggregate imply increasing returns to scale
in human capital at the local level.

3. Sorting into Schools
At some level it is possible simply to repeat much of the analysis of the preceding
sections but refer to schools rather than neighborhoods. Obviously little additional
insight would be gained by doing this. A topic which did not have a natural place in
the previous section is how the possibility of attending a private rather than a public
school matter.
Introducing private schooling in a model which includes public schooling is in general
problematic since in these models the funding of public schools is usually decided by
majority vote at the local level making it di¢cult to obtain existence of majority vote
equilibrium.45 The problem lies in the fact that those individuals who opt out of public
schooling prefer (in the absence of externalities) to provide zero funding for private
schools.
45

See, though Epple and Romano (1996), Fernández and Rogerson (1995) and Glomm and Ravikumar
(1998) for some related attempts.

29

Epple and Romano (1998) provide a model that allows one to study some of the
interactions between the private and public provision of education in an economy where
the demand for education depends both on ability and on income. They sidestep the
problem of funding for education by assuming that the quality of a school depends
only on the mean ability of its students. Although their theoretical results are somewhat incomplete given the di¢culty of characterizing equilibria in an economy in which
individuals di¤er in more than one dimension, their model nonetheless provides an extremely useful framework to begin thinking about sorting into schools.46 The rest of
this section is primarily dedicated to a discussion of their model.47
Consider an economy in which students are assumed to di¤er in ability b and in
income y. A school’s quality is determined solely by the mean ability, q, of the student
body. Student’s care about the quality of the school as their utility depends on their
achievement a, a function of their own ability b and school quality. They also care about
private consumption which will equal their income minus the price p they pay for schooling. Public schools are free and …nanced (so that costs are covered) by proportional
income tax rates, t. Letting yt denote after tax income, individuals maximize:
V = V (yt ¡ p; a(q; b))

(3.1)

The authors characterize the equilibrium distribution of student types (y; b) across
public and private schools assuming that types are veri…able. Preferences are assumed
to be single crossing in income in the (q; p) plane, i.e., (2.2) holds. That implies that,
for the same ability level, students with higher income will be willing to pay a higher
price to attend a school with higher mean³ability.
¯
´Preference for quality is also assumed

to be non-decreasing in ability; that is,

@b
All schools have the same cost function consisting of a …xed cost and an increasing,
convex variable cost in the number N of students c(N). Public schools all o¤er the same
quality schooling. The number of public schools simply minimizes the cost of operating
the public sector which is …nanced by a proportional income tax on all households.
Private-sector schools, on the other hand, maximize pro…ts and there is free entry and
46

Furthermore, for the interesting case of Cobb-Douglas preferences, their characterization holds as
will be discussed later.
47
See also Caucutt (forthcoming) for a discussion of how di¤erent p olicies matter when students sort
(in a complex fashion) across schools by ability and income.

30

exit.
Private schools maximize pro…ts taking as given the competitive utility V ¤ (y; b) the
student could obtain elsewhere. Schools can condition prices on ability and income.
Thus, the pro…t maximization problem of a private school is to choose prices as a
function of ability and income and the proportion of each type of student it wishes to
admit (recognizing that there is a limit to the number of students of each type) taking
into account the e¤ects that these choices have on school quality and on cost via the
types and number of students admitted.
The solution to private school’s j’s maximization problem is characterized by a …rst
order condition that, for an interior solution for that student type, equates the e¤ective
marginal cost of admitting the additional student i of type (bi; yi) to its reservation
price. Note that when a school admits a student with ability bi , its quality changes
b ¡q
by iNj j . The e¤ective marginal cost of admitting this student is thus the increase in
cost c0 (N ) resulting from the fact that an additional student is being admitted minus
the change in marginal revenue due to that student’s e¤ect on the school’s quality.48
The reservation price of a particular type of student is given by the maximum price
p¤i the school can charge (given its quality) so as to leave the individual at her market
utility. Note that this implies that some student types will not be admitted since their
reservation price is too low to cover their e¤ective marginal cost.
The equilibrium that emerges from this model has some nice properties.49 As shown
in Figure 2, there will be a strict hierarchy of school qualities qn > qn¡1 > ::: > q0, with
the public sector (denoted by j = 0) having the lowest-ability peer group. De…ne
the boundary loci between two schools as the set of types who are indi¤erent between
the two schools (a curve with zero measure). Students who are on the boundary loci
between two private schools will be charged their e¤ective marginal costs; all other
students will be charged strictly more than their e¤ective marginal costs. This follows
from the fact that students on the boundary are indi¤erent between attending either
of the two schools competing for them, which drives down the price that each school
can charge to that ability type’s e¤ective marginal cost. Furthermore, since a type’s
48
Thus the e¤ective marginal cost can be negative for a relatively high-ability student leading to the
possiblity of negative prices (e.g. fellowships) in equilibrium.
49
”Epple, Newlon, and Romano (forthcoming) adapt this model to study ability tracking (or streaming) in public and private schools. Epple and Romano (1999) use a modi…ed version of the model to
study voucher design.

31

e¤ective marginal cost is independent of income, their price will only depend on their
ability. For students within the boundary loci, on the other hand, the fact that they
are not indi¤erent over which school they attend leaves the school with some monopoly
power which the school exploits by increasing the price. Hence, in general, the price
charged to students within a school’s boundary loci will depend both on ability and
income. Note though that competition and free entry among schools implies that a
school’s pro…t is equal to zero.50
Lastly, it is also possible to characterize the type of students that will attend each
school in equilibrium. The single-crossing condition in income ensures that if an individual with income yi attends a school with quality qj , then all individuals with the
same ability but greater income will attend schools of at least that level of quality and
all individuals with lower income will attend schools with no greater quality.51
Thus, this model yields strati…cation by income. Strati…cation by ability need not
follow, although the authors are able to …nd conditions (unfortunately on equilibrium
variables) such that schools will also be strati…ed by ability.52 Note that, as public
schools have the lowest quality level, they will be composed of low-income individuals.
If strati…cation by quality also holds, then public schools will consist of the lowest income
and lowest ability students.
To understand the normative implications of the model, …rst suppose that no public
option exists. Given the number of private schools, the allocation of types into schools
is Pareto e¢cient. This is because private schools internalize the ability externality
in their choices and there is perfect price discriminate over income income. The equilibrium number of school is not generally e¢cient, however, because the …nite size of
schools implies entry externalities. Furthermore, public sector schooling in this model
in general implies Pareto ine¢ciency even given the equilibrium number of schools. Zero
pricing by public schools independently of ability implies that the allocation of types
50

As usual with model with …xed costs, free entry does not imply zero pro…ts due to the integer
problem. We will ignore that quali…cation here.
51
This prop erty of equilibrium does not follow immediately from single-crossing since schools can
discriminate by types and thus a higher quality school may charge an individual with higher income a
higher price. This behavior, however, will not disrupt income strati…cation because e¤ective marginal
cost depends only on ability and schools are sure to attract all types willing to paymore than e¤ective
marginal cost.
52
In their working paper (1993), Epple and Romano show that for a Cobb-Douglas speci…cation of
utilty U = (yt ¡ p)a(q; b) the equilibrium yields strati…cation by ability.

32

among public and private sector schools is ine¢cient.53
A very di¤erent issue in sorting into schools is studied by Fernández and Gali (1999).
This paper is primarily interested in the properties of di¤erent assignment mechanisms
under borrowing constraints. They examine a perfectly competitive model in which
schools that vary in their (exogenous) quality each charge a market-clearing price to
agents who vary in their ability and income. Schools have a …xed capacity and agents
are assumed to be unable to borrow. In this model, the assumption that ability a and
school quality q are complements in the production of output x (a; q) implies that a
social planner (or perfect capital markets) would assign the highest ability student to
the highest quality school, the next highest ability student to the next highest quality
school and so forth. A perfectly competitive pricing mechanism does not produce this
outcome. Instead, lower ability but higher income individuals are able to outbid higher
ability but lower income agents for a place in a high quality school.
This equilibrium outcome above is contrasted with an exam mechanism that assigns
students to school based on their performance on the exam. The exam score is assumed
to be an increasing function of expenditures on education (e.g., better preparation, tutors, etc.) and innate ability. The exam technology is such that the marginal increment
in expenditure required to increase a given score is decreasing in ability.
The authors …nd that an exam mechanism will always produce greater output. However, as expenditures under an exam system are wasteful, aggregate consumption need
not be higher. The authors show, nonetheless, that for a su¢ciently powerful exam
technology (one that is su¢ciently sensitive to ability relative to expenditures), the exam
mechanism will always dominate the market mechanism for both aggregate production
and consumption.

4. Household Sorting
People sort not only into neighborhoods and schools, they also at the household level by
deciding whom to “marry” or more generally who to match with. Although there is a
small literature that analyzes the economics of matching (e.g. Becker (1973) and Burdett
and Coles (1997)), there has been very little analysis, empirical or theoretical, of how
53

See Epple and Romano (1998) for a fuller discussion.

33

this interacts with other general equilibrium variables such as growth and inequality.54
What are the consequences of household sorting for the transmission of education
and inequality? Following Fernández and Rogerson (2001b), I will set down a rudimentary model that allows us to examine this issue. This model will leave exogenous several
important features of the decision problem (such as who to match with and fertility),
but it will simplify the analysis of key features of the transmission process.55
Consider an OLG model with two types of individuals–skilled (s) and unskilled (u)–
in which the level of skill is also synonymous with the level of education (college and
non-college respectively). These individuals meet, match, have children, and decide how
much education to give each of their children.
Given a population at time t whose number is given by Nt and some division of that
population into skilled workers, Nst , and unskilled workers, Nut, where Nt = Nst + Nut ,
let ¯ denote the fraction of the population that is skilled, i.e., ¯ t = NNstt . Rather than
endogenize matches, we assume an exogenous matching process in which a fraction µ of
the population matches with probability one with someone of the same type, whereas
the remainder match at random. As there are two types of individuals, this gives rise
to three types of household matches indexed by j which we shall denote by high (h)
when it is between two skilled, middle (m) when the match is between a skilled and an
unskilled, and low (l) between two unskilled.
The matching process speci…ed above yields ¸ht ´ µ¯ t + (1 ¡ µ)¯ 2t as the fraction
of matches that are high, ¸mt ´ 2(1 ¡ µ)¯ t (1 ¡ ¯ t) as the fraction of matches that are
middle, and ¸lt ´ µ(1 ¡ ¯ t ) + (1 ¡ µ)(1 ¡ ¯ t)2 as the fraction that are low. Of course,
¸ht + ¸mt + ¸lt = 1. Note that µ equals the correlation of partners’ education levels.
Families have n = f0; 1; :::ng children. We allow the probability Ánj with which
they have a particular number n to depend on the family type, so that average fertility
n
¹
P
f for a family of type j is given by fj =
nÁnj .
n=0

Children are either “college material” (whereupon if they went to college they would
become a skilled worker) or they are not and sending them to college would still produce
an unskilled worker. We denote these types as either high or low “aptitude” and allow
54

Some exceptions are Cole, Mailath, and Postlewaite (1992) and Kremer (1997).
See Fernández, Guner and Knowles (2000) and Fernández and Pissarides (2000) for models that
endogenize several of these features.
55

34

the probability °j that a child is of high aptitude to depend on her parental type.56 If
a high aptitude child is sent to college, she earns the skilled wage, ws; otherwise she
earns the unskilled wage wu.
Lastly, we come to the education decision. We assume that the cost of college is
given by º > 0. Capital and insurance markets are imperfect in that parents cannot
borrow to …nance the college education of their children but must …nance it from their
earnings. Insurance (as to which type of child a family might have) is also assumed not
to be available. The assumption of not being able to borrow for a college education is
not necessarily meant to be taken literally. Rather we have in mind the local primary
and secondary education system described earlier whereby education is …nanced to a
large extent at the local level and minimum lot sizes (or higher borrowing costs), for
example, constrain the quality of education that less wealthy parents are able to give
to their children.
Parents choose per family member consumption level c and the number, r, of their
high-aptitude children to educate so as to maximize the utility function below:
U=

(

(c ¡ c) +

(c ¡ c)

(4.1)

implying that subject to a minimum per family member consumption level of c, parents
will send a high-ability child to college if they can a¤ord to (and it is economically
advantageous to do so). The family budget constraint is given by (2+n)c +rº · Ij (¯),
0 · r · a, where a is the total number of high aptitude children the family has, and

(4.2)

Lastly, wages are determined in a competitive market as the appropriate marginal
56

One should consider aptitude to re‡ect family background in the sense of making it more probable
that a child will obtain a college education. It should be noted that this is not really standing in for a
genetically determined process since in that case we would have to keep track of whether a particular
match consisted of 0, 1, or 2 high-aptitude individuals.

(4.3)

Hence, wages are solely a function of ¯ and given by ws (¯) = (1¡¯)2 f 0 (¯) and wu(¯) =
f (¯) ¡ ¯(1 ¡ ¯)f 0 (¯). Note that (4.3) implies that skilled wages are decreasing in the
ratio of skilled to unskilled workers whereas unskilled wages are increasing. Also note
that no family would want to send their child to college if the fraction of skilled workers
exceeds ¯, where ¯ is de…ned by ws (¯) = wu(¯) + º.
To solve for the steady states we need one additional piece of information, ¡j (zj (¯)),
the average proportion of children sent to college by families of type j. This will depend
on how constrained each family is (this may di¤er according to family size and how many
high aptitude children they have), znj, which in turn depends on wages and hence on
¯. Hence,

with n children.57

< 1.

¯ t= b̄

Note that in general there may be multiple steady states. To see why this is so,
consider what may happen if we start out with a low level of ¯. In this case, low type
families (and perhaps middle types as well) will be relatively constrained since unskilled
wages are low. Thus, this will tend to perpetuate a situation in which ¯ is low next
period as well and thus a steady state with a low proportion of unskilled wages (and
high inequality). If, on the other hand, the economy started out with a high level
of ¯, unskilled wages would be high and hence low type families would be relatively
unconstrained, perpetuating a situation of high ¯ (and low inequality).
How does the degree of sorting a¤ect this economy? If the change in sorting is
su¢ciently small that the degree to which constraints are binding is una¤ected (i.e., the
¡j ’s are constant), then

requires D > 0.
The expression in (4.6) is easy to sign for a few cases. Suppose all the ¡j ’s are
the same, i.e., ¡j = ¡. In that case, b̄ = ¡ and the extent of sorting does not a¤ect
the personal income distribution (though it does the household income distribution) as
wages are unchanged.58
Suppose next that average fertility is the same across all groups, i.e., fj = f . In
this case, the sign of (4.6) is given by the sign of ¡h + ¡l ¡ 2¡ m. The intuition behind
this is simple. Note that the e¤ect of an increase in sorting is to destroy middle-type
matches and replace these by high and low ones. In particular, for every two middle
matches destroyed, one high and one low match are created. Since average fertility is
the same across family types, the e¤ect of increased sorting depends on whether the
fraction of children sent to college on average by two middle-type marriages (2¡m ) is
58

Recall that we are assuming that constraints are una¤ected by the change in sorting.

37

smaller than the combined fraction of children that go to college on average in one high
and one low type family (¡h + ¡l ). Thus, if the relationship between parents’ education
and children’s education is linear, changes in sorting will have no e¤ect on b̄ ; if concave,
increased sorting will decrease b̄ ; and the reverse if the relationship is convex.
Lastly, making no assumptions about fertility or the ¡j ’s, a su¢cient condition for
an increase in sorting to decrease b̄ is fh ¡h ¡ 2fm ¡m + fl ¡l · 0 and fh + fl ¡ 2fm ¸ 0
(with at least one inequality strict). The …rst expression is the counterpart of the
expression in the preceding paragraph. That is, subject to no change in population
growth it ensures that there will be fewer skilled individuals in the following period.
The second expression ensures that the population growth rate will not decline as a
result of the increased sorting (thereby potentially giving rise to a larger proportion of
skilled people despite the fall in their growth rate).59
The above discussion assumed that the ¡j ’s remained invariant to the change in
sorting. Note, however, that these may well change as constraints become more or less
binding as a result of the change in wages.60 Hence, even if fertility is exogenous, the
sign of fh ¡h ¡ 2fm¡ m + fl ¡l is in general endogenous since the ¡j ’s are endogenous
variables. 61 Thus, whether the expression is concave or convex may itself depend on ¯.
Fernández and Rogerson (2001b) explore the e¤ect of increased sorting on inequality
by calibrating the model above to US data. They use the PSID to obtain a sample
of parents and children and group all individuals with high school and below into the
unskilled category and everyone who has had at least some college into skilled. The
correlation of parental education (µ) equals :6. Average fertility is given by fh = 1:84,
fm = 1:90, and f l = 2:26 (from PSID and Mare (1997)). For any average fertility
number, the two integers that bracket the average are chosen as the only two possible
number of children to have, with the appropriate weights used as the probabilities (e.g.,
Á1h = :16; Á2h = :84).
To calibrate the model, we need to know the °j ’s. These are not available in the
data but what is computable from the PSID are the ¡j ’s (i.e., the fraction of children
59

¯.

The opp osite signs on the two expressions is a su¢cient condition for increased sorting to increase

60

In a more general model where household incomes were continuous, then a change in µ that a¤ected
¯ for a constant set of ¡’s, would also necessarily a¤ect the ¡j ’s.
61
In a more complex model in which fertility and/or matching are endogenized, then one can perform
a similar exercise by changing technology such that the skill premium for any ¯ is higher or by changing
the cost of search.

of each family type that on average attend college). These are given by ¡h = :81,
¡m = :63, and ¡l = :30. Note from (4.4) that any value of ¡j can be decomposed
into an assumption about how “inheritable” education is (the °j ’s) and a corresponding
assumption about how binding borrowing constraints are (the znj ’s). The table below
shows various such decompositions for ¡ l (for the other ¡j ’s it is assumed that the
constraints are not binding and hence ¡ j = °j ).

Fernández and Rogerson (2001b) use the second column as their benchmark. Note
that this implies the existence of very mild constraints. Only low-type families with
three high-ability children are a¤ected and these are fewer than 1 percent of low-type
families.
This information along with the ¡ j’s allows us to compute the steady state, yielding
b̄ = :60. To obtain wages, we use a CES production function y = A[bNs½ + (1 ¡
1
b)Nu½ ] ½ and match the steady-state ratio of skill to unskilled wages to 1:9 (Katz and
Murphy (1992)) and obtain ½ = :33 by matching an elasticity of substitution between
skilled and unskilled workers of 1:5 (see survey by Katz and Autor (1999)). Lastly,
for ease of interpretation of our results, we choose a value of A to scale steady-state
unskilled wages to some “reasonable” value, which we set to be 30; 000. This is purely
a normalization.
It is important to note that the steady-state of the calibrated model ful…lls the
su¢cient conditions such that an increased µ leads to a lower proportion of skilled
individuals. Hence, from a theoretical perspective, we know that an increase in sorting
will lead to higher skilled waged and lower unskilled ones. The quantitative impact
is given in the table below. The …rst row reports mean years of education (in which
the skilled group and unskilled group have been assigned the mean from their PSID
sample). The second row gives the coe¢cient of variation of education. The last

39

entry is the standard deviation in log income–our measure of inequality in the personal
income distribution.
The …rst column of the table reports the result of the calibration.62 The second
column reports the e¤ect of an increase in sorting to :7 assuming that the values of
¡ are unchanged. The third column does the same but assumes that the decrease in
the unskilled wage means constraints are tightened for low-type families and that those
with three children can only a¤ord to send a maximum of one of them to college.

The main message of the table above is that changes in sorting can have large e¤ects
on inequality and that seemingly small changes in average years of education or in its
coe¢cient of variation can underlie large changes in the income distribution. As shown
in the table, a change in sorting from :6 to :7 will increase the standard deviation of
log income by a bit under 5 percent in the absence of any assumption about borrowing
constraints.63 If as a result of the approximately $600 drop in wu that results (and
consequently a $1200 drop in low-type family income) constraints tighten, this leads to
an increase in inequality of almost 15 percent. In both cases, the e¤ect on the standard
deviation of log family income is large: 8:3 percent and 19 percent respectively.64
62

Note that the standard deviation of log income is about half of what it is in reality for the US. It
is not surprising that our model is not able to produce as much variation as in the data as there are
only two wages.
63
Note that these results, therefore, are independent of which column we choose from Table ?? as our
benchmark.
64
The results for the µ increase to :8 follow a pattern similar to the one above. The change in the
mean and standard deviation of the education distribution are small, as before but the change in income
distribution are large.

40

The analysis above also points out the dangers with assuming intergenerational
processes are linear. Kremer (1997), for example, assumes that the years of education
a child acquires is a linear function of average parental years of education as given by:
ei;t+1 = · + ®

(ei;t + ei0 ;t)
+ »i
2

(4.7)

where ei;t+1 is the education level for the child, ei;t and ei0 ;t are the education levels of
the two parents, and » is a normally distributed random shock that is iid across families,
with mean 0 and standard deviation equal to ¾» . Parents are all assumed to have two
kids and an (exogenous) assortative matching of individuals takes place yielding µ as
the correlation between the education levels of parents.
Note that within the framework of Fernández and Rogerson (2001b), the assumptions
of a linear transmission process and the same fertility across all parent types would yield
no e¤ect of an increase in sorting on inequality. In Kremer’s model, this is not the case
as although the mean of the distribution is una¤ected, the inclusion of a shock implies
that greater sorting will increase inequality. To see this, note that with constant
parameter values the distribution of education converges to a normal distribution with
· and
steady state mean and standard deviation given by ¹1 = 1¡®
¾1 =

[1 ¡

¾»
+ µ)=2]:5

®2 (1

(4.8)

respectively. Thus an increase in µ while not a¤ecting the mean, increases the variance
of the distribution of education.
To investigate the e¤ects of sorting within this model, Kremer uses PSID data to run
the regression suggested by (4.7), and …nds ® equals :4. Parents’ correlation in years
of education, as we saw previously is :6. This implies, using (4.8), that even a large
increase in the correlation of parental education, say from :6 to :8 will only increase the
standard deviation of the distribution of education by about 1 percent. Furthermore,
if we assume as Kremer does that log earnings are linear in years of education (i.e.,
yi;t+1 = a + bei;t+1), then exactly the same conclusion applies to the distribution of
earnings.
The very di¤erent conclusions obtained by Kremer relative to Fernández and Rogerson emphasize that importance of certain features of the data (i.e. fertility di¤erentials
41

and non-convexities in the transmission process) as well as the endogeneity of wages.
Furthermore, as shown in Fernández and Rogerson, borrowing constraints can greatly
multiply the magnitude of any e¤ect of increased sorting that takes the shape of the
transmission process as given, rather than endogenous.
In light of the above, it is of interest to ask how inequality, fertility and sorting
are related in a model in which these variables are endogenous. Fernández, Guner
and Knowles (2000) develop a simple two-period search model in which individuals are
given multiple opportunities to match with others. As before, there are two types of
individuals (skilled and unskilled) distinguished only by their educational attainment.
In the …rst period we assume that agents meet others from the population in general.
In the second period agents meet only others who are similar to themselves in terms of
skill level.65 Agents characteristics (income) are fully observable, as is the quality of
the match. The latter is assumed to be a random draw from a quality distribution,
and is fully match speci…c. If agents decide to keep their …rst period match, they are
unable to search in the second period.
Having matched, individuals decide how many children to have (at a cost per child
t that is proportional to income I) and devote the rest of their income to consumption.
Thus individuals maximize:
max [c + ° log(n) + K + q] ;
c;n

(4.9)

subject to
c · I(1 ¡ tn); t > 0;
where n is the number of children, I > ° is household income, q is the quality of the
match and K is a constant. Plugging in the optimal decisions for an individual (and
choosing K such that the sum of the constants is zero) allows us to express the indirect
utility function as V (I; q) = I ¡ ° log I + q.
Assuming a constant returns production function allows us as before to express
wages solely as a function of the ratio of skilled to unskilled workers and to express
household income as in (4.2). The cuto¤ match quality that a high wage worker will
accept in order to match with a low wage individual in the …rst period is an increasing
65

One could just as easily simply assume that the …rst period one meets a more representative sample
of the population relative to the second period in which it is biased towards individuals who are similar.

42

function of ws and a decreasing function of wu .66
Children face two costs to becoming a skilled worker. First, there is a constant
monetary cost of d. Second, there is an individual-speci…c (additive) psychic cost
(e.g., e¤ort) of ± with a cumulative distribution ª(±). The return to being a skilled
worker is the probability of matching with a skilled worker and obtaining household
income Iss (in which wages are assumed to be net borrowing and repaying d) plus the
probability of matching with an unskilled worker and obtaining household income Isu.
These probabilities depend on the probability that in the …rst period a particular type
of worker is met and on the cuto¤ quality of the match a skilled worker will accept (and
hence on the fraction of individuals that are skilled in the population, i.e., ¯). A similar
calculation holds for the return to being an unskilled worker.67
If there were no borrowing constraints, then all families would have the same fraction
of children become skilled so that the net return to being a skilled worker equalled that
the return to being an unskilled worker plus ±¤(¯) (the equilibrium psychic cost such
that no worker with ±i > ±¤(¯) is willing to become skilled). If, however, there are
borrowing constraints such that the amount that an individual can borrow depends
(positively) on family income, then families with higher household income will have a
higher fraction of their children become skilled.
How does inequality matter? It is easy to show that as family income increases,
fertility declines. Thus fertility di¤erentials are increasing with inequality. Furthermore, as wage inequality increases, skilled workers become pickier about the quality of
the match required to make them willing to match with an unskilled worker.
As before, this model will in general have multiple steady states. If the economy
starts out with a low proportion of skilled workers, the skill premium will be high,
skilled workers will be very picky about matching with unskilled workers, and hence
there will be a high level of sorting. Given borrowing constraints, only a small fraction
of children from low-income households will become skilled implying that in the next
period a similar situation will tend to perpetuate itself–a high level of inequality, high
sorting, and high fertility di¤erentials. The opposite would be true if instead the
economy starts out with a high level of skilled workers. In this case inequality is low,
66
The skilled worker will always be the one whose cuto¤ quality level is binding as her income is
greater.
67
Note that unlike Fernández and Rogerson (2001b), the return to being skilled/unskilled depends
also on how this decision a¤ects the type of match one will obtain.

43

high-skilled agents choose a low cuto¤ quality for matching with unskilled agents so
sorting is low, fertility di¤erentials are low, and borrowing constraints are not very
binding. This leads again to a high proportion of skilled workers the following period.
We take the implications of this model to the data. Using a sample of thirty three
countries we examine the relationship between sorting and inequality and …nd that, as
the theory predicts, these are positively correlated. Countries with greater inequality
exhibit greater sorting at the household level. Furthermore, as also predicted by the
theory, fertility di¤erentials are increasing in inequality.68

5. Concluding Remarks
This chapter has reviewed some of the principal contributions to the literature that
examines the links between sorting, education and inequality. Much work remains to
be done in all of the areas discussed in this chapter: education …nance systems and
residential sorting, schools, and household sorting. In particular, it would be of interest
to see more work that examined how di¤erent education systems matter, and provided
an empirical basis on which to assess di¤erent policy proposals. At the school level, very
little is known about how parents, teachers, students, administrators and the community
interact in producing schooling of a particular quality. I think that the largest challenge
here is the creation of a convincing multiple principal-agent model that endogenizes the
quality of the school in response to information constraints, the availability of alternative
options, and the system in which it is embedded. In addition, it would be of interest to
study the incentive e¤ects of external standards (e.g. national or state level exams) that
allow schools to be “graded” against one another. Finally, work on household sorting
is still at an embryonic level, both theoretically and empirically.69 A notable omission
form the models discussed above is the role of gender: they do not distinguish between
the education and income distributions of men and women. It would be of interest to
examine how these matter and to investigate, empirically and theoretically, the role of
woman’s large increase in labor force participation and educational attainment.

68

Kremer and Chen (1999) examine the relationship between fertility and inequality for a large sample
of countries and …nd that fertility di¤erentials and inequality are positively correlated.
