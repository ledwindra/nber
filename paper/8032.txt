This paper provides a new analysis of a question of increasing importance and significant
controversy: the impact of 401(k) plans on households’ wealth. Deferred compensation, or 401(k), plans are
employment-based saving incentives featuring tax-deductible contributions by the employer and employee,
tax-free accrual of earnings, and annual contribution limits. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income and
may also be subject to penalties, depending on the age of the account holder. Originally authorized in 1978,
401(k) plans began to grow rapidly after regulations were issued in the early 1980s. In 1984, active 401(k)
participants numbered 7.5 million and aggregate contributions totaled $16 billion. By 1996, active
participants numbered almost 31 million, contributions were $104 billion and balances exceeded $1,061
billion (Department of Labor 2000). In short, 401(k) plans have become a major tax -preferred saving
vehicle over the last 15 to 20 years.
Over the same period, a growing literature on how 401(k) plans affect household saving has
emerged. The central issue addressed is simple: what proportion of 401(k) contributions or balances
represent net additions to national (private plus public) saving? Contributions raise private saving when
households finance the contributions with reductions in consumption or increases in labor supply. Private
saving also rises even if the contributions are financed by the associated tax cut; this emphasizes the
importance of considering the impact on both public and private saving. However, 401(k) plans do not raise
private saving when households finance contributions with reductions in existing assets, with saving that
would have been undertaken even in the absence of the plan, or with increases in debt. Moreover, the tax
breaks associated with 401(k)s tend to reduce public saving.
Although the central issue is straightforward, developing reliable and robust answers has proven
difficult for several reasons. First, saving behavior differs significantly across households. Evidence
indicates that households that participate in, or are eligible for, 401(k)s have systematically stronger tastes for
saving than other households. Second, the average taste for saving among eligible or ineligible households
may have shifted systematically over time. Finally, since the early 1980s, financial markets and underlying

1

economic factors have changed dramatically. The attempt to control for these three complicating factors has
been a major theme of previous work. Despite these efforts, previous research has reached a wide variety of
conclusions regarding 401(k)s and saving. Poterba, Venti, and Wise (1996a, page 92) conclude that
“...401(k) contributions represent new saving, rather than simply being a substitute for other financial asset
saving.” However, Engen, Gale and Scholz (1996, page 115) conclude that “...little, if any, of the overall
contributions to existing saving incentives have raised saving.”
This paper points the way toward a reconciliation of these findings. Our key modeling innovation is
to allow the impact of 401(k)s to vary simultaneously over both time and earnings groups. Previous work has
considered each item separately. Our specification generalizes models used in earlier research. We show that
the modeling constraints imposed in previous studies are soundly rejected by the data. Using data from 1987
and 1991, we find that the effects of 401(k)s on wealth vary significantly by earnings level. Our analysis
implies that 401(k)s held by groups with low earnings, who hold a small portion of overall 401(k) assets, are
more likely to represent net wealth than 401(k)s held by high-earnings groups, who hold the bulk of 401(k)
balances. We also find that 401(k)s held by homeowners or IRA holders, both of whom save substantial
amounts in other forms and who hold the bulk of 401(k) assets, are less likely to be new saving than are
401(k) balances held by renters or non-IRA holders. Thus, between 0 and 30 percent of 401(k) balances in
the sample period represent net additions to private saving.
In section I, we describe the data set used in this and previous work, and highlight several key
empirical patterns. Section II describes and critiques previous research. Section III develops our modeling
strategy. Section IV presents the main results. Sections V and VI examine a variety of extensions of the
basic results. Section VII provides concluding remarks and places the results in a broader context.

I. Data
Following previous research on 401(k)s, we use data from 1984, 1987, and 1991, available in the

2

Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), which is conducted by the Bureau of the Census.1 Our
sample includes only families where the reference person is 25-64 years old, at least one person is employed,
and no individual is self-employed.2 We use this group for several reasons. 401(k) plans are employmentbased and are typically unavailable to the self-employed. For people aged 65 and older, retirement issues
may complicate the analysis. SIPP questions about 401(k) plans are asked only of people aged 25 and older.
Also, we exclude households with inconsistent asset data.3 These criteria leave samples of 9,310 households
in 1984, 10,669 in 1987 and 10,266 in 1991.4
The SIPP is the only nationally representative survey with data on 401(k) eligibility and wealth
during the 1980s, when 401(k)s grew rapidly. But the SIPP has several shortcomings worth noting. First,
there is no information on 401(k) balances for 1984. Second, mortgage debt and house value are top coded.
Based on sensitivity analyses we have conducted, we believe that top coding does not have an important
influence on our results.5 Third, Curtin, Juster, and Morgan (1989) compare the SIPP wealth data to the

1

Households are interviewed several times over a period of about two and a half years. Every "wave"
collects core data on income, demographics, and other items. We use this information and data from periodic
topical modules with information on 401(k) plans, assets and debt. The 1984 SIPP wave 4 was undertaken
between September and December 1984. We refer to this as 1984 data. The 1985 SIPP wave 7 and the 1986
SIPP wave 4 surveys occurred between January and April 1987. Variables in these two samples have similar
distributions, so we pool these data sets to form our 1987 data. Interviews for the 1990 SIPP wave 4
occurred between February and May 1991; we refer to this as 1991 data.
2

The reference person is the person in whose name the family's home is owned or rented. If jointly owned
or rented, either spouse may appear as the reference person.
3

The SIPP records holdings of particular assets for each person in the household, and also provides
summary data at the household level for holdings of classes of assets. We exclude households for whom
these two sources of data do not match.
4

In 1991, the raw sample contained 20,329 families. The sample totaled 11,948 after excluding families
with no workers or with self-employed workers, 10,651 after excluding families with a reference person older
than 64 or younger than 25, and 10,266 after excluding those with inconsistent asset data. Similar patterns
occur for the other sample years. See Engen and Gale (1995, Appendix table 1).
5

The top code for mortgages is $100,000 in 1984 and 1987, and $150,000 in 1991. For house value, the
top code is $200,000 in 1984 and 1987, and $300,000 in 1991. Top coding affects only 3.3 percent or less
of the sample in each year.

Survey of Consumer Finances and the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. They conclude (p. 474) that the
"striking feature of these comparisons is the substantial similarity in the amounts and distribution of wealth
holdings across the three surveys--provided one ignores households with extremely high wealth (in excess of
$0.5 million)." High-income, high-wealth households are under represented in the SIPP. For analyzing
401(k)s, however, this limitation is not critical, because 401(k) eligibility is distributed widely across the
population and contributions are capped. But the under-representation of high-income households may
nevertheless prove important, if the effects of 401(k)s vary by earnings class. We return to this theme below.
We consider a family to be eligible for a 401(k) if either the reference person or the spouse works for
an organization that offers a 401(k) plan to its employees.6 Because our data lack information on 401(k)
contributions, a family is defined as a 401(k) participant if the reference person or spouse is eligible and has a
positive 401(k) balance. We define financial assets to include checking accounts, U.S. saving bonds, other
interest-earning accounts in banks and other financial institutions, other interest-earning assets (such as bonds
held personally), stocks and mutual funds, and IRA, Keogh, and 401(k) balances. Net financial assets are
defined as financial assets less unsecured debt. Housing equity is the defined as the difference between the
value of the primary residence and outstanding mortgage debt against the principal residence, including
second and third mortgages and home equity loans. We define wealth as the sum of housing equity and net
financial assets. This broad wealth measure omits business wealth, but since the sample excludes the selfemployed, this is a natural restriction to impose. The wealth measure also excludes defined benefit pension
rights and balances in non-401(k) defined contribution plans. We discuss the likely bias created by this
omission in subsequent sections. Family earnings are given by the sum of the reference person and, if
present, the spouse.

6

Strictly speaking, plans authorized by section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code are only available to
employees of for-profit firms that offer such plans. Employees of non-profit institutions and federal, state
and local governments are eligible for similar saving plans authorized under different section codes. In this
paper, we refer to all of these plans as 401(k)s.
4

With these definitions in mind, we highlight five patterns in the data to help motivate and frame the
analysis below. First, at each point in time, eligibility for 401(k)s rises substantially with family earnings
(table 1). Conditional on eligibility, participation rates also rise with earnings, but by smaller amounts. As a
result, the share of all families that participates in a 401(k) rises dramatically with family earnings. For
example, in 1991, 14 percent of families with earnings between $10,000 and $20,000 participated in a
401(k), compared to 51 percent of families with earnings above $75,000. The wide divergence in 401(k)
participation patterns suggests the impact of 401(k) eligibility on wealth may vary across earnings classes.
Second, eligibility and participation rates rose significantly between 1984 and 1991 (table 1). About
15 percent of families in the sample were eligible in 1984, rising to 38 percent by 1991. Over the same
period, the proportion of all families participating rose from 8.5 percent to 27 percent. The rapid expansion
in 401(k) coverage and participation raises questions regarding the comparability of samples of eligible and
ineligible households at a point in time and over time.
Third, 401(k) balances are concentrated among the highest earners and families that save in non401(k) forms (table 2). In 1991, about 70 percent of 401(k) balances and saving incentive balances (the sum
of 401(k)s, IRAs, and Keoghs) were held by households with earnings above $40,000. Households that have
IRAs or Keoghs held over half of 401(k) balances and 75 percent of saving incentive balances. Homeowners
held 88 percent of 401(k) balances and the same percentage of saving incentive balances. This suggests that
the effect of 401(k)s among high-income and high-saver households will be a crucial determinant of the
aggregate effect of 401(k)s on wealth.
Fourth, eligible households as a group have very different economic characteristics than ineligible
households as a group at a point in time. In 1984, for example, median earnings among eligible families
were almost $41,000 (in 1991 dollars), compared to only $28,000 among ineligible families. Table 3 shows
that about 52 percent of eligible families had earnings above $40,000, compared to 27 percent of ineligible
families. Median net financial assets were $3,500 for eligibles and $350 for ineligibles, and median wealth

5

was over $47,000 for eligibles and below $21,000 for ineligibles. These differences suggest that ineligible
households as a group may not be a good control group for eligible households. An economic shock that had
differential effects across earnings groups would also have differential effects on eligibles as a group relative
to ineligibles. Thus, it could be mis-interpreted as an effect of 401(k)s.
There are other systematic differences between eligibles and ineligibles as a group in 1984 (table 3).
Among eligibles, 77 percent owned their homes, 75 percent were married, and 33 percent had an IRA or
Keogh plan. Among ineligible households, the corresponding figures were markedly lower: 63 percent, 64
percent, and 22 percent. Similar differences occur in 1987 and 1991. These differences reinforce the notion
that the groups of eligible and ineligible households have different characteristics and that ineligibles as a
group are a poor control for eligibles as a group.
Fifth, after controlling for earnings, however, eligible households are much more similar to
ineligible households at a given point in time and over time (table 3). Average earnings, of course, are
essentially the same within earnings categories for eligibles relative to ineligibles in a given year. Within
earnings groups, the average difference between eligibles and ineligibles in 1984 in the likelihood of owning
an IRA or Keogh or a home is only one-fourth to one-half as large as the difference between the groups as a
whole. The average difference in marital status is essentially zero. Similar patterns also hold for later years
in the sample.
These findings suggest that although the characteristics of the overall sample of eligibles and
ineligibles are different at a point in time and have changed over time, the characteristics of the two groups
within earnings classes are much more similar--though clearly not identical--and have changed in much
smaller and less systematic ways over time. This suggests that ineligible households in a particular earnings
class may be a good control group for eligible households in the same earnings class.
II. Previous Research
Because our econometric specification is an effort specifically to resolve problems found in earlier

6

work, we highlight key aspects of earlier work here and summarize the findings in table 4. The effects of
401(k)s on saving are surveyed more broadly in Bernheim (1997, 1999), Engen, Gale and Scholz (1996a,
1996b), Hubbard and Skinner (1996), and Poterba, Venti and Wise (1996a, 1996b).
A. Analysis of cross-section data
A key issue in the analysis of 401(k) plans is how best to control for heterogeneity in tastes for
saving across different groups and over time that may be correlated with 401(k) eligibility and participation.
One approach to this problem has been to use cross-sectional variation in eligibility for 401(k)s. In this test,
the effects of 401(k)s are identified by the assumption that 401(k) eligibility is uncorrelated with tastes for
saving, after controlling for certain factors. If eligibility is exogenous with respect to tastes for saving, then
higher financial assets for eligibles relative to ineligibles would imply that 401(k)s raise saving.
Poterba, Venti and Wise (1995) test for the exogeneity of eligibility with respect to tastes for saving,
after controlling for earnings. They use the 1984 SIPP cross-section of eligibles and ineligibles and estimate
a median regression of the form:

(1)

Wj

' " % Xj$ % E6k'2(( k(Yjk) % E6k'1(* k(Yjk(ELIGj) % u j.

In this specification, W is financial assets excluding 401(k)s and IRAs, X includes dummies for age group,
educational attainment, and marital status, Yk indexes the same earnings groups as in tables 1-3, ELIG is an
indicator for 401(k) eligibility, and j indexes households.
They find that the coefficients *k in (1) are economically small and statistically insignificant. They
interpret this result as showing that eligible and ineligible households had similar tastes for saving in 1984, at
the outset of the 401(k) program, and therefore that eligibility is exogenous with respect to tastes for saving
in each earnings category. They then employ cross-sectional regressions for 1987 and 1991 to show that, in
each earnings category, eligible households in those years held more total financial assets than ineligibles did

7

and did not have lower levels of non-saving incentive financial assets. They conclude that 401(k)s were net
additions to wealth.
The advantage of this test is its simplicity. But there are several problems, too. Most importantly,
the test compares the wrong set of assets. The appropriate way to determine whether eligible and ineligible
households have similar tastes for saving requires a comparison of (a) the wealth of ineligible households and
(b) the wealth of eligible households if they had not been eligible. For example, if z is the proportion of
401(k) balances that would have been saved even in the absence of the program, then the correct wealth
measure to use for eligible households in the test above is the sum of non-401(k) wealth plus z times the
household’s 401(k) balances. Poterba, Venti, and Wise implicitly assume that z is equal to zero. That is,
they assume that all 401(k) balances are net saving. Clearly, this creates a bias in favor of understating the
correlation between eligibility and tastes for saving and overstating the effects of 401(k)s on saving.7
A second concern is that the Poterba, Venti, and Wise (1995) test ignores non-401(k) pension
wealth. In preliminary work, Engelhardt (1999) uses the 1992 Health and Retirement Study and replicates
the finding that eligible households hold more total financial assets than ineligibles. However, he also finds
that once non-401(k) pension wealth is included, there is no significant difference in the wealth of eligible and
ineligible households by earnings category. These and other concerns (see Bernheim and Garrett 1995 and
Engen, Gale, and Scholz 1996a, 1996) suggest that, although controlling for earnings at a point in time
makes eligible and ineligible households look more similar than otherwise, it does not provide sufficient
control to remove all residual differences in tastes for saving.8

7

A potential response to this criticism is that, at the beginning of the 401(k) program in 1984, typical
401(k) were likely to be small. This response, however, ignores an important fact: most early 401(k)s were
not new plans per se, but rather conversions of long-standing after-tax thrift plans. Thus, for example, in the
1983 Survey of Consumer Finances, the median balance in thrift plans among participants was $3,700
(Engen, Gale and Scholz 1996b).
8

Benajmin (2000) uses the 1991 SIPP to estimate the cross-sectional effects of 401(k) eligibility on wealth
controlling for a very long list of economic and demographic characteristics. His results are discussed in
detail later in the paper.
8

B. Tests using Successive cross-sections of “Like families” or “Similar saver groups”
(1) Tests Comparing Financial Assets Over Time for Eligible Families Only
Poterba, Venti, and Wise (1995) propose a second approach as well. This test compares how asset
balances evolve over time for successive cross-sections of “similar savers”--for example, eligible households.
In this test, the effects of 401(k)s are identified by the assumption that the only significant difference between
the samples of eligible households in earlier and later years is that eligible households in later years have had
increased years of exposure to 401(k)s (and IRAs). Thus, if eligible households in later years have higher
financial assets than those in earlier years, controlling for household characteristics, the conclusion would be
that 401(k)s raise saving.
To implement this test, Poterba, Venti, and Wise use the sample of eligible households only in 1984,
1987, and 1991, and specify an equation of the form:

(2)

Wj

' "E % Xj$E % E6K'2((Ek(Yjk) % *E84(IN84j % *E91(IN91j % uEj.

In this specification, X and Y are defined as in (1), and IN84 and IN91 are indicator variables showing
whether the household is in the 1984 or 1991 samples, respectively. At the risk of oversimplifying, the main
findings are: when W represents non-saving incentive financial assets, *E84 and *E91 are approximately zero;
when W represents total financial assets, *E91 is positive and significant (and the 1984 sample is excluded due
to missing 401(k) balance data). Given the identifying restrictions, these results suggest that 401(k)s raise
private saving and do not reduce other saving.
A significant advantage of this approach is that it does not require that eligibles and ineligibles have
similar tastes for saving. However, there are problems, too. First, the test assumes that average tastes for
saving among eligible households are constant over time. In fact, average tastes could have risen or fallen
among eligibles and thus biased the test in either direction. We investigate this issue in section V.

Second, the identifying restriction that no other relevant factors changed between 1984 and 1991 is
simply implausible. Briefly, during this period, the stock market boomed, real interest rates were high
relative to previous years, social security benefits were cut back significantly in the 1983 reforms, and defined
benefit pension coverage fell significantly (see Engen, Gale and Scholz 1996a). In addition, the decline in
inflation and in marginal tax rates over this period caused a shift in value from real assets, such as housing,
toward financial assets (See the analysis in Feldstein 1980, Summers 1981, and Poterba 1984). Finally,
between 1984 and 1991, aggregate financial assets rose by $4 trillion whereas saving incentive balances rose
by about $1 trillion (Engen, Gale, and Scholz 1996a). Thus, something other than saving incentives must
have been boosting financial assets. The existence of these non-401(k) factors makes the “similar savers”
test based only on the results for eligibles difficult to interpret, and surely biased toward overstating the
impact of 401(k)s on saving.9
Third, the test assumes that the additive impact of 401(k)s on wealth is the same in each earnings
class. However, most participants contribute similar proportions of their salary to 401(k)s, making it
plausible that the additive effect would vary across earnings groups over time.
(2) Tests Comparing Financial Assets Over Time for Eligible and Ineligible Families
One way to address the problems created by examining only eligible families over time is to use
ineligible families over time as a control group. In this test, the effects of 401(k)s are identified by the
assumption that nothing that changed over the sample period had a differential impact on the group of
eligibles relative to the group of ineligibles. Thus, if assets rose more for eligibles over time than for
ineligibles, the difference would be interpreted as the positive effect of 401(k)s on wealth accumulation.
To implement this test, Poterba, Venti, and Wise (1995) estimate regressions with the same form as

9

On the other hand, one might argue that the declining official personal saving rate over this period would
work in the opposite direction and serve to reduce financial assets. However, the official personal saving rate
badly mismeasures changes in wealth--which are the focus of this study--and in particular omits capital gains,
which were large during this period. See Gale and Sabelhaus (1999).

(2), but for samples of ineligible households:

(3)

Wj

' "I % Xj$I % E6K'2((Ik(Yjk) % *I84(IN84j % *I91(IN91j % uIj.

where variables are defined analogously to equation (2) and W represents non-saving incentive financial
assets. They find that *I84 and *I91 are approximately zero. Thus, the result of separately estimating (2) and
(3) is that financial assets rose for eligibles as a group over this period, but did not rise for ineligibles as a
group. Poterba, Venti, and Wise (1995) interpret this finding as evidence that 401(k)s have raised saving.
This is clearly a stronger test than any based only on samples of eligibles over time, but it is still
problematic. First, as with tests based only on eligible households, one concern is whether average tastes for
saving changed over time. But for this test, the relevant question is whether average tastes for saving
changed for eligible households relative to ineligible households. This issue is discussed in section V.
Second, a test comparing the effects of estimating (2) on eligibles and (3) on ineligibles measures the
impact of 401(k)s with a single coefficient for each year. But as shown above, eligibles as a group started the
sample period with higher earnings, financial assets, and wealth than ineligibles did. Thus, any change that is
not controlled for and that raised all financial assets by the same proportionate amount would have increased
financial assets by a larger arithmetic amount for eligibles than for ineligibles. This would appear, in (2) and
(3), as a larger effect over time for eligibles relative to ineligibles, but would not be due to 401(k)s. Thus, for
example, the stock market boom, or proportionate shifts in the allocation of wealth from real assets to
financial assets would lead to spurious increases in financial assets for eligibles relative to ineligibles.
Likewise, any change that aided high-earnings households relative to low-earners would have similar spurious
effects. For example, the well-documented widening of the income distribution helped high-earners relative
to low-earners. The stock market boom did as well, because high-earning households are more likely to hold
stocks and hold a larger share of their portfolio in stocks (Poterba and Samwick 1999) than low-earning

11

households.
A third concern is that this test, like the one for eligible households described above, assumes that the
effect of 401(k)s on wealth is the same across all earnings classes. This clearly need not be the case.
(3) Tests Comparing Wealth Over Time for Eligible and Ineligible Families
In earlier work (Engen and Gale 1997, tables 5-7 and 11-13), we estimate (2) and (3) on net financial
assets and on broader measures of wealth that include housing equity. Our results generally confirmed the
Poterba, Venti, and Wise (1995) finding; net financial assets rose more for eligibles as a group than for
ineligibles. These results, of course, are subject to the same problems as those noted above. We also found,
however, that broader wealth measures that included housing equity did not rise for eligibles relative to
ineligibles. We concluded that the impact of 401(k)s on household wealth--as opposed to financial assets-was minimal.
These results have been criticized on several grounds. First, there is concern about how average
tastes for saving among eligibles evolved over time relative to ineligibles (Bernheim 1997). Second, Poterba,
Venti, and Wise (1996a, 1996b) note that at the beginning of the sample period, eligibles as a group had
higher housing wealth than ineligibles did. During the sample period, especially 1987-91, they argue that
there were equal percentage declines in housing wealth among eligibles and ineligibles, due to housing market
factors that are completely unrelated to 401(k)s. However, because eligibles started out with higher housing
wealth, they had a larger arithmetic decline in their housing wealth. This shows up as a reduction in wealth
for eligibles relative to ineligibles, because Engen and Gale (1997) use wealth levels as the dependent
variable, but should not be interpreted as an offset to 401(k) wealth.10

10

Engen and Gale (1997, tables 4-6 and 8-10) also estimate a single equation model of the form:
Wj ' " % Xj$ % E6k'2((k ( Yjk) % *1(ELIGj % *2(IN91j % *3(ELIGj(IN91j % u j.

The impact of 401(k)s is given by *3. This approach, however, combines the coefficient estimates for
eligibles and ineligibles, which is not a valid restriction if tastes for saving differ across groups. Appendix
Tables 1 and 2 show that this restriction is rejected by the data. Recent analyses by Sabelhaus and Ayotte
(1998) and Pence (2000) employ the specification above and thus are subject to the same critique.
12

(4) Summary, reconciliation, and new directions
Remarkably, the criticisms of the Engen and Gale (1997) estimates, which use wealth including
housing equity as the dependent variable, almost exactly parallel the criticisms of the Poterba, Venti and Wise
(1995) estimates, which use financial assets as the dependent variable. In each case, the argument is that (a)
eligibles as a group began the sample period with higher earnings and wealth than ineligibles, and (b) outside
factors caused changes in wealth across earnings classes that ended up being confused with the impact of
401(k)s. The outside factors caused financial assets to grow in arithmetic terms for high-earners relative to
low-earners over this period, leading Engen, Gale and Scholz (1996a, 1996b) to argue that tests of (2) and (3)
using financial assets overstated the impact of 401(k) plans. In contrast, other outside factors caused
housing wealth to fall in arithmetic terms for high-earners relative to low-earners, leading Poterba, Venti and
Wise (1996a, 1996b) to argue that tests using (2) and (3) that used broad wealth measures that include
housing understated the impact of 401(k)s.
Two simple changes to (2) and (3) can resolve these problems. First, to separate the effects of
401(k) eligibility from changes in other factors that affect wealth and that have different effects at different
earnings levels, the effects of eligibility should be examined within each earnings class rather than for the
group as a whole. For example, Poterba, Venti, and Wise (1996b, page 54) indicate that, despite large
differences in housing equity between the typical eligible and the typical ineligible household, “within income
intervals, the differences are typically small.” Second, to remove the impact of factors that cause
equiproportionate changes in wealth for different groups over time, analysis should examine the effects of
401(k)s on log wealth rather wealth levels. These are two of the significant changes to our previous analysis
that we introduce below.

III. Modeling 401(k)s and Wealth Accumulation
We develop our econometric model in several steps. First, we eliminate the 1984 data from

13

consideration since the SIPP does not provide information on 401(k) balances in that year. Thus, we drop the
IN84 terms in equations (2) and (3). Second, we expand (2) and (3), which estimate wealth for eligibles and
ineligibles separately, to allow the coefficient on IN91 to vary by earnings class:

(4)

Wj

' "E % Xj$E % E6k'2((Ek(Yjk) % E6k'1(*Ek(IN91j(Yjk) % uEj, and

(5)

Wj

' "I % Xj$I % E6k'2((Ik(Yjk) % E6k'1(*Ik(IN91j(Yjk) % uIj.

Third, we multiply (4) by the eligibility indicator and (5) by 1- the eligibility indicator and combine the
equations to yield our central specification:

Wj

(6)

' "I % ("E&"I)(ELIGj % Xj$I % Xj($E&$I)(ELIGj
% E6k'2((Ik(Yjk) % E6k'2((Ek&(Ik)Yjk(ELIGj
% E6k'1(*Ik(IN91j(Yjk) % E6k'1(*Ek&*Ik)(IN91j(Yjk(ELIGj % uj.

In (6), W measures wealth, X is a vector of demographic variables, Yk indexes earnings categories, IN91
indicates if a household is in the 1991 sample, and ELIG shows if the household is eligible for a 401(k).
Estimating (6) will yield the same coefficients as estimating (4) for eligibles and (5) for ineligibles
and then differencing the results.11 Also, (6) generalizes specifications used in earlier work. The successive
cross-section analyses outlined above assume that *Ek = *E and *Ik = *I for all earnings groups k. Some other
features of this specification are worth discussing in more detail.
A. Control group

11

In practice, the standard errors would be slightly different, because (5) imposes the assumption that

FE ' FI , where FE and FI represent the standard deviations of the error terms in equations (4) and (5)
respectively.
14

The key coefficients in (6) are *Ek - *Ik, which indicate how much wealth increased in each earnings
class from 1987 to 1991 for eligible households relative to ineligible households. Thus, the control group for
eligibles is ineligibles in the same earnings class. There are several advantages to using this control group.
Two reasons were noted above. Eligibles and ineligibles have similar--though clearly not identical-economic and demographic characteristics after controlling for earnings, and changes that are uncontrolled for
and that have differential effects across earnings classes will not bias the results in this specification. There
are several additional reasons, though, to isolate effects of 401(k)s by earnings class. First, the rate and level
of saving appear to vary across earnings groups (Dynan, Skinner, and Zeldes 2000, and Hubbard, Skinner,
and Zeldes 1995). In addition, the constraints that savers face--for example, government means-testing rules
or tax rates and other rules--typically vary by earnings classes. Allowing for different effects of 401(k)s by
earnings group will control for these effects, as long as they do not differ between eligibles and ineligibles
within an earnings category. Second, the ability to substitute other assets into a 401(k) or to finance
contributions with debt may vary across earnings classes, since high-earning households tend to have higher
wealth. Third, to the extent that participants contribute similar percentages of their salary to 401(k)s, the
effects of 401(k)s on wealth will vary with earnings.
B. Narrow versus Broad Measures of the Dependent Variable
We consider the impact of 401(k)s on both net financial assets and wealth (net financial assets plus
housing equity). In the aftermath of TRA 1986, which eliminated interest deductions on non-mortgage
consumer debt, high-income households switched their portfolios toward increased mortgage debt and
reduced non-mortgage debt (Maki 1999). A study that examined only net financial assets would mistake this
shift in the composition of debt for an increase in net financial assets. In addition, for the typical household,
financial assets are a small fraction of net worth.12 Thus, an investigation of the effect of 401(k)s only on net

12

In our sample, mean household financial assets were 25 percent of mean net worth in 1984 and rose to
33 percent in 1991. Median holdings of financial assets were 7 percent of median net worth in 1984 and rose
to 13 percent in 1991. Aggregate data follow similar trends, with financial assets an even higher proportion
15

financial assets would miss many potential sources of substitution.
Substitution between housing wealth and 401(k) plans should not be surprising. Both types of taxfavored assets are relatively illiquid and typically held for a long period. In addition, there are strong
financial incentives for households to substitute and thus diversify their tax-preferred portfolio. Employer
matching of 401(k) contributions implies that financing a 401(k) with tax-deductible mortgage borrowing can
be quite lucrative.13 Even if households are not consciously gaming the tax system, there could still be
substitution between 401(k)s and home equity that is unintentional. Consider different cohorts of new
homeowners who are observationally equivalent except that the new homeowners in the later year have had
longer exposure to 401(k)s and so have placed more funds in 401(k)s than did those in the younger cohort.
Now suppose that households in the later cohort have smaller balances of liquid cash (because they have
moved more of their liquid cash into 401(k)s) than those in the earlier cohort). Because they have less cash
available, households in the later cohort might purchase the same size home as the earlier cohort, but with a
larger mortgage. A comparison of households in these two cohorts would reveal that households in the later
cohort had less housing equity, more 401(k) wealth, but the same overall wealth compared to households in
the younger cohort. As an analytical statement, households in the later cohort were clearly substituting
401(k)s for home equity relative to earlier cohorts, even if this substitution were completely unintentional and
even if the household itself were unaware of the comparison. Similar types of "inadvertent" substitution
could be quite widespread.14

of net worth because financial assets are heavily concentrated among the very wealthiest households, which
are under represented in our data set.
13

See Engen, Gale and Scholz (1996b). Simple calculations show that with typical employer matching
contributions, workers should do everything possible to maximize 401(k) contributions at least up to the
match limit. Kusko, Poterba, and Wilcox (1994) report that about 75 percent of 401(k) participants in their
sample at one firm contributed at or above the match limit.
14

As Stiglitz (1988, p. 595) notes: "The individual may, of course, not consciously perceive himself as
borrowing for these purposes; he may say to himself in April that it would be a good idea to put money into
an IRA; and then in June, he may decide that he would like to buy a new car; given his available cash, he
16

It is also worth noting that between about 14 percent of eligible homeowners had home equity loans
in 1991; about 19 percent bought new homes between 1987 and 1991; and a reasonable estimate is that 12
percent extracted equity from their home via a refinancing between 1987 and 1991 (Bernheim 1997). Thus a
significant portion of eligible families had direct access to ways to change in home equity.
C. Functional Form of the Dependent Variable
We estimate models with four different functional forms of the dependent variable: the level of
wealth; the ratio of wealth to earnings; and the natural log of these two values. We use wealth levels to
compare to previous research. Using wealth-earnings ratios, however, is a natural way to control for the
effects of 401(k)s if participants at different earnings levels tend to contribute similar percentage of their
salary to 401(k)s. In addition, using the wealth-earnings ratio helps control for any variation in earnings over
time within earnings categories. Finally, in detailed dynamic saving models (see, for example, Hubbard,
Skinner, and Zeldes 1995, Samwick 1995, Laibson, Repetto, and Tobacman, 1998, or Engen, Gale, and
Uccello 1999) implications often can be drawn as readily with regard to wealth-earnings ratios as with regard
to wealth levels.
The justification for estimating log wealth and log wealth/earnings ratios stems from the combination
of two issues. First, eligibles and ineligibles start the sample period with different assets, even within
earnings groups. This suggests that there may be still differences in tastes for saving between the two groups,
even after controlling for earnings. Second, if the groups begin the sample with different wealth levels,
market forces that cause assets to rise or fall by a constant percentage rather than by a constant amount will
create spurious effects for a specification that controls for wealth levels or wealth/earnings ratios.15 A

finds that he needs to borrow more than he otherwise would have."
15

Suppose 401(k)s have no effect on saving, and consider an eligible household (E) in year 1 with wealth
of 100, and an ineligible household (I) with lower tastes for saving and hence wealth of 50. (Assume the two
households have equal earnings.) If market forces raise all asset values by 20 percent in one period, then E
will have wealth of 120 and I will have 60. A difference-in-difference estimate using wealth levels would
show that E’s wealth rose by 10 more than I’s. By construction, however, this effect is not due to 401(k)s.
17

natural way to control for percentage changes is by using log wealth.16
D. Explanatory Variables
Dynamic models with earnings uncertainty (see Hubbard, Skinner, and Zeldes 1995, Samwick 1995,
Laibson, Repetto, and Tobacman 1998, and Engen, Gale, and Uccello 1999) do not generate closed-form
solutions for wealth. However, the results show clearly that wealth or wealth/earnings ratios should evolve as
a function of age (for life-cycle reasons), education (as a proxy for the slope of the age-earnings profile and/or
tastes for saving), earnings (because social security, welfare programs, and income taxes are progressive),
and marital status (as a proxy for family size). All of these are controlled for in all previous studies of
401(k)s. In addition, theory and evidence suggests that pension coverage, family size, the presence of two
earners and taste-shifters relating to race and sex of the household head should affect saving as well. We thus
include all of these as right-hand side regressors.
All of the explanatory variables other than family size are expressed are indicator variables. For age,
the categories are 35-44, 45-54, and 55-64, with 25-34 being the omitted category. For education, the
categories are 12 years, 13-15 years, 16 years, and more than 16 years, with less than 12 years as the omitted
category. For earnings, we use the categories listed in tables 1-3, but we exclude all households with earnings
less than $10,000 from the regressions because of data irregularities. This should have minimal impact on
the results since these households account for only 1 percent of 401(k) balances. The regressions omit the
$10,000-$20,000 earnings category as an explanatory variable.

IV. Results
A. Descriptive data on asset changes by eligibility status and earnings group

Likewise, if the market fell by 20 percent, E’s wealth fall by 10 relative to I, but this would not be evidence
that 401(k)s reduced saving.
16

Pence (2000) explicitly recognizes these issues and proposes the use of inverse hyperbolic sine
transformation of wealth, rather than the log, to resolve the problem.
18

Table 5 shows how median wealth measures evolved from 1987 to 1991 for eligible households
relative to ineligible households by earnings class. For eligibles as a whole, median 401(k) balances rose by
$1,214. In earnings groups above $30,000, median 401(k) balances rose by between $1,700 and $6,000.
Thus, there was a substantial increase in median 401(k) balances during this period, especially in higher
earnings groups. Median balances in saving incentive accounts rose by similar amounts.
Net financial assets rose for eligibles relative to ineligibles in middle- and upper-income groups, but
not for the highest earnings group. Other than saving incentive balances, financial assets fell for eligibles
relative to ineligibles in most groups. House value rose for eligibles relative to ineligibles within earnings
groups, but mortgage debt rose even more--especially in high-earnings groups--so that housing equity fell for
eligibles relative to ineligibles in three of the six groups and on an overall basis. Median wealth rose for
eligibles relative to ineligibles in most earnings groups, but fell for eligibles as a whole compared to
ineligibles.
B. Replication and Extension of Earlier Work
Table 6 replicates and extends earlier estimates by Poterba, Venti and Wise (PVW, 1995). The
explanatory variables include only variables used in their study: indicators for age, education, earnings, and
marital status, and whether the household is in the 1991 sample. Poterba, Venti, and Wise (1995) report
analytical standard errors. Monte Carlo tests suggest that, in the presence of heteroskedasticity, bootstrapped
standard errors provide more reliable estimates than analytical standard errors (Rogers 1992). We present
results using both approaches. Items in parentheses in the tables represent t-statistics using analytical
standard errors. Items in square brackets represent t-statistics using bootstrapped standard errors (with 200
replications).17
We begin by estimating (2) for eligibles. When the dependent variable is net financial assets, we
estimate that *E91 = $1,190 (with t=2.91), the first entry in table 6. Median 401(k) balances among eligibles

17

Pence (2000) provides further discussion of alternative methods of generating standard errors.
19

increased by $1,214 over this period (table 5), so the estimate in table 6 suggests that all 401(k) contributions
were new saving, which is consistent with the results and interpretation given in PVW (1995). If the
dependent variable is financial assets excluding saving incentives, we obtain *E91 = -$600 (t=3.41),
suggesting a drop in other financial assets. For ineligible households, we estimate (3) and find that *I91 is
approximately zero. These results are similar to PVW (1995, Table 5).
The next step is to allow the effects of 401(k)s to vary by earnings class over time. The results of
estimating (4) for eligibles with the dependent variable equal to net financial assets is given in the first row of
table 6 in the 2nd-7th columns. The * coefficients are positive in each income class. Using the analytical
standard errors, the results are significant only in the top two earnings groups. More importantly, an F-test
easily rejects the view that the coefficients are all equal across earnings classes. The test statistic is 6.23,
whereas the 1 percent critical value for F(5, 6407) is 3.02. The huge increase in financial assets in the top
earning group, $7,756, is particularly notable and we return to this estimate below. The second row of table
6, columns 2-7, shows the same regression, but with wealth equal to non-saving incentive financial assets.
The coefficients are uniformly negative, and the top three earnings groups have large and significant
coefficients, using the analytical standard errors.
The next two rows of table 6, columns 2-7, show the same regressions for ineligible households. In
the regression for financial assets, note the huge coefficient for the top income group ($7,223). This is
essentially the same increase as for high-earning eligibles noted above and shows the importance of using a
control group, rather than simply relying on tests for eligible households over time. Generally, there is no
increase in financial assets for ineligible households by earnings group, except for the top group. An F-test
generates a test statistic of 136 (1 percent critical value = 3.02), thus easily rejecting the view that the
coefficients are equal across income class.
To compare the results for the eligible and ineligible households by earnings categories, we
subtract the coefficients in row 3 and 4 from those in 1 and 2 and calculate the standard errors. These values

20

are reported in the last two rows of the table and show positive but statistically insignificant increases for
financial assets in all earnings groups except for households with earnings between $50,000 and $75,000,
where the effect is positive and significant. The table shows economically and statistically significant
declines in non-saving incentive financial assets in the top three earnings groups. All of the above discussion
focuses on analytical standard errors, for comparison purposes with earlier work. Using the bootstrapped
standard errors reduces the significance of almost all of the coefficients.
Thus, the results in table 6 generate several important findings. First, we are able to replicate the
results in earlier literature using equation (2) and (3) that show that using only a single parameter to capture
year effects will generate results that are consistent with the view that 401(k)s raise saving. Second, we show
that the specification with a single parameter capturing year effects is statistically rejected in favor of a more
general specification that allows the effects of 401(k)s to vary across earnings class and time. Third, we
show that using the more general specification implies smaller impacts of 401(k)s on financial assets.
Fourth, we show that using the bootstrapped standard errors reduces the significance of 401(k) effects
further.
C. Full Specification with Wealth Level as the Dependent Variable
Table 7 provides estimates of (6) using wealth levels as the dependent variable. The estimates that
employ analytical standard errors show that 401(k) eligibility has a positive and significant impact on
financial assets in earnings groups between $30,000 and $75,000, and leads to economically significant
reductions in non-saving incentives financial assets in earnings groups above $40,000. Examining wealth
(defined as net financial assets plus housing equity) suggests only one positive significant impact (in the
$30,000-$40,000 earnings class). Examining non-saving incentive wealth suggests offsets in the top three
earnings categories.
These results tell an interesting story, and one that is not completely consistent with either the earlier
Poterba, Venti, and Wise (1995) or the Engen and Gale (1997) conclusions. In the top earnings group, there

21

appears to be no impact of 401(k)s on financial assets or wealth, and a significant reduction in other assets
due to 401(k)s. In the next two groups--with earnings between $40,000 and $75,000--401(k) eligibility is
associated with higher financial assets, but not with higher wealth, and there is significant offset in both nonsaving incentive financial assets (row 2) and non-saving incentive wealth (row 4). The three top earnings
groups account for about 70-80 percent of 401(k) balances in the two sample years (see table 2), and that in
these groups there does not appear to be any positive effect of 401(k)s on wealth.
For households with earnings between $30,000 and $40,000, the estimated impact of 401(k)s on
saving is as large as the increase in 401(k) balances for eligibles in this group (table 5), suggesting that all of
the 401(k) balances in this group are net new private saving. This group accounts for about 11-16 percent of
401(k) balances in each year. For households with earnings between $10,000 and $30,000, the impact of
401(k) eligibility is hard to discern: wealth measures including 401(k)s generate positive but imprecisely
estimated coefficients; wealth measures excluding 401(k)s generally generate negative but imprecisely
estimated coefficients. Part of the problem undoubtedly is the relatively small change in 401(k) balances
among eligibles in these groups (see table 5). These two groups contain 9-13 percent of 401(k) balances in
each sample year.
Thus, the results in table 7 suggest that between 70 and 80 percent of 401(k) balances accrue in
earnings groups where eligibility has no noticeable impact on wealth accumulation. Between 11 and 16
percent accrue in the earnings group where upwards of 100 percent of 401(k) balances appear to represent net
additions to private saving. And the remaining 9-13 percent has an uncertain effect. Note, however, that
even if all of the balances of households with earnings below $40,000 were net saving, this would only
account for between 25 and 29 percent of 401(k) balances.
In addition, note that all of these effects are based on the analytical standard errors. Using bootstraps
generally reduces all of the t-statistics. (Only one of the coefficients in table 7 is even significant at the 10
percent level.) Appendix tables 1 and 2 report the full set of coefficient estimates for the specifications in

22

table 7 using net financial assets and wealth as the dependent variables. The results indicate the economic
and statistical significance of a wide range of explanatory variables, when entered alone and when interacted
with eligibility.
Appendix table 3 provides similar estimates and generally similar results to table 7, but uses a robust
regression technique.18 We have also estimated the equations using ordinary least squares (OLS). These
estimates are perhaps suspect because they may be unduly influenced by outliers and saving is known to be
quite heterogeneous across households. Nevertheless, the OLS estimates find no significant effects, except in
the top earnings group where they show complete offset of 401(k) balances with reductions in other wealth.
D. Estimates by Saver Group with Wealth Level as the Dependent Variable
Table 8 provides median regression estimates similar to table 7 but with the sample broken down
into separate groups based on saving status. The goal of this exercise is to help control for tastes for saving
by isolating groups with similar propensities or similar opportunities to incur debt or shift assets. Thus, we
stratify by IRA status and homeowner status.
Among households with IRAs, 401(k) eligibility has a positive but statistically insignificant effect on
net financial assets. The impact on wealth is negative and insignificant in four of the six earnings categories,
and positive and insignificant in two. An F-test does not reject the view that all of the wealth coefficients are
zero. The test statistic is 0.61, whereas the 5 percent critical value for F (6, 5143) is 2.80.
For households without IRAs or Keoghs, the estimated effects on wealth are positive and significant
for households with earnings between $30,000 and $75,000, and are as large as the change in 401(k)
balances over time. Thus, plausibly all of these 401(k) balances represent net additions to private saving.

18

The robust regression method is described in Stata (1993, volume 2, pp. 126-131). The first step is an
ordinary least squares regression; outliers (i.e., any observation with Cook’s D>1) are then excluded. The
procedure then works iteratively: an ordinary least squares regression is run, weights are calculated based on
the absolute residuals, and then those weights are used in estimating the next regression. This process
continues until convergence is obtained in the successive estimates. The first set of weights used are Huber
weights. Based on those results, biweights are then used until convergence is obtained. Both weights are
used in order to offset potential problems with using either one or the other.
23

These groups held between 26 and 33 percent of 401(k) balances in 1987 and 1991. However, using
bootstrapped standard errors, none of these effects are significant.
For homeowners, there is a strong positive significant impact of 401(k)s on financial assets in all
earnings groups except the highest and the lowest, but there is no significant impact on wealth, and four of
the six coefficients for wealth are actually negative. This is important because homeowners hold about 88
percent of 401(k) balances in each year of the sample. The effect for the top earnings group is clearly not
positive. An F-test does not reject the hypothesis that all wealth coefficients in earnings groups below
$75,000 are zero (the test statistic is 0.27, whereas the 1 percent critical value for F(5, 12434) is 3.02).
For renters, the effect of eligibility on net financial assets is positive and significant, and as large as
the increase in 401(k) balances, in four earnings categories. These groups account for about 8 percent of
401(k) balances. In the other earnings categories, eligibility does not have a positive and significant effect.
In summary, separate estimates by saver status suggest that between 8 percent and 33 percent of
401(k) balances represent new private saving, using the analytical standard errors. This is consistent with the
results in table 7, which provided estimates from 11-16 percent to 25-29 percent. The net saving effect is
most likely to occur for households that have lower wealth, lower earnings or are renters.
E. Other Functional Forms for Wealth
Appendix Table 4 provides estimates with wealth measures divided by earnings as the dependent
variable. Results are similar to those in tables 7 and 8.
Specifications of the effect of eligibility on log wealth must confront the fact that a significant
minority of households have zero or negative wealth. To address this issue, we proceed in several steps.
First, we restrict the sample to age-education-earnings groups where more than 50 percent of households have
positive net financial assets and positive net wealth. This turns out to include all age-education-earnings
groups with earnings above $30,000. These households account for at least 85 percent of all 401(k) balances
(table 2) in each year. Second, rather than exclude households in these cells that have zero or negative net

24

financial assets or wealth, we instead reassign their wealth to equal 1. By doing so, we retain valuable
information about these households, but we do not alter the median wealth figures in each cell. If all of
reassigned observations lie below the regression line, the LAD coefficient estimates for the sample with the
reassigned values will be exactly the same as if the zero and negative wealth values could be used
(Bloomfield and Steiger 1983).19 In theory, the standard deviations of the coefficient estimates will be the
same as well. However, in the presence of non-continuous variables, such as the indicator variables in our
regression, the standard deviations of the coefficients can vary in an apparently unbiased way. Third, to test
the empirical effects of this transformation, we re-estimated the specifications in table 7 using wealth levels,
but reassigning all negative and zero values of the dependent variables to 1. This procedure generated the
numerically identical set of estimated coefficients with standard deviations of the estimates that were about
50 percent larger.
Appendix table 5 presents estimates of the model using a log transformation of the wealth level.
Table 9 estimates the model with the dependent variable being a log transformation of the wealth to earnings
ratio.20 The results in the latter two tables are similar and we will focus on the estimates in table 9 using log
(wealth/earnings).
For the whole sample with earnings above $30,000, focusing on the analytical standard errors, table
9 shows a sizable effect of eligibility on financial assets for households with earnings between $30,000 and
$40,000, but no significant effects for the higher income groups. The results also suggest a significant,
albeit much smaller, increase for wealth for those earning between $30,000 and $40,000. Effects on wealth
are positive but not significant for those with earnings between $40,000 and $75,000, and negative and
insignificant for the highest earning group. The hypothesis that the impact on wealth in the top three earnings

19

Johnson, Kitamura and Neal (2000) recently make use of this result, for example, to impute unobserved
wages for unemployed individuals in median wage regressions.
20

Before taking the log, we multiply the ratio of wealth to income by 50,000 to set the dependent variable
at the same order of magnitude as in the log (wealth) specification.
25

groups is zero cannot be rejected at conventional levels.
Analysis on sub-samples of households that have enough wealth to be considered for the log
specification greatly reduces the impact of 401(k) eligibility. Recall that for the whole group earning between
$30,000 and $40,000, eligibility was estimated to raise wealth by 24 percent. However, among IRA holders
in that group, the effect falls to 0.6 percent and for homeowners the effect falls to 3.7 percent. In neither of
the latter two cases is the effect significant. For the higher-income groups with IRAs or with a home, the
effects are generally small and not different from zero. Thus, results using log wealth/earnings as the
dependent variable suggest an even smaller impact of 401(k) eligibility on wealth than do the wealth level
regressions.

V. Dilution
A crucial issue for interpreting these results and earlier results in the literature is whether and how
average tastes for saving shifted over time for different groups. Note that this is an effort to estimate an
unobserved variable that changes over time, and thus may prove difficult. In addition, the relevant
comparison groups depend on the underlying specification. For regressions using samples of eligible families
over time, such as the second test in table 4, the key issue is whether average tastes for saving among
eligibles fell. For tests comparing samples of eligible and ineligible families, such as the third and fourth
tests in table 4, the key issue is whether average tastes for saving fell over time for eligibles relative to
ineligibles. For the tests conducted in this paper, the key issue is whether average tastes for saving fell over
time for eligibles relative to ineligibles within earnings groups.
A. Dilution Among Eligible Households Over Time
Because of the rapid expansion of 401(k) eligibility in the 1980s, Bernheim (1997) argues that the
sample of eligible households likely had declines in average taste for saving over time. He argues that the
most committed savers were likely to be the first to be eligible for such plans, and over time an increasing

26

number of less committed savers became eligible, reducing average tastes for saving among eligibles. This
presents a prima facie case in favor of dilution among eligibles, but other factors need to be considered too.
For example, Ippolito (1993) posits that one reason 401(k) plans have become so popular is that they
help firms attract good workers. Ippolito presents theory and evidence that workers with low discount rates
(high tastes for saving) are likely to be more productive, but may be difficult to identify. A 401(k) plan helps
solve this problem in several ways. First, by providing employer matching, the firm is able to pay workers
who are willing to save more than those who are not. This will prove relatively more attractive to workers
with high tastes for saving and thus will help attract and retain such workers. Second, workers with high
discount rates (or low tastes for saving) will be able to access the cash in their account if they quit the firm.
This will encourage such workers to leave. The Ippolito model suggests that over time, holding constant the
pool of firms that offer 401(k)s, the eligible sample should become less diluted--that is, that average tastes
for saving should rise among eligibles. Of course, as Bernheim emphasizes, the pool of firms that offered
401(k)s expanded rapidly, which could cause dilution among eligibles over time. The net effect of these two
factors is difficult to discern.
Some evidence can be obtained from the fact that 401(k) participation rates, conditional on eligibility
and employer matching, rose over time. The opposite would be expected if the sample of eligibles were
becoming diluted. Table 1 shows that participation rates, conditional on eligibility, in the SIPP have
increased over time. But recall that participation is defined in the SIPP as having a positive balance, not
actively making a contribution. So, even with dilution, this rate could rise over time.
More compelling evidence comes from the Current Population Survey (CPS) for 1988 to 1993.
The CPS data are important because participation can be defined as making a contribution in the current
period. Using this definition, one would not expect conditional participation rates to rise, if the sample of
eligibles were becoming more diluted. But table 10 shows that among eligible workers, participation rates
rose from 1988 to 1993 in all earnings groups, and by substantial amounts.

27

Bernheim (1999) notes that participation may have increased because of the tightening of nondiscrimination rules in the late 1980s, and that an effective way for employers to meet the tighter rules was to
provide matching contributions. However, table 10 also shows that participation rates rose among employees
who did not receive a matching contribution. In addition, if matching were being used to meet nondiscrimination rules, one would expect participation to rise more rapidly among low-earners than among
high-earners. Table 10, however, shows that the increase in participation rates was higher for workers
earning $30,000-$75,000 than for workers earning less than $30,000. This difference is even larger among
firms that matched. Adding controls for pension status, and thus changes in coverage over time, does not
affect these findings. Alternatively, eligibles could be participating at a higher rate, but participants could be
contributing less on average. In fact, however, table 11 shows that in almost all earnings and matching
categories, participants contributed more in 1993 than in 1988.21
B. Dilution of Eligible Households Relative to Ineligible Households
If average tastes for saving fell among eligibles, but fell by the same amount among ineligibles, then
there would be no net bias from dilution issues. This could occur if the workers who became newly eligible
for 401(k)s over time had higher than average tastes for saving among ineligibles, or if those who were
eligible but became ineligible had lower than average tastes for saving among eligible workers.
Evidence on dilution of eligibles relative to ineligibles as a group can be gleaned from different
sources. First, job-leavers tend to cash out their 401(k) balances and thus leave the pool of eligible workers
(Burman, Coe and Gale 1999). Job-stayers tend to be savers. For example, Even and MacPherson (1999)
find that workers who are more likely to participate in 401(k)s conditional on eligibility--that is, those with

21

There are, of course, other possibilities for why participation rose even though the sample became more
diluted, but none seems convincing. For example, employers could have responded in other ways than
matching, such as financial education. But Bernheim and Garrett (1995) note that the big push in financial
education did not even begin until the early 1990s and that it covered only a fraction of employers and
employees by the early 1990s. In addition, 401(k) participation could have risen because the stock market
became more popular during this period, but if that were the case, one would have expected IRA participation
to rise, too, but it did not.
28

higher tastes for saving--are also more likely to be “stayers” on the job--that is, to have long job tenure.
These results suggest that over time, those with higher tastes for saving are attracted to 401(k)s, while those
with lower tastes tend to drop out of the pool of eligible workers.
Second, Pence (2000) provides data on self-reported motives for saving among eligible and ineligible
households in the Survey of Consumer Finances from 1989 to 1995. These results show a decline in
propensities to save for eligibles relative to ineligibles for some saving categories and an increase in other
saving categories. On balance, motives for saving do not appear to have changed very much for eligibles as a
group compared to ineligibles over the sample period. This is consistent with no dilution having occurred for
eligibles as a group relative to ineligibles as a group.
C. Dilution of Eligibles Relative to Ineligibles within Earnings Groups
The most important dilution issue for our purposes is whether average tastes for saving declined
among eligibles relative to ineligibles within the same earnings classes. There is little evidence on which to
base such a judgment. Table 3 does show that, within earnings classes, the relative values of age and
education are very similar at a point in time for eligibles and ineligibles and do not change relative values
over time. To the extent that tastes for saving are correlated with these factors, there is little evidence of any
shift in tastes for saving between eligibles and ineligibles, controlling for earnings.
A more difficult hypothesis to judge is, loosely, that eligible workers have “good jobs,” ineligible
workers have “bad jobs” and that over the time period in question good jobs got better and bad jobs got
worse. This possibility merits several comments, though. First, the regressions already control for earnings,
age, education, and non-401(k) pension coverage. Second, regressions that control additionally for health
insurance coverage and for industry and occupation generate similar results. Thus, in order to affect our
results, any change in prospects for good and bad jobs would have to go beyond the change in prospects
implied by all of these observable criteria. Third, a dominant feature of “bad jobs” is the lack of wage
growth, but average age-earnings profiles look very similar for eligibles and ineligibles in the 1991 cross-

29

section. These estimates do not follow individuals over time, but there is nevertheless no evidence that older
ineligible workers are doing worse relative to younger ineligible workers than older eligible workers are doing
compared to younger eligible workers. Finally, the impact of having a good job get better or a bad job get
worse can change saving in different ways, depending on whether the change was anticipated, expected to be
permanent and other factors. Thus, even if the job dichotomy view is correct, it is difficult to formulate
unambiguous implications for saving.
D. Evidence from IRA participation
Bernheim (1999) argues that changes in the propensity to hold IRAs between 1987 and 1991 are a
good indicator of the extent of dilution because IRA ownership is a stable indicator of tastes for saving during
that period. Thus, to test for dilution, we estimate three separate probits. The first examines all eligible
households in 1987 and 1991, with a right hand side specification the same as in (2). This shows a
statistically significant decline in IRA participation among eligibles between 1987 and 1991 of about 5
percentage points, and under Bernheim’s argument, is evidence of dilution of the eligible sample.
The second probit examines all households in 1987 and 1991 and uses a right hand side specification
like (6), but allows for only one year-effect for eligibles and ineligibles (that is, it sets *Ek=*E for all k and

*Ik=*I for all k). The result implies that eligibles as a group were only 1.8 percentage points less likely to
hold an IRA in 1991 than 1987, compared to the change for ineligibles. Moreover, the effect is not
significant (t=1.3). This suggests that the case for dilution of eligibles relative to ineligibles is significantly
weaker than the case for dilution of the overall sample of eligibles over time.
The third probit examines all households in 1987 and 1991 and uses a right hand side specification
like (6), allowing the change in probability of IRA ownership to vary across time, earnings class, and
eligibility status. None of the six estimated coefficients are significantly different from zero, and two are
actually positive. This suggests that the case that there is dilution within earnings classes is even weaker than
the case that there is dilution of eligibles relative to ineligibles.

30

VI. Extensions
A. Sensitivity Analysis
The models estimated above extend the existing literature in many ways, but can in turn be extended
further. In this section, we discuss a variety of alternative specifications. All were carried out relative to the
basic specification in table 7. The first was to measure the effect of 401(k) eligibility on wealth measures less
401(k) wealth rather than on wealth less saving incentive balances. This hardly changed the results at all.
The second was to approximate employer matching contributions, which really should be considered as part
of wages, by raising the earnings of all participants by 5 percent. This also had virtually no effect on the
outcomes, in part because wages were raised for participants in both 1987 and 1991, so the difference over
time tended to wash out. Estimates using the 25th and 75th percentiles rather than the medians were
consistent with the results in the paper, but had low levels of significance.
Somewhat surprisingly, four additional and rather disparate alternative specifications all had a
common effect. The four specifications were as follows. (a) Limit the top earnings group to those who earned
less than $110,000, in case outliers were driving the results for this group; (b) Restrict the sample to
households that were aged 25-59 rather than 25-64 in each sample year, to reduce any problems with early
retirement and because this age group faces early withdrawal penalties; (c) Restrict the sample to households
that were aged 25-59 in 1987 and 29-64 in 1991, in order to follow the same age cohorts over time. This
regression controlled for age-in-1987 rather than current age. (d) Add the self-employed into the sample, to
account for possible differences in shifting employment patterns between eligibles and ineligibles over time.
The common effect was to make the coefficient on the highest earnings group in the financial assets equation
positive, large and significant (about the same size as the coefficient for the $50,000-$75,000 indicator in the
first row of table 7). None of the coefficients in the other equations changed significantly, however, so the
overall conclusions remain the same.
We also considered expanding the sample to include SIPP data from either 1984 or 1993. However,

31

the 1984 data lack information on 401(k) balances. This would permit estimates of non-401(k) wealth
measures, as in Poterba, Venti and Wise (1995) and Engen and Gale (1997), but such estimates cannot be
conclusive. The absence of a significant negative coefficient on the eligibility term would not prove that
401(k)s do not raise saving, and the presence of a significant negative coefficient would not demonstrate
much in the way of substitution. Tables 6 and 7 above demonstrate these facts for the 1987-91 period. In the
1993 SIPP, the 401(k) participation rate, conditional on eligibility, is lower than in 1991. However, other
data sources including the Surveys of Consumer Finances, the Form 5500s and the Current Population
Surveys suggest the conditional participation rate should have increased.
B. Biases
At least two items may bias our results toward overstating the effects of 401(k) plans on private
saving. First, there is some evidence that firms in the 1980s used 401(k) plans as pension replacements on
the margin (see Gale, Papke, and VanDerhei 2000). That is, firms stopped improving or “froze” their defined
benefit pension plans and poured marginal pension resources into 401(k) plans instead. To the extent that
this occurred, 401(k) eligible households would have incurred a reduction in wealth, but one that is not
observable in the SIPP, because the SIPP does not have information on the value of accumulated (non401(k)) pension rights among working households.22
Second, table 2 shows that about 70 percent of 401(k) balances in the SIPP are held by families with
earnings above $40,000 and our results suggest that these balances do not represent new private saving.
However, recall that wealthy households are under represented in the SIPP. We extracted a sample from the
1995 Survey of Consumer Finances, consisting of employed households, with no one self-employed, and
where the head was between the ages of 25 and 64. In that sample, 80 percent of 401(k) balances were held
by households with earnings above $50,000 (in 1991 dollars) and 89 percent were held by households with

22

It is also possible that firms dropped their defined benefit plans altogether and replaced them with
401(k)s. See Papke (1999). In the SIPP data, however, non-401(k) pension coverage rates did not change
significantly for eligibles relative to ineligibles over the sample period.
32

earnings above $40,000. If the SIPP understates the proportion of 401(k) balances held by higher-earning
households, our results may overstate the impact of 401(k)s on private saving.

VII. Conclusion
The impact of 401(k) plans on household wealth is a crucial issue for both academic analysis of the
determinants of saving and public policy discussions concerning retirement income. This paper addresses
conceptual and econometric problems that have arisen in previous work on 401(k)s and wealth and provides
new estimates. We make two principal adjustments in our model relative to the previous literature. The first
is to allow the effects of 401(k)s to vary by earnings class over time. The second is to estimate using a
variety of functional forms for the dependent variable that are more consistent with theory, are robust to
differences in initial asset position, and are robust to economy-wide effects that raise or lower all asset values
proportionately, or have different effects across earnings classes.
Several different tests suggest that the impact of 401(k) eligibility over time varies significantly by
earnings class; that during the sample period at least two-thirds of 401(k) balances accrue to households in
groups where 401(k) eligibility is not associated with higher wealth for eligibles relative to ineligibles; and
that it is the households that have low earnings or low wealth for whom 401(k)s may tend to be net saving.
The results for low earners, however, are generally much less significant when using the bootstrap standard
errors. Our estimates are robust, however, across different functional forms for the dependent variable. In
addition, the same general results emerge when estimating on the sample as a whole as when estimating on
various sub-groups and aggregating to obtain the overall estimate.
If we rely on our estimated analytical standard errors, then our estimates on the overall proportion of
401(k)s that represent net private saving are substantially below those of Poterba, Venti and Wise (1995),
who find no reduction in other private wealth due to 401(k)s. If we rely on bootstrap standard errors, then
our results are not much larger than our earlier estimates in Engen and Gale (1997). Note that all of these

33

results overstate the effects of 401(k) eligibility on national saving, because they do not account for the
attendant loss of revenue.
Our findings are also similar to some of the results in Benjamin (2000). Benjamin uses propensity
score methods to control for tastes for saving and finds that, among homeowners and households with IRAs,
there is no effect of 401(k)s on national saving, but positive effects of 401(k) eligibility among renters and
households without IRAs. Aggregating these estimates would suggest small overall impact of 401(k)s, but
his estimates using the overall sample show a somewhat larger positive effect.
The empirical finding that saving incentives may be more likely to raise saving for low earners or low
savers is consistent with a variety of other results in the literature. Gale and Scholz (1994) find similar
results for IRAs, and Gale (1998) finds similar results for employer-provided pensions. In addition, the
mechanism whereby saving incentives might have positive effects on private saving for lower-earning or
lower-saving households but not for higher earners is worth exploring. One possibility is that low-income
households do not hold much in the way of stocks (Carney and Gale 1999, Poterba and Samwick 1999). This
is not terribly surprising given the information and transactions costs, but it may be that 401(k)s raise saving
for this group by providing cheap access to the stock market. Another possibility, exemplified by models
developed in Samwick (1995) and others is tax-preferred, but illiquid retirement saving is a poor substitute
for other saving for households with little wealth who need the saving for precautionary reasons. If so, then
to the extent that low earning households do contribute to such plans, the contributions are more likely to be
new saving. A third possibility is simply that higher earners or high-saving households are simply more
economically sophisticated and hence have both the resources and the wherewithal to take advantage of
sheltering strategies that allow them to capture the tax benefits of 401(k)s without sacrificing living
standards.
Finally, as we have emphasized in earlier papers (Engen and Gale 1995, 1997), our findings point
toward potentially important links between housing equity and financial assets in determining the adequacy of

34

saving for retirement. This result is consistent with findings in Poterba and Samwick (1997, page 25), who
conclude that debt and borrowing behavior are important factors in understanding financial preparation for
retirement, and these links deserve further scrutiny on the part of economists.
