    "abstract": "\n\nEach of the world's largest retailers---Walmart, Carrefour, Tesco, and Metro---entered China after 1995.  Their subsequent expansion in China may have influenced Chinese exports through two channels. First,  they may have enhanced bilateral exports between the retailers' Chinese operations and destination countries also served by stores in the retailers' networks. Second, Chinese city-level exports to all destinations may have grown if multinational retailer presence enhanced the general export capabilities of local suppliers. Evidence from Chinese city-level retail goods exports supports the capability hypothesis as the expansion of Chinese city exports follows the geographic expansion of the retailers' Chinese stores and global procurement centers.\n\n",
