We describe the behavior of the (relative) Pareto weight in a two-country world and explore its interaction with consumption and the real exchange rate.\n\n",

We thank Jarda Borovicka, Riccardo Colacito, and John Stachurski for helpful advice.  We also thank the conference participants, including especially Giancarlo Corsetti, Robert Kollmann, Ayhan Kose, and Ravi Ravikumar.  James Bullard suggested the analogy with wedges.
