Shocking Labor Supply: A Reassessment of the Role of World War II on U.S. Women’s Labor
Supply

NBER Working Paper No. 18676
January 2013
JEL No. J16,J2,N3
ABSTRACT
The most prominent feature of the female labor force across the past hundred years is its enormous
growth. But many believe that the increase was discontinuous. Our purpose is to identify the shortand long-run impacts of WWII on the labor supply of women who were currently married in 1950
and 1960. We use mobilization rates for various groups of men (by age, race, fatherhood) to see whether
there was a wartime impact. We find that an aggregate mobilization rate produces the largest and
most robust impacts on both weeks worked and the labor force participation of married white (non-farm)
women. The impact, moreover, was experienced primarily by women in the top half of the education
distribution. Women who were married but without children during WWII were the group most impacted
by the mobilization rate in 1950, although by 1960 WWII still influenced the labor supply decisions
of them as well as those with children during WWII. We end the paper with a resolution between
the watershed and revisionist views of the role of WWII on female labor supply.

The female labor force in the United States increased greatly across the twentieth century
to the late 1990s. The change was more rapid at some moments than at others and for some age
groups than for others. But for most ages and cohorts the dominant feature of the female labor
force is its striking and large increase across the century. But continuity in the increase may be
an illusion.
In fact, many believe that women’s paid employment was altered inexorably at certain
moments in its history, and the 1940s have been seen as such a watershed decade. Several
reasons have been offered for this presumption. The aggregate participation rate for women has
an upward tick at 1940 and the participation rate for the older group (45 to 54 years old) of
married, white women shows an even greater change in slope (see Fig. 1, Part A). In addition,
changes in the labor force during the wartime period were huge. Around 14 million men were
mobilized for U.S. armed forces duty from 1940 to 1945.1 The male labor force declined by
almost 9 million during the war years whereas the female labor force increased by more than 7
million, an enormous change given that the female labor force stood at 14 million in 1940.2
Another reason to believe there was fundamental change in the social fabric was that the
U.S. government produced well-targeted posters and news reels during World War II (WWII)
entreating women to enter the workforce. The actual accounts of women who were drawn into
the workforce during the war have also spoken to its transformative impact.
But no sooner did the “watershed theory,” as we will call it, get aired that a revisionist
account of the role of WWII emerged.3 Women, to be sure, were recruited during the early
1940s but, according to the revisionist view, many were forced off their jobs at war’s end to
make room for returning GIs. Others left willingly when their husbands came home from service
and still others married at war’s end and left the labor force. Many women who were young
during the early 1940s and were employed in the war years became mothers of the baby boom
and left their jobs to raise families. To many in the revisionist camp, the general propaganda
machine went into reverse gear after VJ-day extolling the virtues of women’s role in the home.
Without longitudinal data on women’s experiences it had been impossible to determine
the veracity of these two opposing interpretations. Were many female workers in 1950 those
1

There were 11.5 million men 18 to 44 years old who were drafted or enlisted at their draft board and
were not deemed to have a deferment. Another 3.1 million volunteered for the services, but not all
volunteers were considered eligible to serve.
2
Employed males decreased by only 3.5 million because the unemployment rate was still high in 1940.
The decrease for men is from the peak in July 1940 to the trough in Jan. 1945; the increase for women is
from the trough in Jan. 1941 to the peak in July 1944. U.S. Bureau of the Census (1947), tables 4 and 5.

who had been drawn in during the war? The answer came from archival records—the surveys
underlying the Palmer report—and overlooked evidence from government reports that enabled a
piecing together of cohort work histories.4
For the group of married women who were 18 to 42 years old in Dec. 1941 and thus 27 to
51 in Jan. 1951, about half of those employed in 1951 were also employed at the end of 1941,
just before the U.S. declared war. And the increase in participation for this cohort was about the
same in the first half of the 1940s decade as in the second half. Among those who first entered
the labor force from the onset of war in Dec. 1941 to March 1944, 46 percent remained in the
labor force to Jan. 1951. The group of WWII entrants accounted for just 20 percent of the
married women 27 to 51 years old who were employed in 1951. From this evidence WWII does
not look like a great watershed in the employment history of women.
Yet, WWII could still have had an effect in the 1940s, although not creating a watershed
moment. Furthermore, the long-run impact of the experience could have been greater still and
the archival source just referenced ends in 1951 and cannot divulge it.
There are several recently unearthed pieces of evidence that argue for a longer-range
impact of WWII on women’s labor supply and a possible return to the watershed view. The first
is that the war’s impact on women’s participation in the 1941 to 1945 years does not appear to
have resulted from increases in real, after-tax wages. Although pre-tax real wages rose, after tax
wages actually fell due to the large increase in taxes.5 Because female employment during the
war soared, a usual explanation that relies on standard increases in the opportunity cost of time
and an expansion in the household budget set would not seem to be correct.
There are many reasons why a standard model of changing budget sets would not be fully
applicable to the early 1940s. Before the war various regulations at the firm and government
levels, termed “marriage bars,” restricted the employment of married women (Goldin 1991b).
Restrictions of this nature were struck down in 1941 in more than 20 states and many at the firm
level were, by and large, left unenforced or abandoned. Unemployment in 1940 stood at almost
15 percent and since labor supply is fairly elastic at the current wage under conditions of high
unemployment, demand increases would not affect the real wage.6 It may not be surprising that
employment soared while real, after-tax wages were fairly constant. But that impact may not be
the main factor that affected women. The reason that employment increased so substantially for
women without an increase in their real wages may be because their labor supply function
shifted to the right.

See Goldin (1991a), who used the manuscripts from the Palmer (1954) surveys.
See Mulligan (1998) and Aldrich (1989). According to Mulligan (table 1) real after-tax wages for
women fell by 4 percent from 1940 to 1944 and then rose by 17 percent from 1944 to 1948.

That possibility is supported by a recent finding about the impact of the war on women’s
employment by Acemoglu, Autor, and Lyle (2004) in a paper that cleverly uses the mobilization
rate by state to identify the impact of the war.7 The mobilization rate, by which is meant the
fraction of males between certain ages who were inducted into the military, varied by state for
many reasons and provides a way to measure the “treatment effect” of the war. The greater the
mobilization rate, the more “treated” are various other groups in the state, the smallest
geographic unit for which these data exist. Acemoglu, Autor and Lyle (hereafter AAL) employ
the mobilization rate to obtain an estimate of the impact of women’s employment on the
aggregate wage structure. In the process of accomplishing that goal, they identify a treatment
effect of the war on female labor supply.
Because the goal of AAL was to assess the impact of female labor supply on the wage
structure, not to estimate the role of the war on women’s labor supply, they used a wide age
range for women and did not disaggregate by other variables such as race, marital status, and
parenthood. And because of that, they used an aggregate mobilization rates and not one that
would have targeted specific groups.
Our purpose is to identify the short- and long-run impacts of WWII on women’s labor
supply for women who were currently married in 1950 and 1960. We term these effects as
“shocking” labor supply and we divide the factors affecting labor supply into those that are
general and that are specific.
The general influence of the war would have affected all women living through the
period. The specific influence of the war would have been experienced by women whose
husbands were in the armed services and away from home. Husbands in the armed services
generally earned less than in their civilian jobs giving rise to an income effect that shifted female
labor supply to the right.8 Perhaps of greater importance is that husbands were often an
impediment to a wife’s working for pay. With so many husbands away, wives could work
outside the home without their protest. As is clear from Table 1, women whose husbands were
away during the war years had twice the employment rate than those of the same age whose
husbands were not away.9 Because fathers had a much lower probability than non-fathers of
serving during the war years, we also consider that factor.

Others who have used the mobilization rate identification include Fernández, Fogli and Olivetti (2004)
and Doepke, Hazan and Maoz (2012).
8
According to Acemoglu, Autor and Lyle (2004, p. 520, fn. 10), “annual military pay in 1944 averaged
$1,811 vs. $2,109 for all full-time civilian workers.”
9
Mulligan (1998), using data from Pidgeon (1944), notes that women whose husbands were “away at
war” also had higher labor force participation before the U.S. declared war. According to Pidgeon,
among women 20 to 44 year old, whose husbands were “away at war” in 1944, 41.5 percent were in the
labor force in 1941 before war was declared. But these women might not have been married in 1941.

Shocking Labor Supply -3-

We use mobilization rates for various groups of men to see whether there was an impact
and whether it was due to the general or specific factors. We focus our attention on women who
were young during the war years (25 to 34 years old in 1950 and 35 to 44 years old in 1960) and
currently married in 1950 or 1960 since they would have been more constrained by social norms
before the war and more highly treated by the mobilization rate.
We find that most of the impact was general in nature, meaning that the aggregate
mobilization rate produces the largest and most robust impact on both weeks worked and the
labor force participation of women. The impact, moreover, was experienced primarily by
women in the top half of the education distribution. The effects we find are for 1950, which we
term the short-run impact, and for 1960, which we term a longer-run effect on women who were
married in the war years. Women who were married but without children during WWII were
most impacted by the mobilization rate in 1950. By 1960 WWII still influenced the labor supply
decisions of these women as well as those with children during WWII. We end the paper with a
resolution between the two competing theories of the role of WWII on female labor supply
during and after the war.
I.

Identifying the “Shocking” of Female Labor Supply by WWII

Before the 1940s married women were considerably constrained in their labor supply.
Social norms and “marriage bars,” at local, state, and federal governmental levels and in various
white collar positions, circumscribed their ability to work outside the home for pay.10 Surveys
show that these norms loosened during the 1940s and WWII may have demonstrated to
husbands, other relatives, and community busy-bodies that women could work outside the home
without loss of social status and personal harm. The fact that real after-tax wages did not
increase during the war years, yet the number of female workers soared, suggests that there was
an outward shift in the labor supply function of various groups of women.
The war could have changed the reservation wage of women for several reasons. All
women, regardless of marital and motherhood status, could have reduced their reservation wage
for the good of the nation. That is what we have termed the general impact. For women with
husbands who were inducted, their reservation wage would have been lowered further by their
decreased household income. If their husbands had previously been a barrier to their
employment their reservation wage would have been lowered even further while their husbands
were no longer at home. These effects are what we mean by the specific impact of the war.
Rather, they might have gotten married when their future husbands were drafted and their husbands may
have been drafted early because they had no dependents. Similarly, these women might not have had
children in 1944 and that could have been why their husbands were drafted or volunteered. The point is
that we do not know whether the difference is due to selection or treatment.
10
Goldin (1991b) discusses marriage bars. On social norms and data from the Gallup polls, see
Fernández, Fogli and Olivetti (2004, fn. 6).

Married women with children, however, would have been impacted less by WWII than
other women in part because their husbands were drafted at a lower rate. But, in addition, it was
highly unusual for women with young children to work even during the war for a host of factors.
The shift in female labor supply during the war could have been temporary or could have
been more permanent. We address whether women who went through the war experienced an
impact on their labor supply and whether the impact was a lasting effect because they were
treated. For those who were married during the war we also address whether they experienced
an impact and a lasting effect because their husbands were treated. The enormous increase in the
demand for female labor during WWII may have “shocked” women’s labor supply beyond the
WWII period and had more permanent effects.
A. World War II Mobilization Rates
Mobilization in the U.S. began Sept. 16, 1940 with the Selective Training and Service
Act, which called for the registration of all men 21 to 35 years old. Deferments could be granted
based on dependents, occupation, and fitness to serve. Registration was extended five additional
times including, most notably, Feb. 16, 1942, which added 20 year olds and 37 to 44 year olds
and June 30, 1942, which added 18 to 20 year olds.11
Wives were initially considered dependents as were children if born before Sept. 15,
1942 (that is, if conceived before Pearl Harbor). The wife deferment ended April 12, 1943 and
the automatic child deferment ended Dec. 11, 1943. But many other deferments still existed.
Certain agriculture and war-industry occupations were considered deferments and some men,
deemed IV-F, were exempt because of physical and mental disabilities. On April 21, 1944,
however, almost all deferments were eliminated.
But whatever official rules existed, fathers were considered draftable only after others in
the local draft board pool were exhausted.12 The mobilization rates for fathers are considerably
lower than for other groups.
To identify the treatment effect of WWII on women, we produce mobilization rates from
the Selective Service bulletins for several groups of men by race, age, and parental status as of
August 1, 1945 (see Table A.1). The ones we use here are as follows. An aggregate rate for all
18 to 44 year olds, termed MOB is almost identical to the one AAL use. It includes men of all
races and parental statuses.13 We also use a mobilization rate for white men 18 to 37 years old
11

See also Acemoglu, Autor and Lyle (2004) on mobilization during WWII.
U.S. Public Law 197, approved Dec. 5, 1943, directed draft boards to have non-fathers report for
induction before (pre-Pearl Harbor) fathers. See U.S. Selective Service (1948a, p. 22).
13
The main difference between our aggregate measure and that used by AAL is that they use inductions
as of Jan. 1946 whereas our rates are all as of Aug. 1, 1945.

(white MOB) and another for fathers 18 to 37 years old (father MOB) to identify the existence of
specific treatments. Of these mobilization rates the aggregate one (MOB) generally performs the
best. That for whites performs almost as well and because our observations are for white women
it could indicate a specific effect. That for fathers, to identify the impact on married women with
children during the war, does just as poorly for this group as the general one probably because
married women with young children were simply immovable by 1950.
A few clarifications about the draft, mobilization, induction, and enlistment are in order.
Men were drafted by their local draft boards of which there were about 6,500 nationwide.
Alternatively, they could volunteer (enlist) at their local draft boards or through one of the
Armed Services. When they volunteered through a Service, information on their race and
parental status was not collected. Therefore, when we use the data by race, we cannot include
volunteers who entered through a Service. But since there were almost no blacks who
volunteered through a Service (probably because of the coordination difficulties of having a
segregated army), we add all Service volunteers to the white enlisted numbers to get the white
total. Fathers are also given for all but the Service volunteers. But it was rare for a father to
have volunteered with the Services, so these mobilization rates are probably accurate.
Our estimation relies on the fact that mobilization rates varied by state. AAL
demonstrate that mobilization rates depended on the factors that led to deferments in each of the
states (fraction of males with a farm occupation, fraction blacks, and fraction German). Quotas
were set from the number of Registrants available for service (I-A) plus those already serving (IC). Thus, the higher the number of deferments, the lower would be the mobilization rate since
Registrants include those with deferments. Within those bounds relatively fewer fathers would
allow the fathers to get greater draft protection from non-fathers through draft board preferences.
More fathers would mean less protection and a greater chance of a father’s being drafted. The
most important effects are from the fraction of the male population in farm occupations and the
fraction black.14
The aggregate mobilization rate for 18 to 44 year olds has a total mean of 0.462 and
varies by state from 0.400 to 0.536; the mobilization rate for 18 to 37 year old white men has a
mean of 0.616 and varies from 0.504 to 0.720, and the mobilization rate for all fathers has a
mean of just 0.168 and ranges from 0.112 to 0.225.15 These rates are not strongly correlated.
The rates for fathers and the aggregate have a raw correlation coefficient of 0.298 and that
between the white rate and the aggregate is 0.688. (Mobilization rates by state are given in Table
A.1 and the analysis of the state-level determinants of the alternative rates is in Table A.2.)

14

Note that the fraction German mops up the rest, mainly in Wisconsin, and is not an important
determinant of the mobilization rate.
15
These data are for our sample and exclude individuals born or residing in Nevada and D.C.

B. Identification Strategy
The idea behind our identification strategy is that various groups of (white) women who
went through the war may have been treated differently by the mobilization of men. All were
affected by the increase in demand for their own labor in local labor markets (here U.S. states)
and by a desire to aid the nation in its war effort. But some were treated further. Those who
were married at the time of increased mobilization were affected by the induction of their
husbands. They would have been affected by the reduction in their family income and also by
their increased independence. Those who had children would have been less impacted by the
mobilization of their husbands because the induction rate for fathers was considerably less than
for non-fathers of the same age, and women with children had low labor force participation rates
for various reasons.
We have two main samples and two outcome measures. In each case the treated women
went through the WWII years, 1941 to 1945, in one of three demographic circumstances:
married with children; married without children; and unmarried.16 One of the samples is white
(non-farm) married women who were 25 to 34 years old in 1950 and thus ranging from 16 to 29
years old from 1941 to 1945, the years of U.S. involvement in WWII.17 The control for this
group is white (non-farm) married women in 1940 similarly situated demographically during a
“pseudo” WWII period in the 1930s. The other sample and its control group are likewise
constructed for white (non-farm) married women 35 to 44 years old in 1960 and 1940.18
The two outcomes we analyze are weeks worked and labor force participation. We use
the 1940, 1950, and 1960 IPUMS of the U.S. population census. Note that both for the 1950
sample and for 1960 the women are 25 to 34 years old in 1950. We first investigate if the
treatment effect of WWII existed over the short run to 1950 and then if the treatment effect of
WWII had a more lasting effect on female labor supply to 1960.
We estimate the treatment effect of the war where the dosage is measured by either the
aggregate mobilization rate or by a mobilization rate specific to the demographic groups by state
of birth. For all women the specific mobilization rate is that for white men 18 to 37 years old
since these men were most likely to have been their husbands during the war or to have become
their husbands after the war. For those with children during the war, another specific
16

A trivial fraction of unmarried women had children in both years.
We select white women because black women’s labor force participation was high before the war and
many were employed in agricultural occupations, excluded here. For selection rules see notes to Table 3.
18
The 35 to 44 year old women in 1960 may differ from those in the same demographic circumstances
who were 25 to 34 years old in 1950 for several reasons. Because we use first marriages that lasted to
1960 women who remarried or became widows will not be included. In addition, it is possible that a
child born before or during the WWII years already left the parent’s household by 1960 and had no other
siblings born in that period. If so, we will misidentify the demographic group of that woman.
17

Shocking Labor Supply -7-

mobilization rate is that of fathers 18 to 37 years old.19 We find that the aggregate mobilization
rate provides the most significant results, that for white men (18 to 37 years old) yields
qualitatively similar results, but that for fathers generally does not have much of an effect.
Covariates identified by AAL are included to account for differences in mobilization by
state that may be correlated with the outcome variables such as fraction of male employment in
agriculture (fraction farm) and the fraction black. The mobilization rates are given by state of
birth to ensure greater exogeneity; dummies for state of birth and age are also included.
The general version of the estimating equation is:
(1)
where
is an outcome, either weeks worked or labor force participation for person i in year t
and having state of birth s.
are state of birth dummies,
is a year dummy for either τ =1950
or 1960, and
are covariates for woman i such as number of children and age dummies.
are state of birth covariates such as fraction of male employment in farm occupations,
fraction black, and mean level of education of the adult population all as of 1940. The
coefficient of greatest interest is , that on the interaction of the year dummy and the relevant
mobilization rate (
) in the individual’s state of birth.
When we use the three demographic groups (married with children, married without
children, or single), which is the case on which we will concentrate, we add main effects, an
interaction with the year dummy, and another with the mobilization rate and the year dummy. It
is this triple difference on which we will focus. Of great importance to our results is that we
divide the sample roughly in half by those who have graduated from high school and those who
have not, and we estimate the equation for each group separately.
The use of the mobilization rate is valid only if it is not related to pre-WWII outcomes.
AAL demonstrate this in their paper and we do so as well (see Table A.3) since our sample
differs from theirs and our mobilization rates are somewhat different as well. We follow their
useful technique of dividing states into three groups of equal size termed low, medium and high
mobilization rate states. As can be seen in Table A.3, weeks worked and labor force
participation rates for our sample of 25 to 34 year old and 35 to 44 year old women do not vary
consistently by the grouping of mobilization rates in the state of birth for 1940.20

19

We do not have a mobilization rate of fathers by race.
Means for the outcomes are not statistically significant from each other across low, medium, and high
mobilization states.

II. Results and Interpretation
A. Impact of the Mobilization Rate on Labor Supply Outcomes
We first analyze the short run impact of WWII on weeks worked and labor force
participation for young women, 25 to 34 years old, who were currently married in 1950. A key
feature of the outcome variables to note in Table 2 is that average weeks of work for this age
group did not increase much, if at all, from 1940 to 1950 even though labor force participation
increased somewhat (see also Fig. 1, part A). One reason for the disparity is that mean weeks of
work conditional on participation for these women fell from 1940 to 1950, an indicator of the
emergence of part-time, part-year work for married women (see Table A.3). The late 1940s and
early 1950s saw the growth of jobs that employed women with household responsibilities.
Firms, particularly in the retail sales sector, adjusted work schedules to accommodate a newly
expanded labor force and to expand it further.
Women who were 25 to 34 in 1950 appear to have been impacted by WWII, as can be
seen from the coefficients on the triple differences in Table 3. Although the coefficients in cols.
(1) and (3) for less-educated women have fairly large standard errors and are occasionally of the
wrong sign, those for women with schooling above the median level, as in cols. (2) and (4), are
positive, large and more precisely estimated for both weeks worked and labor force participation.
The finding that the more-educated group was impacted, whereas the lesser-educated group was
generally not, is a robust result and found in virtually all of our estimations.
For the group of 35 to 44 year old white, married women in 1960 we similarly find that
the largest and most consistently significant results are for the more-educated group of women
(see Table 4, cols. 2 and 4). For both weeks worked and labor force participation the coefficients
on the triple differences have the largest and most significant relationship to the mobilization
rate. Married women 35 to 44 years old in 1960 experienced a substantial increase in both weeks
worked and labor force participation relative to their demographic counterparts in 1940 (see
Table 2). Note that even though these women are the same individuals as the 25 to 34 year old
group in 1950, as the mothers of the baby boom they were more able to enter the labor force
when their children were older.21
B. Interpretation of the Role of WWII
In interpreting Tables 3 and 4 we use only the results for the more-educated group of
women and we compare states with low mobilization rates to those with high mobilization

21

They are not necessarily identical individuals since we cannot accurately identify women who were
married in the 1941 to 1945 period unless that marriage survived to the later census date.

rates.22 We use a simple difference metric in this regard: the mobilization rate of the median
state in the “high” group minus that of the median state in the “low” group. The measure is
equivalent to the difference between the rate of the eighth highest and the eighth lowest states by
mobilization rate. Considering the aggregate mobilization rate for all men 18 to 44 years old the
state difference metric is 6.8 percentage points. For the mobilization rate for white men 18 to 37
years old the difference metric is 5.2 percentage points.
Consider, first, the Table 3 results on weeks worked for the 25 to 34 year old women in
1950. For those who were married and without children (Table 3, col. 2), the effect of a change
in the mobilization rate of 6.8 percentage points is 2.9 weeks (= 43.33  0.068), or about a 28
percent increase compared with the 1940 or 1950 mean for the group (around 10 or 11 weeks).23
The change for more-educated women who were not married during WWII is 2.6 weeks (= 37.95
 0.068) or about an 18 percent increase from the 1940 mean for the group of 14 weeks.
The mean high school graduate woman married during WWII but having no children had
one young child by 1950. Although her labor supply measured by weeks in 1950 was positively
impacted by a higher mobilization rate during the war, this demographic group of women
actually had lower weeks of work by 1950 (see the double interaction with year in Table 3).
Recall that the impact of the mobilization rates on 25 to 34 year old women in1950 will largely
take the form of labor force reallocations since weeks worked did not increase and participation
increased slightly. We find that women from states with high mobilization rates increased their
weeks worked and their labor force participation to a greater extent than did those from states
with low mobilization rates.
Women who were married with children during the war would have had less ability to be
impacted directly from the increase in demand for their labor. For the more-educated women the
coefficient is smaller (and less-precisely estimated) for these women than for the other groups.
In contrast, those who were already married during the war but had no children would have had
the double impact of having an increased demand for their labor and husbands who were most
likely away in the armed forces. That interpretation seems to be borne out when we use the
aggregate mobilization rate, as in Table 3 and also when we use the mobilization rate for white
men 18 to 37 years old (as in Table A.4).
We find similar results for the labor force participation rate measure but with some
differences. We find, as we did previously, that more-educated women were impacted to a
22

We have chosen this hypothetical rather than ponder the imponderable of not having WWII. Note that
we are always referring to the mobilization rate in a woman’s state of birth rather than state of residence.
Using state of residence instead does not noticeably change the results.
23
The mobilization rate for white men 18 to 37 years old produces a slightly lower impact for married
women without children during WWII. Using the 5.2 percentage point metric together with a coefficient
of 33.82 yields 1.8 weeks.

Shocking Labor Supply -10-

greater extent by the mobilization rate than were the less-educated women. When we use the
aggregate mobilization rate we also find that those who were married but had no children during
WWII had the largest effect. The impact of changing the mobilization rate by 0.068 is 0.065 (=
0.96  0.068) or about a 30 percent increase using either the 1940 or 1950 participation rate
(about 22 percent). The impact is a bit smaller for married women with children but because
participation rates for that group are lower the effect as a fraction of the participation rate is
larger. The coefficient for women who were not married during WWII is smaller and less
significant than for those who were married with children.24
Finally, and perhaps most important, are the results in Table 4 for women 35 to 44 years
old in 1940 and 1960. These demonstrate persistence for more-educated women, particularly
those who were married during the WWII years. In this case women who were married during
WWII with or without children show the greatest longer-run impact from changes in the
mobilization rate. The finding holds for weeks worked and for the labor force participation rate.
For the magnitude of the effect, we again use the difference metric. For married women
in the higher-educated group with children, the coefficient in Table 4, col. (2) implies an increase
of 2.9 weeks (= 42.7  0.068) or about 24 percent of the 1940 and 1960 average of about 12
weeks. The estimate for married women without children is a bit lower and results in an increase
of 2.2 weeks or 20 percent of the 1940 and 1960 average.
Similarly the coefficient for the labor force participation of the more-educated women
with children during WWII implies a change of 4.6 percentage points (= 0.68  0.068) or 17
percent of the 1940 to 1960 mean of 0.28 for the group. The impact for the married women
without children is about the same.
In summary, the impact of WWII as indicated by the relationship of labor supply
outcomes to the mobilization rate is found for both weeks worked and labor force participation.
It is generally strong in 1950 for white women who did not have children during WWII and it is
also strong by 1960 for those who were married during WWII, with or without children. In all
cases, the impact is almost entirely among those who were more educated. About half of the
women were in the more-educated grouping and about one-third of that group were married
without children and another quarter of the women were not married during WWII.
Because the aggregate data in Figure 1 show that the older age groups of women had the
largest increase in participation after the 1940s we also examine the relationship between labor
supply measures and the aggregate mobilization rate for women 35 to 44 and 45 to 49 years old.
24

The finding on those who were unmarried during the war is not robust to the use of the alternative
mobilization rate. All three groups show a response to changes in the mobilization rate of white men 18
to 37 years old (see Table A.4).

Shocking Labor Supply -11-

In this case we do not distinguish among the three groups since currently married women who
were in the forties in 1950 would have a small probability of being unmarried in 1940.25 As in
the previous analysis, we find an impact only for women with at least a high school diploma (see
Table A.5). The effects we find are of a similar order of magnitude for women 35 to 49 years
old but we identify no effect for women older.
We have performed many robustness checks to see if the results stand up to changing the
sample and the mobilization rate used. Our findings in brief are that the results are robust to
assigning mobilization rates by state of residence and to including a full interaction of individuallevel controls with a year dummy. Excluding southern states made the 1940 to 1950 results
somewhat larger, although those for 1940 to 1960 were less robust. Using an indicator whether
weeks were at least equal to 20 left the results basically unchanged, probably because most
working women in 1940 were employed a significant fraction of the year.
Some variants of the mobilization rate variable imply less of an impact than that given by
the aggregate rate and that for white men 18 to 37 years old. The rates for fathers and for men in
particular age groups produce large standard errors, although the results for women 35 to 44
years old in 1950 are significant for all mobilization rates. In sum, we view the checks as
indicating robustness to changes in the sample and to the use of some of the mobilization rates,
but not all, for both the 1940 to 1950 and 1940 to 1960 estimations.
In almost all of our estimations more-educated women display the greatest, and often the
only, impact of the mobilization rate. One may wonder whether states with high mobilization
rates had an occupational mix in 1940 that produces this result. We do not find that states with
high mobilization rates had a very different fraction of their female labor forces employed in
office, retail sales, managerial, and professional occupations in 1940 relative to those with low
mobilization rates. Although the fraction in the clerical category is lower in low mobilization
states, the growth from 1940 to 1950 is much greater. We do not find that adding state of
residence fixed effects, region fixed effects, and fraction of the female labor force in white-collar
occupations in 1940 (by state of birth) makes any difference and we are already including the
fraction in agricultural occupations (by state of birth).
III. Concluding Remarks on Shocking Female Labor Supply
Did WWII have a “shocking” effect on women’s labor supply as the “watershed theory”
posits, or did it have no persistent impact as the “revisionists” would assert? Our work allows an
integration of the two views of WWII and women’s labor supply.

25

Most would have had children by the WWII years but if their children had left home by 1950 we will
not be able to know their ages. That possibility is especially severe for the women in their forties.

Shocking Labor Supply -12-

By identifying the impact of WWII using the mobilization rate instrument we find that
states with higher mobilization rates did experience an increase in female labor supply measured
in terms of weeks worked and labor force participation. The impact, moreover, is perceptible
only among the upper half of women by level of schooling. In addition, the shorter-run impact
of WWII was greatest among those who did not have children during WWII whereas the longer
run impact was greatest for those with children during WWII. In almost all cases the impact of
mobilization on weeks and participation for the higher-educated group was substantial, around
20 percent of the average level for the period considered. But the same measures of labor supply
for women with schooling levels below the median were generally not impacted by the
mobilization rate.
How do these findings bear on the question posed? To better interpret our findings we
use a survey of working women in 1951—the Palmer survey—that retrospectively followed their
work histories from 1940. Women 25 to 44 years old in 1951who entered the workforce from
1940 to 1944 were probably “shocked” by the increased demand for female labor during WWII.
But which of these women had a persistent effect of the “shock”?
The Palmer survey allows us to observe the occupations of these women and their
education. Of great importance is that the occupations these women had in 1944 greatly
depended on their level of education. Among those with at least a high school diploma, almost
80 percent were in white-collar jobs. But for those with less than a high school diploma just 25
percent were in white-collar position. About 75 percent were in blue-collar jobs and the vast
majority of these were in manufacturing. By 1950 these women’s occupations were not much
different than in 1944, except that manufacturing positions decreased and service occupations
took their place among the lesser-educated group.
Although the survey does not allow us to trace women who entered the labor force in
1944 but did not continue to 1951, it provides clues to why the higher-educated women would
have had a persistent impact from the “shock.” The lower-educated women were
disproportionately pulled into manufacturing positions to 1944 and many probably did not
remain in them because of the factors mentioned in the revisionist literature. Women were often
unwelcome in manufacturing industries; unions were resistant to change; and the work may have
been altered to accommodate women during WWII but was not after. The more-educated group,
however, entered sectors that enabled women to remain to 1950 and beyond.
Another important finding of this work is that the women who had the most persistent
impact from WWII may not have been those who were in the labor force in 1950. Married
women with children during WWII were impacted by the war experience but could not easily
express it when their children were young. By 1960 their kids were grown and the more
Shocking Labor Supply -13-

educated in this cohort entered white-collar positions. Their entrance, it seems, was greater in
states that had more demand for women during WWII.
Our work helps reconcile the watershed and revisionist views of WWII. Women’s labor
supply was altered by the war. But the labor supply of only some women remained impacted in
the shorter and longer-term. Women whose labor supply was shifted appear to have been those
who entered white-collar positions from 1940 to 1944. For some of them, WWII involved a
“shock” to labor supply that had persistent effects.

Notes: Our sample includes all white, married women in their first marriage, not living in
institutional group quarters and not employed in farming. The restriction to being in a first
marriage is necessary to grouping women by their marital status and determining the presence of
children during the “WWII” years (1941 to 1945 for 1950 and 1931 to 1935 for 1940). Only
women born in and residing in the continental U.S., excluding D.C. and Nevada, are included.
Women are excluded if the difference between their age and that of their eldest child is less than
12 years. We use sample line weights even when the dependent variable is available for
everyone because some of the key variables used to create the demographic groups are available
only for sample line women. In particular, the information on the number of times an individual
was married is asked only of ever-married sample line women in 1940 and ever-married sample
line persons in 1950. The age at marriage is available only for ever-married sample line women
in 1940, and the 1950 information on marriage duration is also only available for ever-married
sample line persons. Women with children during “WWII” are those living with an eldest child
at least 5 years old at the time of the census. We drop Nevada for the same reasons as do
Acemoglu, Autor and Lyle (2004, p. 511), that the state underwent a large population change
during the 1940s and the base population in 1940 was small.

Sources: U.S. Selective Service System (1946, 1947, 1948b, 1950).
Notes: Col. (1) all inductions and volunteers equal to cumulative inductions as of August 1, 1945
and cumulative enlistments as of Sept. 1, 1945 divided by all registrants; col. (2) is equal to all
inductions for white men plus all volunteers divided by all white registrants of the appropriate
age group; col. (3) numerator is fathers inducted and enlisted and denominator is all father
registrants under the assumption that there were no father volunteers. The calculation of col. (2)
implicitly assumes that all men who volunteered through the Services were white. That appears
to have been the case: “practically all of the men enlisted by the Army and the Navy were
whites” (U.S. Selective Service 1948a, p. 101).

worked; Weeks | LFP=1 = weeks worked conditional on labor force participation being one.
Note that weeks worked is for the year preceding the census whereas labor force participation is
as of the census week.
Mobilization rate categorization is: Low: Georgia, North Dakota, North Carolina, South Dakota,
South Carolina, Wisconsin, Louisiana, Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi, Virginia, Tennessee,
Kentucky, Indiana, Michigan, and Iowa. Medium: Missouri, Texas, Nebraska, Minnesota,
Maryland, Delaware, Vermont, Illinois, Florida, New Mexico, Ohio, West Virginia, New York,
Wyoming, and Oklahoma. High: Kansas, Montana, Connecticut, Arizona, Colorado, New
Jersey, Idaho, California, Maine, Washington, Pennsylvania, Utah, New Hampshire, Oregon,
Rhode Island, and Massachusetts. Low ranges from 0.40 to 0.44; Medium from 0.441 to 0.479;
High from 0.48 to 0.536. See Table A.1 for mobilization rates used here.
