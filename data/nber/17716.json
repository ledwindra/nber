    "abstract": "\n\nRevolutionary transformations of industry and trade occurred from 1985 to the late-1990s - the regionalisation of supply chains. Before 1985, successful industrialisation meant building a domestic supply chain. Today, industrialisers join supply chains and grow rapidly because offshored production brings elements that took Korea and Taiwan decades to develop domestically. These changes have not been fully reflected in \"high development theory\" - a lacuna that may lead to misinterpretation of data and inattention to important policy questions.\n\n",
