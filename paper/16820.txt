ABSTRACT
Perhaps the most striking feature of "crowdfunding" is the broad geographic dispersion of investors
in small, early-stage projects. This contrasts with existing theories that predict entrepreneurs and investors
will be co-located due to distance-sensitive costs. We examine a crowdfunding setting that connects
artist-entrepreneurs with investors over the internet for financing musical projects. The average distance
between artists and investors is about 3,000 miles, suggesting a reduced role for spatial proximity.
Still, distance does play a role. Within a single round of financing, local investors invest relatively
early, and they appear less responsive to decisions by other investors. We show this geography effect
is driven by investors who likely have a personal connection with the artist-entrepreneur ("family and
friends"). Although the online platform seems to eliminate most distance-related economic frictions
such as monitoring progress, providing input, and gathering information, it does not eliminate social-related
frictions.

Introduction

Perhaps the most striking characteristic of crowdfunding is the geographic dispersion of investors. For example, in our data from a crowdfunding website that facilitates investments in
early-stage musicians seeking financing, we find a mean distance between artist-entrepreneur
and investor of approximately 3,000 miles.
Although distant investors are common for publicly traded companies, theory predicts
that investors in early stage entrepreneurial ventures will tend to be local. That is because
gathering information, monitoring progress, and providing input are particularly important
for investors in early stage ventures and the costs of these activities are sensitive to distance.
Most empirical evidence to date supports these claims (Tribus 1970, Florida and Kenney
1988, Florida and Smith 1993, Lerner 1995, Sorenson and Stuart 2001, Powell, Koput, Bowie,
and Smith-Doerr 2002, Zook 2002, Mason 2007).
Specifically, Sorenson and Stuart (2005) report that the average distance between lead
VC and target firm is approximately 70 miles. Similarly, Sohl (1999) and Wong (2002) report
that angel investors locate close to the entrepreneurs they finance (more than 50% are within
half a day of travel).
The geographic dispersion of investment evident in our data implies that crowdfunding
in our setting largely overcomes the distance-related economic frictions usually associated
with financing entrepreneurial ventures. That is not because the artist-entrepreneurs seeking
financing on this site are not early stage. To the contrary, they are unsigned artists seeking
capital to record their first album. Most are young, have limited reputations as artists or
entrepreneurs, and appear to have minimal resources.
Instead, it appears that the online platform provides an environment purposely designed
for early stage entrepreneurs where they can showcase prototypes of their music, present a
business plan outlining how they will spend their funds, and directly pitch their project to a

1

community of online investors. In this way, and consistent with prior research in retail and
advertising that examines how the online setting allows people to overcome offline barriers
to market transactions (Choi and Bell 2010, Brynjolfsson, Hu, and Rahman 2009, Goldfarb
and Tucker 2010), the platform can help reduce market frictions associated with geographic
distance.
Although the role of geography appears to be greatly diminished in our data when we
consider aggregate investment at the end of the funding process, an important distinction
between local and distant investors comes into sharp relief when we examine investment
patterns over time within a single round of financing. We employ a difference-in-differencelike approach to compare first the difference between local and distant investors in terms of
their propensity to invest in a given period and then how this difference changes with the
publicly visible investment decisions of others. We find that the timing of distant, but not
local, investments is very responsive to the investment decisions of others.
Why might local investors differ so greatly from distant investors in their responsiveness
to the investment decisions of others? The entrepreneurial finance literature makes frequent
reference to the role of family and friends (F&F) as an important source of capital for
early stage ventures.1 Parker (2009) reports that 31% of start-ups’ funds come from family
and friends. Researchers have emphasized family and friends’ informational advantages
concerning the quality of the entrepreneur. For example, Cumming and Johan (2009) assert
that “Apart from the founding entrepreneur’s savings, family and friends [...] are a common
source of capital for earliest-stage entrepreneurial firms. An entrepreneur without a track
record typically has an easier time raising this type of capital because these investors will
have known the entrepreneur for a long time. In other words, information asymmetries faced
1

Despite the acknowledged importance of F&F, there are surprisingly few empirical studies focussed on
this form of investment, likely owing to a paucity of data. However, as Cumming and Johan (2009) note,
“Recent efforts spurred by the Kaufmann Foundation have begun to fill this gap, but there is significant
work to be done in gathering systematic data.”

2

by [family and friends] are lower than those faced by other sources of capital.” Given the
local nature of social networks (Hampton and Wellman 2002), these family and friends are
disproportionately likely to be local.
We code each investor-entrepreneur pair with an indicator variable for “family and
friends” (F&F) based on particular behavioral traits they exhibit on the website (and check
robustness using information from seven entrepreneurs who specifically identified their friends
and family among their investors). We find that F&F are disproportionately co-located with
the entrepreneur, although, importantly, there are also many local investors who are not
F&F and many F&F investors who are distant. We then apply another “difference” to our
empirical analysis, comparing how the effect of other investors’ investment decisions on the
propensity to invest in a given period is mediated by distance after controlling for F&F. The
distance effect disappears.
We interpret this result as implying that the crowdfunding platform eliminates most
distance-related economic frictions normally associated with financing early stage projects,
such as acquiring information (e.g., local reputation, stage presence), monitoring progress,
and providing input.2 However, it does not eliminate frictions associated with the type of
information about the entrepreneur that is more likely to be held by personally connected
individuals (e.g., tendency to persevere, recover from setbacks, succeed in other endeavors).
This interpretation emphasizing the importance of interpersonal relations in entrepreneurial
finance is consistent with the findings of Nanda and Khanna (2010), who report that crossborder social networks play a particularly key role when access to capital is especially difficult.
These results lead us to speculate that there may be path dependency in the process of
accessing distant investors online. To the extent that distant investors disproportionately
rely on information revealed in the investment decisions of others, friends and family might
2

In the following section we point out that although “investors” on crowd-funding sites may have philanthropic or other utility-seeking motivations that are not strictly pecuniary, they are still faced with allocating
scarce resources and, as the literature on philanthropy suggests, are influenced by similar transaction costs.

play an important role in making early investments that generate that information. Conti,
Thursby, and Rothaermel (2010) argue that investments by family and friends can signal the
entrepreneurial commitment to the venture. If true in the crowdfunding setting, this would
imply a limitation to the “equal access for all” potential of the internet. Communications
technologies enable entrepreneurs from anywhere to access capital globally, but in reality
only those entrepreneurs with a sufficient base of offline support may be able to do so.
Although crowdfunding is presently small in terms of overall economic activity, it is
growing in both the variety of sectors to which is applied (e.g., music, sports, video games,
education, retail) and the overall value of transactions (Lawton and Marom 2010). Crowdfunding systems enable users to make investments in various types of projects and ventures,
often in small amounts, outside of a regulated exchange, using online social media platforms that facilitate direct interaction between investors as well as with the individual(s)
raising funds. To our knowledge this is the first empirical examination of the geography of
crowdfunding.3

Empirical Setting

2.1

Sellaband

Sellaband is an Amsterdam-based, online platform that enables unsigned musicians to raise
financing to produce an album. Launched on August 15, 2006, it was one of the first mainstream websites of its kind and has been referred to as the “granddaddy of crowdfunding”
3

There are several interesting papers on the peer-to-peer lending site Prosper.com. However, none address
the spatial dimension of transactions. Perhaps the most related of these, Freedman and Jin (2010), focuses
on complementarity between endorsements and monetary commitments. While this work does not address
the issue of geography, it does look at online networks. Specifically, Freedman and Jin focus on the role of
online social groups in supporting online borrowers, which is complementary to our focus on offline social
ties (“friends and family”) influencing the financing of online entrepreneurs. Also related is Zhang and Liu
(2010), who examine when cumulative investment serves as a quality signal for future investments. Less
directly related, Pope and Sydnor (2010) use Prosper.com as an empirical setting to study the effect of race
on peer-to-peer lending.

4

(Kappel 2009). At the time of our data, the Sellaband website worked as follows:4
Musical artists set up a profile page on Sellaband, at no charge, where they include a
photo, bio, links, blog postings, and up to three demo songs.5 Investors search the website,
learn about artist-entrepreneurs, listen to their demos and, if they choose, buy one or more
shares in an artist’s future album at $10 per share. Investors see information posted by the
artist as well as how much financing the artist has raised to date. Figure 1 provides a picture
of a typical artist profile. Funds raised are held in escrow and may not be accessed until the
artist has sold 5,000 shares (raising $50,000). Upon raising $50,000, the artist may spend
those funds according to a plan they develop that is approved by Sellaband to record their
album. As they incur expenses, they send vendor invoices to Sellaband for payment. After
the album is completed, the revenues from album sales are split equally three ways between
the artist, investors, and Sellaband. Investors also receive a compact disc (CD). During our
period of observation, approximately three years, 34 artists raised the full $50,000.
The individuals and groups posting their music on Sellaband are typically early-stage
artists who have never signed a contract with a record label, recorded a professional album,
or performed live outside of local pubs or cafes. At this stage of their careers, their income
from live shows and music sales is negligible. In other words, these individuals face many
of the same financing challenges and constraints as entrepreneurs in many other settings.
Artists on Sellaband use it to raise capital to finance the recording of an album. They market
themselves, develop a budget, create a plan for promoting their product, and raise financing.
Sellaband therefore provides a platform for artists to engage in entrepreneurial activities with
a community of investors. For these reasons, we refer to them as “entrepreneurs” throughout
4

The website has changed substantially since September 2009, reducing the focus on early-stage artists,
limiting the ability to receive a monetary return, and allowing more flexibility to artists in the amount they
can raise and how they can use their funds.
5
A “demo,” short for “demonstration recording,” is an informal recording made solely for the purpose
of pitching a song rather than for release. It is effectively a prototype of the song that they plan to later
record professionally. It is a way for musicians to approximate their ideas and convey them to record labels,
producers, or other artists (Passman 2009).

the paper.
Similarly, in describing our results we refer to the people providing funds as “investors”.
Of course, many of these investors may also have philanthropic or other utility seeking motivations. Some crowdfunding platforms are explicitly designed with philanthropic intentions.
For example, Kiva, a platform which focuses on lending to entrepreneurs in developing countries, does not allow lenders to charge interest and thus provides no mechanism for earning
a return on their capital. On Sellaband, a platform designed to accommodate profit-seeking
investment motivations by way of a revenue sharing agreement that is tied to the level of
investment, individuals may also be motivated by non-pecuniary returns such as utility from
being philanthropic to help artists achieve their goals. However, even philanthropicallymotivated individuals must allocate scarce resources. While they may not be focused on a
pecuniary return on investment, they are focused on some type of return on their investment
and therefore are motivated to select wisely amongst many projects competing for their
donations. As Stanley Katz states in his Handbook chapter on philanthropy in the arts
(Katz 2006), philanthropic initiatives are increasingly “demanding short-term, measurable
deliverables contracted up-front with grantees, and holding grantees strictly accountable for
what they do and do not do (Porter and Kramer (1999); Rimel (1999)). At the “venture”
end of the new philanthropy, the entrepreneurial techniques of venture capital are being applied (Letts, Ryan, and Grossman (1997)). Donees are analogized to start-up firms, donors
partner with them, establishing specific and measurable benchmarks, and continuing their
investments only if periodic goals are met” (page 1311). Sellaband artist-entrepreneurs compete for investors. They pitch their projects and enter into contracts that commit them
to sharing their revenue with investors. In summary, even individuals who commit funds
to projects for non-pecuniary reasons are likely to be sensitive to the types of costs that
traditionally favor financial transactions between co-located individuals. As such, we refer
to individuals who participate in crowdfunding as investors throughout the paper, keeping
6

in mind that they may not be motivated by purely pecuniary returns on their investment.

2.2

Data

Our data contain every investment made on Sellaband from its launch in August 2006 until
September 2009. Over this period, there were 4,712 artist-entrepreneurs on Sellaband who
received at least one $10 investment. Of these, 34 raised the $50,000 required to access
their capital to finance the making of their album. The distribution of investments in these
entrepreneurs is highly skewed: these 34 raised 73% of the $2,322,750 invested on the website.
To explore the role of geography in the crowdfunding of early-stage entrepreneurial
projects, we used geographic information disclosed by entrepreneurs and investors on Sellaband. For entrepreneurs, location was cross-checked with their official website, MySpace,
and Facebook profiles. We used the Google Maps APIs6 to retrieve latitude and longitude
for each location7 and to standardize city names. We then manually checked locations and
in the case of multiple or ambiguous matches either cleaned further or coded as missing. Finally, we calculated geodesic distances between entrepreneurs and investors using a method
developed by Thaddeus Vincenty and implemented by Austin Nichols (Nichols 2003). In our
focal sample, we have distance measures for 90% of entrepreneur-investor pairs.
The other data we use in our main specifications is the cumulative investment raised by
the entrepreneur from all investors as of the previous week. In some specifications, we also
use song and video uploads that entrepreneurs post on the website and investor proximity
to concert locations (and the dates of those concerts).
We focus our analysis on investments in the 34 entrepreneurs who raised $50,000, examining the timing of investment and types of investors. We focus on these 34 for several
reasons. First, they are more comparable with each other in terms of their performance on
6

According to the data available, we used country, region, city name, and zipcode or country-region-city
triads or country-city pairs.

the site because they have each successfully gone through the full funding cycle. Second,
we eliminate concerns about right truncation of the data by focusing on entrepreneurs who
complete the funding cycle. Third, we have geographic location information for the vast
majority of the investors in these 34 entrepreneurs because investors must give their location
in order to receive their CD. Fourth, focusing on these 34 eliminates musicians who use
Sellaband sporadically and do not treat the platform as a place for entrepreneurial activity.
Finally, since these 34 entrepreneurs account for nearly three-quarters of all funds raised on
Sellaband, we argue that little information is lost by focusing on them (and our robustness
checks to other samples confirm this).
The main sample is therefore constructed by taking the 34 entrepreneurs who reach
$50,000 during our observation period. Entrepreneurs enter the sample when they receive
their first investment and exit when they reach the target. The resulting panel is unbalanced.
We identify every investor who invested at least once in one of these 34 entrepreneurs.
Investors enter the sample when they make their first investment on Sellaband (in any
entrepreneur) because their profile becomes visible to entrepreneurs and other investors at
that time. Investors never exit the sample.
Our main ($50K) sample of entrepreneur-investor pairs is the Cartesian product of the 34
successful entrepreneurs and all investors who invest at least once in one of them. Each pair
appears during each week in which both the entrepreneur and the investor are in the sample.8
Because we use entrepreneur-investor pair fixed effects in our regression analysis, pairs with
no investments are dropped. There are 18,827 entrepreneur-investor pairs with at least one
investment from the investor in the entrepreneur and 709,471 entrepreneur-investor-week
observations.
8

For example, if Entrepreneur 1 receives her first investment in week 10 and reaches $50K in week 20,
then she will appear in the sample from weeks 10 through 20. If Investor 2 made his first investment in week
5, then he is paired with Entrepreneur 1 for weeks 10 through 20. If Investor 3 made his first investment in
Week 18, then he is paired with Entrepreneur 1 for weeks 18 through 20.

8

We present descriptive statistics for the $50K sample in Table 1a. Of these successful
entrepreneurs, the average takes approximately one year (53 weeks) to reach $50,000, although there is considerable variation around the mean from just under two months to more
than two years. The source of financing is widely distributed; on average entrepreneurs
raise their financing from 609 different investors. Across the 34 $50K-entrepreneurs, there
are 8,149 unique investors. On average, these investors invest in 2.5 $50K-entrepreneurs,
making 4.3 distinct investments (i.e., they often invest on more than one occasion in a single
entrepreneur). They invest a total of $208 across all $50K-entrepreneurs during the period
under study. In other words, investors invest $82 per entrepreneur, on average (see Figure 2
for a detailed frequency distribution of investment instance magnitudes). In terms of artistic effort, these entrepreneurs post 4.3 demo songs on their profile during the fundraising
process, above and beyond the songs they post when they first launch their profile.9
In the full sample of entrepreneurs (Table 1b), the average entrepreneur only has 11.4
investors. Overall, investors spend an average of $150 on Sellaband, spread over 3.5 entrepreneurs and 5.5 different investment occasions.

2.3

Geographic variance on Sellaband

Figure 3a presents the geographic distribution of the 34 entrepreneurs who raise $50K. They
are distributed over five continents with the majority in Europe and the United States.
Figure 3b illustrates the geographic distribution of investors in these entrepreneurs. They
represent 80 countries and are also particularly concentrated in Europe and the eastern
United States.
Table 2 illustrates the quantity of investment by distance. Table 2a splits distance into
9

Many entrepreneurs launch their profile with three songs - the maximum number the system accommodates. It is likely that all of these $50K-entrepreneurs launched their profile with three songs, meaning the
average number of songs per entrepreneur is 7.3 (3+4.3). We only have data on songs added, not the number
of songs posted at the time of launching a new profile.

9

five groups. The average investment level within 50 km is significantly higher than the
investment level over 50 km, conditional on investing. In order to simplify the analysis, we
group all entrepreneur-investor pairs within 50 km as “local” and all others as “distant.”
The idea is that “being local” involves an easy commute by car or public transit. Our
results are robust to other thresholds. Table 2b shows that although local investments are
on average higher than distant, $196 compared to $74, there are many more distant investors
and therefore in aggregate they account for the vast majority of total investments. In other
words, conditional on making an investment, local investors invest on average 2.6 times that
of distant investors.
Local investors are also more likely to invest in a particular entrepreneur. Conditional
on making at least one investment in any entrepreneur on Sellaband, 11.4% of individuals
who are local to an entrepreneur invest. In contrast, only 1.5% of distant investors who are
distant to an entrepreneur invest. In this way, investors are disproportionately local.

3

Empirical Strategy

Our econometric analysis is a straightforward framework at the entrepreneur-investor-week
level. Investor i will invest in entrepreneur e in week t if the expected value from investment
is positive:
veit = βCumulativeInvet−1 + γXeit + µei + ψt + eit
where veit is the value of investing in entrepreneur e at time t by investor i. The value
from investment includes both the monetary expected return of investment as well as any
consumption utility derived from investing in that entrepreneur. β is the perceived marginal
value of cumulative investment as of the previous week. For example, a higher cumulative
investment may indicate that more investors perceive the entrepreneur to be of high quality
and therefore a better investment. Alternatively, investors may derive more consumption
10

utility from investing in entrepreneurs who are closer to the $50K threshold. In our main
specification, CumulativeInvet−1 is included as a vector of dummy variables defined by the
$10000 cumulative investment thresholds. In addition, γ is the perceived marginal value of
the controls (Xeit ) including a control for time since the entrepreneur began on Sellaband,
µei is an entrepreneur-investor fixed effect to control for overall tastes of the investor, ψt is
a week fixed effect to control for changes in the Sellaband environment over time, and eit is
an idiosyncratic error term.
Because veit is a latent variable, we instead examine the decision to invest. Therefore,
to understand the value to the investor in investing in entrepreneur e at time t we use the
following discrete choice specification:

1(Investeit ) = βCumulativeInvet−1 + γXeit + µei + ψt + eit

Consistent with the suggestions of Angrist and Pischke (2009), we estimate this using a
linear probability model although we show robustness to alternative specifications. Likely
because our covariates are binary, the vast majority of the predicted probabilities of our
estimates lie between zero and one. Therefore the potential bias of the linear probability
model is reduced in our estimation (Horrace and Oaxaca 2006). The fixed effects mean
that our analysis examines the timing of investment for entrepreneur-investor pairs where
we observe at least one investment. The fixed effects completely capture the entrepreneurinvestor pairs in which we never see investment, and these pairs can therefore be removed
from the analysis without any empirical consequences. Standard errors are clustered at the
entrepreneur-investor pair level. Cumulative investment is measured at the entrepreneurweek level. Because the average entrepreneur in our main sample has over 600 investors, the

11

cumulative investment number is not driven by any individual investor.10
In order to understand the role of distance, we separately estimate local and distant
entrepreneur-investor pairs.11

l
1(Investeit ) = β l CumulativeInvet−1 + γXeit
+ µlei + ψtl + leit
d
1(Investeit ) = β d CumulativeInvet−1 + γXeit
+ µdei + ψtd + deit

if local
if distant

Furthermore, in order to understand the role of F&F, we interact F&F with cumulative
investment in each of these separately estimated local and distant equations.

l
1(Investeit ) = β l CumulativeInvet−1 +θl F &Fei ×CumulativeInvet−1 +γXeit
+µlei +ψtl +leit if local

d
1(Investeit ) = β d CumulativeInvet−1 +θd F &Fei ×CumulativeInvet−1 +γXeit
+µdei +ψtd +deit if distant

The main effect of F&F will drop out due to collinearity with the entrepreneur-investor fixed
effects. With this empirical approach we examine when an investor chooses to invest in
a particular entrepreneur, conditional on at least one investment by that investor in that
entrepreneur. Investors often invest more than once in the same entrepreneur during a single $50,000 round of fundraising. We assume that the timing of investment is driven by
the change in cumulative investment rather than by another change that is specific to the
entrepreneur-investor pair. We also assume that the entrepreneur-investor and week fixed
10

We address the potential for bias due to the use of fixed effects when several investors invest just once by
showing robustness to random effects and to limiting the sample to investors who invest in the entrepreneur
at least twice.
11
We estimate separately for clarity of presentation. All results are robust to using interaction terms in
simultaneous estimation of local and distance.

12

effects as well as other covariates control for omitted variables. Our main results hold as
long as there is not an omitted variable that drives lagged cumulative investment, an increase in the value of distant investing, and a simultaneous decrease in the value of local
investing. One plausible variable that might fit such a description is concert touring. As an
entrepreneur gains visibility, they may be more able to tour to more distant locations. We
therefore show that our results are robust to controls for touring.

Results

We build our results in three steps. First, we document that investors’ propensity to invest in
a given week increases as the entrepreneur visibly accumulates capital on the site. Second, we
show that local investors do not follow this pattern. Instead they are most likely to invest
early in the cycle, before an entrepreneur has raised $10,000. Finally, we show that this
difference between local and distant investors is entirely explained by the group of investors
we label Friends and Family (F&F). The results are robust to numerous specifications, some
of which appear in the paper and some in the appendix.12

4.1

Investment propensity increases with funds raised

In Table 3 we show that investment propensity increases as an entrepreneur accumulates
investment. Column (1) reports the main results using the $50K sample. The use of the
$50K sample ensures this is not a simple selection story where only the better entrepreneurs
appear in the sample with higher cumulative investment. Relative to an entrepreneur with
less than $10,000 in investment, a given investor is 2.1 percentage points more likely to invest
12
In the main tables we focus on a core specification and a handful of key robustness checks. In the
appendix we verify that our results are robust to numerous alternative specifications of the sample chosen,
covariates used, and functional forms.

13

in a given week if the entrepreneur has $10,000-$20,000 and 8.4 percentage points more likely
to invest if they have more than $40,000. These increases are large relative to a weekly base
rate of 4.1% during the first $10,000. We illustrate the estimates of the increase in propensity
to invest in a given week over different capital levels in Figure 4. Because we use a linear
probability model, this means we can simply plot the coefficient values.
Column (2) shows that the qualitative result is robust to using the full sample of all
entrepreneurs. Column (3) shows robustness to a fixed-effects linear regression using quantity invested as the dependent variable rather than a dummy for whether an investment
occurred. Column (4) shows robustness to including controls for artistic effort including
posting videos and songs to the website and giving live performances in the investor’s locale.
Videos and concerts are positively related to investments but their inclusion does not affect
the relationship between cumulative investment and propensity to invest.13
Overall, Table 3 shows that investment accelerates as an entrepreneur gets closer to
$50,000. This is consistent with Zhang and Liu (2010) who document a similar pattern on
Prosper.com. Like Zhang and Liu (2010), we argue that this is suggestive evidence of path
dependency: past investment may increase the propensity to invest. It is only suggestive
13
For this table, as well as tables 4 and 6, we show robustness to several more specifications in the appendix.
Table A1 repeats the main results of the paper to facilitate comparison. In terms of the sample, we show
robustness to the full sample (Table A2), the sample of entrepreneurs who reach $1000 in investments (Table
A3), the sample of entrepreneurs who reach $5,000 in investments (Table A4), the sample constructed by
dropping entrepreneurs from the Netherlands (the home country of the website) (Table A5), the sample
constructed by dropping entrepreneurs from the music hubs of New York City, Los Angeles, Nashville,
London, and Paris (Tables A6 and A7), to including only investors who invest two or more times (Table
A8), and to using as unit of analysis the entrepreneur-investor-month (Table A9). In terms of covariates,
we show robustness to defining cumulative investment as appearing on the Sellaband “charts” as one of
the 25 artist-entrepreneurs closest to raising $50,000 (Table A10), to including just video and song uploads
(Table A11), to including just whether the entrepreneur performed in the investor’s locale (Table A12), to
including videos, songs, and performances (Table A13), to removing focal investor’s past investment from
the entrepreneur’s accumulated capital (Table A14), and to including whether the entrepreneur appeared in
the Sellaband Newsletter (Table A15). In terms of the functional form, we show robustness to fixed-effects
logit (Table A16), fixed-effects poisson regression on the total parts invested (Table A17), linear regression
on the total parts invested and (when applicable) disinvested (Table A18), to random effects (Table A19).
The appendix also shows robustness of Tables 4 and 6 to alternative measures of “local” (Tables A20 and
A21), treating missing geographic information as distant (Table A22), combining distant and local in the
same regression and using interactions (Table A23), to alternative definitions of F&F (Table A24).

because, in the absence of a truly exogenous shock to investment, we cannot reject the
possibility that some other activity may cause the acceleration in investment. Nevertheless,
to the extent that the fixed effects and the covariates on entrepreneurial effort control such
activities, the underlying pattern in the data, combined with the prominent placement of
cumulative investment information on the website, suggest that high levels of cumulative
investment may cause an increase in the rate at which new investment arrives.

4.2

Local and distant investors are different

In Table 4 we stratify the data between local and distant investors. Local investors are
more likely to invest over the first $20,000 than later. In contrast, the results for distant
investors resemble the overall results shown in Table 3. Columns (1) and (2) show our main
specification. In Figure 5 we provide a graphical representation of the propensity to invest at
different stages in the investment cycle. Local and distant investors clearly display distinct
patterns; distant investors’ propensity to invest rises as the entrepreneur accumulates capital,
whereas local investors’ propensity does not.
As mentioned above, our interpretation of these results holds as long as there is not
an omitted variable that drives lagged cumulative investment, an increase in the value of
distant investing, and a decrease in the value of local investing. In columns (3) and (4) we
address the possibility that entrepreneurs increase their effort to attract distant investors
as they become more successful. They might perform concerts further from home or they
might post more material on their website. Specifically, we show robustness to whether the
entrepreneur performs within 50 km of the investor and whether the entrepreneur posted a
new song or video to their website. The qualitative differences between local and distant
investment patterns remain.
In the appendix, we show that this general relationship is broadly robust to many other
specifications. The only notable difference in a few of the robustness checks is a flat relation15

ship between investment propensity and cumulative investment for local investors, rather
than a decreasing relationship. Still, the clear distinction between distant and local holds in
all cases: distant investors significantly increase their propensity to invest as the entrepreneur
accumulates capital whereas local investors do not.

4.3

Friends and Family

In this section we show that a particular type of investor, whom we label as “Friends and
Family” (F&F) of a particular entrepreneur, explains the observed difference between local
and distant investors. These individuals likely joined this market-making platform to fund
that particular entrepreneur. We define F&F by the following three characteristics:
1. The F&F investor invested in the focal entrepreneur before investing in any other (i.e.
the investor is likely to have joined the system for the focal entrepreneur)
2. The F&F investor’s investment in the focal entrepreneur is their largest investment
3. The investor invests in no more than three other entrepreneurs (i.e. the focal entrepreneur remains a key reason for being on the site)
To confirm the validity of our measure, we received information from seven successful
entrepreneurs on Sellaband on the investors they knew independently of Sellaband. Specifically, we asked them to identify from their list of investors all family members and friends
that they knew prior to joining Sellaband. Our measure captured 76% of the investors that
these seven entrepreneurs identified, as well as a number of investors that the entrepreneurs
did not know personally. We later show that the difference between F&F and others holds
when we limit the sample to these seven entrepreneurs and their hand-coded list of F&F.
In Table 5 we provide descriptive statistics for the F&F sample. Using investor-level
measures of the use of the website’s communications tools (emails sent through the website
16

and comments on webpages), in Table 5a we show that they use Sellaband less intensively
than other investors. Specifically, they send approximately 34 times fewer emails, post 29
times fewer comments, receive five times fewer emails, and receive 16 times fewer comments
than non-F&F investors, on average. We conjecture that F&F might behave differently
on the Sellaband site because they interact with the entrepreneur through other channels.
Overall, these data suggest that F&F are a distinct group.
Furthermore, in Table 5b we show that F&F investors are disproportionately active at
the beginning of the investment process. On average, F&F account for approximately one
third of the focal entrepreneur’s total investment when they have raised their first $500 (or
similarly after the first four weeks). In contrast, they account for only one fifth by the end
of the fundraising cycle.
In Table 5c we show that although some F&F investors are distant, they are disproportionately local. In terms of number of investors, F&F account for 65% of investors under 25
km (61% between 25-50 km) but only 16% of distant investors. In terms of dollars, F&F account for 36% of investments under 25 km (60% between 25-50 km) but only 16% of distant
investment. Together, the statistics in these tables raise the possibility that the difference
between local and distant investors might be explained by F&F.
Next, we run our main specification on local and distant investors, but include an interaction of capital levels with an indicator for F&F (Table 6). The results show that local and
distant investors are qualitatively similar, conditional on F&F. Particularly, in all specifications, for both local and distant investors, F&F tend to invest early in the funding cycle and
non-F&F tend to invest later. We illustrate this result in Figure 6 which shows that nonF&F investors, both local and distant, increase their propensity to invest as the entrepreneur
accumulates capital whereas F&F investors do not.
A potential concern with our interpretation of these results is that our definition only
proxies for Friends and Family. It is likely that we include many investors who are not really
17

F&F, and that we exclude some investors that are F&F. In order to address this concern, we
examined investments in the seven entrepreneurs who identified their Friends and Family to
us. By focusing on just these seven entrepreneurs, we do not have enough local investments
to identify the coefficients of a local-only regression. Therefore, we combine local and distant
investors and re-run the F&F analysis using all investors in these seven entrepreneurs and the
F&F that they identified. We present the results in Table 7: even with the limited sample,
for the F&F group we see that investment propensity decreases as cumulative investment
approaches $50,000. Table 7 shows that the results of Table 6 are robust to this more direct
definition of F&F. We interpret this result as providing validity for our main definition of
F&F.
In summary, our results suggest that there is no systematic difference between local and
distant investors, except to the extent that social networks (as measured by F&F) are disproportionately local.

4.4

Is this just buying music?

One potential alternative interpretation of the difference between F&F and others is that
other investors are not investing in the entrepreneur, instead they are simply buying the
music in advance. As mentioned above, when investors own shares in an entrepreneur that
raises $50K, the investor receives a CD. If an investor is really just buying music, it may
make sense to wait until the financing is almost complete, and therefore such an investor
may invest only when the entrepreneur is close to $50K. In Table 8, we show that the results
appear to be driven by more than just differences across groups in the value of the CD.
Column (1) shows that the results change very little if we focus only on those investors
who invested in the same artist on at least two occasions. This group would derive more
value from the first investment than the second since they receive the CD from their first
18

investment, but we still see the same patterns for F&F versus other investors.
Columns (2) and (3) exploit a policy change on the Sellaband website. Prior to December
2008, investors received a CD for every share that they purchased. Sellaband then changed
their policy and only provided a ‘free’ CD for the first share purchased. Column (2) shows
the overall difference between F&F and others before the policy change and column (3)
shows the difference after. The main results of the paper hold: F&F invest early and others
invest late, irrespective of whether a CD is given for each part purchased.
Table 8 therefore suggests that the results are unlikely to be driven by motives related
to purchasing music and instead appear to be driven by the expected pecuniary and nonpecuniary returns from investment. To reiterate, we cannot separately identify whether
investors are buying shares motivated by pecuniary returns or as a way to receive consumption utility through the potential to support and interact with an early-stage artist.

Conclusion

We examine the role of distance in an online platform for financing early stage artistentrepreneurs. We find that investment patterns over time are independent of geographic
distance between entrepreneur and investor after controlling for the entrepreneur’s offline
social network. This result contrasts with the existing literature that emphasizes the importance of spatial proximity in entrepreneurial finance. Instead, our result suggests that
online mechanisms can reduce economic frictions associated with investing in early-stage
projects over long distances. Only the spatial correlation of pre-existing social networks is
not resolved, and the online mechanisms do not yet eliminate frictions related to information
that is easily conveyed through a social network. This is consistent with prior research on
online activity that shows many, but not all, distance-related frictions are reduced in the
online setting (Blum and Goldfarb 2006, Hortacsu, Martinez-Jerez, and Douglas 2009).

19

Furthermore, our result emphasizes the important role that friends and family may play
online and offline in generating early investment in entrepreneurial ventures. Consistent
with Conti, Thursby, and Rothaermel (2010), we speculate that this early investment may
serve as a signal of entrepreneurial commitment. Later investors may use this signal thereby
increasing the likelihood of further funding by way of access to distant sources of capital.
Finally, we comment on the implications of crowdfunding in our particular industry
setting, recorded music. Over the past two decades, this industry has experienced significant
changes. Industry revenues have declined by approximately 50% over 10 years, which many
industry experts attribute to piracy through online file sharing (Passman 2009). At the
same time, costs associated with the production and distribution of music have also dropped
substantially due to the development of inexpensive production software and the digital
distribution of music over the internet. However, production costs are not zero and recording
artists are commonly cash constrained. In the vertically integrated industry set-up, large
record companies provided both financing and a full suite of services (e.g., producer, studio,
cover design, distribution, auxiliary musicians) in exchange for ownership of or equity in the
artists’ intellectual property. As the major labels decline in importance, artists have fewer
options to relieve cash constraints by borrowing against, or selling equity in, their intellectual
property. Crowdfunding helps overcome that constraint by creating a market for the most
salient asset available to aspiring new artists – their ideas, vision, and future intellectual
property – thereby facilitating financing from distant strangers. Thus, crowdfunding may
help reduce an important market failure.

Dependent variable is any investment in columns and sample is the $50K sample. In column
(1), only investors who invest at least two or more times are included. Column (2) includes
all investments that took place before the change in incentives (December 2008), while column
(3) those that happened after. In the before period, investors would receive one CD for
every 10$ invested in the entrepreneur. After the incentives change, only the first 10$ would
entitle the investor to receive a CD. All regressions include a full set of fixed effects for each
entrepreneur-investor pair (differenced out) and each week. Robust standard errors clustered
at the pair level in parentheses.

Dependent variable is total parts in columns (1)-(5) and sample is the $50K sample. Total
parts includes a small number of disinvestments where investors withdraw money from an
entrepreneur. Therefore, the analysis is done with OLS rather than fixed effects poisson. All
regressions include a full set of fixed effects for each entrepreneur-investor pair (differenced
out) and each week. Robust standard errors clustered at the pair level in parentheses. ***

Dependent variable is any investment in columns (1)-(10) and sample is the $50K sample. In columns (1)-(2), an investor is defined as F&F if she invested in that entrepreneur before investing in
any other. In columns (3)-(4), an investor is defined as F&F if she invested in that entrepreneur before investing in any other, her investment in the focal entrepreneur is her largest investment and
she invests in no other entrepreneurs. In columns (5)-(6), an investor is defined as F&F if she invested in that entrepreneur before investing in any other and she did not invest in more than three
other entrepreneurs. In columns (7)-(8), an investor is defined as F&F if she invested in that entrepreneur before investing in any other and her investment in the focal entrepreneur is her largest
investment. In columns (9)-(10), an investor is defined as F&F if her investment in the focal entrepreneur is her largest investment and she did not invests in more than three other entrepreneurs.
