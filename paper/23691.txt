ABSTRACT
This paper develops and tests a simple model to explain the origins of municipal segregation
ordinances. Passed by cities between 1909 and 1917, these ordinances prohibited members of the
majority racial group on a given city block from selling or renting property to members of
another racial group. Our results suggest that prior to these laws cities had created and sustained
residential segregation through private norms and vigilante activity. Only when these private
arrangements began to break down during the early 1900s did whites start lobbying municipal
governments for segregation ordinances.

1. Introduction
Residential segregation is among the most durable and salient features of American
urban life (Massey and Denton, 1993; Cutler et al. 1999). It is widely recognized that
governments at all levels have played at least some role in promoting and sustaining residential
segregation. At the federal level, for example, urban renewal projects, federally-financed
highway construction, and lending practices promulgated by New Deal agencies are often
invoked as explanatory factors in the rise of segregation (Boustan 2010; Fishback et al., 2013).
Similarly, at the local level, zoning laws and ordinances are often thought to have helped create
racial disparities in access to housing.1 In this paper, we ask: how and why did residential
segregation in American cities come to enjoy state sponsorship? Much like Alston and Ferrie’s
(1993, 1999) analysis of paternalism and the rise of the American welfare state, we explore how
the demise of informal institutions can generate political demand for formal state laws. In the
process, we formalize and test a simple framework that offers new insight into how political
and market processes interacted to shape the evolution of residential segregation in American
cities.
At first glance, explaining how and why residential segregation came to be state
sponsored seems both simple and obvious: white voters preferred to live in all white
neighborhoods, and sought legislation to forestall black in-migration. There are, however, at
least two problems with this simple, preference-based answer. First, to the extent that anti-

2

black sentiments were widespread and generally held among white voters, an exclusivelypreference-based answer suggests that laws promoting residential segregation would have been
ubiquitous. Yet, the available historical evidence suggests that demand for formal segregation
laws varied over time and across space. As explained below, the first laws governing the
locational choices of urban-dwelling African Americans did not appear until around 1910, and
even then, those laws were limited to a handful of cities in the South and various border states.
Second, any answer to the question “why do we have laws promoting residential segregation”
that relies solely on white preferences ignores the underlying economic processes that shaped
demand for such laws. For example, standard neighborhood tipping models suggest that the
threat of sharp reductions in real estate values, not just preferences per se, would have been an
important driver in the demand for municipal segregation laws and other formal measures
restricting black mobility within cities.
To understand how and why residential segregation came to enjoy formal state support,
we explore the passage of municipal segregation ordinances. First passed by local governments
during the early 1900s, segregation ordinances prohibited blacks from occupying residences on
the streets and blocks where whites occupied most residences. Although these ordinances were
in operation for less than a decade before the Supreme Court struck them down as
unconstitutional, they ushered in a host of formal laws, regulations, and government agencies
thought to have promoted and sustained residential segregation over the past century. Before
segregation ordinances, white property owners relied exclusively on private forms of collective
action, often in the form of threats and private vigilante activity, to deter blacks from migrating
3

into previously all-white neighborhoods. Only after the passage of segregation ordinances did
whites begin supplementing their private efforts with state action. In this way, one might think
of segregation ordinances as a watershed event that marked the transition toward a more statist
and formal approach of promoting and sustaining residential segregation.
We organize our analysis around a political economy framework that integrates the
logic of collective action (Olson 1969) with a simple tipping framework (e.g., Card et al. 2008)
Although segregation is always an equilibrium outcome in our framework, the model suggests
demand for segregation laws could have arisen through two possible channels. The first
channel relates to increased demand for housing in black neighborhoods. In particular, because
the black housing stock was relatively limited, as black urban populations during the early 20th
century expanded, black households had to pay a premium over whites for the same housing
stream. This difference created incentives for blacks to violate the informal norms that dictated
where black families could, and could not, reside. The second channel focuses on the ability of
whites to organize and carry out private vigilante activity designed to discourage blacks from
violating the informal norms governing neighborhood choice. To the extent that the ability of
whites to impose costs on defectors declined over time, one expects demand for state-sponsored
segregation laws to have risen. This logic suggests that cities with the lowest ability to provide
segregation through private vigilante activity would have been the first places to pass
segregation laws.
After developing this model, we turn to our empirical analysis. The goal of the analysis
is to identify which of the two channels (i.e., increases in black housing demand and/or
4

reductions in white vigilante activity) actually drove demand for passage of municipal
segregation ordinances. Although our data and estimating strategies are limited, the patterns
we observe are consistent with the predictions of the model, though the evidence for the
vigilante channel is stronger than for the housing demand channel. In particular, whether we
use city-level or ward-level data, we find only mixed evidence that demand for segregation
ordinances is strongest in areas with the fastest growing black populations.
By contrast, we find relatively strong and robust evidence for the second channel
involving white vigilante activity. Across a variety of model specifications and different
measures of white vigilante activity, it is clear that in the cities where whites were able to police
color lines and punish deviations through private channels, there was relatively little demand
for segregation ordinances. For example, the data show that in cities located in counties with
high lynching rates (a direct indicator of the ability of whites to organize privately to punish
blacks for violating established racial norms) the probability of passing a segregation ordinance
is significantly lower than in places with low lynching rates. Similarly, cities that possessed a
robust volunteer fire department (an alternative measure of the ability to provide public goods
through private channels) are significant less likely to pass a segregation ordinance. We
supplement our city-level analysis with ward level data from St. Louis. With the ward-level
data from St. Louis, we can identity which wards were the strongest supporters of the city’s
segregation ordinance. The patterns observed in St. Louis suggest that support for the city’s
segregation ordinance was strongest in the wards where it was difficult for white communities
to coordinate private vigilante activity.
5

The findings reported here are significant on three dimensions. First, economists
typically invoke one of the following three mechanisms to explain the origins and persistence of
residential segregation: market-based processes (e.g., neighborhood tipping and white flight);
privately-coordinated collective action (e.g., vigilante activity and steering by real estate agents);
and publically-coordinated collective action through formal legal instruments (e.g., segregation
ordinances, redlining, discriminatory lending rules promulgated by government agencies).
While there is much evidence, econometric and otherwise, to suggest all of these institutions
and processes matter to some degree, there is no unifying model that predicts how they interact,
how one mechanism might come to supplant another, or how and why their incidence and
effectiveness might vary over time and across space. Integrating the logic of collective action
with a simple model of white flight, this paper provides such a framework, and provides
systematic testing of its central predictions.
Second, prevailing historical accounts suggest that segregation ordinances were passed
in the immediate aftermath of black families moving into previously all-white neighborhoods,
and more generally, in response to growing demand for housing among a small group of
upwardly-mobile urban dwelling blacks (e.g., Rice 1968; Meyer 2001, p. 21). While such
secondary accounts are consistent with our model, they have not been formalized or tested
empirically. In this way, the existing historical literature treats it as an article of faith that
segregation ordinances were first passed in the cities with the largest and fastest growing black
populations. The empirical results below, however, provide only modest support for this claim.
Furthermore, the existing secondary literature on the early history of segregation largely
6

ignores how changes in the ability of whites to coordinate their vigilante activity through
private channels helped shape both the demand for segregation ordinances and the frequency
with which black families violated established neighborhood color lines. Our evidence suggests
understanding the efficacy of white vigilante activity is key to explaining the origins of statesponsored laws and policies governing residential segregation.
Third, Alston and Ferrie (1993, 1999) and Alston and Higgs (1985) show how informal
institutions such as paternalism and share-cropping shaped economic and political outcomes in
the American South during the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. One of the most
interesting contributions of the Alston and Ferrie work is to show how the viability of an
informal institution (i.e., paternalism) hindered the development of a formal welfare state. In
the same spirit, we show how private vigilante activity undercut demand for formal laws
segregating housing markets in cities in border states and the South. In the context of a stylized
tipping model, we show how threats to an established segregated equilibrium drive demand for
formal segregation laws. Consistent with the model, we find evidence that the cities most likely
to pass segregation ordinances were characterized by two features: first, they had rapidly
growing white populations, which undermined the ability of white neighborhoods to organize
and punish defectors through private mechanisms; and second they exhibited relatively low
rates of lynching, which is consistent with the hypothesis that segregation ordinances were a
publicly-provided substitute for private vigilante activity.

2. The Rise and Fall of Municipal Segregation Ordinances: A Brief Overview
In 1910, Baltimore passed the first municipal segregation ordinance in American history.
The ordinance forbade any white person from moving into or using as a residence a house or
apartment on a city block where the majority of residences were occupied by “colored persons;”
and by the same token, it prohibited African Americans from doing the same. As a result, no
African American could move into, or occupy residences on city blocks where most residences
were occupied by whites.2 Within eight years, 23 other cities in the American South, and
various border states, followed suit. Table 1 lists the 24 cities that passed one or more
segregation ordinances between 1910 and 1917.3 Only one of these cities is outside the South:
Colwyn, a small town in Southeastern, Pennsylvania. Six of the cities were located in Virginia,
and three were in North Carolina. These ordinances typically included fines that ranged from
50 to 200 dollars, and confinement in city jails from thirty to ninety days.4

2

On the passage of the Baltimore segregation ordinance, see Philadelphia Inquirer, Dec. 20, 1910, p. 2; Rice
(1968); Stephenson (1914); Power (1983); and Higginbotham (1990).
3

To identify all cities passing segregation ordinances, we first searched the Lexis-Nexis database for court
cases and laws involving segregation ordinances and other local laws regulating the locational choices of
African Americans. We then consulted the Historical Newspapers database at the University of Pittsburgh
and the newspaper database at the Library of Congress (search terms included “municipal”,
“segregation”, “ordinance,” “law”, “residence”, “negro”, and “neighborhood”). At the Library of
Congress, we also surveyed every issue of The Crisis for discussions of segregation ordinances. The Crisis
was the primary outlet for the NAACP during the early twentieth century.
4

For descriptions of various ordinances, see the following sources. Hopkins v. Richmond, and Coleman v.

Ashland 117 Va. 692 (1915) describes ordinances in Richmond and Ashland, Virginia. The Philadelphia
Inquirer, Jan. 24, 1915, p. 4, describes the ordinance in Colwyn, Pennsylvania. State of Maryland v. John H.
Gurry 121 Md. 534 (1913) describes the Baltimore ordinance. Harris v. City of Louisville, Buchanan v. Warley
165 Ky. 559 (1915) describes the Louisville ordinance. The Charlotte Observer, Sept. 27, 1913, p. 4,
describes segregation ordinances in Anderson, South Carolina; Baltimore, Maryland; Greenville, South

8

From their inception, segregation ordinances were surrounded by debates about their
constitutionality. State courts in Maryland and North Carolina struck down segregation
ordinances for infringing on the vested property rights of blacks in particular and property
owners in general, while state courts in Virginia and Kentucky upheld segregation ordinances
as a legitimate exercise of local police powers. In Georgia, the state’s highest court struck down
Atlanta’s first segregation ordinance, but upheld a later ordinance re-shaped in light of the
court’s earlier ruling. The uncertain constitutional status of segregation ordinances was only
resolved in 1917, when the United States Supreme Court struck down a Louisville ordinance in
its landmark decision, Buchanan v. Warley. Quoting liberally from other opinions, the Court
explained that residential segregation ordinances were different from laws segregating railroad
cars and schools. In the latter instances, “the complaining person was afforded the opportunity
to ride, or to attend institutions of learning, or afforded the thing of whatever nature . . . he was
entitled. The most that was done was to require him as a member of a class to conform with
reasonable rules in regard to the separation of the races.” By contrast, “the effect” of
segregation ordinances “was not merely to regulate a business or the like, but was to destroy
the right of the individual to acquire, enjoy, and dispose of his property (Buchanan v. Warley 245
U.S. 60 1917, p. 81).”

Carolina; and Atlanta, Georgia. The Columbia State, Feb. 3, 1915, p. 3, describe a segregation ordinance in
Spartanburg, South Carolina.

9

Following the Supreme Court’s decision in Buchanan v. Warley, cities eventually stopped
passing segregation ordinances. The significance of the Court’s decision is shown in figure 1,
which plots the (cumulative) number of cities in the United States to have ever passed a
segregation ordinance over time. Starting in 1910, there is steep upward trend in the number of
cities having ever passed an ordinance.5 If that trend had continued on its pre-Buchanan pace, a
linear projection suggests that nearly seventy cities would have passed segregation ordinances
by 1930. But as it was, after the Court’s decision in 1917, only seven cities passed such laws and
those were all declared unconstitutional in light of Buchanan v. Warley.
3. Two Questions
Given the pervasiveness of white racism over time and across space, this brief historical
overview raises to two related questions: first, why did not more cities pass segregation
ordinances, and second, why did cities wait until around 1910 to begin passing such laws? The
dearth of such ordinances seems even more surprising when one puts them in historical
context, noting that there were laws segregating virtually every other aspect of the social life of
African Americans in cities and states including parks, hotels, schools, public auditoriums,
libraries, hospitals, street cars, railroads, and many other areas of activity.6 The existing

5

One might view segregation ordinances (and Jim Crow more generally) as an example of the tyranny of
the majority. Buchanan v. Warley, in turn, might be seen as an example of how an independent judiciary
can effectively check the tyrannical impulses of a racist white majority. See, more generally, Fleck and
Hanssen (2012).
6

See Margo (1990) and Pritchett (1989) on schools. Roback (1986) discusses segregation on street cars.
The Civil Rights Cases 109 U.S. (1882) is a landmark court case describing private actions segregating
hotels and public auditoriums. Klarman (1998) analyzes railroad segregation and judicial treatment of

10

historical literature answer these two questions by appealing to shifts in black demand: in times
and places, where there was limited demand for black housing in urban areas, there was no
need for segregation ordinances and none were passed. It was only when black populations in
urban areas began to grow that black families began moving into previously all-white
neighborhoods.7
While the emphasis on black housing demand is plausible and intuitively appealing, we
argue that this focus misses a key part of the story: the breakdown of a privately-provided and
sustained apartheid. Understanding this dimension of the story addresses a fundamental
question: why were African Americans migrating into white neighborhoods at an increasing
rate in the first place? More precisely, white homeowners could create and sustain racially
segregated neighborhoods through private organizations or the state, and for most of the

segregation laws more generally. Stephenson (1911) provides an encyclopedic review of segregation and
race-separation laws in the American South before 1910. Kirsch (2007) and McKay (1954) look at the
history of segregation of public golf courses and other forms of recreation. Cresswell (1996) and Wolters
(2002) focus on libraries. Doyle (1990) and Connerly (2013) explore various types of segregation laws in a
series of Southern cities. The canonical treatment of Jim Crow remains Woodward (1955).
7

Writing in the Journal of Southern History, Rice (1968) argues: “[African-American] sections were
traditionally located in the older, run-down parts of a town. Since the migration increased at a faster rate
than the [housing stock in the black area] expanded, crowding became a severe problem. In addition . . .
more prosperous [blacks] sought relief from the crowded conditions of the [black] section by moving
outside . . . traditional boundaries.” Similarly, describing conditions in Baltimore, Meyer (2001, p. 21)
writes: “It is not hard to explain the city council’s willingness to enact a segregation ordinance. The
growth of the black community and the economic progress of a small segment of the [black population]
had rendered ineffective the customary restrictions on African American advancement. . . . The unrest
caused by the movement of middle-class blacks into white districts forced the city take some action to
restore stability.” Meyer (2001, pp. 18-27) also suggests that the experience of Baltimore is representative
of broader historical patterns.

11

nineteenth century, segregation was maintained through private arrangements such as
neighborhood associations and private vigilante activity. Only when it became costly to sustain
these private arrangements during the early 1900s did whites turn to municipal governments
for assistance. In support of this line of thought, we start out by reviewing the relevant
historical evidence. We then formalize these ideas in a model, and subject them to formal
hypothesis tests later in the paper.
Newspaper accounts suggest that before 1910, whites in Southern cities did not demand
segregation ordinances because segregation was maintained through informal norms and
private, extra-legal means. For example, the Macon Daily Telegraph wrote that: “ A social color
line [is] imperative . . . in the matter of residence. The black man may have as fine a house as
his money can buy . . . but his house must stand in a neighborhood occupied by his own race.
This is the South’s unenacted but irrevocable law.” According to the paper, this “unwritten law
of segregation” was in most places a “sufficient check” on any black migration into all-white
neighborhoods. Highlighting the punishment that would be visited upon black families and
real estate agents who dared violate this “unwritten law,” the Daily Telegraph discussed the
stability of residential segregation in Charleston, South Carolina:
Social and business ostracism would be the portion of any real estate dealer in
this typical old Southern city if he were to aid the negro [sic] to invade the
residential sections occupied by whites, but the fact that the negro [sic] ‘knows
his place,’ and realizes the wisdom of living in harmony with the white man,
whose superiority he recognizes, makes it practically impossible that the issue
[i.e., black migration into all white neighborhoods] should ever arise here.

12

The paper documented similar patterns for other Southern cities (Macon Daily Telegraph, Oct.
27, 1910, p. 4).
Sometime around 1910, however, the privately-sustained equilibrium described by the
Daily Telegraph began to break down. And as a result, when blacks began moving into
previously all white neighborhood, their movement was unaffected by the pleas and threats
made by white organizations. For example, in 1907 in St. Louis, Missouri, three black families
moved into homes on Finney Street in the city’s West End. These families were promptly
visited by members of the West End Protective Association, who “politely” explained to them
why their new neighbors preferred that they sell their homes, or break their leases, and move
elsewhere. At one point the spokesman for the association, a Catholic Priest named Father
McDonald, asked a newly arrived black resident why he was refusing to entertain the
association’s “polite” requests that he move. The resident, L.T. Traddock, who worked as a post
office clerk, replied: “I have never liked this house, and have been trying to ever since I moved
here in February to find another. But since my neighbors are so anxious to be rid of me I shan’t
overwork myself from now on in seeking another residence. In fact, I guess I’ll stay as long as
my landlord will permit me (St. Louis Post Dispatch, July 13, 1907, p. 3).”
Similarly, when Father McDonald explained to Bertha Williams, a school teacher, that
“from a Christian and moral point of view segregation was the best thing for both races,” she
could only ask: “will segregation be practiced in heaven?” When Father McDonald persisted,
explaining that if Williams were willing to rent her home he could find her a white family
willing to pay a handsome monthly fee, she “emphatically refused to consider the proposition.”
13

Williams did, however, make a counter-offer, telling the representatives of the Protective
Association that if they found a buyer for her home, she would consider offers that well
exceeded her original purchase price. “I am open to proposition[s] to sell the property,” she
said. “I paid $4,000 for it, and did not buy it on speculation. But if the control of it is so
valuable to my neighbors, I will sell at a substantial increase on my purchase price (St. Louis
Post Dispatch, July 13, 1907, p. 3).” What happened in St. Louis’s West End was not unusual: the
same story of blacks moving in and/or refusing to leave white neighborhoods even in the face of
veiled and explicit threats of violence began to occur throughout the city. It was only when
these private associations failed to sustain the equilibrium described by the Macon Daily
Telegraph above that whites in St. Louis began lobbying local politicians for a municipal
segregation ordinance.8
A few years after the West End Protective Association visited black families in St. Louis,
the same series of events played themselves out in Atlanta, Georgia. In the city’s fourth ward
whites organized a committee of prominent citizen’s to confront real estate agents and white
homeowners who were offering housing to black renters and buyers. These same groups also
visited black families bold enough to accept such offers (Atlanta Constitution, Oct. 9, 1915, p. 4).
Although these committees and associations typically characterized themselves as polite and
nonviolent, when they failed to deter black in-migration violence against the new black arrivals

See the following issues of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch: Feb. 16, 1916, p. 4; May 28, 1908, p. 7; Aug. 12,

often followed. For example, between 1917 and 1920, white vigilante groups in Chicago,
detonated more than 50 bombs in the homes of blacks and black real estate agents (Chicago
Commission on Race Relations, 1922, pp. 121-39), and at a smaller level in Dallas, the home of
William Connor was bombed after he moved into a “restricted” whites-only area (Lincoln Daily
News, Aug. 3, 1916, p. 1; see also, Martin 1934). Even in those cases where black in-migration
was not met with such extreme violence, the black “pioneer in a new white section [was]
generally subjected to a number of petty annoyances, such as broken windows, defaced
woodwork, mud on the steps, and unpleasant epithets (Macon Daily Telegraph, Jan. 1, 1911, p.
3).”
When veiled threats by neighborhood groups and vigilante activity proved ineffective,
whites turned to the political process. For example, in Atlanta’s fourth ward, the ward’s
alderman, Claude Ashley, introduced and eventually passed the city’s first segregation
ordinance in 1913.9 The same legislative patterns that were observed in Atlanta and St. Louis
were also seen in other cities passing segregation ordinances (Meyer 2001, pp. 18-27). It is ironic
that when associations of white homeowners lobbied for segregation ordinances they argued
that such legislation would promote the peaceful coexistence of the races and protect blacks

9

For the origins of the Atlanta segregation ordinance and the role played by Alderman Ashley, see the
following issues of the Atlanta Constitution: June 13, 1913, p. 5; June 16, 1913, p. 7; July 3, 1913, p. 12; and
Jan. 10, 1914, p. 1. After the Georgia Supreme Court struck down his first ordinance, Ashley immediately
began redrafting a second ordinance he hoped would pass judicial scrutiny. See Atlanta Constitution, Feb.
13, 1915, pp. 1 and 12. Bernstein (1990) quotes a passage from Booker T. Washington who argues that it
was not unorganized white voters who pushed for segregation ordinances, but white politicians who
whipped up voters and invented the problems that drove passage of segregation ordinances.

15

from violence and white vigilantism, despite the fact white homeowners where typically the
ones perpetuating the violence. The Northside Improvement Association in Miami, Florida
claimed that it “deplored” the violence that had driven several black families from their homes
on Avenue I between Fifth and Sixth Street. To prevent such violence, the association
advocated a municipal segregation ordinance that would clearly delineate white and black
neighborhoods and forestall racial provocations (Miami Herald, August 18, 1915, p. 8).
It is not surprising that the equilibrium described by the Daily Telegraph could break
down over time. Imagine a city where all segregation was privately provided and there were
no laws supporting private efforts to mandate residential segregation. Assume that through
some sort of private coordination, the city was cordoned off into two areas, one relatively small
area for blacks, and another larger area for whites. This informal arrangement would have been
vulnerable to shocks that increased demand for housing among blacks, or conversely, undercut
the ability of whites to organize and punish those who violated the established norms of
segregation. Along these lines, in describing the breakdown of informal segregation in
Baltimore, Maryland, the Macon Daily Telegraph (Oct. 27, 1910, p. 4) attributed that breakdown,
and the subsequent passage of the city’s first segregation ordinance, to the misplaced
“ambitions of prosperous [African]-Americans.”
As to the effects of demand shocks, suppose that black demand for housing rose either
in response to growing income among blacks or because the number of blacks living in the city
was growing over time. In either case, as blacks were forced to locate in the small area, housing
prices in that area would have risen relative to those in the white area. Eventually, housing
16

prices in the black area would have exceeded those in the white area, and blacks would have
paid more than whites for the same stream of housing. This, in turn, would have generated
incentives for both black home buyers and white home sellers to deviate from established
norms and begin making exchanges. Consistent with this line of thought, Cutler et al. (1999)
present data showing that in 1940 blacks in segregated cities were paying more housing than
were blacks in less segregated cities, and they hypothesize that these price differentials were the
product of collective action on the part of whites to exclude blacks from white neighborhoods.
Along the same lines, newspaper accounts suggest that price differential existed between black
and white housing, and that blacks had to pay more for identical housing streams.10
By the same token, one can also imagine increases in the size and/or heterogeneity of the
white population undermining the ability of whites to organize and punish those who deviated
from established norms. As the quotations above imply, in the absence of state intervention, the
threat of violence and retribution were essential to maintaining racially segregated
neighborhoods. But for the whites who desired to maintain residential segregation, the central
difficulty was that campaigns of violence and retribution were plagued by free rider problems.
The individuals perpetuating such acts risked arrest, prosecution, and personal injury. Given

10

See Columbia State, December 7, 1922. This newspaper account argues that as of the early 1920s,

housing prices in black and white neighborhoods were similar, but suggests that in the past there were
differences. Along the same lines, one German homeowner in St. Louis explained to his angry white
neighbors after selling his home to a black man: “We would rather sell to colored [sic] than to white folks
because we can get more from the colored [sic] folks (St. Louis Post Dispatch, Sept. 4, 1901, p. 2).”

17

this, they would have under-provided (from the perspective of the whites concerned with black
in-migration) violence and punishment against those who deviated from established practices.
One theme that repeats itself in the literature on the private-provision of public goods is
that private provision is most likely to survive and function effectively in a world where
communities are small and homogenous, while private provision is less likely to survive in
communities where there is rapid population growth and increasing heterogeneity (Ledyard
1995; Olson 1965). The upshot of these observations is that a privately-sustained equilibrium of
complete residential segregation would have been less likely to survive in settings where white
communities were experiencing rapid population growth that undermined the cohesiveness
and homogeneity of those communities.
Newspaper accounts from the era suggest that whites desired segregation not solely, or
even primarily, because of their own individual preferences, but because integration was
detrimental to property values. To this way of thinking, new black in-migration would cause
other whites to flee, driving down property values and culminating in an all-black
neighborhood where property values were significantly lower than in the original (pre-inmigration) equilibrium. As the St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Aug. 19, 1901, p. 1) explained: “The
[white] property owners will carry on the fight, not because they dislike Negroes but because
the advent of a Negro family will, they say, depreciate the value of their real estate. Newspaper
accounts from other cities also emphasized how (in their view) it was not racism that drove the
violence often directed toward newly arrived black families but the fact that “hard-working”
laborers and middle class families stood to lose their life savings because a few “ambitious”
18

blacks could not respect established color lines (Macon Daily Telegraph, Aug. 14, 1913, p. 4;
Gulfport Daily Herald, Dec. 23, 1910, p. 4).
4. The Political Economy of Segregation
In this section, we present a simple political economy framework to generate hypotheses
regarding the mechanisms that drove the political demand for segregation ordinances.
Rationalizing many of the observations in the preceding historical narrative, this framework
draws inspiration from two existing literatures in economics. The first is the literature
surrounding the logic of collective action as first developed by Olson (1969). The second is the
literature surrounding neighborhood tipping as formalized by Card et al. (2008). We begin with
a model of segregated housing markets. In this setup, integration is temporary, and in the
absence of formal legislation, segregation is maintained by private vigilante groups who punish
defectors for violating established color lines. As explained below, we assume that because
black housing supply is more inelastic than white housing supply and because blacks incur
punishment costs for entering the white market, blacks (in equilibrium) can pay a premium for
the same housing stream. However, when the financial premium African Americans pay for
housing exceeds the punishment costs inflicted by white vigilante groups, there are incentives
for blacks to enter the white market despite these costs. Black entry into the white market
causes whites near the point of entry to flee and leads to a one time expansion in the stock of
land and housing available to blacks, which in turn, results in a new segregated equilibrium.
Because there are costs to whites associated with moving from one segregated equilibrium to

19

another, threats to any initial equilibrium generate political support for formal legislation
mandating residential segregation.
More formally, consider a city with Nb (Nw) blacks (whites). Demand for housing is
perfectly inelastic; everyone consumes one unit of housing no matter the price. As a result,
market demand for both blacks and whites is simply the population of the respective group.
Whites only purchase housing in the white housing market; black home-buyers decide whether
to operate in the black or white market based on the relative prices of housing in both markets.
In terms of supply, sellers in both the black and white markets act as perfect competitors but
black housing supply is relatively inelastic. This structure suggests a setting where whites can
always move outward from the city center and build more housing on land in outlying areas,
while black families can only purchase housing on land already abandoned by whites. Because
whites do not face a land constraint, the supply of white housing (Sw) is perfectly elastic and
sold at a constant price, 𝑝̅ w. In contrast, because housing providers in the black market face a
land constraint (they can only operate in the areas whites are unwilling to occupy), the black
housing supply curve (Sb) is upward sloping in the short run.
If blacks violate the norms dictating where they can purchase housing, and move into
the white market, they incur some cost, C. This cost reflects the monetary value of the violence
and property damage imposed on defecting blacks by white vigilante groups. Private vigilante
activity promotes segregation by imposing a tax on any black family that might choose to
migrate into a previously all-white neighborhood. This violence tax drives a wedge between
housing prices in black and white communities, and creates a premium on the price blacks pay
20

in the exclusively black market. One might think of the private vigilante activity that whites use
to generate C as a public good for white homeowners. Given this, in settings where white
communities are (not) tightly knit and can (not) easily overcome the free-rider problems
associated with the private provision of local public goods (such as policing the racial make-up
of a given neighborhood), C would be relatively high (low).
In our setup, integration is temporary, and all equilibria are segregated. To maintain
any initial segregated equilibrium, the price of housing in the black-only market (pb) must be
weakly less than the effective price of housing for blacks in the all-white neighborhood. The
effective price for blacks in the all-white market includes both the financial price of the home
and the violence tax imposed by private vigilante groups so that for any segregated equilibrium
to survive it must the case that pb ≤ 𝑝̅ w + C. Violations of this inequality are temporary, inducing
both black migration into the white market and white flight near the point of black entry. As
whites abandon land and housing near the entry point, the short-run supply curve of black
housing shifts out, reducing price pressures in the black housing market and returning the
market to a new segregated equilibrium. As explained further below, this process generates a
saw-tooth pattern in the long-run black supply curve for black housing, with a series of teeth
rising from 𝑝̅ w to (𝑝̅ w + C).
Two types of shocks threaten any initial segregated equilibrium. First, because black
housing supply is relatively inelastic, as black housing demand increases, so too does the
premium blacks pay for housing in the exclusively black market. If black housing prices rise
sufficiently, the premium surpasses the costs blacks incur from private vigilante groups
21

working to preserve the racial integrity of the white housing market, and blacks enter the white
market despite C. Figure 2 shows how shocks to black housing demand can threaten any
existing equilibrium at ε0 by inducing white flight and movement to the new segregated
equilibrium at ε1. (In the figure, we suppress the b superscript.) As demand shifts from D0
toward D1, the price blacks pay for housing in the black market rises until the premium blacks
pay for housing temporarily exceeds C (or more precisely, pb > 𝑝̅ w + C) this induces some blacks
to enter the white market causing white flight and an outward shift in the short-run supply of
black housing. In particular, when white families flee the area where black families enter,
whites who abandon their residences make more land and housing available to blacks, and the
black housing supply curve shifts from S0 to S1. The new segregated equilibrium (ε1) is obtained
at the intersection of D1 and S1. Discrete breaks in the short run supply curve for housing
(identified by the vertical dotted lines) represent tipping points; at these points, blacks enter the
white market and induce white flight near the entry point.
The second channel through which any segregated equilibrium is threatened involves
reductions in the violence tax, C. Figure 3 illustrates. The initial equilibrium is at point ε0, with
a violence tax C0 and with N0 blacks paying P0 for housing. Assume there is some shock to the
ability of whites to organize and punish blacks through private channels, and the violence tax
falls from C0 to C1. This would reduce the effective price of housing that blacks pay for housing
in the white market, and in turn, induces some black families to enter the white market. Just as
above, this entry results in some whites abandoning land and housing, which in turn makes
more land and housing available for blacks and results in the black housing supply curve
22

shifting outward from S0 to S1. Because more land and housing are available to the black
population (N0) at the new equilibrium ε1, the equilibrium price falls from p0 to p1. Also, note
that with the reduction in violence costs from C0 to C1, tipping and flight now occur whenever pb
> 𝑝̅ w + C1 which is a lower threshold than 𝑝̅ w + C0.
Transitioning from one segregated equilibrium to another imposes movement costs (m)
on whites. We allow movement costs to vary across families for two reasons. First, while we
assume such actors are not politically relevant, the very first white family to sell to a black
family would gain from entry as that family would be able to sell their home at a price above
𝑝̅ w. Second, white homeowners located close to (far from) the black entry points where the most
(least) likely to have had to move. We therefore expect those whites located closest to points of
black incursion to have the largest movement costs (and the strongest demand for a formal law
prohibiting black in-migration into their neighborhoods), while white homeowners located far
from points of black entry would have no movement costs.11 In this setting, movement costs are
the proximate drivers of segregation laws, while increases in black housing demand and/or an
erosion in the ability of whites to provide private vigilante activity are the ultimate causes.
Figure 4 accomplishes two ends. First, it highlights the spatial assumptions we make in
our model; and second, it encapsulates our thinking on the role of proximity in driving the
political demand for segregation ordinances. Figure 4 depicts a circular city. The borders of the

11

In a world where land is scarce, it is possible that in those areas receiving new white homeowners (i.e.,
those fleeing), property values would rise and homeowners in those areas would actually benefit from
white flight. We abstract away from this possibility by assuming land and city boundaries can expand
infinitely.

23

city can expand indefinitely so that whites fleeing blacks can always find new housing and land
at constant price. In the initial equilibrium, with pw < pb < pw + C, blacks occupy the housing and
land in the smaller, gray circle labeled A. Suppose a shock to black housing demand or a
reduction in the violence tax drives up the price blacks pay for housing in area A relative to the
effective housing price in the rest of the city so that so that pb temporarily exceeds (𝑝̅ w + C). This
would induce some black families to enter the white housing market, causing whites in the
proximity of this entry, denoted by the circle B, to abandon their housing and relocate into some
other area of the city.
Whites in area B would be the most adversely affected by the breakdown in the initial
equilibrium, and would incur the largest movement costs. One expects whites in areas most at
risk for such black in-migration to have exhibited the strongest demand for segregation
ordinances. That said, because land is unconstrained for whites, white flight away from entry
points in area B causes the city boundaries and land supply to expand from C to D. As a result,
the whites who flee can always find land and housing on the outskirts of the city at 𝑝̅ w. The
variable m captures whatever penalty they incur from movement. Below, we test the
proposition that those white families in areas experiencing the greatest rates of black inmigration would have been the strongest supporters of a segregation ordinance with ward-level
data from St. Louis.
4. Empirical Evidence
To test the central predictions of the model above, we begin by looking at the factors that
predict whether a city passes segregation ordinances. Our theory suggests that the probability
24

of any given city passing a segregation ordinance is a positive function of black housing
demand, and a negative function of the ability of whites to police and enforce existing norms
governing segregation through private vigilante activity. Given this, we estimate probit models
of the following general form:
Pr(Yi = 1 | X) = Φ(X’𝛽),
where, Yi equals one if city i passes a segregation sometime between 1909 and 1917, and zero
otherwise; Φ is the standard normal distribution function; and X is a vector regressors
measuring the two channels that might drive demand for segregation ordinances (i.e., increased
housing demand among African Americans; and reductions in white vigilante activity and the
associated violence tax). A concern with our approach is the possibility that we might fail to
control for some sort of unobserved heterogeneity. Although we cannot fully control for such
concerns, we adopt some remedial strategies (described below) to test for and minimize biases
that might result from unobserved correlates.
To capture the housing demand channel, we look at population levels and growth in the
black community between 1910 and 1920. Presumably, the cities with the largest and fastest
growing black populations would have experienced the sharpest increases in black housing
demand and would have been the most likely to have passed segregation ordinances. To isolate
the private-vigilante-activity channel, we look at number of variables. These include: the size
and growth of the white population (which as explained elsewhere, would be negatively
correlated with the ability to provide private vigilante activity); the vitality of local volunteer
fire departments (an indirect indicator of the ability to provide local public goods through
25

private organizations); and lynching (a direct indicator of the intensity of private vigilante
activity).
We begin by gathering data on urban places in the American South and in the border
states with populations greater than 2,500 in 1910. We gather data on population levels and
growth rates, lynching rates, and the size of volunteer fire departments. We also the use the
history above (particularly table 1) to identify which of these places passed segregation
ordinances. The data on population are from the U.S. Census volumes, and the data on
volunteer fire departments are from the Fire and Marine Insurance Yearbook (1905-06). The
lynching data are from a widely used and cited map, available on-line through the Library of
Congress.12 Constructed by the Tuskegee Institute, this map records the number of lynchings
by county, for every county in the United States, for the years 1900 through 1931.
The resulting sample includes all cities for which data are available and contains 558
observations. Figure 5 provides a sense of the geographic distribution of our sample. Each
triangle indicates a city or town that did not pass a segregation ordinance, while the stars
indicate the location of a city that did pass a segregation ordinance between 1900 and 1917. The
map highlights the fact that, though few in number, segregation ordinances were passed in
cities throughout the South and various border states. That said, segregation ordinances were
particularly common in North Carolina and Virginia. To control for the clumping of
segregation ordinances in particular states, we include state fixed effects in some specifications.

26

Table 2 provides summary statistics for the key variables in our sample; the table also
shows how these variables differ across cities depending on passage of a segregation ordinance.
It is clear that cities passing segregation ordinances are much larger than cities that did not,
with white population levels in 1910 roughly 12 times in greater in the former. While black
population shares in 1910 are not radically different across the subsamples, black population are
roughly 8 times greater in cities that passed segregation ordinances than in those that did not.
Population growth between 1910 and 1920 for both blacks and whites are also greater in cities
passing segregation ordinances. Similar patterns emerge if we look at the data in logs.
The final two variables in Table 2 will be used to look at how the private provision of
public goods and private vigilante activity vary across cities. The first of these variables
captures the development of volunteer fire departments, an indirect indicator of how tightly
knit communities are and how willing local populations are to contribute to local public goods.
In cities without segregation ordinances, volunteer fire departments are roughly 5 times larger.
Similarly, lynching rates in the surrounding county are 10 times greater in cities without
segregation ordinances than in cities with such ordinances. The lynching rate is measured as
lynchings per 10,000 African Americans and is based on the number of lynchings in the county
in which a city is located.
The results of the probit analysis are reported in tables 3 and 4. Table 3 uses the data in
levels; Table 4 uses logs. To the extent that increased demand for housing in black
neighborhoods drove the passage of segregation ordinances, we would expect cities with the
largest and fastest growing African American populations to have been the most likely to have
27

passed segregation ordinances. The results provide only mixed support for this prediction. In
table 3, which uses levels and tests for evidence that proportional growth in the black
population matters, only regressions (1) and (5) yield evidence consistent with the demand
channel (see the coefficient on Pctblack in 1910). In table 4, the log of the black population
enters all five regression specifications at reasonable levels of significance, but the change in the
log of the black population between 1920 and 1910 is insignificant in all specifications. Also,
when state fixed effects are included in the regressions, there is little evidence that black
population levels and growth are important predictors of passage of segregation ordinances.
We find stronger econometric evidence for the second channel. In particular, the second
channel suggests that in cities where whites had a relatively strong capacity to provide public
goods privately, particularly those related to inter-racial violence, passage of municipal
segregation ordinances would have been delayed relative to places where whites did not have
such capacity. To explore this channel, we first look at how white population levels and growth
affect the likelihood of passing a segregation ordinance. In contrast to black population levels
and growth, white population pressures are strong and consistent positive predictors of
passage: cities with large and fast growing white populations were the most likely to pass
segregation ordinances. That white population pressure is a positive predictor of segregation
ordinances is consistent with the idea that white population growth undermined the ability of
whites to organize and coordinate the private vigilante activity necessary to deter black inmigration, which in turn, fostered demand for formal segregation ordinances. The evidence
that population pressures on the white community are important drivers of segregation
28

ordinances is strongest in the regression models that include state fixed effects. (See tables 3
and 4, regression models 2 and 5).
One might ask why if increases in the white population undermined the ability of whites
to organize private vigilante groups, why did those same pressures not also undermine the
ability of whites to lobby for segregation ordinances? There are at least two possible answers.
First, it is entirely possible that white political pressure for segregation ordinances was mostly
disorganized, and driven by the intensity of the preferences of the median white voter.
Consistent with this observation, many of the qualitative sources we consulted suggest that
pressure among (unorganized) white voters drove passage of segregation ordinances (e.g.,
Atlanta Constitution, Oct. 6, 1915, p. 1; Boger 2009; Meyers 2001, pp. 18-27; Powers 1983).
Second, white population pressures might well have reduced the ability to organize
political pressure groups, but as long as the costs of organizing politically were less affected by
population growth than the costs of organizing private vigilante groups the results above
would be sensible. Along the same lines, to be effective private action required sustained and
repeated efforts, but white vigilante activity often dissipated quickly—even the Klan, probably
the best organized and persistent white racist vigilante group saw waves of participation and
inaction (Fryer and Levitt 2012). By contrast, once it was passed, a segregation law was durable
and required little in the way of repeat organizational activity to sustain it. As one black
community leader described the situation, after a black family moved in, there would be some
violence, but “after a short time the excitement wore off” and whites would either move or
resign themselves to their fate (Meyer 2001, p. 17).
29

A more general objection to our interpretation of the positive coefficients on white
population levels and growth is that these are only indirect measures of the impact of the
vigilantism/public-goods-channel. Accordingly, we gather data on the size of volunteer fire
departments in American cities. To the extent that a large volunteer fire department in a city
reflects the ability of whites to organize and provide public goods through private mechanisms
(such as vigilante activity), we expect fewer segregation ordinances passed in cities with
relatively large volunteer fire departments. The results in table 3 are consistent with this
prediction: cities with active volunteer fire departments were less likely to pass segregation
ordinances than those with moribund departments. One concern with this test is that
residential segregation might have some sort of correlation with demand for fire protection.
The data, however, do not bear out this hypothesis: according to the results in table 3, the size
of the public fire departments is uncorrelated with the probability of passing a segregation
ordinance.
Unobservable factors correlated with demographic change in cities might bias our
analysis and so it is important to identify, and confront, plausible relationships on this margin.
Probably the most likely hypothesis in this regard would suggest that white segregation
ordinances reflect nothing more than the intensity of racial preferences among whites so that
cities where whites held the strongest anti-black preferences were the most likely to pass
segregation ordinances. Blacks would have been reluctant to migrate into such places, which

30

would suggest a negative coefficient on black population growth.13 Moreover, if most whites
preferred living around whites who held intense anti-black preferences, cities with the strongest
anti-black preferences would have experienced the most rapid population growth among
whites, which could account for the strong positive correlation between white population
growth and passage of segregation ordinances. This line of thinking suggests we include some
sort of control that captures the intensity of white animosity toward African Americans.
Another possible objection to our interpretation of the empirical results above is that we
do not have a direct measure of the informal organizations and arrangements that whites used
to exclude blacks from white neighborhoods. All we can do is say the negative coefficient on
white population growth is consistent with an erosion of such informal institutions. In an ideal
world we would have measures on the extent and efficacy of such things as neighborhood
associations and private vigilante activity taken in relation to black violations of established
racial housing norms. If segregation ordinances emerged only because those informal
institutions were breaking down (and segregation ordinances were in effect a substitute for
these private, informal institutions) one would expect these measures to be negatively
correlated with the passage of segregation ordinances.
To address both of these concerns, we add a measure of the lynching rate in the county
in which in the city is located to the regressions. To the extent that those cities with the
strongest and most virulent anti-black attitudes had the highest rates of lynching, lynching will

13

We note, however, that in the raw data, black population growth is much faster in cities passing
segregation ordinances than in those without such ordinances. See table 2.

31

capture the intensity of white animosity toward blacks. And if it is the intensity of white
preferences that drove passage of segregation ordinances, one expects that the lynching
measure would enter the regressions positively and that its inclusion would greatly reduce the
size and significance of the coefficients on the white (total) population level and growth rate.
Alternatively, if municipal segregation ordinances were passed because the ability of whites to
organize and punish blacks through private means was breaking down, one expects the
coefficient on the lynching rate to be negative and significant. In this way, the lynching rate is
ideal metric for distinguishing a preference-based explanation for municipal segregation
ordinances from our argument that segregation ordinances were substitutes for privatelyorganized vigilante activity.
The results are reported in tables 3 and 4, regressions 5 and 6. In table 3, the lynching
rate comes in highly significant, whether or not one includes state fixed effects. Moreover the
lynching rate is negative, which means that places that with lots of private vigilante activity
were less likely to pass segregation ordinances. This is consistent with the predictions of our
model and suggests that private vigilante activity and segregation ordinances were substitutes,
and not merely reflections of the intensity of anti-black preferences. In table 4, because we are
using logs and already controlling for population size, we do not use the lynching rate variable,
but instead simply include a count of lynchings in the county surrounding the city in question.
In regression 5, lynchings again enter with a negative sign and at a high level of significance. In
regression 6, the negative sign survives the inclusion of state fixed effects but the coefficient is
now only significant at the .106 level.
32

7. Voting Patterns in St. Louis
Our final source of systematic empirical evidence comes from St. Louis. In early 1916,
the St. Louis held a city-wide referendum on a segregation ordinance. If the majority of voters
in the city voted yes on the referendum, the segregation ordinance would become law. The
referendum passed with roughly two-thirds of the city voting in favor of the law: of the 70,000
ballots cast, more than 50,000 voted in favor of passage of the segregation ordinance. (Note also
that St. Louis is distinguished from most other cities in our sample in that blacks in border
states like Missouri could still vote, while those in the deeper South were fully disenfranchised
by this point in time.) We use this referendum vote to explore how variation in black housing
demand and white vigilante activity across wards predicts the proportion of voters casting
ballots in favor of the referendum. Regressing the ward-level votes and vote shares against
population levels and growth rates, the equations we estimate allow us to measure the
correlates of support for this law. Table 9 provides descriptive statistics of the ward level data.
In the first specification, we regress the number of yes votes in 1916 and against the size
of the black and white population in 1920, and the absolute change in the black and white
population between 1910 and 1920. See Table 6 for results. Assuming that most whites (blacks)
vote yes (no), the population levels in 1920 reflect the simple idea that wards with large white
(black) populations would have more yes (no) votes. The changes in the black and white
population are of primary interest because these two measures are the most likely to capture the
dynamics of housing market. Consistent with the predictions of our model, controlling for
population size, the number of yes votes was largest in wards experiencing rapid growth in the
33

black and white population between 1910 and 1920. As in the prior section, we are assuming
that growth in the black population is an indirect indicator of increases in black housing
demand, and that growth in the white population is an indirect and inverse measure of the
ability to organize privately to deter black in-migration into the ward.14
The final two columns of table 6 use a different dependent variable: yes votes as a
proportion of total votes cast. In these specifications, the proportion yes is lowest in wards with
high black population shares and in those experiencing rapid growth in the white population
(measured as the percentage change in the white population between 1910 and 1920). Also,
excluding the ninth ward (an outlier in terms of black population growth) from the regression
yields evidence that wards experiencing rapid growth in the black population (measured as the
percentage change in the black population between 1910 and 1920) had a higher proportion of
yes votes. Overall, these results provide mixed support for the black housing demand channel
increasing political support for the St. Louis segregation ordinance, and consistent support for
the vigilante activity channel.
7. Concluding Remarks
The existing literature on the origins of municipal segregation ordinances argues that
segregation ordinances were passed largely because of rapidly growing black populations in
urban areas and variation in the intensity anti-black preferences across cities. Our results

14

The logic of collective action suggests the ability to provide segregation through private vigilante
activity would have been lowest in those wards experiencing the most rapid growth in the white
population. This, in turn, would have generated demand for a formal segregation ordinance in those
same wards.

34

suggest the existing literature needs to be revised. While there is evidence that growing black
populations might have played a role in the propagation of segregation ordinances, the results
here suggest that a decline in the ability of whites to provide a local public good (i.e.
segregation) through private vigilante activity was especially important. In particular, the
negative coefficient on lynching and the positive coefficients on white population growth are
consistent with the hypothesis that segregation ordinances were passed in those cities where it
was becoming increasingly difficult for whites to organize and punish blacks for violating
established color lines in residential housing markets.
More generally, the model developed and tested here has broad implications for our
understanding of residential segregation the processes that give rise to it. Of particular interest
is the exploration of how market processes such as tipping interact with institutional change.
While prior research has tended to treat market-related processes such as tipping independently
from institutions, both formal and informal, the framework here integrates them. In the
process, it can help us understand political institutions and market processes work together to
drive segregation and make it persistent.
