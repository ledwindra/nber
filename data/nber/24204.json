In this we establish the neutrality of border-tax adjustments of the income tax; the welfare dominance of residence-based over source-based income taxation, albeit at the cost of a larger trade deficit; and the ineffectiveness of non-transitory border taxes as a means for reducing the trade deficit.\n\n",
