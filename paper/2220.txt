Smuggler's Blues at the Central Bank:
Lessons from Sudan

ABSTRACT

The ineffectiveness of real devaluation as stabilization policy does
not imply that the nominal exchange rate should be held constant in the
face of a domestic inflation. tn this circumstance, import duties and
export subsidies would have to be escalated to counter the potential
erosion of the trade balance. This escalation of trade barriers
generates a rising black market premium and offers increasing incentives
to smuggling, already a pervasive problem in the African countries. As a
consequence, the central bank would find it more and more difficult to
hold the nominal exchange rate constant. This leads us to consider a
passive exchange rate policy of stabilizing the real exchange rate by
moving the nominal rate in line with domestic inflation.
If such passive policy is not accompanied by the elimination of
trade barriers, however, the black market premium will not disappear.
Unless exchange rate policy and trade policy are consistent with each
other, the smuggler's blues will reach the central bank. Indeed, this is
not just a theoretical possibility, it is the major lesson from the
recent experience of Sudan.

Introduction: Real Devaluation and the Trade Balance
The usual analysis of the effects of real devaluation on trade flows

assumes a high degree of substitutability among final goods in corisuinp—

tion and among uses of inputs in production. Thus the typical analysis
assumes that all goods are final goods with domestic production of

import-competing goods and domestic consumption of exportables. A real
devaluation, by reducing the relative price of domestic output, encourages substitution from imports to home goods in consumption, and from pro-

duction for the home market to production for export. This high degree
of substitutability is usually reflected in an assumption that import
demand and export supply both have high elasticities with respect to the

real exchange rate. The result is a presumption that real devaluation
will improve the trade balance.

The structure of trade in same developing countries, especially in
sub-Saharan Africa, suggests a different analysis and result, however.

This was previously argued by Branson (1985) in the case of Kenya, and is

also applicable in Sudan. These countries have as a high proportion of
their imports intermediate inputs (such as oil) and capital equipment.

In Sudan, this proportion is approximately 80%. These are inputs into a
production structure that is to some degree rigidified by the existing
capital stock, reducing the short-run price elasticity of demand for

imports. These countries' exports are dominated by agricultural output

whose supply is inelastic in the shortrun. In both Kenya and Sudan, 90%
of exports are agricultural goods.

With inelastic import demand and export supply, a real devaluation
will tend to expand export revenues and import receipts proportionately
to their initial values in home currency, while leaving them unchanged in

-3-

foreign exchange. If the trade balance is initially in deficit, the real
devaluation may increase the deficit in home currency, deflating domestic

demand, with little gain in foreign exchange. This makes real devaluation potentially counterproductive as part of a stabilization program.

This ineffectiveness of real devaluation as stabilization policy
does not imply that the nominal exchange rate should be held constant in

the face of a domestic inflation, however. In this circumstance, import
duties and export subsidies would have to be escalated to counter the

potential erosion of the trade balance. This escalation of trade barriers generates a rising black market premium and offers increasing
incentives to smuggling, already a pervasive problem in the African

countries. As a consequence, the central bank would find it more and
more difficult to hold the nominal exchange rate constant. This leads us
to consider a passive exchange rate policy of stabilizing the real
exchange rate by moving the nominal rate in line with domestic inflation.
If such passive policy is not accompanied by the elimination of
trade barriers, however, the black market premium will not disappear.

Unless exchange rate policy and trade policy are consistent with each

other, the smuggler's blues will reach the central bank. Indeed, this is
not just a theoretical possibility, it is the major lesson from the
recent experience of Sudan.

The following section presents a basic model of the trade balance.
In this context, we show the consequences of rigidity in import demand

and export supply. We note as a by-product that wage indexation can
introduce a rigidity that replicates the results with inelastic export
supply and import demand.

-4-

Sections III and IV of the paper analyze the interaction of trade

barriers, smuggling and the black market premium. We first introduce
domestic inflation and trade barriers, to show the necessary escalation
of the latter to maintain the trade balance with a fixed nominal exchange

rate. We then show the effect of smuggling on legal as well as total
trade, and relate the rate of increase in the black market premium to the

rate of escalation of trade barriers. With a passive exchange rate
policy and a constant level of trade barriers, the black market premium

will be constant. We finally introduce capital account considerations,
showing they exacerbate the rise in the premium if the unreported trade
balance is in surplus, and conversely.
Section V applies the analysis to recent policy in Sudan.

II. Devaluation in the "Rigid" Economy
In this section we layout a simple model of export and import supply

and demand that illustrates the problems of the "rigid" economy. The
model is essentially the same as the one sketched in Branson (1972) and

developed in Branson and Katseli (1982). The duality with wage
indexation can also be easily demonstrated in this framework.

Export supply and demand can be described by the following two
log-linear equations, normalized on the home-currency price of exports p

for supply and the foreign-exchange price q for demand.

(1)

Supply:

(2) Demand:

ln

ln p + s —1 in

ln q =

ln

q - d

S

d

ln X

Here X is the quantity of exports, p is the cost of production of home
goods, and q is the cost of foreign substitutes for our exports. We can
interpret p as the opportunity cost of exports in the home economy;
later we will identify the rate of growth of p as the domestic inflation

rate. Foreign inflation would be interpreted as growth in q. Stating
export supply in terms of the home currency price reflects the assumption

that costs of producing exports are given in home currency. Stating
demand in terms of the foreign exchange price reflects the assumption
that exports compete with foreign goods in demand.
Supply and demand in the export market are brought together by the
exchange rate as "translator" between

(3)

and q:

-6-

The exchange rate is stated in terms of units of home currency per

unit of foreign exchange: an increase in e is a devaluation of the home
currency.

The export supply and demand model of equations (l)-(3) can be used

to track movements of export price and quantity as functions of the

domestic inflation rate p, the foreign inflation rate q, and changes in

nominal exchange rate .

currency price of exports is a weighted average of foreign influences

(e + q) and home influences p .

Alternatively,

the relative price of

exports in terms of home goods p/p is proportional to the real exchange
rate E =

eq/p,

and the same is true of the quantity of exports. If the

economy is "small" in the export market, dx -

If we impose the "rigid" economy assumption that Sx =

0,

export

revenue is fixed in foreign exchange. In home currency, export revenue
moves proportionately to the change in e, with p and q constant:

(6)

—7—

The duality result with domestic wage indexation can be obtained by

assuming that p = e + q with devaluation. This would be the result if
non-traded goods prices were a mark-up over wages, and wages are indexed

to the CPI. See Branson (1985) for the derivation. With p = e + q
from equations (4) and (5) we obtain again the result in equation (6).

This is the duality between wage indexation as commonly practiced in

Western Europe and the rigidity of s =

0,

which may be more relevant in

Africa.

We can re-interpret the duality result in a scenario of an on-going

domestic inflation with p =

the

rate of growth of domestic money. If

the economy is rigid, there is no fall in export quantity. However, the

profit squeeze that follows from the fall in p/p indicates that in the
long run resources will exit the export-producing sector.
The "passivet' exchange rate policy sets e

p = the

money

growth rate, with q assumed to be zero. This holds the quantity X constant with e = p

in equation (5). The home-currency price of exports

rises at the same rate as p; from (4) with k = 1,

= e =

p.

This holds p/p constant, preventing the profit squeeze in the
export sector. The result is that the passive exchange-rate policy with

e = p

"insulates" the exportable sector from the domestic inflation.

The analysis for imports follows by analogy, except that the

relevant rigidity is on the demand side. Import demand and supply are
given by

Here p represents competition from import-competing home goods, and q
represents foreign costs of production of imports. The small-country

assumption sets S =

, whereas,

in the "rigid" economy, d = 0.

The

translator between p and q gives us the third equation,

(9) Translator: in p

q.

The solutions for changes in import price and quantity m and M are
obtained from total differentiation of equations (7) -

They are:

p),

s/(s+d). The formal analogy to the export solutions is

obvious. In the small country, k' - 1 as Sm -

. In

the "rigid"

economy, d = 0 and k' = 1 also. Thus the rise in import payments is
equal to the devaluation. The same result can be obtained by again

imposing p = e in equations (10) and (11).
The duality result can be obtained by again imposing

p =

e

in equations (10) and (11). As in the export case, this result can be
reinterpreted to study the effects of a passive exchange-rate policy in

the face of domestic inflation. With an infinitely-elastic supply of
imports, the rise in domestic costs relative to import prices,

n'm'

squeezes profits in the import-competing sectors. If the economy is
"rigid," there is no increase in the quantity of imports in the short

run. But the profit squeeze in the import-competing sector, to the
extent it exists, would augur a longer-run rise in imports.

-9—

A passive policy that sets e =

p

releases this pressure.

The home—currency import price p rises at the same rate as

from (10) with k = p e =

p.

This holds p/p constant,

eliminating the profit squeeze in the import-competing industries, actual
or potential.

Combining the equations for import payments and for export receipts,
both in terms of home currency, we see that in the "rigid" economy they

increase in proportion to the change in the exchange rate. This means
that the increase in import payments exceeds that in export receipts if

the trade balance showed a deficit at the time of devaluation. So in the
"rigid" economy, real devaluation may be counter-productive. However,
the passive policy would hold a balanced trade position in the face of a
domestic inflation, with the quantities of exports and imports constant:

(12)

p +

X =

;m

+ N =

=e

; devaluation in the "rigid" economy.

Here, there is no movement in the foreign-exchange trade balance,

regardless of the initial condition: the passive policy insulates the

trade balance from the domestic inflation. This may be about the best we
can expect exchange-rate policy to do in a "rigid" economy.

-10-

111. Fixed Exchange Rates and Trade Barriers
An alternative to the passive policy of moving the exchange rate
with domestic inflation is to hold the nominal exchange rate constant and
use escalating trade barriers to offset the effect on trade quantities.

The basic idea is that rising import duties and export subsidies could
offset the effects on resource allocation from the increasing divergence
between non-traded goods prices and export and import prices.

The model of export supply and demand is modified by introduction of

a subsidy on top of the export price received by the seller. We
illustrate the case with ad valorem subsidy at rate s that multiplies the

export price

by a subsidy factor a =

r-ceived by exporters is ap,

(13)

in

Equilibrium

in a =

, and

+

s.

Thus the price actually

export supply becomes:

in n +

in the export market is shown in Figure 1. The demand

curve is equation (2) of section II in non-log, or exponential, form.

The underlying supply curve, the one without a a term, is equation (1).

The subsidy factor a

shifts

this supply curve down to give the

equilibrium intersection at E0. This shows a higher export volume and a
combination of a lower price paid by the buyer abroad and higher price
inclusive of the subsidy received by the home producer

than at the unsubsidized equilibrium E0. The figure shows that if
p, the domestic price, is rising due to domestic inflation and if the
nominal exchange rate e is constant, the export subsidy a must rise at
the same rate to hold the quantity X0 constant.

This result implies an increasing rate of growth of the actual

subsidy rate, since a =

s/(1+s),

where s is the increase in the

subsidy rate. The need for an increasing subsidy rate to provide a
constant rate of growth of the subsidy factor can be seen from a simple

example. If initially s = 0, imposition of a 10% subsidy will yield an
increase of 10% in a. But if the subsidy rate is 50%, so a =

1.5,

to

increase a by 10%, s will have to increase from 0.50 to 0.65, or 30%.

The equilibrium between export demand and subsidized supply in
equation (13), (2) and (3), and in Figure 1, is expressed in equations
(14) and (15) for changes in export quantity and market price net of
subsidy:

(14)

p, = k Ce + q) + (1

(15)

X =

ks[(e

q)

-

k)(p-

a),

(p - a)].

The subsidy factor a enters both solutions in tandem with the domestic

price index p. If an inflation driven by domestic money growth or other
domestic factors is driving the domestic price index p, and policy keeps
the nominal exchange rate e constant, then a growth rate of the export

subsidy factor a that equals the rate of inflation p would be needed to
hold the quantity of exports X constant.

Thus in an environment of domestic inflation with rapid monetary
growth, a policy of fixing the nominal exchange rate would destabilize

the real exchange rate E; in particular, if p grows rapidly, an attempt
to fix the nominal rate would yield a real appreciation of the exchange

rate and shrinking exports. As we see below, this has been the policy

-12-

response in Sudan- -stabilizing the nominal rate against movements in the
real rate.

A regime that attempts to eliminate the effects of stabilizing the
nominal rate in the face of a major appreciation of the real rate
requires, from equations (14) and (15), a rate of increase of the export

subsidy factor equal to the domestic inflation. The subsidy factor a

would have to rise at the domestic inflation rate p to hold X = X
0
n
in Figure 1. The subsidy rate itself would have to grow at an
increasing rate to provide a =

This would, of course, create an

ever—increasing incentive to false invoice sales as exports to obtain the

subsidy. This is part of the problem we see in developing countries
attempting to hold nominal exchange rates in the face of domestic

inflation. The policy increases incentives to move transactions to the
illegal sector.

The movement in an import tariff needed to hold the quantity of
imports constant in the face of a domestic inflation with a fixed nominal

exchange rate can be shown by analogy to the export subsidy model. With
an import tariff, import demand becomes:

(16)

in m + in t =

ln p -

d1ln

Nd.

The demand curve gives the total price in home-currency that
importers pay, inclusive of the tariff factor t =

1

+ t.

In equation

(16), p is the home—currency price the sellers of imports receive, t is
the ad-valorem tariff rate added by the government and tPm is the price
paid by the domestic purchaser.

-13-

The equilibrium in the import market with the import tariff factor t

is shown in Figure 2. The supply curve is equation (8) in section II in
exponential, or non-log, form. The non-tariff demand curve without a t
term is the demand curve of equation (7). These would yield the nontariff equilibrium E0. The tariff factor t shifts the demand curve
inclusive of the tariff down, giving the tariff-inclusive equilibrium at

E0. This shows a lower import quantity H0

than

without the tariff, with

a lower price received by the seller p, and a higher price paid by the
domestic buyer tPm•

It is clear from Figure 2 that for a given foreign price index q,
tariff factor t and exchange rate e, an increase in domestic prices

represented by p would shift the demand curves up, increasing import

prices and quantities. To prevent the increase in import quantity in
the face of a domestic inflation given by p, the tariff factor t

would have to increase at the same rate. This would hold M at H as p
0
n
increases. So, analogously to the export case, the import tariff factor
t would have to grow at the same rate as domestic inflation to hold the
quantity of imports constant.

As in the export case, a constant growth rate of the tariff factor t
requires an increasing rate of increase in the actual tariff rate, since
t =

t/(1+t).

To achieve a 10% increase in the tariff factor t (to

offset a 10% domestic inflation), if initially t

tariff will do. If initially t =

0.50,

0 (no tariff), a 10%

a 30% increase is needed.

The equilibrium between import supply and demand inclusive of the
tariff in equations (16), (8), and (9), and in Figure 2, is expressed in
equations (17) and (18) for changes in import quantity and market price
net of the import tariff:

The tariff factor t enters both equations in tandem with domestic

inflation p. With a domestic inflation driven by money growth and with
a fixed exchange rate, a growth of the tariff factor r equal to the
inflation rate would be needed to hold the quantity of imports H
constant.

Consider now the quota alternative to the tariff of Figure 2. If
the domestic price level is rising, the non-tariff demand curve shifts up

continuously. If a quota of H0 is imposed, the gap between the

continuously. This gap is the same as the tariff wedge tPm
Thus in an environment of a domestic inflation characterized by

ri

both the tariff and the subsidy factors would have to grow at the same
rate given to hold trade quantities constant with a fixed nominal

exchange rate. If tariffs and subsidies grow more slowly, import
quantity will rise and export quantity fall. But, with the tariff and
subsidy factors growing at the domestic inflation rate
(a =

t = p),

the regime with a fixed nominal exchange rate would offer

ever-increasing incentives to smuggling, through false invoicing or other

means. This, in turn, would generate a rising black market premium,
which would make it unsustainable to fix the nominal exchange rate.

-15-

IV. Trade Barriers, Smuggling and the Black Market Premium
Rising import tariffs induce smuggling and therefore provide an

extra obstacle to the fixed nominal rate policy. An importer will tend
to smuggle if the tariff is so high that it pays to purchase foreign
exchange in the black market at a premium it = eb/e greater than one,

given that the good imported may be confiscated by the government.
Denoting the probability of success in smuggling by z, if z t > it, the

importer will tend to smuggle more. We assume that the probability of
success depends on the ratio of smuggled to legal imports, denoted by m =

S/L
choose

so that, given trade barriers and the premium, an importer will
m such that expected profits are maximized. Associated with the

optimal m, there will be a probability of success z(m) and a domestic
price which can be expressed as a weighted average of the tariff factor
and the premium, with r > it a necessary condition for import smuggling to

occur. Rising subsidies, on the other hand, reduce the incentive to
smuggle exports but if the subsidy is smaller than the black market
premium weighted by the probability of success, or 'Y < Z it, it will pay

to smuggle more. Profits will be maximized for a smuggling ratio x

S/L, associated to a probability of success z(x) and a domestic price
of exports which can also be expressed as a weighted average of the
subsidy factor and the premium, with a < it a necessary condition for

export smuggling to occur. As a consequence, smuggling requires that t >
a initially, a condition which is necessarily met when we have an export

tax since then a < 1. The nature of the smuggling equilibrium is
discussed in Macedo (1985), and can be adapted to our purposes.

-16-

Domestic prices, net of tariff or subsidy, differ from the domestic
currency value of foreign prices at the official exchange rate by the
difference between the premium and trade barriers:

(19)

= n x z(x)/[cl + it x z(x)]

where

;m = e +

(20)

-

where m = nm/Ct +

We

itm).

now interpret planned smuggled imports as flow demand for black

market foreign exchange and successfully smuggled imports as flow supply

of black market foreign exchange. This determines the long-run black
market premium consistent with balanced legal and illegal trade. As
before, we set foreign prices q at unity, then if legal exports equal

legal imports (L = Lm) and successfully smuggled exports pay for planned
smuggling imports (Z(X)S =

S),

the smuggling ratios must satisfy the

trade balance equilibrium are such that:

(21)

z(x) x = m

Using (21) to solve for the black market premium and the smuggling
ratios in terms of trade barriers, it can be shown that these only depend

on the ratio p =

t/a,

with a coefficient capturing the inverse of the sum

of the elasticities of the demand for and supply of black market foreign

exchange with respect to trade barriers. An increase in t increases

—17—

smuggling only if a does not increase in proportion. The premium,
however, increases with both, since it is a weighted average of t and a.
It can be expressed as:

Tt =

(22)

t - m'mx1

where c(a) is the elasticity of demand for (supply of) black
market foreign exchange.

Using (22) in (19) and (20), it is seen that an increase in the
tariff (subsidy) raises (lowers) the domestic net price of exports and
lowers (raises) the domestic net price of imports because of the induced

increase (decrease) in smuggling. Note also that in the benchmark case
where t

=a

=

it = 1,

the

coefficients become the share of import

smuggling (or of successful export smuggling) in total trade, denoted by
We can then write the condition for the smuggling equilibrium to
exist as

>
x

>
o

m

The smuggling model summarized above can now be adapted to the model

of section III. Under the simplifying assumption that the government
does not resell confiscated smuggled goods, exports supplied by home
producers (XS) are greater than exports demanded by foreign consumers
0

(X ) and greater than legal exports (L) whereas imports demanded by home

consumers (Md) are smaller than imports supplied by foreign producers

(MS) but still greater than legal imports CL). Since the differences
involve the smuggling ratios for

and N5 and those multiplied by the

probability of success in smuggling for X5 and Md,they can be expressed
as a function of the ratio of trade barriers:

The equality of the wedge between between exports demanded and legal
exports on the one hand and between imports supplied and legal imports on
the other is a consequence of the long-run equilibrium condition
expressed in (21).

Before substituting for quantities in the log differential of the
demand and supply equations from sections II and III and solving the
model for prices and legal quantities, we note that the solution will be
the same as above if p = 0, so that the rule Pu =

t=a

still keeps total

import and export quantities constant. The difference, of course, is
that the black market premium is growing at the same rate

independently

=

of the changes in the official exchange rate.

It is convenient to write the solution relative to the no-smuggling

model of section III, denoted by a L superscript. We then have:

(27)

p =

We see that the price of exports is always higher than without
smuggling, and, in the case of a small economy, the price of imports also

increases with rising tariffs. Quantities legally traded are ambiguous.
In the "rigid" economy, legal trade falls but a rise in the value of
imports and exports requires that the foreign exchange elasticities be
greater than one:

(34)

is seen that for the small country total trade rises. The only

case where this would not obtain is for a country with monopoly power on

the import side, say k'O. A country with monopoly power on the export
side would still increase its total exports relative to the no-smuggling
situation.

-20-

The smuggling model shows therefore that, even in the "rigid"

economy, legal trade will only fall if tariffs are rising faster than

subsidies. However, the black market premium will be growing at the same
rate as trade barriers.

To analyze this phenomenon we need to model the short-run black
market premium, which importers and exporters take as given because it
makes the stock of black market foreign exchange willingly held, as in
Macedo (1982).

In this connection, the importance of a given short-term premium is
that in order for smuggling to exist, it must be such that t > Tt > a.

Alternatively put, the observed premium provides a lower bound for import
tariffs and an upper bound for export subsidies.

The analysis is in Macedo (1985). For our purposes, it is
sufficient to stress that if the reported trade balance is zero, the
unreported trade balance in foreign currency is given by:

B "

When the premium is higher than the weighted average of trade

barriers, the unreported balance is in surplus and conversely. The
effect of capital flight is therefore to exacerbate the rise in the
premium.

V. Lessons from Sudan
Exchange-rate stability is desirable in a developing country because
it eliminates a major source of uncertainty as the traded-goods sectors

develop. As we saw above, an attempt to stabilize the nominal exchange
rate in the face of domestic inflation will require increasing trade
restrictions and the rising incentives they provide for illegal activity.

An alternative objective is stabilization of the real exchange rate so as
to insulate the traded-goods sectors and the trade balance from domestic

inflation. To stabilize the real exchange rate, the nominal rate e
should be moved to offset the home inflation differential. For a constant E, the nominal rate e would follow the rule

(36)

ep-q
Once we have accepted, on principle, that the objective for

exchange-rate stabilization is the real exchange rate, we face the
question: to which nominal rate do we apply the rule given in equation

(36)? The dollar rate? The sterling rate? An average? Do we use
import or export weights in forming the average? The general answer to
these questions is that the real effective exchange rate can be
stabilized by applying the rule of equation (36) to a nominal effective
note, where the same set of weights is used in calculating the effective

nominal rate e and the effective traded-goods price q. The optimal
choice of weights is discussed in some detail in Branson and Katseli

(1982). In the absence of market power in either export or import markets for a small country like Sudan, the appropriate choice is likely to

be total trade weights. Thus the nominal effective rate and traded-goods

-22-

price can be formed by making a weighted average across the sum

of

exports and imports by trading partner. The nominal exchange rate of a
selected nulneraire currency such as the U.S. dollar can then be moved so

that the effective nominal rate follows equation (36).

The data on official effective exchange rates for the Sudan are

summarized in Appendix Tables 1-3. The left-hand side of each Table
shows the export, import, and total trade weights for the Sudan's fifteen
largest trading partners, with data drawn from the IMF's

International Financial Statistics. Appendix Table 1 gives the weighted

relative price index p/q (1980 = 100) for the Sudan using export,
import, and total trade weights, and a three-country approximation

weighting Saudi Arabia by .5 and the U.S. and U.K. by .25 each. Appendix
Table 2 gives the same calculation for the nominal effective rate e, and

Appendix Table 3 (and Figure 3) shows the real effective rate E. In both
tables, an increase in the exchange rate index is an appreciation.
After two decades of relative price stability, the relative price
index in Appendix Table 1 goes from 60 in 1976 to 64 in 1977 and 73 in

1978. This was the beginning of a period of accelerating inflation. As
the inflation began in 1977, the nominal rate was not allowed to move

until 1978. Subsequently, it was increased (depreciation of the Sudanese
currency) in irregular jumps, compared to the fairly smooth relative
inflation path.

The combination of steadily accelerating inflation and irregular
movement of the nominal exchange rate resulted in the unstable movement

in the real effective rate, as shown in Figure 3. After the late 1960s,

the real effective rate fell in an unstable manner to 1980. This real
appreciation was bad for output of traded goods and the trade balance.

The instability of year-to-year movement in the real rate raises risk and
may reduce investment in the traded-goods sector.

The situation worsened after 1980. A sharp real appreciation came
in 1981 as the nominal rate was held nearly constant against a rising

domestic inflation. The sharp devaluation in 1982 gave a large depreciation in the real effective rate, and the nominal appreciation (!) in 1984
resulted in an appreciation of the real rate back to its level in 1980.

While the causes of the accelerated inflation of the seventies are
controversial, it is worth recalling that, after the first oil crisis,

the Sudanese authorities embarked on a development program designed to

make their country the "bread basket" of the Gulf states. The eagerness
of these states to provide development aid to the Sudan as well as the
significant migration of Sudanese workers toward the Gulf would seem to

have relaxed the foreign exchange constraint. Nevertheless, when Sudan
negotiated with the fliP in 1978, it was already in a very difficult

financial situation. Nashashibi (1980) illustrates the decline in the
competitiveness of major crops in the mid-seventies. Hussain and
Thirwall (1984) find the same tendency after the 1978 devaluation. It is
as yet unclear whether the deterioriation of Sudan's solvency in seven
years of agreements with the IMF is mostly attributable to errors in

policy and/or policy advice. An alternative hypothesis, put forth by
Brown (1984, 1985), argues that both the United States and the Arab
countries managed to use the IMF's "seal of approval" to continue lending

to a friendly government. The ability of Sudan to continue dealing with
the lilY despite arrears on its debt to the Fund is, of course, consistent

with Brown's hypothesis but is not sufficient to establish it. In any
event, the situation did deteriorate until negotiations with the HIP

broke down in late 1984. In early February 1986, the fliP announced it
was ceasing to lend to Sudan.
The 1979 partial unification, rather than part of any agreement,

seems to have been an initiative of the Sudanese authorities. The
financial liberalization which accompanied the partial unification of the
exchange rate turned out to have very severe consequences because, while
broadening the market where a free exchange rate was determined, it did

not induce a more credible official exchange rate policy. As a
consequence, the free market premium became a signal of the inability of
the authorities to manage the economy and was accordingly viewed with

suspicion by the central bank. This may well have exacerbated the
potential of informal financial markets for bubbles and crashes, as
indeed became reality in 1984-85 (see Figure 4).

Going back to the reforms, they continued to be implemented in 1980

and 1981. Further measures toward "the simplification and unification of
the exchange rate" are mentioned in the Annual Report of the Bank of

Sudan (1980, p. 50). In September, according to Awad (1985), the
official rate became 60 piastres per dollar, the special rate 80 piastres
while the free market rate was at 125 piastres, a premium of 2.08, much
higher than the average of 1.76 reported in Table 1.

The unification of the exchange system is dated in BS (1981) in

November 1981, at a rate of 90 piastres per dollar. According to Awad
(1985), the premium was then 1.5, whereas a USAID document reports no
premium (i.e. 1.0).

But the unification only lasted a few months. In March 1982, the
commercial rate rose to 135 piastres, only slightly below the free market

rate of 145. In November, the official rate was set at 130 piastres and

the commercial rate at 175, again very close to the free market rate.

While the official rate remained at that level until February 1985 (when
it became 250 piastres) the commercial rate was raised to 180 piastres in
March of 1983, BS (1983, P. 64) and to 210 piastres in October 1984.

Before that, however, the official rate was only applicable to the
imports of petroleum and some pharmaceuticals because agricultural

exports were valued at a combined rate of 142 piastres (obtained by

weighing the official rate with 3/4 and the commercial rate with U.

Indeed, by then, the commercial rate itself was only applicable to
specific "priority" imports.

While during the IMP-period there continued to be continuous changes
in exchange rate policy, the major difference with the previous period is
the decline in the premium and the real devaluation against the dollar.

This started in 1979 for the free market exchange rate and continued

until 1984. For the official rate, it is limited to the period
1981-1983. But, as before, the shift of transactions to the commercial
rate makes the true pattern look less volatile than the numbers reported
in Table 1 above.

The "strong dollar" also causes problems of interpretation, but both
the 15 partner real effective exchange rate (using total trade weights)
and the simplified three partner rate mirror the evolution of the

official real dollar rate. There is of course a difference in magnitude.
To a real depreciation of 66% against the dollar in 1982-83, corresponds

a 40% depreciation against major trading partners. The real appreciation
of 1984 is also much larger relative to trading partners (15:23%, 3:20%)

than relative to the dollar (-13%). The free rate, on the other hand,

-26-

depreciated by 10% in real terms, underscoring the substantial increase
in the average premium over the years, to almost 1.9.

The decline in the premium during the period of IMF devaluations was
consistent with a smoother functioning of the free market than the
authorities were willing to acknowledge.

Almost by definition, there is little information on quantities

transacted in the free, or "black", markets for foreign exchange. The
percentages reported in Appendix Table 4 are shares of total
transactions, based on data reported by private dealers to the central

bank and consolidated in Macedo (1986). The shares are considerable both
on the export and on the import side, especially if the premium is taken

into account by converting values into domestic currency. The data is
subject to caveats, since the authorizations to private dealers were
revoked from February 10, 1983 through end of January, 1984, at which
time the commercial banks virtually ceased to deal in foreign exchange
since they would not use the free market rate.

Comparing various sources and methods, Appendix Table 5 reports the

share of unreported transactions. It shows smuggling ratios of .37
(27/100-27) for commodity imports and .49 for commodity exports. The
figures on the bottom panel show the importance of smuggling for
government transactions (cotton, oil, petroleum, sugar) as well as for
livestock.

Appendix Table 6 analyzes the structure of the free market by
currency composition, showing a very dominant but variable share for the

U.S. dollar, and by firm concentration. While the number of authorized
dealers increases substantially during 1984, many of them had a very
small share of the market so that the average number equivalent

-27-

Herfindahi index for the year is 5.6. This shows a degree of competition
far greater than generally believed. For example, Dixit (1985) computes
a similar number for U.S. auto firms and finds 2 or 8, depending on

whether divisions are counted as separate entities. Another indicator,
reported in the last column, is average transaction per authorized

dealer. The pattern is erratic, and it would be difficult to ascribe
declines to increases in competition in the usual way. But the size of
the market was very variable due to the emerging bubble and seasonal
factors tend to explain the Summer bulge.

Another piece of evidence concerns remittances. Their importance
for the free market is evident from Appendix Table 5. The reported
figures show a smuggling ratio of about one, confirmed by the figures

based on potential savings reported below, which give 1.11. In a 1983
study of Sudanese workers abroad, discussed by Harris (1986), however,
the smuggling ratio for remittances is as high as 7.27, so that as a

share of output they would represent 37% rather than 5%. Even if such
figure is grossly exaggerated, it seems clear that the stock of foreign
exchange held by Sudanese determines the premium in the short run, as
postulated in our analysis.

Appendix Table 7 shows that the intended use of these remittances

generally requires imports (the exception may be housing). As a
consequence, only a small part of the stock of foreign assets held by
Sudanese residents is directed to supply foreign exchange to the Khartoum

black market. This may account for the low level of net inflows or
outflows reported in Appendix Table 4. Harris (1986) also claims that
the stock - which he estimates at $2 billion -

is held

outside Sudan but

does not draw the implications for the price of foreign exchange.

-28-

Despite the caveats about the quality of the data, this evidence
strongly suggests that smuggling and the free market for foreign exchange
cannot be ignored in the design of official exchange rate policy in

Sudan: the smuggler's blues made its way to the central bank! The black
market has offset the effects of official exchange rate policy leading to
movements in the premium that were determined by stock demand for foreign
assets as well as smuggling activity.

In sum, the failure to match movement in the nominal exchange rate
to relative inflation sharply destabilized the real effective rate after

1980. The attempts at stabilizing the nominal exchange rate destabilized
the real rate, discouraging investment in the traded-goods sectors and

providing inventives for illegal activity. The objective for exchange
rate policy in the Sudan may well be stability, but stability of the real
exchange rate and the black premium premium, not the nominal official
rate against the dollar.
