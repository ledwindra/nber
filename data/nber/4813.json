    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper highlights unanswered research questions in the economics of retirement, and shows how these issues can be addressed using the new Health and Retirement Survey (HRS).  Unique features of the survey are described including administrative records on earnings and social security benefits, and employer provided data on pensions and health insurance.  Also collected are indicators of retirement plans, health status, family structure, income, wealth and employer policies affecting job opportunities and constraints.  Data from the first wave of the HRS are used to analyze retirement outcomes and constraints shaping retirement behavior.\n\n",
