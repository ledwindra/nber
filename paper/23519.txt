Heterogeneous Yield Impacts from Adoption of Genetically Engineered Corn and the Importance
of Controlling for Weather
Jayson L. Lusk, Jesse Tack, and Nathan P. Hendricks
NBER Working Paper No. 23519
June 2017
JEL No. C23,O47,Q16
ABSTRACT
Concern about declining growth in crop yields has renewed debates about the ability of
biotechnology to promote food security. While numerous experimental and farm-level studies
have found that adoption of genetically engineered crops has been associated with yield gains,
aggregate and cross-country comparisons often seem to show little effect, raising questions about
the size and generalizability of the effect. This paper attempts to resolve this conundrum using a
panel of United States county-level corn yields from 1980 to 2015 in conjunction with data on
adoption of genetically engineered crops, weather, and soil characteristics. Our panel data contain
just over 28,000 observations spanning roughly 800 counties. We show that changing weather
patterns confound simple analyses of trend yield, and only after controlling for weather do we
find that genetically engineered crops have increased yields above trend. There is marked
heterogeneity in the effect of adoption of genetically engineered crops across location partially
explained by differential soil characteristics which may be related to insect pressure. While
adoption of genetically engineered crops has the potential to mitigate downside risks from weeds
and insects, we find no effects of adoption on yield variability nor do we find that adoption of
presently available genetically engineered crops has led to increased resilience to heat or water
stress. On average, across all counties, we find adoption of GE corn was associated with a 17
percent increase in corn yield.

Although agriculture has historically experienced one of the highest rates of productivity growth
in the U.S. economy (Jorgenson, Gollop, Fraumeni, 1987), there is evidence that agricultural
productivity growth is beginning to slow (Alston, Andersen, and Pardey, 2015; Alston, Beddow,
and Pardey, 2009; Ray et al., 2012). The decline in productivity growth has coincided with
concerns about food price spikes, social instability, food insecurity, population growth, drought,
and climate change (Bellemare, 2015; Ray et al., 2013; Roberts and Schlenker, 2013; Schlenker
and Roberts, 2009; Tack, Barkley, and Nalley, 2015). This confluence of problems has prompted
interest in determining whether certain technologies can promote gains in crop yields, and none
has been more controversial than biotechnology.
Many previous studies have investigated whether adoption of genetically engineered (GE)
crops has increased yield (e.g., see reviews in Fernadez-Cornejo et al., 2014; Klümper and Qaim,
2014; National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM), 2016), and the
consensus from the micro-level data and experimental studies is that adoption of GE crops,
particularly insect-resistant Bt varieties targeting the corn borer, have generally been associated
with higher yield. However, ample skepticism remains, with high profile popular publications
purporting that GE crops have failed to live up to their promise of yield increases (e.g., Foley,
2014; Gurian-Sherman, 2009; Hakim, 2016).
A variety of factors might explain the divergence in views about the yield effects of GE
crops, but one of the main issues is that adoption of GE crops does not appear to have had much
effect on trend yields when investigating national-level yield data (Duke, 2015) nor do yield trends
appear much different in developed countries that have and have not adopted GE varieties
(Heinemann et al., 2014). As the NASEM (2016) put it (p. 66), “the nation-wide data on maize,
cotton, or soybean in the United States do not show a significant signature of genetic-engineering

1

technology on the rate of yield increase.” This raises the question of whether the yield-increasing
effects of GE crops observed in particular locations and experiments generalize more broadly, and
if so, does the impact on crop yields vary spatially?
In this paper, we show that simple analyses of yield trends mask important weather-related
factors that influence the estimated effect of GE crop adoption on yield. Coupling county-level
data on corn yields from 1980 to 2015 and state-level adoption of GE traits with data on weather
variation and soil characteristics, a number of important findings emerge. First, changes in weather
and climatic conditions confound yield effects associated with GE adoption. Without controlling
for weather, adoption of GE crops appears to have little impact on corn yields; however, once
temperature and precipitation controls are added, GE adoption has significant effects on corn
yields. Second, the adoption of GE corn has had differential effects on crop yields in different
locations even among corn-belt states. However, we find that ad hoc political boundaries (i.e.,
states) do not provide a credible representation of differential GE effects. Rather, alternative
measures based on soil characteristics provide a broad representation of differential effects and are
consistent with the data. In particular, we find that the GE effect is much larger for non-sandy soils
with a larger water holding capacity. Overall, we find that GE adoption has increased yields by
approximately 18 bushels per acre on average, but this effect varies spatially across counties
ranging from roughly 5 to 25 bushels per acre. Finally, we do not find evidence that adoption of
GE corn led to lower yield variability nor do we find that current GE traits mitigate the effects of
heat or water stress.
To be sure, there are several other benefits from the adoption of GE crops beyond increased
yields. The non-yield benefits have come in the form of labor savings, reduced insecticide use, and
improved weed and pest control which has facilitated the ability to adopt low- and no-till

2

production methods, alter crop rotations, and utilize higher planting densities (Chavas et al., 2014
Fernadez-Cornejo et al., 2014; Klümper and Qaim, 2014; Perry, Moschini, and Hennessy, 2016;
Perry et al., 2016). Revealed preferences of US farmers indicate producer benefits over and above
the substantially higher price of GE corn relative to conventional (Shi, Chavas, and Stiegert, 2010).
The rapid adoption of GE corn by farmers also provides evidence of these benefits. GE corn was
first grown commercially in the US in 1996. In just four years, a quarter of the corn acres were
planted with a GE trait and in less than ten years, adoption had spread to more than half the US
corn acres. In 2016, 92 percent of US corn acres were planted with GE corn, with 81 percent of
the total GE corn acreage being planted with “stacked” varieties that are both insect resistant and
herbicide tolerant. It is also important to recognize that GE crops can increase production through
expansions of area planted to the crop (i.e., the extensive margin) because greater yields and lower
costs of production provide incentives to expand crop production (Barrows, Sexton, and
Zilberman, 2014).
Nonetheless, discussion of yield impacts of GE crops remains at the forefront of public
discussions about whether and to what extent biotechnology can contribute to food security and
help mitigate the effects of climate change. In response to the finding that GE adoption does not
appear to alter national-level yield trends, NAESM (2016) recommended research (p. 66), “should
be conducted that isolates effects of the diverse environmental and genetic factors that contribute
to yield.” Our objective here is to help fill this gap in the literature.
The next section reviews some of the research on the yield effects of GE crops, and we
delineate our contribution to the literature. The third and fourth sections discuss the data and
methods, followed by the presentation of results. The last section concludes.

Background
GE crops currently on the market do not increase yield per se. However, they can reduce the gap
between actual and potential yield by reducing the adverse effects of weeds and insects (NAESM,
2016). It is also possible that crops with GE traits can reduce yields if introduced into less
productive varieties not ideally suited to a particular growing region (Shi, Chavas, and Lauer,

represent observed yields, solid black line is linear yield trend, and dashed red line is percent of corn acres
planted with GE corn; data are from USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service.

Figure 1 shows the national trend in US corn yield and the adoption of GE corn from 1980
to 2016. The figure suggests, in the words of Duke (2014, pg., 653), “yields have continued to
increase at the same rate as before introduction [of GE crops].” Leibman et al. (2014) similarly
investigated aggregate yields and found after adoption of GE corn a small (0.5 bushes/acre) trend

4

increase; however, no tests of statistical significance were performed. These sorts of aggregate
comparisons make no attempt to control for potentially confounding factors such as weather which
could have coincidentally been worse in the 1980s before the adoption of GE corn. Controlling for
weather in a national-level trend analysis is difficult due to the nonlinear impacts of weather on
yield and highly spatially heterogeneous weather conditions within the country. This motivates the
use of disaggregate data to test the impact of GE adoption on yields.
These aggregate investigations can be contrasted with the large literature from agronomic
experimental studies that attempt to hold constant many factors such as location and germplasm.
Nolan and Santos (2012) summarize the results of more than 30 such studies mainly published
between 2000 and 2003. None of the reviewed studies report a statistically significant negative
effect associated with Bt GE corn, and nearly all reported positive yield effects associated with Bt
GE trait, with yield gains as high as 19 percent. In their analysis, Nolan and Santos (2012)
combined datasets from multiple experiments conducted by ten different state agricultural
extension services from 1997 to 2009. They found, after controlling for weather, agronomic inputs,
management, and soil characteristics that planting of Bt GE corn led to yield gains of around 14
bushels/acre, although when the only GE trait present was herbicide tolerance, yield was
unaffected or slightly negative. Despite finding that yield was affected by location, weather, and
soil characteristics, the authors did not investigate whether these factors interacted with the GE
effect (i.e., whether GE yield gains were higher or lower in different locations, in different weather
patterns, or in different soils).
As shown by Shi, Chavas, and Lauer (2013), however, there is likely ample heterogeneity
in the effects of GE adoption on mean yield and on yield variance. Using experiment data from
agricultural experiment stations in Wisconsin from 1990 to 2010, Shi, Chavas, and Lauer (2013)

5

found GE traits had variable effects on corn yields, depending on the type of GE trait introduced
and how long the trait had been used in production, with mean yields significantly increasing
relative to conventional non-GE corn for some traits (namely Bt targeted at the European corn
borer) but not others (namely, herbicide-tolerant only GE corn and GE corn with Bt targeted only
at corn rootworm). Additional analysis of the same data by Shi et al. (2013) suggests some of the
yield gains attributable to GE hybrids were a result of improvements in non-GE germplasm and
the wider availability of higher quality germplasm. However, regardless of the GE trait analyzed,
the authors found a consistent effect on yield variance, with GE crops reducing the variance of
corn yields. The authors conclude that GE crops have helped farmers reduce their risk exposure.
As was the case in Nolan and Santos (2012), Shi, Chavas, and Lauer (2013) did not
investigate whether the yield effects of GE traits were affected by location, management practices,
soil type, etc. However, there are reasons to believe the potential yield effects of GE adoption are
not uniform across location or time. Currently available GE traits rely on Bt to provide protection
against the European corn borer and/or corn rootworm and/or are tolerant to certain herbicides
(primarily glyphosate). While there are fewer agronomic reasons to suggest herbicide tolerance
would convey significant yield benefits, insect resistance can plausibly lower the gap between
potential and realized yield. As discussed in Noland and Santos (2012), conventionally applied
insecticides only provide 60 percent to 80 percent protection against corn borer and rootworm,
whereas Bt provides near 100 percent protection. As such, the effect of Bt GE corn relative to
conventional corn depends on pest pressure. It has long been known that corn borer and corn
rootworm pressures are affected by soil characteristics and by weather (e.g., Beck and Apple, 1961;
Huber, Neiswander, and Salter, 1928; Turpin and Peters, 1971; MacDonald and Ellis, 1990), and
prior research has hinted at the fact that yield effects of Bt corn might depend on soil characteristics

6

via their effects on insect populations (Ma, Meloche, and We, 2009). Pest pressure is also likely
to vary spatially according to the density of corn production, which depends on soil and climatic
conditions.
In a paper most similar to the present inquiry, Xu et al. (2013) used aggregate, nonexperimental data and found that GE adoption led to a 19.4 bushel/acre increase in corn yields in
the central corn belt (Illinois, Indiana, and Iowa). What explains the contrast between the apparent
lack of impact of GE adoption in aggregate trend yields shown in figure 1 and the results from Xu
et al. (2013)? There are a variety of possibilities. For example, Xu et al. (2013) look at county
(rather than national) yields, and they control for confounding factors related to weather and
fertilizer use. However, it is unclear from Xu et al. (2013) what the impacts are of ignoring these
factors. Moreover, these authors only considered limited geographic heterogeneity (they only
explored central corn belt to non-central corn belt) and they did not consider other factors like soil
characteristics or how weather and soil characteristics may influence GE-adoption effects on yield.
In addition, the authors did not consider the effects of GE adoption on yield variability.
Another confounding factor that exists when exploring national yield trends is the fact that
the number of acres planted to corn has increased significantly over the same period of time that
GE traits have been adopted. For example, in ten years from 1980 to 1989 prior to adoption of GE
corn, 75.7 million acres of corn were planted on average each year in the US. By contrast, in the
most recent ten-year period from 2007 to 2016, during a period of near full adoption of GE traits,
on average 91.2 million acres of corn were planted each year in the US, a 20.5 percent increase.
Some of the acreage expansion is a result of GE adoption as GE traits have increased the viability
of continuous corn (planting corn after corn rather than rotating with soybeans) (Chavas et al.,
2014), a practice which has historically been associated with significant yield drag (Gentry et al.,

7

2013). Ethanol policies, among other factors, also led to dramatic increase in corn prices over the
period of GE corn adoption, which both increased the prevalence of continuous corn (Hendricks
et al., 2014) and led to expansion of corn onto acres which would previously have been considered
marginal lands. Combined, these factors suggest national corn yields would have been higher in
recent years had it not been for the expansion of corn acreage.

Data
We utilize a large panel of roughly 28,000 yield observations spanning 819 counties from 19802015. We chose 1980 as the starting point for the time series as this gives us a roughly equal
number of years pre- and post-GE adoption, which started in 1996. Roughly 13,000 (45 percent)
of the yield observations correspond to the pre-GE period. These data were collected via USDA
National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) Quick Stats and correspond to total production
divided by harvested acres in each county. As in Xu et al (2013), we omit any county where (i)
more than 10 percent of harvested cropland is irrigated or (ii) yield data was reported for less than
two-thirds of the pre-GE years or two-thirds of the post-GE years. Figure S1 shows that there exists
extensive cross-sectional and temporal variation of yields. Note that all tables and figures with a
leading “S” are contained in the accompanying supplementary material.
The limiting factor for the cross-sectional (spatial) representation of the data is the
availability of GE adoption data. We utilize the same NASS data as Xu et al (2013), which reports
GE adoption at the state-year level for 13 states: Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan,
Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, Texas, and Wisconsin. These
data were first recorded in 2000, for all but North Dakota and Texas which started recording in
2005, several years after adoption had already started to occur in some areas. We interpolate

8

missing data using predictions from a generalized linear model with a binomial family and a logit
link function. A pooled model with state fixed effects provides similar predictions as separate
models for each state. We use the latter here. Our interpolation procedure follows the seminal work
of Griliches (1957) who modeled the diffusion of hybrid corn seed as logistic growth. Figure S2
provides the observed adoption data in addition to the predictions from both models used to
interpolate missing values. Table S1 provides summary statistics for both the observed and
observed-plus-interpolated GE adoption rate variables. Figure S3 provides a spatial map of the insample counties studied in the analysis.
While our analysis focuses on identifying the effects of GE adoption on corn yields, it is
likely that one must control for several sources of confounding factors in practice. For example, if
the period of adoption post 1996 coincided with an abnormal run of good or bad weather
conditions, then failure to control for weather could bias the estimate of the GE effect. Recent
evidence suggests that this can be an important consideration for crop yield analyses (Tack,
Barkley, and Nalley, 2015). We use the same weather data as in Schlenker and Roberts (2009)
updated to 2015 to control for the influence of weather on corn yields. Daily outcomes on
minimum and maximum temperatures at the county level are interpolated within each day using a
sinusoidal approximation, and are then used to construct three degree-day variables: between 0
and 10°C, 10 and 29°C, and above 29°C. Along with cumulative precipitation, these variables are
aggregated across March-August. Figure S4 shows that there is extensive variation both crosssectionally and over time for these variables.
Soil characteristic data are from the gSSURGO (Gridded Soil Survey Geographic) database
created by NRCS (Natural Resources Conservation Service) and were also used in Hendricks
(2016). Soils are aggregated to the county level using only the area in the county classified as

9

cropland according to the National Land Cover Database. One measure of soil quality that we
consider is water holding capacity (measured in mm), which is the total volume of plant-available
water that the soil can store within the root zone and is calculated as a weighted average across the
county. Figure S7 provides a spatial map of the water holding capacity across counties, which has
a wide range from near zero to just over 300 mm and a sample average value of 216 mm. Another
measure we consider is a grouping of soil types based on the soil texture of the county. This is
calculated as the dominant soil texture classification within the county, and includes nine different
soil types: clay, clay-loam, loam, loamy-sand, sand, sandy-loam, silt-loam, silty-clay, and siltyclay-loam. Figure S8 provides a spatial map of these soil types by county.

Empirical Model
We assume that the effect of GE adoption on corn yields is identified using the regression model

yist =
α + δ Ait* + f (xist , γ ) + ε ist
where yist are corn yields (bu/acre) in county i, state s, and year t. The variable Ait* is the
unobserved GE adoption rate at the county-year level and is measured as the fraction of acreage
planted to GE varieties. The parameter of interest is δ , which measures the effect of GE adoption
on corn yields. We discuss the implications of only observing adoption rates at the state-year level
in the next section. We also include a vector of control variables xist that include county-level
fixed effects, state-level trend variables, and weather variables that are measured at the countyyear level.
Our identification comes from two different sources of variation. First, the effect is
identified from differences in yield over time as GE adoption has increased, controlling for statespecific yield trends and weather. Second, the effect is identified from differences in yields from
10

the county-specific average - adjusted for the state-specific trend - between counties that had
different levels of GE adoption. Alternatively, we could include year fixed effects and our source
of identification would be the change in yields between counties with different changes in adoption
rates of GEs. We do not include year fixed effects because it precludes the use of pre-adoption
data as a counterfactual for post-adoption data and thus exploits a very narrow source of variation
in GE adoption.

State-Level Adoption Rates
One of the main concerns in identifying δ is that data on GE adoption are only available at the
state level, thus the variable that we observe is Ast . This can be cast as a non-classical measurement
error problem where the true unobserved measure Ait* is related to our observed measure Ast by
𝐴𝐴∗𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝐴𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 + 𝑣𝑣𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

where 𝑣𝑣𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 denotes the difference between the county-specific adoption and the state-level

aggregate adoption. Substituting this expression into the regression model and rearranging gives
𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛿𝛿𝐴𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 + 𝑓𝑓(𝐱𝐱 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , 𝛾𝛾) + 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖
𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛿𝛿𝑣𝑣𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 .

The error term uist is a composite random variable. Note that this source of measurement error is
non-classical in the sense that it does not induce bias in our estimate of δ because the measurement
error is uncorrelated with the observed state-level adoption. The state-level aggregate adoption in
each year is uncorrelated—by definition—with the deviation of a particular county’s adoption
from the state-level aggregate.
However, the measurement error does induce serial correlation of the error terms on a
subsample of the data. Some counties are likely to lead or lag the state-level adoption rate in all
11

periods of technology diffusion, resulting in serial correlation of the errors. Note that measurement
error is only a concern during the period of adoption when Ast ∈ (0,1) since Ait* and Ast are
necessarily both equal to zero prior to adoption and both equal to one at full adoption. Thus, the
measurement error induces serial correlation in the errors only when both periods are in the
adoption phase of the data.
We use the two-way clustering approach of Cameron, Gelbach, and Miller (2012) to
account for multiple sources of correlation in the errors. The first dimension of clustering is
accomplished by using a county-by-adoption-phase grouping scheme such that each county is split
into two groups, one when GE adoption equals zero and another when adoption is positive. This
clustering accounts for potential serial correlation resulting from the measurement error of the
state-level adoption variable. The second dimension of clustering is by year in order to account for
the presence of spatial correlation in the errors ( ε ist ) driven by the spatial similarity of residual
weather shocks not accounted for in the model across counties within each year. We interpret this
approach as being robust to heteroscedasticity, spatial correlation of the error terms across
counties, and serial correlation of the errors within each county both within and outside of the
adoption period.

Importance of Controlling for Weather
It is worth noting that the need to control for weather is important if the exposure differs between
the pre- and post-GE subsamples in the data (or if weather was relatively good or bad in counties
that adopted more rapidly). In theory, if one were to observe a large enough frequency of weather
outcomes in both periods such that average weather exposures were similar, then one would not
need to control for its influence. In practice, weather may bias coefficients in samples where the
12

number of time periods is not large. We investigate this possibility by comparing precipitation and
extreme heat exposure (degree days above 29°C) in both periods, i.e. pre and post 1996. For each
county, we calculate the percentage difference in the average precipitation and extreme heat
variables across periods and report these values in Figures S5 and S6. Precipitation was roughly 4
percent higher in the post-GE period on average across counties. However, this masks a large
amount of heterogeneity as county-level differences ranged from -15 to 21 percent. Similarly, the
occurrence of extreme heat exhibited a large amount of heterogeneity as differences as large as 63 and 22 percent spanned an average value of -20 percent. This suggests that controlling for
weather is important, and must be done at a local level. It would not likely be properly accounted
for using spatially aggregated measures of weather shocks at the regional or national level, nor
using crude measures such as year fixed effects.

Heterogeneous Yield Response
We also consider models of the form

yist =
α + δ g Ast + f (xist , γ ) + uist
where we are now allowing the parameter of interest δ to vary across different subsections of the
data represented by groupings g. We interact the GE adoption variable with the weather variables
that are a subset of the variables in xist to investigate whether GE varieties are more or less
susceptible to certain weather outcomes. We also consider several models of cross-sectional
heterogeneity, each based on a different assignment of the county to a group. The first utilizes a
grouping based on the state each county is in, while the other two assign each county to a group
based on measures of soil quality. The first measure of soil quality defines groups based on the
percentiles of the observed water holding capacity variable: 0-10th, 10th-25th, 25th-50th, 50th-75th,

13

75th-90th, and 90th-100th. The second defines groups based on the dominant soil texture in each
county.

Results
We report estimates for three classes of models in this section. The first section provides estimates
for a class of models that assume a homogeneous GE effect across counties. The second class of
models maintains this homogeneity assumption but reports estimates for models of the higher order
moments of the corn yield distribution. The final class of models relaxes the homogeneity
assumption and allows the GE effect to vary across weather outcomes and county groupings. All
models are estimated using OLS with standard errors clustered using the two-way approach
discussed above.

Homogeneous GE Effect
Table 1 reports parameter estimates for five models that sequentially include additional control
variables. In the absence of any controls, the estimated GE effect is 43 bushels per acre. However,
it is clear that this estimate is confounded by the absence of a trend variable which, when included,
changes the estimate to -8 bushels per acre. This sensitivity is expected as the increase in GE
adoption has coincided with many other production innovations that have increased productivity
over time. Failure to account for this source of variation in the data confounds the estimate. The
next model adds county fixed effects to the model, and the estimate becomes positive but is not
statistically significantly different from zero at conventional levels. In addition, the estimate of the
time trend parameter is also sensitive to the inclusion of these fixed effects as it decreases from 2
to 1.5 bushels per acre per year. It is clear that controlling for county-specific time-invariant yield

Notes: The reported coefficient estimate for the time trend variable under model 5 is the simple average of the statespecific estimates. The out-of-sample prediction comparison reports the percentage reduction in the root-meansquared prediction error (RMSE) for each model compared to the baseline model 1 that does not include any control
variables. Each model is estimated 1,000 times, where each iteration randomly selects 80 percent of the sample
observations. Relative performance is measured according to the accuracy of each model’s prediction for the
omitted 20 percent of the data. Two-way clustered standard errors by year and county-adoption are reported in
square brackets. *, **, and *** denote statistical significance at the 10, 5, and 1 percent levels.

drivers such as soil quality is an important consideration for estimating productivity gains. The
next model includes the precipitation and weather variables, and again we see a sensitivity of the
estimates as the GE effect increases and becomes statistically significant at the 1 percent level.
Note that adding the weather variables nearly triples the estimate of the GE effect and reduces the
standard error by half. Adding the weather variables also reduces the trend coefficient to 1 bushel

15

per acre per year, implying that the trend increase in yield was much smaller before the
introduction of GE varieties after we account for weather conditions.
The final model allows the time trend parameters to vary across states and we find that the
GE estimate has stabilized across this additional generalization. Both the in-sample fit and the outof-sample prediction accuracy of the models steadily increases as we include additional control
variables in the model. Further supporting this finding that control variables matter, we reject the
null of equality for the state-specific trend estimates (p-value 0.000) and reject the null that the
weather variable estimates are jointly zero (p-value 0.000). Thus, under an assumption of a
homogenous GE effect, we find that the introduction of GE corn has increased yields by
approximately 18 bushels per acre. This represents a roughly 17 percent increase in yields relative
to the five-year average yield prior to the introduction of GE traits.

Higher Order Moment Effects of GE
We next consider whether GE adoption has influenced the higher order moments of the corn yield
distribution using a moments-model approach (Antle 1983, 2010; Just and Pope, 1978).
Specifically, we estimate both the variance and skewness of the yield distribution using the squared
and cubed residuals from the preferred model from the previous section (Table 1, model 5). These
transformed residuals are then regressed on the same set of covariates as the preferred model.
Under expectation of the dependent variable, these models provide linkages between the GE
adoption and control variables on the variance and skewness of the yield distribution.
The parameter estimates for these models are reported in Table S2. We find no evidence
that GE adoption has affected the variance or skewness of the yield distribution as the estimates
are not statistically significant at standard levels. However, taken in conjunction with the results

16

revealing increases in mean yields, our results suggest that GE adoption has led to a reduction in
yield risk as it has increased yields without a proportionate increase in the standard deviation; that
is, the coefficient of variation has decreased. Importantly, the estimate for the time trend variable
implies an increase in yield variance over time, suggesting that it is an important control variable
for studies to consider when estimating yield risk implications of GE. Although not reported here,
when the time trends are dropped from the model, the estimate of the GE effect on yield variance
becomes positive and significant at the 10 percent level (p-value 0.096).

Heterogeneous GE Effect
Results for joint hypothesis tests for the heterogeneous models are reported in Table S3, where the
p-values correspond to a null hypothesis of a homogenous GE effect. The first three models explore
interactions between the weather variables and GE adoption. We find no evidence of these
interactions for precipitation alone, temperature alone, nor precipitation and temperature
combined. Thus we conclude that, while ignoring weather severely biases the estimated effect of
GE corn adoption, the performance of GE varieties is not likely dependent on particular weather
outcomes occurring. One reason for this result is that the initial GE traits focused on insect
resistance and herbicide tolerance, rather than developing traits to improve drought or heat
tolerance. In the future, GE traits may focus more on drought and heat so that our result may not
continue to hold (Marshall, 2014).
The next set of heterogeneity models that we consider assign each county to a particular
group. We first use state boundaries to define the grouping and estimate the heterogeneous effects
by interacting dummy variables for each state with the GE adoption variable. We fail to reject the
null of a homogeneous effect at standard significance levels (p-value = 0.1117), however Figure

17

S9 provides a spatial map of these estimates and suggests that there are potentially large differences
in effects across regions. A simple average of the estimates is 19.1 and they range from 5.5 to 27.5
bushels per acre.
To further explore potential spatial heterogeneities, we assign each county to one of six
groups based on the soil’s water holding capacity. The groups correspond to different percentiles
of the empirical distribution of observed values (1: 0-10th percentile, 2: 10-25th percentile, 3: 2550th percentile, 4: 50-75th percentile, 5: 75-90th percentile, and 6: 90-100th percentile). We interact
dummy variables for each group with the GE adoption variable, and we find evidence that this
pattern of spatial heterogeneity is supported by the data as a joint hypothesis test suggests rejecting
the null of a homogeneous effect at standard significance levels (p-value = 0.0000). The parameter
estimates are reported in Table S4 and Figure 2 provides a spatial map of the impacts by county.
The county-level estimates have an average value of 18.4 and they range from 12.5 to 25.1 bushels
per acre. It is clear from the map that there exists substantial within-state variation of the GE effect
that the state-specific heterogeneity model is not capable of capturing. Figure S10 plots the range
of county-level GE effects within each state along with the average value within that state, and
shows that there exists a broad range of over 10 bushels per acre within most states. This insight
is consistent with the state-specific model’s failure to reject the null of a homogeneous effect, as
the spatial heterogeneities are not being driven by ad hoc political boundaries but rather the
localized growing conditions.

Figure 2. Impacts of GE Corn Adoption (bushels per acre) by Counties’ Soil Water Holding
Capacities. Each county is assigned to one of six groups based on the soil’s water holding capacity, and a
separate GE impact is estimated for each group. Estimated impacts are then binned according to values in
the figure legend.

The final model that we consider further supports this insight and suggests that soil texture
is also an important dimension for understanding heterogeneous GE effects. We assign each
county to one of nine groups based on the dominant soil texture: clay, clay-loam, loam, loamysand, sand, sandy-loam, silt-loam, silty-clay, silty-clay-loam. We interact dummy variables for
each group with the GE adoption variable and we find evidence that this pattern of spatial
heterogeneity is supported by the data as a joint hypothesis test suggests rejecting the null of a
19

homogeneous effect at standard significance levels (p-value = 0.0001). The parameter estimates
are reported in Table S4 and Figure 3 provides a spatial map of the impacts by county. The countylevel estimates have an average value of 18.3 and they range from 3.9 to 24.0 bushels per acre. We
again find that there exists substantial within-state variation of the GE effect that the state-specific
heterogeneity model is not capable of capturing as shown in Figure S10.

assigned to one of nine groups based on the soil’s texture, and a separate GE impact is estimated for each
group. Estimated impacts are then binned according to values in the figure legend.

The location of greater yield impacts from GE adoption corresponds generally with the
location of greater utilization of Bt traits (see Hutchison et al. 2010). As mentioned earlier in the
paper, research from experimental plots has generally found greater yield benefits from Bt traits
than herbicide resistant traits. There are a couple reasons why soil characteristics might be driving
greater adoption of Bt traits. First, corn borer and corn rootworm pressures are affected by soil
characteristics (e.g., Beck and Apple, 1961; Huber, Neiswander, and Salter, 1928; Turpin and
Peters, 1971; MacDonald and Ellis, 1990). Second, areas with better soil characteristics have a
greater concentration of corn production resulting in greater pest pressure.
Conclusion
There is considerable interest, both within the academic community and among the broader public,
in the effects of GE crop adoption. In particular, the effect of GE crop adoption on yield has been
the subject of much debate, perhaps because of relationships between yield and environmental
outcomes via land use and because of the implications for food security. Numerous experiments
have found that GE traits have tended to reduce the gap between actual and potential corn yields
(Fernadez-Cornejo et al., 2014; Klümper and Qaim, 2014; and NASEM, 2016); however,
experimental studies often generate significantly higher yields than farmers actually experience
(Lobell et al., 2009). Moreover, aggregate yield trends in the US appear, at first blush, relatively
stable before and after adoption of GE corn.
This paper sought to identify whether, in fact, for corn “the nation-wide data . . . in the
United States do not show a significant signature of genetic-engineering technology on the rate of
yield increase,” as was indicated by NASEM (2016). Using corn yield panel data corresponding
to roughly 28,000 U.S. county-years before and after adoption of GE corn, a simple model only
including a time trend confirms NASEM’s assertion, as the effect of GE adoption appears, if
21

anything, to have had a negative effect on yields. However, subsequent analysis reveals this simple
model is biased. After controlling for weather and soil characteristics, and assuming a
homogeneous effect of adoption, we find that adoption of GE corn has led to an approximate 17
percent increase in corn yields. We also find significant heterogeneity in the yield-effect that is not
related to state-boundaries but rather to soil characteristics. On average, adoption of GE corn has
led to an 18.5 bushel per acre increase in yield, but the effects range from 12.5 to 25.1 bushels per
acre depending on soil characteristics. We conjecture that the variation across soil types may be
related to differences in insect pressure.
While we found important soil-GE adoption interactions, there were no significant
interactions related to weather. The findings suggest that the current GE traits have not led to more
resilience to heat or water stresses. Moreover, while we find that the variance in corn yield has
increased over time, adoption of GE corn has not lowered the variance. Nonetheless, if as our
results show, adoption of GE corn increases yield without affecting variance, the coefficient of
variation on yields has fallen as a result of GE corn adoption. This suggests GE corn is less risky
as, for example, the actuarially fair price of insurance to indemnify a given yield falls as the
coefficient of variation falls.
Our study has a number of limitations. As we discussed, the available adoption data only
exists at the state level. We showed that this produces a type of measurement error problem that
can lead to serially-correlated errors – an issue we address using the two-way clustering approach
of Cameron, Gelbach, and Miller (2012). There are other issues that have likely affected nationallevel yields, such as the move toward more continuous corn and other factors that have led to the
expansion of corn acres. We partially addressed this problem by limiting our analysis to only those
counties that reported yield data for at least two-thirds of the years before and after GE adoption,

22

but an altogether different sort of analysis that moves from our primal production function
approach to a structural model that relates planting decisions to input and output prices would
likely be required to fully address the issue. It would also be of interest to conduct the sort of
analysis performed here using data, for example, from the European Union, where there has been
little to no adoption of GE corn. Such an approach would permit a truer difference-in-difference
estimate of the effect of GE corn adoption.
A final important caveat to be noted is that the estimated effects of GE corn adoption
depend critically on the available GE technologies. Genetic engineering is not a single “thing.” In
the case of our data, GE corn is one of four types: herbicide tolerant, Bt corn-borer tolerant, Bt
root-worm tolerant, or stacked varieties that include combinations of the previous three types.
Geneticists and plant scientists are continually working on new genetic modifications that could
further reduce the gap between actual and potential yield or even increase potential yields. For
example, Kromdijk et al. (2016) recently genetically engineered a tobacco plant to improve the
efficiency of photosynthesis, which increased potential yields by about 20%. Other research has
focused on genetic pathways to increasing nitrogen utilization (McAllister et al., 2012). Whether
these additional GE crop technologies can live up to the “hype” of increasing crop yields remains
to be seen. However, if and when these biotechnologies arrive, it will be important to closely
scrutinize whether they substantively affect real-world farm yields, just as this study has attempted
to do with the first generations of GE corn.

Notes: Both models include a full set of controls: weather variables, county fixed effects, and statespecific linear trends. The out-of-sample prediction comparison reports the percentage reduction in
the root-mean-squared prediction error (RMSE) for each model compared to a baseline model that
does not include any control variables and assumes a homogeneous GE effect. Each model is
estimated 1,000 times, where each iteration randomly selects 80 percent of the sample observations.
Relative performance is measured according to the accuracy of each model’s prediction for the
omitted 20 percent of the data. Two-way clustered standard errors by year and county-adoption are
reported in square brackets. *, **, and *** denote statistical significance at the 10, 5, and 1 percent
levels.

Figure S1. Spatial and temporal variation of yields. We observe yields at the county-year level,
and construct boxplots for each year. Each box is defined by the upper and lower quartile, with the
median depicted as a horizontal line within the box. The endpoints for the whiskers are the upper
and lower adjacent values, which are defined as the relevant quartile +/- three-halves of the
interquartile range, and circles represent data points outside of the adjacent values.

Figure S2. Observed and interpolated values for state-level GE adoption rates. The dots
represented observed data, and the lines denote interpolated (predicted) values for the rates using
two different. We interpolate missing data using predictions from a generalized linear model with
a binomial family and a logit link function. The “prediction pooled” model pools all states and
includes state fixed effects, while the “prediction state” model estimates a separate model for each
state.
