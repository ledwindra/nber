Life-Cycle Consumption and the Age-Adjusted Value of Life

ABSTRACT
Our research examines empirically the age pattern of the implicit value of life revealed from
workers' differential wages and job safety pairings. Although aging reduces the number of years of
life expectancy, aging can affect the value of life through an effect on planned life-cycle
consumption. The elderly could, a priori, have the highest implicit value of life if there is a life-cycle
plan to defer consumption until old age. We find that largely due to the age pattern of consumption,
which is non-constant, the implicit value of life rises and falls over the lifetime in a way that the
value for the elderly is higher than the average over all ages or for the young. There are important
policy implications of our empirical results. Because there may be age-specific benefits of programs
to save statistical lives, instead of valuing the lives of the elderly at less than the young,
policymakers should more correctly value the lives of the elderly at as much as twice the young
because of relatively greater consumption lost when accidental death occurs.

1. Introduction
How the value of life varies over the life cycle has long been of substantial
theoretical interest. Although the quantity of one’s future expected lifetime diminishes
with age the resources one can allocate toward reducing fatality risks change as well.
Except in models based on highly restrictive assumptions, the value of life does not peak
at birth and steadily decline, as would be the case based solely on one’s expected future
lifetime. Perhaps the principal insight of the life-cycle models is that the value of life at
any given age is highly dependent on the lifetime pattern of consumption. Here we
examine empirically how the shape of the age-related value of life trajectory is governed
largely by the life-cycle consumption relationship.
Despite the strong theoretical linkage between the value of life and consumption,
no study of implicit values of life revealed by market decisions has included consumption
in the empirical framework. Hedonic studies using labor market or product market risks
have abstracted completely from the theoretical dependency of the value of life over the
life cycle and the life-cycle pattern of consumption, creating a potential source of bias.
The discrepancies between the estimated and actual values of life may be especially acute
for examining how the value of life varies with age rather than for estimates focusing on
average estimates for a sample. Perhaps because they ignore consumption, hedonic labor
market studies of age variations in the value of life generally yield the implausible result
that the value of life turns negative at some age before retirement. 1 Explicitly including
consumption in stated preference assessments of the value of life by age does not arise as
1

For example, the value of life becomes negative at age 42 for the results in Thaler and Rosen (1975) and
at 48 for the estimate in Viscusi (1979). Viscusi and Aldy (2003) provide a comprehensive review of value
of life studies, all of which imply a negative value of life by age 60. An interesting exception is the recent
research of Smith, et al. (2004), who found that the oldest workers in their Health and Retirement Study
sample received significantly higher compensation for fatality risks posed by their jobs.

an issue because the survey values are elicited directly, not imputed based on market
tradeoffs. Our research provides the first consumption-dependent estimates of the value
of life using hedonic labor-market data.
Reliable estimates of age-related variations in the value of life are of theoretical
and policy interest. The empirical shape of the life-cycle patterns of consumption and the
value of life not only provide a test of the life-cycle models of the value of life but also
provide evidence indicative of the particular theoretical regime that is pertinent.
Imperfect markets models and perfect markets models yield quite different estimates of
the time path of the value of life. 2 Models in which there are imperfect markets imply an
inverted U-shaped relationship between the value of life and age, while perfect markets
models imply a steadily declining value of life with age. Theoretical models also yield
predictions of life-cycle consumption patterns, which are the foundation of our study
because the value of life is derived by decreasing the individual’s hazard rate within the
context of a life-cycle consumption model. On an empirical basis, the observed
relationship between consumption and age is more consistent with the trajectory
embodied in the imperfect markets case than the flat consumption profile in the perfect
markets models.
For policy purposes, there has been increasing interest in age adjustments to the
value of life for benefit assessment, as exemplified by the evaluation of the
Environmental Protection Agency’s Clear Skies initiative. Although U.S. government
agencies routinely use market-based estimates for the value of life to assess the risk
reduction benefits of regulations, available market data are not instructive in making age
adjustments because the estimated values of life are often negative. A consequence is that

policy evaluations have sometimes coupled market estimates of the overall value of life
with survey estimates of how the values should vary with individual age. The results
presented here will provide more meaningful estimates of the age variation in the value of
life using market data, thus putting the baseline value of life and the age variation on
comparable terms.
In what follows we begin with the canonical theoretical and empirical
specification of a hedonic wage function for fatal work-related injury risk. Even in the
canonical specification the implicit value of life can vary with age through an aging effect
on the wage. We then consider an enriched specification of wage hedonics where the
individual’s market wage function reflects that the willingness of a worker to accept risk
may depend on the planned life-cycle path of consumption, which will be another avenue
for age differences in the value of life. The importance of the consumption channel for
aging effects is that the value of life can be constant, increasing, decreasing, or nonmonotonic with age depending on the age profile of consumption. Our empirical results
are consistent with a value of life that follows an inverted U shape. The age pattern of the
implicit value of life that we find is largely due to the importance of consumption in the
wage equation with the peak of the value of life occurring at about age 50. Our focal
result is robust to the measure of consumption and to controlling for industry and
endogeneity of consumption in the expanded hedonic wage equation we estimate. Our
finding that the estimated value of life for the elderly is higher than the average value of
life in the data and also higher than the value of life for the youngest workers in the data
is important for policy, which may use an age-dependent value of life that incorrectly
assumes a monotonic decline with age when valuing a program’s benefits.

2. How Consumption Influences the Value of Life
Most models of labor market tradeoffs regarding the value of statistical life are
single-period. Let the utility associated with bequests be zero, the wage be w, the
probability of not being killed on the job be π, and the utility function when healthy be
V(w), which has the usual shape where Vw > 0 and Vww ≤ 0. A worker selecting from a
market opportunities locus in which the wage is a positive but diminishing function of the
fatality risk will select a wage-risk tradeoff, or an implicit value of life, that is equal to
V(w)/(1 − π)Vw, because all wages in any period are consumed. 3 Because von NeumannMorgenstern utility functions are unaffected by positive linear transformations, division
by the expected marginal utility of income normalizes the value of life in marginal utility
units, eliminating any effect of the scale of the utility function.
If workers’ risky job decisions were just a sequence of single-period choices
dependence of the value of life on consumption would be quite simple. The estimated
value of life would track the consumption pattern over time, which rises and then later
falls over the life cycle. High levels of consumption for more experienced workers will
raise the numerator of the value of life given by the wage-risk tradeoff, and the high
consumption levels will also lead to lower marginal utility of income. Thus, for any given
level of job risk, both of the life-cycle consumption influences boost the implicit value of
life, at least during the middle age years of high consumption, and the value of life will
not be a steadily declining function of age.
The substantial theoretical literature on the value of life over the life cycle has
utilized models of optimal consumption decisions over time. Within the context of life-

cycle consumption frameworks, what is the value of the individual’s willingness to pay
for a reduction in the hazard rate, and how does the value vary with age? Although
models differ considerably in their overall structure and their predictions regarding the
shape of the value of life-age relationship, they all share a common recognition that the
value of life is a function of consumption, the rate of discount, various probabilistic
terms, and, in some models, the worker’s wage rate.
It is instructive to consider the results in an early contribution by Shepard and
Zeckhauser (1984), which provides approximations of the value of life, as well as the
model by Johansson (2002a, 2002b), who provides exact estimates. 4 Each model
considers the willingness to pay for temporary reductions in the hazard rate within the
context of life-cycle consumption models for two extreme cases: no insurance available
and perfect annuities markets. With perfect markets the model implies invariant
consumption levels over the life cycle, whereas if there is no annuity insurance
consumption will display an inverted U-shape pattern. 5 Thus, the first role of our
examination of empirical consumption patterns is to provide information on which
insurance market regime is pertinent. As is well documented in the literature and will be
shown to be the case below, the age profile of consumption rises then falls over the life
cycle. Our empirical results are consistent with the types of consumption patterns that
have been derived in life-cycle model simulations for the no annuity insurance case and
are inconsistent with the consumption predictions of the perfect insurance models.
The second general role of consumption is that for either the no annuities model
or perfect markets case, the willingness to pay for small changes in risk (the value of a

statistical life) is highly dependent on consumption levels. Consider the results for the
discrete time case from Johansson (2002b). 6 For the no insurance case the value of
statistical life VSL for a person age τ years is given by
VSLt =

where t is the age counter, T is the maximum age, r is the rate of interest, π t is the
conditional survival probability to year t having reached age τ , V(ct) is the utility of
consumption in year t, and Vc is the current period marginal utility of consumption.
Consumption also enters in models when insurance markets are perfect, though as
noted above, such models yield predictions that are inconsistent with consumption
patterns. The counterpart expression for VSLτ in equation (1) will include an additional
term equal to the present value of the expected difference between the worker’s wages
and consumption, which some have labeled the excess of wages over consumption. Then
the value of life is given by
VSLt =

(2)

For both the no insurance and the perfect insurance cases there is a strong dependency of
VSL on consumption entering via the supply side of the labor market.
Studies of the dependence of the value of life on age have generally relied on
numerical simulations for specific classes of models. The imperfect markets simulation
by Shepard and Zeckhauser (1984) indicated that the value of life rises then falls over the
life cycle. With perfect markets, the value of life is a steadily decreasing function of age.
Using econometric estimates from Thaler and Rosen (1975) coupled with a life cycle

Shepard and Zeckhauser (1984).

model, Rosen’s (1988) simulation suggested a steadily decreasing value of life for the age
range he considered, 36 to 48.
The failure to develop a clear-cut relationship between the value of life and age
may in part have fostered the continuing economic debate over the shape of the
relationship. Whether the value of life rises or falls with age cannot be determined
conclusively on a theoretical level. Johansson (2002a) has shown that the age-VSL
relationship is indeterminate in general. However, it is also clear that consumption levels
are the driving force of age-related variations, and no previous empirical research has
considered the dependency of the value of life on consumption.
3. Econometric Framework
To resolve the nature of the consumption-age-VSL relationship, our empirical
research begins by estimating the canonical hedonic wage equation used in the value of
statistical life literature augmented with household consumption expenditures. The
economic interpretation of the consumption-augmented wage equation is as a conditional
on consumption hedonic equilibrium. As noted first by Pollak (1969) and more recently
by Browning and Meghir (1991) a conditional model is a parsimonious way to relax
separability and yet maintain focus on the primary outcome of interest. The implication is
that rather than the typical unconditional results found in the wage-fatality tradeoff
literature the interpretation here is of the effect of a change in fatal job risk on wages,
conditional on the quantity of consumption.
For worker i (i = 1,…,N) in industry j (j = 1,…,J) and occupation k (k = 1,…,K)
the hedonic tradeoff between the wage and risk of fatality including consumption is

ln wijk = α fatal jk + δ Ci + X ijk γ + uijk ,

8

(3)

where lnwijk is the natural log of the hourly wage rate, fataljk is the industry and
occupation specific fatality rate, Ci is the household expenditure level, Xijk is a vector
containing a set of dummy variables for the worker’s one-digit occupation (and industry
in some specifications) and region of residence plus the usual demographic variables
pertaining to worker education, race, marital status, and union status. Finally, uijk is an
error term that admits conditional heteroskedasticity and within fatality risk
autocorrelation.
We begin with the maintained hypothesis that E[uijk | fatal jk , X ijk ] = 0 , which is
the standard zero conditional mean assumption used in least squares regression. Because
consumption is a choice variable we expect that E[uijk Ci ] ≠ 0 ; not only is the zero
conditional mean assumption likely violated, but so too is the weaker zero correlation
assumption because of the endogeneity of consumption. We need an instrumental
variables estimator to estimate the model’s parameters consistently. Selecting an
instrument is always a challenge in IV models, but in our case we can rely on standard
results from the theory of the consumer. Specifically, based on human capital theory we
take nonlabor income as having no direct effect on the log wage, but from static models
of consumption and labor supply we take nonlabor income as helping determine
consumption. 7 In other words, if Vi is nonlabor income, then we use for identification the
assumptions that E[uijkVi | Ci ] = 0 and that E[CiVi ] ≠ 0 . Although the conditional
7

To elaborate, there is no contemporaneous correlation between the wage and nonlabor income produced
by construction because nonlabor income is the difference between total family income and family labor
market income. Although past earnings contribute to current saving, nonlabor income is not, a priori, a
determinant of the current labor market equilibrium wage. Interest earnings could be high or low due to a
high or low return on financial capital investment, which does not directly determine the market
equilibrium wage. The hedonic wage equation in (3) is an equilibrium equation and, as such, is dynamically
complete by construction. Conditional on consumption, nonlabor income has no effect on the equilibrium
wage except through the supply side of the labor market via worker consumption. See Heckman, Lochner
and Todd (2005) for more extensive discussion of estimating wage (Mincer) equations with endogeneity.

9

exogeneity of nonlabor income is not testable, the needed covariation of consumption
with nonlabor income is testable via the first-stage regression of Ci on Vi and the other
exogenous variables in the model.
Accounting for the fact that fatality risk is per 100,000 workers and that the
typical work-year is about 2000 hours, the estimated value of a statistical life is

where exp(•) is the exponential function and (ln w) is the predicted log wage from the
regression model in (3). The VSL function in (4) can be evaluated at various points in the
wage distribution, but most commonly researchers report the mean effect. 8 In the
standard framework δ ≡ 0 in (3) so that age affects VSL only through its direct effect on
the wage. When we allow for δ ≠ 0 in (3), changes in the fatality risk implicitly affect
both the wage and consumption levels. Thus, age affects VSL through both a direct effect
on the wage and an indirect effect through consumption (which affects the wage and is
itself age-dependent). We not only report a distribution of value of statistical life
estimates, but also graphically illustrate the fitted value of life profile over the life cycle.
4. Data and Sample Description

We use two data sources for our research. The first is the 1997 wave of the Panel
Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), which provides individual-level data on wages,
consumption, industry and occupation, and demographics. The PSID survey has followed
a core set of households since 1968 plus newly formed households as members of the

8

10

original core have split off into new families. The sample we use consists of male heads
of household between the ages of 18 and 65 who (i) are in the random Survey Research
Center (SRC) portion of the PSID, excludes the oversample of the poor in the Survey of
Economic Opportunity (SEO) as well as the Latino sub-sample, (ii) worked for hourly or
salary pay at some point in the previous calendar year, (iii) are not a student, permanently
disabled, or institutionalized, (iv) have an hourly wage greater than $2 per hour and less
than $100 per hour, (v) have annual food expenditures of at least $520 and combined
food and housing expenditures less than $100,000, and (vi) have no missing data on
wages, consumption, education, industry, and occupation. After sample filter (i) there are
2,872 men in the sample, while imposing filters (ii)–(vi) eliminates 997 men so that our
final sample size is 1,875.
The focal variables in our models are the hourly wage rate, consumption
expenditures, and demographics. For workers paid by the hour the survey records the
gross hourly wage rate. The interviewer asks salaried workers how frequently they are
paid, such as weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly. The interviewer then norms a salaried
worker's pay by a fixed number of hours worked depending on the pay period. For
example, salary divided by 40 is the hourly wage rate constructed for a salaried worker
paid weekly. We then take the natural log of the wage rate to minimize the influence of
outliers and to aid in interpreting the model parameters.
A limitation of the PSID relative to the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CE) is the
scope of consumption data. The PSID only records on a regular basis food expenditures
(including food stamps) on food eaten inside and outside the household, as well as
housing expenditures for renters and homeowners with mortgage payments. We consider

11

two measures of consumption, combined food and housing expenditures and total
consumption. The total consumption measure uses an imputation method found in Ziliak
(1998). Specifically, he shows that given an estimate of saving, Sˆi , one can derive an
estimate of total consumption as the residual of disposable income and saving,
Cˆ i = Yi − Sˆi . 9 Here we estimate saving as Sˆi = 17,915(0.8169 /1.019) + 0.599 Ai , where the

inflation adjustment factor on the constant term places the estimate in 1997 dollars and
Ai is liquid assets defined as the capitalized value of rent, interest, and dividend
income. 10 For models based on predicted total consumption we impose the additional
sample selection filter that Cˆ i > $1000 , which reduces the sample to 1,596 men.
Although the quality of wage data and demographic information in the PSID strongly
dominates that found in the CE, we recognize that our consumption data are less than
ideal. It is hoped that using two separate measures of consumption will offer added
robustness. Appendix Table 1 provides the sample average and quartile values for
consumption. 11
The demographic controls in the model include years of formal education, a
quadratic in age, dummy indicators for region of country (northeast, north central, and
west with south the omitted region), race (white = 1), union status (coverage = 1), marital
status (married = 1), and one-digit industry and occupation.

Note that Y contains wage income, which is an additional reason to instrument consumption in the
hedonic wage equation.
10
Browning Crossley, and Weber (2003) argue that such imputation methods are a fruitful approach to deal
with limited consumption data.
11
It is instructive to note how our estimate of total expenditures aligns with estimates from the CE. Meyer
and Sullivan (2003, Table 2) estimate total expenditures for all families with heads 21–62 years of age at
the 30th percentile to be $20,314 and at the 50th percentile to be $28,217. Our estimates of total expenditure
in Appendix Table 1 are $19,876 at the 25th percentile and $35,734 at the 50th percentile. Our estimates will
exceed Meyer and Sullivan’s because we restrict our sample to working prime-age men.

The fatality risk measure here is the fatality rate for the worker’s industryoccupation group. Because published fatality risk measures are available only by
industry, we constructed a worker fatality risk variable using unpublished U.S. Bureau of
Labor Statistics data from the Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries (CFOI). 12 The CFOI
provides the most comprehensive inventory of all work-related fatalities. The CFOI data
come from reports by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, workers’
compensation reports, death certificates, and medical examiner reports. In each case there
is a records examination determining that the fatality was in fact a job-related incident.
The number of fatalities in each industry-occupation cell is the numerator of the fatality
risk measure.
The denominator used to construct the fatality risk is the number of employees for
that industry-occupation group. 13 Workers in agriculture and in the armed forces are
excluded. Because there is less reporting error in the worker industry information than in
worker occupation information, our formulation should lead to less measurement error
than if the worker’s occupation were the primary basis for the matching. 14 We have 720
industry-occupation groups using a breakdown of 72 two-digit SIC code industries and
the 10 one-digit occupational groups. With 6,238 total work-related deaths in 1997, our
procedure created 290 industry-occupation cells with no reported fatalities.
Because the total number of fatalities was quite stable from 1992 (the first year of
the CFOI data) through our sample year 1997, we used the average annual number of

12

The fatality data are available on CD-ROM from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The procedure used
to construct fatality risk follows Viscusi (2004), who compares fatality risk to other death risk variables.
13
For the estimate we used the 1997 annual employment averages from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics,
Current Population Survey, (unpublished) Table 6, Employed Persons by Detailed Industry and
Occupation. For 13 of the 720 categories there was no reported employment for the cell.

13

fatalities for a cell during 1992–1997 when calculating the fatality risk. 15 The
intertemporal stability of total fatalities means that the averaging process will reduce the
influence of random fluctuations in fatalities as well as the small sample problems that
arise with respect to many narrowly defined job categories. Using the average fatality rate
from 1992–1997 reduces the total number of industry-occupation cells with no fatalities
to 90 and also makes the fatality risk measure less subject to random events.
The mean fatality risk for the sample is 4/100,000. The range of risk levels by
occupation goes from 0.6/100,000 for administrative support occupations, including
clerical, to 23.5/100,000 for transportation and material moving occupations. The riskiest
industry was mining, with a fatality risk of 24.6/100,000.
5. Wage Equation Estimates

As indicated in (3), the basic regression equation we estimate is a semi-log
equation where the worker’s wage is regressed on a series of personal characteristics, job
characteristics, the fatality risk for the worker’s industry-occupation cell, and
consumption. Our regressions explore two different series of specifications. One set does
not include control variables for the worker’s industry and another parallel set of
regressions includes dummy variables for one-digit industry.
Inclusion of industry control variables potentially can capture omitted industryspecific differences with respect to job characteristics and market offer curves. However,
here a difficulty arises because the fatality risk variable uses the worker’s industry as the
basis for the matching. Including industry variables will then partly be inducing
multicollinearity with respect to the fatality risk variable. There has been extensive

15

For example, in 1992 the total number of fatalities was 6,217, as compared to 6,238 in 1997.

14

discussion of the use of industry control variables within the context of compensating
differentials research. The consensus is that if the risk variable is constructed based on
the worker’s reported industry then including detailed industry controls tends to mask the
influence of compensating wage differentials for risk rather than reflecting inter-industry
wage differentials that may arise apart from risk-related considerations. 16
Tables 1 and 2 report the main coefficients of interest; the standard errors
corrected for conditional heteroskedasticity and for clustering based on the fatality risk
variable. Consider first the results in each table that do not include consumption and are
the most comparable to results found in the literature. Worker wages increase with age,
although there is a negative age squared effect in the baseline estimates. Using the
regression coefficients in Table 1, the direct effect of worker age is to increase worker
wages until age 49 after which there is a negative influence of age on wages. For the base
case excluding the industry controls, there is evidence of a statistically significant
compensating differential for fatality risk, whereas the fatality risk variable is not
statistically significant for the base case including industry controls in Table 2.
The next set of four equations in each table adds consumption-related variables,
first through ordinary least squares and then using an instrumental variables estimate for
the consumption effect. We record the results of the first-stage consumption regressions
with and without industry controls for our two consumption measures in Appendix Table
2. There is a strong nonlinear effect of age on the level of consumption. Critical for
identification, nonlabor income is an excellent predictor of consumption in all
specifications; the first-stage R2 is about 0.30, and the corresponding F-test is about 29
with a P-value of 0.0000 in each model.
16

For a detailed review of the studies pertaining to this issue, see Section 1 of Viscusi and Aldy (2003).

15

The coefficient of the food and housing consumption variable in the second and
third columns of Tables 1 and 2 is always strongly statistically significant, with
coefficients that are somewhat larger in the instrumental variables estimates than in the
ordinary least squares estimates. The coefficients of total consumption reported in the
final two columns of Tables 1 and 2 also have positive signs, where the effects are
somewhat larger for the OLS results than for the instrumental variables results. In each
instance the IV total consumption coefficient is not statistically significant at the 95
percent level in Table 2.
Including consumption has a much smaller influence on the fatality risk
coefficient for the Table 1 estimates than for the Table 2 estimates. Fatality risk
coefficients range from 0.0061 to 0.0071 for all five specifications in Table 1. In Table 2,
including consumption increases the magnitude of the fatality risk coefficient. In the case
of the food and housing consumption variable, adding consumption as a regressor in the
wage equation boosts the significance of the fatality risk coefficient so that it becomes
statistically significant and at least double the size of its standard error.
Taking the results of the estimation in conjunction with the characteristics of each
individual worker in the sample we use (4) to calculate a distribution of the value of life
estimates implied by our regression results. The average of the individual values of life in
the base case is $20.9 million for the Table 1 results (without industry controls) and $8.9
million for the Table 2 results (with industry controls). Although the implied values of
life estimates may appear to be high, such results may be a consequence of the particular
mix of workers represented in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. For example, using
different years and different sample selections, Garen (1988) found estimates of the

16

implicit value of life of $17.3 million using the PSID, while Moore and Viscusi (1990)
generated estimates of $20.8 million using the PSID.
Table 3 presents the implied values of life for the different specifications, making
it possible to see the effect of recognizing the influence of consumption on the estimated
value of life, as well as the influence of industry controls. Remember that all the
estimates in Table 3 that are based on regressions without industry controls have
underlying them a statistically significant fatality risk coefficient (see Table 1). The four
sets of results for the consumption-adjusted value of life from the regressions without
industry controls range from $21.7 million to $24.1 million on average. The only
estimates in Table 3 based on regressions with industry controls that also have
statistically significant estimates for the fatality risk variable use the food and housing
consumption regressor (see Table 2). The implicit value of life is $14.8 million, on
average, from the OLS regression including food and housing consumption and industry
controls; the implicit value of life is $20.3 million, on average, using instrumented food
and housing consumption.
Table 3 also reports the distribution of the values of life for the 25th percentile of
the value of life estimates, the 50th percentile, and the 75th percentile. Rather than
focusing on just the average of the value of life in the sample it is possible to examine the
heterogeneity of the values as well. There is, as one might expect, substantial variation in
the value of life estimates. Consider the results based on the IV estimates for food and
housing consumption. Between the 25th and 75th percentile the value of life increases
from $14.7 million to $28 million without industry controls and increases from $12.4
million to $23.5 million with industry controls.

6. Age Variations in the Value of Life

An interesting aspect of the heterogeneity of the value of life is the effect of
worker age. The estimates above only reflect the heterogeneity that arises because of
different worker risk levels and differences in worker wages, taking into account that the
overall equation generating the estimates also incorporated differences in individual
consumption. Estimates discussed up to now do not flesh out any systematic difference in
the fatality risk-wage tradeoff that might occur with age. Some studies have found age
variations in the fatality risk-wage tradeoff whereas others have not. In our case,
including an age-fatality risk interaction never yielded statistically significant interaction
effects (nor were consumption-fatality risk interactions significant). As a result, our
examination of the life-cycle variations in the value of life will focus on the effect of age
in terms of changes in risk levels, changes in wages over the life cycle, and the effect of
age on consumption based on the consumption-adjusted estimate of the value of life. 17
The role of life-cycle consumption is essential to inferring whether there is a
senior discount with respect to the value of life and, if so, how much of a senior discount
is there. Table 4 presents estimates of the implied value of life for different age ranges
within the sample where the comparisons are relative to the value of life for 18–21 year
olds. The results for the base case without industry controls are illustrative of the
following pattern. The value of life increases to a peak value at age 47–51 that is 2.53
times the value of life of 18–21 year olds. Then there is a tailing off of the value of life
relative to the 47–51 year olds for the most senior age group in the sample, which
consists of workers age 57–65. Even for the elderly the value of life is 2.12 times as great

17

The research of Aldy and Viscusi (2004), which does not consider consumption, finds an inverted Ushaped pattern for the relationship between VSL and age that is consistent with our estimates below.

18

as for 18–21 year olds. VSL for the oldest group is virtually identical to the relative value
of life for 37–41 year olds (2.13) and even greater than the estimated value of life for all
younger workers in the sample.
Below we consider a series of simulations that calculate the value of life for each
worker in the sample using the estimates from Tables 1 and 2 with the worker specific
values of the variables in equation (4). After generating a distribution of implied values
of life for all workers at each individual age in the sample, we then do a nonparametric
regression (using a cubic smoothing spline with about 180 observations per band) of the
variation in the value of life with age. The nonparametric estimates that appear in Figures
1–4 enable us to characterize the life-cycle distribution of the value of life and how the
distribution is affected by admitting consumption to the hedonic wage equation. 18
Figures 1a and 1b illustrate the age profiles of VSL for the (no consumption) base
case results without and with industry controls. The figures show a fairly steep rise in the
value of life until a peak at around age 51. The age profile of the implied value of life
based on OLS regression estimates including food and housing consumption in Figures
2a and 2b is considerably flatter than that shown for the no-consumption base case in
Figures 1a and 1b. Recognizing the role of life cycle consumption consequently mutes
the extent to which there is a life-cycle effect. The results in Figures 2a and 2b, as well as
in Figures 2c and 2d where food and housing consumption has been instrumented,
indicate that the value of life rises with age and declines somewhat. There is a flattening
of the value beyond age 51 that is less steep than the decline for the base case where
consumption is ignored.

18

Appendix Table 3 also summarizes the numerical values associated with the VSL distribution by age.

19

A third set of estimates that are depicted in Figures 3a–3d illustrate how the value
of life varies over the lifetime for models in which actual versus predicted total
consumption appears in the hedonic wage equation with and without industry controls.
The shift to using total consumption has two types of effects in the model with the most
econometric structure, the hedonic wage equation with industry controls and
instrumented total consumption. Note that the decline for seniors is relatively severe in
Figure 3c, more than elsewhere, so our subsequent illustrative example is conservative in
terms of the senior premium. The results reflect a considerable flattening throughout the
age distribution of the value of life, which peaks at $14.9 million, and illustrates the age
distribution of value of life estimates reported in Appendix Table 3 and in the final
column of the bottom panel of Table 4. For the instrumented total consumption hedonic
wage equation case the value of life for 57–65 year olds is 1.94 times the value for 18–21
year olds, and is below the peak multiplicative factor of 2.36 for 47–51 year olds.
On a theoretical basis the estimates for the value of life should depend strongly on
individual consumption. For that reason it is instructive to compare the life-cycle
distribution of the estimated values of life with the life-cycle distribution of consumption.
Based on the first-stage consumption estimates in Appendix Table 2, illustrations for two
pertinent consumption distributions are the fitted food plus housing consumption case
shown in Figures 4a and 4b and the fitted total consumption distribution shown in Figures
4c and 4d.
As is indicated in Figures 4a and 4b, consumption of food and housing rises and
then falls over the life cycle. In much the same way, there is an increase and subsequent
decline in the implied value of life, although the decline was not as steep for the value of

20

life in Figures 2b and 2d as the subsequent decline in the nonparametric estimates of the
consumption-age distribution plotted in Figure 4b, for example.
Estimates for fitted total consumption as a function of age in Figures 4c and 4d
imply that consumption does rise over the life cycle but the decline is much flatter for the
senior age groups than it is for food and housing consumption. In much the same way as
consumption, there is a flattening of the implied value of life curve as a function of age as
was shown in Figure 3d, for example.
The implications of the results concerning the age pattern of consumption are
twofold. There is the expected variation in the value of life over the life cycle. The value
of life is not constant but does in fact rise with age, after which it ultimately declines.
However, the decline is not as steep as the earlier increase. There is a tendency toward a
flattening of the value of life-age relationship. The flattening is particularly great for
models recognizing the dependency of the value of life on total consumption. The
character of the flattening for the value of life-age profile mirrors the shape of the
distribution of lifetime consumption. Recognition of the role of life-cycle consumption in
estimates of the value of life consequently illuminates how VSL varies over the life cycle,
as a variety of theoretical models have stressed.
Examining the life-cycle pattern of consumption for workers reveals that
consumption also is not constant over the life cycle. Rather, it rises and falls, displaying
an inverted U shape that is very similar to the pattern of the value of life with a flattening
at the upper age ranges rather than a decline that mirrors the earlier increase. The lifecycle consumption pattern is more consistent with the imperfect markets life-cycle
consumption models of the value of life rather than with the perfect insurance markets

21

models. The imperfect markets models imply that the value of life will rise and then fall
over the life cycle, which is the pattern in Figures 4a–4d. Even though there is a predicted
decline in the value of life, the value of life nevertheless is closely linked to consumption
and there is a flattening of the consumption trajectory for the more senior age groups.
One would also expect a similar flattening of the estimated value of life, which is
reflected in the empirical estimates.
7. Conclusion and Environmental Health Policy Implications

The previous literature has a major disconnect between the theoretical models of
the variations of value of life over the life cycle and market-based estimates of the age
distribution of the value of life. The life-cycle approaches all use a life-cycle
consumption framework in which the value of life is an explicit function of individual
consumption levels. In contrast, no hedonic models of the value of life have ever included
consumption, thus ignoring the fundamental dependency of VSL indirectly through lifecycle consumption. The neglect of consumption may have been because not only are
consumption data not a usual component of labor market data sets but there is also a
potential endogeneity of the consumption variable.
Our research has provided the first consumption-adjusted estimates of the value of
life, which alter both the value of life estimates as well as their age-related distribution.
Recognizing the dependency on consumption increases the statistical significance and
magnitude of the estimates of the value of life, particularly for estimates including
industry controls. More important are the implications of the consumption-adjusted
values for the life-cycle distribution of the (average) value of life. The value of life rises
then falls over the life cycle, but the eventual declines are reasonably flat. The inverted

22

U-shape pattern of value of life over the lifetime closely follows the time distribution of
consumption shown by the nonparametric estimates of the consumption-age relationship.
The greatest policy interest in the age variation of the value of life stems from the
degree to which there should be a senior discount in the value of life used to evaluate the
benefits associated with regulatory policies that reduce risks to life and health. Our results
show that the implied value of life declines somewhat for the most senior age group in
the sample. Even though the VSLs for the elderly are lower than the peak value of life in
middle-age, they are still higher than the values of life for workers age 36 and below.
How our results could affect policy judgments is exemplified by applying the
estimates to the U.S. EPA Clear Skies Initiative, in which the issue of a senior discount
achieved prominence. The first column of Table 5 lists the reduced annual fatalities for a
base case reflecting current scientific knowledge of the effects of long-term exposures
and an alternative case based on risks from short-term exposures. 19 Note that the
mortality reduction effects are concentrated among the elderly. The second column
indicates the undiscounted annual benefits in year 2010 for each component monetized
using the EPA’s average value of $6.1 million per life for all lives. 20 The mortality
benefits for adults over 65 are $36.6 billion for the base case and $21.9 billion for the
alternative estimates. However, using the 37 percent senior discount advocated in the
controversial U.S. EPA (2002) report, the mortality benefit figure drops to $23.1 billion
for the base case and $14.7 billion for the EPA’s alternative estimates. 21 If we use our
consumption-adjusted estimates of the relative values of life for the age group 57–65 as
19

See the U.S. EPA (2003), Table 16, for the total mortality figures.
The $6.1 million per life figure is from the U.S. EPA (2003), p. 26, which is an update of the $6.0 million
figure used in U.S. EPA (2002).
21
The 37 percent discount figure cited in U.S. EPA (2002), p. 35, is derived from the stated preference
survey results in the U.K. by Jones-Lee (1989).
20

23

the benchmark for assessing values to those 65 and older, the benefit values increase to
$37.1 billion for the base case and $22.3 billion for the alternative case. 22 In contrast, the
benefit values for children are half as great using the relative benefit values for persons
age 18–21 to impute an estimate of their value of life. Although the benefit estimates are
only meant to be suggestive, they indicate how using a consumption-adjusted value of
life can lead to a significant senior benefit premium rather than a senior discount.
Framing the valuation question in terms of whether there is a decline in the value
of life with age mischaracterizes the information needs for policy assessments. Standard
policy evaluations use an average value of life for an entire population to assess the
benefits. The pertinent question is whether for the senior age groups there should be a
discount or premium relative to the population average, not with respect to the peak value
of life. Our results in Appendix Table 3 for the age 57–65 group indicate that for every
set of estimates the implied value of life for ages 57–65 is somewhat higher than the
overall average for workers of all ages. At least for the pre-retirement age groups we
study, the benefits assessment issue of whether there is a senior discount is in fact a nonissue.

22

The relative value of life estimates in the last column of Table 5 use the statistics from Appendix Table 3,
without industry controls, with total consumption, IV.
