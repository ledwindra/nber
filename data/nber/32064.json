    "abstract": "\n\nShareholders want a firm\u2019s objective function to place some weight on consumer welfare, motivated by both self-interest and altruism. Firms have a unique technology for improving consumer welfare: lowering inefficient price markups. Optimal pricing formulas can account for shareholders\u2019 marginal rate of substitution between profits and consumer welfare. Calibrations show shareholders should place non-trivial weights on consumers. A survey experiment with a representative sample shows how shareholders would vote on resolutions giving strategic guidance to firms. Only 7% would vote for pure profit maximization. The median individual is indifferent between $0.44 in profits or $1 in consumer surplus.\n\n",
