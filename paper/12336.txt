ABSTRACT
The sensitivity of U.S. aggregate investment to shocks is procyclical: the initial response increases
by approximately 50% from the trough to the peak of the business cycle. This feature of the data follows
naturally from a DSGE model with lumpy microeconomic capital adjustment. Beyond explaining this
specific time variation, our model and evidence provide a counterexample to the claim that microeconomic
investment lumpiness is inconsequential for macroeconomic analysis.

1 Introduction
U.S. non-residential private fixed investment exhibits conditional heteroscedasticity. Figure 1
depicts a smooth, nonparametric estimate of the heteroscedasticity of the residual from fitting
an AR(1) process to quarterly aggregate investment rate from 1960 to 2005, as a function of the
average recent investment rate (see Appendix C for details). This figure shows that investment
is significantly more responsive to shocks in times of high investment.1

In this paper we show that this nonlinear feature of the data follows naturally from a DSGE
model with lumpy microeconomic investment. The reason for conditional heteroscedasticity in
the model, is that the impulse response function is history dependent, with an initial response
that increases by roughly 50% from the bottom to the peak of the business cycle. In particular,
the longer an expansion, the larger the response of investment to further shocks. Conversely,
investment slumps are hard to recover from.
More broadly, our calibrated model suggests that over the 1960-2005 period the initial response of investment to a productivity shock in the top quartile is 32% higher than the average
response in the bottom quartile. Differences go beyond the initial response. The left panel in
Figure 2 depicts the response over time to a one standard deviation shock taking place at selected points of the U.S. investment cycle: the trough in 1961, a period of average investment
activity in 1989 and the peak in 2000.2 The variability of these impulse responses is apparent

and large. For example, the immediate response to a shock in the trough in 1961 and the peak
in 2000 differ by roughly 50%. The contrast with the right panel of this figure, which depicts the
impulse responses for a model with no microeconomic frictions in investment (essentially, the
standard RBC model), is evident: For the latter, the impulse responses vary little over time.
Beyond explaining the rich nonlinear dynamics of aggregate investment rates, our model
provides a counterexample to the claim that microeconomic investment lumpiness is inconsequential for macroeconomic analysis. This is relevant, since even though Caballero and Engel
(1999) found substantial aggregate nonlinearities in a partial equilibrium model with lumpy
capital adjustment, recent and important methodological contributions by Veracierto (2002),
Thomas (2002) and Khan and Thomas (2003, 2008) have provided examples of situations where
general equilibrium undoes the partial equilibrium features.
Why do we reach such a different conclusion? Because, implicitly, their particular calibrations impose that the bulk of investment dynamics is determined by general equilibrium constraints rather than by adjustment costs. Instead, we focus our calibration effort on gauging
the relative importance of these forces, and conclude that both adjustment costs and general
equilibrium forces play a relevant role.
Concretely, the objective in any dynamic macroeconomic model is to trace the impact of
aggregate shocks on aggregate endogenous variables (investment in our context). The typical
response is less than one-for-one upon impact, as a variety of microeconomic frictions and
general equilibrium constraints smooth and spread over time the response of the endogenous
variable. We refer to this process as smoothing, and decompose it into its pre-general equilibrium (PE) and general equilibrium (GE) components. In the context of nonlinear lumpy-

2

adjustment models, PE-smoothing does not refer to the existence of microeconomic inaction
and lumpiness per se, but to the impact these have on aggregate smoothing. This is a key distinction in this class of models, as in many instances microeconomic inaction translates into
limited aggregate inertia (recall the classic Caplin and Spulber (1987) result, where price-setters
follow Ss rules but the aggregate price level behaves as if there were no microeconomic frictions). In a nutshell, our key difference with the previous literature is that the latter explored
combinations of parameter values that implied microeconomic lumpiness but left almost no
role for PE-smoothing, thereby precluding the possibility of fitting facts such as the conditional
heteroscedasticity of aggregate investment rates depicted in Figure 1.

Table 1 illustrates our model’s decomposition into PE- and GE-smoothing. The upper entry shows the volatility of aggregate investment rates in our model when neither smoothing
mechanism is present (in other words, when there are no adjustment costs at the microeconomic level and no price adjustments in the economy). The intermediate entries incorporate
PE- and GE-smoothing, one at a time, while the lower entry considers both sources of smoothing simultaneously. The reduction of the quarterly standard deviation of the aggregate investment rate achieved by PE-smoothing alone amounts to 81.0% of the reduction achieved by the
combination of both smoothing mechanisms. Alternatively, the additional smoothing achieved
by PE-forces, compared with what GE-smoothing achieves by itself, is 15.4% of the smoothing
achieved by both sources.
It is clear that both sources of smoothing do not enter additively, so some care is needed
3

when quantifying the contribution of each source to overall smoothing. Nonetheless, averaging
the upper and lower bounds mentioned above suggests roughly similar roles for both sources
of smoothing in our model.3 By contrast, as discussed in detail in Section 3, the contribution
of PE-smoothing is very small in the recent literature—typically the upper bound is under 20%
while the lower bound is zero.
Given its centrality in differentiating our answer from that of previous models, our calibration strategy is designed to capture the role of PE-smoothing as directly as possible. To this effect, we use sectoral data to calibrate the parameters that control the impact of micro-frictions
on aggregates, before general equilibrium forces have a chance to play a smoothing role. Specifically, we argue that the response of semi-aggregated (e.g., 3-digit) investment to corresponding
sectoral shocks is less subject to general equilibrium forces, and hence serves to identify the
relative importance of PE-smoothing.

where NONE refers to the pre-general equilibrium model with no microeconomic frictions, PE to the model that
only has microeconomic frictions so that prices are fixed, GE to the model with only GE constraints, and BOTH to
the model with both micro frictions and GE constraints.

Sectoral investment data are only available at an annual frequency. The numbers in rows two and three come
from the annual analogues of our quarterly baseline models. For details, see Appendices A and B. The volatility
of aggregate investment rates in Table 2 for Kahn and Thomas is taken from table III in Kahn and Thomas (2008).
The volatility of sectoral investment rates is based on our calculations. We add their idiosyncratic shock and our
sectoral shock to compute the total standard deviation for the PE-innovations. The lumpy model in Kahn and
Thomas (2008) exhibits larger sectoral volatility than the frictionless counterpart of our lumpy model because of
parameter differences between our model and theirs, such as the curvature of the revenue function (see details
in section 3). What matters for our purposes is that either one fails to match sectoral volatilities by an order of
magnitude.

fails to match the sectoral data (it was never designed to do so). In contrast, by reallocating
smoothing from GE- to PE-forces, the lumpy investment model is able to match both aggregate
and sectoral volatility. This pins down our decomposition and is, together with the conditionalheteroscedasticity feature, the essence of our calibration strategy.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section we present our dynamic general equilibrium model. Section 3 discusses the calibration method in detail. Sections 4 presents the main macroeconomic implications of the model and Section 5 shows the
robustness of the main results. Section 6 concludes and is followed by several appendices.

2 The Model
In this section we describe our model economy. We start with the problem of the production
units, followed by a brief description of the households and the definition of equilibrium. We
conclude with a sketch of the equilibrium computation. We follow closely Kahn and Thomas
(2008), henceforth KT, both in terms of substance and notation. Aside from parameter differences, we have three main departures from KT. First, production units face persistent sectorspecific productivity shocks, in addition to aggregate and idiosyncratic shocks. Second, production units undertake some within-period maintenance investment which is necessary to
continue operation (there is fixed proportions and some parts and machines that break down
need to be replaced, see, e.g., McGrattan and Schmitz (1999) for evidence on the importance of
maintenance investment). Third, the distribution of aggregate productivity shocks is continuous rather than a Markov discretization.5

2.1 Production Units
The economy consists of a large number of sectors, which are each populated by a continuum
of production units. Since we do not model entry and exit decisions, the mass of these continua
is fixed and normalized to one. There is one commodity in the economy that can be consumed
or invested. Each production unit produces this commodity, employing its pre-determined
capital stock (k) and labor (n), according to the following Cobb-Douglas decreasing-returnsto-scale production function (θ > 0, ν > 0, θ + ν < 1):
y t = z t ²S,t ²I ,t k tθ n tν ,

(1)

5
This allows us to do computations that are not feasible with a Markov discretization. For example, backing out
the aggregate shocks that are fed into the model to produce Figure 3.

5

where z t , ²S and ²I denote aggregate, sectoral and unit-specific (idiosyncratic) productivity
shocks.
We denote the trend growth rate of aggregate productivity by (1 − θ)(γ − 1), so that y and k
grow at rate γ−1 along the balanced growth path. From now on we work with k and y (and later
C ) in efficiency units. The detrended aggregate productivity level, which we also denote by z,
evolves according to an AR(1) process in logs, with normal innovations v with zero mean and
variance σ2A :
log z t = ρ A log z t −1 + v t .

(2)

The sectoral and idiosyncratic technology processes follow Markov chains, that are approximations to continuous AR(1) processes with Gaussian innovations.6 The latter have standard
deviations σS and σI , and autocorrelations ρ S and ρ I , respectively. Productivity innovations
at different aggregation levels are independent. Also, sectoral productivity shocks are independent across sectors and idiosyncratic productivity shocks are independent across productive
units.
Each period a production unit draws from a time-invariant distribution, G, its current cost of
capital adjustment, ξ ≥ 0, which is denominated in units of labor. G is a uniform distribution on
[0, ξ̄], common to all units. Draws are independent across units and over time, and employment
is freely adjustable.
At the beginning of a period, a production unit is characterized by its pre-determined capital
stock, the sector it belongs to and the corresponding sectoral productivity level, its idiosyncratic
productivity, and its capital adjustment cost. Given the aggregate state, it decides its employment level, n, production occurs, maintenance is carried out, workers are paid, and investment
decisions are made. Then the period ends.
Upon investment the unit incurs a fixed cost of ωξ, where ω is the current real wage rate.
Capital depreciates at a rate δ, but units may find it necessary to replace certain items during
the production process.
Define ψ̄ ≡

γ
1−δ

> 1 as the maintenance investment rate needed to fully compensate depre-

ciation and trend growth. The degree of necessary maintenance, χ, can then be conveniently
defined as a fraction of ψ̄. If χ = 0, no maintenance investment is needed; if χ = 1, all depreciation and trend growth must be undone for a production unit to continue operation. We can now
summarize the evolution of the unit’s capital stock (in efficiency units) between two consecutive periods, from k to k 0 , after non-maintenance investment i and maintenance investment
i M = χ(γ − 1 + δ)k take place, as follows:

We use the discretization in Tauchen (1986), see Appendix D for details.

(1 − δ)(1 − χ) + χγ k

If χ = 0, then k 0 = (1 − δ)k/γ, while k 0 = k if χ = 100%. We treat χ as a primitive parameter.7
Notice that χ is obviously irrelevant for the units that actually adjust at the end of the period.
This is not to say that these units do not have to spend on maintenance within the production
period, but rather their net capital growth, conditional on incurring the fixed cost and optimal adjustment, is independent of this expenditure. This is essentially a feature of only having
fixed adjustment costs, as opposed to more general adjustment technologies that also include
a component that depends on the magnitude of capital adjustments.
Given the i.i.d. nature of the adjustment costs, it is sufficient to describe differences across
production units and their evolution by the distribution of units over (²S , ²I , k). We denote this
distribution by µ. Thus, (z, µ) constitutes the current aggregate state and µ evolves according to
the law of motion µ0 = Γ(z, µ), which production units take as given.
Next we describe the dynamic programming problem of each production unit. We will take
two shortcuts (details can be found in KT). First, we state the problem in terms of utils of the
representative household (rather than physical units), and denote by p = p(z, µ) the marginal
utility of consumption. This is the relative intertemporal price faced by a production unit. Second, given the i.i.d. nature of the adjustment costs, continuation values can be expressed without explicitly taking into account future adjustment costs.
It will simplify notation to define an additional parameter, ψ ∈ [1, ψ̄]:
ψ = 1 + (ψ̄ − 1)χ,

(3)

and write maintenance investment as:8
i M = (ψ − 1)(1 − δ)k.

(4)

Let V 1 (²S , ²I , k, ξ; z, µ) denote the expected discounted value—in utils—of a unit that is in
idiosyncratic state (²I , k, ξ), and is in a sector with sectoral productivity ²S , given the aggregate
state (z, µ). Then the expected value prior to the realization of the adjustment cost draw is given
7

We note that our version of maintenance investment differs from what KT call “constrained investment”. Here,
maintenance refers to the replacement of parts and machines without which production cannot continue, while
in KT it is an extra margin of adjustment for small investment projects.
8
Note that if ψ = 1, then i M = 0, and if ψ = ψ̄, then i M = (γ − 1 + δ)k, undoing all trend devaluation of the capital
stock.

n

(6)

where CF denotes the firm’s flow value, Vi the firm’s continuation value if it chooses inaction
and does not adjust, and Va the continuation value, net of adjustment costs AC , if the firm
adjusts its capital stock. That is:
CF = [z²S ²I k θ n ν − ω(z, µ)n − i M ]p(z, µ),

(7a)

Vi = βE[V 0 (²0S , ²0I , ψ(1 − δ)k/γ; z 0 , µ0 )],

AC = ξω(z, µ)p(z, µ),

(7c)

Va = −i p(z, µ) + βE[V 0 (²0S , ²0I , k 0 ; z 0 , µ0 )],

(7d)

where both expectation operators average over next period’s realizations of the aggregate, sectoral and idiosyncratic shocks, conditional on this period’s values, and we recall that i M =
(ψ − 1)(1 − δ)k and i = γk 0 − (1 − δ)k − i M . Also, β denotes the discount factor from the representative household.
Taking as given intra- and intertemporal prices ω(z, µ) and p(z, µ), and the law of motion
µ0 = Γ(z, µ), the production unit chooses optimally labor demand, whether to adjust its capital
stock at the end of the period, and the optimal capital stock, conditional on adjustment. This
leads to policy functions: N = N (²S , ²I , k; z, µ) and K = K (²S , ²I , k, ξ; z, µ). Since capital is predetermined, the optimal employment decision is independent of the current adjustment cost
draw.

2.2 Households
We assume a continuum of identical households that have access to a complete set of statecontingent claims. Hence, there is no heterogeneity across households. Moreover, they own
shares in the production units and are paid dividends. We do not need to model the household side explicitly (see KT for details), and concentrate instead on the first-order conditions to
determine the equilibrium wage and the intertemporal price.

8

Households have a standard felicity function in consumption and (indivisible) labor:
U (C , N h ) = logC − AN h ,

(8)

where C denotes consumption and N h the fraction of household members that work. Households maximize the expected present discounted value of the above felicity function. By definition we have:
p(z, µ) ≡ UC (C , N h ) =

C (z, µ)

1. Production unit optimality: Taking ω, p and Γ as given, V 1 (²S , ²I , k; z, µ) solves (6) and the

5. Model consistent dynamics: The evolution of the cross-section that characterizes the economy, µ0 = Γ(z, µ), is induced by K (²S , ²I , k, ξ; z, µ) and the exogenous processes for z, ²S
and ²I .
Conditions 1, 2, 3 and 4 define an equilibrium given Γ, while step 5 specifies the equilibrium
condition for Γ.

2.4 Solution
As is well-known, (6) is not computable, since µ is infinite dimensional. Hence, we follow
Krusell and Smith (1997, 1998) and approximate the distribution µ by its first moment over
capital, and its evolution, Γ, by a simple log-linear rule. In the same vein, we approximate the
equilibrium pricing function by a log-linear rule:
log k¯0 =a k + b k log k̄ + c k log z,

(11a)

log p =a p + b p log k̄ + c p log z,

(11b)

where k̄ denotes aggregate capital holdings. Given (10), we do not have to specify an equilibrium rule for the real wage. As usual with this procedure, we posit this form and verify that in
equilibrium it yields a good fit to the actual law of motion (see Appendix D for details).
To implement the computation of sectoral investment rates, we simplify the problem further and impose two additional assumptions: 1) ρ S = ρ I = ρ and 2) enough sectors, so that sectoral shocks have no aggregate effects. Both assumptions combined allow us to reduce the state
space in the production unit’s problem further to a combined technology level ² ≡ ²S ²I . Now,
log ² follows an AR(1) with first-order autocorrelation ρ and Gaussian innovations N (0, σ2 ), with
σ2 ≡ σ2S +σ2I . Since the sectoral technology level has no aggregate consequences by assumption,
the production unit cannot use it to extract any more information about the future than it has
already from the combined technology level. Finally, it is this combined productivity level that
is discretized into a 19-state Markov chain. The second assumption allows us to compute the
sectoral problem independently of the aggregate general equilibrium problem.9
Combining these assumptions and substituting k̄ for µ into (6) and using (11a)–(11b), we
9

In Appendix D.3 we show that our results are robust to this simplifying assumption.

10

have that (7a)–(7d) become
CF =[z²k θ n ν − ω(z, k̄)n − i M ]p(z, k̄),

(12a)

Vi =βE[V 0 (²0 , ψ(1 − δ)k/γ; z 0 , k̄ 0 )],

(12b)

AC =ξω(z, k̄)p(z, k̄),

(12c)

Va = − i p(z, k̄) + βE[V 0 (²0 , k 0 ; z 0 , k̄ 0 )].

(12d)

With the above expressions, (6) becomes a computable dynamic programming problem with
policy functions N = N (², k; z, k̄) and K = K (², k, ξ; z, k̄). We solve this problem via value function
iteration on V 0 and Gauss-Hermitian numerical integration over log(z) (see Appendix D for
details).
Several features facilitate the solution of the model. First, as mentioned above, the employment decision is static. In particular it is independent of the investment decision at the end of
the period. Hence we can use the production unit’s first-order condition to maximize out the
optimal employment level:
µ

N (², k; z, k̄) =

ω(z, k̄)

¶1/(ν−1)

.

νz²k θ

(13)

Next we comment on the computation of the production unit’s decision rules and value
function, given the equilibrium pricing and movement rules (11a)–(11b). From (12d) it is obvious that neither Va nor the optimal target capital level, conditional on adjustment, depend on
current capital holdings. This reduces the number of optimization problems in the value function iteration considerably. Comparing (12d) with (12b) shows that Va (²; z, k̄) ≥ Vi (², k; z, k̄).10
It follows that there exists an adjustment cost factor that makes a production unit indifferent
between adjusting and not adjusting:
ξ̂(², k; z, k̄) =

Va (²; z, k̄) − Vi (², k; z, k̄)
ω(z, k̄)p(z, k̄)

≥ 0.

(14)

¡
¢
We define ξT (², k; z, k̄) ≡ min ξ̄, ξ̂(², k; z, k̄) . Production units with ξ ≤ ξT (², k; z, k̄) will adjust

their capital stock. Thus,

k 0 = K (², k, ξ; z, k̄) =


∗


 k (²; z, k̄)

if ξ ≤ ξT (², k; z, k̄),



 ψ(1 − δ)k/γ otherwise.
10

The production unit can always choose i = 0 and thus k ∗ = ψ(1 − δ)k/γ.

11

(15)

We define mandated investment for a unit with current state (², z, k̄) and current capital k as:
Mandated investment ≡ log γk ∗ (²; z, k̄) − log ψ(1 − δ)k.
That is, mandated investment is the investment rate the unit would undertake, after maintaining its capital, if its current adjustment cost draw were equal to zero.
Now we turn to the second step of the computational procedure takes the value function
0

V (², k; z, k̄) as given, and pre-specifies a randomly drawn sequence of aggregate technology
levels: {z t }. We start from an arbitrary distribution µ0 , implying a value k̄ 0 . We then recompute (6), using (12a)–(12d), at every point along the sequence {z t }, and the implied sequence of
aggregate capital levels {k̄ t }, without imposing the equilibrium pricing rule (11a):

with Vi defined in (7b) and evaluated at k̄ 0 = k̄ 0 (k t ). This yields new “policy functions”
Ñ

= Ñ (², k; z t , k̄ t , p)

K̃

= K̃ (², k, ξ; z t , k̄ t , p).

We then search for a p such that, given these new decision rules and after aggregation, the
goods market clears (labor market clearing is trivially satisfied). We then use this p to find the
new aggregate capital level.
This procedure generates a time series of {p t } and {k̄ t } endogenously, with which assumed
rules (11a)–(11b) can be updated via a simple OLS regression. The procedure stops when the
updated coefficients a k , b k , c k and a p , b p , c p are sufficiently close to the previous ones. We
show in Appendix D that the implied R 2 of these regressions are high for all model specifications, generally well above 0.99, indicating that production units do not make large mistakes by
using the rules (11a)–(11b). This is confirmed by the fact that adding higher moments of the
capital distribution does not increase forecasting performance significantly.

3 Calibration
Our calibration strategy and parameters are standard with two additional features: We combine
sectoral and aggregate data in order to infer the decomposition of PE- and GE-smoothing, and
we calibrate the conditional heteroscedasticity of investment in U.S. data.

12

3.1 Calibration Strategy
The model period for the baseline model is a quarter. The following parameters have standard
values: β = 0.9942, γ = 0.004, ν = 0.64, and ρ A = 0.95. The log-felicity function features an
elasticity of intertemporal substitution (EIS) of one. The depreciation rate δ is picked to match
the average quarterly investment rate in the data: 0.026, which leads to δ = 0.022. The disutility
of work parameter, A, is chosen to generate an employment rate of 0.6.
Next we explain our choices for θ, σ A and the parameters of the sectoral and idiosyncratic
technology process (ρ S , σS , ρ I and σI ). This is followed by a detailed discussion of how we
calibrate the adjustment cost parameter, ξ̄, and the maintenance parameter, χ, which are at the
heart of our calibration strategy.
The output elasticity of capital, θ, is set to 0.18, in order to capture a revenue elasticity of
capital,

θ
1−ν ,

equal to 0.5, while keeping the labor share at its 0.64-value.11 For comparability in

the second moments, σ A is picked to make both the lumpy and the frictionless models match
the volatility of the quarterly aggregate investment rate (0.0023) perfectly.12
We determine σS and ρ S by a standard Solow residual calculation on annual 3-digit manufacturing data, taking into account sector-specific trends and time aggregation (see Appendices A and B for details). σS equals 0.0273 and ρ S 0.8612. For computational feasibility we set
ρ I = ρ S , and σI to 0.0472, which makes the annual total standard deviation of sectoral and idiosyncratic shocks 0.10. We turn now to the calibration of the two key parameters of the model,
ξ̄ and χ.
With the availability of new and more detailed establishment level data, researchers have
calibrated adjustment costs by matching establishment level moments (see, e.g., KT). This is a
promising strategy in many instances, however, there are two sources of concern in the context
of this paper’s objectives. First, one must take a stance regarding the number of productive units
in the model that correspond to one productive unit in the available micro data. Some authors
(e.g., KT) assume that this correspondence is one-to-one, while other authors (e.g., Abel and
Eberly (2002) and Bloom (2007)) match a large number—a continuum and 250, respectively—
of model-micro-units to one observed productive unit (firm or establishment).
Second, in state dependent models the frequency of microeconomic adjustment is not sufficient to pin down the object of primary concern, which is the aggregate impact of adjustment costs. Parameter changes in other parts of the model can have a substantial effect on this
11

In a world with constant returns to scale and imperfect competition this amounts to a markup of approximately
22%. The curvature of our production function lies between the values considered by KT and Gourio and Kashyap
(2007).

See Appendix A for the values. For annual calibrations, we target 0.0098 as the volatility of the aggregate investment rate.

statistic, even in partial equilibrium. For example, anything that changes the drift of mandated
investment (such as maintenance investment), changes the mapping from microeconomic adjustment costs to aggregate dynamics. Caplin and Spulber (1987) provide an extreme example
of this phenomenon, where aggregate behavior is totally unrelated to microeconomic adjustment costs.13
Because of these concerns, we follow an alternative approach where we use 3-digit sectoral
rather than plant level data to calibrate adjustment costs. More precisely, given a value of χ,
we choose ξ̄ to match the volatility of sectoral U.S. investment rates. Having done this, we
choose σ A to match the volatility of the aggregate U.S. investment rate. In this approach we
assume that the sectors we consider are sufficiently disaggregated so that general equilibrium
effects can be ignored while, at the same time, there are enough micro units in them to justify
the computational simplifications that can be made with a large number of units. Hence the
choice of the 3-digit level.
Given a set of parameters, the sequence of sectoral investment rates is generated as follows:
the units’ optimal policies are determined as described in Section 2.4, working in general equilibrium. Next, starting at the steady state, the economy is subjected to a sequence of sectoral
shocks. Since sectoral shocks are assumed to have no aggregate effects and ρ I = ρ S , productive
units perceive them as part of their idiosyncratic shock and use their optimal policies with a
value of one for the aggregate shock and a value equal to the product of the sectoral and idiosyncratic shock—i.e. log(²) = log(²S ) + log(²I )—for the idiosyncratic shock.14
The value of sectoral volatility of annual investment rates we match is 0.0163.15 As noted in
the introduction, this number is one order of magnitude smaller than the one predicted by the
frictionless model.
Finally, we calibrate the maintenance parameter χ by matching the logarithm of the ratio
between the maximum and minimum of the estimated values for the conditional heteroscedasticity; we refer to this statistic as the heteroscedasticity range in what follows. That is, given a
quarterly series of aggregate investment rates, x t , the moment we match is obtained by first
regressing the series on its lagged value and then regressing the absolute residual from this re13

In Appendix E we present a simple extension of the paper’s main model, to show how by adding two micro
parameters with no macroeconomic or sectoral consequences one can obtain a very good fit of observed micro
moments. The problems of matching micro moments and matching aggregate moments are orthogonal in this
extension.
14
Appendix D.3 describes the details of the sectoral computation. There we also document a robustness exercise where we relax the assumption that sectoral shocks have no general equilibrium effects, and recompute the
optimal policies when micro units consider the distribution of sectoral productivity shocks—summarized by its
mean—as an additional state variable. Our main results are essentially unchanged by this extension.

We time-aggregate the quarterly investment rates generated by the model to obtain this number. For details,

gression, |ê t |, on x t −1 (both regressions are estimated via OLS):
|ê t | = α̂0 + α̂1 x t −1 + error.

(16)

Denoting by σmax and σmin the largest and smallest fitted values from the regression in (16), the
heteroscedasticity range is equal to ± log(σmax /σmin ), with a positive sign when the maximum
lies to the right of the minimum and a negative sign otherwise. The target value for the heteroscedasticity range in the data is 0.3971, which implies a variation in the initial response to
shocks that increases by approximately 50% from the trough to the peak of the business cycle
(e 0.3971 ' 1.49). Of course, when simulating our model to calculate the average heteroscedasticity range for given parameter values, the length of the simulated series is equal to the length of
the actual data (184 quarterly observations).

3.2 Calibration Results
The upper bound of the adjustment cost distribution, ξ̄, and the maintenance parameter, χ, that
jointly match the sectoral investment volatility and the conditional heteroscedasticity statistic
are ξ̄ = 8.8 and χ = 0.50, respectively. The average cost actually paid is much lower, as shown
in Table 3, since productive units wait for good draws to adjust. Conditional on adjusting, a
production unit pays 9.53% of its quarterly output (column 3) or, equivalently, 14.88% of its
regular wage bill (column 4). To be able to compare these findings with the annual adjustment
cost estimates in the literature, we also report these numbers for an annual analogue of the
quarterly model. With 3.60% and 5.62%, respectively, they appear to be at the lower end of
the literature (see Caballero and Engel (1999), Cooper and Haltiwanger (2006) as well as Bloom
(2007)). The first two columns report the aggregate resources spent on adjustment, as a fraction
of aggregate output and aggregate investment, respectively.

The first two rows of Table 2 in the introduction and Table 4 below show that our model fits
both the sectoral and aggregate volatility of investment, as well as the degree of conditional het15

that neither the frictionless counterpart of our model nor the KT model match these features of
the data.

Ultimately, the main difference between our calibration and KT is the size of the adjustment
cost. Tables 5 and 6 make this point. The former reports upper and lower bounds for the contribution of PE-smoothing to total smoothing, for several models, at different frequencies. The
main message can be gathered from the first two rows of these tables. In Table 5 we see that by
changing the adjustment cost distribution in KT’s model for ours,16 its ability to generate substantial PE-smoothing rises significantly. Conversely, introducing KT adjustment costs into an
annual version of our lumpy model with zero maintenance (third row) leads to a similarly small
role of PE-smoothing as in their model. Rows four to seven show the much larger role for PEsmoothing under our calibration strategy, robustly for annual and quarterly calibrations and
low and high values of the maintenance parameters. Table 6 shows the economic magnitudes
of the different assumptions on adjustment costs.

Since KT measure labor in time units (and therefore calibrate to a steady state value of 0.3), and we measure
labor in employment units, the steady state value of which is 0.6, and adjustment costs in both cases are measured
in labor units, we actually use half of our calibrated adjustment cost parameter. Conversely, when we insert KT
adjustment costs into our model, we double it.

3.3 Conventional RBC Moments
Before turning to the specific aggregate implications and mechanisms of microeconomic lumpiness that are behind the empirical success of our model, we show that these gains do not come
at the cost of sacrificing conventional RBC-moment-matching. Tables 7 and 8 report standard
longitudinal second moments for both the lumpy model and its frictionless counterpart. We
also include a model with no idiosyncratic shocks and the higher revenue elasticity of KT (we
label it RBC). As with all models, the volatility of aggregate productivity shocks is chosen so as
to match the volatility of the aggregate investment rate.17

Overall, the second moments of the lumpy model are reasonable and comparable to those
of the frictionless models. While the former exacerbates the inability of RBC models to match
the volatility of employment (we use data from the establishment survey on total employment
from the BLS), the lumpy model improves significantly when matching the volatility of consumption.18 It also increases slightly the persistence of most aggregate variables, bringing these
statistics closer to their values in the data.
17
The value of σ A required for the RBC model is 0.0058. For the lumpy model, the employment statistics are
computed from total employment, that is including those workers who work on adjusting the capital stock. We
work with all variables in logs and detrend then with an HP-filter using a bandwidth of 1600.
18
Consistent with our model, we define aggregate consumption as consumption of nondurables and service minus housing services. Also, we define output as the sum of this consumption aggregate and aggregate investment.

4 Aggregate Investment Dynamics
In this section we describe the mechanism behind our model’s ability to match the conditional
heteroscedasticity of aggregate investment rates. In particular, we show that lumpy adjustment
models generate history dependent aggregate impulse responses.

Figure 3 plots the evolution of the quarterly responsiveness index defined in Caballero and
Engel (1993b) for the 1960-2005 period (in percentage deviations from its “steady state” value).
The solid and dashed lines represent the index for the lumpy and frictionless models, respectively, while the vertical lines denote NBER business cycle dates.19 This index captures the response upon impact of the aggregate investment rate to an innovation. At each point in time,
this index is calculated conditional on the history of shocks, summarized by the current dis19

We use the term “steady state” to refer to the ergodic (time-average) distribution, which we calculate as follows:
starting from an arbitrary capital distribution and the ergodic distribution of the idiosyncratic shocks, we simulate
the development of an economy with zero aggregate innovations for 300 periods, but using the policy functions
under the assumption of an economy subject to aggregate shocks.

18

tribution of capital across units (see Appendix F for the formal definition). That is, the index
corresponds to the first element of the impulse response conditional on the cross-section of
capital in the given year. The shocks fed into the model are those that allow us to match actual
aggregate quarterly investment rates over the sample period. We initialize the process with the
economy at its steady state in the fourth quarter of 1959.
The figure confirms the statement in the introduction according to which the initial response to an aggregate shock varies significantly over time, as does the responsiveness index
which takes values between 0.0161 and 0.0243; this means the responsiveness of the economy
differs by 51% between trough and peak. By contrast, the frictionless model’s responsiveness
index and impulse responses exhibit very little variation: they vary by only 12% between trough
and peak.
To explain how lumpy adjustment models generate time-varying impulse responses, we
consider a particular sample path that is roughly designed to mimic the boom-bust investment
episode in the U.S. during the last decade. For this, we simulate the paths of the frictionless and
lumpy economies that result from a sequence of twenty consecutive positive aggregate productivity innovations half the size of the respective model’s standard deviation, followed by a
long period where the innovations are equal to zero. The peak investment rate in the path of
the lumpy model is 2.96%, compared to 3.09% in the data. Both economies start from their
respective steady states.

Figure 4 shows the evolution of the aggregate investment rates (as log-deviation from their
19

steady state values) for both economies. There are important difference between them: While
at the outset of the boom phase their values are similar, eventually the investment rate in the
lumpy economy reacts by more than the frictionless economy to further positive shocks. The
flip side of the lumpy economy’s larger boom is a more protracted decline in investment during
the bust phase. Let us discuss these two phases in turn.

Figure 5 plots the evolution of the responsiveness index (its log-deviation from steady state),
both for the lumpy model and for the frictionless model. Note first that the index fluctuates
much less in the frictionless economy than in the lumpy economy. Recall also that the frictionless economy only has general equilibrium forces to move this index around. From these two
observations we can conjecture that the contribution of the general equilibrium forces to the
volatility of the index in the lumpy economy is minor.
It follows from this figure that it is the decline in the strength of the PE-smoothing mechanism that is responsible for the rise in the index during the boom phase. When this mechanism
is weakened, the index of responsiveness in the lumpy economy exceeds that of the frictionless
economy, which explains the larger investment boom observed in the lumpy economy after a
history of positive shocks.
Figure 6 illustrates why the PE-smoothing mechanism weakens as the boom progresses. It
shows the cross-section of mandated investment (and the probability of adjusting, conditional
on mandated investment) at three points in time: the beginning of the episode with the economy at its steady state (solid line), the peak of the boom (dashed line) and the trough of the

cycle (doted line).20 It is apparent from this figure that during the boom the cross-section of
mandated investment moves toward regions where the probability of adjustment is higher and
steeper. The fraction of micro units with mandated investment close to zero decreases considerably during the boom, while the fraction of units with mandated investment rates above 40%
increases significantly. Also note that the fraction of units in the region where mandated investment is negative decreases during the boom, since the sequence of positive shocks moves units
away from this region.
The convex curves in Figure 6 depict the state-dependent adjustment hazard; that is, the
probability of adjusting conditional on the corresponding value of mandated investment. It is
clear that the probability of adjusting increases with the (absolute) value of mandated investment. This is the ‘increasing hazard property’ described in Caballero and Engel (1993a). The
convexity of the estimated state-dependent adjustment hazards implies that the probability
that a shock induces a micro unit to adjust is larger for units with larger values of mandated
investment. Since units move into the region with a higher slope of the adjustment hazard
during the boom, aggregate investment becomes more responsive. This effect is further compounded by the fact that the adjustment hazard shifts upward as the boom proceeds, although
20

See Section 2.4 for the formal definition of mandated investment. Also note that the scale on the left of the
figure is for the mandated investment densities, while the scale on the right is for the adjustment hazards.

21

this mechanism is small.
In summary, the decline in the strength of PE-smoothing during the boom (and hence the
larger response to shocks) results mainly from the rise in the share of agents that adjust to further shocks. This is in contrast with the frictionless (and Calvo style models) where the only
margin of adjustment is the average size of these adjustments. This is shown in Figure 7, which
decomposes the responsiveness index into two components: one that reflects the response of
the fraction of adjusters (the extensive margin) and another that captures the response of average adjustments of those who adjust (the intensive margin). It is apparent that most of the
change in the responsiveness index is accounted for by variations in the fraction of adjusters,
that is, by the extensive margin.

The importance of fluctuations in the fraction of adjusters is also apparent in the decomposition of the path of the aggregate investment rate into the contributions from the fluctuation
of the fraction of adjusters and the fluctuation of the average size of adjustments, as shown
in Figure 8. Both series are in log-deviations from their steady state values. This is consistent
with what Doms and Dunne (1998) documented for establishment level investment in the U.S.,
where the fraction of units undergoing major investment episodes accounts for a much higher
share of aggregate (manufacturing in their case) investment than the average size of their investment.

Let us now turn to the bust phase. Figure 9 illustrates the “overaccumulation” of capital
resulting from the large investment boom in the lumpy economy. As a result of this boom,
once the positive shocks subside, the economy experiences an “overhang” that leads to the
protracted investment slump shown in Figure 4 and the sharp drop in the responsiveness index
shown in Figure 5.

The observed slump in the responsiveness index has important implications for the economy’s ability to return to its steady state investment rate, as the latter becomes unresponsive
to positive stimuli, such as a positive aggregate shock or policy intervention (e.g., an investment tax credit). Figure 10 illustrates this mechanism by plotting the impulse responses of the
frictionless and lumpy economies following a positive aggregate shock that takes place at their
respective troughs.21 The more sluggish response of investment in the lumpy economy is apparent.
As shown in Figure 3 at the beginning of this section, the insights we obtained from our
study of the boom-bust episode apply more generally. On average, investment responds more
to aggregate shocks after a sequence of above-average shocks, than after a sequence of belowaverage shocks. The response to a sequence of average shocks, which corresponds to the standard impulse response function calculated for a linear model, is in between both cases and fails
to capture the significant time-variation of the impulse responses in our model.
21

These impulse responses are plotted in deviations from the paths without the new shock and normalized by
the data’s average aggregate quarterly investment rate.

5 Robustness
Our calibration exercise yields a relatively large maintenance coefficient, χ = 0.5, while the limited evidence available suggests values somewhere between 0.25 and 0.40.22 In this section we
show that allowing for larger values of the EIS yields smaller values for the maintenance parameter. We also show that even when the maintenance parameter is set to zero, the model exhibits
substantially more conditional heteroscedasticity than a frictionless model.

5.1 High Elasticity of Substitution
Here we consider an alternative calibration to the one we used for the baseline model. We fix
the standard deviation of aggregate shocks at the level that is required for the frictionless model
to match the observed quarterly aggregate investment volatility in U.S. data (σ A = 0.0051) and
instead use the EIS to calibrate quarterly aggregate investment volatility. Then the maintenance
parameter is again chosen to match the heteroscedasticity range described in Section 3.1. This
procedure yields a high value of 20 for the EIS, which is better interpreted as a reduced form
parameter for the elasticity of supply of capital faced by the country rather than the elasticity
of intertemporal substitution. That is, the EIS in this model is best viewed as a reduced form
parameter that measures the strength of GE-smoothing relative to PE-smoothing, where the
latter is calibrated directly by ξ̄.23 We also report results we obtain when we apply the calibration strategy described in Section 3.1 with a value of 2 for the EIS; Gruber (2006) obtained
this estimate using careful identification based on individual tax data. Table 9 reports the main
parameters and moments associated to these calibrations.
The main point to highlight is that our alternative calibration strategy cuts the estimated
maintenance parameter in half, from 0.50 to 0.25; using the same calibration strategy with an
EIS of 2 also lowers the maintenance parameter, to a value of 0.4. The nonlinearities associated
with conditional heteroscedasticity are now reached at a lower level of maintenance. This, in
turn, raises the magnitude of both calibrated (ξ̄) and realized adjustment costs (rows three to
22

Cooper and Haltiwanger (2006) find the mode in the distribution of annual establishment level investment
rates at 0.04. With an effective annual drift of 0.104, this suggests a maintenance parameter just below 40%. Alternatively, McGrattan and Schmitz (1999) show for Canadian data that maintenance and repair expenditures for
equipment and structures amounts to roughly 30% of expenditures on new equipment and structures. This suggests just below 25% maintenance as a fraction of overall investment.

23
To implement this calibration strategy, we consider the following family of felicity functions: 1−σ
C 1−σc −
c
X 1−σc AN h , where σc is the inverse of the EIS and X the trend level of aggregate technology. The latter feature
guarantees the existence of balanced growth. In a static setting this is easy to see: employment depends on the
wage in efficiency units only and the latter is constant under balanced growth. Obviously, if σc = 1, we are back to

discount factor, whose value is kept constant across calibrations, so that β∗ is a preference parameter that changes
with σc .

six).24 Notice, however, that this rise is not due to the increase in the EIS per se — in fact,
adjustment cost statistics are largely unresponsive to changes in the EIS —, it is the change of
the maintenance parameter that causes the rise. The corresponding values for a model with
high EIS but a maintenance parameters of 0.5 are: 0.35%, 2.41%, 9.56% and 14.93%, which are
very close to the baseline scenario. For the longitudinal second moments, persistence is almost
unchanged with respect to the baseline model, but the volatilities of output, consumption and
employment have increased substantially.

The average of both bounds is now close to 70%, compared to approximately 50% for the original model. Finally, Figure 11 shows that the paths of the first element of the impulse response
function are nearly identical for the main calibration and the model obtained with the alternative calibration strategy of this section.

5.2 Nonlinearities and Zero Maintenance
Let us now return to the EIS=1 model but lower the maintenance parameter. Thus we no longer
match the heteroscedasticity range in the data, but continue to match both sectoral and aggregate investment volatilities. This configuration implies that in order to match PE-smoothing
we need to increase the size of adjustment costs. Table 11 illustrates this trade-off: to keep
roughly the same magnitude of PE-smoothing (last three columns), adjustment costs decrease
as maintenance becomes more important. This mechanism holds for any level of the EIS.
The negative correlation between adjustment costs and maintenance follows from the fact
that a higher maintenance parameter lowers the effective drift of mandated investment (since
part of depreciation is undone in each period). This is important in these models, as it implies
that the cross-section distributions of mandated investment are far from the Caplin-Spulber
uniform limit, and hence there is plenty of space for them to vary over time in response to
shocks. By contrast, without maintenance the drift dominates over microeconomic uncertainty
27

shocks and the cross section of mandated investment is closer to the Caplin and Spulber extreme where there is no PE-smoothing.25

The same reasoning explains why the volatility of the impulse response function increases
with the maintenance parameter. An increase in the latter allows for larger countercyclical fluctuations in the degree of PE-smoothing, which exacerbates the magnitude of the response of
aggregate investment to shocks in the face of an unusually long string of positive aggregate
shocks.

The main conclusion for this subsection, however, is shown in figure 12. Even with zero
maintenance the responsiveness index of the lumpy economy varies by 30% between trough
and peak (from 0.0185 to 0.0241).
25

The Caplin-Spulber model is the only Ss model where the impulse response functions do not vary over time,
see Caballero and Engel (2007) for details.

28

6 Final Remarks
We have shown that adding realistic lumpy capital adjustment at the microeconomic level to
an otherwise standard RBC model has important macroeconomic implications. In particular,
the extended model is able to match the fact that the impulse response functions of aggregate
investment, conditional on the history of shocks, varies considerably over time in US data.
The reason for this success is that, relative to the standard RBC model, in the lumpy model
investment booms feed into themselves and lead to significantly larger capital accumulation
following a string of positive shocks. Busts, on the other hand, can lead to protracted periods of
depressed investment, which are largely unresponsive to positive shocks.

Persistence parameters have the following relation between quarterly and annually: ρ q =
ρ 0.25
(the same holds true for β). For standard deviations the following relationship holds: σq =
y
σy

. For ρ S and σS the yearly parameters are primitive because of the merely annual
q
availability of sectoral data. Notice that for the yearly specification σ2S + σ2I = 0.1. Finally, the
q

1+ρ q +ρ 2q +ρ 3q

production function for quarterly output is one fourth of the one for yearly output.
The calibration of the other parameters, σ A , χ, ξ̄ and A is explained in Section 3. When we
refer in the main text to a quarterly calibration (our benchmark models), then we use – given
the quarterly parameters in the table above – σ A and ξ̄ to match jointly the standard deviation
of the quarterly aggregate investment rate (see Appendix B below) and the standard deviation
of the yearly sectoral investment rate, which is aggregated up over four quarters in the sectoral
simulations (we do not have quarterly sectoral data). This amounts to σ A = 0.0080 for the baseline lumpy model and σ A = 0.0051 for its frictionless counterpart. For the EIS=2 case we use
σ A = 0.0071. When we refer to a yearly calibration, then we use – given the yearly parameters
in the table above – σ A and ξ̄ to match jointly the standard deviation of the yearly aggregate
investment rate (see Appendix B below) and the standard deviation of the yearly sectoral investment rate. This amounts to σ A = 0.0186 for the baseline lumpy model and σ A = 0.0120
for its frictionless counterpart. The parameter that governs conditional heteroscedasticity, χ, is
calibrated only for the quarterly specifications, because we estimate conditional heteroscedasticity on quarterly aggregate data to have enough data points to detect possible nonlinearities.
The use of the EIS as a calibration object is explored in Section 5.1, but the basic principle is the
same as with the σ A -calibration.

B Data Appendix
B.1 Aggregate Data
Since they are not readily available from standard sources, we construct quarterly and yearly
series of the aggregate investment rate, based on investment data from the national account
and fixed asset tables, available from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). Time horizon for
the aggregate data is 1960-2005. The aggregate investment rate at period t is defined as:
I tr eal
eal
K tr−1

,

where the denominator is the capital stock at the end of period t −1, deflated by the investment
price index of t − 1, and the numerator is investment in period t , deflated by period t prices.
For annual investment rates we use the investment and capital data that are readily available
from the BEA. The investment data is private fixed nonresidential investment at historical costs
from fixed asset table 1.5, line 4 (this includes equipment and structures). The capital data
(in current costs, end-of-year estimates) are from table 1.1., line 4 of the fixed asset table. The
investment price index is from NIPA table 1.1.9, line 8.
For quarterly investment rates, we have to compute quarterly capital stocks, which are not
readily available. We use the following identity:
K t = K t −1 (1 + πtI ) + I t − D t ,
where all variables are nominal, πtI denotes the investment price inflation rate from period t −1
to period t , and D t depreciation in period t . Again, depreciation data are only available on an
annual basis. We make the following present value assumption:
D Q1
(1 + πQ2 )(1 + πQ3 )(1 + πQ4 )

=

D Q2
(1 + πQ3 )(1 + πQ4 )

=

D Q3
1 + πQ4

= D Q4 =

DY
.
4

With these two equations quarterly aggregate investment rates can be computed, using NIPA
tables 1.1.5 and 1.1.9, line 8, for investment and investment price data, respectively, and fixed
asset price tables 1.1. and 1.3., line 4, for capital stocks and depreciations, respectively. For
fourth quarter capital stocks, we actually use the annual end-of-year data. The quarterly investment series is available on the authors’ websites. As Figure 13 shows (the vertical lines denote
NBER business cycle dates), the aggregate investment rate does not appear to exhibit any trend,
which is why we do not filter any statistics related to it (both for real and simulated data).

B.2 Sectoral Data
For lack of sectoral data outside of manufacturing, the data source here is the NBER manufacturing data set, publicly available on the NBER website. It contains yearly 4-digit industry data
for the manufacturing sector, according to the SIC-87 classification. We look at the years 19601996, later years are not available. We take out industry 3292, the asbestos products, because
this sector essentially dies out in the nineties. This leaves us with 458 industries altogether.
Since the sectoral model analysis has to (a) be isolated from general equilibrium effects, and
(b) contain a large number of production units, we take the 3-digit level as the best compromise
aggregation level. This leaves us with 140 industries. Hence, we sum employment levels, real
capital, nominal investment and nominal value added onto the 3-digit level. The deflator for
26

The maxima are achieved in II/00 (2000), respectively, the minima in I/61 (1975).

34

investment is aggregated by a weighted sum (weighted by investment). Value added is deflated
by the GDP deflator instead of the sectoral deflators for shipments (the data do not contain
separate deflators for value added). We do this, because our model does not allow for relative
price movements between sectors, so by deflating sectoral value added with the GDP deflator
the resulting Solow residual is essentially a composite of true changes in sectoral technology
and relative price movements. Since value added and deflators are negatively correlated, we
would otherwise overestimate the volatility of sectoral innovations.27
TFP-Calculation: Since our model is about value added production as opposed to output
production—we do not model utilization of materials and energy—we do not use the TFP-series
in the data set, which are based on a production function for output. Rather, we use a production function for real value added in employment and real capital with payroll as a fraction of
value added as the employment share, and the residual as capital share, and perform a standard
Solow residual calculation for each industry separately.
Next, in order to extract the residual industry-specific and uncorrelated-with-the-aggregate
component for each industry, we regress each industry time series of logged Solow residuals on
the time series of the value added-weighted cross-sectional average of logged Solow residuals
and a constant. Since the residuals of this regression still contain sector-specific effects, but our
model features ex-ante homogenous sectors, we take out a deterministic quadratic trend on
these residuals for each sector.28 The residuals of this trend regression are then taken as the pure
sectoral Solow residual series. By construction, they are uncorrelated with the cross-sectional
average series. We then estimate an AR(1)-specification for each of these series, and set σS equal
to the value-added-weighted average of the estimated standard deviations of the corresponding
innovations, which results in σS = 0.0501, and ρ S equal to the value-added-weighted average of
the estimated first-order autocorrelation, which leads to ρ S = 0.55.
Since this computation is subject to substantial measurement error and somewhat arbitrary
choices, we perform a number of robustness checks: 1) We fix the employment share and capital
share to ν = 0.64 and θ = 0.18, as in our model parametrization for all industries. 2) Instead of
using an OLS projection onto the cross-sectional mean, we simply subtract the latter. 3) We look
at unweighted means. 4) We look at medians instead of means, again weighted and unweighted.
The resulting numbers remain in the ballpark of the parameters we use.
27

Indeed, using a weighted sum of 4-digit level value added deflators instead of the GDP deflator would increase
the standard deviation of the sectoral shock innovation from the 0.0501 we are using to 0.0564 and the persistence
of sectoral technology from 0.55 to 0.61, other things being equal. We thank Julia Thomas for this suggestion.
28
Linear trends are flat, as the regression on the manufacturing average takes essentially care of the linear component. Not de-trending the sectors would increase both persistence and the standard deviation of the sectoral
shock innovation from 0.55 to 0.65, and from 0.0501 to 0.0518, respectively. We thank Pete Klenow for this suggestion.

35

Calculation of I/K-Moments: To extract a pure sectoral component of the time series of the
industry investment rate, which like the aggregate data includes equipment and structures, we
perform the same regressions that were used for TFP-calculation, except that we use a deterministic linear trend to extract sector specific effects. We do not log or filter the investment
rate series. The common component we regress the sectoral investment rate series on is now
a capital-weighted average of the industry investment rates. Again, we perform robustness
checks with fairly stable results. The resulting standard deviation of sectoral investment rates –
our target of calibration – is 0.0163.29

C Conditional Heteroscedasticity in the Aggregate Investment
Rate
In this appendix we first present evidence for conditional heteroscedasticity in aggregate U.S.
investment to capital ratios. Then we explain how we calibrated the maintenance parameter
using this feature of the data.

C.1 Conditional Heteroscedasticity in Aggregate U.S. Investment
Denote the (demeaned) private fixed nonresidential investment to capital ratio series by x t . We
work with the 1960.I–2005.IV period and estimate the following time-series model to quantify
the extent to which this series exhibit conditional heteroscedasticity:30
x t = φx t −1 + σt e t ,

(17a)

σt = α0 + α1 x̄ tk−1 ,

(17b)

where x̄ tk−1 denotes the following estimate for “recent investment”:
x̄ tk−1 =

X
1 k−1
x t −1− j ,
k j =0

and the e t are i.i.d. with zero mean and variance equal to one. Of course, the first element of
the impulse response of x t to e t -shocks is equal to σt , thereby illustrating the close connection
between conditional heteroscedasticity and time-varying impulse response functions.
29

Their persistence is 0.55.
α0 and α1 must satisfy conditions that ensure that σt defined below is positive for all t . For example, a well
know result in the ARCH literatrue is that for k = 1 this condition is φ2 + α21 < 1.
30

36

The models with lumpy adjustment developed in this paper (and earlier models such as
Caballero and Engel (1999)) predict that fitting the above time-series model to aggregate investment data will lead to a positive and economically significant value for the parameter α1 .
The reason is that in these models the cross-section of mandated investment concentrates in
a region with a steeper likelihood of adjusting when recent investment has been high, which
implies that investment becomes more responsive to shocks during these times.
To estimate the parameters of the time-series model (17a)-(17b), we first regress x t on its
lagged value and then regress the absolute residual from this regression, denoted by |ê t | in what
follows, on x̄ tk−1 (both regressions are estimated via OLS).31 The second regression then looks
like
|ê t | = α̂0 + α̂1 x̄ tk−1 + error,
and provides estimates for α0 and α1 .
Table 14 presents the estimates we obtain for values of k ranging from 1 to 7. The standard
deviations are calculated based on 10,000 bootstrap simulations and reported in parentheses.
Since the bootstrap simulations generate a significant fraction of large estimates for the parameter that captures conditional heteroscedasticity, α1 , leading to a standard deviation that overstates the case against α1 being positive, we also report the fraction of bootstrap simulations
that generate a negative estimate for α1 . This fraction is the p-value for rejecting the one-sided
hypothesis α1 > 0. For six out of the seven values of k we consider, this p-value is below the
classic 5% threshold, in three cases it is below 2%. More important, the estimated conditional
heteroscedasticity schedule (17b) implies economically significant variations in σt over time.
Thus, for example, the ratio of the largest and smallest values for σt when k = 1 is 1.49.

To limit the influence of outliers on our estimates, we work with the absolute residual instead of the squared
residual. The estimates we obtain are essentially the same if we work with the squared residuals.

37

The time series model (17a)-(17b) is a particularly simple and robust approach to test for
the presence of conditional heteroscedasticity. More sophisticated options can be used as well.
For example, instead of assuming the linear relation (17b) we could allow for a more general
expression of the form σt = h(x̄ tk−1 ), where h is a smooth increasing function. Figure 1 in the
introduction plots the estimate we obtain for h (normalized by the average fitted value for σt )
using k = 5,32 a Gaussian kernel and cross-validation to determine the appropriate bandwidth.

C.2 Calibrating the Maintenance Parameter
To choose parameter values that match the heteroscedasticity present in aggregate U.S. investment series, it is useful to summarize the estimated conditional heteroscedasticity schedule
(17b) by one statistic. We do this via the signed log-ratio statistic, which we refer to as the heteroscedasticity range. We calculate this statistic as follows: The absolute value of this statistic is
the log-ratio of the largest and smallest fitted values for the conditional heteroscedasticity regression (17b), when k = 1. The sign of the statistic is positive if the estimated slope is positive
and negative otherwise. In this way we obtain one statistic that captures, simultaneously, the
magnitude and sign of heteroscedastic behavior in lumpy adjustment models.
Table 15 reports estimates for the first moment of the range statistic for the models we consider throughout the paper. For each parameter configuration we generate a time-series of aggregate investment to capital ratios of the same length as the U.S. investment series we work
with in the preceding subsection. We then estimate the range statistic for this series (we simulated a sequence of 10,000 observations for each parameter configuration, which leads to 54
series of length 184).
The first row in Table 15 reports the range statistics for the main model discussed in sections
3.2 and 4, that is, the model where we impose an EIS of 1. The first column reports the value
for the range statistic in the actual U.S. investment series. The second column reports the value
for a model where capital can be adjusted at no cost. Columns 3 through 9 consider various
values for the maintenance parameter, in each case the simulated model matches perfectly
the volatility of sectoral and aggregate investment. It follows from the first row that our models
with lumpy adjustment match the conditional heteroscedasticity in the actual data much better
than a frictionless model. It also follows from the first row that a maintenance parameter of 0.50
generates a first moment of 0.4008 for the range statistic, which is close to the estimated value
of 0.3971. We therefore choose χ = 0.50 in this case.
The second row reports a similar exercise when the value of the EIS is set to 2 instead of
1. This time χ = 0.40 provides the best fit among the values of the maintenance parameter we

Which corresponds to the lowest p-value in Table 14.

consider. Finally, the third row considers the calibration strategy followed in Section 5.1, where
the elasticity of intertemporal substitution is among the parameters used to match the selected
data moments. In this case the best match of the range statistic is provided by the model with
χ = 0.25.

D Numerical Appendix
In this appendix, we describe in detail the numerical implementation of the model computation. Unless otherwise stated, the numerical specifications refer to the baseline calibration in
the main text, although most of them are common across all models.

D.1 Decision Problem
Given the assumptions we made in the main paper: 1) ρ S = ρ I = ρ, and 2) approximating the
distribution µ by the aggregate capital stock, k̄, the dynamic programming problem has a 4dimensional state space: (k, k̄, z, ²). Since the employment problem has an analytical solution,
there is essentially just one continuous control, k 0 . We discretize the state space as follows:
1. k: n k = 35 grid points from [0, 7.5], with a lower grid width at low capital levels, where the
curvature of the value function is highest.
2. k̄ : n k̄ = 13 grid points in [0.8, 1.4], equi-spaced.
3. z : n z = 11 grid points in [0.92, 1.08] with closer grid points around unity. For the GaussHermitian integration (see Judd, 1998) we use 7 integration nodes.
4. ²: n ² =q19. The grid points are equi-spaced (in logs) and the total grid width is given
σ2
by 3 × 1−ρ
2 , the unconditional variance of the combined technology process. For the
transition matrix we use the procedure proposed in Tauchen (1986).
39

We note that for all partial equilibrium computations the dimension of the state space collapses to three, k̄ is no longer needed to compute prices and aggregate movements. Instead,
we follow KT in fixing the intertemporal price and the real wage at their average levels from the
general equilibrium simulations.
Since we allow for a continuous control, k, and k̄ and z can take on any value continuously,
we can only compute the value function exactly at the grid points above and interpolate for
in-between values. This is done by using a multidimensional cubic splines procedure, with a
so-called “not-a-knot”-condition to address the large number of degrees of freedom problem,
when using splines (see Judd, 1998). We compute the solution by value function iteration, using 20 steps of policy improvement after each actual optimization procedure. The optimum is
found by using a golden section search. Upon convergence, we check single-peakedness of the
objective function, to guarantee that the golden section search is reasonable.

D.2 Equilibrium Simulation
For the calibration of the general equilibrium models we draw one random series for the aggregate technology level and fix it across models. We use T = 600 and discard the first 100 observations. For computing the conditional heteroscedasticity in the model simulations we use a
much longer simulation horizon of T = 10000. We find that, generally, the statistics are robust to
T . We start from an arbitrary individual capital distribution and the stationary distribution for
the combined productivity level. The model economies typically settle fast into their stochastic
steady state after roughly 50 observations. Since with idiosyncratic shocks, adjustment costs
and necessary maintenance some production unit may not adjust for a very long time, we take
out any individual capital stock in the distribution that has a marginal weight below 10−10 , in
order to save on memory. We re-scale the remaining distribution proportionally.
As in the production unit’s decision problem, we use a golden section search to find the
optimal target capital level, given p. We find the market clearing intertemporal price, using a
combination of bisection, secant and inverse quadratic interpolation methods. Precision of the
market-clearing outcome is better than 10−7 .
To further assess the quality of the assumed log-linear equilibrium rules, we perform the
following simulation: for each point in the T = 500 (we discard the first 100 observations) time
series, we iterate for a time series of T̃ = 100 aggregate capital and the intertemporal price forward, using only the equilibrium rules and assuming the actual time path for aggregate technology. We then compare the aggregate capital and p after T̃ steps with the actually simulated
ones, when the equilibrium price was updated at each step. We then compute maximum absolute percentage deviations, mean squared percentage deviations, and the correlation between

the simulated values and the out-of-sample forecasts. Tables 16 and 17 summarize the numerical results for each model. The rows contain: the coefficients of the log-linear regression, its R 2
and standard error and the three above measures that assess the out-of-sample quality of the
equilibrium rules. They assess the log-linear approximation for future capital and current p, respectively. Baseline-SKEW refers to our baseline calibration, where agents use additionally the
log standard deviation and skewness of the capital distribution for forecasting, and High-EISSKEW does the same for our high EIS=20 calibration with a maintenance parameter of χ = 0.25.
Table 16 shows that there exists a good log-linear approximation for aggregate capital as a
function of last period’s capital and the current aggregate shock. This may seem surprising in
light of the time-varying impulse response functions we described in the main text. However,
the numbers also show that in particular out-of-sample forecasts improve, when higher moments of the capital distribution are introduced, in particular for the high EIS calibration. Fur41

thermore, as we argue next, the goodness-of-fit for an equation analogous to (11a) and (11b),
but with the aggregate investment rate as the dependent variable, is less good, even though the
poorer fit has no bearing on aggregate investment dynamics.

We simulated a series of 500 observations for our baseline model and the high EIS calibration, assuming that agents use the first, the first two and the first three moments of capital
in their forecasting rules.33 We divided the simulated series into quartiles based on the magnitude of the actual investment rate, and calculated, for each quartile, the R 2 -goodness-of-fit
statistic between the aggregate investment rate series implied by the forecasting rule and the
“true”aggregate investment rate series, which we assume to be the one generated, when agents
use three moments of the capital distribution for forecasting.
Table 18 shows our results. The average (across quartiles) R 2 between the log-linear approximation and the true investment rate is only 0.85 for the baseline model and 0.64 for the high EIS
model. This average increases to 0.99 (0.97) when the log-standard-deviation of capital is added
as a regressor, and to well above 0.99 when the skewness statistic is included as well.34 The last
two columns of Table 18 show that the estimated first and second order autocorrelations of the
investment rate also improve significantly when using higher moments in the forecasting rules:
the corresponding values for the actual investment rate series are 0.919 and 0.842, respectively,
for the baseline calibration, and 0.923 and 0.850, respectively, for the high EIS calibration.
We also recomputed the aggregate evolution of the aggregate investment rate, when agents
use the rules that include higher moments of capital, and found no discernible differences
with what we obtained with the log-linear forecasting rules: the correlation coefficient between
33

More precisely, the first case has the log-mean of capital holdings as a regressor, the second case adds the
log-standard deviation and the third case also incorporates the skewness of capital holdings. Of course, log z t is a
regressor in all cases.
34
For the frictionless model the first part of the first row would read: 0.9981, 0.9887, 0.9774, 0.9796, 0.9841, 0.9825.
And the autocorrelations for forecasted investment rates are almost identical to the ones for the actual series.

42

the sample paths of I /K generated with forecasting rules with and without higher moments is
above 0.9999.35

D.3 Sectoral Simulation
Underlying the sectoral simulation are four assumptions: first, a large enough number of sectors and, secondly, that σS is large enough relative to σ A , so that we can compute the sectoral
implications of our model independently of the aggregate general equilibrium calculations.
This is also reflected in our treatment of the sectoral data as residual values, which are uncorrelated with aggregate components. Thirdly, we make use of the assumption that a sector is large
enough to comprise a large number of production units by invoking a law of large numbers now
for the true idiosyncratic productivity. Finally, ρ S = ρ I , and the independence of sectoral and
the idiosyncratic productivity, so that we can treat sectoral and truly idiosyncratic uncertainty
as one state variable in the general equilibrium problem.
We start by fixing the aggregate technology level at its average level: z SS = 1. The converged
equilibrium law of motion for aggregate capital can then be used to compute the steady state
aggregate capital level that belongs to this aggregate productivity. It is the fixed point of the
aggregate law of motion, evaluated at z SS :
k̄ SS ≡ exp

a k̄
1 − b k̄

.

This, in turn, leads to the steady state p SS ≡ exp(a p + b p log(k̄ SS )).
Then we specify a separate grid for idiosyncratic and sectoral productivity in such a way that
all new grid points and any product of them will lie on the original 19-state grid for the combined productivity, used in the general equilibrium problem. Given the equi-spaced (in logs)
nature of the combined grid this is obviously possible. Thus, the idiosyncratic grid comprises
11 grid points, and the sectoral grid 9 grid points, both equi-spaced and centered around unity.
We then recompute optimal target capital levels as well as gross values of investment (see
equation 12d) at z SS , k̄ SS , at the 19 values for ². By construction, these are then also the values
for any (²S , ²I )-combination. Note that we use the value functions computed from the general equilibrium case. We draw a random series of T = 2600 for ²S , which remains fixed across
all models, start from an arbitrary capital distribution and the stationary distribution for the
35
Based on this result, when computing the R 2 mentioned in the preceding paragraph, we used the actual series
that results when agents use the first three moments of capital as the “true”series. There are no significant differences in Table 18, if we use the actual series that results when agents only use the first, or the first two moments.

43

idiosyncratic technology level, and follow the behavior of this representative sector, using the
sectoral policy rules. The details are similar to those of the equilibrium simulation.
Finally, we test the two main assumptions on which we base our sectoral computations:
a continuum of sectors and fixing the aggregate environment at its steady state level. To this
end, we compute the equilibrium with a finite number of sectors, NS . Also, we introduce an
P
additional state-variable, given by: ²̄S,t ≡ i =1,...,NS log(²S,t (i )), which captures changes in the
aggregate environment, beyond the common aggregate shock. Obviously, ²̄S,t = 0, ∀ t , as NS →
∞, by the law of large numbers and assuming sectoral independence. This additional aggregate
state is then integrated over by Gauss-Hermitian integration, which is facilitated by the fact
that the ²̄S,t -process is independent of the aggregate technology process (by assumption). For
computational reasons - following a large number of sectors with a large number of production
units each is considerably more onerous in a quarterly calibration than in a yearly calibration -,
we run these robustness checks for the annual equivalents of our baseline models.
We choose two different values for NS . First, 400, which roughly equals the number of 3digit SIC-87 sectors in the US (395). Since, however, sectors are of very different size and overall
importance, and also often correlated, we decrease, secondly, NS to 100 for robustness reasons.
The resulting residual σ²̄S is 0.0026 and 0.0052, respectively. Notice that in both cases σ²̄S is
considerably smaller than σ A = 0.0120, the σ A for the annual frictionless calibration, so that we
should not expect too large an effect from this additional source of aggregate uncertainty.
Of course, in order to make the computation viable, we have to scale down the numerical
specification of the computation, in particular the grid lengths. The grid length for the additional aggregate shock is 7, equi-spaced, between [−0.03, 0.03] for NS = 100, and [−0.015, 0.015]
for NS = 400. We use 5 nodes for both continuous aggregate shocks in the Gauss Hermitian
integration.
The following table shows the aggregate and sectoral standard deviations for annual investment rates for the frictionless model and our baseline lumpy model (χ = 0.5). The raw sectoral
standard deviations are shown as a capital-weighted average (the unweighted averages are only
insignificantly different). The residual sectoral standard deviations are shown with the same
filtering operations as discussed in Appendix B.2.

The first important observation is that the numbers obtained here are not much different
from what we have obtained in the simplified computation, which is in particular true for the
lumpy model. Specifically, the frictionless model continues to fail to match observed sectoral
volatility by an order of magnitude. And, secondly, the numbers deviate in the expected direction: the aggregate standard deviation increases (from 0.0098), because there is an additional
aggregate shock, but only slightly so; the sectoral standard deviations decrease a little bit (from

our simplified sectoral simulations seem justified.

E Matching Establishment Statistics
One argument we used to justify the use of sectoral rather than plant level data to calibrate micro frictions, is that there are many determinants of plant level moments which are less relevant
for the macro dimensions we are concerned with. In this appendix we provide support to this
claim by showing that minor modifications of the micro underpinnings of the model we presented in the main text can lead to a satisfactory match of establishment level moments as well.
More importantly, the match of sectoral and aggregate moments we obtained in the main text
are unaffected by the extension we develop next.

E.1 A Simple Extension
A first choice we need to make when matching the model to micro data is to decide how many
micro units in the model correspond to one establishment. Choices by other authors have covered a wide range, going from one to a number large enough—sometimes a continuum—so
that adding additional units makes no difference.36
Two additional issues arise if we choose to model an establishment as the aggregation of
many micro units. First, we must address the extent to which shocks—both to productivity and
to adjustment costs—are correlated across units within an establishment.37 Second, we must
take a stance on the fact that establishments sell off and buy what in our model corresponds to
one or more micro units.
36

Cooper and Haltiwanger (2005) and KT are examples of the former; Abel and Eberly (2002) and Bloom (2007)
of the latter.
37
For tractability, all models assume that decisions are made at the micro-unit level, not the establishment level.

45

Next we present a simple model that incorporates both elements mentioned above. The
economy is composed of sectors (indexed by s), which are composed of establishments (indexed by e), which are composed of units (indexed by u). The log-productivity shock faced by
unit u in establishment e in sector s at time t is decomposed into aggregate, sectoral, establishment and unit level shocks as follows:
log z uest = log εtA + log εSst + log εFest + log εU
uest ,
where log εtA ∼ AR(1; ρ A , σ A ), log εSst ∼ AR(1; ρ S , σS ), log εFest ∼ AR(1; ρ E , σE ) and log εU
uest ∼
AR(1; ρU , σU ).38,39 Consistent with the assumptions we made in the paper, we assume ρ S =
ρ E = ρU and denote the common value by ρ.
An establishment is composed of a large number (continuum) of units. The extent to which
the behavior of units within an establishment is correlated will depend on the relative importance of σU and σE . The larger σE , the larger the correlation of productivity shocks across units
within an establishment and the more coordinated their investment decisions will be. We consider two extreme scenarios for the degree of correlation of adjustment cost shocks across units
within an establishment: perfect correlation and independence.
The sectoral and aggregate investment series generated by this model will be the same as
2
those generated by the model we developed in the main text as long as σ2E +σU
= σ2I , since all we

are doing in this extension is grouping micro units into groups we call “establishments”, which
has no implication for sectoral aggregates. We therefore can decompose σ2I into the sum of
2
σU
and σ2E as we please, without affecting sectoral and aggregate statistics. We define ζ ∈ [0, 1]
2
via σU
= ζσ2I , so that σ2E = (1 − ζ)σ2I . Productivity shocks are the same across units within an

establishment when ζ = 0, their correlation decreases as ζ increases.
Regarding the sale and purchase of micro units, we assume that in every period an establishment with capital K est suffers a sales/purchase shock τest , so that its capital becomes
(1 + τest )K est . The τ’s are i.i.d. draws from a zero mean symmetric distribution with standard
deviation στ . We consider two possibilities, a standard normal distribution and a t -distribution
with one degree of freedom. Since the sectors in our model are composed of a continuum
of establishments, our choice of a distribution with zero mean for purchase/sales shocks ensures that sectoral and aggregate statistics are unaffected by this extension as well. We choose
a symmetric distribution so that asymmetries in the histogram of investment rates cannot be
38

x t ∼ AR(1; ρ, σ) means that the process x t follows an AR(1) with first order autocorrelation ρ and standard
deviation of innovations equal to σ.
39
Sectoral innovations are independent across sectors and independent from the innovations of the aggregate
shock. Establishment level innovations are independent across establishments and independent from the innovations of the aggregate and sectoral shocks. Finally, unit level innovations are independent across units and independent from the innovations of the aggregate, sectoral and establishment-level shocks.

46

attributed to this choice.
We denote by i˜est the investment rate for a given establishment according to our model,
and by i est the corresponding investment rate recorded by the LRD. The latter differs from the
former in that it includes the sale/purchase of units from other establishments, which is ignored
in our original model. We then have:
i est = (1 − τest )i˜est − τest (1 − δ).

(18)

Summing up, our (admittedly simple) extension introduces two parameters over which we
can optimize to fit establishment level moments without affecting the match of sectoral and
aggregate statistics. These parameters are the degree to which productivity shocks are correlated across units within an establishment, and the average magnitude of sales and purchases
of micro units across establishments.

E.2 Matching Establishment Level Statistics
We work with χ = 0.5. For a fixed value of ζ, we generate a histogram with 2,500 realizations of
establishment level I /K using our model.40
Denote by f i , i = 1, ..., 5 the fraction of LRD establishments that adjusted less than −20%,
between −20 and −1%, between −1% and 1%, between 1 and 20% and above 20%, respectively. And denote by πi (στ ) the fraction of units with adjustment in the previous bins after applying the transformation described in (18). We choose the value of στ that minimizes
P
i | f i − πi (στ )|/ f i , that is, we minimize the absolute relative error.
Table 20 presents our results. It also presents the values obtained by KT.41 We consider all
possible combinations (2x2x2=8) of calibration strategies (the one described in section 3 imposing EIS=1 and the one that calibrates the EIS used in section 5.1), correlation among adjustment
costs across units within a firm (0 or 1) and the shape of the distribution of sales and acquisition
of units (normal or t-distribution). As can be seen, our model does a reasonable job matching
the micro statistics which have been considered earlier in the literature. In fact, our fit is within
the ballpark of the fit obtained by KT. Also, even though we optimize over ζ ∈ [0, 1], the statistics
we obtain vary relatively little with ζ (the maximum, over ζ, average absolute deviation exceeds
the minimum value by more than 20% for only one of the eight cases considered).

40

We compute these investment rates using the approximation described in Appendix D.3 with σ2S + σ2E in the
role of σ2S , and σ2I − σ2E in the role of σ2I .
41
Recall that f 1 , f 2 , f 3 , f 4 and f 5 represent the fraction of establishments with I /K less than −20%, between −20
and −1%, between −1 and 1%, between 1 and 20% and above 20%, respectively.

The factor (1 − θ − ν) is included so that the index is approximately one when no sources of
smoothing are present. More precisely, in a static, partial equilibrium setting, with no time-tobuild, micro units solve:42
max zk θ n ν − ωn − k,

leading to the following optimal capital target level as a function of aggregate technology:
k ∗ = C z 1/(1−θ−ν) ,
where C is a constant that depends on the wage and the technology parameters. Taking logs

For notational simplicity we leave out idiosyncratic and sectoral shocks.
