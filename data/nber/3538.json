Section 3 offers a different solution and demonstrates that it supports an efficient allocation of resources. Section 4 briefly discusses some of the complications that arise in practice, analyzes methods governments have employed to address this problem, and argues that the solution corresponds to concepts of income division that governments have tried to employ in broader contexts.\n\n",
