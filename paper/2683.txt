NEWS AND THE DOLLAR/YEN EXCHANGE RATE, 1931-1933:
THE END OF THE GOLD STANDARD, IMPERIALISM, AND THE GREAT DEPRESSION

ABSTRACT

According to the efficient market hypothesis, news in Tokyo is
responsible for the exchange rate changes during the Tokyo market hours,
while the U.S. news is responsible for changes in the New York hours.

The

intra-daily dynamics of the $/yen exchange rate from December 1931 to
November 1933 is analyzed. Japan's decision to go off gold in December 1931
depreciated yen by 30% in a month, mostly in the Tokyo market. During 1932,

the yen depreciated another 30%, mainly due to Japan's aggression in China

and resulting diplomatic isolation. In 1933, the yen appreciated against
the dollar, mainly in the New York market, due to the U.S. decision to go

off gold.

However, exchange rate volatility and its sensitivity to news

declined over the two year period, because of increasing capital controls.

Changes in the interest rate differential was found insignificant for the
changes in the exchange rate. Political regime changes, such as a decision
to go off gold, most influenced the exchange rate for the period considered.
There were no policy decisions by Japan to cause yen depreciation to promote
export and limit import in 1931-33.

Introduction

This paper considers the news and its effects on the dollar/yen
exchange rate from December 1931 to November 1933. The intra-daily data,
i.e. ,

the Tokyo and New York quotes of the day, are analyzed for the two

year period, so that sources of the rapid exchange rate change can be better
identified.

The investigation of exchange rate dynamics during this period is
important for at least three reasons. First, it was the time that the
exchange rate moved most for a short period of time. By identifying the
factors affecting rapid depreciation, we gain insights into determinants of

the exchange rate during the interwar period. Second, by analyzing the
intra-daily data, it is possible to infer how efficient the international

financial markets were during the interwar period. Third, the rapid yen
depreciation in this period is often credited for the fast recovery of the

Japanese economy after the depression of 1929-31. It is interesting to
investigate whether the depreciation was planned for the concurrent and
subsequent export drive or it was a result of market force.

In order to accomplish the objectives a news (event) analysis is
employed.

If the market is efficient, relevant news is reflected in the

asset price, or the exchange rate in this case, within minutes of its
revelation.

It is also reasonable to assume, at least for the first

approximation, that relevant news concerning the economic and political
events in Japan are revealed during the Japanese market hours, and those in

the U.S. are revealed during the U.S. market hours. Because of the time
difference between Tokyo and New York, business hours of the two markets do
not overlap. By recording the closing quotes of the two markets in the same
day,

it is possible to identify which market was more responsible for the

1

exchange rate changes, and hence to infer the origin of the news relevant to

the changes. This method has been successfully

employed for the period from

1980 to 1985 by Ito and Roley (1986), and for a one-year period after the
Group of Five Plaza Agreement by Ito (1987). Including these studies, there
have been many studies of exchange rate dynamics after

1973, but this paper

is a first attempt, to the best of our knowledge, that investigate the
dynamics of the intra-daily exchange rate during the floating exchange rate
regime of the interwar period.

2. Background

From 1874 to

1897, the yen depreciate from about $100/100

yen to

$50/100 yen. The yen was on the gold standard from 1897 to 1917.

During

the l920s, many European countries restored the gold standard, and Japan

attempted to restore the gold standard.

These countries restored (or

attempted to restore) the exchange rate at the "prewar (old) parity," the
rate prevailing before the First World War."1"

This is one of the reasons

that European countries and Japan experienced a decade of stagnant,
deflationary economy. (See Figure 1 for the dollar/yen exchange rate up to
the Second World War.)

Insert FIGURE 1 about here

In Japan, the Great Kanto Earthquake of September 1923 and the
F-inancjal Panic of March 1927 were also marks of the troubled l920s.

In

July 1929, Junnosuke Inouye became the Finance Minister of the Hamaguchi
cabinet.

He introduced a deflationary policy in order to restore the gold

standard for the yen, a stated goal of the cabinet. There was no bond
financing for the general budget of 1930, for the first time since 1907.

1930, and decreased 5.2 percent from 1930 to 1931.

to

The gold standard of

yen, which was called "the resumption of gold export" in Japan, was restored

in January 11, 1930. The value of yen had risen from $43/l0O yen before the

announcement of intention to restore the gold standard in 1929 to $49/100
yen in December 1929.

In addition to the deflationary policies, other external events, such
as the agricultural crisis of 1930, and the decline in export to the U.S.
following the U.S. stock market crash of October 1929, worsened the economic

performance of Japan. For a two-year period from 1929 to 1931, the price of
all farm goods declined by 39 percent, the Wholesale Price Index declined

by

30 percent, and real Gross Domestic Fixed Capital Formation declined by 12
percent.

At the same time, the real GNP stalled (to be precise, increased

by 1.5 percent in two years) and real export increased by only 6.7 percent

over the two years. However, the economic situation from 1929 to 1931 in
Japan was much better than the United States, where real income dropped by
19 percent for the same period (and was still on its way down), and it was
much worse in the 1921-23 recession in Japan when the real GNP dropped by 7
percent.

On September 21, 1931, British sterling went off gold, and the pound
immediately depreciated. Many European countries followed suit:

Denmark,

Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland left the gold standard within a week after

Britain's decision, as did Finland in October. In September 1931, Japan
started to invade Manchuria. These events created strong pressure to invest

in U.S. dollars. The Yokohama Shokin Bank, the predecessor of the Bank of
Tokyo and the official bank for foreign exchange, met all the buy orders of
dollars by taking sell positions. However, in order to settle the position,

3

the bank later needed transport species abroad. At the end of 1929, shortly

before the return to the gold standard, the amount of gold reserves in the
Bank of Japan was 1,072 million yen. By the end of 1931, shortly after the

gold embargo, the gold reserve was reduced to 470 million yen, less than
half of the level two years earlier. (Bank of

Japan (1985, p.71).)

though the effect of the yen depreciation of 1931-1932 on the

Japanese recovery is an interesting topic of investigation, it is beyond the

scope of this paper. (For European economies, see Eighengreen and Sachs
(1985) for the effect of exchange rates on the economic recovery.) Instead,
we will investigate whether the yen depreciation was engineered as a policy

objective or determined in the efficient market.

3. Data and Definitions
The closing rate of the exchange rate (in units of dollars per 100 yen)

in the Tokyo and New York markets are collected daily from newspaper, cai

Shogyo Shinpo from December 1, 1931 to November 30, 1933."" The Japanese
Standard Time (JST) is fourteen hours ahead of the Eastcoast Standard Time
(EST).

Tokyo is the first major market to open in a day. It opens a few

hours after closing of the New York market of the preceding day.

Since

there is no major market or news coming out between the New York closing and

the Tokyo opening, the Tokyo opening can

well approximated by the New

York closing quote. (See Ito and Roley (1987) for the validity of this
claim in the 1980s.) When the Tokyo market closes, the Shanghai and Indian
markets are still open, and the London market opens in a few hours after the

Tokyo market closes.

The late afternoon session of the London market

overlaps for a few hours with the morning session of the New York market.

We define the change in the Tokyo market on day t, TOKYO(T) as the
change from the New York close of day T-l, NYDY(T-1), to the Tokyo close,
TKDY(T), and the change in the New York market, NYORK(T), is defined as the
change from the Tokyo close to the New York close of the day.
TOKYO(T)

TKDY(T) - NYDY(T-l)

NYORK(T)

NYDY(T) - TKDY(T).

Note that in this definition, the New York market includes changes in the
Indian and European markets, too. Whenever the New York market is mentioned
in the rest of this paper, this proviso applies.

For purposes of comparison, the 24-hour change in New York, NYORK24(T),
is also defined and used.

NYORK24(T) — NYDY(T)-NYDY(T-1)

The advantage of having the intra-daily data over the daily data will be

5

evident from considering the information contents of the TOKYO and NYORK

decornpsition

compared with NYORK24.

The call rate in Tokyo, TKR. and the call rate in New York,

NYR, are

also collected from the same source. The interest differential between

the

two countries is defined as,
INTDIF(T)

NYR(T)-TKR(T).

If capital flows attracted by the interest rate differential were a
major determinant of the exchange rate changes in the i930s, like the

case

in the l980s, then the interest rate differential should explain the
exchange rate changes. This conjecture will be tested in section 8.

The daily exchange rate (the New York quote) from December

1931 to

November 1933 is plotted in Figure 2, and the summary statistics including
the decomposed market changes are shown in Table 1.

Insert Figure 2a, 2b and Table I about here

Observe, first, that a rapid change in the exchange rate came in various
waves (regimes), A wave of rapid changes was followed by a relatively calm

period before another wave of changes. This pattern is common to the post

Bretton Woods experiences.6 Theoretically, a regime of yen depreciation
(or appreciation) should correspond to a bunch of news relevant to the
exchange rate determinations

Second, the yen depreciated by about $30/100

yen in one year following the gold embargo, and then stabilized around
$2l/lOOyen for several months. After the U.S. went off gold, the yen slowly

appreciated by $10/laO yen in several months. Thus, in net over the two
year period, the yen depreciated by $19/lao yen. Clearly, a different force

on the value of yen appeared in 1933. Third, the geographical source of

6

major disturbances shifted from Asia to the United States over the two years

of our sample. The standard deviation in the Tokyo market was larger than

in the New York market for one year following the Japanese gold embargo.
However, from December 1932 to November 1933, the volatility of the New York
market exceeded that of the Tokyo market.

As indicated in figures, various regimes are identified over the two
year period. In most cases, when. a regime started and ended is clearcut/7''

Table 2 is a statistical summary of changes in the dollar/yen exchange rate

for each regime. In the following sections, each regime will be examined
closely.

4. Regime I: Takahashi's Decision to Go Off the Gold Standard

In the three weeks starting on December 11, 1931 (Regime 1), the yen

depreciated by about 30 percent. In fact, there were two phases in this
regime. First, the drop occurred immediately before and after December 13,

the day the yen went off gold. Second, the yen depreciated for three days
starting December 27 apparently with no significant news.

When the cabinet collapsed on December 11 citing the "incompatibility"
within the cabinet, there was widespread anticipation that the yen would go

off gold.

On that day, the leading business newspaper began a serial of

articles about what would happen to the economy if gold exports were
suspended, and the market was reasonably certain that this would occur.
However, there was great uncertainty about the political future and trading

on the Tokyo exchange virtually came to a standstill.

On December 12,

another large drop in quotes in the Tokyo market was recorded. We may
conclude that a drop in the value of yen from $48 to $40 over ten days from

7

December 11 was a direct reaction to the (anticipations of) a

gold embargo.

The source of disturbances was clearly in the Tokyo market and
revealed by statistics.

so was

In fact, most of the drop of the yen occurred

before the forthcoming announcement of the gold embargo. This is

evidence

in support of the view that markets were efficient and expectations were
rational in the beginning of the 1930s.

Another drop of $5/100 yen at the end of the month was caused with no

new information. It is not obvious why the yen depreciated on December 28

(in Tokyo) and on December 29 (in New York). The drop on December 28,
according to newspapers, was due to speculations. For example, due to the
anticipated decline in the yen, importers of (raw) cotton hastened the

deal

(i.e., a classical case of leads). The newspaper on December 30,

1931

carried an article written in New York about the drop on December 29 in the

New York market which said that "Bankers and financial experts cannot find

particular causes for the crash of the yen." Since there are instances in

which large movements in the exchange rate

cannot be associated with

significant news events even in the 1980s, it is not surprising to find an
episode of a speculative attack in the 1930s.

5 Adventures in Imperialism and the Yen's Depreciation in Early 1932

During the first month and a half of 1932 (Regime Q-I), the

exchange market was volatile, although the depreciation,

foreign

which mainly

happened in Tokyo, and appreciation, which mainly happened in New York,

cancelled each other out. In February and June, there were waves of yen
depreciation, which were results of Japan's aggressions in China, which drew
criticism from the rest of the world.

Although Japanese imperialism started earlier, its speed of aggression
8

accelerated during the year of 1932, In January and February, Japan
attacked Shianghai.

In March, Manchuria became "independent" with a

government many western nations regarded as a puppet of the Japanese
military.

When these conflicts developed, the yen depreciated.

In

particular, a sharp decline on January 29 was a response to the Japanese
attack on Shianghai on January 28. These aggressions took place during the
Tokyo market hours, thus causing a yen depreciation in the Tokyo market. In
a few instances, signs of truce caused the yen to appreciate (for example,
on February 29 and March 10).

In January, depreciation occurred in the Tokyo market, responding to

the news of the attack on Shianghai combined with the fear of losing the

Chinese market for export. However, the depreciation was countered by
appreciation in the New York market. The news of the Japanese aggression
might not have been taken seriously enough in New York, and the dollar was

weakening with the news of the troubled U.S. economy (to be discussed in
detail shortly).

From the middle to the end of February, the yen depreciated by $4/lOO

yen (Regime II).

This reflects the reaction of foreign investors to

increasing political criticism of the Japanese activities in Shianghai and
Manchuria. On February 16, the League of Nations adopted an appeal to Japan

on the issue of the Shianghai incidents, and a fact-finding mission was
dispatched by the League of Nations, arriving at Japan on February 29. Most

yen depreciation this time occurred in the New York market.

This is

evidence that foreign governments' reaction to the Japanese military
adventures were the key to the yen depreciation. Let us elaborate on this
conclusion.

9

Newspapers reported that major sellers of yen against dollars (in New
York) were American banks, while the Japanese banks sold dollars for profit-

taking, although the pressure of selling yen dominated buying yen.

(Chugai

Shogyo Sinpo, February 26, 1932.) It was also reported that the loss of
reputation made it difficult for Japan to issue, or rollover, the dollar-

denominated bonds issued abroad.

It seemed that American investors were

more informed about the determination of the U.S. government to penalize
Japan for her military adventures in China.

In the U.S., the Great Depression was in progress.

New York stock

prices lost 40-50 percent of their value in the first half of the year. The

government countered with measures to inflate the money supply. The fear of

possible inflation caused the European investors to pull their investments

from the United States. The net flow of gold out of the U.S. amounted to
623 million dollars, making the balance at the end of June at 3.92 billion
dollars. This large outflow of gold prompted rumors of the gold embargo
the U.S., for example, on March 29, and depreciated the dollar against

by
yen.

However, these events were dominated by the yen depreciation news mentioned
above.

The Japanese political instability in the 1930s was twofold.

As

mentioned above, international criticism of Japanese aggressions in China
was a great factor in yen depreciation. However, there were other domestic

disturbances in Japan.

There were several political assassinations in

Japan. On February 9, ex-Finance Minister Inouye was assassinated; on March

5, Mituj Zajbatsu executive Takuma Dan was assassinated; and on May 15,

Prime Minister Inukai was assassinated. However, the domestic

political

instability did not cause an immediate sharp change in the value of

yen.

The exchange rate did not show any significant movement on February 9 or 10,

10

and the assassination of the Prime Minister caused a yen depreciation of
only a small amount (less than by $1) temporarily on May 16.

New Prime Minister Saito formed an all-party coalition government on
May 26 and called a special parliamentary session from June 1 to June 15.

The special session passed, among others, the Act of Preventing Capital
Flight [Shihon Tohi Boshi HoJ (which became effective on July 1).

However, the parliamentary session was followed by another wave of yen
depreciations (Regime III). This time, according to newspapers, speculators

in Shianghai were to blame, combined with hightened political instability
caused by a conflict at the Manchurian customs office (on June 27).

The

drop in yen might also have been hastened by import leads (of cotton) and by

speculations which tried to avoid the capital controls that were soon to be
•

imposed.

/8/

In sum,

the Japanese yen depreciated due to the U.S. criticisms of

Japanese imperialism. The instability between military aggression and signs

of truce, combined with the uncertainties in the U.S. economic prospects,
caused great volatility, as can be seen in the standard deviations in Table
2, Regimes Q-I, Q-II, and III.

6. Increasing International Conflicts in the Second Half of 1932

During the month f July 1932 (Regime Q-III), the exchange rate market

was rather calm.
controls.

This was mainly because of the newly enacted capital

Although the law of preventing capital flight would be found

ineffective later, uncertainty about implementing procedures in the first

month under the law made the transaction very thin, resulting in minor
volatility (with standard deviations, less than .20).

In the second half of 1932, there were two waves of yen depreciations,

11

one from August 5 to 19 (Regime IV) and another from October 26 to November

29 (Regime V). Yen depreciations in both regimes were mainly caused by
speculations outside Japan.

Since the capital flight prevention act was found to be ineffective as

a means of stopping capital movement, domestic speculations were not
effectively sealed by the new law to prevent capital flight. Investors and
speculators saw the weakening of the yen due to the diplomatic isolation of

Japan, which in turn was caused by increasing criticism from the United

States and other countries of Japan for its handling of Manchuria and
aggression toward China.
The

Japanese activity in Manchuria and in mainland China

was

investigated by the League of Nations. A fact-finding mission, which came
to Japan in February and submitted a report in October, was surprisingly (to

the Japanese) critical of Japan. The increasing tensions between Japan and

the western nations prompted foreign speculators to sell yen.

It was

considered at the time, "the movement of the yen depends on the foreign
countries' attitude toward Japan." (Chugai Shogyo Shinpo, October 4.)
The speculations occurred outside Japan, as evidenced by a larger share

of yen depreciation in the New York market during regimes IV and V.

As

Finance Minister Takahashj defended himself from the growing criticism for
yen depreciation, by saying that "speculations abroad cannot be controlled
[by the Japanese government]." (Chugaj Shogyo Shinpo, August 25, 1932)

U.s. Financial Crisis, FDR's New Deal, and the Dollar Off Gold

The dollar/yen exchange rate changes in 1933 were dominated by the
U.S. -oriented news. The yen appreciation was evident in the New York market

rather than in the Tokyo market, becuase the dollar was

12

depreciating (not

only against yen but also against sterling) in response to the U.S. news.
The financial crisis in March 1933, Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, the

decision to move dollars off the gold standard, and the increase in the
purchase price of gold contributed to the dollar depreciation throughout
Let us consider in detail exactly how each event corresponds to the

1933.

dollar depreciation (yen appreciation).

After being criticized for its military activities in China and
Manchuria, Japan withdrew from the League of Nations in March 1933.

Japan

became gradually, but steadily, isolated in the international political
circles.

From December 1932 to mid April 1933 (Regime Q-V), the dollar/yen
exchange rate was rather stable. Although the yen had started to appreciate
from a low of $20 recorded in November 1932, the process was very slow. The

stability in the $/yen level was rather surprising in light of many events

which we would consider fundamental to the determination of the exchange
rate.

In the spring of 1933, a financial crisis developed in the United

States. On February 14, a bank moratorium was imposed in Michigan, followed
by other states. On March 3, New York and Illinois declared moratoria.

By

this time, moratorium had spread to 38 states and operations and withdrawal

were limited in 10 other states and the District of Columbia. On March 4,
Franklin D. Roosevelt was inaugurated and new policies and directives were
issued immediately.

The nationwide bank moratorium, the suspention of

convertibility, and the gold embargo was announced on March 5.

The

financial market, including the exchange market was closed from March 4 to
March 12. When the market was reopened on March 13, strict capital controls
were imposed to prevent capital flight and speculation. The gold export was

restored with a licensing system (effective on March 10). It was not until

13

April 19 that the dollar went off gold.

The interest rate was raised sharply when the moratorium was lifted.
The New York Federal Reserve Bank raised the discount rate to 3.5 percent,

and the call rate jumped to 5 percent. The quotes of the dollar/yen rate
were not available in the Tokyo market during the period of moratorium. The

Japanese finaicial market was unaffected by the sharp increase in the call
rate in the United States.

It is puzzling from the viewpoint of the efficient market hypothesis
that the dollar did not depreciate (so that the yen against the dollar did
not appreciate) in March, when it became obvious from various news stories
that the dollar was going to be off gold soon. It is possible that resuming
gold export, though licenses were needed, was enough to reassure the market.

It may also have been the case that capital controls in Japan were strict
and

effective,

so

that the speculations could

not

take

place.

Alternatively, the appreciation pressure from widening the interest rate
spread was just enough to cancel the depreciation pressure from an increased
probability of going off gold permanently.

In the beginning of April, applications for gold export increased
sharply.

President Roosevelt announced the gold embargo on April 19.

The

dollar depreciation from April 19 to April 25 (Regime VI) was solely caused
by the decision by the United States to go off gold. Most depreciation took
place in the New York market, and the volatility in the New York market was

very large. The interest rate was stable at 0.725 percent in Tokyo and 1.0

percent during this period. The stability of the interest rates with the
exchange rate changes contrasts the March episode described above.

14

From the end of April to the beginning of June (Regime Q-VI), the
market was rather quiet. Although the total change was small, there is some
evidence from "market decomposed accumulated changes" that news in the Tokyo

market was causing the yen to depreciate while news in the New York market

was appreciating it.

On May 1, 1933, the Foreign Exchange Control Law

became effective. This superceded and strengthened the Law of Preventing
Capital Flight introduced a year earlier. With this new law, the government

was given the authority to control every aspect of foreign exchange.

In

fact, Japan tried to stabilize the value of yen with this exchange control
law.

When the dollar left the gold standard on April 20, Japan decided to

fix the value of yen to sterling, with a wide band. After April 20, the yen

was between 1 shilling 2 pence and a half and 1 shilling 2 pence and 1/16

for the rest of the year. Therefore, any change in the $/yen value after
April was actually the change in the value of the dollar against sterling
and yen.

From June 3 to July 18 (Regime VII-R), the dollar depreciated by more

than $5/100 yen. At the end of May, the U.S. formally abolished the gold

another depreciation wave.

When

the

U.S.

representative opposed taking measures to stabilize the exchange rate

(on

June 28) in the Monetary and Economic Conference in London (June 21 -

July

linkage,

setting

off

27), and when President Roosevelt further indicated that he would put a

priority on domestic stimulation, another wave of dollar depreciation
resulted.

Again, most of the relevant news originated in New York.

This

scenario is confirmed by a high mean of depreciation of dollars and high
volatility in the New York market for the VII-R regime.

The yen depreciated from mid-July to the end of July by $3/lOOyen
(Regime VIII).

The depreciation was mainly caused in Tokyo market.
15

However, no obvious reason for this is found.

From August to the end of October (Regime Q-VIII), the exchange market

was quiet. A strong recovery of the U.S. economy was expected due to the
policy package under the New Deal during the summer of 1933.

price increased by 50% from the bottom recorded in March.

The stock
However, in

September, it became evident that production and employment rates were not

improving as planned. The performance of the economy disappointed workers
and the number of strikes increased.

On October 22, President Roosevelt announced that the government would

purchase gold at higher prices. A government agency, the Reconstruction
Finance

Corporation,

started buying domestically produced

gold

at

$3l.36/troy oz. on October 25, and then the price was gradually raised to

$34.06 on December 18. Moreover, the New York Federal Reserve

Bank was

instructed to purchase gold from abroad. The U.S. bought $12 million of

domestic gold and $5 million of foreign gold.

More money would be

circulated, prices would be increased and the production would be increased.
Essentially, this was a deliberate dollar devaluation (depreciation)

policy.

These events were responsible for a large depreciation of the dollar

The dollar

depreciated against yen by more than $4/yen, about 5% for this period.
Since the major news originated in the New York market, the New York market

was responsible for the depreciation of the dollar, and the
the New York market far exceeded that of the Tokyo market.

8. Interest Rate Effects on the Exchange Rate Determination
In the modern view of the portfolio balance approach, the exchange rate

strongly responds to the interest rate differential. In fact, exchange rate
fluctuations back in 1927 and 1928 were caused by capital flows prompted by

interest rate differentials (Bank of Tokyo (1969)). It is of our interest

to check whether the interest rate differentials between Japan and the
United States was at all relevant to the exchange rate movement from 1931 to

1933. The time series of the differential in the call rates of the U.S. and
Japan is depicted in Figure 3a. The change in the exchange rate is shown in

Figure 3b for comparison. Casual observations of these figures do not
convince us that the interest differential was dominantly responsible for
changes of the exchange rate. In order to rigorously evaluate the effect of

the interest rate differential on the exchange rate, we proceed to test a
particular hypothesis.

Insert Figures 3a and 3b about here

If uncovered interest parity and rational expectations hold, the
interest rate differential between the U.S. and Japan would predict movement

in the dolar/yen exchange rate (for example, see Ito (1988) for arithmetics

of uncovered interest parity). In particular, a higher U.S. interest rate,

If expectations are rational (unbiased), the realized (ex

post) rate is the sum of the expected rate and the random forecast errors.
From this point of view, one may want to regress the change in the realized
future exchange rate, NYDY(t÷1)-NYDY(t), on the interest rate differential,
INTDIF(t) =

NYR(t)-TKR(t). We expect the positive sign on the interest rate

differential. Results are shown in Panel A of the Table 3. An estimated

result is also robust with respect to a sample split.

The

Thus, uncovered

interest parity combined with rational expectations would not explain the
exchange rate movement. However, the predicted change in the exchange rate
overnight due to the interest rate differential would be very small, so that
it would not be depicted in the regression.

Insert Table 3 about here

An alternative link between the interest rate and the exchange rate is

the following channel.

If the monetary policy is going to change, the

interest rate is most likely to pick up first. In other words, the change

in the interest rate differential represents the news to the financial
market.

Therefore, if this is a major source, the change in the interest

rate differential would be significant in the exchange rate equation.

The

portfolio balance approach would predict that an increase in the U.S.
interest rate attracts the foreign investment into the U.S., thus causes the

dollar appreciation (yen depreciation). Therefore, according to theory, the

coefficient of INTDIF(t+l)-JNTDIF(t) on the should be negative.

regression results are shown in panel B of Table 3.

The

The estimated

coefficients in all equations are insignificant, with or without the

constant term, and whether a full or a split sample is considered.
Therefore, the explanatory power of the interest rate on the exchange rate
changes is very weak. However, the failure of ditecting any influence from

the interest rate to the exchange rate may not be surprising, considering

the fact that the exchange rate was much more volatile than the interest

18

rate differentials, as depicted in Figure 3b.
In sum, only a fraction of the exchange rate volatility is explained by

the interest rate differential or its changes.

This negative result

justifies our news analysis approach in preceding sections, in that the
exchange rate responded primarily to political decisions and actions during
the two year period.

9. Was Yen Depreciation a Policy Objective?
The conventional wisdom is that Takahashi's policy depreciated the yen

and the depreciation helped export. See Nanto and Takagi (1985. p.371) and
Nakamura (1983, ch. 9).

The view is correct to the extent that Takahashi

decided to go off gold and allowed a hard landing in December 1931.
However, it would be misleading to say that Japan pursued a deliberate
depreciation policy to help an export drive in 1932.

Our close examination of the exchange rate movements reveals that the

yen depreciation ! se was not a policy objective. After the hard landing,
the yen depreciated further. Our analysis shows that military aggressions
and foreign criticisms against them are resposible for a substantial part of

the yen depreciation of the 1931-32 period.

The financial market was

sensitive to the political risk in holding the yen-denominated asset.

The

market might have foreseen trade sanctions, an embargo or a blockade against

Japan, although actual problems as such did not materialize until years
later.

In the meantime, the Japanese export soared and the balance of

payments started to improve in 1932.

We dismissed the (changes of) interest rate differential as a major
source of changes of the exchange rate. However, one might counter to our
position saying that fiscal and monetary policies were conducted, though not

19

evident in the interest rate, so that the exchange rate could be influenced.

It is well-known that Finance Minister Takahashi conducted a debt-financed
fiscal expansion. In fact, the (central) government expenditures increased

by 32.5 percent and by 15.6 percent in Fiscal Years 1932 and 1933,
respectively. However, money supply (Ml) increased only 6.9 percent and 4.8
percent in 1932 and 1933, respectively.

It is granted that fiscal policies

contributed to the early recovery of the Japanese economy. However, it is

quite questionable that those policies were conducted to prompt yen
depreciation

which in turn helped export and output.

If the yen depreciation was designed to promote export, it would have

been promoted so by the government and the business. On the contrary, the

Japanese business leaders were asking the government to stop the yen
depreciation.

The Chamber of Commerce in Osaka asked the government to

stabilize (i.e., prevent depreciation of) the yen as early as January, 1932.

The Tokyo Chamber of Commerce followed the suit in February. However, the
opinions were mixed in the first half of 1932. After the yen dropped below
$25/100 yen in the summer of 1932, the public opinion became solid in asking
the government to stop the depreciation.

Although Finance Minister Takahashi had stuck to a position that he

would let the market determine the level and there would be nothing the
government could do to prevent yen depreciation, , the government gradually

shifted its position. In July 1932, the Act of Preventing Capital Flight
was introduced, although it soon became clear that loopholes were so large
that the Act did not stop capital movement effectively. (See Bank of Japan
(1985, pp.

84-89).) Facing a further depreciation in the second half of

1932, the government introduced a stricter law. The Foreign Exchange Control

Law

was

introduced to the Parliament on February 14, 1933, passed the

Parliament on March 17, and became effective on May 1, 1933. This law was

Takagi

(1985), citing Nakamura

(1983),

the

interpretation that the exchange rate control was introduced to limit import

and to improve balance of payments, and preceded the United States, England
and Germany. On the contrary, the law of 1933 was intended to limit capital

export, thus preventing further depreciation of the yen. Exchange controls

at least at the time of introduction were not aimed at limiting import or
promoting export.

characteristics common to that in late 1970s and the 1980s. The exchange
rate changes came in waves, and they corresponded to many news relevant to
the value of currencies. This observation is supported by a general success
of our "news analysis." Major news, such as decisions to go off gold (which
happend in 1931 in Japan, and in 1933 in the U.S.), caused the exchange rate

flucutuations immediatly in the home market. (However, there were a few
instances that the correspondence between relevant news and a large exchange

rate movement broke down.) As capital controls were introduced in Japan (in
the second half of 1932) and the United States (in 1933), capital movements
with speculative motives were significantly curtailed.
In sum, reasons for the yen depreciation from December 1931 to November

1932 can be summarized as follows. The yen depreciated by about 30 percent

($50 to $35 per 100 yen) in three weeks following (the anticipation and
reality of) the yen going off gold in December 1931 (Regime I).

21

This was a

clear-cut hard-landing from the overvalued "old parity." Most depreciation

took place in the Tokyo market just before and after the announcement of
gold embargo. During the year of 1932, the yen lost another 40 percent ($35
to $20 per 100 yen) of its value in several waves of depreciations separated

by calm periods (Regimes Q-I through Q-V).

aggressions. During the year of 1932, sources of depreciation and volatility

gradually shifted from the Tokyo market to markets abroad.

This is an

evidence that foreign investors and speculators became more sensitive to the

political risk of holding the yen as Japan became criticized by the
international diplomatic circles.

Clearly this depreciation was

not

engineered for export drive by the Japanese government's policy, but rather
a byproduct of its military adventures.

The the dollar/yen exchange rate moved from $20 to $30 per 100 yen in
1933. However, this was not the yen appreciation, but the dollar deprecia-

don.

The main news which affected the exchange rate originated in the

United States.

The effects of worsening of the Great Depression and the

decision to go off gold by the United States dominated the market.
The end of gold standard and political events mainly drove the exchange

market. The interest rate differential had little explanatory power on the
exchange rate movement.

FOOTNOTES

/1/. Japan joined the gold standard in 1897 after receiving the 311 million

yen (38 million British Pounds) indemnity from China as a result of the
Sino-Japanese war of 1894-95. The established parity implied approximately

2 yen to the dollar. Japan, along with European countries, suspended the

gold standard during the First World War.

Sweden, after a

strong

deflationary policy, returned to the gold standard at the old parity in the

beginning of the 192Os. British sterling returned to the gold standard in
1925, despite the advice of John M. Keynes against it.

In 1926. France

joined the gold standard, but at a fraction of the pre World War I parity
due to the severe inflation after the war.

Although many European countries resumed the gold standard system in
the 1920s, Japan did not formally return to the gold standard until January
1930.

However, the domestic policies of l920s were conducted in order to

keep the exchange rate near the old parity, that is, approximately 2
yen/dollar or 10 yen/L. At the time, it was believed that returning to the
gold standard would be stimulating to the sagging economy. However, the yen

was overvalued, and the demand from United States was declining due to the

weak economy and protectionism. Cold reserve drained and the Japanese
economy was in a recession. This prompted the policy change under the new
cabinet.

The dramatic mistake of sticking to the fixed exchange rate when

economic conditions were changed was going to be repeated some forty
years later in Japan.

The new government led by Prime Minister Inugai was formed on
December 13,

1931.

The new Finance Minister, Korekiyo Takahashi

immediately suspended the export of gold, and the convertibility of
yen. The Ministry Directive No. 36, issued and effective on December

13, stated that "(i) Export of gold coins and bars is subject to
approval of the Finance Minister; (ii) Violaters to (i) shall be

imprisoned for a period not exceeding three months or shall be
subject to a penalty not exceeding 100 yen; (iii) If a person sells
gold bars, or if a person collects, melts, or defaces gold coins to

be resold, then the person is subject to the same penalty as
described in (ii)." For the basis of the directive, Finance Minister

Minister repeatedly pointed out that the yen was overvalued and the

depreciation would be good for the Japanese industry, and that it
would be the best to let the market determine the exchange rate.

the statistical summary is calculated.

The following

information is available for making inference on the size of bid-ask
spread during the period in question.

First, for selected days, the newspaper also reports the ask
rate in the Tokyo market.

When the exchange rate experiences a very

rapid change, such as one after the gold embargo, the bid-ask spread

was as much as $1 (when the level was $40/lOOyen, that is 2.5%).
However, most of the time, the spread was between $.50 (i.e., 1.67%)

and $.25 when the rate is volatile, and it was between $.25 (i.e.,
0.83% at $30/l00yen) and $.125 (i.e., 0.42% at $30/lOOyen) when the
rate is calm.

Second, the bid-ask spread for the pound/yen rate in

the London market is available daily from December 1933 on.

It

suggests that the spread is mostly between 0.7 and 0.9 ¼, and
occasionaly up to 1.4%.

Third, if during each quiet period there is

no particular bias in depreciation and appreciation news falling in

the Tokyo and N.Y., then the per-day average change should be near
zero in each market in each quiet (Q) regime after the bid-ask spread
is adjusted.

These observations make us confident that the bid-ask spread can

be inferred as notes in Table 2.

It is not essential to precisely

estimate the day-by-day bid-ask spread for our purpose.

It suffices

to estimate the average bid-ask spread for the regime. Moreover, our
volatility measure, the standard error of the exchange rate change in

a market, is independent from the estimate of the bid-ask spread,
given that the bid-ask spread is taken to be a unknown constant.

However, dating is not crucial to so long as the alternatives are

/8/

Bank of Japan (1985; p.65) lists another reason fore the

yen

depreciation of this period: Seiyuukai, the majority party, advocated a
further yen depreciation, and the advocated policy caused a speculative
selling of yen outside Japan. This explanation is consistent with the fact
that most of yen appreciation took place in the New York market.

However,

there is a difficulty with this explanation. The Japanese government at the

time was going to impose the Act of preventing capital flight in order to

stop yen depreciation caused by speculation. Policies of advocating the

depreciation and of preventing capital flight are conflicting in their
effects.

Moreover, the above-mentioned explanation implies the delayed reaction

of the exchange rate to the news. If Yen moves in the New York market
reacting to Japan-oriented news, it implies either that it took time to
digest news or that the Japanese traders could not foresee how American
traders would react to the news. Note that, in the l980s, even if traders

of different nationalities are heterogeneous, a reaction to the news is
immediate since all traders can, and do, participate in any market in the

world via telephone. The communication technology available in the 1930s
did not allow the institutions in New York to trade in real time in Tokyo.

Table 2 continued

Notes to Table 2
1. A number in [
2.

] is

a total change for the regime.

The bid-ask spread is assumed as follows:

(i) $0501100 yen from

December 11, 1931 to December 30, 1932; (ii) $0.20/lOU yen from December 31,

1931 to November 29, 1932; (iii) $0.15/lOO yen from November 30, 1932 to
April 18, 1933; (iv) $0.20/lOO yen from April 19, to November 21, 1933. For
the basis of this assumption, see footnote 5.

3. Since there are missing observations, the number of observations do not

necessarily match the number of business days.

When the changes are

measured, one missing observation in a market will cause two missing
observations in "changes."
