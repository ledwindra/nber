The new empirical regularities considered differ from earlier ones, e.g., the well-known Kaldor stylized facts.  The new research no longer makes production function accounting a central part of the analysis.  Instead, attention shifts more directly to questions like, Why do some countries grow faster than others?  It is this changed focus that, in our view, has motivated going beyond the neoclassical growth model.\n\n",
