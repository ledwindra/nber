    "abstract": "\n\nWe propose a local projection (LP) based difference-in-differences approach that subsumes many of the recent solutions proposed in the literature to address possible biases arising from negative weighting. We combine LPs with a flexible \u2018clean control\u2019 condition to define appropriate sets of treated and control units. Our proposed LP-DiD estimator can be implemented with various weighting and normalization schemes for different target estimands, can be extended to include covariates or accommodate non-absorbing treatment, and is simple and fast to implement. A simulation and two empirical applications demonstrate that the LP-DiD estimator performs well in common applied settings.\n\n",
