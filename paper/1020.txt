The Impact of Public Health Policy:
The Case of Community Health Centers

ABSTRACT
The aim of this paper is to assess the impact of the Community

Health Center (CHC) on health levels in the U.S. Using infant mortality as the underlying health indicator, a time series of large counties as the data set, and multivariate regression techniques, we
investigate the extent to which the presence of a program in a county

affects future mortality. We find that CHCs have negative and statistically significant impacts on white and black infant mortality rates.
The centers have larger effects on black infant mortality than on

white infant mortality. The reduction in the black infant mortality
rate between 1970 and 1978 due to the CHC system amounts to one death

per thousand live births or approximately 12 percent of the observed
decline.

This result is particularly striking in light of the well-

known higher
excess

infant mortality rate of blacks. A reduction in the

mortality rate of black babies has been dentf1ed as a goal

of public health policy for a number of years. Our results suggest
that community health centers have the potential to make a substan-

tial contribution to the achievement of this goal.

This is a study of the Impact of a Federally sponsored health Ini-

tiative on health status. Since 1965 a network of Federally funded
community health centers (CHCs) have developed in the United States to
deliver comprehensive ambulatory care, both primary and preventive, to

poverty populations in medically underserved areas. The program to
create

and fund these centers, originally termed neighborhood health

centers, was started by the Office of Economic Opportunity as part of
the

War on

Poverty. By 1973

overall control of the centers had been

shifted to the Bureau of Community Health Services (BCHS),

Health

Services Administration, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,
and

the centers began to be referred to as community health centers.

New and smaller variants of the basic CHC model were created in 1975
and 1978 by the introduction of the Rural Health Initiative and the

Urban Health Initiative, respectively. Concomitant with these
legislative developments, the number of CHCs increased from 51 in
1968 to 104 in 1974 and to approximately 800 in 1980.1_6

A prelImInary version of this paper was presented at an InvIted
session on Financing Versus Direct Care Delivery for Underserved
Populations at the American Public Health Association annual meeting, Los Angeles, California, November 1—5, 1981. We wish to thank

CHCs were only one component of a broad Federal initiative which

was meant to address the "underiyin" causes of poverty as well as the
poverty population's health needs. The poor were mired in a "vicious
cycle of poverty," a popularized shorthand which meant that they lacked
employment or were underemployed and were politically disenfranchised.

The War on Poverty which was launched under the auspices of the Federal
government included, therefore, programs such as the Job Corps

and

—2—
Community Action Programs as well as those specifically aimed at affecting the health needs of the poor such as CHCs, maternal and infant

care programs, children and youth projects, and family planning clinics.

The programs were not, however, neatly compartmentalized in their

aims: for example, health programs directed at health goals. Conunu—
nity health centers were "... viewed as shotgun attempts to operate'

simultaneously on all action variables."' In fact, proponents of the
CRC program argued that the centers were best used to inject Federal
funds Into the community, act as a locus of legal and political support,
and provide educational training as well as direct employment for conmtu—

nity members. Given this, an evaluation of the medical care component
of the CHCs and more importantly its impact on the community's health
status is not easily accomplished.

The political and economic climate has shifted during the nearly

two decades of the CRC program's existence. Whatever the reasons,
these are times of fiscal austerity, and the momentum of public initia-

tives has shifted emphasis from equity to efficiency. Health programs

now have improvements in health status as their overriding goal. Other
beneficial outcomes such as improved community employment are welcome

but unnecessary. Moreover, the very existence of a particular health
program is predicated on actual or potential evidence that it is

competitive with alternative programs. As Rush7 recently has written
of the WIC program: "If we are to rationally allocate resources, we
must know whether programs work."

—3—
The aim of this paper is to assess the impact of the C}IC program

on health levels. That is, we look for an answer to Rush's query:
"Does it work?" Using infant mortality as the underlying health indicator, a time

series

of large counties as the data set, and multi—

variate regression techniques, we investigate the extent to which the

presence of a program in a county affects future mortality. Our esti—
mates control for other determinants of infant mortality such as income
and

health

manpower availability. Although CHCs are not limited in

terms of the types of services provided or the age classes of those
receiving services, we focus on infant mortality because it is gen-

erally accepted that where infant mortality rates are high health
levels in all segments of the population are likely to be low.8

Moreover, CUCs were designed in part to service target populations

with high infant mortality rates. tn addition, all centers must provide prenatal and post partum care and voluntary family planning services, each of which can have substantial impacts on infant mortal—
To the extent that health benefits of CBCs are conferred on
other members of the population, our findings will understate and
thus provide conservative estimates of the impact of the centers on
health status.

Methods and Data

To estimate the effects of CUCs on health status, alternative versions of infant mortality multiple regression equations or impact func-

tions are fitted. The two

is the infant mortality rate in the 1th county of

the United States in year t, c_1 is the per capita number of cotnmu—

nity health centers in the th county in year t—i, ci is the square
of the per capita number of centers,

is a vector of other determi-

nants of infant mortality such as family income and the per capita
number of physicians, and

is the infant mortality rate in year

t—l. In equation (2) the per capita number of C}lCs and its square are

replaced by a set of four dichotomous variables given by
i —

1, 2, 3, 4. Here pi1 equals one if the initial service date of

the ith CRC in the th county (the year in which the CHC began to deliver

medical care services) was as early as or earlier than year t—l.

Four dichotomous variables are employed because very few counties in
our

sample (described below) had more than four CHCs during the sample

period (1969—1978).

Equation (1) constitutes a quadratic specification of the effects
of CRCs on infant mortality, while equation (2) constitutes a

dichotomous variable specification. Both specifications are employed

—5—

because

the appropriate way to measure the size of public programs such

as CHCs and their impacts on health status remains an open issue.

This

is particularly true in our case because we have no data on the utiliza—

tion or expenditures of CHCs. Moreover, the medical care services that
they deliver are intended to affect the health of all segments of the
poverty population and not just pregnant women and infants.

The qua-

dratic specification allows for nonlinear effects from the placement of
additional centers in the same county, at least on a per capita basis.

That is, the health "returns" to the centers could diminish as more are

added if they simply compete for the same population. On the other hand,
health

"returns" could increase if the greater presence of centers prompts

still greater acceptance and use of their services.
The dichotomous

variable specification allows for more flexible non—

linearities than the quadratic specification and, in the absence of county—
specific time series on the size of the poverty population, permits us to

explore alternatives to per capita measurement. Note that the regression
coefficients of p1, p2, p3, and pl+ give the marginal effects of the place-

ment of CHCs on infant mortality. The coefficient of p1 compares counties

with no CHCs to those with one CRC. The coefficient of p2 compares counties with two CNCs to those with one, and the coefficient of p3 compares

those with three to those with two. Finally, the coefficient of p4 compares counties with four or more CHCs to those with three. The sum of
the four coefficients gives the difference in mortality rates between
counties with four or more CHCs and those with none.

The specification of the impact functions recognize explicitly the
plausible proposition that CUCs will affect infant mortality with a lag

rather than instantaneously. The equation assumes a one—year lag be—

tween the year in which a dC

begins

to deliver services

and its

—6—
initial impact on infant mortality. To allow for the possibility that
the length of the initial impact lag is more than one year, two— and

three—year lag models also were estimated in preliminary research. The
results of these models (not shown) did not improve upon those of the
basic equations, possibly because of the gross nature of the CIIC mea-

sures. The members of the Xj

vector

are not lagged because some vari-

ables can affect infant mortality within a relatively short period,

particularly those that do not represent new innovations in the medical
care delivery system for poverty populations.

Theoretically, the lagged infant mortality rate is an important

variable to include in the regression equations because CHCs were designed to service target populations with poor health indicators. Consequently, estimates of their impacts are biased toward zero if the
initial level of the mortality rate is omitted from the regression.
That is, the presence of a center would be associated with high mortal-

ity. The use of the lagged rate as an independent variable also controls for unmeasured determinants of infant mortality that are corre-

lated with the included variables. In addition, the effects of the
placement of a CHC in a county will fall over time if there are upward
trends

in the percentage of the eligible population serviced and the

amount of medical care delivered and diminishing returns to care.
Simultaneously,

mortality differentials between counties with CHCs and

those without them will widen over time. Both these effects are cap—

tured

*

by including the lagged infant mortality rate in the regressions.

*

This

point can be demonstrated in a simple fashion by employing

equation (2) and by assuming that counties either have one CHC or

none. Suppose that county 1 receives a CHC in year t—l while county 2

prior to the increase in the CHC variable. Since the lagged infant
mortality rate is held constant in regressions (1) and (2), they constitute a short—run model of the impact of CHCs.

Note that the basic model may be viewed as the result of applying a Koyck13transformation to an infinite—lag distributed—lag model

with geometrically declining weights.* Because the assumptions that
underlie the Koyck lag structure are somewhat restrictive, an ad hoc

The county—specific infant mortality rate (mw) in the initial year of
the time series (1969 in our sample) is included in these regressions

to control for the placement of CHCs in counties with poor health in—

dicators.* In principal such regressors as, for example,

c12, c3

etcetera should be included in equation (3) to make it an ad hoc

distributed—lag model. These variables are omitted because the appropriate lag structure is not known and because multicollinearity among

members of the distributed—lag vector of CRC variables is high. Given
this high degree of correlation, we Interpret the coefficients of the

In

addition to relaxing the assumptions that underlie the Koyck

lag structure, estimation of the cumulative model is desirable because
it is possible that the short— and long—run effects of CHCs are under-

stated in the Koyck model. This occurs if the contemporaneous
correlation between a CHC measure and the infant mortality rate [for

example, the correlation between
c11,1

and m1_1 in equation (1)] be-

comes negative after some point in time. Initially, this correlation

will be positive, reflecting the placement of CHCs in counties with

above average infant mortality rates. Ultimately, however, it may
become negative if c2 has a substantial impact on
the correlation between

c2 and c1 is positive and fairly large.

youth

projects, and family planning centers, are omitted from the regres-

sions. CHCs may be substitutes or complements for these components of
the delivery system. They are substitutes if the availability of another
program lowers the utilization of CUCs and complements if the reverse

holds. For example, if a CRC and a family planning clinic are located
in the same county, utilization of family planning services at the CRC

may be smaller than if there were no family planning clinic. On the
other hand, the existence of a CRC and a maternal and infant care

project in the same proximity may encourage utilization of both via
referrals.

Strictly speaking, if different types of projects tend to be lo-

cated in the same areas, the omission of the other projects understates the impacts of CHCs on infant mortality if these projects
are

substitutes for CHCs and overstates the impacts of CHCs if they

are complements. The reverse conditions hold if the presence of a CRC

in a county is negatively related to the presence of other projects.
But, as the preceding examples illustrate, the direction of the bias
is not certain because locational patterns are not clear and because
CHCs may be substitutes for some projects and complements for others.

During

our sample period, the U.S. infant mortality rate fell at

an annually compounded rate of approximately 5 percent per year. The
lagged infant mortality rate obviously is negatively related to time.
Therefore, in the short—run specification, the former variable controls
in part for the effects of time1 and a time trend is omitted from the

regression models. This is because the inclusion of a time trend
creates serious problems of utulticollinearity, especially since the

data span a short nine year period. Since m10 replaces m11 as a regressor in the cumulative model, unmeasured trend effects are not held

constant in that model, This factor alone biases upward in absolute

value the CHC effects in the cumulative model. Note, however, from
the previous footnote that the omission of certain members of the distributed lag vector of CHC variables biases downward the cumulative

effect. Therefore, biases due to the omission of time are mitigated.
Regression results without time are presented in the next sectio:1 and

we indicate how these results are altered when time is included,

*
A potential remedy to problems associated with time trends and

serial correlation is to take first differences of all variables.

We did not employ this approach because it assumes that the regression residuals exhibit first—order serial correlation with a serial

correlation coefficient equal to one. Preliminary results led to a
rejection of this key assumption. The estimation of the precise
nature of a serial correlation process, particularly in models
with lagged dependent variables, is difficult, frequently has a high

standard error, and is sensitive to alternative specifications. Con—
sequently, we did not pursue this approach.

The basic

data set employed in this paper is the Area Resource

File (ARF). The ARF is a county—based data service, prepared by
Applied Management Sciences, Inc., for the Bureau of Health Professions, Health Resources Administration, U.S. Department of Health and

Human Services. It incorporates information from a variety of sources
for 3,077 counties in the United States. These counties also can be
aggregated into larger geographic areas such as county groups, Standard

Metropolitan Statistical Areas, and states. Deaths by age, race, and
sex for the years 1969 through 1978 are obtained from the National
Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) Mortality Tape.

Births by race

for those years are obtained from the NCHS Natality Tapes. County—
specific time series pertaining to health manpower and facilities come
from the American Medical Association, the American Hospital Associa-

tion, and other sources. Demographic and socioeconomic characteristics
for 1970 are taken from the 1970 Census of Population and from other

sources for years before and after 1970. We have added Information on
the location and initial service dates of CUCs to the ARF. This infor—
niatlon Is derived from the Bureau of Community Health Services Common
Reporting Requirements data tape (the BCRR tape).

*

Since we use race— and age—specific infant mortality data (see

below), the death data are based on the August 1978 and December 1980

versions of the ARF. Deaths for 1978 were provided to us directly by
Applied Management Sciences.

— 14 —

In
two

the regression estimates, a distinction is drawn

between

the

components of infant mortality: neonatal mortality and postneo—

natal mortality. Neonatal mortality refers to deaths of infants
within the first 27 days of life. Postneonatal mortality refers to
deaths of infants between the ages of 28 and 364 days. Neonatal
deaths are usually caused by congenital. anormalies, prematurity, and

complications of delivery; while postneonatal deaths are usually

caused by infectious diseases and accidents. Since the causes of the
two types of infant deaths are dissimilar, CHCs may have different ef-

fects on each. This possibility is examined by using the neonatal,
postneonatal, and total infant mortality rates as alternative depen-

dent variables. In addition separate regressions are fitted for white
infant mortality and for black infant mortality as well as regressions

for

*
infant mortality of all races.

This is because black infant mor-

tality rates are much higher than white rates.

Counties rather than states or SMSAs are used as the units of ob-

servation. As indicated by their name, CHCs are intended to serve the
residents of particular communities, and counties are the smallest

geographic areas on the ARF. On the other hand, SMSAS and states are
very large and sometimes heterogenous. Income, medical resources, and
other relevant variables may vary greatly within an SMSA or a state.

Since counties are much more homogeneous, these problems are reduced in

our research. A weakness with the use of counties is that the small size
of some of these areas may mean that people may receive medical care out-

side the county. Moreover, the small number of births in certain counties
may increase the importance of random movements or "noise" in the determination of regression coefficients.

We reduce these problems with county data by including in the regressions only counties with a population of at least 50,000 persons in

1970. A county must also have at least 5,000 blacks for inclusion in the
black impact regressions. There are 678 counties in the white regressions
*

and 358 counties in the black regressions.

In addition to selecting

large counties, we attenuate random elements by estimating weighted re-

gressions, where the set of weights is the square root of the total or
race—specific number of births.
There are nine alternative dependent variables in the regression

equations: the total, white, and black infant mortality rates; the
total, white, and black neonatal mortality rates; and the total, white,

black

and

hand

postneonatal mortality rates. The lagged rate on the right—

side of each equation corresponds to the rate that is being used as

the dependent variable. The first observation on the dependent variable
pertains
because

the last observation pertains to 1978.

and ends in 1978. Thus, the regression equations

series

are fitted to a time

of the 678 largest counties (358 in the case of the black regres-

sions) of the U.S. for the period 1970—1978.
The roles of the CHC variables, the lagged infant mortality rate,
and the initial (1969) infant mortality rate in the regressions have

been discussed in detail. In the non—race—specific regressions, the percentage of nonwhite births controls for the higher death rates of non-

white babies. Real median family income and office—based physicians in
private practice per thousand population have been stressed conceptually
and empirically as basic determinants of infant mortality in previous re-

search8'15'16 and are included in the regressions. Race—specific family

income is employed as a regressor in race—specific regressions. In all
cases money family income is divided by the Consumer Price Index to ob—
*
tam real family income.
Only the regression coefficients of the CHC

variables are presented in the next section. It is important to realize,

that the year—to—year percentage change in

regressions for all races, it makes little difference whether

two variables are highly correlated. We select median family income

Results

Table 1 contains regression coefficients of the community health
center measures (CRC, the number of centers per thousand population,
and CHCSQ, the square of the number of centers per thousand population)
and related statistics in the two versions of the quadratic specifica-

tion. The first version is the Koyck or short—run model and is obtained by including the relevant lagged infant mortality rate as a

regressor. The long—run effects in that model obtained by dividing the
CRC coefficients by one minus the coefficient of the lagged infant mor-

tality rate, are shown in brackets. The second version of the quadratic
specification is the cumulative model and is obtained by replacing the

lagged infant mortality rate with the mortality rate in 1969. For
reasons discussed in Section I, the CRC coefficients in the cumulative
model are alternative estimates of long—run effects.
The results in Table 1 indicate that community health centers in
general have negative and statistically significant impacts on the

alternative infant mortality rates studied. The coefficient of CRC is
negative and significant in sixteen of eighteen cases. The exceptions
pertain to the two white postneonatal mortality regressions. The coefficient of the square term always is positive, which implies that

are diminishing returns to the placement of centers, at least on
a per capita basis. It should be noted that the significance of the
there

CRC coefficients

is not an artifact of the nonlinear specification.

When the square term is omitted, the sixteen negative CRC coefficients

their signs

— 19

of CRC that "minimizes" the relevant infant mortality rate (that is, the
value of CRC beyond which the infant mortality rate begins to rise) falls
outside the range of all observations.
The CRC regression coefficients associated with the dummy varia-

ble specification are presented in Table 2. Recall that the four
dichotomous variables denote whether the initial service date of the
first (P1), second (P2), third (P3), or fourth (P4) CRC in a given

county was as early as or earlier than year t—l. The results in Table 2
are less clearcut than those in Table 1. Fifty—seven of the seventy—
two regression coefficients (or 79 percent of the coefficients) are
negative, but only twenty—three of the negative effects are significant.

The hypothesis that no member of the set of four dichotomous variables
has a nonzero effect is accepted in six of eighteen cases at the 5 percent level of significance and in eight of eighteen cases at the 1 per-

cent level of significance (see the F—ratios in Table 2). The
marginal effects of the placement of additional CIICa in the same county

do not demonstrate a consistent pattern. For example, in the short—run
infant mortality regression for all races, the mortality differential
between counties with one CRC and counties with two CUCs (.3 deaths per
thousand live births) exceeds the differential between counties with one

CRC and those with none (.1 deaths per thousand live births). In addition, the excess mortality of counties with three CHCs compared to those
with two (less than .1 deaths per thousand live births) is smaller than
the excess mortality of counties with three CBCs compared to those with
four (.2 deaths per thousand live births).

In

spite of the above points, the findings in the two

tables

are

consistent with each other. Both sets of results contain the implica-

that the growth in CHCs during the l970s has contributed to the
decline in infant mortality during that period. Both sets are shown
tion

because of the exploratory nature of this research and the crude

measurement of the CHC variables. The negative effects that emerge
from the quadratic and dichotomous variable specifications and from
the short—run and cumulative versions of each specification strengthen

our confidence in the basic findings. Since the coefficients of
determination in the quadratic specification (not shown) are at
least as large as (and frequently larger than) the corresponding co-

efficients in the dichotomous variable specification, the former is

preferred to the latter. This suggests that it is important to take
account of the size of the clientele of CHCs. Surely the number of
users is positively related to the size of the population.

So far we have said nothing about the magnitudes of the negative

impacts of CHCs on infant mortality. To address this issue, we examine the net or partial contribution of the centers to overall reductions in the nine infant mortality rates between 1970 and 1978 in

Table 3. Specifically, we apply the regression coefficients of the
preferred quadratic specification to trends in the CHC measures in

period under consideration.* To illuminate the nature of the

computations, note that the total infant mortality rate of all races
fell by 5.9 deaths per thousand live births, from 19.6 in 1970 to
13.7 in 1978 (see Table 3, row 1, columns l_3).** Based on the Koyck

model, the short—run contribution of the CHC system to this reduction
amounts to .1 deaths per thousand live births or 2 percent of the
decline.

The preceding computation ignores, for example, the reduction

in the white and non—race specific

and to the sample of 358 counties in the black regressions.

They are weighted by the year—specific total or race—specific number of

are lagged one year in the regressions. The long—run contribution in

in infant mortality in year t due to an increase in the per capita number of CHCs in year t—2. When these effects are incorporated, the
long—run contribution is obtained. It amounts to a drop of .3 deaths
per thousand live births or 5 percent of the observed decline. An
alternative estimate of the long—run effect is provided by the cuinula—

tive

model. The absolute and percentage variants of this estimate are

contained

total

in the last two columns

of Table 3. In the case of the

infant mortality rate of all races, the long—run and cumulative

contributions are almost identical.

The twenty—four computations of declines in various infant mortality rates due to the CHC system range from a low of less than .1 deaths
per thousand live births (the short—run contribution to the decline in
the non—race—specific postneonatal mortality rate) to a high of 1.2
deaths per thousand live births (the cumulative contribution to the

decline in the black total infant mortality rate). When these effects
are expressed as percentages of the observed reductions, they range
from a low of 2 percent in several instances to a high of 18 percent

in the instance of the long—run black postneonatal contribution. In
general the cumulative effects are slightly larger than the correspond-

ing long—run effects. The close agreement between these two alternative sets of estimates underscores the robustness of the computations.
According to the figures in Table 3, CHCs have larger absolute effects

on neonatal mortality than on postneonatal mortality. When, however,
the contributions are expressed as percentages of the observed declines,

the postneonatal impacts exceed the neonatal impacts. In part this
finding reflects the fact that the postneonatal mortality rate is much
smaller than the neonatal mortality rate.

— 23 —

The most notable finding in Table 3 is that CHCs have larger un—
pacts on black infant mortality (total or age—specific) than on white

infant mortality. This result emerges whether the effects are expressed as absolute contributions to observed reductions or as con-

tributions as percentages of the corresponding reductions. This
result

is particularly striking in light of the well—known higher

infant

mortality rate of blacks. A reduction in the excess mortal-

ity rate of black babies has been identified as a goal of public

health policy for a number of years. Our results suggest that
community health centers have the potential to make a substantial

contribution to the achievement of this goal. In particular, the
long—run reduction in the black total infant death rate between 1970
and 1978 due to the CRC system amounts to one death per thousand live

birth or approximately 12 percent of the observed decline. In appreciating the significance of such a decline, it is important to keep
in mind that the centers were designed to affect the health of all
segments of the poverty population and not just infants and pregnant

women. Hence, there are many competing demands on their scarce resources: the goal of improvements in the delivery of prenatal care,
perinatal care, and care for infants under the age of one competes in
the allocation of CRC resources with the goal of improvements in the
delivery of medical care services to children beyond the age of one
and

adults.
Table 4 contains alternative summary measures to those in Table 3

of the effects of community health centers on infant mortality. Spe—
cifically, cumulative mortality differentials between counties with

— 24 —

four

or more centers and those with no centers are shown. Each race—

and age—specific differential in the table is the sum of the regression
coefficients of the four dichotomous variables in the relevant cumula-

tive model. This model is used in the computations because it embodies
more flexible assumptions about the nature of the lag structure than

the Koyck model. The figures in the table suggest a substantial payoff to counties that have pursued an aggressive policy of investment in

CHCs. For whites the total infant mortality rate in such counties
(those with four or more CHCs)

is

smaller than the rate in counties

with no centers by 1.5 deaths per thousand live births. The comparable figure for blacks is a whopping 2.9 deaths per thousand live births.
Put differently, counties that have invested substantial resources in
CHCs appear to have reduced both their white and black infant mortality
rates by 10 percent when compared to counties that have made no investments in CHCs.

Still, some caution must be exercised in interpreting these results.
We have stressed the difficulties with an empirical evaluation of as general a concept as the CHC and the techniques involved In such an evalua-

tion. For example, the regression coefficients of the CHC variables are
reduced in magnitude and lose their statistical significance when a time

trend is included in the regressions. Given the short nine—year time
span of our sample, this finding is not surprising. We wish to emphasize,
however, that pure time effects in regression models are measures of

ignorance. In this context it Is important to note that our model does
at least

as good a job in explaining variations In

rates as

a model in which eight time dummy variables alone are used as

infant

mortality

— 25 —

regressors.

Frequently, our model outperforms the pure time model based

on the relevant coefficients of determination. Clearly, more research
on the effects of CHCs on infant mortality is appropriate. Nevertheless, given the variety of evidence that we have presented and the

robustness of this evidence to alternative specifications, we feel
that

it is reasonable to conclude that there is significant evidence

that the centers have contributed to reductions in

infant

mortality.

Discussion

Since 1964 the U.S. infant mortality rate has declined at an annually compounded rate of more than 4 percent per year. This is an extremely rapid rate of decline compared to the decline of less than 1

percent per year during the prior decade, 1955 to 1964. Our study is
the latest of several to attribute important roles in the dramatic fall

in the infant mortality rate during the past two decades to a number

of public policies and programs. Using a very different methodology
from the one employed in this study, Grossman and Jacobowitz9 report
that the increase in the legal abortion rate was the single most im-

portant factor in reductions in white and black neonatal mortality

rates between 1964 and 1977. In turn, the growth in the legal abortion rate occurred because of the reform of restrictive state abortion
laws starting in 1967, the ruling by the Supreme Court in 1973 that
restrictive state laws were unconstitutional, and the Federal and state
*
funding of abortions for poor women under Medicaid, Grossman and
Jacobowitz also find that the growth in the use of organized family
planning services by low—income women due to the expansion in Federal
subsidies to clinics that deliver these services produced declines in

race—specific neonatal mortality rates. Moreover, they indicate that

*Under the Hyde Amendment, which was in effect from June 1977 until

February 1980 and continually since July 1980, Federal funding of
abortions under Medicaid is banned except in cases when the woman's

life is in danger. Note that, although we exclude the legal abortion
rate from our regressions, we control for its effects by including
the lagged infant mortality rate.

— 27 —

the delivery of prenatal and perinatal health services to poor pregnant
women by maternal and infant care projects and the financing of these
services under Medicaid caused reductions in black neonatal mortality.

Grossman and Jacobowitz's conclusions with respect to abortion and to

Medicaid financing of prenatal and perinatal care. Taken together,
these three studies and our study indicate that public financing and

delivery of medical care services (defined to include abortion services and family planning services) can have substantial impacts on
the health of the poor.

A full cost—benefit or cost—effectiveness analysis of the comsu—
nity health center program vis—a—vis other programs to reduce infant
mortality, such as the construction and subsidization of neonatal in-

tensive care units, is beyond the scope of this paper. Our results
suggest, however, that the CHC system may have a very favorable cost—

benefit ratio. The impact of the program on infant mortality, especially black infant mortality, appears to be substantial. Moreover,
the cost of the program probably is smaller than the cost of constructing and maintaining sophisticated neonatal intensive care units

if, for example, these were competing programs. In addition, the CHC
system's benefits are understated in our research because the centers
deliver services to all age—classes of low—income people and cart

affect health measures besides infant mortality.

Clearly,

our research findings are relevant with regard to the

current policy debate on the effectiveness, efficiency, and ultimate
fate of public health policy in general and the CRC system in particu-

lar. The growth of the CRC system has been curtailed sharply in real
terms by the Reagan Administration's

budget cutbacks. Although the

centers were exempted from the Administration's
the fiscal 1982 budget,

block grant program in

starting in 1983 individual states have the

option to take over the CRC program or leave it in Federal hands. In
the fiscal 1983 budget, the centers are combined with family planning

clinics, migrant health centers, and black lung clinics into a single

block grant. Moreover, a provision under which states that choose to
take control of the program must match a portion of the Federal
support

is eliminated. If the CHCs are relatively inefficient producers of
ambulatory medical care services and have little or no impact on health

levels, the policies of the Reagan Administration have some merit. On
the other hand, if the centers

are relatively efficient, the merit of

these policies can be questioned.

Our results seriously challenge the conventional wisdom that public sector production is less efficient than private sector production.

We have shown in this study that the CHC system has played an important role in recent reductions in infant

mortality, especially black

infant mortality. In addition, in another study,18we have found no
evidence that allocative inefficiency (increases
due to the use of inappropriate

in production costs

combinations of inputs) is more

— 29 —

widespread among CHCs than among private sector physicians. Although
there are statistically significant departures from cost—minimizing
behavior in the CRC system, their impacts on the cost of ambulatory

medical care are modest. To be specific, the cost saving associated
with the use of a more appropriate combination of physicians, physi-

cian aids, and medical support personnel amounts to 6 percent of the
CRC system—wide total cost of ambulatory medical care in 1980. Thus,
we conclude from our two studies that the CRC program is an effective
vehicle to achieve the goal of improvements in the health of the

poor. Substantial improvements appear to have been accomplished, and
the costs in terms of departures from the optimal utilization of in-

puts appear to be small. Our results suggest that infant mortality
rates, especially black rates, may fall more slowly than otherwise
and may even rise if the CRC program is subjected to substantial

budget cutbacks. In general this study and the related studies discussed in this section raise serious questions with regard to current
public health policy.

Appendix

Ordinary least squares regression estimates of the Koyck or short—
run model are contained in Tables Al, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, and

A9. Each table pertains to one of the nine alternative infant mortality rates. Both the dichotomous variable specification and the quadratic specification are shown. Estimates of the cumulative model are
not shown.

The notation in the tables is as follows. Variable names ending
in an asterisk denote race—specific measures.

'-• 1—' IMR1

Infant mortality rate in year t—l;
deaths of infants less than one
year old per thousand live births

2. 1't—l' NMR1

Neonatal mortality rate; deaths of
infant less than 28 days old per
thousand live births

PNNR'1

Postneonatal mortality rate; deaths
of inf ants between the ages of 28
and 364 days per thousand live births
Percentage of nonwhite births
