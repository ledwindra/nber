I. Introduction
There is considerable variation among industrialized countries in how income of married persons
is taxed. Tax systems are either individual based (independent taxation) or family based (joint
taxation). Countries with joint taxation fall into two categories - income aggregation, in which
the sum of family income is taxed as a whole (e.g., the U.S. system) or income splitting, in which
half of a couple’s income is assigned to each spouse for tax purposes. Countries with income
splitting or optional income splitting include Germany, Ireland, and Portugal. Many countries
have moved to individual rather than family based income tax, due partly to the distortionary
effects of joint taxation on labor supply and human capital investments.

Countries with

individual-based systems of taxation include Australia, Austria, Denmark, Finland, Greece,
Sweden, and the UK. Joint taxation with income aggregation is relatively uncommon, found in
Luxembourg and the US, and optional in Spain.1
In addition to distortionary effects on labor supply in married couples, some research has
argued that marriage surpluses and penalties generated by joint taxation, generally benefiting
one-earner couples and penalizing two-earner couples, can have distortionary effects on marriage
and divorce. Elimination of the “marriage tax penalty” in the U.S. has received considerable
discussion in the legislature in recent years. One aim of this paper is to contribute to that
discussion by examining behavioral responses to a switch to independent taxation – arguably the
most straightforward route to eliminating marriage tax penalties – in how married couples
allocate ownership of assets within the family.

These responses may have important

implications both for tax revenue and for the intrafamily distribution of welfare.
The United Kingdom began taxing the incomes of husbands and wives independently in
1990. Previously, all household income was pooled for the purpose of taxation. Following the

switch to independent taxation, each spouse is taxed on their own income, both earned and
unearned. As with any other tax reform that alters marginal tax rates, separate taxation should
affect “real” household behavioral outcomes that are traditionally examined by economists such
as labor supply.2 However, another effect of tax reforms is that they may create incentives for
households to exploit opportunities to reduce their tax burden by simply re-categorizing their
income without any change in real outcomes. A particularly intriguing aspect of independent
taxation in the UK is the potential for intra-household tax avoidance with respect to unearned
income. Under the new tax system, each spouse is taxed separately on his or her share of the
household investment income. Households therefore have an incentive to re-allocate shares of
investment income towards the spouse with the lower marginal tax rate in order to reduce the
overall tax burden faced by the household.
Using the UK Family Expenditure Survey data, we examine the impact of the
aforementioned tax reform on the intra-household allocation of asset income. While households
in which the marginal tax rate differs between spouses will find it advantageous to re-allocate
their assets, a number of households in which the spousal marginal tax rates are equal face no
such incentives. Thus, the identification strategy that we employ is a difference-in-difference
methodology in which we use households with no incentive to change their division of assets as
a control group to measure the impact of the tax reform for households in which the separate
taxation creates an incentive for income shifting. Furthermore, we exploit the fact that the tax
rate differential between spouses varies across households to estimate the responsiveness of
intra-household allocation of assets to the magnitude of the tax incentive.

2

Although they do not isolate the impact of separate taxation, Blundell, Duncan, and Meghir (1998) use separate
taxation along with other income tax changes in the UK to estimate labor supply parameters for married women.

4

We find a significant reallocation of household investment income among households
with an incentive to shift their assets. Not only do we find a modest increase in the proportion of
wives having any asset income among the most affected groups, but we also find a significant
increase in the fraction of household investment income held by wives, and an increase in the
fraction of households in which the wife holds all of the asset income. Our analysis indicates
that a 10 percentage point differential in the spouses’ marginal tax rates leads to a 2.6-3.1
percentage point increase in the share of investment income allocated to the spouse with the
lower marginal tax rate. However, we also find evidence that a majority of households do not
fully exploit this opportunity to reduce their tax burden.
Although tax avoidance strategies such as those analyzed in this paper are likely more
responsive to taxes (Slemrod 1996), only a small body of empirical research has examined tax
responses in outcomes other than consumption and labor supply - that is, responses which do not
involve real changes.3 The tax avoidance literature focuses on two types of avoidance strategies.
The first, timing responses, occur when households shift income to periods when tax rates are
low. Burman and Randolph (1994) find that households’ capital gains realizations are very
responsive to transitory changes in the tax rate while Randolph (1995) finds similar evidence for
charitable contributions. Goolsbee (2000) finds large increases in the taxable income of wealthy
individuals in 1992, primarily due to the cashing in of stock options, prior to the 1993 increase in
the marginal tax rates for the highest earning Americans. The second type of tax avoidance
response is through income shifting where households reclassify income in order to reduce their
tax burden. The elimination of consumer debt deductibility as part of the U.S. Tax Reform Act
of 1986 led households to reduce their consumer debt but increase their mortgage debt since it
remained deductible (Maki 1996). Gordon and Slemrod (1998) find that there has been

significant shifting of income between corporate and personal tax bases in the U.S. as the relative
tax rates have changed between these two income bases over time.

Our examination of

investment income shifting between spouses represents a contribution to this latter literature.
This work also has implications that are relevant for tax policy reforms currently being
discussed in the United States. The “marriage tax penalty” in the U.S., which recently has been
the subject of much debate, is a by-product of the system of joint spousal taxation.4 Among the
proposed reforms to eliminate the marriage penalty is the possibility of changing the U.S. tax law
to allow for the separate taxation of spouses (Alm, Dickert-Conlin, and Whittington 1999).
Although institutional factors (e.g., divorce laws) differ between the UK and the U.S., this paper
provides some evidence on the extent of the intra-household re-allocation of investment income
that can be expected in the U.S. following such a proposal. Therefore, in addition to presenting
evidence of the extent to which households take advantage of tax avoidance opportunities, the
results presented here may be useful in estimating the possible impact of separate taxation in the
U.S. on the tax revenues collected assuming households are afforded the same opportunity to
shift assets.
The paper is organized as follows: The next section discusses the UK tax reforms in more
detail. We then briefly discuss the data used for this study as well as the identification strategy
we employ. We next present our empirical results and the final section concludes.

II. The Tax Law Reforms
Prior to April 1990, the UK income tax system was a joint system based on the family.5 Spousal
income was pooled for purposes of calculating the family tax bill. In fact, all family income was

The penalty (or in some cases, subsidy) is calculated by comparing a household’s total tax burden when spouses
are taxed jointly with the taxes they would pay if they could be taxed separately.

considered to be the husband’s income. Married men received a Married Man's Allowance
(MMA, a tax exemption) which was larger than the allowance that could be claimed by an
unmarried person, the Single Person's Allowance (SPA). Unlike in the U.S. where all labor
income for a secondary earner is subject to taxation (assuming that other household income
exceeds the household’s exemption level), UK households were eligible for a Wife's Earned
Income Allowance (WEIA) which could only be applied to the wife’s labor income.6 Any labor
earnings of the wife that exceeded the WEIA was taxed jointly with other household income.
Any of the WEIA not used against the wife’s labor earnings was forfeited (i.e., any remaining
WEIA could not be used against her unearned income or any other household income). In
contrast, if the husband's taxable earnings and household unearned income were not large
enough to use all of the MMA, the remainder of this allowance could be transferred to the wife
and set against her labor earnings.7
The independent taxation of spouses began in April 1990.8

Each spouse is taxed

separately on his or her earned and unearned income. Husbands and wives are each eligible for
the entire SPA, now renamed the Personal Allowance (PA). One implication of the switch to
independent taxation is that since the MMA exceeded the SPA, its elimination would increase
the amount of taxable household income for some couples. To offset this effect, a Married
Couple's Allowance (MCA) was introduced, which was initially equal to the difference between
the SPA and the old MMA. As with the old MMA, the MCA was initially set against the
husband’s income, and any portion unused by him was transferred to the wife. Beginning in

6

The WEIA was always equal to the SPA.
Couples could opt to be taxed separately as single persons, except that all unearned income still had to be claimed
by the husband. This option, called the “wife's earnings election” resulted in the husband only being eligible for the
SPA rather than the larger MMA. Therefore, the wife's earnings election only benefited very high-income dualearner couples.

The terms “separate taxation” and “independent taxation” are used interchangeably throughout the paper.

7

1993, half or all of the married couple’s allowance could be transferred to the wife, even if the
husband had sufficient income to use all of it. The MCA gradually decreased in real value over
the 1990s, due both to erosion from inflation and to a phase-out through limits on the maximum
benefit from the allowance. The MCA was finally eliminated for the tax year beginning in April
2000. Appendix Table 1 contains the tax rates and allowances in the years surrounding the
introduction of separate taxation.
In this paper we are interested in the implications of separate taxation for the intrahousehold allocation of asset income.9 Prior to this tax reform, the allocation of assets within the
household did not matter for income taxation purposes since all investment income was
considered to belong to the husband. Following the tax reform, however, households could
legally shift assets between the spouses. Households have two options available to them in order
to shift assets. First, they can entirely shift an asset from one spouse to another by giving the
asset as a gift. Although there are transactions costs involved with completely signing over an
asset, there are no capital gains taxes incurred at the time when assets are given as a gift between
spouses.10 The second possibility involves jointly owned assets. The default split of joint assets
for taxation is an even 50-50 split. However, spouses may legally designate an alternate division
of joint assets and each spouse is taxed respectively on his or her share of the income generated
by that asset.11
Since households are allowed to reallocate asset income between the two spouses, the
switch to independent taxation gave couples an incentive to transfer assets to the spouse with the

9

Asset income refers to interest and/or dividends from banks, building societies, stocks, and bonds as well as
property income.
10
If the spouse receiving the gift subsequently disposes of the asset, the capital gains tax is calculated based upon
the date and value of the asset when the asset was initially acquired by the household.
11
In order to make a declaration of asset transfer for income tax purposes, including declaring some division of joint
ownership other than 50/50, Form 17 must be completed and signed by both spouses and filed with Inland Revenue.

lower marginal tax rate in order to reduce the household’s tax burden.

In many

households, this reform created an incentive to transfer a portion or even all of the household’s
assets to the wife since she faces the lower marginal tax rate. Furthermore, if she works very
little or not at all, then the asset income shifted to her may not be taxed at all. Thus, we expect
that following independent taxation, the fraction of wives with investment income as well as the
wives’ share of investment income will increase.
A minor but important “quirk” occurred during the shift to independent taxation. During
the first year of independent taxation, the personal allowance could not be used to offset taxes on
some types of asset income.12 Thus, shifting these assets to a non-working spouse would not
have reduced the household’s tax burden. This feature of the tax law was estimated to have
affected five million married women with income less than their personal allowance (H.M.
Treasury 1995). Beginning April 1991, however, all interest income became eligible to be set
against the personal allowance. We will return to the importance of this secondary change for
identifying the impact of separate taxation.

III. Empirical Methods
III. A. Data
The Family Expenditure Survey (FES) is an annual survey of UK households, a repeated crosssection dataset that has been consistently collected across multiple decades.13

The FES is

conducted primarily for the purpose of constructing weights for the Retail Price Index, but the
data are also intended for research purposes. The survey is ongoing throughout the year, and the

12

Specifically, interest from banks, building societies, and other deposit-takers could not be set against the personal
allowance.
13
The data are collected by the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys Social Survey Division for the
Department of Employment and the Central Statistical Office. The data are maintained by the Economic and Social
Research Council Data Archive at the University of Essex, http://dawww.essex.ac.uk/.

9

calendar month (or in some earlier years, week of the year) of the interview is reported. We are
therefore able to construct data samples based on the tax year, which as we indicated previously
runs from April through March.14 A random sample of ten thousand households is selected each
year, approximately seventy percent of which complete the survey. One or more face-to-face
interviews are conducted with at least one household member.15 Information collected includes
household and personal expenditures, household demographics, and individual labor supply
along with income and its sources. We use the monthly Retail Price Index, obtained from the
Office for National Statistics, to construct an annual price index for each tax year and convert all
monetary values in the data to a constant currency, the 1993-94 tax year £.
For our empirical analysis, we use data spanning from April 1984 through March 1998.
However, in order to minimize the number of factors unrelated to the tax law change that may
confound the time series changes that we use to identify the impact of separate taxation, a
majority of our analysis restricts the number of years that we allow to three-year pre- and postreform periods. The three tax years from April 1987 to March 1990 (inclusive) represent the
period before the switch to independent taxation. The three tax years from April 1991 to March
1994 (inclusive) represent the post-reform period. As we mentioned in the previous section,
there was a one-year lag before independent taxation was “fully” implemented in the sense that
some investment income could not be set against an individual’s personal allowance for the first
tax year following independent taxation. We therefore consider April 1990 to March 1991 to be
a transition period and omit this time frame from our analysis. Finally, since the UK tax system

14

The public use data were available on a calendar year basis through calendar year 1993, at which time it began
being distributed on a tax year basis.
15
Through 1993 the FES was collected using paper and pencil interviews. Beginning in April 1994, the collection
of these data switched to using a Computer Aided Personal Interviewing (CAPI) method.

10

has allowances that are based on the age of the husband and wife, we limit our sample to
households in which both spouses are between the ages of 20 and 60.

III. B. Identification Strategy
In order to identify the impact of separate taxation on the intra-household investment income
allocation, we must first be able to identify the group of households for whom independent
taxation presented the opportunity to engage in income shifting. Ideally, a panel dataset that
spans the period before and after independent taxation would be available to use for our analysis.
Using such a dataset, we could identify households in which the spouses’ marginal tax rates
differ following separate taxation as well as those households in which the marginal rates are
equal. For each of these two groups of households, we could calculate their asset allocations
both before and after separate taxation became effective. Under the assumption that no other
behaviors (e.g., labor supply) were changed due to the tax reform, causing households to shift
between these two groups, the impact of the tax reform could be estimated by comparing the
relative magnitudes of the changes in asset allocations for these two groups across the two time
periods. Unfortunately, no such dataset is available.
The FES provides us with a repeated cross-section of households before and after the
switch to independent taxation. We can easily estimate the marginal tax rates for each spouse in
the post-reform period since separate taxation is in effect. We are then able to group households
in the post-reform period based upon whether the spouses’ marginal tax rates are equal or if they
differ. The difficulty we face is constructing groups of households in the pre-reform period to
use as the “before” portion in a difference-in-difference estimator. We cannot simply apply the
tax code in, say, the 1988-89 tax year in order to calculate separate marginal tax rates for
husbands and wives in the 1988-89 tax year. Our approach for overcoming this difficulty is to

11

take the tax code in the post-reform period and apply it to households in the pre-reform period.
In particular, we take the tax code from the 1991-92 tax year (the first year of our post-reform
period) and apply it to the pre-reform period.16 We are then able to estimate marginal tax rates
for households in the pre-reform period which in turn allows us to construct the counterfactual
“before” groups for our difference-in-difference estimator.17
In order for this approach of applying the post-reform code to the pre-reform period to
work, we must operate under the assumption that households in the pre-reform period would not
have adjusted other dimensions of their behavior, most importantly their labor supply, if they
actually faced the post-reform tax code. While this assumption is not innocuous, we do not
believe it will have a strong impact upon our results. For the majority of married men in our
sample, the switch to separate taxation did not affect their marginal tax rate (under the
assumption of a secondary earner model). Also, since only two marginal tax rates exist for most
of the time periods analyzed, relatively small changes in labor supply will not cause these men to
switch tax brackets. Furthermore, the literature on male labor supply elasticities consistently
finds very small wage and income elasticities for men (Blundell and MaCurdy 2000). Thus, the
assumption that independent taxation had a negligible effect on male labor supply and, more
importantly, the marginal tax rates these men face is likely not far from the truth.
Married women, on the other hand, may have faced larger changes in their marginal tax
rates. However, one must remember that prior to independent taxation, married women only
faced taxes on their labor income above their own allowance amount (the WEIA) and not on
their first pound earned. If there are no fixed costs of work, or if these costs are relatively small,

16

We use the appropriate deflator from the RPI to adjust the nominal tax brackets in 1991-92 tax code when we
apply the tax code to the pre-reform years.
17
We also created marginal tax rates in pre-reform years by applying that year’s tax system to each spouse as if
independent taxation was in effect. Analysis using these marginal rates is very similar to the results presented here.

12

married women did not face tax disincentives from participating in the labor force prior to
independent taxation and the switch to independent taxation would not have increased the
incentives to entering the labor force for married women. But even if the fixed costs to entering
the labor force are substantial, the switch to independent taxation would have only affected the
budget constraint for a small number of women. For women married to men in the 0% or 25%
marginal tax bracket, the tax reform did not change their marginal tax rate on their first pound
earned above the exemption amount. Women married to men in the 40% marginal tax bracket
saw their marginal rate (above the exempt amount) fall from 40% to 25% following independent
taxation. Thus, there might have been an incentive for a small group of women to enter the labor
force following independent taxation – women married to very high income men and facing
substantial fixed costs of work.
The married women who potentially faced the largest incentives to adjust their labor
supply were already in the labor force. However, as with the participation margin, the women
who faced changes in their marginal tax rates above the exempt amount were those women
married to men in the 40% tax bracket. Furthermore, estimates of labor supply elasticities for
working married women are relatively small (Mroz 1987; Triest 1990). In addition, Blundell,
Duncan, and Meghir (1998), using UK tax reforms, including the one examined here, have found
relatively small labor supply elasticities for married women in the UK. Overall, any labor supply
responses for married women likely were small.
Under the assumption that the labor supply responses by both spouses to separate
taxation are small, our strategy for identifying the “before” groups will impart at most a small
bias on our estimates of the intra-household shifting of investment income. In an attempt to
control for potential biases due to possible labor supply responses that we have outlined above,
we also present regression estimates in which we include a variety of demographic controls that

13

are correlated with labor supply behavior. While these regressions will not capture all of the
potential biases due to labor supply changes, they will indicate whether the results are robust to
minor compositional changes between the different groups.
The marginal tax rates for each spouse are calculated using his or her own income, both
earned and unearned. However, precisely because they are engaging in tax avoidance behavior,
households should attempt to equalize the marginal tax rates on their last dollar of income. Thus,
the observed marginal tax rate on the last dollar of income will obscure the incentives
households have for shifting investment income between spouses. We therefore determine
marginal tax rates on all income except investment income. Households in which the spouses
have equal marginal rates on their own incomes excluding investment income will have no
incentive to re-allocate their investment income following independent taxation. Households in
which these marginal tax rates differ will be induced to shift investment income between
spouses.

III. C. Estimating the Impact of Separate Taxation on the Allocation of Assets
After we have determined the marginal tax rates for households in the pre- and post-reform
periods, we are able to examine the impact of separate taxation on the intra-household allocation
of assets. However, unlike a standard difference-in-difference approach in which the incentives
of the treatment induce similar behavior throughout a single treatment group, our analysis has
two treatment groups with exactly opposite incentives due to separate taxation. In households in
which the husband’s marginal tax rate exceeds the wife’s rate, the tax reform will induce a shift
of investment income away from husbands and towards wives. However, in households in
which the wife’s marginal rate exceeds the husband’s rate, the switch to separate taxation had the
exact opposite effect. These households should shift investment income towards the husbands.

14

The latter treatment group encompasses only a very small fraction of all households both before
and after the tax reform. Thus, while we include these households in all of our empirical
analyses, the impact of separate taxation is identified primarily by households in which the
husband’s marginal rate is higher.
To examine the impact of separate taxation on the intra-household allocation of
investment income, we focus on a variety of outcomes related to the distribution of investment
income within households. We first examine the impact on the fraction of households in which
wives have a non-zero share of investment income as well as the fraction of households in which
the husband has a non-zero share. In the predominant case where the husband’s marginal rate
exceeds the wife’s, we not only expect there to be an increase in the fraction of wives having a
non-zero share of investment income, but we also anticipate an increase in the fraction of
households in which the husband has no investment income.18 The reason for this latter switch is
that in cases where the husband’s income excluding investment income greatly exceeds the
wife’s, there is an incentive to shift all of the investment income to the wife, leaving the husband
with none. In addition, we examine the impact of separate taxation on the average share of
investment income held by wives. In the predominant case in which the husband’s rate is higher,
independent taxation induced households to increase the share of investment income held by
wives. Finally, we present evidence of the tax reform’s impact on the entire distribution of the
investment income shares held by wives rather than just focusing on the shift in the mean share
of investment income.
Our difference-in-difference methodology proceeds in two phases. First, we form three
groups: a control group in which the spouses have equal marginal tax rates, and the two

18

We limit our discussion of the expected impacts to the predominant case, where the husband’s marginal tax rate
exceeds the wife’s, for ease of exposition. We expect an exactly opposite set of responses for households in which
the wife’s marginal tax rate exceeds the husband’s.

15

treatment groups – one in which the husband has the higher marginal tax rate (Treatment Group
1) and another in which the wife has the higher marginal tax rate (Treatment Group 2). We first
examine changes in the aforementioned outcome measures for the two treatment groups relative
to the changes for the control group. However, we are also able to exploit an additional source
of variation. Since the UK tax structure consists of multiple marginal tax bands, the magnitude
of the difference in the marginal tax rates will vary across households. The larger the difference
in the marginal tax rates, the stronger will be the incentive for households to re-allocate their
investment income. We therefore also examine a modified difference-in-difference methodology
that incorporates the magnitude of the marginal tax rate differences within the household.19
Table 1 presents some summary statistics for households in the pre- and post-reform
groups. The top of the panel divides households in the pre-reform period into the control group
and the two treatment groups. A similar breakdown is shown at the bottom of the table for
households in the post-reform period. The characteristics of the households in each group across
the two time periods are very similar.20 The households in the post-reform period are slightly
older and more educated although these differences exist across all three groups and is therefore
not indicative of a shifting of households between groups. More interesting are the relative
stability of the hours of work across the two time periods within each group. While these
summary statistics are not definitive, they do suggest that the composition of the groups
remained relatively stable over time.

19

The 1992 tax year introduction of the lower rate of 20% on the initial amount of income creates a minor difficulty
for our construction of the tax difference groups. Also, the basic rate fell to 24% in 1996 and 23% in 1997. For
consistency throughout our analysis, we treat anyone with a tax rate between 20% and 25%, inclusive, as having a
tax rate of 25%.
20
Restricting the households in Table 1 to only those with investment income also shows that the characteristics of
each of the groups remains stable over time.

16

IV. Empirical Evidence of the Impact of Separate Taxation on Asset Allocation
IV. A. Long-Run Trends in Intra-Household Asset Allocations
To get a picture of the time-series impacts of independent taxation, we first present time-series
evidence to demonstrate that the timing of the shift in investment income occurs when
independent taxation is implemented. If there was a long-term demographic trend towards wives
possessing a larger fraction of household investment income that differed between the treatment
and control groups, then our difference-in-difference strategy may lead us to infer that separate
taxation had a causal effect when in fact all we are picking up in our before/after analysis is the
trend differences. However, sharp breaks in the time series of our measures of intra-household
asset allocation are suggestive of a causal interpretation for our difference-in-difference
estimator.
Figure 1 (a) shows the fraction of households in our sample which have some investment
income, and the fraction of households in which the wife reports some such income for the tax
years ranging from 1984-85 through 1997-98. Over this period, the fraction of households
holding investment income slightly increases and then, somewhat surprisingly, declines over this
period.21 However, there are no dramatic shifts that would suggest that the composition of the
group of households with investment income changes over this period. The time series for the
fraction of wives holding some investment income parallels the fraction of households with
investment income. There appears to be a slight closing in the gap between these two lines
suggesting that wives are more likely to be holding investment income in households with
investment income. However, there is no dramatic shift in the fraction of wives with investment
income visible from this figure. Panel (b) of Figure 1 shows the fraction of households having
some investment income by tax rate difference groups. The two groups shown are households
21

Banks, Dilnot, and Low (1995) find similar evidence of this decline using a separate data set.

17

where the spouses’ marginal tax rates are equal and those where the husband’s rate is higher.22
This figure reveals that the fraction of households with investment income is similar for these
two groups.

More importantly, time-series changes in the fraction of households with

investment income are in the same direction for both groups. Although Panel (a) finds a decline
in the aggregate fraction of households with investment income, Panel (b) indicates that this
decline did not differ between the treatment and control groups.
Figure 2 provides some visual evidence that independent taxation caused a shift in the
allocation of investment income between spouses. Panel (a) shows the fraction of wives holding
any investment income for the tax rate difference groups. Prior to 1991, wives were more likely
to have investment income in households in which the spouses’ marginal rates were equal.
Moreover, this gap was relatively constant. Beginning in 1991, however, the two series are
essentially equal and remain that way throughout the remainder of the sample period. This shift
is consistent with the prediction that independent taxation caused a shifting of investment income
towards wives in households in which her marginal tax rate is lower than that of her husband.
Although independent taxation began in 1990, one’s tax allowance could not be used to offset
some forms of investment income during the first year of the reform. Furthermore, since
independent taxation is in effect in 1990, we use the tax structure in that year to determine the
marginal tax rates of each spouse. Thus, the shift that occurs between 1990 and 1991 is not
related to our procedure of assigning the post-reform tax structure to the pre-reform years. The
delay in fully implementing separate taxation, therefore, provides additional leverage in
identifying the effect of separate taxation.

22

Due to the small size and the resulting sampling variability, time series plots of asset allocations in households
where the wife’s marginal rate is higher appear to be somewhat erratic. Adding this group does not add any
information, but rather it obscures patterns one might see for the other two groups. Therefore, we have omitted this
group from the figures in which we plot the asset allocation outcomes. However, this group is included in all of the
estimation that we perform.

18

The exact opposite effect can be seen for husbands in Panel (b) of Figure 2. Prior to
1991, husbands consistently were more likely to have some investment income in households in
which they had higher marginal tax rates than their spouses. However, beginning in 1991, the
two time series become essentially equal for all subsequent years. These two panels indicate that
separate taxation induced households to shift investment income away from husbands and
toward wives when there became a tax advantage for doing so.
The incentives for income shifting are only present for households that have some
investment income. Therefore in the remainder of our analysis we restrict our attention to this
subset of households. Figure 3 presents the same time-series plots as in Figure 2 but with this
new restriction imposed upon the sample. Again we find noticeable and consistent gaps in the
fraction of spouses having any investment income prior to the tax reform. Once separate taxation
begins, these gaps between the treatment and control groups disappear.
Finally, Figure 4 presents the time-series plots for the share of the household’s
investment income that is held by the wife. Prior to separate taxation, wives consistently held a
smaller share of investment income in households where they had the lower marginal tax rate
relative to wives in households with marginal tax rates equal to that of their husbands.
Beginning in 1991, as would be expected given the evidence in the previous figures, there is an
increase in the fraction of investment income held by wives in households who should be
induced to shift income following the tax reform. In the post-reform era, there are no differences
in the wife’s share of investment income between the treatment and control groups.
These time-series plots presented in Figures 1-4 indicate that separate taxation had a
causal effect on the intra-household allocation of assets. All of the asset allocation measures
show relatively stable differences between the treatment and control groups throughout the pre-

19

reform period.

However, beginning precisely at the time independent taxation becomes

effective, these gaps no longer exist.

IV. B. Distributional Effects of Independent Taxation
Another graphical approach to analyze the impact of separate taxation on the intra-household
allocations of assets is to directly examine the distributions of investment income before and
after the tax reform. We first limit our sample to households in the pre-reform (tax years 19871989) and post-reform (tax years 1991-1993) periods. Then, within each of our tax rate
difference groups, we examine how independent taxation affected the distribution of the wife’s
share of investment income among those households with investment income.
Figure 5 (a) presents the cumulative distribution function of the wife’s share of
investment income for households in which the husband’s and wife’s marginal rates are equal.23
Since independent taxation should not have affected the distribution of assets within these
households, we expect the CDFs to be equal in the pre- and post-reform periods. As the figure
shows, the two CDFs appear to be nearly identical. We can test for the equality of these two
CDFs using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test. The KS test statistic for the equality of these two
distributions is 0.025 with a p-value of 0.242. Confirming our visual evidence, we cannot reject
the hypothesis that the CDF did not change following independent taxation for households in
which the spouses’ marginal rates are equal.
The CDFs for the households in which the husband’s marginal tax rate is higher are
shown in Figure 5 (b). Since the impact of the tax reform induced these households to shift
investment income towards wives, the CDF for the post-reform period should exhibit first-order

23

Figures 5 (a) and (b) are derived by plotting the CDF at every .025 along the horizontal axis. Due to the small
sample sizes available, Figure 5 (c) is derived by plotting the CDF at every 0.05 along the horizontal axis.

20

stochastic dominance over the pre-reform CDF. From the Figure, it appears that the results are
consistent with this hypothesis. The KS test statistic for the equality of these CDFs is 0.146 with
a p-value less than 0.01. Furthermore, the test statistic for first order stochastic dominance is
also 0.146 with a p-value less than 0.01. Thus, independent taxation shifted distribution of assets
in the expected direction for households in Treatment Group 1.
Finally, for households in which the wife’s marginal rate exceeds the husband’s, that the
pre-reform CDF should stochastically dominate the post-reform CDF. By examining Figure 5
(c), it appears that this hypothesis is true for values of the wife’s fraction of investment income
exceeding 50%. However, the left-hand side of the distribution exhibits exactly the opposite
behavior. The KS test statistic for the equality of these CDFs is 0.067 with a p-value of 0.654
and we are unable to reject the equality of the two distributions for these households.
These cumulative distribution functions further suggest that the switch to independent
taxation had the hypothesized effects on the intra-household allocation of investment income.
The CDFs shifted in the hypothesized direction for our largest treatment group, the one where
the husband has the higher tax rate. Equally as important, the CDFs remain constant over time
for the control group, further suggesting that the switch to independent taxation had a causal
effect on the intra-household shifts in investment income.

IV. C. Difference-in-Difference Estimates
Table 2 presents difference-in-difference estimates of the impact of separate taxation on the
fraction of wives and the fraction of husbands with investment income among the households
with any investment income. As we previously mentioned, the pre-reform period is limited to
April 1987-March 1990 while the post-reform period is April 1991-March 1994. The top panel
of the table presents the impact of separate taxation for the control group in which the spouses’

21

marginal tax rates are equal. The fraction of wives with investment income increases by less than
one percentage point (from 86.4% to 87.4%) and this change is statistically insignificant.
Similarly, the change in the fraction of husbands with investment income is roughly one
percentage point (from 87.9% to 89.1%) and is also insignificant. We also present changes for
sub-groups within our control group by further grouping households by their marginal tax rates.
Within these sub-groups, the only (marginally) statistically significant change is found for the
fraction of wives with investment income in households where both spouses face a marginal tax
rate of 40%. Overall, however, we do not find any evidence that separate taxation impacted the
distribution of investment income within the control group.
The middle panel of Table 2 presents the results for households in which the husband’s
marginal tax rate exceeds the wife’s. There is a significant increase in the fraction of wives with
any investment income and an even larger decline in the fraction of husbands with investment
income following separate taxation. The difference-in-difference estimates at the bottom of the
panel compare these changes with the changes in the control group.

Both difference-in-

difference estimates are statistically significant and are consistent with tax avoidance behavior.
Examining the sub-group differences gives an indication of how the tax reform differentially
affected households within Treatment Group 1. The most interesting of these sub-group changes
is in the fraction of husbands with any investment income in households where the wife has a
marginal tax rate of zero. In both of these groups, a significant fraction of households appear to
be taking advantage of the opportunity to avoid taxes by shifting all of their investment income
to the wife.
The bottom panel of the table presents the results for Treatment Group 2, those
households in which the wife’s marginal tax rate exceeds the husband’s.

Although these

households are small in number, which makes finding statistically significant results difficult for

22

this group, we do find evidence which is consistent with income shifting. The fraction of wives
with investment income falls while the fraction of husbands with investment income shows an
increase, although neither change is significant. Neither of the difference-in-difference results
shown at the bottom of the panel is significant although they are both of the hypothesized sign.
Furthermore, for two of the three sub-groups, the changes are of the hypothesized sign. The
exception is for households in which the wife’s marginal rate is 40% while the husband’s rate is
zero, but these changes are insignificant.
The difference-in-difference results for the wife’s share of the household’s investment
income are presented in Table 3. As the top panel of the table indicates, the reform did not have
an effect on the mean distribution of assets within households where the spouses have the same
marginal tax rate. The middle panel of the table shows that there is a strongly significant effect
within households where the husband’s marginal rate is higher. This re-allocation of assets
occurs across all three of the sub-groups. Most interestingly, the effect is the strongest for
households in which the marginal rates differ the most (the husband’s rate is 40% and the wife’s
rate is zero). The bottom panel shows results consistent with the income shifting hypothesis
although the results are insignificant. The share of investment income going to the wife falls
within households where the wife’s marginal tax rate is higher. Thus, the simple difference-indifference results in Tables 2 and 3 are consistent with separate taxation causing a re-allocation
of the investment income within households where the incentives for shifting investment income
exist. Furthermore, households with the largest tax rate differentials are engaging in the most
income shifting.
Although the evidence presented thus far is consistent with a causal interpretation for the
role separate taxation had on the distribution of investment income within households, our
estimates may be affected by underlying demographic trends that potentially plague any

23

difference-in-difference estimator. Furthermore, our estimates may be affected by labor supply
responses to the tax change. Therefore, we also present difference-in-difference regression
estimates for the outcomes shown in Tables 2 and 3 that include demographic controls, as well as
without these controls in order to ascertain the robustness of the tax-reform estimates.24
These regression results are presented in Table 4. For each of the outcomes, we allow the
responses to differ for the two treatment groups as we did in simple difference-in-difference
results in Tables 2 and 3.25

For ease of interpretation, we set the dummy variable for

membership in the Treatment Group 2 (the wife’s marginal rate exceeds the husband’s) equal to
–1. Thus, all of the difference-in-difference coefficients should have the same sign as the
theoretical prediction for the treatment group in which the husband’s marginal rate is higher. For
example, in column 3 of Table 4, the coefficients in the bottom two rows measure the impact of
separate taxation on the fraction of husbands with investment income. The impact for the
treatment group in which the husband’s marginal rate exceeds the wife’s is negative and
significant (-0.061) as we also saw in Table 2. The coefficient for the other treatment group is
also negative, but it is “correctly-signed” because all of the dummy variables for this group are
set equal to –1.
For Treatment Group 1, the results are consistent with the income shifting hypothesis and
statistically significant. We find an increase in the fraction of wives with investment income, a
decrease in the fraction of husbands with investment income, and an increase in the share of
investment income held by the wife. In addition, the results are fairly robust to the inclusion of

24

The regressions with demographic controls include a quadratic in the head’s age; a quadratic in the wife’s age;
number of children; number of children under 5; the wife’s and husband’s years of education; year effects for 1988,
1989, 1992, and 1993; and regional dummies for Greater London, Wales, Scotland, and Ireland.
25
Although we allow the responses to differ between the two groups, we will not exactly replicate the difference-indifference results in the prior tables. The reason is that we constrain the “Post-Reform” variable to be the same for
both treatment groups. Even so, our baseline results without controls are nearly identical to the previous results.

24

demographic controls. For Treatment Group 2, the results for the fraction of husbands with
investment income and the wife’s share of investment income are “correctly-signed” and robust
to the inclusion of demographic controls. However, none of the point estimates for this group
are statistically significant.
Thus far our regression results have focused on whether the outcomes for each treatment
group have change in the hypothesized direction and the statistical significance of the estimated
effect. In order to better quantify these outcomes, we estimate how the magnitude of the
spouses’ tax rate differential affects the magnitude of investment income shifting between the
spouses. We replace the dummy variable for treatment group membership with the actual
difference in the husband’s and the wife’s marginal tax rates and re-estimate the regression
models for all three outcomes.
Table 5 presents the results that examine the impact of the tax rate differential on the
intra-household asset allocation. Notice that the sign of the estimated coefficients in Table 5 is
the same as those found for the analogous effects in Table 4.26 Since the sign of actual tax rate
difference is the same as that of the treatment group variables used in Table 4, the estimated
coefficients are generally of the same sign as those we previously found. In addition, the
estimated coefficients of interest show the same pattern of significance as in Table 4.
We can estimate how much an increase in the tax rate differential between the spouses
will cause the household to shift investment income between the spouses using the results shown
in Table 5. In column 6, results for households in which the husband’s marginal rate exceeds the
wife’s rate indicate that a 10 percentage point increase in the tax rate differential between the two
spouses leads to a 3.1 percentage point increase in the share of investment income held by the

26

The coefficients for households in which the wife’s marginal rate exceeds the husband’s must again be carefully
interpreted when the responses for each treatment group are reported separately.

25

wife. In results not shown here, a comparable estimate in which we pool the estimate for both
treatment groups indicates a 2.6 percentage point increase.27 At the maximum tax rate difference
of 40 percentage points, our results imply that the fraction of household investment income
shifted to the spouse with the lower marginal rate would be between 10 and 12 percentage
points.

IV. D. Robustness Checks
While the results we have presented thus far provide fairly convincing evidence that the switch
to independent taxation caused a shift in investment income between spouses, it is possible that
other factors may be influencing our results. One possibility is that households could be taking
advantage of another opportunity to lower their tax burden by shifting assets, namely through the
use of capital gains exemptions. Prior to independent taxation, a household only received one
exemption to set against any capital gains. The introduction of independent taxation led to each
spouse having their own capital gains exemption. Furthermore, the capital gain exemption is
rather sizable; it was 5000£ in tax year 1990 while the personal exemption for income in the
same tax year was 3005£. On the one hand, such a sizable exemption may lead households to
shift investment to the spouse in order to increase the size of their gain that is exempt for
taxation.

On the other hand, given such a large exemption, households may not have an

incentive to shift assets since the size of one exemption alone may cover their capital gains.
However, there still exists the possibility that households shift investment income primarily to
take advantage of the capital gains exemption and not to take advantage of the lower marginal
tax rate.

27

Due to the presence of households in which the wife’s fraction of investment is zero or one, we cannot use a log
dependent variable to more easily estimate elasticities of income shifting.

26

To investigate this issue further, we divide our measure of investment income into three
components. The first component is savings income (bank deposits), which is only taxable as
income and is not subject to taxation as a capital gain. The second component is stocks and
bonds. These may generate interest and dividend income that is subject to regular income tax.
However, these items may also generate capital gains when sold and therefore may be shifted
between spouses to take advantage of the capital gains exemption. The final component is
property income. Again, while property income is subject to regular income tax, real property
may also generate a capital gain upon its disposal.
Table 6 examines the impact of independent taxation on the wife’s share of each of these
components using the specification with the magnitude of the difference in the spouses’
investment income. The first two columns present the results for savings income.28 These
estimates are roughly identical to those for all investment income shown in Table 5.
Furthermore, the results for the group in which the wife’s rate exceeds the husband’s are now
positive although they are insignificant.
The results for stocks and bonds shown in the next two columns are of the expected sign,
but all the results are insignificant. Part of the reason that the results are insignificant is the
reduction in the sample size for these regressions.29 Even so, the magnitude of the shift of these
assets is far less than the results we find for savings income. For property income, shown in the
last two columns, we again find correctly-signed but statistically insignificant results. Thus,
while households may be shifting some of their assets to take advantage of the capital gains

28

Some types of bank deposits (TESSAs and the first 70 pounds of interest income from ordinary accounts with the
National Savings Bank) are not subject to income tax. Results from regressions in which these types of deposits are
removed are nearly identical to those presented here.
29
Only 25% of households in the pre- and post-reform sample have stocks or bonds while 72% have savings
income.

27

exemptions, our results are primarily driven by savings income that is not subject to capital gains
tax.
Another concern is the relationship between the household’s marginal tax rate differential
and the amount of the household’s investment income. If households with the largest tax gains
from shifting investment income are also those that have the largest amounts of investment
income, part of the shifting incentive that we attribute to the tax rate differential may be due to
the fact that these households with higher levels are more likely to shift their income. To
investigate this issue, we divided households into quartiles based upon the amount of their
investment income. We then re-estimated the outcomes in Table 5 for each investment income
quartile in a pooled regression.30
The results of estimating these models are presented in Table 7. Across investment
income quartiles, the increase in wives receiving investment income appears to come in the
lower end of the distribution (columns 1 and 2). However, none of the estimated effects are
statistically significant. In addition, the Wald test statistic testing the equality of the differencein-difference regression coefficients cannot reject the hypothesis that the effects are the same
across the quartiles. The results in columns 3 and 4 of the table indicate that the tax-differential
effect of shifting investment income entirely away from the husband is most prevalent in the
lowest investment income quartile.

The Wald test statistic rejects the equality of these

coefficients across investment income quartiles.

As the household’s investment income

increases, the less likely it is that the household will shift all of the investment income to the
wife. The final two columns of Table 7 present results for the wife’s share of investment
income.

These results appear to indicate that the tax differential has a larger effect for

30

We also estimated models in which we interacted the tax rate differential with the level of investment income.
The results of these models provide similar qualitative results to those found in Table 7.

28

households with the most investment income. However, the Wald test statistics cannot reject the
hypothesis that the effects are the same across quartiles.
Our results suggest that the response to the tax rate differential varies dramatically across
the investment income distribution. Households with a small amount of investment income are
more likely to respond by shifting assets entirely between spouses. Households with more
investment income, on the other hand, do not appear to be taking full advantage of the tax rate
differential by shifting assets entirely between spouses. Instead, these households respond to the
tax incentives by re-allocating the share of investment income between the two spouses.
As a final robustness check, we examined the fraction of households reporting an even
50-50 split of investment income.31 In the pre-reform period, the average amount of the wife’s
fraction of investment income was less than 50 percent, especially for households in which the
husband’s marginal rate exceeds the wife’s.

Since the default split of jointly held assets

following independent taxation is 50-50, the increase in the wife’s share of investment income
that we find may be simply due to an increase in households reporting the default split of these
assets. However, by examining the CDFs in Figure 5, one can see that the percentage of
households in which the wife has 50% of investment income remained constant in the control
groups while it appears to fall in the two treatment groups. Furthermore, in results not shown
here, using the fraction of households reporting a 50-50 split of investment income as the
dependent variable in our difference-in-difference framework, we find that this fraction
significantly decreases for Treatment Group 1 relative to the control group while there is no
relative change for Treatment Group 2.

Therefore, this mechanical relationship is not

responsible for the results that we find.

31

To account for measurement error, we also estimated models where we examined the fraction of households
reporting the wife’s share of investment income as being between 45% and 55%. The results were very similar.

29

IV. E. Are Households “Optimally” Re-Allocating Assets?
Although we find evidence that households responded to the incentives for shifting investment
income, another question one might be interested in asking is whether households “optimally”
respond to these incentives. Of course, the definition of optimal can vary depending upon the
model of household structure (e.g., unitary vs. bargaining model) one wishes to impose and
institutional factors (e.g. divorce laws) affecting the household’s decision processes. For our
purposes, we define the optimal allocation of investment income as the one that minimizes the
household’s tax burden. While the actual optimal allocation may differ due to the reasons listed
above, our approach answers a natural baseline question concerning impact of the tax rate
differential on the household’s investment income allocation.
Before we attempt to answer the question concerning how far households are away from
their optimal allocation, it is useful to understand the minimum share of investment income that
should be allocated to the spouse with the lower marginal tax rate. In other words, we determine
the minimum share of the household’s investment income that needs to be allocated to the
spouse with the lower marginal tax rate in order for the spouses to just equalize their (final
dollar) marginal tax rates. This calculation is useful for two purposes. First, it allows us to
estimate the minimum amount of re-allocation that we would expect to see. Second, we are
interested in how a household’s own efforts can move it closer to its optimal allocation. If the
tax brackets are not perfectly indexed over time, then a household could conceivably move
closer to (or further away from) its optimal allocation following independent taxation without
any changes in its allocation of investment income.
Figure 6 presents the CDFs for the minimum share of investment income that the
treatment households would need to shift in order to just equalize marginal tax rates. Panel (a)
presents the results for households in which the husband’s rate exceeds the wife’s in both the

30

pre- and post-reform periods. Two striking facts can be seen in this figure. The first is that over
90% of these households would need to allocate all of their investment income to the wife in
order to take full advantage of the tax incentive. The second is that the minimum share that
needs to be shifted in the pre- and post-reform periods is almost identical. This observation is
confirmed by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistic for the equality of these two CDFs which is
0.016 with a p-value of 0.806. The results for households in which the wife’s marginal rate
exceeds the husband’s, shown in Panel (b), also show that a large majority of households would
optimize by shifting all of their investment income to the spouse with the lower marginal tax
rate. However, the K-S test statistic for the pre- and post-reform CDFs can (marginally) reject
the equality of these two distributions (p-value = 0.099).
We then calculate the additional share of investment income that needs to be shifted to
the spouse with the lower marginal tax rate. These results are shown in Figure 7. For Treatment
Group 1 (Panel (a)), a greater percentage of households is closer to their optimal allocation in the
post-reform period relative to the pre-reform period. The K-S test statistic for the equality of the
CDFs is 0.141 with a p-value less than 0.01. However, although a significant number of
households moved closer to the optimal allocation of assets, only 18% of households optimally
allocated their assets.
Panel (b) of Figure 7 shows the additional shifting necessary for households in which the
wife’s rate is higher. The interesting result for these households is that as a group they were
closer to their optimal allocations in the pre-reform period. However, as Figure 6 (b) indicates,
the minimum re-allocation necessary in the pre-reform period also was smaller. Since our
previous results found no significant change in their allocation of investment income, it appears
that other changes are moving them further from the optimal allocation. As with the other
treatment group, the share of households optimizing their allocation of investment income is

31

surprising small. In the post-reform period, 30% of these households are choosing the correct
allocation.
This last set of results suggests that although households did respond to the incentives
present in the tax reform to re-allocate their assets, they are not taking full advantage of their
ability to do so. As we previously discussed, the failure of so many households to choose the
“optimal” allocation may be due to spouses optimizing along other dimensions other than just
minimizing their tax burden. Understanding the reasons why households do not choose the
optimal allocation is an interesting area of research although it is beyond the scope of this paper.

V. Conclusion
The switch to separate taxation of spouses in the UK created an incentive for married couples to
shift investment assets to the spouse with the lower marginal tax rate, typically the wife. By
taking advantage of this form of tax avoidance, households are able to reduce their total tax
burden. Our analysis of the impact of separate taxation on the intra-household allocation of
investment income provides strong evidence that households did indeed take advantage of this
opportunity for tax avoidance through income shifting. In households with an incentive to shift
investment income to the wife, we find an increase in the fraction of wives and a reduction in the
fraction of husbands with investment income. Furthermore, we find an overall increase in the
wives’ share of investment income. For those households in which the incentives are reversed,
we do not find any statistical evidence confirming the income shifting hypothesis although the
small number of these households leads to fairly large standard errors.
We estimate that a 10 percentage point increase in the marginal tax rate differential
between spouses leads to a 2.6-3.1 percentage point increase in the share of investment income
that is shifted to the spouse with the lower marginal tax rate. Our results are robust to a variety

32

of influences that may possibly confound our analysis. However, even though many households
take advantage of the income shifting incentives due to separate taxation, an overwhelming
majority of households do not fully exploit their ability to reduce their tax burden.
