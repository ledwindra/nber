Using a\nlifecycle simulation model, we show that even though deficit policies shift\nsizable tax burdens to future generations, individuals live long enough to make\nthe assumption of an infinite horizon a good approximation for analyzing the\nshort-run savings effects. In practice, periods of debt accumulation such as\nthat in the United States during World War II are reversed sufficiently rapidly\nto make their short-run effects on consumption and national savings relatively\nsmall.\n\n",
