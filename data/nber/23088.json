    "abstract": "\n\nWhile patent systems have been widely used both historically and internationally, there is nonetheless a tremendous amount of controversy over whether patent systems \u2013 in practice \u2013 improve the alignment between private returns and social contributions.  In this paper, I describe three parameters \u2013 how the disclosure function affects research investments, how patent strength affects research investments in new technologies, and how patents on existing technologies affect follow-on innovation \u2013 needed to inform the question of how patents affect research investments, and review the available evidence which has attempted to empirically estimate these parameters.\n\n",
