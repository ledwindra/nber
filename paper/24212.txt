E-cigarettes and Adult Smoking

JEL No. I18
ABSTRACT
Over the past few years, adult use of e-cigs has been increasing while adult smoking has been
declining. Although there is a negative time correlation, it is important to determine if there is a
causal effect of e-cig use on smoking. This is important because of the known health hazards
associated with smoking. A key concern with most prior studies of e-cigs and smoking is that
causality between e-cig use and cigarette use is ignored. One contribution of this paper is to
estimate structural and reduced form equations that replace e-cig use with e-cig price in order to
avoid this endogeneity problem. The data employed to estimate the empirical models come from
the Tobacco Use Supplements (TUS). These data are from the combined July 2014, January
2015 and May 2015 waves of the TUS. The results show that e-cig use increases the probability
of a quit attempt, the probability of a quit failure, the number of quit failures and the probability
of a quit success. It is also estimated that a 10% federal excise tax on e-cigs would reduce the
number of quitters in the US by more than 250,000 per year.

1. Introduction
There are a number of devices on the market today that deliver a dose of nicotine in
vapor form to the user. These devices will be referred to as e-cigarettes (e-cigs) where the ‘e’
stands for electronic. 1 The first e-cigs were disposable and designed to resemble cigarettes.
Today, refillable devices, which do not closely resemble cigarettes, are more common. A
popular current device with the brand name Juul most closely resembles a flash drive. In all ecigs a liquid containing propylene glycol and usually containing nicotine and sometimes
containing added flavorings is vaporized by a battery powered heating element. There is no
research on long-term health issues related to e-cig use, however, e-cigs are currently believed
to be less dangerous than cigarettes because the vapor does not contain the toxins found in the
smoke of a conventional cigarette (Goniewicz; et al. 2013; Czogala et al. 2014). The US
National Institute on Drug Abuse states that because e-cigs deliver nicotine without burning
tobacco, they appear to be a safer, less toxic alternative to conventional cigarettes. 2 The UK
Public Health Department has taken a more definitive view and stated that e-cigs are
significantly less harmful to health than tobacco.
Adult use of e-cigs has increased from 0.3% in 2010 to 3.2% in 2016 while adult
smoking declined from 20.9% in 2005 to 15.1% in 2015. These time series cannot be
interpreted as evidence that the use of e-cigs has causal effects on smoking. However, the
effect of e-cig use on smoking is an important public health question because smoking is known
to be hazardous. Although the public health impact of e-cigs depends on their effect on
smoking, seven states have already passed legislation that requires a tax on e-cigarettes, which
will deter the use of e-cigs. 3

Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. Also, the District of
Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands have a tax.

2. Prior Studies
One group of prior studies finds that e-cigs are associated with reduced smoking. Zhu et
al. (2017) finds that those who report use of e-cigs had a higher smoking cessation rate than
those who report no use of e-cigs. They relied on data from the Tobacco Use Supplements.
Brown et al. (2014) assessed the effectiveness of e-cigs when used to aid smoking cessation in
comparison with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and with unaided quitting. They rely on a
cross-sectional survey of the English population that includes 5863 adults who had smoked
within the previous 12 months and made at least one quit attempt during that period with either
e-cigs, NRT or no aid. They found that e-cig users were more likely to report abstinence than
either those who used NRT or no aid. That is, e-cig users were more likely to have quit smoking
than either the users of NRT or those using no aid. Zhuang et al. (2016) argue that a common
pattern is dual cigarette and e-cig use and that this dual use might delay the cessation of
cigarette smoking. They rely on a nationally representative sample of 2028 US smokers from
2012 and 2014. Long-term e-cig use was defined as using e-cigs at baseline and follow-up.
Use of e-cigs only at baseline or at follow-up was defined as short-term use. Non-users are
defined as those that did not use e-cigs at either survey. Quit attempt rates and cessation rates
were compared across the three groups. At the follow-up, long-term e-cig users had a higher
quit attempt rate and a higher cessation rate than either short-term users or non-users. Among
those making a quit attempt, use of e-cigs as a cessation aid surpassed that of FDA-approved
pharmacotherapy. They conclude that short-term e-cig use was associated with a lower rate of
smoking cessation but that long-term use of e-cigs was associated with a higher rate of smoking
cessation.
Another group of studies finds that e-cigs are not associated with reduced smoking.
Grana, Benowitz, and Glantz (2014) have argued that although e-cig use may reduce smoking it
also may inhibit complete smoking cessation. Kalkhoran and Glantz (2016) provide a review of
papers that attempt to assess the relationship between e-cig use and smoking cessation by
2

adult smokers. The question they are interested in is whether cigarette smokers who report ecig use have a higher or lower probability of quitting smoking. They found 38 studies including
two randomized controlled trials. These studies include Brown et al. (2014) referenced above.
The two randomized controlled trials showed that e-cigs increased the probability of quitting.
However, these studies relied on relatively small samples. Kalkhoran and Glantz (2016)
conclude that these studies as a group predict that the probability of a successful quit is 28%
lower for those who used e-cigs compared with those who did not use e-cigs. That is, e-cig use
is associated with significantly less quitting among smokers.

3. Approach
A key concern with most prior studies of e-cigs and smoking is that endogeneity
between e-cig use and cigarette use is ignored. There could be causality in both directions or
use of both products could be driven by the same underlying unobserved factor. An example of
an underlying unobserved factor is a desire to quit smoking, which is related to the demand for
health. A greater unobserved desire to quit for health reasons could increase e-cigarette use
and increase quits with no causal effect of e-cigs on quitting. Alternatively, an unobserved
demand for nicotine might result in both greater e-cig use and a reduced probability of quitting
smoking. This is seen in the case of smokers who use e-cigs in places where smoking is not
allowed, which reduces the necessity to quit. Either dual causality or underlying unobserved
factors will bias the estimation results. One contribution of this paper is to estimate structural
and reduced form equations in order to avoid this endogeneity problem. The most relevant
outcome is successful quitting but the effect of e-cigs on attempts to quit can provide more
insight into the process. Because attempts can result in either failure or success, we also
estimate the effect of e-cigs on failures to quit. 4

E-cigs could also affect the probability of starting to smoke although this is mainly limited to adolescents.
This project focuses on adults so the question of initiation is not relevant.

3

The empirical model consists of the following three equations. The first is a standard
demand equation for e-cigs:
(1) ECIG = E (e-cig prices, cigarette prices, demographics, fixed effects),
The second equation is a quit function, which has also been used in prior studies.
(2) Quit = Q (ECIG, cigarette prices, demographics, fixed effect).
Because the estimated effect of e-cigs in this quit function is likely to be biased due to
endogeneity between e-cigs and cigarettes, equation (3), which is a reduced form of equations
(1) and (2), is defined with the e-cig variable replaced by determinants of e-cig demand.
(3) Quit = Q (e-cig prices, cigarette prices, demographics, fixed effect).
The estimation of equation (3) eliminates the endogeneity between quitting and e-cig use in
equation (2). Equation (3) is estimated for all attempts, failed quit attempts, the number of
failed quit attempts and successful quit attempts.
One concern with this approach is whether the empirical version of equation (1) can be
interpreted as a demand for e-cigs. E-cig prices are a function of supply and demand. We
expect that in a supply and demand model, if demand was held constant, shifts in supply would
reveal an inverse relationship between price and use. In the empirical models, we use a set of
demographic variables, the price of cigarettes and state and time fixed effects to control
demand. Cigarette prices are included in the e-cig demand function as the price of a potentially
related good. The regressions of equation (1) test the relationship between e-cig price and use
and a negative effect of e-cig prices on e-cig use is expected.

4. The Data
The data employed to estimate the empirical models come from the 2014-2015 Tobacco
Use Supplements (TUS), which are sponsored by the National Cancer Institute and are based
on a subsample of the Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey (CPS). The TUS provide an
extensive set of variables regarding tobacco products for adults ages 18 and over. The TUS
4

began asking questions about e-cig use in 2014 continuing in 2015. The data employed in this
study rely on the combined July 2014, January 2015 and May 2015 waves of the TUS. These
waves of the CPS includes about 450,000 individuals who are eligible for the TUS but only
about 230,000 choose to participate in the TUS. The TUS then limits the survey to those who
respond that they smoked at least 100 cigarettes during their lifetime. This reduced the sample
to about 91,000. The TUS has additional screens on who is asked questions about smoking
and e-cig use. 5 All of the quit related variables are defined for individuals who reported that they
smoked last year. The public use version of the TUS identifies counties with a population of
over 100,000. There are 368 identified counties included in the TUS and these counties
represent about 40% of the US population. For simplicity, we will refer to the counties with over
100,000 individuals as urban and the other counties as rural.
The dependent variables include dichotomous measures of e-cig use, quit attempts,
failed quits and successful quits. A variable measuring the number of failed quits is included in
addition to the dichotomous failed quit variable. This variable includes the value zero for those
who had no quit attempts. Successful attempts are defined as attempts that result in cessation
for 90 days or more.
Both continuous and dichotomous independent variables were also defined. The
continuous variables measure age, family income (divided by 1,000), number of children and
years of education. The dichotomous variables measure Married, Male, Black, and Hispanic
status. The dichotomous variables are equal to one if the individual is in the category defined
by the variable name.
Measures of cigarette prices and e-cig prices were extracted from the Nielsen Retail
Scanner data set. The Nielsen data are derived from supermarkets, drugstores convenience

5

For example, the TUS only asks individuals who said they ever used e-cigs if they now use e-cigs with
individuals who never used e-cigs given a missing value. For the e-cig use variable everyone who was
not asked the question because they had responded earlier that they never used e-cigs and who reported
that they smoked last year were recoded from missing to 0.

stores, liquor stores and mass merchandisers. One concern with the price data is that vape
shops are not included. However, it is probable that vape shop prices are highly correlated with
prices in other nearby stores. Another concern is the percent of e-cigs bought by adults on the
internet. According to the 2014-2015 Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health Survey
only 9.5% of adults buy their e-cigs online. Thus, retail store prices are probably a good
approximation of actual prices paid by adults. E-cigs come in disposable and reusable forms.
Disposable e-cigs provide fixed amount of nicotine and then must be disposed of. Reusable ecigs involve buying a starter kit and then buying replacements. The first e-cigs were disposable
but the reusable form is more common today. The Nielsen Retail Scanner data are limited to 65
large metro areas. Because a number of identified counties had no price data, or very few
reporting stores, average state level prices were used. These state level prices were averaged
at the state and wave level. Thus, the state prices are the average price in the state’s urban
counties only. The regressions are therefore limited to individuals who are identified in the TUS
as living in large counties. So the price variable is a state level variable but reflects only prices
in urban counties, the regressions are limited to individuals in the TUS who live in urban
counties.
Table 1 presents weighted means and standard errors for the primary variables used in
the analysis for those who used e-cigs and those who did not use e-cigs. The purpose of this
table is to examine the descriptive data on differences between e-cig users and non-users in
quit attempts, failures, number of failures, successes and demographics. The data in Table 1
are very similar to the data presented by Zhu et al. (2017) who also used the TUS. Data are
presented first for those who report using e-cigs and second for those who report not using ecigs. The variables quit attempts, failures, number of failures and successes are each defined
as the percent of the full sample, which is everyone who reported smoking last year and lived in
an urban county. For example, for all individuals who reported smoking last year and who lived
in urban counties, about 46% of e-cig users attempted to quit while about 29% of non-e-cig

users attempted to quit. About 36% of the e-cig using sample reported failing and about 10%
reported succeeding. The corresponding values for non-e-cig users are 22% and 7%. Table 1
also shows that adult e-cig users are somewhat older, more likely to be married and less likely
to have minority status than adult non-e-cig users. Table 1 also shows that successful quits as
a percentage of attempts for e-cig users is somewhat smaller than for non-e-cig users. The
values are 21% for e-cig users and 24% for non-e-cig users. The reason that a greater
7

percentage of e-cig users are successful quitters is that there are more attempts by e-cig users
than non-e-cig users.
An important statistical question, which is unclear from the descriptive data, is whether
e-cig users differ in their interest in quitting from non-e-cig users. That is, uncontrolled individual
heterogeneity between the groups may influence the data on attempts, failures and successes
reported in table 1. Two sources of heterogeneity described above are the demand for health
and the demand for nicotine. There are four questions in the TUS that provide some insight on
this issue. These questions are asked only of e-cig users about why they use e-cigs. The
questions are: 1) because they are allowed at times when, or in places where, smoking cigarettes
isn't allowed, 2) because they might be less harmful to me than cigarettes, 3) because they
might be less harmful to people around me than cigarettes and 4) because they help people to
quit smoking cigarettes. Response to the first question, which is about the demand for nicotine,
was 57% positive. Responses to the next three questions, which are about the demand for
health, were 75%, 79% and 78% positive, respectively. Non-e-cig users probably view e-cigs
less favorably. Also, table 1 shows that education and income, which are positively correlated
with the demand for health, are both higher for e-cig users than non-e-cig users. These data
suggest that the use of e-cigs is not random but motivated by the demand for nicotine and the
demand for health. The contribution of this paper is to avoid this endogeneity and test for
causal effects of e-cigs on smoking as described in Section 3.
Table 2 presents weighted means and standard deviations for individuals who reported
smoking last year for urban and for rural counties. The purpose of this table is to examine the
means for these groups because in the empirical work to follow we estimate regressions only for
individuals in urban counties. These data show that the two groups are not significantly different
in e-cig use, quit attempts, failures and successes. However, the urban counties do differ

Price per cigarette, which is equal to $5.76 per pack. 153 unique
observations. R2 is from OLS regressions of each price variable on all the

4-8. All the data are based on the merged TUS-Nielsen sample, which

variation across states and waves in these prices. Cigarette prices vary because of differences
in state excise taxes, transportation costs and retailing costs. E-cigs are only taxed in a few
locations and marketing is typically more at a local level than in the case of cigarettes. E-cig
prices vary across states because of transportation costs, local retailer costs and local
marketing costs. The R-square is from regressions of the price variable on all the fixed effects
used in the regressions presented in tables 4-8. These values show that much of the variations
in price are accounted for by the fixed effects particularly in the case of cigarettes. This
correlation between price and fixed effects can affect the significance levels. The regressions in
10

tables 4-8 present alternative sets of prices, which provide some test for robustness with
respect to choice of price variables. Dropping the fixed effects would create other concerns.
The bottom of table 3 presents the correlations between the price variables. Some of these
correlations are large and could also present problems with significance in the estimation
models. These data problems are due in some measure to the relative newness of e-cigs which
results in a fairly short time dimension in the data.

5. Results
Tables 4-8 present the regression results for e-cig demand and for the quit related
variables. All of the regressions include state and wave fixed effects variables and standard
errors clustered at state level. The tables include alternative combinations of cigarette prices,
starter kit prices, replacement prices and disposable prices. Each table presents the same set
of alternative price specifications. All of the regressions also use the same set of non-price
independent variables and are either logits or ordered logits. All of the regressions are based
on individuals who report that they smoked last year and live in urban counties. The reported
values are coefficients not marginal effects. In addition to coefficients, marginal effects and
elasticities are reported for all significant e-cig price variables. 6
Table 4 presents logit results for e-cig use. In the four regressions presented in table 4
the replacement price is always negative but only significant in one regression. The
replacement price in the other three regressions has relatively low p-values but they are greater
than 0.10. The own price elasticity for e-cig participation based on the second specification and

6 The dependent variables, with one exception are dichotomous. These variables can be interpreted as
rates. The elasticity is the effect of a percentage increase in price on the percentage change in the rate.
For example, if the elasticity were 1, a 10 percent increase in the price would resulted in a 10 percent
decline in the rate and if the rate were .10 it would decline to .09.

the replacement price is estimated at -1.28. This is relatively high compared to own price
elasticity for cigarettes from past studies. The elastic demand suggests that good substitutes
for e-cigs are available. The cigarette price coefficients are positive in the three regressions that

12

include this variable and significant in two of these regressions. The positive coefficient
suggests substitution between e-cigs and cigarettes. Age, Male, Education and minority status
are all negative and significant. We conclude it is likely that the empirical relationship between
e-cig use and e-cig price is negative and that the relationship between cigarette prices and e-cig
use is positive although greater significance levels would have increased our confidence in this
result.
Table 5 presents logit estimates on the effect of e-cig prices on quit attempts. The price
of replacements is negative and significant. That is, e-cig use is positively related to the
probability of a quit attempt. Also, Income and Male are negatively related to quit attempts while
Education, Child and Black are positively related to quit attempts. This is similar to the result for
attempts that is shown in table 1 with descriptive data only. That is, e-cig users make more quit
attempts.
Table 6 presents the logit results for probability of a quit failure and Table 7 presents the
results for the number of quit failures. The regressions for the number of failed quit tries are
order logit regressions because the dependent variable includes four ordered outcomes,
including zero attempts. 7 In all eight regressions, the price of replacements is negative and is
significant in six. There are specific estimates for the marginal effects and for the elasticities for
each outcome of an ordered logit. The values reported are for the outcome 2-3 times. The
results show that e-cig use is positively related to the probability of a quit failure and to the
number of quit failures. As e-cig use goes up the probability of a failed quit goes up and the
number of failed quits goes up because e-cig use increases the number of quit attempts. Most
attempts result in failure but an increase in attempts increases the probability of an ultimate

Estimation was by order logit rather than by a count procedure because the variable has an uneven
metric (never, once, 2-3 times, 4 or more times).

and significant.

Table 8 presents the results for quit successes. The price of replacements is negative
but not significant while the price of starter kits is negative and significant. In the prior
regression, the replacement price was generally significant while the starter kit price was not.
Tests of joint significance show that these two variables are jointly significant at about 5% in the
regressions where they both are included. The regressions show that greater e-cig use
increases the probability of a successful quit. This is consistent with the descriptive data
presented in table 2, which also show that e-cig use increases success. The elasticity for
starter kits was estimated at -1.27 and the elasticity for replacements was estimated at about 1. Age, Black and Hispanic are negatively related to successes while Education is positively
related to successes.
A relevant follow-up question is how an e-cig excise tax would affect the number of
successful quits. As noted above seven states and the District of Columbia have taxes on ecigs. Many other states have also considered a tax on e-cigs. The Food and Drug
Administration has the authority to regulate e-cigs but this has not yet resulted in a federal
excise taxes on e-cigs. 8 The effect of an e-cig excise tax can be estimated with the elasticities
estimated in table 8. We assume a conservation value of -1.0 and assume a federal excise tax,
increases retail prices by 10%. The elasticities imply that this tax would reduce the
successful quit rate by about 10%. The successful quit rate for all smokers is about 7.3% and a
10% reduction would result in a successful quit rate of about 6.6%. About 36 million Americans
smoke and, assuming that 7.3% successful quits each year, about 2.6 million American

smokers quit each year. 9 A 10% increase in the price of e-cigs would reduce the number of
quitters by about 250,000 smokers.

C. Conclusions
The results suggest that there is a positive causal effect of e-cig use on attempts to quit
smoking, on failures to quit smoking and on success in quitting smoking, although greater
significance levels would have made a stronger case. The replacement price was generally the
most important e-cig price. The successful quit rate, given an attempt, is actually slightly
smaller for e-cig users than non-e-cig users. The increase in the probability of a successful quit
is the result of more attempts by e-cig users than by non-e-cig users. According to Chaiton et
al. (2016), it can take six or more failed attempts before a smoker has a success. Thus, for
many smokers a successful quit may only come after a number of failed attempts. The
increased probability of an attempt and the increased number of failed attempts during the past
year suggest that e-cig use helps to create this sequential process that leads to cessation.
Overall, the results present a reasonable case for e-cigs as a useful aid to adults who are trying
to quit smoking.

9

These losses are somewhat offset by the addition of about 800,000 new smokers each year. These
new smokers are young people some of whom may have begun smoking because of e-cig use as an
adolescent.
