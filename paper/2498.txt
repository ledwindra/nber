Introduction

I.

Since the provocative work of Nelson and Plosser (1982), much research
has been devoted to the question of whether, and to what extent, fluctuations

n

real GNP are trend-reverting.

In contrast to what was the prevailing view

only a few years ago, it appears that shocks to real OMP do not dissipate
in five or ten years.

Indeed,

it is hard to reject the view that real GNP is

as persistent as a random walk with drift.
Most of the recent work addressing the persistence question has used
data for the United States.

Yet in post-war United States data, there are

only eight non-overlapping five—year intervals.

One would thus expect that

such data can provide only an imprecise estimate of persistence. The Monte
Carlo experiments reported in Campbell

and Mankiw (1987b) and below in this

paper indeed confirm that it is difficult to estimate persistence with such a
small data set.
One strategy for obtaining more information about persistence is to
expand the data set by using United States data from before the war.

Nelson

and Plosser use data beginning in 1909, and Cochrane (1986) uses data
beginning in 18S9.

The primary problem with such an approach is that the

older data may not be comparable to the newer data.

In Campbell and Mankiw

we report that the persistence properties of the data from 1869 to

1930 are very different from the persistence properties of the data since

A second strategy for obtaining more information on persistence, which
is adopted

by Stulz and Wasserfallen

(1985), Kormendi and McGuire (1987), and

in this paper, is to expand the data Set by using data from other Countries.

It is hard to reconcile the data from most of these countries with

the view that fluctuations in output dissipate in five or ten years.
international data can also shed light on whether, as Lucas (1977)
suggests, "all business cycles are alike."

A stylized fact often noted about

United States post—war quarterly data is that the first autocorrelation of
the growth rate is positive (Blanchard 1981, Kydland and Prescott 1980).
Here we show that this autocorrelation is larger for the United States than
for any other country we study.

in fact,

for France, Germany, and the United

Kingdom, the first autocorrelation of output growth is negative.
Section II of this paper defines more precisely what we mean by the
"persistence" of economic fluctuations, while Section III discusses how these
persistence measures can be estimated nonparametrically. Section IV presents
some Monte Carlo results to shed light on the small sample properties of
these estimators of persistence under different assumptions regarding the
true stochastic process.

Two Concepts of Persistence
What is persistence? For some purposes, a shock to an econo.y say be

considered persistent if it lasts for more than one period. Here, however, we

take persistence as meaning "continuing for a long time into the future," More
formally, suppose that the change in log of GNP is a stationary process with
moving average representation

The impact of the shock on the leve' of GNP

in period t+k is therefore I +

The ultimate

impact

of the

shock on the level of GNP equals the infinite sum of these moving average
coefficients, which is A(1).

The value of 4(1) is the measure of persistence

we proposed in our previous paper (1987a).

For a random walk, 4(1) equals

one for any series stationary around a deterministic

trend,

4(1) equals

zero.

Cochrane (1986) has recently proposed another measure of persistence,
which has also been studied in Campbell and Mankiw (1987a) and Huizinga
(1967).

His measure can be written either as a ratio of variances or as a

function of autocorrelations;

then the variance of the (k+1)-lagged difference is (k+1) times the variance

—4of the once-lagged difference. Hence, for a random walk, the above
expression

is one for all k.

For any stationary series, the variance of

the (k+1)-lagged difference approaches twice the variance of the series, which
is a finite constant.

for large k.

Hence,

for any stationary series,

approaches zero

The limit of the variance ratio is thus a natural measure of

persistence.
The limiting variance ratio, which we call V. is simple and intuitively
appealing. Note that

if a stochastic process reverts to a deterministic time trend,

then one would

expect unusually low growth rates (recessions) to be followed by unusually
high growth rates (recoveries). Thus, at some lags, one would expect
negative autocorrelations. As equation (3) shows, trend reversion is
captured by this measure of persistence, since V incorporates all of these
Sutocorrelations.
The two concepts of persistence are closely related.

For two simple and

important cases -- a stationary process and a random walk --

the

two measures

of persistence A(l) and V produce the same number. More generally, however,
the two measures are not exactly the same.

Then A(i) can be expressed as

Equation (4) shows that the square root of Cochrane's measure of persistence
is

a lower bound on A(1).

The more highly predictable is the differenced

process, the greater is the disparity between the two measures.

III. Estimating Persistence

One can estimate the persistence measure V very simply by replacing the
population autocorrelations in equation (2) with the sample autocorrelations.1
The estimator is

It is also possible to compute nonparametrically an approximate estimate

For the case In which

t

is a random walk with drift, the mean value

is approximately {T-k)/T rather than one (Campbell

of

and Mankiw, 1987b).

Therefore, to correct for this downward bias, we multiply

by 17(1-k).

Although it reduces somewhat the comparability of these results with those in
out previous papers, this bias correction makes the estimates easier to
interpret.

Monte Carlo Results

IV.

This Section presents some Monte Carlo results for the estimators of A(1)
and V discussed above. The Monte Carlo experiment is designed to examine more
precisely the choice of window size (k) and to judge the ability of the
estimates to distinguish between different stochastic processes.

the lowest-order autocorrelations are positive and higher-order

For these last processes the limiting variance

In practice, of course, a further problem arises because we must estimate

To see what effect this has, we run a small Monte Carlo

experiment. For each process, we simulate a sample and then compute the
estimates of persistence. There are 500 replications, and each has 100
observations, which is a typical number of post-war quarterly observations we
use below.

Single Country Results
In this section we examine the persistence properties

of the data from

our seven countries, considered separately. In Table & we present the first
16 autocorrelations of the change in log real output for each of the
countries. The top half of Table 7 reports the persistence estimates

Comparing the first few

autocorrelations with the numbers in Table 2, they appear consistent with
roots of (1.0,0.25), (0.95,0.25), (0.95,0.5) or even (0.9,0.5) for U.S.
output.

Comparing the persistence measures in Table 7 with the Monte Carlo

results in Tables 4 and 5, the same combinations of roots appear to be
consistent with the data.

These results indicate once again how hard it is to

distinguish a process with permanent shocks from one with shocks which die out
slowly.

The results for other Countries are less ambiguous than those for the
United States.

With the exception of the United Kingdom, all the other

countries have persistence measures at k =

than the U.S. measures, and higher than any of the stationary AR(2) processes

higher than

In fact, at k — 60 the

measures for these countries are all

of the processes we simulate, including the highly persistent

processes with a unit root.

These results are not due to very large positive

low—order autocorrelations, since Canada, Italy and Japan have small positive
first autocorrelations, and France and Germany actually have negative first
autocorrelations.

Rather, the persistence of fluctuations in these countries

is due to the absence of many small negative autocorrelations in output
growth.5
The exception to the pattern of persistence is the United Kingdom.

The

first five autocorrelations of British output growth are all negative, and
the persistence measures are less than one.

These results are robust to the

—11—
method used to deseasonalize the British data.

The British results Suggest a

process such as an AR(2) with roots of (0.9,0.25) or (O.95,0}.

Yet the

results are consistent with substantial persistence since our Monte Carlo
study showed very large standard deviations of

for persistent processes.

The U.K. estimates are less than one standard deviation below the mean
estimates for a random walk.6
As a check on the robustness of our results, we also estimated ARMA
models for output growth in each country.

We repeated the procedures of

Campbell and P4ankiw (lYala), omitting the U.S.7

The

results are fully consistent with the nonparametric results on

persistence. In Canada, the likelihood function is rather flat; the Akaike

but all the other estimated models give similar persistence estimates.

much higher likelihood than any lower—order model, and it estimates A(1} at
1.00;

the lower-order models deliver similar persistence estimates.

The ARMA(1,1),

ARMA(2,1) and ARMA(2,2) models have similar likelihoods and similar
persistence estimates.

Finally, in the U.K. the Akaike Criterion picks an

MA(1) model with a persistence estimate of 0.82.

The higher-order models give

lower persistence estimates, and the ARMA(1,2) and ARMA(2,2) models estimate
the impulse response at 80 quarters to be as low as 0.06.
In principle, as Cochrane (1986) has pointed out, it is possible for
low-order ARMA models and nonparametric methods to give very different
persistence estimates.

In practice, we have found that this is not the case.

For every country we study, except the United Kingdom, both nonparametric and

ARMA estimates of persistence exceed unity, while in the U.K. both estimates
of persistence are small.

Cross-Country

Results.

In the previous section, we found considerable persistence in real output
fluctuations for six out of seven countries,

An interesting further question

is whether fluctuations in relative real output (defined as the difference in
log real output between one country and another) are also persistent. It is
entirely possible that they are not, that when one

British output fluctuations are highly transitory and Japanese

—14—

fluctuations are highly persistent.

It is not surprising that these

properties carry over when fluctuations are measured relative to other
countries' output.

A striking new result in Table 9, however, is that Canada,

France, Germany and Italy form a group whose relative output fluctuations are
transitory, even though their absolute output fluctuations are persistent.
The bias-corrected

statistics for relative output within this group never

exceed 0.46, while the equivalent statistics for absolute output are all
larger than 2.13.

Real output in the United States moves more independently;

U.S. fluctuations relative to other countries are
generally about as
persistent as fluctuations in U.S. output itself.
Even though fluctuations in relative real output are quite transitory for
so.e countries, there is no strong evidence that relative real
output is
stationary for any pair of countries. Dickey—Fuller tests with an
autoregressive correction of order 1 through 4 fail to reject the null
hypothesis that relative real output levels for Canada, France, Germanyand
Italy have a unit root.

The tests proposed by Stock and Watson 11987), which

allow arbitrary linear combinations of different countries' outputs to be
stationary, also fail to find evidence that there are any stationary
co.tinations.8

from six other countries.

With the sole exception of the United Kingdom,

output appears more persistent in these other countries.
We find persistence in six Out of seven countries despite the fact that
there are substantial differences across countries in the individual
autocorrelations of output growth.

The first autocorrelation, for example,

ranges from 0.30 in the U.S. to -0.38 in France, while the second ranges
from 0.19 in the U.S. to -0.07 in Germany.

Because of these differences, we

have not tried to pool data from different countries by assuming that they
are generated by a single underlying stochastic process.

We have studied the

behavior of relative output (the difference in log output across countries),
and have found some evidence that relative output levels for Canada, France,
Germany, and ttaly are less persistent than the levels of output of these
countries considered in isolation.
Our results shed some light on different strategies which have been
suggested for estimating persistence.

tests are

biased towards false

rejection when the data are generated by an integrated ARM process with a
large moving average root.

This problem may be affecting the Dickey—Fuller

test for Japanese output growth.

Stockman (1987) also finds that U.K. output is less persistent than that

of other European countries. We note that even for the U.k. there is no clear
evidence that output is stationary around a determistic level.

Dickey—Fuller

tests with autoregressive corrections of order 0 through 4 fail to
reject at
even the lOt level the null hypothesis that the level of U.K. real GDP has a
Unit root.

Detailed

ARM

results for the U.S. are reported in Campbell and Mankiw

{1987a).

This result holds whether we carry Out the tests
using data from all

seven countries, from a group of six excluding Japan, from a
group of five
excluding Japan and the U.K., or from a group of four excluding Japan, .the
and the U.S.

Another approach to estimating persistence-is the use-of unobserved

components models (e.g., Watson,--1g86;Clark, 1987). As discussed-in
Campbell

and Mankiw (1987b).

these models can be viewed as imposing

restrictions on ARMA models.

In this sense, the unobserved components models

Without strong reasons to believe these restrictions

a priori, however, a less strict parameterization appears preferable.
