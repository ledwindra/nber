    "abstract": "\n\nI analyze whether countries with flexible exchange rates are able to pursue an independent monetary policy, as suggested by traditional theory. I use data for three Latin American countries with flexible exchange rates, inflation targeting, and capital mobility \u2013 Chile, Colombia and Mexico \u2013 to investigate the extent to which Federal Reserve actions are translated into local central banks\u2019 policy rates. The results indicate that there is significant \u201cpolicy contagion,\u201d and that these countries tend to \u201cimport\u201d Fed policies. The degree of monetary policy independence is lower than what traditional models suggest.\n\n",
