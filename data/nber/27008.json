    "abstract": "\n\nEven when, objectively speaking, death is on the line, partisan bias still colors beliefs about facts. We show that a higher share of Trump voters in a county is associated with lower perceptions of risk during the COVID-19 pandemic. As Trump voter share rises, individuals search less for information on the virus, and engage in less social distancing behavior, as measured by smartphone location patterns. These patterns persist in the face of state-level mandates to close schools and businesses or to \u201cstay home,\u201d and reverse only when conservative politicians are exposed and the White House releases federal social distancing guidelines.\n\n",
