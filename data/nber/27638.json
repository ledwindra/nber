    "abstract": "\n\nWe show that molecular variation in DNA related to cognition, personality, health, and body shape, predicts an individual\u2019s equity market participation and risk aversion. Moreover, the molecular genetic endowments predict individuals\u2019 return perceptions, most of which we find to be strikingly biased. The genetic endowments also strongly associate with many of the investor characteristics (e.g., trust, sociability, wealth) shown to explain heterogeneity in equity market participation. Our analysis helps elucidate why financial choices are heritable and how genetic endowments can help explain the links between financial choices, risk aversion, beliefs, and other variables known to explain stock market participation.\n\n",
