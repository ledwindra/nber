QUANTIFYING INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL MOBILITY IN TIlE

1980s

ABSTRACT

The Feldstein-Horioka finding, that national saving and investment have been
highly correlated in the past, has not been primarily due to econometric problems
such as endogenous fiscal policy; it has held up equally well when instrumental
variables are used. But the inflow of capital to the United States has been so large
in recent years that an updating of the sample period to 1987 produces a coefficient
on national saving that is lower than in past studies. This decline in the degree of
crowding out of investment can be attributed to the increased degree of financial
market integration in the 1980s. Capital controls and other bathers to the
movement of capital across national borders remained for such countries as the
United Kingdom and Japan as recently as 1979, and France and Italy as recently as
1986. But a new data set of forward exchange rates for 25 countries shows that a
continuing worldwide trend of integration of financial markets in the 1980s had all
but eliminated short-term interest differentials for major industrialized countries by

1988.

It is only the country premium that has been eliminated however, this
means that only covered interest differentials are small. Nominal and real exchange
rate variability remain, and indeed were larger in the 1980s than in the 1970s. The
result is that a currency premium remains, consisting of an exchange risk premium
plus expected real currency depreciation. The popular null hypothesis that expected
real depreciation is constant at zero is tested, and rejected, with a 119-year sample.
(Post-1973 data sets do not allow enough observations to provide a useful test of
this null hypothesis.) The existence of expected real depreciation means that, even
if interest rates are equalized internationally when expressed in a common currency,
large differentials in j interest rates remain. Investors have no incentive to
arbitrage away such differentials. Because there is no force tying the domestic real
interest rate to the world real interest rate, it follows that there is no reason to
expect any country's shortfalls of national saving to be completely financed by
borrowing from abroad.

QIANflIYING ThTERNIiTIC2ThL CAPITAL }K)BflILY IN THE 1980s

Jeffrey A. ,jra]. 1
This paper was written for the National Thireau of Economic
Research conference on Saving, Maui, January 6-7, 1989.

Feldetein and Horioka upset conventional wisdom in 1980

when they concluded that changes in countries' rates of
national savirg bad very large effect on their rates of
investment, arid interpreted this finding as evidence of low
capital mobility. Although their regressions bave been subject

to a great variety, of criticisms, their basic flniin seems to
bold .p. But does it iirly imperfect capital mobility?

Let us begin by king why we would ever expect a
to reduce the
shortfall in one country's national saving
overall availability of funds and thereby crad cut investment
projects that might otherwise be undertaken in that country.
The aggregation together of all forms of "capital" has caused
more than the usual annunt of confusion in the literature on

international capital mobility. Nobody ever claimed that
international flats of foreign direct investment were large

enough that a typical investtient project in the datestic
country would costless]-y be uzxiertaken directly by a foreign

company when there was a shortfall in dcttestic savirq)
Rather, the argument was that the typical Nterican corporation
could borrow at the goirg interest rate in order to finance its

investtant projects and, if the degree of capital biity were
sufficiently high, the goirg interest rate would be tied down
to the world interest rate by international flows of portfolio
capital. If portfolio capital were a perfect substitute for
thysical capital, then the differenoe nild be 3nnaterial; bit

the two types of capital probably are rrit in fact perfect
substitutes.

This paper examines a nwter of alternative ways of
opantifyirg the degree of international capital ntility. One
conclusion is that the barriers to cross-border flows are
sufficiently low that, by 1989, financial markets can be said

to be virtually cailetely intejrat& anor the large
irdustria]. countries (and ancn sane Enaller countries as
well). Bat this is a different prqDosition fran sayir that
real interest rates are equalized across countries, which is
still different fran sayirg that investment projects in a
country are unaffected by a shortfall in national savin. We
will see that there are several crucial links that can, and
probably do, fail to hold.
In many cases, notably the United Kixqlan and Japan (and

perhaps now Italy and France as well) the firdirq of high
2

integration with world finarcial markets is a relatively na'
one, attribitable to liberalization prograns aver the last ten
years. Even in the case of financial markets lit the United
States, integration with the Eurcnarkets appears to have been
incxrplete as recently as 1982 • 2 An important orclusion of

this paper for the United States is that the current accc*int
deficits of the 198 Os have been large eroagh, aM by rn have
lasted lor ena4, to reduce significantly estimates of the
correlation between saving aM invesbrt. This is true even

for time series that go back as far as the 1870s.

The

increased degree of worldwide financial integration since 1979

is identified as one factor that has allowed such large capital

flows to take place over the past decaiD. at even if U.S.
interest rates are now viewed as tied to world interest rates3,
there are still other weak links in the chain. The implication

is that crowdirq out of domestic invesbient can still take
place.

1. Four Alternative fthitions of International jta].
Mobility

By the seooM half of the 1970s, international ecaticeists

had cate to speak of the world financial systan as
characterized by perfect capital mobility. In marty ways, this

was "jtmping the gun." It is true that financial integration
had been greatly enhanced after 1973 by the raicval of capital
3

controls on the part of the United States, Gern'ariy, Canada,

Switzerlard an the Netherlards: by the steady process of
technical aid institutional innovation, particularly in the
Euromarkets: arci by the recycling of OPEC surpluses to
developirq countries, ait a]2rst all developing countries
retained extensive restrictions on international capita]. flows,
as did a majority of irdustrialized countries. Even among the

five major countries without capital controls, capital was not
perfectly mobile by sane definitions.

There are at least four distinct definitions of perfect
capital mobility that are in widespread use. (I) The
Feldstein-Horioka definition:

exogernis changes in national

saving (i.e., in either private savings or government budgets)
can be easily financed by borrowing fran abroad at the going

real interest rate, art thus need not cr1 out investment in
the originating country (except perhaps to the extent that the
country is large in world financial markets). (II)

interest parity: International capital flows ualize real
interest rates across countries. (III) Uncovered interest
parity: Capital flows ualize expected rates of return on
countries' bords, despite exposure to exchange risk. (IV)
Closed interest parity: Capital flows e4ualize interest rates
across countries when contracted in a oanrrn currency. These

four possible definitions are in ascerding order of
specificity. Only the last cordition is an unalloyed criterion
4

for capital irbility in the sense of the degree of financial
market integration across national bairdaries. 4

As we will see each of the first three corditions, if it
is to hold, req.iires an auxiliary asstnrçtion in addition to the
cordition that follows it. Uncovered interest parity requires

not only closed (or covered) interest parity, bit also the
cordition that the exchange risk premium is zero. Real
interest parity requires not only uncovered interest parity,
but also the corxlition that eet&1 real depreciation is zero.
The Feldstein-Horioka cordition requires not only real interest

parity, bit also a certain cordition on the determinants of
investment.

Bat even though the relevance to the degree of

integration of financial markets decreases as auxiliary
corrlitions are added, the relevance to questions regaxdirg the

origin of intertational payments imbalances increases.

We

begin cur consideration of the various criteria of capital
ucbility with the Feldstein-Horioka definition.
2 Feldstein-Horioka Tests

The Feldstein-Horio]ca definition requires that the
country's real interest rate is tied to the rld real interest
rate by criterion (II); it is, after all, the real interest
rate rather than the nominal on tcfl savin ard investment in
theory deperd.

Bat for criterion (I) to hold, it is also

necessary that any an all determinants of a country's rate of
5

invesbnex* other than its real interest rate be uricorrelated
with its rate of national saving. tat the investment rate be
given by
(1)

(I/Y)±=a-br+U,

where I is the level of capital formation, I is national
itput, r is the domestic real interest rate, ani u represents
all other factors, whether quantifiable or not, that detennine
the rate of investment. Feldstein aM Horioka (1980) regressed
the investhent rate against the national saving rate,
(1')

(I/Y)iA+B(NS/Y)i+vi,

where NB is private saving minus the bxlget deficit. To get
the zero coefficient B that they were looking for requires not

only real interest parity:
(2)

(with the rld interest rate r* excqenous or in any other way
uncorrelatsi. with (NSf!) jj, but also a zero correlation between
uj aM (NS/Y)i.

2.1 The Saving-InvestlEnt literature

Feldstein aM Horioka' s firding that the coefficient B is

in fact closer to 1 than to zero has been reproduced many
tires. Most authors have not been willing, ha',ever, to fol1i
them in drawing the inference that financial markets are not
highly integrated. There have been many econometric critiques,

falling into t general categories.
6

Itet anitnly made is the point that national saving is
eniogencus, or In our tens is correlated with uj. This will

be the case if national savin and invesart are both
procyc].ical, as they are in fact Joiam to be, or if they both
respond to the popilatiat or productivity growth rates • 5 it

will also be the case if governnents resrd erogernis1y to
incipient cirrerxt acort IithaJ.ances with policies to diange
piblic (or private) saving in such a way as to red'tre the
imbaj.ancss. This "policy reaction" argument has been made by
FieJ.eke (1982), 'Ithin (1983), Westjtal (1983), Capric aid
Howard (1984), Suimers (1988) and Rciubini. (1988).
Feldstein

Thxt

and Horioka made an effort to handle the econaiietric

erdcgeneity of national saving, nnre so than have sane of their

critics.

To handle the cyclical erdogeneity, they ccztp.ited
avenges over a long enough period of tine that business cycles
could be argued to wash out. To handle other sources of

erdogeneity, they used deicgratic variables as instnunental
variables for the saving rate.
The other econcmetric critiqqe is that if

country

the dcmestic

is large in world finamial markets, r* will not be

and

r=r*,
be correlated with (NS/Y)i. In other

exogercus with resp&t to (NS/Y) j,

therefore even if

r and in turn (1/1)i will
words, a shortfall in danestic savirqs will drive up the world
interest rate, and thus craid out investment in the dcrestic
country as well as abroad. This "large—camtry" arg.nnent has

been made by Murçhy (1984)
7

and Tctin (1983).

An

insufficiently-appreciated point is that the 1arge-irxtxy
argument does not create a prd1 in cross-section sbxlies,
because afl cntrrtries share the sane world interest rate fl.
since r* sfli1y goes into the constant term in a cross-section
regression, it cannot be the source of any correlation with the

rightbard-side variable. The large-countzy problat cannot
explain why the countries that are high-saving: relative to the

average taM to coincide with the camtries that are highinvestirg relative to the average. 6

If the regressions of savirq aid investient rates were a
good test for barriers to finamial market integration, ore
would expect to see the coefficient fallirg over tine. Until
noc, the evidence has if anything: showed the coefficient rising

over ti rather than falling. This firdirg has eriergal both
fran cross-section studies, which typically report pre—ard
post—1973 results — Feldstein (1983), Penati aid Dooley
(1984), aid Dooley, FrarikeJ. aid Itthieson (1987) — aid fran

(.1986) for the United States. The ecornietric eidogeneity of
rational saving does not appear to be the explanation for this

fitting, because it holds &pally well when instrtmental
variables are used.8

The easy explanation for the firdirg is that, enntric
probleis aside, real interest parity — criterion (II) above—

has not held any better in recent years than it did in the
8

past.

of the major industrialized caintries in the 1980s (1980.1—
1985.6) ixned farther frcr real interest parity than they had
been in the 1970s (l973.7—l979.12). In the early 1980s, the

real interest rate in the Unitel States, in particular, rcee
far above the real interest rate of its major tradinj partners,
by any of a variety of nEasures.1° If the domestic real

interest rate is not tied to the foreign real interest rate,
then there is no reason to expect a zero coefficient in the
savirq—investnent regression. We discuss in a later section
the factors urderlyin real interest differentials.
2.2 The U.S. savim-investnsnt regressicqj3ated
Sirce 1980 the massive fiscal experlm't carried ait urder

the Reagan Mministration has been rapidly wderninlxg the
statistical firñirg of a high savirq—investnent correlation for
the case of the United States. The increase in the structural
budget deficit, which was neither accxntdatal by ncxnetary
policy nor finarted by an increase in private savirq, reduced
the national savin rate by 3 per cent of QIP, relative to the
1970s. The investment rate — which at first, like the savirq

rate,

by 1988

had

approximately reattained ità 1980 level at best.

The saving

shortfall. was made up, necessarily, by a flood of borrcwirq
frt abroad equal to more than three per cent of Q1P. Hence

the current acxxirit deficit of $161 billion in 1987.

(By

contrast, the U.S. current aoccunt balance was on average equal

to zero in the 19705.)

By rat, the divergence between U.S. national saving aid
investnent has been sufficiently large aM long-lasting to sbai

up in longer-ten regressions of the Feldstein-Horioka type.

at of differentials in expected rates of return

The differential in expected rates of return on two
countries • bards is the uncovered interest differential, the
mninal interest differential minus the expected charqe in the
13

extharqe rate:

i — i* — (e, depr). If asset denards

are hi'1y sensitive to eqsta rates of return, then the
differential will be zero, which gives us urcoverel interest
parity:

i—i*— (expdepr) =0.
To distirquish this parity ctnlition, which is Criterion (III)

that apparent deviations fran PPP might be attrlhited to

The ,tivation for lookirg at PPP in this section has been

to obtain insight into the expected rate of real depreciation,

because that is the variable that can give rise to real
interest differentials even in the presence of uzwvered
interest parity. In rejectirq the rardan walk desa'ipti*t of

Because there are so many ocxupetirg definitiais of the
21

degree of international capital ncbility, it would be worth
?aciowin if the sort of countries that register high by ons
criterion are also the sort that register high by the others.
In this section we look at rates of return in the l9SOs across
a sample of 25 countries. We begin with the broadest iteasure

of barriers to international capital ntbility, the differential
in real interest rates, defined as:
r—r*= (i-'expinfl) — (i*—expinfl*).
(4)

Subsequently we will decoiqpose the real interest
differential into a cononent due to "political" or country
factors arid a caçonent due to currency factors:
(5)

r_r*=(i_i*_fd)+(fd_expinfl+expiflfl*),

when i is the domestic nominal interest rate, i* is the
foreign nominal interest rate,

and

fd is the forward discount

on the datestic currency. The first tenu (i - i* - fd) is the

covered interest differential. We call it the political or
cxtntry premium because it captures all barriers to integration
of financial markets across national bctniaries: transactions

costs, information costs, capital controls, tax laws that
discriminate by country of residence, default risk, and risk of
future capital controls. The second term could be described as

the real forward discount.

We call it the currency premium

because it captures differences in assets according to the
currency In which they are denominated, rather Uan In terms of

the political jurisdiction In which they are issued. As we
will see, the currency premium can in turn be deccriposed Into

The covered interest differential for France is nnflt

larger aid tinre variable than that for the other major
irdustrializal countries knan to be free of capital controls.
This is the reverse of the finlin fran the criterion of real
interest differentials in Table 5. It supports the value of
the criterion of covered interest differentials as the prcper
test of financial market interatic.ti. The differential, with

its neqative sign signifying rtrols on French capital
aitflQs, has been previously studied, especially its terilercy
to shoot up shortly before devaluations of the franc.31
data indicate that the last major ocairrerce of this çberaint
was February 1986; since then the differential has been close
to zero.
similarly, the sane phenomenon for Italy, which has also

been previously studied (e.g., Giavazzi aid Pagano, 1985),
appears to have enial after the February 1986 realigreent.
France aid Italy have apparently been dismantlirq their capital
contxols qpickly ein4i to neet a 1990 aaaill Ire for

liberalization recently set by the EEC Twelve.32

Of four

cairrtries that are expected to require a later dad1 iris, Spain

aid Porttqal have by our measures already been liberalizing

[plots sln'z that the magnitude of the covered interest
differential fell shaiply in 1987 for these two countries], bit
Greece and IreJ.aM have not. Sweden is one ic-EEC European
29

cazttry that appears to have rial tauaid liberalization
durfrg air sarple period, while Norway does not. AU of these
European aazntries show up with reative maan differentials,

whith inplies that the rainixq controls act to discourage
capital aitflow rather than inflow. For the C cxxintries,
this firxlirg supports records of the European Canmission, which

report ncre fran for short—term inflows than short-term
outflows.

Germany. Malaysia's differential has been considerably higher,

particularly in 1986, but still catpares favorably with sate
European countries.

Not surprisingly, our reniainirg LDCS [Mexico, Gr,
Portugal, Bahrain arc! Saith Africa] show by far the largest arc!

itst variable covered interest differentials.34

Again, the
results are precisely what one n1ld expect if covered interest

differentials are the proper criterion for capital rbility,

hit the reverse of what the saving-investment criterion shows.
Why does the covered differential criterion give such
different answers fran the savirg-thvesbnent criterion, which
shows a high degree of saving-retention ancrq irdustrialized
30

Feldstein aM Horioka (1980, p.315) argus

financial markets

that

longer-term

at

maturities, as ccnrtparal to the three-ixinth maturities used in
tests of covered interest parity such as those reported above:

It is clear frau the yields at short-ten s&tirities in
the Euroairrency market aid the forward prices of those

curreities that liquid financial capital rves very

rapidly to arbitrage such short-term
differentials. . . .There are haQever reasons to be
sceptical about the extent of such long-ten arbitrage.

Studies of international Interest parity have been
restricted by a lack of forward exctharqe rates at horizons
going exit nuch further than one year.35 kit even without the

use of forward rate data, there are ways of getting araird the
problem of exchange risk. tata on cirrercy swap rates can be
used in place of forward exchange rates to test the long—term
version of Interest rate parity. Pcwer (1987) firds that the

The magnit4s of these laq-term differentials cntçare
favorably with the magnitude of the short-ten differentials.
The implication is that Feldstein and Horioka are wrrg in

their conjture that there is a ten-stricture weeqe
separatir national capital nkats.36 me nrist relevant
distirction appears to be, not lorg-term vs. short-term, hit
rather real vs. rntlnal.
4.3 "Peal forward discounts:" The anremv vraniuxn

Even for those countries that ethibit no substantial
country premium, as reflect& in covered interest parity [fd(i - i*) = 0], there nay still be a substantial ourrercy

prEniuzn that drives real interest differentials [(i - exp inf 1)
- (i* - exp irtfl*)] away fran zero. If real interest
differentials axe not arbitraged to zero, then there is in turn
no reason to eçect savirq—investnent correlations to be zero.

Table 7 reports the statistics for the airrercy prsthn,
as measured by the "real forward discount:"

fd -

(exp

infl - exp infl*).

Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Austria and Japan, for

example, all have substantial real forward discounts (or—
ucre precisely — real forward premia), which constitute
32

approximately the entirety of their real interest
differentials. These are ns*ries with currencies that have

exrietd a 1t of exchange rate variability, both 'uninal
az real, vis-a-vis the dollar slice 1973, alt especially since
1980.
As a consequence, sate canbination of exchange risk
premiuns ard expectal real depreciation — factors pertainir4

to the currency, not to the political jurisdiction — produces

the gap in real interest rates.

For these five financially
open iniustrializ&1. octmtries, ard for Borg Thn as well, the

currency factors produce a negative real interest
differential, while the covered interest differential (tha.4i

small) is pceitive: the ttal1 regulations or frictias that
renain in these caintries are, if anything, working to resist

capital inflow (at least at the short eM of the maturity
spectnmt), not aitflaz as one waild mistakenly carlude fran
the real interest differential criterion. The other countries
all have highly variable currency premiums as well • IMeed the

real_al forward discount (currency preniint) is iitre variable than

the covered interest differential (cc*mtxy premium) for all bit

three of air 25 cazitries (Greece, Mexico, aM Frame). The
last rows of Tables 6 aM 7 show that the average variability
across all caintries is higher for the currency premium than
for the octintry premium.

Table 7a projects the real forward discount on the s
three variables as in Table Ba to get an ex ante measure. Its

stardarfi deviation iz shows six ca.intries for what the
33

crrezxy preini'tnt is less variable than the ccxwrtry pre3ni
(Greece, Mexico, Portual, Ftarca, Italy aid Spain). 3± the
oarrery preiniini reiains the major obstacle to real. interest

parity for ret countries.
4.4 Further decarositiOn into excbarcte risk preniin aid

e3cDectaI real deeciati

our deccattpositiat so far has 1inip two tens, the
excharie risk premium aid expect& real depreciation, together
into the currerty premium:

fd -

exp

Intl. + exp infl* = (fd

-

exp

depr) + (e)q) depr-

exp intl + exp infl*).
In this section we attempt to ccxplete the decanpositict k&

separatirg these two tens. TO do so requires a sure or
ncdel of expected depreciation. The us'iial aporoach is to use
the a post charges In the spot rate (depr) as a measure of ex

ante expectations (eq depr), aid to argue that urder rational

expectations the eçectational error (e depr - exp depr)
shaild be rardan (urorrelated with intonation currently

available at tl t).
Column (1) of Table 8 reports the iiean value of (fddepr) for each of am countries. )tst of the means are
positive, showini that the weak-dollar period (1985-88)
dominates over the strorg-dollar period (1982—1985). [The five

exceptions, currercies that depreciat against the dollar at a
34

rate ncre rapid than predict by the forward discount, v.re
the Hag Hag dollar, DJ.aysian rirwit, sirgapore dollar,
Saudi Arabian riyal, ard Saith African r&d.] Sit only three
currencies have n risk preniims, of either sign, that are
statisticafly significant [the Saixii Arabian riya.1., ard two
that awreciated strorqly against the dollar, relative to the
forward rate: the Japarse yen ard the Portuguese esct.do].

Furtherre, in a majority of cases [16/25], the sign of the

nean return differential is the rcsite of the sign of the
tan real interest differential during the sass period (Table
5, column 1).

So this uasure of the exchange risk premium

does not explain any positive part of the real interest
differential.
The neasures of variability of (fd - depr) show up very
large in altmins (2), (3) aid (4). These are neasures of the
variability of ex post return differentials, not ex ante. They

tell us little abazt the variability of the exoharge risk
premium. Sit the high variability of the exztharge rate does
tell us two things. First, it provides an thvious explanation
— low power — why the first nntnts might not be

statistically significant. On the other hard, the existerce of

substantial wcertainty regardirg the futhre spot rate
suggests, via the theory of optimal portfolio diversification,
that a non-zero exchange risk premium nist exist, to reward
risk-averse investors for holding currencies that are perceivs
as risky or that are In oversupply.
35

To estimate the ex ante excbarge risk preniwn, in Table

Ba

we project (fd - depr) onto air s three variables: the
forward discount, interest differentia]. axt inflation
di.fferent.ia1.. The rsressiai is statisticafly siüficant for
a majority of currencies, as many others have fccrd.37

The

stan3ard deviation shais the ntst variable eietharge risk
prEd.uns belorg to Mexico aid New Zealard, bit the United

Kflan,

Netherlards, Austria, Germany aid Switzerlard follow

close behird.

In Table 9 we report the statistics for the other
ccrçonent of the currency premium, expected real depreciation.

As natal earlier, given the widely-accepted failure of
purthasirq power parity on levels, there is na theoretical
reason to expect it necessarily to bold in tens of expected
rates of thaxwe, the hypothesis scuietlsiss )an&n as ex ante

relative purdhasirg power parity. Table 9 reports the
statistics for ex post real depreciation. The neans in colnt
(1) are negative, irdicatirq real açreciaticn of the currency
against the dollar, for all European countries aid for ncst
others as well. The only five eceptions, countries that

experieit real depreciation against the dollar, were our
three East Asian developing countries, Australia, aid Babrain.

This last was the only one, of either sign, that was
statistically significant.
We already kxi, frau the results reported above for the
36

119 years of U.S.-U.K. data, that we canrct expect to reject a

To estimate a ante expected real depreciation, in Table

9a we project a post real depreciation, again, on the sane
three conten!poraneals variables. The staMard deviations for
the varicis currencies are qpite similar to those reported in
Table Sa for the projected exchange risk prnium. (It seaM

5. Conclusion
We can ann up with four conclusions.

(1) Capital controls ard other barriers to the ncveisnt of
capita]. across national borders remained for such countries as

the United ICinjdnn aM Japan as recently as 1979, aM flai
aM Italy as recently as 1986. &± a contiraiing worldwide
trerd of intsration of financial itarkets in the 1980s had all
but eliminated interest differentials for major irdustrialized
coi.ntrjes by 1988.

(2) Only the country preuii.nn has been eliminated; this neaz
that only covered interest differentials are snail.
Real aid nominal exthane rate variability remain, aid irdeed

were larger in the 1980s than in the 197Os, The result is
that a crresv prenitin remains, consjstir of an exchange risk
premitnn plus expected real currency depreciation. This nEans

that, even with the alization of covered interest rates,
large differentials in

interest rates remain.

(3) The United States in the l980s began to borni on such a
38

massive sate internationally that the traditional "FeldsteinHorioka" firxiin of a near-unit correlation between national
savirq aId invesbnent has broken dn. The process of
liberalization in Japan aid other major caintries was prcbably
one factor behird this massive flai of capital to the United
States.
(4) In

addition to the gape that distinguish covered interest

parity fran real interest parity, there is a further gap that

separates real interest parity fran the proposition that
changes in national saving do not crowd at Investment because
they are raa&13 y financed by borrowini fran abroad. Bads are

not perfect substitutes for &juities, aid euities are not
perfect substitutes for plant aid eguiprt. Thus at eadi
stage, there are good reasons to think that shortfalls in
national saving continue to be capable of cras'dln ait
investment, even if to a smaller extent than before 1980.

Glick (1987) examines real interest differentials for six
Pacific Basin countries vis—a-vis the United States.

10. The 10-year real Interest differential via-a-vie a weighted
average of 0—5 countries was abaxt 3 par cent in 1984, whether

expected inflation is measured by a distrihited lag, by 050
forecasts, or by IIU forecasts • In 1980, by rtrast, the
differential was about —2 per cent. Frankel (1986, pp. 35—36).

11. Gross investhient was 16.0 per cent of G1P in 1980, whith
was itself considered a low ntnter (dam 0 •5 % fran 1971—80].

12. The instnmental variables used are the dependency ratio

determinant of private saving, and military experditure as a

saving—investhent coefficient in the l980s, for a cross-section
of industrialized cxxintries (tha4 they do not use
instnmerrta]. variables, aid are thus liable to the eccnanet.ric
criticisns that others have raised concerning the endogeneity
of national saving).
16. Measuring barriers to integration by differences in rates
of return has the problem that a given degree of integration
can appear snaller or larger depexxlixq on the disturbances to

saving (or to other variables) airing the sample period in
question. For example, the greater degree of variability in
the U.S. real interest differential in the 19805, as canpared
to the 19705 or 1960s, could be attrtited to the greater
swings in variables such as the structural budget deficit,
rather than to a later degree of capital nrbility. [In any

case, the degree of variability in cctered interest
differentials is very low in the 1980s, as we will see belai.]
All we can say for sure is that if the barriers to integration

are essentially zerO (the degree of capital ixthiity is
essentially perfect), then differentials in rates of return

should be essentially zero.
17. For example, Knqnan fani that the staniard deviation for

the real mark/dollar exchange rate during the German

hyperinf].ation, February 192 0—December 1923, was mudi larger

(20.8 percent) than during the l970s, even tha4i the serial
correlation was hi'ier (.765).

APPENDIX

U.S. Saving and Investment
Data Sources

A. 1929 to 1987 Regressions
1. Savings and Investment
Gross saving is from line ¶ of table 5.1 of the The National Income and
Product Accounts of the United States. 1S29-1 982 (Njf) while gross
private domestic investment is line 16 of the same table. For the years
1983 to 1987 (preliminary), savings and investment are found in table 8-28
of the 1988 edition of the Economic Report of the President Both series
are divided by GNP, line 1 of table 1.1 in the NIPA and table B-i of the
Economic Report of the President All three series are in nominal terms.
2. Instrument 1: The Dependency Ratio
The dependency ratio is defined here as the sum of those older than 64 and
younger than 21 divided by those in the range 21 to 64 years old. Between
1929 and 1969. these data are taken from Series P29, A37, and A41 of
Historical Statistics of the United States. Colonial Tinies to 1970 (herafter
HSUS). For 1970 to 1987. the data are from various issues of the
Statistical Abstract of the United States, in a table titled "Total Population,
by Age and Sex."
3. Instrument 2: Defense Spending
Defense spending is provided in Series V4FB, Y459, and Y460 of the HSUS
for 1929-1970. Before 1954 defense spending is defined as the sum of
spending by the Departments of the Army, Navy, and (after 1949) Air
Force. After 1954 these departments are lumped as the Department of
Defense. For 1971 to the estimated 1987 expenditures, the data come from
the Statistical Abstract. In the regressions, defense spending is used as a
percent of GNP, collected as above,
4. Cyclical Adjustments
Savings and investment (as a percent of GNP) are cyclically adjusted by
regressing each against the percent gap between actual GNP and trend GNP.
The residuals from these regressions are the cyclically adjusted variables.
Trend GNP is estimated for the period 1955 to 1980 by the Holloway in The
Survey of Current Business, March, 1986, in "The Cyclically Adjusted
Federal Budget and Federal Debt: Revised and Updated Estimates." 1981

through 1987 data are from various issues of Iht$urvev of Current
Business, in the "Reconciliation and Other Tables section.

B. 1869 to 1987 Regressions
1. All Variables, 1 929 to 1 987
All the series for these more recent years is collected as described above in

section A. The series are then averaged over ten year periods, beginning
with 1929-1936. Since no data are available for 1988, the final observation
is an average over nine years, 1979-1g87.

57

2. Savings and Investrnen'
Roger Ransom and Richard Sutch provide estimates of gross private saving
and productive capita! formation in table 4 of their paper t)omestlc Saving
as an Active Constraint on Capital formation In the American Economy,
1839-1928: A Provisional Theory? These data are given in terms of
percent of augmented GNP? Column 1. gross private domestic capital
formation, corresponds with the gross private domestic investment used for
later years. Column 5, gross private saving, is not directly comparable with
gross saving in the current National Income and Product Accounts because
consumer durables and public land sales are included. Thus, these two
items, In columns 2 and 3, are subtracted from gross private saving to yield
comparable gross saving as a percent of GNP.
3. Gross National Product
Augmented GNP was not directly available in any of the tables I had from
Ransom and Sutch. However, many of the savings and investment
aggregates are given in dollar levels in table E-1 of Working Paper Number
2 of the same series. GNP is calculated here as gross private saving
(column 8 of table E-1) divided by gross private savings as a percent of
GNP (column 5 of table 4) and multiplying by 100. Since percentages are
given with 2 decimal points (xx.xx), errors introduced by this method should
be negligible.
4. Instrument 1: Dependency Ratio
Between 1900 and 1928 the data are collected as detailed above in A.2.
Before 1900, the data are from Series A119-125 and A133 of the
There are two problems with these series. First, only the years 1870. 1880,
1890, and 1900 are available. For this work intervening years were
interpolated assuming a constant growth rate for population in each age
group. Age groups are 0-5, 5-9, 10-14, 15-19, 20-24, and over 65. 1869
numbers were constructed assuming the same growth rates implied by the
1870 and 1880 data. The second problem is that the group 20-24 does not
allow separation of those under and over 21, the dividing line between
dependency and working age in the dependency ratio. Here it is assumed
that 20 percent of the 20-24 age group is age 20.
5. Instrument 2: Defense Spending
Defense spending is calculated as above in A.3. To produce defense
spending as a percent of GNP, the ten year average dollar value is divided
by the implied GNP from Ransom and Sutch.
C. Comparison to 1985 Data
1. Definition of National Savings and Investment
In the earlier study I erroneously included consumption of durable goods
and public land sales in national savings and investment. This is tine in
theory, but the 1929-87 data do not include either of these items. Thus,

aving Working Paper Series, Number 1, Institute of Business and
Economic Research, University of California, Berkeley.

savings and investment as a percent of GNP were much higher during the
early decades, as compared to the post depression levels. Using corrected
data, it is still true that post-war levels of savings and investment are
lower than pre-depression.
2. The Dependency Ratio
The current definition of the demographic instrument for private saving is
the dependency ratio (see A.2). In 1985 the ratio used was those over 65
divided by those over 20. Since demographers are familiar with the new
measure, and since it is more clearly consumers in the numerator and
savers in the denominator (with life-cycle consumption theory), the new
measure should be superior. In practice, the dependency ratio varies a
good deal over the long sample, while the earlier measure is little more
than a trend line.
