    "abstract": "\n\nChild poverty fell to historic lows in 2021, in large part due to the temporary expansion of the Child Tax Credit (CTC). We consider the possible implications of this expansion on children\u2019s short- and long-term development. To do so, we review the available short-run evidence from the 2021 expansion and the existing research evidence on the longer run effects of similar income transfers in childhood on child health and human capital. We conclude that the CTC likely improved child health and well-being in the short and long run, with greater impacts for poor children and modest or nonexistent effects for non-poor children. Moreover, the effects might be more substantial for younger children and for those in places with weaker safety nets.\n\n",
