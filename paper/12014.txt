ABSTRACT
We use a fully-specified neoclassical model augmented with costly external equity as a laboratory
to study the relations between stock returns and equity financing decisions. Simulations show that
the model can simultaneously and in many cases quantitatively reproduce: procyclical equity
issuance; the negative relation between aggregate equity share and future stock market returns; longterm underperformance following equity issuance and the positive relation of its magnitude with the
volume of issuance; the mean-reverting behavior in the operating performance of issuing firms; and
the positive long-term stock price drift of firms distributing cash and its positive relation with bookto-market. We conclude that systematic mispricing seems unnecessary to generate the return-related
evidence often interpreted as behavioral underreaction to market timing.

Introduction

We study the dynamic, quantitative relations between stock returns and equity financing
decisions using a fully-specified neoclassical model augmented with costly external equity.
The issue is important. Recent literature in empirical corporate finance has uncovered
an array of evidence often interpreted as substantiating a window-of-opportunity theory of
financing decisions in response to systematic mispricing in equity markets. In particular, Ritter (2003) argues that managers can create value for existing shareholders by timing financing
decisions to take advantage of time-varying relative costs of debt and equity caused by market
inefficiencies. Managers can issue equity when their stock prices are high and turn to internal
funds or debt when stock prices are low. As supporting evidence, Ritter cites many empirical
studies that document long-run abnormal returns following corporate financing events.
Using simulations, we demonstrate that our neoclassical model can reproduce simultaneously, and in many cases quantitatively, many stylized facts often interpreted as behavioral
market timing. These facts include: (i) the amount and frequency of equity issuance are procyclical (e.g., Choe, Masulis, and Nanda (1993)); (ii) the new equity share in total amount of
new equity and debt financing is a significantly negative predictor of aggregate stock market
returns (e.g., Baker and Wurgler (2000)); (iii) firms conducting seasoned equity offerings
underperform nonissuing firms with similar size and book-to-market in the long run, and the
magnitude of this underperformance increases with the volume of issuance (e.g., Loughran
and Ritter (1995), and Spiess and Afflect-Graves (1995)); (iv) the operating performance of
issuing firms exhibits substantial improvements prior to the equity offerings, but then deteriorates, and issuing firms are also disproportionately high-investing, high-growth firms (e.g.,
Loughran and Ritter (1997)); (v) there exists a positive long-term stock price drift for firms

distributing cash back to shareholders, and the magnitude of the drift is stronger among
value firms (e.g., Lakonishok and Vermaelen (1990), Ikenberry, Lakonishok, and Vermaelen
(1995), and Michaely, Thaler, and Womack (1995)); and finally (vi) capital investment is
negatively associated with future stock returns in the cross section, and the magnitude of
this association is stronger among firms with higher cash flows (e.g., Titman, Wei, and Xie
(2004), Anderson and Garcia-Feijóo (2005), Polk and Sapienza (2005), and Xing (2005)).
We deliberately do not include any behavioral bias in our model, in which firms choose
investment and financing decisions optimally in response to aggregate and firm-specific
productivity shocks. Firm-specific shocks affect corporate decisions through operating cash
flows. And aggregate shocks affect corporate decisions through both operating cash flows
and an exogenously-specified stochastic discount factor that admits a countercyclical price of
risk, as in Berk, Green, and Naik (1999). Our simulations suggest that systematic mispricing
seems unnecessary to generate the evidence often interpreted as behavioral underreaction to
market timing, or more generally, the window-of-opportunity theory of financing decisions.
However, investor sentiment, for example, as modeled by Barberis, Huang, and Santos (2001),
can potentially affect the countercyclical price of risk exogenously specified in our model.
We therefore do not suggest that the timing-related evidence is fully rational, but we do
argue that investor sentiment seems unnecessary.
The intuition driving our results is simple. Controlling for expected productivity, the
investment-to-asset ratio correlates negatively with expected returns: all else equal, firms
with lower costs of capital invest more. And the balance-sheet constraint equating the sources
of funds with the uses of funds implies that equity issuing firms are disproportionally high
investment-to-asset firms and cash-distributing firms are disproportionally low investmentto-asset firms. The negative investment-return relation then implies that equity issuance
2

should correlate negatively with expected returns, and that cash distribution (dividend or
share repurchase) should correlate positively with expected returns. Moreover, because expected productivity is procyclical, capital investment is also procyclical, a common prediction
across neoclassical models (e.g., Kydland and Prescott (1982)) and a fact well-documented
in the business cycle literature (e.g., King and Rebelo (1999)). The balance-sheet constraint
then implies that new equity share must be procyclical and predict stock market returns
with a negative sign, given that the aggregate expected return is countercyclical.
Firm-level profitability is mean-reverting in the model as well as in the data (e.g., Fama
and French (1995, 2000)). Ex-post, equity issuers tend to be firms that have experienced big,
positive firm-specific profitability shocks in the recent past. But going forward, issuers face
the same conditional distribution of shocks as other firms do. When looking back at the historical data, econometricians are likely to observe that the operating performance of issuing
firms displays substantial improvements before the issuance but deteriorates afterwards.
Our work is related to several recent papers. Carlson, Fisher, and Giammarino (2004b)
construct a real options model and argue that prior to equity issuance, a firm has an option
to expand along with some assets in place. This composition is levered and risky. If the
exercise of the option is financed by equity, risk must drop. This mechanism can potentially
generate the long-term underperformance following equity issuance. We complement their
work mainly by analyzing the negative long-term drift following equity issuance and the
positive long-term drift following cash distribution simultaneously in a unified framework.
Carlson et al. leave the cash-distribution side largely open. Moreover, by modeling business
cycles explicitly, we also reproduce the procyclical equity issuance waves and the negative
predictive relation between the new equity share and stock market returns.
In the context of initial public offerings, Pástor and Veronesi (2005) develop a model of
3

optimal timing in which waves of initial offerings are driven by declines in expected market
returns, increases in expected aggregate profitability, or increases in prior uncertainty about
the average future profitability of new firms. Our investment-driven mechanisms complement
their insights because we study the powerful role of capital investment in the context of
raising and distributing capital by publicly traded firms and its impact on the cross section
of expected returns. Further, different from the Pástor and Veronesi (2003, 2005) valuation
framework in the style of Ohlson (1995), our model is rooted in neoclassical economics in
the style of Cochrane (1991).
We also extend Zhang (2005a) by solving explicitly a fully-specified neoclassical model.
Doing this allows us to use computational experiments to evaluate quantitatively to what extent our economic mechanisms can reproduce the timing-related evidence. While the match
of model moments to data moments is by no means perfect, our simulations demonstrate that
these mechanisms are at least quantitatively relevant, if not important. In contrast, Zhang’s
analysis is largely qualitative, although the scope of his analysis is broader. Our simulations
also yield several additional insights including, among others, the procyclical equity issuance,
the predictive relation between the new equity share and stock market returns, the positive
relation between the volume of issuance and the magnitude of the underperformance, and
the mean-reverting operating performance of issuing firms.
The rest is organized as follows. We construct the dynamic model in Section 2. Section 3
calibrates and solves the model. Section 4 simulates the model and presents the quantitative
results. Section 5 briefly discusses related literature. Finally, Section 6 concludes.

2

The Model

We construct a fully-specified neoclassical model, similar to that used in Zhang (2005b),
augmented with costly equity financing.

While Zhang studies the value premium, we

study financing-related anomalies. It is reassuring, to us at least, that models with similar
microeconomic foundations can be used to confront different anomalies, even though these
anomalies are often treated in different strands of the empirical finance literature.
We start by describing the technology and stochastic discount factor in the economy. We
then delineate how firms maximize their market value by making their investment, financing,
and payout decisions. Finally, we discuss how risk and expected returns are determined
endogenously in connection with these corporate policies.

Technology Production requires one input, capital, kt , and is subject to both an aggregate
productivity shock and an idiosyncratic productivity shock. The aggregate shock, x t , has a
stationary and monotone Markov transition function, Qx (xt+1 |xt ), and is given by:
xt+1 = x (1 − ρx ) + ρx xt + σ x εxt+1 ,

(1)

where εxt+1 is an i.i.d. standard normal variable. The aggregate shock is the unique source of
systematic risk; otherwise all firms will have expected returns equal to the real interest rate.
In the model, the firm-specific shock is the unique source of firm heterogeneity. The firmspecific shock, zjt , is uncorrelated across firms, indexed by j, and have a common stationary
and monotone Markov transition function, Qz (zjt+1 |zjt ), given by:
zjt+1 = ρz zjt + σ z εzjt+1 ,

(2)

where εzjt+1 is an i.i.d. standard normal variable. εzjt+1 and εzit+1 are uncorrelated for any
5

pair (i, j) with i 6= j. Moreover, εxt+1 is independent of εzjt+1 for all j.
And the production function is given by:
α
yjt = ext +zjt kjt
,

(3)

where yjt and kjt are the operating profits and capital stock of firm j at time t, respectively.
Further, 0 < α < 1, so the production displays decreasing return to scale.

Stochastic Discount Factor Following Berk, Green, and Naik (1999), we specify
exogenously the stochastic discount factor without solving the consumer’s problem. This
research strategy seems reasonable because we aim to link expected returns to firm
characteristics through value-maximizing corporate policies.
Let mt+1 denote the stochastic discount factor from time t to t+1. We specify
log mt+1 = log η + γ t (xt − xt+1 )

(4)

γ t = γ 0 + γ 1 (xt − x)

(5)

where 1 > η > 0, γ 0 > 0, and γ 1 < 0 are constant parameters. Equation (4) is in essence
a reduced-form representation of the intertemporal rate of substitution for a fictitious
representative consumer. To capture the time-varying price of risk, equation (5) assumes
that γ t decreases in the demeaned aggregate productivity, xt −x̄. We remain agnostic about
the economic forces driving the time-varying price of risk. Potential sources include, among
others, countercyclical risk aversion (e.g., Campbell and Cochrane (1999)), countercyclical
amount of economic uncertainty (e.g., Bansal and Yaron (2004)), and loss aversion (e.g.,
Barberis, Huang, and Santos (2001)).

6

Corporate Policies Upon observing the current aggregate and firm-specific productivity
levels, firm j chooses optimal investment, ijt , to maximize its market value. The capital
accumulation follows:
kjt+1 = ijt + (1 − δ)kjt

(6)

where δ denotes the depreciation rate, which is constant across time and across firms.
Capital investment entails quadratic adjustment costs, denoted cjt :
a
cjt ≡ c(ijt , kjt ) =
2



ijt
kjt

2

kjt

where a > 0

(7)

The adjustment-cost function satisfies that ∂c/∂i > 0, ∂ 2 c/∂i2 > 0, and ∂c/∂k < 0. In other
words, both the total and the marginal costs increase with the level of investment. The total
adjustment cost also decreases with capital, displaying economy of scale.
When the sum of investment, ijt , and adjustment cost, cjt , exceeds internal funds, yjt ,
the firm raises new equity capital, ejt , from the external equity markets:
ejt ≡ max {0, ijt + cjt − yjt }

(8)

We assume that the equity is the only source of external financing. This simplification is
reasonable because we focus on the dynamic relations between stock returns and equity
financing decisions. The relation between stock returns and debt offerings is also interesting
(e.g., Spiess and Affleck-Graves (1999)), but we leave that topic for future research.
External equity financing is costly (e.g., Smith (1977), Lee, Lochhead, Ritter, and Zhao
(1996), Altinkilic and Hansen (2000)). To capture this effect, we follow Gomes (2001) and
Hennessy and Whited (2005) and assume that for each dollar of external equity raised by the
firm, it must pay proportional flotation costs. We also capture fixed costs of equity finance.

7

The total financing-cost function is hence parameterized as:
λjt ≡ λ(ejt ) = λ0 1{ejt >0} + λ1 ejt

(9)

where λ0 > 0 captures the fixed costs, 1{ejt >0} is the indicator function that takes the value
of one if the event described in {·} occurs, and λ1 ejt > 0 captures the proportional costs.
When the sum of investment and adjustment cost is lower than internal funds, the firm
pays the difference back to shareholders. The payout, djt , is thus:
djt ≡ max {0, yjt − ijt − cjt }

(10)

The firm does not incur any costs when paying dividends or conducting share repurchase.
We do not model corporate cash holdings or the specific forms of the payout because these
ingredients are not necessary for our economic questions at hand. Equation (10) only pins
down the total amount paid to shareholders, but not the methods of distribution.
Because there are costs associated with raising capital, but not with distributing payout,
firms will only use external equity as the last resort when internal funds are not sufficient
to finance current investment. Equivalently, it is never optimal to issue new equity while
paying cash back to shareholders.

Dynamic Value Maximization Let v(kjt , zjt , xt ) denote the market value of equity for
firm j. And define:
dejt ≡ djt − ejt − λ(ejt ) = yjt − ijt − cjt − λ(max {0, ijt + cjt − yjt })

(11)

dejt is the effective cash accrued to the shareholder that equals cash distribution minus the

sum of external equity raised and the financing costs. We can now formulate the dynamic
8

value-maximizing problem for firm j as follows:
v(kjt , zjt , xt ) = max dejt +
ijt

ZZ

mt+1 v(kjt+1 , zjt+1 , xt+1 ) Qz (dzjt+1 |zjt ) Qx (dxt+1 |xt )

(12)

subject to the capital accumulation equation (6).

Risk and Expected Return In our model, risk and expected returns are determined
endogenously along with value-maximizing corporate policies. Evaluating the value function
at the optimum yields:
vjt = dejt + Et [mt+1 vjt+1 ]

⇔

1 = Et [mt+1 rjt+1 ]

(13)

where firm j’s stock return is defined as:
rjt+1 ≡

vjt+1
vjt − dejt

(14)

Note that v(kjt , zjt , xt ) is the cum-dividend firm value. Define pjt ≡ vjt − dejt to be the ex-

dividend firm value, then rjt+1 reduces to the usual definition, rjt+1 =

pjt+1 +dejt+1
.
pjt

We can rewrite equation (13) as the beta-pricing form (e.g., Cochrane (2001, p. 19)):
Et [rjt+1 ] = rf t + β jt λmt

(15)

where rf t ≡ Et [m1t+1 ] is the real interest rate from period t to t+1. Risk is defined by:
β jt ≡

−Cov t [rjt+1 , mt+1 ]
Vart [mt+1 ]

(16)

Vart [mt+1 ]
Et [mt+1 ]

(17)

and the price of risk is defined by:
λmt ≡

9

From equations (15) and (16), it is clear that risk and expected returns are two
endogenous variables to be determined along with optimal firm-value and policy functions.
All endogenous variables are functions of three state variables, the endogenous state, k jt ,
and two exogenous states, xt and zjt . The functional forms are not available analytically but
they can be obtained using numerical techniques.

Solving the Model

To solve the model, we first need to calibrate 14 parameters (α, x̄, ρx , σ x , ρz , σ z , η, f , γ 0 , γ 1 ,
δ, a, λ0 , and λ1 ) by matching at least 14 moments. The success of this procedure depends on
picking moments that can identify these parameters. A sufficient condition for identification
is a one-to-one mapping between the vector of parameters and a subset of the data moments
with the same dimension. Although the model does not yield such a closed-form mapping,
we exercise care in choosing appropriate moments to match.
All parameters are calibrated in monthly frequency. We start with three aggregate return
moments including the mean and volatility of real interest rate and the average Sharpe ratio.
As in Zhang (2005b), we use these three moments to pin down tightly the three parameters
in the stochastic discount factor.1 The long-run average level of the aggregate productivity
x̄ is purely a scaling variable. We choose its numerical value to be −3.751 such that the
average long-run level of assets is approximately one.
The persistence of the aggregate productivity, ρx , is set to be

√
3
0.95, and its conditional

volatility, σ x , is set to be 0.007/3 = 0.0023. With the first-order autoregressive specification
for xt in equation (1), these monthly parameter values correspond to quarter values of 0.95
1

Specifically, the log pricing kernel in equations (4) and (5) implies that the real interest rate
2
is
1/E
t [mt+1 ] = (1/η) exp(−µm − (1/2)σ m ) and the maximum Sharpe ratio is σ t [mt+1 ]/Et [mt+1 ] =
p
2
2
2
exp(σ m (exp(σ m ) − 1))/ exp(σ m /2), where µm ≡ [γ 0 +γ 1 (xt −x̄)](1−ρx )(xt −x̄) and σ m ≡ σ x [γ 0 +γ 1 (xt −x̄)].

10

and 0.007, respectively, as in Cooley and Prescott (1995). To choose the persistence ρ z
and conditional volatility σ z of the firm-specific productivity, we follow Gomes, Kogan, and
Zhang (2003) and Zhang (2005b) and restrict these two parameters using the cross-sectional
moments of firm distribution. One direct measure of the dispersion is the cross-sectional
volatility of individual stock returns.

Another measure is the cross-sectional standard

deviation of market-to-book. These goals are achieved by setting ρ z = 0.965 and σ z = 0.10.
Following Hennessy and Whited (2005), we use as empirical targets five simple summary
statistics: the mean and volatility of investment-to-asset, the average ratio of operating
income to assets, the frequency of equity issuance, and the average ratio of net equity to
assets. The average investment-to-asset helps identify the depreciation rate δ, the volatility
of investment-to-asset helps identify the adjustment-cost parameter a, the average operating
income-to-asset ratio helps identify the curvature of the production function α, and the two
financing variables help identify the financing-cost parameters λ0 and λ1 . Finally, we choose
the fixed cost, f , to match the average market-to-book ratio to that in the data.
Table 1 reports our calibration of parameter values. Other than a few exceptions, these
parameter values are similar to those used in Zhang (2005b). Using this parametrization,
we solve the model using the standard value function iteration technique (see Appendix A
for a detailed description of our algorithm). We then simulate the model using the value
function and optimal policy functions to create an artificial panel of 5000 firms with 480
monthly observations for each firm. This procedure is repeated 100 times. Table 2 reports
the model-implied unconditional sample moments averaged across these 100 simulations.
The overall fit reported in Table 2 seems reasonably good. The mean and volatility
of risk-free rate and the average Sharpe ratio simulated from the model are very close to
those observed in the data. This fit is perhaps not surprising because we pin down three

This table reports our parameter choices. We need to calibrate 14 parameters: the capital share α; the longrun average level of aggregate productivity x̄; the persistence of aggregate productivity ρ x ; the conditional
volatility of aggregate productivity shocks σ x ; the persistence of firm-specific productivity ρz ; the conditional
volatility of firm-specific productivity shocks σ z ; the three parameters in the stochastic discount factor η,
γ 0 , and γ 1 ; the fixed cost of production f ; the rate of capital depreciation δ; the adjustment-cost parameter
a; the fixed cost of financing λ0 ; and the proportional factor of financing costs λ1 .

parameters, η, γ 0 , and γ 1 , using exactly these three moments. The model moments of the
investment-to-asset ratio are also close to its data moments. The average market-to-book
ratio in the model, 1.88, is close to that in the data, 1.49. One caveat is that the frequency
of equity issuance in the model, 28.5%, is much higher than that in the data, 9.9%. The
reason is probably that in the model external equity is the only source of outside funds.
Figure 1 plots our numerical solutions of the value function and the optimal investment
policy against the endogenous state variable, capital stock k, and the two exogenous state
variables, aggregate productivity x and firm-specific productivity z. Because there are three
state variables, we first fix x = x̄ and plot the functions against k and z in Panels A and C.
We then fix z = z̄ and plot the functions against k and x in Panels B and D. From Panels A
and B, because of decreasing return to scale, firm value is increasing and concave function of
capital k. The value function also increases with aggregate productivity x and firm-specific
productivity z. From Panels C and D, investment-to-asset decreases with capital stock k but
increases with aggregate and firm-specific productivity. Our model thus predicts that small
firms with relatively less assets-in-place and growth firms with relatively high profitability
tend to invest more and grow faster, consistent with Fama and French (1995).

Based on the optimal investment-to-asset ratio, we plot in Figure 2 the implied new
equity-to-asset ratio and the payout-to-asset ratio from equations (8) and (10). From Panels
A and B, the new equity-to-asset ratio closely mimics the patterns of the investment-to-asset
ratio. Small firms with relatively less capital and growth firms with relatively high firmspecific productivity tend to issue more equity. This prediction is largely consistent with
the evidence documented in Barclay, Smith, and Watts (1995) and Fama and French (2005).
And from Panel B, firms tend to use more equity when aggregate economic conditions are
relatively good, i.e., when x is high, a pattern consistent with the evidence in Choe, Masulis,
and Nanda (1993). Finally, from Panels C and D, the payout-to-asset ratio increases with
capital stock, although the relation is not strictly monotonic. Small firms with less assets
distribute relatively little cash, while big firms with more assets distribute more. This
prediction also is consistent with Barclay et al., who report that dividend yields correlate
positively with the log of total sales, a measure of firm size.

Empirical Implications

We now investigate whether our model can quantitatively reproduce the relations between
stock returns and financing decisions that have attracted considerable attention in recent empirical corporate finance literature. We follow the quantitative-theory approach of Kydland
and Prescott (1982) and Berk, Green, and Naik (1999) to conduct computational experiments to compare the model moments with those in the data. Specifically, we simulate 100
artificial panels, each of which has 5,000 firms and 480 months. And the sample size is comparable to the COMPUSTAT data set often used in empirical studies. We then implement
empirical procedures on each artificial panel, report cross-simulation averaged results, and
compare them to their counterparts in the real data.
We aim at a broad range of empirical studies in the literature. We first study the cyclical
properties of equity issuance as applied to equity issuance waves and the predictive relations between the new equity share and aggregate stock market returns. Then we examine
the long-run stock-price performance and operating performance of issuing firms, as well as
the long-run stock-price performance of cash-distributing firms. Finally, we generate the
negative investment-return relation which is at the heart of our economic mechanisms.

4.1

Equity Issuance Waves

A larger number of firms issue common stocks and the proportion of external financing accounted for by equity is substantially higher in economic expansions (e.g., Taggart (1977),
Marsh (1982), and Choe, Masulis, and Nanda (1993)). In particular, Choe et al. document that the relative frequency of equity offers, defined as the number of equity offerings
per month scaled by the number of listed firms, and the dollar volume of security offerings
scaled by CPI are both procyclical. And in multiple regressions, the new equity share, de16

fined as the ratio of common stock issues to the sum of common stock and bond issues in
dollar volume per month, increases with business cycle measures such as the growth rate
of industrial production, and decreases with stock market volatility. Finally, neither stock
market run-up nor interest rate changes have significant explanatory power in the presence
of business cycle measures and stock market volatility.
We ask whether our model can reproduce these empirical patterns. As in Zhang (2005b),
we define expansions in artificial data to be times when aggregate productivity is at least
one unconditional standard deviation above its long-run average, i.e., xt > x̄+ √σ x 2 . And
1−ρx

we define contractions to be times when aggregate productivity is at least one unconditional
standard deviation below its long-run average, i.e., xt < x̄− √σ x 2 .
1−ρx

We measure the relative frequency of equity issuance in the model as

PN

j=1

1{ejt >0}
N

, where

1{ejt >0} is the indicator function that takes a value of one if firm j issues equity and zero
otherwise. N is the total number of firms in the economy. Because we do not model entry
and exit in the model, N remains constant over time. More important, incorporating entry
and exit is likely to reinforce our basic results. The reason is that the frequency of entry or
Initial Public Offerings tends to be procyclical and the frequency of exit or delisting tends
to be countercyclical, as shown in Pastor and Veronesi (2005).
We define the rate of aggregate equity financing as the total amount of new equity divided
by total assets:

PN

j=1 ejt

PN

j=1

kjt

. And because we do not model debt, we define the new equity share

as the share of new equity out of total amount of financing or the sum of new equity and
internal funds:

PN

PN

j=1 ejt

j=1 (ejt +yjt )

. We caution that our definition of the equity share does not

correspond exactly with the definition in the empirical literature (e.g., Baker and Wurgler
(2000)). But our definition seems to capture the essence underlying the new equity share
without complicating greatly the basic model structure.

Table 3 : Conditional Moments of Equity Issuance
This table reports conditional moments of equity issuance from simulated panels. We report the average
frequency of equity issuance, the rate of aggregate equity financing, and the share of new equity in total
financing, all conditional on the economy being in expansions or contractions. We define expansions in
simulated panels to be times when aggregate productivity is at least one unconditional standard deviation
above its long-run average, i.e., xt > x̄ + √ σ x 2 , and we define contractions to be times when aggregate

The relative frequency of equity issuance is defined in the model as j=1 N jt , where 1{ejt >0} is the

total number of firms in the simulated economy. The

Using simulated panels, we compute the average frequency of equity issuance, the average
rate of aggregate equity financing, and the average new equity share conditional on the
economy being in expansions or contractions. Table 3 reports the results. We observe that
equity issuance is strongly procyclical. The relative frequency of equity issuance is 82.5%
in expansions, and is only 1.5% in contractions. The rate of aggregate equity financing is
3.0% in expansions and is 0.2% in contractions. Finally, the new equity share is 52.6% in
expansions and is only 3.6% in contractions. This procyclical pattern in our simulations is
consistent with the evidence in Choe, Masulis, and Nanda (1993).
We also use simulated data to regress contemporaneously the rate of aggregate equity
financing and the new equity share onto the growth rate of aggregate output, defined as

the rate of aggregate equity financing and the new equity share both correlate positively
with the growth rate of industrial production and with the stock market returns.

4.2

Predicting Stock Market Returns with the New Equity Share

In an important article, Baker and Wurgler (2000) show that the share of new equity issues in
total new equity and debt issues is a strong, negative predictor of future stock market returns.
Baker and Wurgler interpret this evidence as suggesting that firms time the market component of their returns when issuing equity to exploit systematic mispricing in market returns.
We show that our model without mispricing can largely replicate the Baker and Wurgler
19

Table 5 : Univariate, Predictive Regressions of One-Year-Ahead Market Returns
This table reports univariate, predictive regressions of annual percentage stock market returns on three
regressors. The regression equation is rt+1 = a + bXt + et+1 , where rt denotes the real percentage returns
on the value-weighted (vw) market portfolio or the equally-weighted (ew) market portfolio. X t denotes the
regressors including the dividend-to-price ratio, the book-to-market ratio, or the new equity share in the
sum of total new equity and internal funds. The dividend-to-price ratio, the book-to-market ratio, and the
equity share in new issues are standardized to have zero mean and unit variance. We simulate 100 artificial
panels, each of which has 5000 firms and 480 monthly observations. We perform the predictive regressions
on each simulated panel and report the cross-simulation averaged slopes and test statistics. For comparison,
we also report in data columns the results from Table 3 of Baker and Wurgler (2000).

Baker and Wurgler (2000), we standardize all the predictors so that they have zero mean
and unit variance. The rationale is to make the slope coefficients of different regressors
comparable to each other. And as dependent variables, we use annual percentage returns on
both value-weighted and equal-weighted market portfolios.
Table 5 reports the results. The model largely reproduces the predictive regression results
obtained in the data. The dividend yield and the aggregate book-to-market ratio are both
significantly positive predictors of future stock market returns. More important, the new
equity share is a significantly negative predictor of future stock market returns.
We caution again that our definition of the equity share in the model does not correspond
exactly with that in Baker and Wurgler (2000). This difference makes direct comparison be20

tween our simulation results and their evidence somewhat difficult. However, our definition
does capture the basic intuition underlying the predictive power of the new equity share, i.e.,
the strong procyclicality of the new equity share gives rise to its negative correlation with
the countercyclical aggregate expected returns.

4.3

The

Long-Term

Underperformance

Following

Seasoned

Equity Offerings
In an influential contribution, Loughran and Ritter (1995) document that firms issuing equity earn much lower returns on average over the next three to five years than nonissuing
firms with similar characteristics (see also Spiess and Affleck-Graves (1995)). The magnitude
of this underperformance varies over time. Firms issuing during light issuance periods do not
underperform much, while firms issuing during high-volume periods severely underperform.
To study whether our model can quantitatively generate this evidence, we replicate
Loughran and Ritter’s (1995) analysis reported in their Table VIII. Specifically, we use
simulated panels to perform Fama-MacBeth (1973) monthly cross-sectional regressions of
percentage stock returns onto the market value, book-to-market, and an issue dummy:
rjt+1 = b0 + b1 log(MEjt ) + b2 log(BMjt ) + b3 ISSUEjt + jt+1

(18)

where rjt+1 is the percentage return on stock j in from the beginning of month t to the
beginning of month t+1, and all the regressors are dated at the beginning of month t.
We define market value in the model to be the ex-dividend firm value, vjt−dejt , and book-

to-market to be

kjt
.
vjt −dejt

Following Loughran and Ritter (1995), we evaluate MEjt as the

market value of equity of firm j on the most recent fiscal year that ended prior to the month
t. Similarly, BMjt is the book-to-market ratio of firm j on the most recent fiscal year that

21

ended prior to the month t. And ISSUEjt is a dummy variable that takes a value of one if firm
j has conducted one or more equity issues within the previous five years, and zero otherwise,
i.e., ISSUEjt ≡ 1{P59
. We also halve the sample into months following light issuance
τ =0 ejt−τ >0}
activity and months following heavy issuance activity. Specifically, we partition the sample
on the basis of the fraction of the sample firms in a month that have issued equity during
the prior five years. The light-issuance sample has all the months with the fraction below its
median, and the heavy-issuance sample has all the months with the fraction above its median.
From Table 6, the model does a decent job in reproducing the empirical evidence. When
the issue dummy is used alone, issuing firms underperform by 0.49% per month in the
data with a t-statistic of −3.98. And its model counterpart is 0.99% per month with a
t-statistic of −3.87. Controlling for size and book-to-market in the regressions reduces the
underperformance to 0.38% in the data and to 0.64% in the model, and both are significant.
More important, the model also reproduces quantitatively the positive relation between
the magnitude of the underperformance and the volume of equity issuance. In the last two
regressions in Table 6, we divide the sample periods into months following light issuance
activity and months following heavy issuance activity. Loughran and Ritter (1995) show
that issuing firms underperform by an insignificant amount of only 0.17% per month
following light issuance activity but by a significant amount of 0.60% following heavy issuance
activity. From the last column, issuing firms following light issuance activity in the model
underperform by an insignificant 0.32% per month, while issuing firms following heavy
issuance activity underperform by a significant 0.95% per month.

22

Table 6 : Fama-MacBeth (1973) Monthly Cross-sectional Regressions of Percentage
Stock Returns on Size, Book-to-Market, and a New Issues Dummy
This table reports the Fama-MacBeth (1973) monthly cross-sectional regressions: r jt+1 = b0 +b1 log(MEjt )+
b2 log(BMjt )+b3 ISSUEjt +jt+1 , where rjt+1 denotes the percentage return on firm j during month t. MEjt
is the market value of firm j on the most recent fiscal year ending before month t. BMjt is the ratio of the
book value of equity to the market value of equity for firm j on the most recent fiscal year ending before
month t. And ISSUEjt is a dummy variable that equals one if firm j has conducted at least once equity
offerings within the past 60 months preceding month t, and equals zero otherwise. The light-issuance sample
has all the months with the fraction of issuing firms below its median, and the heavy-issuance sample has
all the months with the fraction of issuing firms above its median. We simulate 100 artificial panels, each
of which has 5000 firms and 480 monthly observations. We then perform the cross-sectional regressions on
each simulated panel and report the cross-simulation averaged slopes and Fama-MacBeth t-statistics. We
also compare our results to those reported in Loughran and Ritter (1995, Table VIII).

The Long-Term Operating Performance Following Seasoned
Equity Offerings

In another influential article, Loughran and Ritter (1997) document that the operating
performance of issuing firms displays substantial improvement prior to the equity offerings,
but then deteriorates. Issuing firms are also disproportionately high-investing and highgrowth firms.

The authors interpret their evidence as consistent with Jensen’s (1993)

hypothesis that corporate culture excessively focuses on growth, and managers are as
overoptimistic about the future profitability of the issuing firms as outside investors.
We show that our model without empire-building and overoptimism can quantitatively

23

reproduce the Loughran and Ritter (1997) evidence. To this end, we use simulated panels
to replicate their Table II by reporting the medians of the operating performance for issuing
firms and matching firms for nine years around the issuance. Specifically, following Loughran
and Ritter, we choose matching nonissuers by matching each issuing firm with a firm that
has not issued equity during the prior five years as follows. If there is at least one nonissuer
in the same industry with end-of-year zero assets within 25 to 200 percent of the issuing
firm, the nonissuer with the closest operating income-to-asset ratio is used.2 We also report
the Z-statistics testing the equality of distributions between the issuers and nonissuers using
the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test, and the Z-statistics testing the equality of
distributions between the changes in the ratios from year 0 to year +4.3 Under the null
hypothesis that the issuer and the nonissuer measures are drawn from the same distribution,
Z follows a standard normal distribution.
We consider four operating performance measures: (i) OIBD/assets, where OIBD denotes
operating income before depreciation, measured as
or profitability, measured as
measured as

in the model; (ii) return on assets

in the model, (iii) the investment-to-asset ratio,

in the model; and (iv) market-to-book, measured as

vjt −dejt
kjt

in the model.

Table 7 reports the quantitative results. Consistent with the evidence in Loughran and
Ritter (1997), issuers in the model experience deterioration in the operating performance.
After equity issuance, the operating income-to-asset ratios and profitability of issuers become
significantly lower than those of nonissuers. However, the model-implied operating income2

In the real data, if no nonissuer meets this criterion, Loughran and Ritter (1997) then rank all nonissuers
with year 0 assets of 90 to 110 percent of the issuer, and the firm with the closest, but higher operating
income-to-asset ratio is used. Because we do not distinguish different industries in the model, we simply use
the 25 to 200 percent restriction on end-of-year zero assets to choose matching nonissuer.
3
Denote the difference in the accounting measure between issuer i and its matching firm by diff i ≡
measure(issueri )− measure(nonissueri ). We rank the absolute values of the diff i from 1 to N e , the total
number of issuing firms. We then sum the ranks of positive values of diff i , and denote the sum with D. The

to-asset and profitability levels are on average much higher than those observed in the data.
The reason is probably that the denominator in the model variables corresponds to the fixed
assets in the data, which are only part of the total assets.
What drives the deteriorating accounting performance of firms after issuing equity? Intuitively, the firm-level profitability in the model is driven by the persistent and mean-reverting
firm-specific productivity in equation (2). Therefore, ex-post, issuers tend to be firms that
have recently experienced extremely high firm-specific shocks, εzjt+1 . But going forwards, issuers face the same conditional, standard normal distribution of these shocks as other firms
do. When we as econometricians look at the historical sample, we are likely to observe
the mean-reverting behavior in the cross-sectional difference in productivity, zjt , measured
empirically as the differences in profitability between issuers and matching nonissuers.
Table 7 also shows that issuers in the model have persistently higher investment-to-asset
and market-to-book ratios than matching nonissuers. And from Panel C, these differences
are mostly significant. Moreover, the model does a decent job in matching the mean-reverting
behavior of the investment-to-asset and market-to-book ratios.

4.5

The Long-Term Performance of Firms Distributing Cash

When firms raise capital, they underperform matching firms in the future three to five years.
But when firms distribute cash back to shareholders, they outperform matching firms. For
example, Ikenberry, Lakonishok, and Vermaelen (1995) show that the average abnormal
four-year buy-and-hold return after the announcements of open market share repurchases
is 12.1% in 1980–1990. And the average abnormal return is 45.3% for value firms, but is
insignificantly negative for growth firms. Similarly, Michaely, Thaler, and Womack (1995)
show that stock prices continue to drift in the same direction in the years following the

25

Panels C and D report the Z-statistics testing the equality of distributions between the issuers and matching
nonissuers using the Wilcoxon matched-pairs singed-ranks test. We simulate 100 artificial panels, each of
which has 5000 firms and 480 monthly observations. The monthly flow variables are aggregated within
a given year to create annual variables. Stock variables are measured at the beginning of the year. We
perform the tests on each simulated panel and report the cross-simulation average results. We also compare
our results to those reported in Table II of Loughran and Ritter (1997).

announcements of dividend initiations and omissions.
To study whether our model can quantitatively generate these empirical results, we
replicate Tables 3 and 4 in Ikenberry, Lakonishok, and Vermaelen (1995) using our simulated
panels. In the model, we identify firms with positive dividends as those conducting stock
repurchase in the data. Our model only pins down the total amount of payout, not its specific
forms: the Miller-Modigliani (1991) dividend irrelevancy theorem holds in our neoclassical
model.

We report mean annual returns from buying an equally-weighted portfolio of

repurchasing firms, beginning in the month following the repurchase and for the subsequent
four years. We also report total compounded returns for up to four years, and compare the
returns of the cash-distributing firms to returns of reference portfolio.
We follow closely Ikenberry, Lakonishok, and Vermaelen (1995) in forming our reference
portfolio. All firms in our simulated panel are sorted each month into one of 50 size and
book-to-market portfolios by taking the intersections of ten size deciles and five book-tomarket quintiles. Then all firms are ranked in the beginning of calendar year and are held
for the following 12 months. Beginning in the next month, the one-year buy-and-hold return
is calculated for each firm in a given portfolio. We use the equally-weighted average of all
annual returns in a given portfolio as the benchmark return for the firms ranked in that
particular size and book-to-market portfolio. The ranking of a particular firm may change
from year to year. To accommodate this feature, we allow the benchmark to change over time.
Table 8 reports annual buy-and-hold returns and compounded holding period returns up
to four years following share repurchases, both in the data and in the model. The table
shows that cash-distributing firms indeed earn higher average returns than nondistributing
firms. But the magnitudes of the differences seem much lower in the simulated data than
those in the real data.

Table 8 : Annual Buy-and-Hold Returns and Compounded Holding Period Returns
Up to Four Years Following Market Share Repurchases
This table reports annual and compounded buy-and-hold percentage returns following share repurchases
for up to four years. Compounded holding-period returns assume annual rebalancing. We form equallyweighted portfolios for the whole sample. We construct the reference portfolio using benchmark returns
corresponding to the repurchase sample, matched on the basis of size and book-to-market ranking. To form
reference portfolio, we sort all firms in our simulated panel each month into one of 50 size and book-tomarket portfolios (the intersections of ten size deciles and five book-to-market quintiles). We rank all firms
in the beginning of calendar year and hold them for the following 12 months. Beginning in the next month,
we calculate the one-year buy-and-hold return for each firm in a given portfolio. We then use the equalweighted average of all annual returns in a given portfolio as the benchmark returns for firms ranked in that
particular size and book-to-market portfolio. We rebalance the portfolio annually. We simulate 100 artificial
panels, each of which has 5000 firms and 480 monthly observations. We perform the empirical analysis on
each simulated panel and report the cross-simulation average results. We also compare our results to those
reported in Table 3 of Ikenberry, Lakonishok, and Vermaelen (1995).

We also examine the annual buy-and-hold returns and compounded holding-period
returns following cash distribution by book-to-market quintiles. We rank all firms into
size deciles, and further sort each decile into book-to-market quintiles. The lowest book-tomarket ratios are assigned to quintile one. We form the reference portfolio using benchmark
returns corresponding to the repurchase sample, matched on size and book-to-market.
From Table 9, the model can reproduce the empirical pattern that the magnitude of the
long-run stock-price drift following cash distribution is stronger in value firms than that in
growth firms (e.g., Ikenberry, Lakonishok, and Vermaelen (1995, Table 4)). However, the
magnitudes of the drift in the model are again much lower than that observed in the data.

Table 9 : Annual Buy-and-Hold Returns and Compounded Holding Period Returns
by Book-to-Market Quintiles Following Cash Distribution
This table reports annual and compounded buy-and-hold percentage returns for equally-weighted portfolios
of firms distributing cash for up to four years following market share repurchases by book-to-market quintile
ranking. Compounded holding-period returns assume annual rebalancing. Ranks are determined by sorting
all firms into size deciles. Each decile is further sorted into quintiles on the basis of book-to-market, with the
lowest ratios assigned to quintile one. We form the reference portfolio using benchmark returns corresponding
to the repurchase sample, matched on the basis of size and book-to-market ranking. We create 100 artificial
panels of 5000 firms each and with 480 observations for each firm. The unit time period is one month.
We perform these analysis on each simulated panel and report across-simulation averaged results, and we
compare our results to those reported in Ikenberry, Lakonishok, and Vermaelen (1995, Table 4).

Capital Investment, External Finance, and Stock Returns

The finance-related anomalies are intimately linked to the investment-return relation.
Richardson and Sloan (2003) document that the negative relation between external finance
and future stock returns varies systematically with the use of the proceeds. When the proceeds are invested in net operating assets as opposed to being stored as cash, there exists a
stronger negative relation. And there is no evidence on the negative relation for refinancing
transactions. Lyandres, Sun, and Zhang (2005) document that adding a return factor based
on real investment into calendar-time factor regressions makes underperformance following
equity issuances largely insignificant and reduces its magnitude by 37–46%. This evidence
highlights the importance of capital investment in driving the financing-related anomalies.
To study the investment-return relation in our model, we reproduce the main empirical
analysis of Titman, Wei, and Xie (2004), who recently document a negative, firm-level
relation between capital investment and average subsequent returns.4 Both Richardson and
Sloan and Titman et al. interpret this evidence as investors underreaction to empire building
implications of real investment. As we show below, our model without underreaction or
empire building can quantitatively reproduce the negative investment-return relation.
To this end, we use simulated panels to form five portfolios based on capital investment
(abbreviated as CI hereafter). Following Titman, Wei, and Xie (2004), we define CI that
CE

jt−1
corresponds to the portfolio formation year t as CIjt−1 = (CEjt−2 +CEjt−3
− 1, where
+CEjt−4 )/3

CEjt−1 is firm j’s capital expenditure scaled by sales during year t−1. We measure CE jt−1
in the model as the investment-to-output ratio,

ijt−1
,
yjt−1

because the output price is normalized

to be one. The last three-year moving-average capital expenditure in the denominator of
4

This negative investment-return relation is well-known in the aggregate data, see Cochrane (1991). Other
empirical studies documenting the negative investment-return relation in the firm-level include Anderson and
Garcia-Feijóo (2005), Lyandres, Sun, and Zhang (2005), and Xing (2005).

30

CIjt−1 is used to project the firm’s benchmark investment.
In the beginning of year t, we sort all firms into quintiles based on their year t − 1 CI
measures in ascending order. The firms remain in these portfolios for the whole year t; the
portfolios are rebalanced annually. We then construct a CI-spread portfolio that has a long
position in the two lowest CI portfolios and a short position in the two highest CI portfolios.
The returns for this zero-cost portfolio are calculated by subtracting the average returns of
the highest CI portfolios from the average returns of the lowest CI portfolios.
We also calculate the value-weighted monthly excess returns for each CI portfolio from
year t to t + 1. Following Titman, Wei, and Xie (2004), we measure excess returns relative
to benchmarks constructed to have similar firm characteristics such as size, book-to-market,
and price momentum. Specifically, we form 125 benchmark portfolios that capture these
characteristics. Starting in year t, the universe of common stocks is sorted into five portfolios
based on firm size at the end of year t − 1. And the breakpoints for size are obtained by
sorting all firms into quintiles based on their size measures at the end of year t−1 in ascending
order. The size of each firm in our sample is then compared with the breakpoints to decide
which portfolio the firm belongs to. Firms in each size portfolio are further equally sorted
into quintiles based on their book-to-market ratio at the end of year t−1. Finally, the firms
in each of the 25 size and book-to-market portfolios are equally sorted into quintiles based
on their prior-year return. In all, we obtain 125 benchmark portfolios.
We calculate excess returns using these 125 characteristic-based benchmark portfolios.
Each year, each stock is assigned to a benchmark portfolio according to its rank based on size,
book-to-market, and prior returns. Excess monthly returns of a stock are then calculated
by subtracting the returns of the corresponding benchmark portfolio from the returns of
this particular stock. The excess returns on individual stocks are then used to calculate the
31

value-weighted excess monthly returns on the test portfolios that are formed based on CI.
Table 10 reports the results both in the data and in the simulations. Consistent with
Titman, Wei, and Xie (2004), Panel A reports that firms with low CI earn higher average
returns than firms with high CI. The model-implied average CI-spread is 10.6% per annum,
which falls short of that documented in the data, 16.9%.
We also perform the following Fama-MacBeth cross-sectional regressions
rjt+1 = λ0t + λ1t CIjt + λ2t CIjt × DCFjt + jt+1

(19)

where rjt+1 is the benchmark-adjusted value-weighted return on individual stock i during
period t. DCF is the dummy variable based on the cash flow, measured as operating income
scaled by total assets,

yjt
kjt

in the model. If firm j’s cash flow is above the median cash flow

of the year, DCF equals one, otherwise it equals zero.
Panel B of Table 10 suggests that, consistent with Titman, Wei, and Xie (2004), there
exists a negative correlation between future stock return and capital investment in the simulated data. And the magnitude of this correlation increases with the operating income-toasset ratio, as shown by the negative slope of λ2t for the interaction term, CIjt ×DCFjt . The
model-implied slopes are also quantitatively similar to those observed in the data.

Related Literature

We briefly discuss our connection to the literature in this section.

Brav, Geczy, and

Gompers (2000) document that the underperformance following seasoned equity offerings is
concentrated primarily in small-growth issuing firms, and suggest that the underperformance
reflects a more pervasive return pattern related to size and book-to-market. We provide an

32

Table 10 : Excess Returns of Capital Investment (CI) Portfolios
Panel A presents the distribution of excess returns on five CI portfolios and the CI-spread portfolio. CI
denotes the capital investment measure. We use investment-to-asset ratio to create the CI portfolios.
We report the monthly mean excess returns, the standard deviation, the maximum, the median, and the
minimum of the excess returns. The CI portfolios are constructed as follows. In year t, all stocks are
sorted into quintiles based on their CI measures in ascending order to form five CI portfolios. Valueweighted monthly excess returns on a portfolio are calculated from year t to year t+1. The excess return
on an individual stock at time t is calculated by subtracting the returns of characteristic-based benchmark
portfolios from the stock return at time t. The CI-spread denotes the zero-investment portfolio that has a
long position in the two lowest CI portfolios and a short position in the two highest CI portfolios. The
return series for this portfolio is calculated by subtracting the sum of the returns on the highest two
portfolios from that on the two lowest CI portfolios, and then dividing the result by two. All portfolios
are rebalanced annually. Panel B reports the results of the Fama-MacBeth (1973) cross-sectional regression:
rjt+1 = λ0t +λ1t CIjt +λ2t CIjt DCFjt +jt+1 , where rjt+1 is the benchmark-adjusted value-weighted return on
individual stock j at during month t. DCF is the dummy variable based on cash flow, measured as operating
yjt
income scaled by total assets, measured in the model as kjt
. If the cash flow of one firm is above the median
cash flow of the year, its DCF equals one, and zero otherwise. We simulate 100 artificial panels, each of
which has 5000 firms and 480 monthly observations. The monthly flow variables are aggregated within one
given year to create their corresponding annual variables. We perform the tests on each simulated panel and
report the cross-simulation average slopes and test statistics. We also compare our results to those reported
in Table 1 (Panel A) and Table 6 (Panel A) in Titman, Wei, and Xie (2004).

economic explanation of their evidence because the model suggests that both equity issuers
and small-growth firms are high-investing firms.
Eckbo, Masulis, and Norli (2000) report that a multifactor asset pricing model can reduce
the underperformance to an insignificant level, and argue that issuing firms are less risky
because their leverage ratios are lowered as a result of equity issuance. We complement
their work by suggesting the investment-based mechanism that can potentially drive their
risk evidence. Moreover, Lyandres, Sun, and Zhang (2005) document that even after equity
issuance, issuing firms have book and market leverage ratios substantially higher than those
of matching nonissuers, inconsistent with the leverage explanation of the underperformance.
Schultz (2003) argues that using event studies is likely to find long-term underperformance
ex post, even though there is no underperformance ex ante.5 Weighing each period equally as
in calendar-time factor regressions solves this problem. We add to Schultz’s (2003) pseudomarket-timing insight in two ways. First, we provide an economic explanation for his key
premise that firms are more likely to issue when stock prices are high so they can receive more
for their equity. We show that optimal equity financing is highly procyclical, i.e., firms invest
more and thus naturally issue more equity in expansions when stock prices are relatively high.
Second, our argument applies to event-time as well as calendar-time evidence because the
model predicts that issuing firms are expected to earn lower rates of returns ex ante.
Our work is also related to several other papers casting some doubt on behavioral market timing, but from the perspective of capital structure choice. Leary and Roberts (2005)
argue that the persistence of leverage is likely driven by dynamic optimizing behavior with
adjustment costs. Hennessy and Whited (2005) construct a dynamic trade-off model with
5

If early in a sample period, issuing firms underperform, there will be few issues in the future because
investors are less interested in them. The average performance will be weighed more towards the early issues
that underperformed. If early issuing firms outperform, there will be many more issues in the future. The
early performance will be weighed less in the average performance.

endogenous leverage, payout, and investment and show that leverage varies negatively with
an external-finance-weighted-average Q, a result documented by Baker and Wurgler (2002).
Strebulaev (2003) constructs a dynamic trade-off model of capital structure with adjustment
costs and show that the model can reproduce the empirical relation between leverage and
stock return documented by Welch (2004). Liu (2005) shows that historical market-to-book
and stock return obtain their explanatory power of leverage because of adjustment costs and
the time-varying nature of the target leverage. None of these papers studies the predictive
relation between past financing decisions and future stock returns, i.e., the return-related
evidence of behavioral market timing. Our work fills this gap.
More generally, our work is related to the literature that tries to understand the economic
determinants of the anomalies in the cross section of returns by analyzing firm decisions
(e.g., Berk (1995), Berk, Green, and Naik (1999), Gomes, Kogan, and Zhang (2003), Carlson, Fisher, and Giammarino (2004, 2005), Kogan (2004), Cooper (2005), and Zhang (2005a,
2005b)). Except for Carlson et al. (2005), these papers do not study the quantitative relation
between equity financing and stock returns. We contribute to the literature along this line.

Conclusion

We use a fully-specified neoclassical model augmented with costly equity financing as a
laboratory to study the quantitative relations between stock returns and equity financing.
Simulations show that the model can simultaneously and in many cases quantitatively
reproduce: (i) procyclical equity issuance; (ii) the predictive relation between aggregate
equity share and stock market returns; (iii) long-term underperformance following equity
issuance and the positive relation of its magnitude with the volume of issuance; and (iv) the
mean-reverting behavior in the operating performance of issuing firms. Our model does not
35

have apparent behavioral bias, we suggest that the evidence often interpreted as behavioral
underreaction to market timing or the window-of-opportunity theory of financing decisions
can be potentially consistent with efficient markets.
However, although going in the right direction, our quantitative results on the positive
long-term stock price drift of cash-distributing firms and the positive relation between its
magnitude and book-to-market are fairly weak. Improving the quantitative performance of
the model along this dimension remains a significant challenge for future research.

Computational Appendix

We use the value function iteration procedure to solve the individual firm’s problem given
in equation (12). We solve the value function and the optimal decision rule on a grid in a
discrete state space.
We specify a grid with 50 points for the capital stock with an upper bound k. The upper bound is large enough to be nonbinding at all times. We construct the grid for capital
stock recursively, following McGrattan (1999), i.e., ki = ki−1 + ck1 exp (ck2 (i − 2)), where
i = 1, . . . , 50 is the index of grid points and ck1 and ck2 are two constants chosen to provide
the desired number of grid points and k, given a pre-specified lower bound k. This recursive
construction assigns more grid points around k, where the value function has most of its
curvature. The state variables x and z in equations (1) and (2), respectively, are defined
on continuous state spaces. And to compute the numerical solution to the model, we need
to transform the continuous state spaces into discrete state spaces. Because both productivity processes are highly persistent in monthly frequency, we use the method described in
Rouwenhorst (1995). We use 15 grid points for x process and 17 points for z process. In all
cases our quantitative results are robust to finer grids.
Once the discrete state space is available, the conditional expectation operator in (12) can
be carried out as a matrix multiplication. The expected return Et [rjt+1 ] = Et [vjt+1 ]/(vjt −djt )
can be calculated in the same way. We use piecewise linear interpolation extensively to
obtain firm value, optimal investment, and expected return, which do not lie directly on the
grid points. Finally, we use discrete, global search routine in maximizing the right-hand side
of the value function (12). This routine is slow but precise. Specifically, we compute the
objective function on an even-spaced grid of k, with boundary [k, k] with 20,000 points. The
computer programs for solving the value function and for simulating the model are available
upon request.
