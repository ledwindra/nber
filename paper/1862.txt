New Results on the Effects of Tax Policy
on the International Location of Investment

ABSTRACT

We study the effects of tax laws on foreign direct investment (FDI)
and direct investment abroad (DIA), distinguishing in each case between
investment financed by retained earnings and investment financed by
transfers from abroad. We find that tax policy, through its effect on
the rate-of-return available in the U.S., has an important effect on the
international location of investment. FDI in the U.S. is very sensitive
to after-tax rates-of-return available here. U.S. direct investment
abroad is also affected, although to a lesser extent.

We use these estimates to examine the effects of the 1981-82 tax
changes on the international location of investment. We estimate that
the tax changes lowered annual DIA by $0.5 billion to $1.0 billion (2%
to 4% of its 1980 value), and raised annual FDI by $2 billion to $4
billion (11% of 20% of its 1980 value). We also discuss the welfare
effects of tax policy toward international investment.
Our results suggest that the tax effects on the international
location of investment are important. Tax policies, such as ACRS and
the ITC, which raise the after tax rate-of-return on new investment
without losing revenue from previous investment, not only stimulate
domestic fixed investment, but also attract additional investment from
abroad. The additional investment supplements the domestic investment
impact on productivity and raises corporate tax revenue. However, our
results should be taken as preliminary estimates, not as definitive
statements about the long-run impacts of tax policy.

Introduction
Foreign direct investment (FDI) in the United States and U.S.

direct investment abroad (DIA) are important economic phenomena as well

as a source of political controversy. In 1980, FDI reached $17 billion,
about 22% as large as net domestic fixed investment. Correspondingly,
DIA reached $19 billion, about 25% as large as net domestic investment

in plant and equipment. Since 1980, substantial FDI has continued,

whereas DIA has fallen precipitously. Further, the sources of finance
for FDI and the uses of earnings on DIA have changed dramatically in the
past few years.

These flows --

in

both directions - -

have become a concern of tax

policy. For example, the adoption of the Accelerated Cost Recovery
System (ACRS) in 1981, as amended in 1982, was expressly limited to

investment in the United States. While the primary motivation behind
ACRS was to increase U.S. domestic capital formation, a secondary
concern, evidenced in the hearings preceding its adoption, was to stem

the flow of U.S. investment abroad. Further, FDI is often seen as an
important justification for continuing the U.S. corporate income tax,

even by those who favor corporate and personal tax integration. Another
example of revenue (and perhaps location of investment) concern is the
per country limitation to the foreign tax credit in the Administration's
tax reform proposal.

Multinational firms undoubtedly invest outside their home country

for a wide variety of reasons: access to markets, political
considerations, labor costs, proximity to suppliers, and expected economic

conditions, to name a few. Often, the reasons may be industry, firm, or
even product-specific. Given these other forces shaping the
international location of investment, however, tax laws potentially

1

affect the attractiveness of U.S. direct investment abroad, and foreign
direct investment in the U.S., as well as the repatriation of earnings

and/or capital. The major changes in U.S. domestic investment
incentives enacted in 1981 and 1982 (ERTA and TEFRA,

respectively)

combined with the trends in FDI and DIA, as well as current tax reform
proposals which might affect tax rates on DIA and FDI substantially,
lead us to reexamine the question of the extent to which tax policy
appears to influence the international location of investment.
We begin in Section 2 with a brief literature review, focusing on
the differing effects on the location of investment of tax policy toward

domestic investment and toward foreign source income. The argument in
Hartman (1981, 1984, 1985) --

that

foreign investment financed by

retained earnings should not be influenced by the (deferred) home
country tax on foreign source income -

- is

presented and some caveats

suggested.

Section 3 presents a description of recent trends in FDI and DIA,
their sources of finance and their uses, as well as their industrial

composition and origin or location, respectively. It also describes the
data used in our study.
Section 4 presents our empirical results.

First, for the period

1965-79, we compare our results using revised data to those of Hartman.
The results are fairly robust to the data revisions.

Next, for both FDI

and DIA we use revised data on extended sample periods and several
alternative functional forms and combinations of variables to test the

impact of tax policy on FDI and DIA. We conclude that tax policy can
have significant effects on the international location of investment.
Our results are similar to the quantitative estimates in Hartman's

2

several studies f:)r so; of the effects, but they are only about one-

third to onehalf as large for others, e.g., the impact of U.S. domestic
tax policy on U.S. direct investment abroad.

Section 5 presents a brief summary and conclusion, including rough
estimates of the likely impacts of recent tax policy and current
proposals on the international location of investment, and an analysis
of the welfare effects of taxation of FDI and DIA.

2.

A Brief Review of the Literature
The effects of domestic tax policy on the international location of

investment occur primarily through two channels: home country tax
policy towards investment in the home country, and home country tax
policy towards foreign source income.1
Domestic tax policy towards investments made in the home country

affect both FDI in the home country and DIA by home country firms. This
occurs because tax policy alters the relative rates-of-return available
at home and abroad.

Entrepreneurs investing capital will naturally be

attracted to locations where the (risk-adjusted) rate-of-return is

highest.2 Of course, this channel hinges on the substitutability
of foreign and domestic investment for a firm. However, the common
conception of foreign and domestic investment as alternative methods of
producing the same good and/or serving the same (geographic) market
suggests that there is some substitution between locations of

1. The home country is where the parent company is based.
2. Issues concerning risk adjustment are not addressed in this paper.

investment. Moreover, as discussed in Hartman (1981), if there are
financial constraints on firms, there will be a clear tradeoff between

foreign and domestic opertions. Thus, there are good theoretical reasons
for domestic tax policy to affect both FDI and DIA through its effects

on relative rates-of-return. Empirically, this view has been supported
by results in Hartman (1981, 1984) and below.

The importance of taxes on foreign source income has long been a

subject of debate. There are two major approaches to taxation of
foreign source income. In the "territorial" approach, the company pays
no home country taxes on foreign income. In the "residence" approach,
the company does pay home country taxes, but often a credit or deduction

is allowed for taxes paid in the host country. The United States taxes
with the residence approach, but allows a credit for taxes paid to other
countries.

Research in the 1960s and 1970s focused largely on the issue of
"capital export neutrality," the equivalent tax treatment of the foreign

and domestic returns of multinational companies. In this regard, it was
argued that, under a residential system with a credit for foreign taxes,

the ability to defer taxation on foreign source income conferred a tax
advantage toward investment abroad.3
This view has been challenged by Hartman (1981, 1984, 1985).

Hartman properly draws attention to the distinction between investment

3. See Bergsten, Horst, and Moran (1978) or Caves (1982) for a review of
this position.

4

financed out of retained earnings abroad and investment financed by

transfers from home. If the subsidiary is investing out of retained
earnings, the home country tax on foreign source income does not affect
the marginal investment decision, because the repatriation of earnings,

not the earnings themselves, are the tax base. The home country tax on
foreign source income is unavoidable, and its present value does not

depend on the length of deferral. Thus, the marginal investment
decision for investment out of retained earnings should depend only on

net returns available in the home country or the host country. Hartman
calls this "capital import neutrality", i.e., the same tax rates
influence the decisions of both U.S. firms in the U.S. and foreign firms
in the U.S. that finance investment by retained earnings.4
For firms that finance foreign investment by transfers from home,
the home country tax on foreign source income does matter because no

foreign earnings have accrued and thus the tax on foreign source income

is avoidable. One implication of this theory is that a foreign
affiliate should never simultaneously repatriate earnings and draw funds
from home, since this creates a completely avoidable tax liability.
Hartman defines firms that finance foreign investment by retention of
earnings as "mature" firms, those that finance investment by transfers

4. However, even when the tax on foreign source income is not a concern, it
is not the case that foreign firms in the U.S. respond to the same tax
rates as do U.S. firms. Foreign firms care about the tax rate paid at
the corporate level. U.S. firms should respond to the total effective
tax rate. These rates are developed in Feldstein, Dicks-Mireaux, and
Poterba (1983) and Feldstein and Jun (1986). They do not always move in
tandem. Moreover, it would be easy to design policies that affect the
rates differently, e.g., the current tax reform bill HR3838.

5

from home as "immature". He argues that a large part of U.S. DIA is
undertaken by mature firms, since approximately 70% of DIA in 1975-79

was financed by retained earnings. Thus, he concludes, "the size of the
U.S. tax burden on foreign source income should be irrelevant for

investment decisions." (1985, p. 119)
Several caveats apply to this conclusion. First, it should be
noted that neither we nor Hartman test this proposition. Second, in
recent years DIA financed by retained earnings has risen while DIA has

fallen, suggesting a re-examination of the issues. Third, domestic
treatment of foreign source income will not matter for timing of
repatriation only if the domestic tax rate is known and thought to be

permanent. If major tax policy revisions occur frequently (as has in
fact occurred), then a firm will have an incentive to wait for lower
rates.

3.

Data
A.

Introduction

Foreign direct investment refers to the infusion of funds into a
U.S. subsidiary by the foreign parent or the retention of earnings by

that subsidiary. The Bureau of Economic Analysis defines a U.S.
affiliate as "a U.S. business enterprise in which a foreign person owns

or controls, directly or indirectly, at least 10% of the voting
securities if an incorporated U.S. business enterprise or an equivalent

interest if an unincorporated business enterprise."5 U.S. direct

investment abroad is defined equivalently for the foreign subsidiaries
of U.S. parent companies.6

Two aspects of this definition merit comment. First, foreign
direct investment and direct investment abroad are not necessarily the

dominant aspects of international capital flows. As of end-of-year
1984, foreign direct investment in the U.S. accounted for approximately
18% of all foreign assets in the United States, while U.S. direct
investment abroad represented 25% of U.S. assets abroad (Scholl (1985)).

Second, foreign direct investment is not the exact counterpart to

domestic net investment figures. For example, inflows of funds (or
retention of earnings) are not necessarily used to purchase real capital

assets, so FDI may overstate real foreign net investment. On the other
hand, U.S. borrowing by the U.S. subsidiary is not part of the

calculation of FDI. Hartman (1984) suggests that it is reasonable to

use FDI figures as net foreign investment. Hartman (1981) shows that an
equivalent proposition also holds for U.S. direct investment abroad.
B.

Trends

Summary data for foreign direct investment in the U.S. and U.S.
direct investment abroad are presented in Tables 1, 2, and 3.
As shown in Table 1, foreign direct investment has grown 2000% in

real terms from 1950 to 1984. Large swings characterize the last third

of this period, with tremendous growth from 1977 to 1981, a collapse of

50% in 1982 and 1983, and a doubling in 1984. FDI figures are also
large in relative terms. In every year since 1980, FDI has been more
than 20% of U.S. nonresidential net investment in plant and equipment.

This is especially noteworthy for 1984, because net investment in the

U.S. rose by over 100% of its 1983 level. The composition of the
sources of FDI has changed over time. Since 1977, the percentage of FDI
financed by retained earnings has fallen substantially. This has
occurred contemporaneously with the large rise in FDI documented in
column 1, thus suggesting that investment financed by intercompany debt

and equity flows has dominated FDI in recent years. Finally, column 4
shows that the reinvestment ratio for FDI income has also fallen since
1982, though it was relatively stable in earlier periods.

U.S. direct investment abroad, shown in Table 2, grew steadily
through 1979, but has since collapsed, representing a large and
continuing repatriation of funds to the U.S.

Real DIA in 1984 is only

2% higher than it was in 1950. These notions are reinforced by
examination of DIA as a percentage of U.S. nonresidential net

investment. DIA was consistently 20% or more of net investment in the
l960s and l970s but has collapsed to 11% or less since 1981. The
composition of DIA finance, shown in column 3, has undergone extreme

gyrations in recent years. Nevertheless, the reinvestment ratio for DIA
income has remained relatively stable.

Table 3 provides a snapshot of the level and composition of the

U.S. positions in FDI and DIA as of the end of 1984. Both FDI and DIA
have accummulated substantial positions. Approximately one-third of the
FDI position is in manufacturing and one-sixth in petroleum. These two

industries also account for 40% and 25% of the DIA position,

respectively. Not surprisingly, European countries account for the
largest share of both positions. Although Japan accounts for only 9.3%
of the FDI position, it should be noted that this figure has risen from

2.1% in 1975 and 6.4% in 1979. Moreover, as noted above, capital
inflows may occur predominantly in forms other than FDI.

Thus, even a cursory examination of the data suggests that both FDI

and DIA can be substantial. The wide swings suggest further that
international investment flows may be very sensitive to current or

anticipated conditions. Before proceeding to a more formal analysis,
however, issues concerning the data should be noted.
C. Sources

All data in FDI and DIA have been obtained from either Selected

Data on Foreign Direct Investment in the U.S., 1950-79; Selected Data
on U.S. Direct Investment Abroad, 1950-76; or the annual surveys of
these topics in the Survey of Current Business, all of which are
publications of the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA).
BEA develops these series by conducting occasional "benchmark"

surveys of virtually all firms involved in FDI or DIA. They construct
between year data by conducting annual sample surveys and extrapolating
the total figures based on the firms in the sample surveys and the

previous benchmark survey. Thus, as the time since the latest benchmark
survey increases, the chance of mis-estimation would seem to increase.

BEA conducted DIA benchmark surveys in 1966, 1977, and 1982. FDI
surveys were undertaken in 1974 and 1980.

The 1980 FDI survey in particular generated substantial revisions

in data for 1980 and later dates. For example, the direct investment
position in FDI was revised upward by 21%, capital inflows (i.e.

9

foreign direct investment) were revised upward by 24%, and FDI income

was revised downward by 9% (Belli, 1984). With these revised data for
1980, the direct investment position rose 52% from its 1979 value, and

FDI was 42% higher than in 1979. Note that BEA did not revise the data
from the 1970s based on the 1980 benchmark survey.
There is reason to believe that a substantial part of the abrupt
junips in these series is due to underreporting during the 1970s.

Specifically, BEA estimates that about 75% of the revision in the
capital inflows figure was accounted for by affiliates that should have
reported in the annual sample surveys but did not.7

One additional concern is that through 1979 BEA collected retained

earnings for incorporated affiliates only. In 1980, unincorporated
affiliates began to report retained earnings too. Thus, the series

"investment financed by retained earnings" re below) refers to
incorporated affiliates only through 1979, and all affiliates in 1980

and thereafter. BEA presented separate data for incorporated and
unincorporated affiliates for 1980-83, but has since discontinued the
practice.

To account for the problems with the data discussed above, we have

7. Belli, p. 34. BEA estimates that all of the revision in capital inflows
was due to underreporting, but 25% of the underreporting was by exempt
affiliates. For the direct investment position, two-thirds of the upward
revision was due to underreporting, one-third due to revision or
correction in the sample data. BEA does not state what part of the
underreporting of direct investment position should have been reported,
but if (as for capital inflows) 75% of the underreporting should have
been reported, then one-half (2/3 x 3/4) of the upward revision in
direct investment position should have been reported in the sample
survey. This suggests that the position in FDI was also substantially
underreported in the l970s.

alternative

specifications. The alternatives are

discussed with other regression results in Section 4.

All tax rate and rate-of-return data have been generously supplied

by Martin Feldstein and Joosung Jun (1986). Data on U.S. gross national
product, actual and middle cycle expansion path, have been taken from
the Economic Report of the President, 1985 and de Leeuw and Holloway

(1983). Data concerning gross domestic product in OECD countries were
obtained from National Accounts of OECD Countries, 1950-68 and 1950-78,
and OECD Main Economic Indicators in recent years.

4. Results

Table 4A presents FDI equations for 1965-79 estimated by us and

Hartman (1984). The data that Hartman used were presented in an
Appendix to that article. Our results use a revised tax rate and rateof-return series presented in Feldstein and Jun (1986). Our results
with the original data are very close to Hartman's. With the revised
data, our estimates of the effects of taxes and rates-of-return are
still similar to Hartman's especially for the retained earnings

equations. For the equations examining I, our estimates show a
decline in the elasticities with respect to foreigners' net return in

the U.S., to 0.9 from 1.2 in the I/Y equation, and to 0.8 from 1.0 in
the retention ratio equation. We also find a lower elasticity for the
relative tax term.8 None of the point estimates changes by more

8. The relative tax term is meant to capture differences between domestic
saving incentives and investment incentives. Thus, a savings incentive
that lowered t' but not t would then increase savings, lower the pre-tax
rate of return and thus lead to a fall in FDI.

11

than one standard deviation. We are thus heartened by the stability of
the major qualitative conclusions and quantitative results for the I
equations. The results hold up well with either the original or revised

data. The

equations seem to be slightly more sensitive to the data

revisions. The t-statistics and relative magnitudes of the coefficients
do remain stable, though.

In Table 4B, we present basic results for DIA in the 1965-79

period. Here, the data revisions have no effect on the sensitivity of
DIA to its own

rate-of-return.

The effect is quite strong (the

elasticity calculated at mean values is approximately 1.4) and

statistically significant. Our estimates of the response of DIA to the
net return in the U.S., however, are approximately one-third the size of
Hartman's.

(We estimate an elasticity of 0.2, compared to Hartman's

0.66). Our estimates, like Hartman's, found that the after-tax return
is the relevant measure; the coefficients on gross return are equal and
opposite in sign to the coefficients on gross return times the total

effective tax rate. As with the net return, Hartman's coefficients are
three times as large as ours. These basic equations appear to fit the
data well. Nevertheless, the data revisions seem to have an important
effect on the sensitivity of DIA to variations in the net-of-tax return
in the U.S.

In summary, except for the I/Y equation for FDI and the elasticity
of DIA with repect to net return in the U.S., we obtain results very
similar to Hartman (1981, 1984), even with revised tax rate and rate-ofreturn data.

A. New Results for Foreign Direct Investment

Tables 5A and 5B present new results for FDI. In these equations

12

we extend the sample forward to 1984, and in some cases backward to 1956,

use the revised series mentioned above, and experiment with a variety of

alternative explanatory variables and functional forms. Estimates can
vary substantially depending on the assumptions made.

Table 5A presents regressions explaining the log of various foreign

direct investment rates. The second equation shows typical results for
the addition of alternative explanatory variables.

In short, the basic

rate-of-return and tax variables seem to contain most of the explanatory
power.

For 1965-84, the elasticity of (I/Y) is estimated to be 1.0 with
respect to its own rate of return, 1.9 with respect to the average
foreigners' net return in the U.S., and -2.9 with respect to the

relative tax term. Compared to results for 1965-79, the estimates in
column 2 show a smaller response to return on FDI, and a much larger
response to foreigners net return in the U.S. and relative taxes.
Results are presented for the 1956-84 period, too, in order to

demonstrate the sensitivity to sample period. These results imply
smaller elasticities than the results for 1965-79 or 1965-84.

The retention ratio is modelled in columns 3 and 4. We found
elasticities for 1956-84 and 1965-84 that bracket the 1965-79 estimates

for foreigners' net return in the U.S. and relative tax rates. In each
case the elasticity for 1965-84 is largest. The estimates show a
considerable degree of variation. For the return on FDI, the 1965-79
estimates show the largest elasticity.

The equations modelling investment financed by transfers fit

poorly, as was the case in the 1965-79 sample period. Various
modifications, including the addition of output variables, dummies for
various periods and alternative functional forms do not alter this result.

13

Turning to other functional forms, Table 5B presents results for
linear equations in the rate and level of the variables used in Table

5A. In general, these equations do not perform as well as the
logarithmic equations. The coefficients have the correct signs and take
on reasonable values. Using mean values over the sample period, the
elasticity of :[r/Y with respect to the return on FDI is 2.0, with
respect to foreigners' net return in the U.S. is 0.8, and with respect

to the relative tax term is -2.0. Correspondingly, for the retention
ratio, the elasticities for the 1965-84 period are 1.0, 2.3, -4.2,

respectively. Columns 2 and 3 show that, again, regressions extending
backward to 1956 do not perform as well. These coefficients imply
elasticities ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 for foreigners' net return in the
U.S. ,

0.6

to 0.7 for return on FDI, and -1.4 to -2.9 for relative taxes.

We also employed several alternative specifications including a

dummy variable to capture the negative re in 1982, instrumental
variables to account for potential endogeneity of the return on FDI,
expanding the values of FDI (by 20%) in the late 1970's to proxy for the
underreporting discussed in section 3, and alternative output terms.
The overriding result of these alternative specifications is, as the
Tables above would suggest, that the estimates are fairly sensitive to
the specifications made.

B. New Results for Direct Investment Abroad
Table 6 presents some basic extensions of the DIA results given in

Table 4B. The results are presented only for I*/Y as the other two
equations fit poorly over the entire period. The I*r equations, in
rates and level, tend to confirm strongly our earlier estimates, from
Table 4B. In particular, the net return in the U.S. enters with an

14

elasticity of approxinateiy -0.2 in each specification, while the net

return abroad has an elasticity estimated at 1.2 to 1.3. Alternative
specifications led to varying results, and are not reported here.
In summary, our empirical research supports the notion that

domestic tax policy can have a significant impact on DIA and FDI. Our
results are similar to Hartman's for 1965-79, although our elasticity
estimates are somewhat smaller for the response of DIA to a change in
net returns in the U.S. and for the response of FDI to changes in the
return on FDI.

5. Summary and Implications

We have presented above new evidence that U.S. domestic tax policy

affects the international location of investment. While the results are
somewhat sensitive to sample period, functional form and other

considerations, the qualitative conclusions tend to hold up well. Of
particular interest are two empirical issues -

the likely impact of the

1981-82 corporate tax changes on FDI and DIA and the corresponding

potential effects of any corporate tax reform. Also important are the
welfare aspects of international location of investment.

Our estimates of the impact on DIA of changes in the after-tax
rate-of-return in the U.S. suggest that a reduction of approximately
four cents of DIA occurs for every dollar of increased U.S. domestic

investment. This estimate derives from a comparison of analogous
coefficients on domestic investment equations estimated by Feldstein and

Jun (1986) This refers only to investment out of retained

9. This estimate is obtained as follows. Feldstein and Jun (1986) regress
net investment divided by GNP on several variables, including the
(lagged) overall net rate-of-return. Their coefficient on the rate-of-

15

earnings. It is likely that transfers from domestic parent companies to
foreign subsidiaries, or the establishment of such subsidiaries, is also

responsive to domestic tax policy, but the data are insufficient to
reach any specific conclusions on the matter.

We estimate that a tax policy which raises the after-tax rate of
return enough to lead to a dollar of increased domestic investment in
the U.S. brings with it between eight and twenty-seven cents of

FDI)° These results are consistent with those found in Hartman
(1981, 1984).

Several studies have attempted to study the effect of the 1981-82
investment incentives on effective marginal tax rates (e.g.

,

see

Auerbach (1983), Feldstein and Jun (1986), Gravelle (1983), and Hulten
and Robertson (1983).

These studies generally find that the effective

corporate tax rate was reduced by about 20% to 35%

11

With a

constant before-tax rate-of-return and a pre-ERTA effective tax rate of
about 33%, the tax changes increased foreigners' average net return in

the U.S. by 10% to 17%. Other things equal, our estimates suggest that

return variable is .459. When our equations are transformed into the
appropriate units (i.e., when coefficients are divided by 1000; see note
in Table 6), our estimate of the effect of net rate-of-return in the
U.S. on U.S. Direct Investment Abroad is - .016, which is about 4% as
large (in absolute value) as .459.
10. This is obtained by multiplying the elasticity of 're" with respect to
Foreigners' net return in the U.S. (shown in columns 1 and 2, Table 5A)
by the average value of foreigners' net return in the U.S. (.054) and
dividing by the average of the (transformed) 'r (.00355).
11. Studies differ in their estimates because of differing assumptions about
expected inflation, discount rates, debt/equity ratios, and hurdle
rates, among other things.

16

this change in net return would bring about approximately a 2% to 4%

decline in DIA and an 11% to 20% rise in FDI. This would imply capital
inflows of about $0.5 billion to $1.0 billion from smaller DIA and $2

billion to $4 billion in increased FDI. Of course, these figures refer
to FDI and DIA out of retained earnings only. Likewise, a tax reform
such as H.R.3838, which raises (except perhaps at very high inflation

rates) the effective tax rate on U.S. corporate investment, would result
in an increase in direct investment abroad by U.S. firms and a decrease

in foreign direct investment in the U.S. However, because these results
contain no long term dynamic theory of the optimal international
location of investment, they should not be taken as any final guide to
the impacts of these tax changes on investment patterns.
Finally, the welfare economics of the international location of

investment, described in Caves (1982), Goulder, Shoven, and Whalley
(1983), and Hartman (1984) should be addressed. Domestic economic
welfare rises with FDI because the U.S. receives a claim on the rate-ofreturn to foreign capital through the taxation of FDI income.
Conversely, domestic economic welfare falls when U.S. firms substitute
DIA for investment at home,12 because the nation then receives only
the net-of-foreign-tax return (and that only when it is repatriated)

rather than the gross return. These welfare effects are augmented by
the beneficial effects on labor productivity of greater investment -

foreign

or domestic -

in

the United States. Thus, a reduction in

12. Of course, not all DIA comes at the expense of domestic investment.

taxation of new corporate investment improves welfare through three

channels: the standard mechanism, through which lowering the effective
marginal tax rate generates new domestic investment opportunities for
U.S. firms; a reallocation of the location of investment by U.S. firms

toward home and away from abroad; and an increase in FDI. In this
paper, we have presented some new evidence that these last two effects

are quantitatively important and therefore that it is necessary to
consider them in any evaluation of domestic investment incentives.
The welfare effects of tax policy clearly depend on the

responsiveness of FDI and DIA to net-of-tax returns. The welfare gains
to a tax reduction confined to new corporate investment are positively
linked to the responsiveness of DIA and negatively linked to the
responsiveness of FDI with respect to net-of-tax returns in the U.S.
Our results suggest that accelerated depreciation or tax credits
for new investment which decrease the effective marginal tax rate paid
at the corporate level by 10% would, through its effect on the net-of-

return available to FDI, raise FDI by 9%. Corporate tax revenues from
taxation of FDI could be expected to rise correspondinly. Similar,
though smaller, revenue effects would occur for DIA. These results
refer to investment financed by retained earnings only. Note, however,
that tax revenue is greater per dollar of potential DIA diverted to

domestic investment than per dollar of FDI, because foreign owners of
U.S. capital pay taxes only at the corporate level, while domestic
owners are also responsible for state, local, and personal taxes.
Our results suggest that the tax effects on the international

location of investment are important. Tax policies, such as ACRS and
ITC, which raise the after tax rate-of-return on new investment without

18

losing revenue from previous investment, not only stimulate domestic
fixed investment, but also attract additional investment from abroad.
The additional investment supplements the domestic investment impact

productivity and raises corporate tax revenue.

on

However, our results

should be taken as preliminary estimates, not as definitive statements
about the long-run impacts of tax policy.

Notes:
a. Foreign Direct Investment is financed either by retention of earnings or
by intercompany flows of equity or debt.
Retained earnings are negative

of the President, 1985, Table B-15, p.

when dividend payments to equity holders are larger than earnings.
Intercompany flows are net figures and are negative when more funds flow
out of the U.S. subsidary than into it.
Thus, the ratio listed above may
be greater than 100% or less than 0.
In 1982, retained earnings were
negative.

b. This ratio measures FDI financed by retained earnings divided by FDI
income. It can be negative for the reasons stated in note a.

Notes:

a. I
is Foreign Direct Investment financed by retained earnings.This series is multiplied
by l06 and divided by GNP to obtain
b. E represents income from Foreign Direct Investment. Income = earnings + interest(net of
witholding taxes) - withholding taxes on distributed earnings.
c. It refers to investment financed by transfers of funds into the country. This series is
also multiplied by 1000 and divided by CNP. Moreover, since It is negative in 1971, Hartman
adds 1.676 billion to It before transforming. To allow comparability, we add this constant
too.

d. Our results use the updated series provided by Feldstein and Jun. Our estimates using
the data presented in Hartman (1984) are very close to our results in this table.
e. Return on FDI is calculated as income from Foreign Direct Investment divided by end-ofyear Direct Investment Position (in FDI) for the previous year.
f. Foreigners' return in the U.S. is defined as the overall gross-rate of return times one
minus the tax rate paid at the corporate level.
g. The relative tax term =
where t' = the total effective tax rate, t = tax
rate paid at the corporate level.
