We call such bubbles \"intrinsic\" bubbles because they derive all of their variability from exogenous economic fundamentals, and none from extraneous factors. Unlike the most popular examples of rational bubbles, intrinsic bubbles provide an empirically plausible account of deviations from present-value pricing. Their explanatory potential comes partly from their ability to generate persistent deviations that appear relatively stable over long periods.\n\n",
