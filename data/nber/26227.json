    "abstract": "\n\nA key challenge for research on many questions in the social sciences is that it is difficult to link historical records in a way that allows investigators to observe people at different points in their life or across generations.  In this paper, we develop a new approach that relies on millions of record links created by individual contributors to a large, public, wiki-style family tree.  First, we use these \u201ctrue\u201d links to inform the decisions one needs to make when using traditional linking methods.  Second, we use the links to construct a training data set for use in supervised machine learning methods.  We describe the procedure we use and illustrate the potential of our approach by linking individuals across the 100% samples of the US decennial censuses from 1900, 1910, and 1920.  We obtain an overall match rate of about 70 percent, with a false positive rate of about 12 percent.  This combination of high match rate and accuracy represents a point beyond the current frontier for record linking methods.\n\n",
