1 Introduction
Globalization is an important cause for the increase in economic well being by improving the worldwide allocation of resources and by fostering international competition. Yet
globalization is also reason for concern about the viability of the nation state because increased openness limits the ability to redistribute resources among citizens, it may contribute
to larger income inequality, and openness potentially exposes people to higher volatile incomes.1 This tension becomes quite clear when governments compete for foreign investment
by o¤ering tax breaks or outright subsidies to global corporations in order to increase local
employment, boost domestic wages and generate technological spillovers. The …nancing of
these location incentives typically requires less spending on other government services or a
shift of tax burden to immobile factors. Thus, there is a potential con‡ict of interest between
citizens who di¤er in preferences for government services or sources of income.
The present paper models the political con‡ict and develops a theory of voter backlash
when a region needs to o¤er a subsidy to attract a global corporation that generates additional income in the host region. A backlash is said to occur if the region is initially willing to
pay a subsidy to the corporation, but stops paying the subsidy in a later period and therefore
the corporation exits. The perhaps surprising feature of the model is that the policy reversal
can occur even if the corporation generates the same gross bene…t for all citizens and the
bene…t is larger than the per capita subsidy necessary to attract or keep the corporation. To
understand this result it is useful to explain …rst the nature of the political con‡ict in any
given period. There is disagreement over the value of the presence of the corporation because
the after-tax bene…t of the corporation’s presence is tied to an individual’s preference for
redistributive taxation. When the bene…t of the corporation is the same for all individuals,
it is the ”middle class” who supports the presence of the …rm because a middle-class person
prefers zero or small tax rates for redistributional purposes and hence makes the after-tax
bene…t from the coporation identical (or very similar) to the gross bene…t. Individuals who
favor a strongly progressive or regressive income tax in the absence of the corporation, …nd
that attracting the corporation is too costly in terms of forgone redistribution.
Yet the outcome of the political con‡ict may change over time. The policy choice and
the identity of the elected policy maker is a¤ected by economic disturbances because a shock
1

See Rodrik (1997) for an analysis of these aspects of globalization.

1

to the host region leaves the …rm’s outside option una¤ected. The shock in turn changes
how individuals evaluate the trade-o¤ between the net bene…ts of having the corporation
present and the forgone redistribution. The economic shock may originate inside or outside
the host region. For example, the decline of an existing industry due to a world price shock
decreases individual earnings and a¤ects the political outcome. An important contribution
of the paper is to show that the exact e¤ects of a shock depend on (i) the distribution of gross
bene…ts from the corporation’s presence and (ii) which host region variables are a¤ected by
the shock.
In particular, I show that a negative shock to all host variables reduces the number
of supporters of the corporation (if they were elected policymaker), increases both an opponent’s incentive to become a candidate (holding the winning probability constant) and
the opponent’s probability of winning the election against a proponent (holding the set of
candidates …xed). Yet the …rst of these results is reversed if the shock a¤ects all host variables except the bene…t from the corporation. The robustness of these and other results
are checked by considering also the case in which the distribution of gross bene…ts from
the corporation are proportional to the exogenously given individual income rather than
independent of individual earnings.
The voter backlash hypothesis o¤ers a novel explanation for the reversal of host government decisions. Host governments frequently display two types of behavior toward outside
investors. Initially they eagerly compete for the …rm by o¤ering subsidies or tax breaks and
then, after the …rm has made its location choice, reverse their policy decision. This often
leads to the exit of the corporation from the host region. The traditional explanation for
the phenomenon is that after the …rm is locked in, the bargaining power shifts from the
…rm to the host government.2 This argument is well understood and empirically relevant,
but it is also in an important sense incomplete because there are other reasons for policy
reversals. I will discuss anecdotal evidence for the voter backlash hypothesis and related
empirical studies in section 6.
The main result of the paper can be interpreted in a di¤erent way. Instead of looking
at the political outcome in one particular host region over time, the model predicts that
2

See, for example, Bond and Samuelson (1989) and Doyle and van Wijnbergen (1994), who discuss …rm
investment strategies and optimal taxes.

2

in a cross-sectional analysis countries with less skewed distributions of earnings are more
likely to attract foreign investment. The result holds if income inequality is measured by
the gap between mean and median income, and if the median voter is always elected policy
maker. When mean and median income are closely aligned, the median income person favors
little or no redistributive taxation in the absence of the corporation and thus also favors the
presence of the corporation as long as the gross bene…t of the corporation exceeds the subsidy
payment. Yet even if median income equals mean income, the …rm may be rejected. I show
that under some conditions an equilibrium exists in which two opponents of the …rm run for
o¢ce and win with probability one half.
While the interpretation of the model is cast in the context of foreign investment by
multinational …rms, it should be pointed out that the theory of voter backlash developed in
this paper has more general appeal and potential for wider applications. For example, citizens
in a closed economy may consider adopting a project that generates additional income for
all citizens (not necessarily the same). If the costs of the project are una¤ected by random
events - or not a¤ected in the same way as the bene…ts of the project and other variables
- a voter backlash can occur. In the following I use the foreign investment interpretation
because policy reversals are quite common in this context.
The modeling of the political process is based on the citizen-candidate model that was
developed by Osborne and Slivinski (1996) and Besley and Coate (1997). In a citizencandidate model each citizen can become a candidate for o¢ce and the winner of the election
implements her most preferred policy. Running for o¢ce entails paying a cost, e.g., costs for
campaigning, which prevents all citizens from becoming candidates. The advantage of this
framework for the present purpose is twofold. It allows me to pin down the identity of the
policy maker and hence the idea of a voter backlash can be captured in a meaningful sense.
Secondly, the citizen-candidate model can handle the multi-dimensional policy space easily
because ctizens vote for candidates and not directly for policies.
The present paper shares similarities and a common interest in understanding policy
choice with Besley and Coate (1998). Yet the two papers also di¤er and complement each
other. Besley and Coate analyze in a closed-economy the e¢ciency e¤ects of political decision making in a dynamic context. The elected policy maker in period 1 decides whether the
government undertakes a costly investment that generates bene…ts for some citizens in the
3

next period. The investment may not be undertaken if today’s policy maker cannot ensure
that potential losers are compensated in the future or if it harms the present policy maker
in the future because the identity of the policy maker changes as a result of the investment.
By contrast, the present paper assumes that costs and bene…ts of the project occur simultaneously and repeatedly, and the gross bene…ts are shared equally by all citizens. There is
nevertheless political con‡ict because the evaluation of the project is tied to the preference
for redistribution.
The idea in this paper complements and is in contrast to Coate and Morris (1999) who
develop a theory of policy persistence. They correctly observe that ine¢cient policies are
often maintained over time, like support for farmers who have become wealthy, or protection
for import-competing industries long after the strategy is considered useful. Coate and
Morris show within a lobbying framework following Grossman and Helpman (1994) that the
implementation of a policy in the current period increases the likelihood of continuation of
that policy in the future. By contrast, this paper argues that there are policy areas, like the
tax treatment of inward foreign direct investment, where policy reversals frequently occur.
Yet even in the present framework policy is likely to be persistent if the underlying economic
conditions do not change.
The idea of a political backlash is discussed in Laban and Wolf (1993). In the context
of large-scale privatization in transition economies, they point out that the private return of
buying a privatized …rm depends on the likelihood of the continuation of a market-friendly
policy, which in turn depends on the aggregate amount of privatization. There is the possibility of a political backlash if the aggregate amount of privatization does not reach a critical
mass e¤ect. A related point is made by Rodrik (1991) who argues that the likelihood of a
policy reform being sustainable depends on the response of private investment to the reform.
The paper is organized as follows: The next section introduces the model. Section 3
contains the main results under a uniform structure of bene…ts from the corporation. The
case of proportional bene…ts is analyzed in section 4. Section 5 illustrates the working of
the model by way of examples. Section 6 considers anecdotal evidence and discusses the
results of the paper in the context of empirical studies on the factors explaining foreign
direct investment. Section 7 concludes and discusses possible extensions.

2 The Model
Overview
I begin with an overview of the main features of the model which are then described in
more detail below. Consider a region whose individuals live for two periods. Individuals di¤er
in terms of income and therefore there is political con‡ict over public policy. In each period
individuals must elect a person who decides on a proportional income tax rate, a uniform
lump sum subsidy, and whether a corporation is attracted or kept. In the base version of the
model I assume that the …rm can be attracted in period 2 even when it was not present in
the region in period 1. If present in any period, the corporation generates additional income
for all individuals. For the …rm to be attracted in any period, the government needs to pay
a subsidy to the …rm that must be …nanced through distortionary taxation.
The two periods di¤er in one important respect. At the beginning of period 2 the region
experiences a region-speci…c, proportional shock. The key objective of the analysis is to
characterize conditions under which the …rm is attracted in period 1, but voters decide in
period 2 not to pay the subsidy necessary to keep the …rm in the region. If this happens, the
region reverses its earlier decision and I call this a voter backlash. The focus of the model is
on the region’s internal decision making and not on the corporation. The …rm always gets
the value of its outside option regardless of whether the …rm produces in the region or not.
Model Description
I now turn to the detailed description of the model. The region is inhabited by a …nite
number of individuals N; indexed by superscript i = 1; :::; N; who in each period t (subscript
t = 1; 2) derive utility from net income wti: For simplicity I assume that N is odd. Preferences
are assumed to be identical for all individuals. Let the utility of individual i be
u(w i1; wi2) = f (wi1) + h(wi2);

(1)

where the functions f and h are increasing. Net income in period t; w t; consists of four sources
(I omit index i if no confusion is possible). First, there is a person-speci…c and exogenously
given income component yt ; called private income. Di¤erences in private income may be the
result of di¤erences in skills or di¤erences in the mix of labor and capital income. Denote the
lowest and highest income yt and y t. Average private income in period t is Y t = N ¡1
5

P

i
i yt :

The second source of income is obtained if the region attracts the global corporation. In
that case citizen i receives mit ¸ 0. Call this extra income. I consider two cases. In the
…rst case extra income is uniform across all individuals in any given period, i.e. mit = mt

for all i. In the second case extra income is assumed to be proportional to private income,
mit = kyti, for k > 0: The choice of these two cases is partly driven by analytical aspects.
Both cases are fairly easy to solve and allow me to check the robustness of results. Extra
income may stand for a variety of bene…ts that are directly or indirectly generated by the
corporation: an increase in the region’s wage rate as a result of an increase in labor demand,
a reduction in unemployment in the presence of a …xed wage, technological spillovers to other
business, agglomeration bene…ts, etc. Note that if mt is uniform, mt=yt is falling in private
income. Thus the bene…ts of the corporation are concentrated at the lower end of the income
distribution. This seems to be a reasonable feature, in particular when multinationals set up
assembly plants that tend be intensive in low- to medium-skilled workers. The uniformity
assumption does not imply, however, that low-income individuals always prefer attracting
the …rm, as will be shown later.
Third, in each period the government makes a uniform lump sum payment gt to all
individuals. Revenues for this payment come from taxing private and extra incomes. I allow
for the possibility that the transfer is a tax, i.e., g t < 0:
Finally, if an individual becomes a candidate for o¢ce, she must pay the cost of candidacy
ct ¸ 0 which may re‡ect campaign cost or the cost associated with being in the public eye.
If the person is not a candidate, this component is zero.

Since the region may decide not to attract the corporation, we can write individual income
in period t as
wit = (1 ¡ ¿ t)(yti + ± t mit ) + g t ¡ "it ct

(2)

where ±t and "t are indicator variables. The variable ± t takes the value of one when the …rm
is present in period t, and ±t = 0 if not. If an individual is a candidate in period t; then
"t = 1 and zero otherwise. The proportional income tax rate in period t is ¿ t : Note that
extra income is considered taxable income.
To attract or keep the corporation, the government of the region must pay a subsidy S to
the corporation in that period (but the same in all periods). The government raises revenues
6

through a proportional income tax ¿ t which is levied on yt and mt (if the corporation is
present in that period) to pay for the subsidy to the corporation and the lump sum payment
gt to all individuals. I assume, however, that there is a government ine¢ciency, similar to
Perotti (1993). Each tax dollar raised allows spending of only 1 ¡ ¿ dollars. 3 This gives
rise to a quadratic revenue function in ¿ and makes the model tractable. The government
budget constraint in per capita terms for period t is then
(3)

¿ t (1 ¡ ¿ t )(Yt + ± tmt ) = gt + ± ts;
where s = SN ¡1 is the per capita subsidy to the corporation and mt = N ¡1
extra income. In the uniform case mt =

mit

P

i
i mt

is average

= mt for all i: I allow for the possibility that ¿

is negative and hence the uniform lump sum subsidy g becomes a lump sum tax. This case
is still consistent with the loss function that describes the government ine¢ciency. For every
dollar raised in revenues through g, the government can subsidize private income only at the
rate 1=¿ (1 ¡ ¿ ) < 0 which is less in absolute value than the rate 1=¿ under no government
ine¢ciency.

The situation in the two periods is the same except for a region-speci…c shock at the
beginning of period 2 that leaves the …rm’s outside option una¤ected. An example may
illustrate: The region experiences unemployment due to an above-equilibrium …xed wage.
Suppose there is a shock to the region’s other industries or a shock to labor supply. The
global corporation is una¤ected by the shock if, as is assumed, the shock has no impact on
the …xed wage and the productivity of the corporation. Thus the region has to continue
to pay S to the corporation.4 The shock a¤ects private incomes and the cost of candidacy,
but may or may not a¤ect extra incomes. I consider both possibilities to show that results
depend on the particular shock structure.
Suppose ¸ 2 (0; 1) is a random variable. Private incomes in period 1 and 2 are then

related as follows. Each individual’s period 2 private income is proportional to period 1’s
income,
y2i = ¸y1i ;
3 Alternatively,

(4)

allowing for variable labor supply would endogenize private (labor) income and introduce
a tax distortion with similar e¤ects.
4
I abstract from the improved bargaining power of the corporation as a result of the increased value of
the corporation for the region as a whole.

7

Thus Y2 = ¸Y1; y2 = ¸y 1 and y2 = ¸y1 : In situation 1, the shock a¤ects also extra income
mi2 = ¸mi1:

(5)

In this case equations (4) and (5) imply that the ratio of extra income and private income
is the same in both periods. Situation 1 can be interpreted in the unemployment context:
If a region experiences a sudden in‡ow of workers, more workers are seeking employment
with the global corporation and with other employers. This lowers in expected terms private
incomes and the bene…t per worker from the corporation.
Alternatively, the shock leaves extra incomes una¤ected (situation 2)
mi2 = mi1:

(6)

Finally, I assume that ct is a¤ected by the shock as well, i.e.,
c2 = ¸c1:

(7)

This assumption is made to show how in situation 1 a shock that proportionally a¤ects all
host region variables changes the political equilibrium. The case c2 = c1 will be considered
as well, though without much a¤ecting results.
The decisionmaking in this model follows the citizen-candidate literature: In each period,
individuals must elect someone who chooses the tax rate ¿ , the lump sum payment g, and
who decides whether the …rm is attracted (or kept) or not, i.e., chooses ± = 1 or ± = 0:
Citizens vote for one person from the set of self-declared candidates. The person with the
highest number of votes wins (plurality rule). In case of ties, each tying person wins with
equal probability. In their voting decision, each citizen maximizes her expected utility (where
the randomness comes from the possibilities of ties in an election). If elected, an individual
can implement his or her most preferred policy in that period. In each period each individual
must decide whether to become a candidate or not. In doing so, she takes the entry decisions
of all other individuals as given and correctly anticipates the voting decision of all citizens
and the preferred policy implemented by the winner. The set of entry decisions must form
a Nash equilibrium (possibly in mixed strategies). If no individual becomes a candidate in
period t, I assume that the default policy is ¿ t = gt = ±t = 0:
8

Solving for the equilibrium of the two period economy is simpli…ed because the …rm can
be attracted in period 2 even if absent in period 1. In this case the two periods can be
analyzed separately. The decision in period 1 does not change the set of feasible policies
or the political process in period 2. There are no irreversibilities in the …rm’s investment
decision and there is no incumbent advantage in period 2 for the individual who was elected
in period 1. I will return to these assumptions in the concluding section.
The second observation is that in each period an equilibrium for the political game exists
despite the multidimensional policy space. The reason for this is that the political contest
is a …nite game. A …nite number of players choose from a …nite set of alternatives (become
a candidate or not). Hence, Nash’s Theorem can be applied.
Before we proceed, it is useful to recall the various scenarios. Extra income may be
proportional to or independent of private income. The shock at the beginning of period 2
may or may not a¤ect extra income. This gives four possible scenarios. I consider …rst the
case of uniform extra income under the two shock structures. In section 4 the proportional
case is analyzed.
3 Extra Income is Uniform
I solve the model in three steps. First, I characterize the most preferred policy of an
individual with private income yt : This allows me to explain why there is political con‡ict
over the presence of the …rm even if extra income is the same for all individuals. In a second
step I identify an equilibrium of the political game in period t with one or two candidates: In
the last step I demonstrate the possibility of a voter backlash by showing how the number of
supporters of the …rm, the incentive to becoming a candidate, and the probability of winning
change when shocks occur at the beginning of period 2.
The Most Preferred Policy
As a …rst step to solving the model I characterize each individual’s most preferred policy
in period t if the individual was elected policy maker. An individual maximizes wt by
choosing ¿ t , gt and ±t : The problem is complicated by the fact that ± is a zero-one variable
and that all individuals must have nonnegative income in each period, i.e. wit ¸ 0 for all i.
When extra income is uniform, it is useful to de…ne two threshold levels of private income

Proof: See Appendix
Remark 1: The assumptions y t · 2y t + Yt ensures that the most preferred policies can

be easily characterized because the constraint wti ¸ 0 is never binding. In this sense the
assumption is made for convenience. In an example in a later section I will consider a
situation in which the assumption is violated and the need to determine the most preferred
policy when the constraint is binding arises.
Proposition 1 may seem surprising at …rst glance. Why is anybody against the corporation even when mt > s; in particular when the person has above average income? To answer
this question it is useful to recall the standard result known from Meltzer and Richard (1981)
for a closed economy. Individuals’ most preferred tax rates are ordered inversely by income.
The higher is personal income, the lower is the most preferred tax rate. Individuals with below average income choose a positive tax rate and a lump sum transfer in order to implement
a progressive tax system (measured by the change in the average tax rate (¿ y ¡ g)=y): By
contrast, rich individuals with above average income choose a labor subsidy that is …nanced

by a lump sum tax, thereby making the tax system regressive.5 Average income individuals
choose zero taxes and transfers.
5 This

assumes that the poorest person has strictly positive income. Otherwise the tax rate and the lump
sum transfer are constrained to be nonnegative. Meltzer and Richard make that assumption.

Consider now the possibility of attracting the corporation. For some given tax rate ¿ ,
an individual’s income changes as follows: The …rst e¤ect is an increase in net income by
(1 ¡ ¿ )m: In addition, the government lump sum subsidy g changes by ¿ (1 ¡ ¿)m ¡s: Hence

the change of net income at a given tax rate is the combined e¤ect and equals (1 ¡ ¿ 2 )m ¡s:
Assuming m > s; the term is positive when the tax rate is su¢ciently close to zero, but
negative otherwise. In other words, the optimal tax rate that maximizes the net bene…t
from the corporation is zero.
Relatively poor and relatively rich individuals therefore face a tradeo¤ between the two
objectives, redistribution of income and maximizing the net bene…t of the corporation’s
presences. This explains why individuals whose incomes are far apart from the average
income (i.e., outside the interval [y1¤; y¤¤
1 ]) are against the corporation because their most
preferred tax rate for redistributional purposes is large in absolute terms. In particular, a
very rich individual likes to subsidize labor income in the absence of the …rm.
Proposition is illustrated in Figure 1, which plots the preferred tax rate, lump sum
payment and the ±¡variable as a function of private income.
In the remainder of the paper, I will assume that m1 > s and the set [y1¤; y¤¤
1 ] is a strict
subset of the set [y1 ; y1] so that some but not all people favor the corporation in period 1.
A Characterization of the Political Equilibrium in Period t
Which individual will be elected to implement her most preferred policy? The following
result establishes a simple condition under which the person with median income y m becomes
the elected policymaker. Under additional assumptions, I also demonstrate the existence of
an equilibrium with two candidates who enter and win with probability one half. Further
equilibria may exist. The purpose is not to provide a full characterization of all equilibria,
but rather to show the properties of some intuitive and simple equilibria.
Proposition 2 Assume the cost of running for o¢ce are su¢ciently small.
a) The following is an equilibrium of the political game in period t: The person with
median income runs uncontested and becomes elected policymaker. In this equilibrium,
the …rm is not attracted (or kept) if the distribution of private incomes is too skewed,
11

i.e., for given average private income Yt 2 [yt¤; y¤¤
t ] the median income lies either below
y¤t or above y¤¤
t :

b) Suppose the distribution of private incomes is single-peaked, symmetric around average income, less than one third of the population has private income between yt¤ and
¤
¤¤
y¤¤
t ; and the two threshold levels satisfy y t < y t < y t < y t : Then there exists an equi-

librium with two candidates whose incomes are yt1 = yt¤ ¡ ® and yt2 = yt¤¤ + ®, where
® is a small positive number. In this equilibrium the …rm is rejected.

Proof: a) Consider …rst the condition of entry for the median income person. If the person
does not enter, the default policy is ¿ t = g t = ± t = 0 and the person’s utility is ytm: If elected,
the person with median income has utility (Y t + ytm )2=4Yt ¡ ct when the person’s optimal
policy is ±t = 0: The median person enters if ct = 0 and by continuity enters also if ct is
positive but su¢ciently small. The same type of argument applies when the median person
prefers ±t = 1: This guarantees entry of the median income person.
Consider next entry of another candidate who runs against the median income person.
Nobody with the same income as the median income person enters because policy is unaffected but running for o¢ce is costly. Suppose then somebody with income yb 6= ytm enters.
This person would surely lose the election. To see this, …nd the person who is indi¤erent

between the two candidates. That person’s private income ye must lie between the two candidates’ incomes for the following reason. A person with income su¢ciently close to the entrant

prefers strictly the entrant, while a person with income su¢ciently close to the median income prefers the median income individual. By continuity then, there must exist an income
level in between such that this person would be indi¤erent. Note also that all individuals
with incomes y < ye prefer the entrant (median income person) if yb < ym (yb > ym ); while
all individuals with incomes y > ye prefer the median income person (entrant) if yb > ym

(yb < ym): Hence, the median income person gets more than half of the votes. The second
part of statement a) follows now immediately from Proposition 1.

Statement b) holds because the symmetry of the candidates’ position around average
income and the properties of the distribution of private incomes implies that each candidate
receives half of the votes and hence wins with probability one half. Entry is optimal for
each candidate if the cost of running are zero (or by continuity su¢ciently small). No other
12

citizen has an incentive to enter because she would surely lose. In particular no person with
income between the candidates enters because she could get no more than one third of the
vote which is less than the two other candidates get. The …rm is rejected since the two
candidates’ incomes are outside the supporting interval. Q.E.D.
The intuition for the …rst part of Proposition 2 is straightforward. The support for the
corporation, as described in Proposition 1, depends only on average income, extra income
and the subsidy paid, but not on median income. Thus the median income person, if elected,
may not want to attract or keep the …rm if the person’s income is much lower (or higher) than
average income. This result has an interesting corollary if economies with identical average
income but di¤erent median income are compared. Consider a global corporation that can
invest in either of two economies that have the same average private income Y; but di¤er in
their median incomes ymi such that either ym1 < y ¤ < ym2 < y¤¤ or y¤ < y m2 < y¤¤ < ym1 :
The following corollary is then straightforward.
Corollary Economies with less skewed income distributions are more likely to attract outside
investment if the median income person is always elected policy maker.
Proposition 2a and the Corollary suggest that too much skewness in the distribution
of private incomes is detrimental to attracting the …rm or foreign investment in general.
Proposition 2b, however, shows that a large skewness in the distribution of private incomes
is not necessary for a rejection of the …rm. Even when average and median income are
perfectly lined up, as in Proposition 2b, the elected policy maker may not want to attract
the …rm. This happens if two opponents of the …rm, but with di¤erent redistributional
objectives, enter the political race and win with probability one half.
The Voter Backlash
I now turn to the e¤ects of shocks on the political outcome in period 2. Formally, I
analyze how the critical income values (y¤t ; yt¤¤ ) or the income value of a particular voter
changes continuously with the shock variable ¸: Of course, the shock may have no e¤ect at
all because I assumed that the number of individuals is …nite and hence a small change in say
y¤ may not switch anybody’s vote or preference. The following results should therefore be
interpreted for economies in which the distance between any two neighboring income levels
is very small relative to the magnitude of the shock.
13

Proposition 3 Consider at the beginning of period 2 a small negative (positive) shock ¸ <
1(¸ > 1): Assume that the p.d.f. of private incomes is constant up to some level y > y¤¤:
a) If the shock a¤ects private income, extra income and cost of candidacy ( y, m and c)
it reduces (increases) the number of people who support the corporation compared to
period 1 if either y¤1 > y1 or y1¤¤ < y1;
b) If the shock a¤ects only private income and cost of candidacy, but not extra income,
it increases (decreases) the number of people who support the corporation compared to
period 1 if either y¤1 > y1 or y1¤¤ < y1;
Proof: a) The critical private income values in period 2 are
y2¤

q

(10)

q

(11)

= ¸[Y1 ¡ 2 Y1 (Y1 + m1)(1 ¡ s(¸m1)¡1)]

y¤¤
= ¸[Y1 + 2 Y1(Y1 + m1)(1 ¡ s(¸m1)¡1)]:
2

Since all incomes are a¤ected by the shock, more people at the lower end will support the
…rm if F2(y¤2 ) < F1(y¤1 ); where Ft is the cumulative density function over private incomes
in period t. Note that these functions typically di¤er across periods because a proportional
shock a¤ects the location and size of the domain. When p.d.f. of private incomes is constant
in the relevant range, support increases at the lower end if
y2¤ ¡ ¸y1
y1¤ ¡ y1
<
:
¸(y1 ¡ y1)
y1 ¡ y1
This is equivalent to

y2¤
¸

(12)

< y¤1 ; which after inserting for the critical values and simplifying

holds for ¸ > 1: Hence the support for the corporation is reduced at the lower end of the
income distribution when a negative shock occurs.
Similarly, a shock increases the support at the ”upper end” if
¸y1 ¡ y¤¤
y ¡ y1¤¤
2
< 1
;
¸(y1 ¡ y1)
y1 ¡ y1

(13)

which is equivalent to y1¤¤ < y¤¤
2 =¸: This holds for a positive shock ¸ > 1; but is reversed for
negative shocks.
14

b) The di¤erent shock structure a¤ects the critical private income values y ¤ and y¤¤ in
a di¤erent way. In fact, the shock now has the opposite e¤ects. To see this, note that the
lower critical value in period 2 now becomes
·

¸

q

y2¤ = ¸ Y1 ¡ 2 Y1(Y1 + m¸¡1 )(1 ¡ sm¡1)

(14)

and similarly for y2¤¤ : Compared to (12), y¤2 =¸ is now increasing instead of decreasing in ¸:
Q.E.D.
Remark 2: The assumption that the p.d.f. is constant up to some upper threshold level
allows me to make a comparison between the number of voters who have incomes less than
lower critical values y1¤ and y2¤: The results could be overturned for di¤erent p.d.f. The
reason for the upper threshold level y < y is that for a constant p.d.f. over the entire
interval of incomes median income would equal mean income, an assumption that is usually
contradicted empirically.
The intuition for part a) is as follows. Recall that for a given tax rate ¿, the net bene…t
of the corporation is (1 ¡ ¿ 2)m ¡ s: A negative shock that lowers extra income works in the
direction of making the presence of the corporation less attractive. The region has to spend

the same amount of resources to attract the corporation but the bene…t decreases. At the
margin this makes voters more inclined to use the tax system to redistribute income instead
of attracting the corporation.
The opposite holds when the shock does not a¤ect extra income. In this case the bene…t
and the cost of attracting the corporation stay the same, but the bene…t increases relative
to the gains from redistribution because the private income tax base has declined. This can
be also seen by considering someone with below average income. The optimal tax rate in
the presence of the …rm ¿ = (Y ¡ y)=2(Y + m) now falls when a negative shock to private
incomes only occurs. Thus a negative shock increases support for the corporation at the
lower end of the income distribution.
The next result deals with the incentive of an opponent to become a candidate against a
proponent of the …rm. Regardless of the structure of shocks, a negative shock makes entry
more attractive.

15

Proposition 4 In period 1 a proponent of the …rm is a candidate and an opponent of the
…rm is indi¤erent between entering and staying out of the race.
a) A negative shock in period 2 to all host variables leads the opponent to strictly prefer
entry over no entry, holding the probability of winning constant. A positive shock has
the opposite e¤ect.
b) The result continues to hold if the shock does not a¤ect the cost of candidacy, i.e.
c2 = c1; and the cost of candidacy is su¢ciently small relative to the subsidy, i.e.
s > 2c1:
c) Suppose the proponent’s income equals average income and the shock a¤ects private
incomes and cost of candidacy, but not extra incomes. In contrast to part a, a positive
shock leads the opponent to strictly prefer entry over no entry, holding the probability
of winning constant.
Proof : a) Consider two candidates: the …rst has income y1p 2 [y1¤; y¤¤
1 ] and is a proponent

of the …rm in period 1, and the second has income y1o < y1¤ and is an opponent to the …rm.
In period 1 the opponent is indi¤erent between becoming a candidate and not becoming a
candidate. This must imply that the two candidates win with probability one half. Therefore,
for the opponent
0:5[(1 ¡ ¿ o1 )y1o + g o1 ] + 0:5[(1 ¡ ¿ p1 )(y1o + m1) + g1p] ¡ c1 = (1 ¡ ¿ p1)(yo1 + m1 ) + g1p;
where the left hand side is the expected utility when the person becomes a candidate and the
right hand side re‡ects the utility when the person is not entering the political race. This
condition is equivalent to
[(1 ¡ ¿ o1 )y1o + g o1] ¡ 2c1 = (1 ¡ ¿ p1)(y1o + m1) + g p1 :

(15)

A shock ¸ that a¤ects all host country variables and that is consistent with y2o < y¤2 < y2p
has the following e¤ects on the preferred policies of the two candidates: The tax rates in
period 2 are the same as in period 1 (by Proposition 1). The optimal lump sum subsidy
of the opponent becomes g o2 = ¸g o1; while for the proponent it is g2p = ¸(g1p + s) ¡ s: The
16

opponent’s di¤erence in expected utility from becoming a candidate and not becoming a
candidate in period 2 is
¸
f[(1 ¡ ¿ o1)yo1 + g1o] ¡ [(1 ¡ ¿ p1)(y1o + m1) + g p1 + s(1 ¡ ¸¡1 )]g ¡ c2
2
Using (15) to replace the …rst square bracket, we can simplify the condition to
s
¸c1 ¡ c2 + (1 ¡ ¸):
2

(16)

Expression (16) is positive under a negative shock if c2 = ¸c1 (i.e., the shock a¤ects the cost
of candidacy). Becoming a candidate is strictly preferred over not becoming a candidate
if ¸ < 1 and vice versa if ¸ > 1: The expression is also positive under a negative shock if
c2 = c1 (i.e., the shock does not a¤ect the cost of candidacy) and s > 2c1 : This proves part
b.
c) When y1P = Y1 and extra income is una¤ected; the algebra simpli…es dramatically
because yP2 = Y2; ¿ P1 = ¿ P2 = 0; and g1P = g2P = ¡s: Using (15) in the same way as above,
the di¤erence in expected utitity from entry and no entry equals
(m1 ¡ s)(¸ ¡ 1)
+ ¸c1 ¡ c2:
2

(17)

This is positive under a positive shock regardless how candidacy costs are a¤ected (recall
that m1 > s is necessary for anybody to support the …rm). Q.E.D.
When the shock a¤ects all host variables, the opponent’s cost of staying out of the race
increase because the proponent still wants to attract the …rm, but the subsidy is unchanged.
This result could be overturned if the shock does not a¤ect the cost of candidacy and the
latter are big enough relative to the per capita subsidy. By contrast, shocks can work in
the opposite direction if not all host variables are a¤ected. In particular, if the proponent’s
income equals average income, her most preferred policy and hence the net bene…t from
attracting the corporation is the same in both periods. Yet, the positive shock increases the
opponent’s bene…t from entering the race because the redistributional gains are higher due
to a larger tax base.
The …nal result in this section deals with the opponent’s chances of winning the election
if the set of candidates is held …xed. The probability of winning depends on how the position
17

of the critical voter, who is indi¤erent between the two candidates, shifts as a result of the
shock.
Proposition 5 Assume the p.d.f. of private incomes is constant up to some level y and the
shock a¤ects all host variables. A negative (positive) shock increases (decreases) an opponentto-the-…rm’s probability of winning against a proponent of the corporation, holding the set of
candidates …xed.

Proof: De…ne ye1 as the person who is indi¤erent between the proponent and the opponent
to the …rm in period 1 when yo1 < y1¤ < y1p and hence ¿ p1 < ¿ o1. All individuals with income

y < ye1 prefer the opponent, while all above prefer the proponent. The private income level
of the indi¤erent person is given by
ye1 =

m[1 ¡ (¿ o1)2] + Y1[¿ p1 (1 ¡ ¿ p1) ¡ ¿ o1(1 ¡ ¿ o1 )] ¡ s
;
¿ p1 ¡ ¿ o1

(18)

and is between the two candidates’ income. After the shock in period 2, the person who is
indi¤erent has private income
ye2 =

¸m[1 ¡ (¿ o1)2] + ¸Y1[¿ p1 (1 ¡ ¿ p1) ¡ ¿ o1(1 ¡ ¿ o1 )] ¡ s
;
¿ p1 ¡ ¿ o1

(19)

since the preferred tax rate of the two candidates is unchanged when a shock a¤ects all host
variables. The opponent to the corporation has now more political support, and hence a
higher probability of winning, if F 1(ye1) < F2 (ye2 ): Under a uniform distribution of incomes
up to some level y ¸ yp; the condition simpli…es to
ye2
:
¸

ye1 <

(20)

This is the case if ¸ < 1 because ¿ p1 ¡ ¿ o1 < 0:

The same logic applies when yo1 > y1¤ > y1p and hence ¿ p1 > ¿ o1: Support for the opponent
increases if ye1 > ye2=¸; which holds when ¸ < 1: Q.E.D.

Under a negative shock both candidates adjust their preferred policy. In fact, tax rates

are unchanged and only the lump sum transfer adjusts. Since the subsidy to the …rm is
una¤ected, the adjustment of the lump sum transfer is less than proportional (to the shock)
18

if the proponent is elected, while the adjustment is proportional when the opponent is in
o¢ce. The person who is indi¤erent between the two candidates in period 1 now favors the
opponent. A similar result cannot be established for the case when the shock does not a¤ect
extra income.
All results in this section are partial in the sense that some variable is held …xed: the
identity of the policy maker, the probability of winning, or the set of candidates. A general
characterization of the comparative statics is analytically di¢cult. While the results suggest
that a shock can lead to a backlash, it is important to have proof that this indeed can happen.
In section 5 I will provide examples in which in equilibrium a backlash occurs. Before this
is done, I consider the case when extra income is proportional to private income.
4 Extra Income Proportional to Private Income
In the previous section it was assumed that the presence of the corporation generates the
same absolute extra income for every individual. This was instructive in order to show that
even then there is political con‡ict. It is important to check the robustness of the previous
results by considering a nonuniform structure of extra incomes. An alternative that is easy
to solve for is the case of proportional extra incomes,
mit = kyti;

(21)

where k > 0 is a parameter. I show that under (21) the thrust of the main results, though
with some modi…cations, stays the same.
Individual income in period t is wit = (1 ¡ ¿ )(1 + ±k)yti + g under public policy f±; ¿ ; gg:

I proceed as in section 3 by characterizing most preferred policies, properties of political
equilibria in any given period t, and the e¤ects of shocks on political outcomes. For the
proportional case it is useful to de…ne another threshold level
µ q

¶

yt¤¤¤ = Yt 2 sm¡1
t ¡1 ;

(22)

where mt = kYt is average extra income. The threshold income level yt¤¤¤ is less than average
income Yt if average extra income mt is greater than the per capita subsidy to the …rm s.
It is shown in the appendix that when yt · 2y t, the most preferred policy by an individual
with income yt is

(24)

otherwise. The corporation is not attracted.
The di¤erence between the uniform and proportional case is that in the former no individual would want to subsidize the …rm if average extra income, and hence everyone’s
extra income, is less than the per capita subsidy. By contrast, in the proportional case, rich
individuals may want to attract the …rm even if average extra income is less than the per
capita subsidy. What matters to an individual is the person’s extra income, not the average. 6
Another di¤erence is that the preferred tax rate structure is the same regardless of the value
of ±:
When it comes to political equilibria, the uniform and the porportional cases are quite
similar: The median income person is elected policymaker if the cost of candidacy are su¢ciently small. It is easy to see that the …rm is not attracted if median income ym is less than
y¤¤¤ : The result parallels Proposition 2a in that the rejection of the …rm is more likely, the
more skewed is the distribution of private incomes because the threshold income level y¤¤¤
depends positively on average income.
Similar results are also obtained when shocks occur at the beginning of period 2. If shocks
a¤ect private and extra incomes, it follows from (22) that the insights from Proposition 3a
are unchanged: A positive shock increases support while a negative shock lowers the number
of people who are in favor of the corporation (i.e., y2¤¤¤ =¸ < y1¤¤¤ if ¸ > 1): By contrast,
when the shock a¤ects only private income, the shock does not change the support for the
¤¤¤
corporation because y¤¤¤
for all ¸ (as can be seen from (22) again): This result
2 =¸ = y 1

di¤ers from the uniform case.
Using the same logic as above, it can also be shown that the results from Propositions
4a,b and 5 hold under proportional extra income. Looking back over the proofs, it becomes
clear that what matters is how the opponent or an indi¤erent voter evaluate entry decisions
and di¤erent policies. The evaluation depends on own private and extra income and not on
the distributional assumptions.
6 Of

course, average extra income matters indirectly through the government budget constraint.

20

5 The Model at Work
The results so far suggest that a voter backlash is possible when a shock occurs. The
previous results, however, do not provide a full equilibrium analysis because either the elected
policymaker, the probability of winning or the set of candidates is held constant. The purpose
of this section is to show by way of examples that backlashes indeed occur in equilibrium. I
focus on the case where the shock a¤ects all host variables and extra income is uniform. The
…rst example illustrates the role of income inequality and the possibility of policy reversals
if the identity of the policy maker is not a¤ected between periods. Example 2 constructs
a case in which the shock changes the set of candidates and leads to a voter backlash with
positive probability. In both examples it is assumed that there is only one individual of each
type.
Example 1
There are three individuals with the following incomes: y1t = 10; y2t = 15; and y3t = 34: For
this economy average income is Yt = 19:667; and the critical income values are yt¤ = 14:836
and y¤¤
t = 24:498; assuming that mt = 10 and s = 9:9: Individual 2 is the median and
would pay the subsidy to the …rm. If instead y3t = 40; individual 2 would no longer support
the …rm since yt¤ = 16:428: For su¢ciently small campaign costs individual 2 is elected
and therefore the support of the corporation depends on the skewness of the distribution of
private incomes.
Assume now that y11 = 10; y12 = 15; y13 = 34 in period 1. In period 2, the region experiences
a shock ¸ = 0:99: Individual 2 has an income of 14:85 in period 2. Nobody supports the
…rm, however, because y¤2 = y2¤¤ = Y2 = 19:47: This is a simple situation of voter backlash, in
which the median voter makes the decision in both periods if campaign costs are su¢ciently
small.
Example 2
In this example the shock in period 2 changes the identity of the policy maker. The
example is constructed in such a way that in period 1 the unique equilibrium has a proponent
of the corporation winning the election. In period 2 the proponent and an opponent enter
and win the election with probability one half. The shock switches the vote of one individual
who in period 1 supports the proponent, but votes for the opponent in period 2.
21

There are four individuals with incomes y11 = 10; y12 = 20; y13 = 28 and y14 = 222 in period
1: Let m1 = 10 and s = 9: This gives an average income of Y1 = 70; and critical income
levels y¤1 = 22:671 and y¤¤
1 = 117:33: The following table characterizes the most prefererred

Table 1 - Most Preferred Policies in Period 1
We can now …nd parameters under which only individual 3 becomes a candidate and wins
the election in period 1. Table 2 provides information on utility levels (columns represent
utility of a particular person, while rows represent the most preferred policy of a particular
individual). If person 3 is the only candidate, entry is optimal for her if c1 · 6:513: If person

2 enters as well, each candidate gets two votes and thus wins with probability one half. Entry
of person 2 is optimal only if costs are su¢ciently low, i.e. c1 · 0:158 (= half the di¤erence
between 28.928 and 28.612): Person 2 does not enter if c1 is larger than this.

We also need to rule out entry of person 1. Suppose person 1 enters against person 3.
Person 2, however, prefers the policy of person 3 (28.612>28.571) and hence person 1 can
never win. Finally, consider the possibility that only person 2 becomes a candidate. For this
not to happen, we need that person 3 should …nd entry against 2 optimal which is the case
when c1 · 0:221:
7

Individual 4’s most preferred policy seems to contradict Proposition 1 because y 41 > y ¤¤ should result in
= 0: The reason for the discrepancy is that the condition y 1 < 2y 1 + Y 1 is violated in this example and
hence the constraint w 11 ¸ 0 is binding. Individual 4’s optimal policy must therefore be derived taking the
constraint into accout. It turns out that individual 4 slightly prefers the presence of the …rm.
±41

22

Hence, if 0:158 < c1 · 0:221 the unique equilibrium is that person 3 wins the election

and supports the …rm.

Consider now a shock at the beginning of period 2, ¸ = 0:98: This results in y21 = 9:8; y22 =
19:6; y23 = 27:44 and y24 = 217:56 in period 2: Because m2 = 9:8 and s = 9; average income is
Y2 = 68:6; and critical income levels are y2¤ = 26:693 and y2¤¤ = 110:51: Note that this leaves
the most preferred ± 0s and ¿ 0 s for individuals 1 to 3 una¤ected, while the most preferred
lump sum subsidy changes to g21 = 16:8; g22 = 15:75; g23 = 6:178 and g 42 = ¡22:544: 8
The shock leads to a di¤erent political outcome in period 2. Table 3 gives utility levels
in period 2.

If person 1 enters against person 3, person 2 votes now for person 1 instead of person 3
(28>27.86). Hence both candidates win with probability one half if entering. In addition,
person 3 …nds entry optimal in that situation if c1 · 0:593 and person 1 enters if c1 · 0:902:
We conclude that when person 3 is the sure winner in period 1, the …rm will be rejected
with positive probability in period 2.
6 Evidence and Discussion
In this section I discuss two types of evidence for the theory spelled out above. There is
anecdotal evidence and there are empirical studies that indirectly shed light on the theory.
The experience of two multinational …rms may illustrate the backlash idea. The automobile maker Ford selected in 1997 the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul as location
for a new production facility after being o¤ered a several hundred million dollar incentive
package. In 1999, a new state government decided to stop making payments to Ford because

A di¤erent logic applies for individual 4 for the same reason as above. The most preferred tax rate is
= ¡0:150:

”the money was needed for public services and wages at a time when the Brazilian economy
was stumbling.”9 Ford decided to …nd another Brazilian state to build its plant.
The second example involves the U.S. energy company Enron who is the biggest foreign
investor in India. In 1993 the state of Maharashtra under the leadership of the Congress
Party invited Enron to build the biggest power plant in India.10 The deal allowed Enron
to charge high electricity rates. The Congress Party is ousted in state elections in 1995 by
the nationalist Hindu Party BJP which campaigned by arguing that the electricity rates are
too high. The new government scrapped the partly built plant. Only after negotiations that
lowered the electricity rates Enron is allowed in 1996 to continue with its project. Yet in
1999 the deal comes under …re in elections again. This time the Congress Party campaigns
against the power plant. 11
There exists no direct test of the voter backlash hypothesis although several studies
have looked at the determinants of foreign direct investment in the context of political risk,
while others have considered the role of income inequality for growth of the economy and
the stability of government. There is also a literature on the relationship between policy
uncertainty and investment.
The evidence on political risk as factor explaining the location of FDI is mixed. Political
risk is itself a composite of factors of which one is sometimes, but not always, the degree
of income inequality. Wheeler and Mody (1992) …nd that political risk is not signi…cant
in explaining the FDI of U.S. …rms. Howell and Chaddick (1994) review three di¤erent
approaches of predicting political risk and …nd that for the Business Environment Risk
Intelligence model wealth inquality has a small negative impact in explaining political risk.
Singh and Jun (1995) show that political risk is a signi…cant determinant of FDI ‡ows for
countries that have historically attracted large amounts of FDI. Lehmann (1999) compares
exporting and FDI as di¤erent modes of entry to foreign markets. He …nds that policy risk

11 Further examples of voter backlashes exists. For instance, Mercedes started building a new plant in
Alabama in 1993 after being o¤ered a huge subsidy package. In 1994 the newly elected governor, who is
elected because of his anti-subsidy platform, renegotiates the package after Alabama is unable to pay the
subsidies. See ”O Governor, won’t you buy me a Mercedes plant? A bidding war’s bite,” The New York
Times, Sept. 1, 1996.

has a negative e¤ect on foreign investment by U.S. multinationals. The policy risk variable
in this study is not directly based on income inequality however.
The role of income inequality has been examined in several studies. Persson and Tabellini
(1994) show theoretically and in a cross-country analysis that income inequality has negative e¤ects on economic growth. Muller (1988) discusses the relationship between income
inequality and the stability of democratic regimes. He shows that for well established democracies income inequality is reduced, but new democratic regimes may have short duration if
income inequality is large.
One emprirical study considers the nexus between policy uncertainty and investment.
Servin (1997) uses a real option approach to show that small policy uncertainty can have
large e¤ects on the timing of irreversible investment and applies this logic to the performance
of African countries.
7 Conclusions
This paper has developed a theory of voter backlash that explains the behavior of host
governments toward outside investors as the result of an internal political con‡ict. Citizens
disagree over the net bene…ts of the presence of a corporation because attracting or keeping the corporation typically involves forgone redistribution. Economic shocks change how
citizens evaluate the trade-o¤ between the bene…ts of having the corporation and forgone
redistribution. A voter backlash can occur when shocks change the number of supporters of
the corporation, the set of candidates in an election, and the probability of winning. While
the paper uses foreign investment as a particularly relevant example for the theory developed,
it is clear that the model can be seen as a theory of voter backlash more generally.
For convenience I assumed that the decision making across periods can be separated.
There are no dynamic links over time, like investment irreversibilities or an incumbent advantage. This is not to say that these dynamic links are unimportant or unrealistic, but
rather it allows me to abstract from those aspects that are fairly well understood and not
central to the argument presented. Introducing an investment irreversibility or an incumbent advantage probably makes a policy reversal less likely. If it is costly for the corporation
to move its production after a location decisions was made, the host region needs to pay a
smaller subsidy in the second period. Similarly, if the policy maker in the …rst period has an
25

incumbent advantage, for example due to lower cost of candidacy in period 2, the incumbent
is less likely to be ousted from o¢ce. In both cases, however, it appears that a voter backlash
is still possible if the economic shock is su¢ciently strong.
From a modeling perspective introducing dynamic links raises an additional problem. For
instance, if the …rm becomes partially immobile after it chose a host region, the …rm may
not enter the region in the …rst place. This would require a more thorough modeling of the
…rm’s strategy and other outside options. In the present framework this was not necessary
because the corporation would always realize the value of its outside option.
A perhaps simple way of introducing dynamics is to assume that the …rm can be attracted
in period 2 only if it was present in period 1. Some implications are straightforward. If the
…rm was present in period 1, the decision problem in period 2 is then the same as described
by Propositions 1 and 2. On the other hand, if the …rm was not present in period 1, we are
in a framework similar to Meltzer and Richard (1981). When making decisions in period 1,
citizens anticipate these outcomes in period 2. In period 1, citizen i maximizes w i1+E(wi2(± 1))
by choosing f¿ 1; g 1; ± 1g:12 Second period expected utility depends on whether ± 1 = 1 or 0:

Most preferred policies can now be derived in a similar way as above. Extending the model
in this direction is left for future research.

12

For simplicity I assume that per-period utility is equal to net income.

Appendix
A. Proof of Proposition 1
Consider …rst the case mt ¸ s: Because in any period, utility is increasing in net income,

an individual’s maximization problem when private income is yit is equivalent to maximizing

(1 ¡ ¿ t )(yti + ± t mt ) + g t by choosing the tax rate, the lump sum subsidy and the indicator
variable subject to the government budget constraint (3) and the constraint (1 ¡ ¿ t )(yt +
± tmt ) + gt ¸ 0: The latter constraint guarantees that the person with lowest private income
has nonnegative income. If this condition holds, all other individuals will have nonnegative
incomes too.
I solve the problem in two steps. Initially I ignore the second constraint and then I will
check that the solution obeys the nonnegativy constraint. Solving the government budget
constraint for the lump sum subsidy and inserting in the objective function reduces the
problem to two choice variables, the tax rate and the indicator variable. Taking the derivative
with respective to the tax rate gives
¿ t (yit ) =

Yt ¡ yti
:
2(Y t + ± t mt )

(25)

Note that the second derivative with respect to the tax rate is negative. Plugging (25)
back into the objective function gives after rearranging
w(yit ; ±t ) =

(Yt + 2±t mt + yti)2
¡ ±t s:
4(Yt + ±t mt)

(26)

The optimal policy is found by comparing utilities levels for ±t = 1 and ±t = 0: After
simplifying and rearranging terms the individual who is indi¤erent between having and not
having the …rm has income that solves
yt2 ¡ 2yt Yt + Yt[4(Yt + mt )sm¡1
t ¡ 3Yt ¡ 4mt ] = 0:
Using the quadratic formula and collecting terms, we …nd the two critical values y¤t and yt¤¤ :
± t = 1 is preferred if yit 2 [y¤t ; yt¤¤ ]: Note that these boundary values may lie outside the
interval of actual private incomes. The optimal tax rate is then found from (25).

Consider next the nonnegativity constraint for the lowest income person. Net income of
this person is nonnegative if under the optimal tax policy chosen by an individual j with
27

income ytj
(Yt + 2±t mt + ytj)(2y t + 2± t mt + Yt ¡ ytj) ¸ 4(Yt + ±t mt)± t s:

(27)

Person j may choose ± t = 0: In that case the second bracket on the left-hand side must
be nonnegative. This is always the case when yt · 2yt + Yt : On the other hand, if the person
chooses ±t = 1 then net incomes are nonnegative if

(Yt + 2mt + yt )(2yt + 2mt + Yt ¡ yt ) ¸ 4(Yt + mt)mt ;

(28)

because the LHS of (28) is decreasing in ytj and the RHS is increasing in s: Rearranging and
collecting terms we …nd that (28) is equivalent to
y 2t ¡ 2yt yt · 2yt (Yt + 2mt ) + Yt2:

(29)

It is easy to see now that (29) always holds if yt · 2yt + Yt : When the highest income

equals 2yt + Yt ; then the inequality holds, and so it does for any value yt < 2yt + Yt because
the LHS of (29) is increasing in yt :
Consider next the case mt < s: In this situation nobody wants to attract the …rm. To
see this, consider an individual with income yt whose most preferred tax rate is ¿ 1t when the
…rm is present. The utility level (ignoring campaign costs) in this situation is
wt (yt ; ±t = 1) = (1 ¡ ¿ 1t )(y + ¿ 1t Y ) + [1 ¡ (¿ 1t )2]mt ¡ s:

(30)

The term [1 ¡ (¿ 1t )2]mt ¡ s is negative under the assumption, and hence the maximized

utility in the presence of the …rm is never higher than in the absence of the …rm because in
the absence of the …rm an individual can choose ¿ t = ¿ 1t and her utility is (1 ¡ ¿ 1t )(y + ¿ 1t Y )
which is higher than (30). Q.E.D.

B. Preferred Policies under Proportional Extra Income
An individual with income yti solves the following problem
max(1 ¡ ¿ )(1 + k±)yit + ¿ (1 ¡ ¿ )(1 + k±)Yt ¡ ±s

(31)

by choosing ¿ and ± 2 f0; 1g: The optimal value of ¿ is independent of ± and is found by
di¤erentiating with respect to the tax rate. Preferred tax rates are proportional to private
28

income, that is, ¿ = (Yt ¡ yt)=2Yt : Inserting this back into (31) gives indirect utility
wti(± t = 1) =

wti(± t = 0) =

(Yt + yti)2 (1 + k)
¡s
4Yt
yti)2

(Yt +
4Yt

(32)

:

The income of the person who is indi¤erent between the two choices is found by equating
the two expressions. This gives a quadratic equation in private income. Using the quadratic
formula the two solutions are
q

ya=b = ¡Yt § 2Yt s=mt :
The negative root always leads to a negative expression, while the solution to the positive
root is called

q

yt¤¤¤ = Yt (2 s=mt ¡ 1):
Net income has to be nonnegative. The conditions for this to hold can be derived in a
similar way as for Proposition 1. Consider the person with lowest private income yt : The
person’s net income is falling in the private income of the decision maker. If the elected
person chooses ± t = 0; the condition Yt + 2yt ¸ yt is su¢cient for making net income

nonnegative. If, on the other hand, the choice is ± t = 1, net income of the lowest person is
always nonnegative if yt · 2yt : The latter constraint is the binding one.
