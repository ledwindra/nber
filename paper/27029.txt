ABSTRACT
Over the last two decades, there has been a surge of opioid-related overdose deaths resulting in a
myriad of state policy responses. Researchers have evaluated the effectiveness of such policies
using a wide-range of statistical models, each of which requires multiple design choices that can
influence the accuracy and precision of the estimated policy effects. This simulation study used
real-world data to compare model performance across a range of important statistical constructs
to better understand which methods are appropriate for measuring the impacts of state-level
opioid policies on opioid-related mortality. Our findings show that many commonly-used
methods have very low statistical power to detect a significant policy effect (< 10%) when the
policy effect size is small yet impactful (e.g., 5% reduction in opioid mortality). Many methods
yielded high rates of Type I error, raising concerns of spurious conclusions about policy
effectiveness. Finally, model performance was reduced when policy effectiveness had
incremental, rather than instantaneous, onset. These findings highlight the limitations of existing
statistical methods under scenarios that are likely to affect real-world policy studies. Given the
necessity of identifying and implementing effective opioid-related policies, researchers and
policymakers should be mindful of evaluation study statistical design.

1. INTRODUCTION
In 2017, over 47,000 Americans died from opioid overdoses, a rate of more than 130 fatalities per
day (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2018). In response, states have adopted a myriad of
policies and initiatives to curtail the crisis, including those designed to decrease opioid analgesic use,
increase access to effective treatment for opioid use disorder, and increase utilization of naloxone, an
overdose reversal medication (Mauri, Townsend, and Haffajee 2019, Haegerich et al. 2019). As states
sought to make timely policy decisions in the face of limited resources, opioid-policy researchers
evaluated the effectiveness of implemented policies using a range of statistical and econometric
models.
Studies using these methods often inform policymakers’ decisions, but to date, there have been no
comprehensive examinations of the relative performance of these methods across settings realistic for
state policy evaluation, although various reviews of policy evaluations have been done (Schuler Under
review , Mauri, Townsend, and Haffajee 2019, Haegerich et al. 2019). A recent review of the opioidpolicy literature suggests that approximately 75% of opioid policy evaluation studies using longitudinal
data estimate a policy’s effectiveness using comparative case study approaches (commonly referred to as
difference-in-difference [DID], comparative interrupted time series [CITS], group panel data, or event studies;
(Schuler Under review )). Longitudinal data implies data where one has repeated measures of the outcomes
of interest, measured at an aggregate geographic area (e.g., states) with some “exposed” (treated) and
“unexposed” (control) locations, where the exposed locations may implement the policy of interest at
different times. We assumed state-level implementation (so maximum N=50) and annual measurement of
outcomes. While some publications provide guidance on how best to handle policy evaluations using
longitudinal data (Basu, Meghani, and Siddiqi 2017, O'Neill et al. 2016, Wing, Simon, and Bello-Gomez
2018, Abadie and Cattaneo 2018, Blundell and Costa Dias 2009), methodological best practices have

not been fully adopted by applied opioid policy researchers, and there may be unique considerations in
the opioid context that influence practice guidelines.
There are numerous aspects to a study design examining the impact of opioid policies on mortality
(or other outcomes) that can influence the accuracy and precision of estimates generated, including:
very low outcome occurrence rate (mortality), sample size (both in terms of number of treated states
when evaluating a particular opioid policy as well as longitudinal time points), differences across states
prior to opioid policy adoption, and specification of regression models (including accounting for
repeated measures and assumptions regarding timing of the policy effect). Each choice influences how
well the study can estimate the policy effect both in terms of accuracy (e.g., how close to the truth the
estimated policy effect is) and statistical precision (e.g., the width of the resulting confidence intervals).
The urgency of the opioid crisis necessitates that researchers and policymakers bring accurate, robust
statistical methods to bear on identifying and implementing effective state policies; to our knowledge,
the influence of each of these data elements and design choices on statistical performance of a
particular model is not well-known within the context of opioid-policy evaluations.
There are a growing number of studies highlighting challenges and limitations to using DID models,
particularly when the key assumptions of the DID model do not hold (Blundell and Costa Dias 2009, Daw
and Hatfield 2018a, b, Ryan, Burgess, and Dimick 2015)or when a study involves small sample sizes
(Brewer, Crossley, and Joyce 2017). Additionally, it has been well-established that standard error
corrections that attempt to adjust for violations of the assumed independence of the repeated
measures in longitudinal datasets are needed to obtain accurate Type I error rates (Abhay, Donohue III,
and Zhang 2014, Bertrand, Duflo, and Mullainathan 2004, Donald and Lang 2007, Helland and Tabarrok
2004, Schell, Griffin, and Morral 2019). Despite the wealth of knowledge concerning best practices and
the challenges of using DID models in various settings, there have been no comphrenensive

examinations of their performance across settings realistic for state opioid policy evaluation. In fact, we
were aware of only one other study considering the appropriateness of methodological approaches
applied to another area of state public health policy; namely, Schell, Griffin, and Morral (2019) considers
the appropriateness of using various analytic approaches for evaluating state gun policy laws on
outcomes. This study aims to help fill this gap and the notable dearth of rigorous studies examining the
appropriateness of analytic methods being commonly used to evaluate important public health
problems and make policy recommendations.
More specifically, this study seeks to provide needed guidance about which statistical methods are
most appropriate for measuring the impacts of state-level opioid policies on opioid-related mortality,
with lessons that apply to state policy evaluations more broadly. Using a simulation study based on
observed state-level opioid related outcomes, we assessed the relative performance of multiple
statistical methods commonly used in evaluation studies of state-level opioid policies. Specifically, we
compared their performance regarding Type I error rates, bias, statistical power, and root mean
squared error to facilitate a more informed consideration of the existing literature and to support
sound future state policy evaluations. We found that some commonly-used methods have poor
statistical performance, and we provide important insights to statisticians and researchers regarding
methods to estimate policy effects. We show that there is still work to be done regarding
development of methods that provide accurate results in these complex policy settings.

2. METHODS
In this section, we describe the data structure and general empirical models considered in our
simulation study as well as the different features of the statistical models that we explored in our
simulation study.

2.1 Data Structure
The data structure we considered in this study was longitudinal, repeated measures data measured
on an annual basis where states were the units of interest. We used repeated measures of the
outcome (opioid-related mortality) measured annually over 18 years, clustering time points within
state, providing a total number of observations is 50*18 = 900. We did not consider individual-level
data.
2.2 General Empirical Models Considered
The focus of our simulation study was to compare statistical methods for estimating policy impact
using annual state-level outcomes, given a policy landscape in which states implemented a given policy at
different times. A common analytic approach for such aggregate longitudinal data in the health services
literature, including opioid policy studies, is broadly termed the DID approach. A DID study design
seeks to account for both selection bias (by controlling for differences in pre-policy outcomes between
policy and comparison states) and historical trends (by controlling for temporal trends that are
unrelated to the policy). Essentially, DID estimation compares the pre-policy to post-policy change in
the treated group to the corresponding pre-period to post-period change in the comparison group.
This “difference in differences” provides an estimate of the policy effect, while subtracting out
potential confounding arising from systematic differences between states implementing versus not
implementing a policy, temporal trends, and other exogenous factors.
Below, we introduce key notation for the general DID model framework our simulation study focuses
on. Let 𝐴𝐴it = 0 or 1 denote an indicator for whether state i (where 𝑖𝑖 = 1, … , 𝑁𝑁) has implemented the

generic policy of interest at time t (where 𝑡𝑡 = 1, … , 𝑇𝑇). Let 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 denote the outcome of interest, namely

opioid-related mortality rates, as measured longitudinally for state i over time 𝑡𝑡 = 1, … , 𝑇𝑇.

The DID specification is commonly implemented as the two-way fixed effects model which controls
for both state- and time-fixed effects as model covariates, expressed as:
𝑔𝑔(𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) = 𝛼𝛼 ∙ 𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜷𝜷 ∙ 𝑿𝑿𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜌𝜌𝒊𝒊 + 𝜎𝜎𝑡𝑡 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

(1)

where 𝑔𝑔(. ) denotes the general linear model (GLM) link function (e.g., linear, log), 𝑿𝑿𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 denotes a vector
of time-varying state-level confounders, and 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 denotes the error term. State fixed effects, 𝜌𝜌𝑖𝑖 , quantify

potential differences in the outcome across states and time fixed effects, 𝜎𝜎𝑡𝑡 , quantify temporal

national trends. The coefficient estimate 𝑎𝑎� represents the DID estimator, namely the policy effect of 𝐴𝐴
after accounting for differences between states implementing and not implementing a policy and time
trends.
Equation 1 is generally estimated using ordinary least squares. There are 3 commonly used ways to
estimate the standard error of the point estimate (𝑎𝑎�): (i) no adjustment; (ii) Huber adjustment = robust
estimators (also known as sandwich estimators, or Huber corrected estimates) that attempt to adjust

the standard error for violations of distributional assumptions (White 1980, Zeileis 2004); or (iii) cluster
adjustment = adjustments to account for possible violations of the assumed independence of
observations within states (White 1980, Zeileis 2004, 2006).
When implemented using regression analysis, this basic DID estimation is subject to the standard
statistical assumptions for linear regression (Wooldridge 2009). Additionally, the DID estimator relies
on two additional assumptions: the “common shocks” assumption and the “parallel counterfactual
trends” assumption (Angrist and Pischke 2009). The parallel counterfactual trends assumption states
that the intervention and comparison groups would have the same trends in the outcome over time,
had the intervention not been implemented. Note that outcome levels themselves are not assumed to
be equivalent across groups, but rather changes in the outcome; state and time differences are
accounted for by fixed effects. When multiple pre-period observations are available, the parallel

counterfactual trends assumption can be partially assessed by statistically testing whether the preintervention trends differ across intervention groups (Ryan, Burgess, and Dimick 2015). However, the
parallel counterfactual trends assumption is not fully testable, since this assumption cannot be
assessed for the post-period and in the post-period the assumption involves unobserved
counterfactual outcomes.
Additionally, the common shocks assumption states that both groups were subject to similar
exogenous factors that may affect the outcome of interest (e.g., market trends, regulatory climate,
etc.) and had similar reactions to such factors (Ryan, Burgess, and Dimick 2015). Similarly, this
assumption also implies that there is no “anticipatory” effects on the outcome in the intervention
group during the pre-period, as individuals are reacting to knowledge of the impending intervention.
On top of fitting the two-way fixed effects model in equation (1), we also considered three
additional candidate statistical models in our simulation, based on a literature review identifying the
most commonly applied statistical models used in studies trying to assess the causal impacts of opioid
policies (Schuler et al., Under Review). Each of these alternative models vary the methods used to
control for average differences in the outcome across states by either (a) detrending the data with
state-specific linear slopes over time; (b) fitting a one-period lagged autoregressive (AR) model, and (c)
estimating a flexible generalized estimating equations (GEE). The statistical assumptions underlying
each of these approaches are important to consider.
While equation (1) adjusts for state variability with respect to average outcome levels, another
frequently utilized model additionally adjusts for state variability in average outcome trends with statespecific linear slopes over time (referred to as “detrending” the data). Thus, we considered the
potential benefits of detrending in our simulation study. Our detrended model can be expressed as:
𝑔𝑔(𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) = 𝛼𝛼 ∙ 𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜷𝜷 ∙ 𝑿𝑿𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜌𝜌𝒊𝒊 + 𝜎𝜎𝑡𝑡 + 𝜂𝜂 ∙ t + ∑50
𝑠𝑠=1(𝜔𝜔𝑠𝑠 ∙ 𝑡𝑡 ∙ 1(𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑖 = 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 )) + 𝜐𝜐𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

(2)

This detrended model expands on model (1) by adding in a linear main effect for time (t) along with
state-specific linear trends. The detrended model can be seen as an improvement over equation (1)
when it is likely that states will have different time trends in the outcome. The model aims to capture
these time trends using a linear interaction between continuous time (t) and state-level indicators in an
effort to avoid over-fitting the data. However, if the assumption of linearity in the time trends does not
hold, this model will be misspecified and it is of interest to understand the impact such
misspecification might have on our real world state-level data of opioid-related mortality.
Second, we explored whether including a lagged outcome measure (i.e., the outcome at the prior
year 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖(𝑡𝑡−1) ) in the model improves policy effect estimation when studying opioid-related mortality by

fitting AR models to our simulated data. The motivation for including lagged outcome measures is to

both help control for average differences across states implementing versus not implementing a policy
and to better predict future outcomes when there is high autocorrelation. Such high correlation is
expected in repeated, annual measures of state-level opioid-related outcomes like opioid-related
mortality. Thus, it is of interest in this study to assess how controlling for this lag, assuming a linear
relationship between the GLM link and the lagged value of the outcome might serve to improve the
model in equation (1). AR models include lagged measures of the outcome (e.g., 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖(𝑡𝑡−1) ) as covariates to
control for potential average differences in outcome trends and have been shown to yield more

accurate effect estimates in the recent gun policy simulation study when examining total firearms deaths
(Schell et al., 2018). In particular, we tested the relative performance of the best performing AR model
identified from the gun policy study in which we estimated the following specification of our outcome model:
𝑔𝑔(𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) = 𝛼𝛼 ∙ (𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 − 𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡−1 ) + 𝜷𝜷 ∙ 𝑿𝑿𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛾𝛾 ∙ 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖−1 + 𝜎𝜎𝑡𝑡 + 𝜖𝜖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

(3)

Notable, this model includes time fixed effects, 𝜎𝜎𝑡𝑡 , to quantify temporal trends across time but does

not include state fixed effects to quantify potential average differences in the outcome across states.
Instead, the model attempts to control for confounding by state using the lagged term (𝛾𝛾 ∙ 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖−1).

Including this autoregressive predictor creates a “change” model in which the policy’s effect is

indicated by the extent to which the opioid-related death rate in a given year is higher or lower than
expected given the prior year’s rate in the same state (closely related to first-differences models
depending on value of autoregressive term – here 𝛾𝛾� ). As such, we coded the policy variable (A) using
change coding (𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 − 𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡−1 ) rather than standard effect coding (𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) since early work with

autoregressive models (e.g., Cochrane and Orcutt (2012)) demonstrated that effect size estimates can
be substantially biased AR models that use standard effects coding. The coding of the policy variable
needs to take into account the biasing effect of the AR relationship which occurs because controlling
for the prior value of the outcome often, indirectly, controls for exactly the effect you are trying to
measure. The coefficient estimate 𝑎𝑎� on the change coding term represents the AR estimator of the

policy effect of 𝐴𝐴. While commonly used in the broader comparative case study literature, this approach
is uncommon in in opioid policy evaluations.

Finally, we considered the use of generalized estimating equations (GEE) which represent a
commonly used alternative to the DID models specified in (1) and (2) in the context of longitudinal
analyse (Fitzmaurice, Laird, and Ware 2011, Hardin and Hilbe 2003, Liang and Zeger 1986). GEE
methods estimate the parameters of a model in which there are correlations between the
observations within states by specifying a covariance structure for the clustered outcomes. Here we
estimated the following regression model
𝑔𝑔(𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) = 𝛼𝛼 ∙ 𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜷𝜷 ∙ 𝑿𝑿𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜎𝜎𝑡𝑡 + 𝜁𝜁𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

(4)

where we had time fixed effects 𝜎𝜎𝑡𝑡 , effects coding for the policy variable and time-varying state-level

confounders measured in 𝑿𝑿𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 . GEE is a semi-parametric method that requires specification of the

covariance matrix for within-subject observations (e.g., exchangeable, autoregressive, unstructured).

We assume an autocorrelation structure of order 1 (AR1) which means the correlation structure R for
the repeated measures within each state is
𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡,𝑚𝑚 = �

1 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑡𝑡 = 𝑚𝑚
𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑡𝑡 ≠ 𝑚𝑚

|𝜌𝜌𝑡𝑡−𝑠𝑠 |

for each the t, m element of R. GEE estimates of regression parameters are obtained using an iterative
algorithm.
We emphasize that the statistical properties and underlying assumptions in these model differ in
how we were specifiying the right-hand side of the outcome model (for all three models) and in how
we are handling the correlation between annual measures of the outcome within a state (for the AR
and GEE models). The optimal model should be the one for which the underlying assumptions of the
model match the state-level data we had available to us for the analysis. It is often difficult to test
model assumptions in real world applications and as such we used a simulation to understand the
relative performance of these different models on our data.
Given that only a few published opioid policy studies have utilized random effects to control for
unobservable state variation (Schuler Under review ), we did not consider random effect models in this
study.
2.3 Statistical Models Tested via Simulation
In total, we identified 17 candidate models, detailed below and summarized in Table 1, drawing
from our review of the opioid policy literature (Schuler Under review ) as well as the best models
identified from the recent gun policy simulation study by Schell, Griffin, and Morral (2019). (Note that
those results have not been widely implemented in opioid policy research, and, importantly, the

conclusions may also differ for the different setting and type of outcome). The different candidate
model specifications were chosen in such a way to allow us to identify the preferred specification
within each of the following domains:

(1) GLM specifications: In statistics, GLM is a flexible generalization of ordinary linear regression that
allows for the outcome being modeled to have an error distribution other than the normal
distribution. As opioid-related deaths are discrete and historically rare events, count models or
models accounting for the skewed nature of the outcome may be more appropriate than
traditional linear models assuming normality. GLMs are advantageous in that alternative
transformations and/or assumptions about opioid-related mortality distribution can be tested

within the same class of models by varying both the link function (𝑔𝑔(. )) and the assumed

distribution function of the outcome. We tested the relative performance of the following GLMs:
linear, log-linear (i.e., a linear model with log-transformed outcome), and two log-link models,
(negative binomial and Poisson).
(2) Regression specification: As noted, we considered four different ways to specify our regression
models: only using two-way fixed effects of time and state in the model, using two-way fixed
effects plus state-specific linear trends (detrended models), AR models, and GEE models.
(3) Standard error estimation: For each model (except the GEE model), we explored the impact of various
methods for estimating standard errors (SE), including robust SE estimators that adjust for
violations of homoskedasticity assumptions in the data or cluster adjustments adjusting for nonindependence in the observations within states. More specifically, for each model run, we
estimated the standard error in three ways: no adjustment; Huber adjustment; and cluster
adjustment.
(4) Use of state-level population weights: Finally, we explored the impact of using state population as
an analytic weight in the linear and log-linear models, an approach commonly used in opioid
policy evaluations [e.g., Ali et al. (2017), Buchmueller and Carey (2018), McInerney (2017),
Paulozzi, Kilbourne, and Desai (2011)]. Given that log-link models (e.g., negative binomial,
Poisson) are conducted directly on the opioid-related death counts (rather than the rates) and do
not need to be weighted to be nationally-representative, we did not examine the impact of
weighting in these models. Using population weights in state-level analyses of opioid-mortality
rates results in models for which each opioid-related death is treated as equally important
regardless of which state it occurred in. Unweighted analyses treats each state, rather than each
person, as equally important (see for example; Bachhuber et al. (2014), Birk and Waddell (2017),

Chang et al. (2016), Dowell et al. (2016), Xu et al. (2018), Yarbrough (2018)). This will result in an
estimation in which a death in small states will have much greater weight than deaths in larger
states. We note that data was generated such that policy effects are constant across all states
regardless of size or other characteristics, so weighting is not expected to bias the asymptotic
values of the effect estimates but may have substantial effects on their SEs.

3. SIMULATION DETAILS
This section describes our simulation study design in detail, including the performance metrics used
to compare the approaches, data sources used in the study and the data generation scheme.
3.1 Metrics for Assessing Relative Performance of Candidate Statistical Methods
To guide selection of the preferred statistical methods, we relied on several statistical metrics
commonly used to judge model performance.
(1) Type I error rate. This is the rate by which a null hypothesis that is true (i.e., there truly is no policy
effect) is rejected based on the model estimated coefficients and standard errors. When data are
generated such that there is no true policy effect (i.e., the null hypothesis is true), the model should
identify a statistically significant effect (i.e., reject the null hypothesis) no more than 5% of the time
if tested with an α =.05 level of significance.
(2) Power. Power refers to the ability of the model to correctly identify that the null hypothesis is false.
Typically, studies are considered to have good power for a given effect size when they have 80% or
higher power. When comparing statistical power across candidate models, we needed to ensure that
we were properly penalizing models with high Type I error rates (see Section 4.1). For all models, we
computed a correction factor based on the null runs that can be applied to the estimated standard errors
from the given model to ensure a Type I error rate of 0.05; we then used this correction factor when

calculating the appropriate level of power for a given model in the non-null runs. For virtually all the
models, this correction factor inflates the estimated standard errors in a given model and helps us ensure
power is being accurately captured for the models.
(3) Bias. Bias assesses the average difference between the estimated effect and true effect over all
simulations showing the tendency of the estimated effects of a given model to fall closer or further
from the true effect on average.
(4) Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). RMSE provides us with a broader measure of the difference
between the estimated policy effects in an individual simulated data set and the true policy effect
by taking the square root of the sum of the mean squared errors (e.g., �∑5000
�𝑘𝑘 − 𝛼𝛼)2 ) where 𝛼𝛼
𝑘𝑘=1 (𝛼𝛼
represents the true policy effect and 𝛼𝛼� represents the estimated policy effect from a given

simulation and model. It gives us a sense of how much error exists occurs for a given model
specification, and takes into account both bias and variance.
3.2 Data Sources and Measures
Our outcome of interest is the annual, state-specific opioid mortality rate per 100,000 state
residents, using the 1999-2016 National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) Multiple Cause of Death
mortality files. Consistent with other studies (Abouk, Pacula, and Powell 2019, Chan, Burkhardt, and
Flyr In press, Kilby 2015), opioid related overdose deaths were identified based on ICD10-CM-external
cause of injury codes X40-X44, X60-64, X85, and Y10-Y14, indicating accidental and intentional
poisoning, with opioid overdose based on the presence of one of the following diagnosis codes: T40.1
poisoning by heroin, T40.2 poisoning by natural and semisynthetic opioids (e.g., oxycodone,
hydrocodone), T40.3 poisoning by methadone, and T40.4 poisoning by synthetic opioids excluding
methadone (e.g., fentanyl, tramadol).
Given concerns about model overfitting in the presence of numerous covariates, we included a

single covariate: state-level unemployment rate (U.S. Department of Labor 2019). This covariate was
selected both because of the frequency of its use in opioid policy studies (Schuler Under review ), and
its potential confounding associations with both opioid-related mortality and state policy responses.
Annual state-level unemployment data comes from the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor
Statistics. Sensitivity analyses including a broader set of covariates (e.g., poverty rate, income level and
percent race/ethnicity and age groups) resulted in no meaningful change to the general findings with a
slight increase in model precision. Thus, we present findings from the more parsimonious model.
We also note that since the AR models use lagged outcomes in the regression model, they utilized
one less year of data from the time series than the other models considered.
3.3 Simulation Data Generation
The simulation design builds directly from prior work that compared statistical methods for
evaluating the impact of state laws on firearms deaths (Schell, Griffin, and Morral 2019). For each
simulation iteration, we selected a random subset of k states to be the policy/treated group (i.e., 𝐴𝐴it = 1
at some point in the study period), with remaining states serving as the comparison group (i.e., 𝐴𝐴it = 0

for the entire study period). We generated a time-varying indicator for whether a state has implemented
the hypothetical opioid policy (𝐴𝐴it) in a given year.
When generating the implementation date for the treated states who enact the policy, we
randomly selected both the month and year of policy enactment so we had fractional values for the
amount of time a law was in effect during the first year, restricting the year to be between 2002 and
2013 to ensure we had three years of outcome data before and after enactment. This simulation
represents the simplified scenario in which there is no confounding by observed or unobserved
covariates or by lagged values of the outcome, 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖(𝑡𝑡−1) . Once a policy is implemented, it remains in

effect throughout the study period. In the first year of implementation the intervention variablve is coded
as a variable between 0 and 1, indicating the percentage of the year the policy was in effect.
For control states and treated (policy-enacting) states in the pre-policy period, generated 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 values

are equal to the actual observed state-specific, year-specific opioid overdose rates. For treated (policyenacted) states, we generated synthetic overdose outcomes (𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) for the time periods following the

randomly assigned policy implementation date, allowing us to systematically vary the magnitude of the true
effect of 𝐴𝐴 on 𝑌𝑌.

Simulation conditions varied the following factors:
(1) Effect size. We considered the performance of our candidate statistical models when the policy
had null effect, as well as an effect size (ES) of ±5%, ±15% and ±25%. For null effect conditions,
post-policy 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 values for the policy states were generated such that they were not correlated with

𝐴𝐴it (i.e., setting 𝛼𝛼 = 0 in equation 1). For conditions with a true policy effect, synthetic post-policy 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖
values were generated to reflect a fixed increase/decrease relative to the true state-specific, yearspecific opioid overdose rate. For a given candidate model, this data generation process was

tailored according to the specific link function used in the model, such that the absolute magnitude
of the generated ES would be equivalent on both the linear (i.e., additive) and log linear (i.e.,
multiplicative) scale. For each ES, we generated data in which the policy has both a positive and
negative effect on the outcome in order to assess whether candidate models were biased towards
estimating positive or negative effects, as well as assessing bias.
(2) Number of treated units. We also investigated the role of the number of policy states, simulating data
in which 1, 5, 15 and 30 states implemented the policy, respectively. We note that the maximum
total sample size is always 50.
(3) Timing of policy effect. State policies often do not become 100% effective immediately after

implementation, making it important to consider variation in the onset of policy effectiveness. We
consider two possible conditions: an instantaneous effect and a 3-year linear phase-in effect. In
both the data generating and analytic models, an instantaneous effect was specified as a simple
step-function that has a value of zero when the policy is not in effect and a value of one when the
policy is in effect. The gradual policy effect was specified as a linear spline with values starting at
zero and reaching an asymptote 3 years after implementation.
We assess performance of each candidate model across the same set of 5000 randomly generated datasets.
Simulations were conducted in R; code is available in the appendix. Extensive results for all statistical
models considered in our simulation are available via our Shiny tool
(https://elizabethmcneer.shinyapps.io/statmodelsim/).
4. RESULTS
In the results below, we first present findings regarding Type 1 error rates, highlighting cases where
models have unreasonably high Type I errors. Next, we discuss our findings regarding power over a
range of different effect sizes, highlighting analytic ways in which models can be optimized to increase
power in a study. Third, we discuss bias for each model, assessing which analytic approaches introduce
bias versus those that do not. Finally, we discuss root mean squared error (RMSE) in an effort to
identify the best models that minimize the bias-variance trade off. In each section, we first discuss
findings for the linear model, comparing the overall performance of the two-way fixed effects,
detrended, AR, and GEE models and briefly highlighting the impact of using population weights in the
linear model. Then we discuss the relative performance of the different GLMs for a given regression
specification (e.g., two-way fixed effects), comparing the relative performance of the linear, log-linear,
Poisson, and negative binomial models. In all cases, we report our summary statistics averaging across

the simulations where the policy has an instantaneous and 3-year phase-in, noting here that
performance for all metrics gets worse the longer it takes for a policy to become effective.
4.1 Type I Error Rates
Figure 1 shows the Type I error rates for the four different linear models considered in our
simulation, all of which use population weights: (1a) the two-way fixed effects model, (1b), the
detrended model, (1c) the AR model, and (1d) the GEE model. Of note, as shown in Figure 1a, we saw
very high Type I error rates for most of the models (ranging from 0.29 to 0.67). However, use of cluster
adjustment to the standard error greatly reduced the Type I error rates when 5 or more states are
implementing a policy, but they generally were still 2 to 3 times larger than the traditional target of
0.05 (e.g., range between 0.09 and 0.17). The detrended model, shown in Figure 1b, was similar
though we noted that Type I error rates for the detrended model tends to be better (e.g., lower;
mostly less than 0.4). In contrast, Figure 1c highlights the general finding that AR models do not require
use of any standard error adjustment to obtain Type I error rates that are reasonable when the
number of states implementing a policy is greater than or equal to 5 (e.g., Type I error rates for the
linear, population weighted AR model range from 0.04 to 0.06). In fact, use of standard error
adjustments in the AR models tends to inflate the Type I error rates. Finally, Figure 1d shows the Type I
error rates for the linear GEE model with population weights. As shown, Type I error rates reach 0.18
or less once at least 5 states are implementing a policy, though the rates are also still two to three
times higher than the traditional target of 0.05. The findings concerning the relative performance of
the different regression specifications shown (two-way fixed effects vs detrended vs AR) holds across
all GLM specifications (linear, log-linear, Poisson, and negative binomial).
Figure 1. Type I error rates for the four different linear models considered, all with population weights:
(1a) the two-way fixed effects model, (1b), the detrended model, (1c) the AR model, and (1d) the GEE
model. Black horizontal line denotes the target Type I error rate value of 0.05.

Additional findings from our simulation studies show that weighting using the population size in the
linear models results in slightly higher Type I error rates in the two-way fixed effects, detrended, and
GEE models than for the corresponding unweighted versions of these models (see Shiny Application).
Conversely, for the AR models, use of population weights do not consistently perform better or worse
than unweighted models.
Next, we explored the relative performance of the different GLMs. We note here that the best four
models in terms of Type I error when using the best performing standard error adjustment and
comparing the maximum Type I error rates across the four different sample sizes include: the linear AR
weighted model (0.06), the linear AR unweighted model (0.07), the log-linear AR unweighted model
(0.07), and the negative binomial AR model (0.07). Figure 2 shows the Type I error rates for the AR
models for our four different GLMs: (2a) linear (unweighted), (2b) log linear (unweighted), (2c) Poisson,
and (2d) negative binomial. This figure highlights how well the AR models do in terms of Type I error
rates, regardless of the GLM model. It also highlights that generally the log-linear model performed

slightly worse than the linear model and that the Poisson model can produce rather poor performance
relative to the other GLMs.

Type I error rate value of 0.05.

4.2 Power
Figure 3 shows power (i.e., correct rejection rates) as a function of the number of states
implementing a policy and the effect size impact of the policy for the four different linear models
considered in our simulation, all of which use population weights: (2a) the two-way fixed effects
model, (2b) the detrended model, (2c) the AR model, and (2d) the GEE model. Power is shown for the
model that uses the best method for SE adjustment (namely, the SE adjustment that produces a Type I
error rate closest to 0.05).
Figure 3. Power as a function of the number of states implementing a policy and the effect size impact
of the policy for four different linear models, all with population weights: (2a) the two-way fixed
effects model, (2b), the detrended model, (2c) the AR model, and (2d) the GEE model. Solid line = 5%
effect size; dotted line = 15% effect size; dashed line = 25% effect size.

In all cases, the power increases as either the sample size of states implementing a policy increases
or as the effect size of the policy increases for the range of sample sizes considered here. Most notably,
the commonly used two-way fixed effects model (Figure 3a) has poor power for all effect sizes,
reaching a maximum power of 0.27 when the number of states implementing a policy reached 30 and
the effect size of the policy is 25%. Figure 3b shows that power tends to increase for the detrended
model when compared to the linear two-way fixed effects model that does not control for state
specific time trends. In contrast, to the linear two-way fixed effects model, the detrended model
reaches a maximum power of 0.41 when the number of states implementing a policy reached 30 and
the effect size of the policy is 25%. Still, power is highest for the AR model (Figure 3c) in comparison to
either the linear two-fixed effects model or the linear detrended model, with maximum power of 0.73
when the number of states implementing a policy reached 30 and the effect size of the policy is 25%. In
the case of using population weights, the linear GEE has similar power to the linear two-way fixed
effects with the weighted GEE model reaching a maximum power of 0.30 in Figure 3d.

We found that weighted linear and log-linear models tend to have lower power than the
unweighted versions of these models. The maximum power for the weighted versus unweighted linear
two-way fixed effects model is 0.27 versus 0.40, respectively. For the linear AR model, it is 0.81 versus
0.72, respectively, when 30 states are implementing a policy and the effect size is large (25%). Use of
population weights in the GEE model has the greatest impact with maximum power going from 0.30 to
0.67 when one removes the population weights from the model.
Figure 4 shows the average power across all scenarios for each type of model to highlight the
relative performance of the different models considered. Power is poor across all methods, but, of
note, we saw clear superiority of both the linear AR models (weighted or unweighted; average power =
0.24 and 0.22, respectively) and the negative binomial models (power ranges from 0.20 to 0.23). The
worst performing models are the linear and log-linear two-way fixed effects models and the lienar
weighted GEE model (power ranges from 0.09 to 0.11). The Poisson models considered have power
that ranges from 0.12 for the two-way fixed effects model to 0.18 for the AR model; for each type of
model, the negative binomial is clearly more powerful.

Most notably for all models considered in our simulation, the models had extremely low power to
detect small effect sizes of 5% for a policy, an effect size that would equate to a reduction in 700
opioid-related mortalities per year (e.g., maximum power for the negative binomial models was
approximately 0.08 and power for the linear models ranged from 0.04 to 0.11).
4.3. Bias
Figure 5 shows the percent bias for all models considered in this simulation when the true effect of
a law is 5% (or ~700 deaths per year). We first standardized the results so quantities from the linear
and nonlinear models represent the count of deaths by which the model is biased on average over all
the simulations. Then, we converted bias into percent bias by dividing by 700. In general, bias is low for
most models (e.g., less than 10%) with the exception of the non-linear AR models (14-25% percent);
however, care needs to be taken when comparing the linear models to the log-linear, Poisson, and
negative binomial models. In addition, we found that converting all bias metrics into linear units (count
of deaths) provides a small advantage to the linear models when making comparisons to nonlinear
models because this metric is directly proportional to the model coefficients in a linear model. Thus,
direct comparisons across link functions here (e.g, linear versus log-linear) is not recommended. For
example, it is possible that a negative binomial model that has unbiased model coefficients in their
native units will show a small bias on the exponentiated coefficients used to convert the bias to a total
count of deaths. There is no method to compare bias across linear and nonlinear models that allows
both to be in their native units. When bias measures are converted into the native units of the negative
binomial models (log risk ratios), the negative binomial models tended to show slightly better
performance relative to the linear models than is evident in Figure 5. Taken together, we found that
the greatest bias for each type of type of GLMs occurs in the AR models as would be expected. Further,

as the number of states implementing a law or the size of the effect of the law increases, bias
decreases to less than 5% for all models considered (see Shiny app).

Note: It is not really recommended that we directly compare across link functions here since there is no method
to compare bias across linear and nonlinear models that for a one-to-one comparison. The statistics shown will
slightly favor linear over non-linear models since we have to convert

4.4 Root Mean Square Error
Figure 6 shows the average RMSE for the simulations where the true policy effect is 0 for each
model considered in our simulation. First, we considered findings for the linear model, comparing the
overall performance of the two-way fixed effects, detrended, AR, and GEE models. In general, the
RMSE of the two-way fixed model can be improved upon by using detrending or AR models (e.g., for
the linear two-way fixed effects with population weight model the RMSE = 1.78 versus 1.69 for the
detrended model and 1.08 for the AR model). The linear AR models have the lowest RMSE (1.08-1.12).
For the linear two-way fixed effects, detrended and GEE models, the unweighted models have lower

RMSE as compared to the weighted versions of the same models, while for the AR models, we saw
slightly lower RMSE for the weighted models.

Note: It is not really recommended that we directly compare across link functions here since there is no method to compare
RMSE across linear and nonlinear models that for a one-to-one comparison

Next, we considered the RMSE for the non-linear models. Notably, we found that RMSE for the count
models is minimized by using the negative binomial over the Poisson or log-linear models. For the
negative binomial model, the detrended and two-way fixed effects models have the lowest RMSE
(0.22) while the AR model has the highest RMSE (0.31).
5. DISCUSSION
Our findings highlight several key challenges for opioid-policy research and more broadly statelevel policy evaluations. First, policy makers using the results of these models to make decisions must
recognize the challenges of such studies given the limited total sample size of 50 states. Power for the
majority of scenarios was lower than the typically desired 0.80, even in the most advantageous cases

when we had 30 out of 50 states implementing the policy of interest and a large assumed effect size of
25%. Furthermore, Type I error rates for the majority of models when fewer than 15 states are
implementing a new policy were unreasonably high, meaning these models could show a notable
effect of a policy when in fact such an effect does not exist. It is critical that researchers use models
that minimize Type 1 error rates whenever possible and use of standard error corrections to ensure a
Type I error rate of 0.05 are needed in this space.
Additionally, we found notably differences in the relative performance of commonly used statistical
methods for estimating the effects of state-level opioid policies which has substantial implications for
interpretation and application to state-level policy evaluations more generally. In our simulations, we
found two classes of models that performed best when estimating the effects of a simulated opioid
policy on opioid-related mortality in terms of (i) producing Type I error rates near 0.05, (ii) maximizing
power for the scenarios considered, and (iii) minimizing RMSE. These were 1) linear AR models
(weighted or unweighted) and 2) negative binomial models. Linear two-way fixed effects models and
Poisson models generally performed the worst across the scenarios considered. To maximize power for
opioid-related mortality, we highly recommend that researchers utilize either linear autoregressive
models or negative binomial model specifications when estimating the effects of state-level policies on
opioid-related mortality.
It is unclear how many of these specific recommendations are notable for any specific state policy
evaluation, as the findings will necessarily be dependent on the level and distribution of the outcome
variable as well as the rate of state-level adoption of the policy. At a minimum, however, we think four
general recommendations for practice come from our findings. First, it is critical to utilize cluster
adjustments to the standard errors when using state and year fixed effects in a linear or log-linear
specification of a model evaluating state policy adoption. Second, use of an autoregressive term is

particularly helpful in the linear model in terms of RMSE, when modeling opioid-related mortality as a
crude rate. Third, detrending models with state and year fixed effects improves performance so long as
not overfitting the data. Fourth, use of a negative binomial model performs better than a Poisson
model when modeling counts of opioid-related mortality.
Although these generalizations have been found by others, they have not been well appreciated by
the statistical or applied literature, and questions have remained regarding best practices with realworld data like opioid-related mortality rates. For example, with regard to standard error corrections,
prior simulation studies (Abhay, Donohue III, and Zhang 2014, Helland and Tabarrok 2004) show that
cluster adjustments are needed to reduce Type I error rates. Bertrand, Duflo, and Mullainathan (2004)
showed that the classic sandwich estimator does poorly with small samples; this paper also shows DID
without adjustment has high Type I errors (approximately 45%) in their case study data where they also
randomly simulated random “placebo” laws. Our work builds on this prior work by highlighting the
challenges to evaluating state-level policies within the context of the opioid crisis and with respect to
opioid-related mortality, a commonly used outcome in evaluations of state-level opioid policies.
Of note in this simulation, we never formally tested the functional form of the model to help us
determine the best performing GLM specification. We did this because we aimed to compare
commonly used specifications that have been published in the literature. In practice, it is highly
recommended that more careful consideration be given to selection of the GLM specification. For
example, one way to limit concerns about using an inappropriate model is to do a parks test and
boxcox test to determine what is appropriate for the outcome transformation and variance adjustment
(Box and Cox 1964). We also note that use of population weights generally had small effects on
performance so the choice whether to use them should be based on the inferences desired by the
research, although this may be in part be a reflection of the situation considered, with constant effects

across states. Finally, we note that we expected bias to be small in our simulations given the policies
are randomly assigned; the bias is largely going to be driven by model misspecification.
Findings from our simulations on opioid-related mortality are highly similar to findings for total
firearm deaths considered in Schell, Griffin, and Morral (2019). The models considered here are
virtually identical to the models considered in the Schell, Griffin, and Morral (2019) study, though we
expand the simulation scenarios to consider performance across a wider range of assumed effect sizes
of the law (5% to 25% versus 3% in Schell, Griffin, and Morral (2019)). In their case, one model proved
optimal across all performance metrics considered: the negative binomial AR model, whereas we
found in favor of two set of models of which the negative binomial AR model is one. We suspect this is
in part due to the additional consideration of a range of effect sizes and that we only assumed a threeyear phase in (versus five in Schell, Griffin, and Morral (2019)) for the slower phase in period of the
new policy.
The goal of this study was to assess the relative performance of commonly used statistical methods
for evaluating the impacts of state-level opioid policies on opioid-related mortality and provide insights
into the limitations and sources of bias introduced by more commonly used methods. Study findings can
help statisticians, researchers, and policy makers better gauge the validity of the existing evidence base
and to conduct sound evaluations of new policies enacted by states. The use of simulation studies to
assess the statistical properties of commonly used methods is an innovative yet underutilized approach
for helping researchers examine methods’ performance in a specific context (Black et al. 2019).
The simulation design has several limitations and future research is needed to build upon this work
and provide best methods for the field. First, by randomly selecting states that will enact a given policy,
this simulation represents the simplified scenario in which there is no confounding by observed or
unobserved covariates or by lagged values of the outcome. Future work will expand the simulation to

consider more complex scenarios where such confounding exists given the reality that states
implementing certain policies likely differ from their comparison states in systematic ways. For example,
it is often the case that the outcome of concern will be notably increasing among states that choose to
enact the policy being evaluated (e.g., states enacting pain management clinic laws have notably higher
fatal opioid overdose rates in the years before implementing the law than states without these laws
(Popovici et al. 2018)). Second, while there are numerous outcomes of interest when evaluating the
impact of an opioid policy, we focused on fatal overdoses given that approximately 1/3 of published
evaluation studies of state opioid policies use this outcome. Future work will expand to consider
additional outcome domains like prescribing and distribution.
More broadly, as noted by Schell, Griffin, and Morral (2019): “A scientific field built on studies with
such low power (e.g., less than 0.20) will have a large fraction of significant results that are spurious, a
substantial proportion of significant effects that are in the wrong direction, and significant effects that
substantially overestimate the true effect size (Gelman and Carlin 2014).” There is an urgent need for
the field to develop more robust and powerful methods that can be used to help guide state-policy. This
call is needed to face the current crises in the U.S. (gun violence and the opioid epidemic) but also
extends beyond to future crises that will develop (e.g., climate change). One area that holds promise
would be to promote the use of Bayesian approaches to estimate state-level policy effects as a way to
ensure better representation of the large amount of uncertainty in these analyses (Schell, Griffin, and
Morral 2019). Research in this areas is needed to help us ensure we are meeting the needs of applied
policy researchers and key decision makers.
