    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper estimates a dynamic structural model of discrete R&D investment and quantifies its cost and long-run benefit for German manufacturing firms. The dynamic model incorporates linkages between the firm's R&D choice, product and process innovations, and future productivity and profits. The long- run payoff to R&D is measured as the proportional difference in expected firm value generated by the R&D investment. It increases firm value by 6.7 percent for the median firm in high-tech manufacturing industries but only 2.8 percent in low-tech industries. Simulations show that reductions in maintence costs of innovation significantly raise investment rates and productivity while reductions in startup costs have little effect.\n\n",
