Individual Subjective Survival Curves
Li Gan, Michael Hurd, and Daniel McFadden
NBER Working Paper No. 9480
January 2003
JEL No. C81
ABSTRACT
Testing life-cycle models and other economic models of saving and consumption at micro level
requires knowledge of individuals’ subjective believes of their mortality risk. Previous studies have
shown that individual responses on subjective survival probabilities are generally consistent with
life tables. However, survey responses suffer serious problems caused by focal responses of zero and
one. This paper suggests using a Bayesian update model that accounts for the problems encountered
in focal responses. We also propose models that help us to identify how much each individual
deviates from life table in her subjective belief. The resulting individual subjective survival curves
have considerable variations and are readily applicable in testing economic models that require
individual subjective life expectancies.

I. Introduction
Many economic models are based on the forward-looking behavior of economic
agents. Although it is often said that “expectations” about future events are important in
these models, it is the probability distributions of future events that influence the models.
For example, an individual’s consumption and saving decisions are believed to depend
upon concerns regarding future interest rates, the likelihood of dying, and the risk of
substantial future medical expenditures. According to our theories, decision makers have
subjective probability distributions about these and other events in their lives, and
moreover, use them to make decisions about their saving practices.
A typical objective of empirical models on intertemporal decision making is to
estimate responses to changes in variable levels, such as changes in saving due to an
anticipated change in the interest rate. A second objective is to find the extent of an
individual’s risk aversion; namely, what is his or her response to changes in outcome
variability? For instance, do changes in the variability of future income lead to changes in
saving practices? These are worthwhile objectives due to the importance of society of
choices that depend on uncertain future events. For example, poverty in old age depends
partly on an individual’s consumption choices at a younger age. Consequently, how is
consumption influenced by mortality risk and the uncertainty of medical expenditures?
Why do some individuals purchase adequate insurance against unfavorable outcomes
while others do not? Why do many reach retirement age with inadequate financial
provisions for post-retirement living expenses? Is it due to misperceptions about the
probabilities of reaching old age? Do people maintain excessive housing into old age as a

3

hedge against inflation risk? The answers to these and similar questions depend on our
understandings of decision maker reactions to future uncertainty. Moreover, creating
policies that alleviate the consequences of such decision-making processes depends on
answers to the aforementioned questions.
In a few economic models, we have data on probability distributions that are
assumed to approximate those required by decision making models under uncertainty.
Life cycle models of consumption, in which mortality risk helps determine savings, have
been estimated by assuming that individuals have subjective probability distributions on
mortality risk that are the same as those found from life tables (Hurd 1989). A
precautionary motive for saving thus depends on the risk of future medical outlays. It
therefore seems reasonable that the distribution of outlays as estimated from micro data
represents a good approximation of the subjective probability distributions used by
decision makers (Hubbard, Skinner and Zeldes, 1995). More generally, Manski (1993)
has proposed using observed outcome probabilities in panel data as estimations of the
subjective probability distributions for individuals on the panel on the grounds that the
sampling exercise can itself be taken as a “model” of the subjective probability process.
In most applications, however, we do not have adequate data for probability
distributions thus requiring the use of unverifiable assumptions in estimations. For
example, in macroeconomic models expectations are assumed to be rational, which often
yields an estimated relationship. Yet, the rationality assumption cannot be tested outside
of the model’s immediate context. In life cycle models on saving, a cohort’s average
mortality risk may not be well approximated by the mortality risk found on life tables due
to changes in risk; that is, a cohort may not believe that the mortality experience of older

4

cohorts will be the same as his or her own. Furthermore, individuals within the same
cohort will have different subjective evaluations of probability distributions and its
influence on their behavior, even if it is systematically incorrect. However, such
evaluations are not generally observable. These individual heterogeneities often become
problematic in parameter estimates. For example, consider a typical individual utility
function,
u (c t ) =

ct1−γ
,
1− γ

where ct is the consumption at time t, and γ is the risk aversion parameter. The first order
condition in a common formulation is:
1 dct − ht + r − ρ
⋅
=
+ β' Xt ,
ct dt
γ

where ht is the individual subjective hazard rates, while X represents certain sociodemographic variables. In this framework, if ht is not observed but correlated with Xt, we
will have a typical endogeneity problem. If ht is poorly measured, estimations of γ will
subsequently be biased.
Previous studies have typically obtained individual mortality risks through two
different approaches: either by using life tables or by using well-known variations in
mortality rates by economic status. Since mortality risk life tables only vary by age, race,
and sex, there are not enough variations from which to calculate mortality risks. If
subjective mortality risks of individuals with different economic status vary in the same
way as observed mortality rates, model estimations using standard life tables will lead to
biased estimates. Moreover, forecasts of economic status distributions will be incorrect
such that poorer individuals who believe that their mortality risk is higher will spend

5

money faster than what is predicted by the model. Yet, according to observable
characteristics, mortality risk variations can, in principle, be calculated given that some
economic variables are potentially endogenous. More importantly, individuals surely
have subjective probability distributions that are partly related to observable variables.
Two recent surveys have posed questions regarding individual subjective
probabilities including, Asset and Health Dynamics among the Oldest Old (AHEAD) and
the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS). Hurd and McGarry (1995) reveal that average
survival probabilities are very close to those presented in life tables. In a more recent
paper, Hurd and McGarry (2002) use panel data from HRS and find that respondents
modify their probabilities in response to new information such as the onset of a new
illness. Their findings are consistent with an earlier study of Hamermesh (1985) who
surveys a selected sample of economists about their survival probabilities. Although on
average self-reported survival probabilities are consistent with life tables, at the personal
level, however, these probabilities face a serious problem. In all age groups, we find that
a large fraction of respondents give what we call focal-point responses: 0.0 and 1.0.
These responses cannot represent the respondents’ true probabilities as the distribution of
true probabilities should be continuous, and moreover, true probabilities cannot literally
equal zero or one. Thus the main focus of this paper is to “recover” the “true” subjective
survival curve for each respondent. To do so, we develop a Bayesian update model to
accomplish this objective.
In our model, for individuals at age a, we let the prior survival probability
distribution at a future point in time (a+t) be a truncated normal between zero and one
(we do not include zero and one). The conditional density of the observed survival

6

probability is assumed to be a censored normal between zero and one, allowing for the
focal points. In addition, we suggest two approaches that model the deviations of each
individual’s belief from the life table.
We use the posterior density mean as an individual’s estimated subjective survival
probabilities, and estimate the model using the observed death record. Our model
produces optimistic indices to measure the deviation of her subjective belief from the life
table. Consequently, the survival curves for each individual produced by the optimistic
indices do not encounter problems associated with focal points and have considerable
variations. These subjective survival curves are readily applicable to life cycle models
and other economic models that require individual subjective mortality risk.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the selfreported subjective survival probabilities including their consistency with the life table
and problems associated with individual responses. Next, Section 3 introduces a Bayesian
method that helps us to recover underlying subjective survival curves. Section 3 also
introduces two approaches that are used to represent individual deviations from life
tables. In Section 4, we estimate the model and conduct the out-of-sample prediction.
Lastly, we present the paper’s conclusions in Section 5.

II. Individual Subjective Mortality Risk
In the AHEAD sample, each respondent is asked a series of questions about how
likely various presented future events will occur. These future events include: an income
that is consistent with changes in inflation, major medical expenses, leaving a bequest,
receiving financial help from family members, moving to a nursing home, and surviving

7

for another 10-14 years.2 In particular, the survival probability question AHEAD posed to
respondents is as follows:
[Using any] number from 0 to 100 where “0” means that you think there
is absolutely no chance and “100” means that you think the event is
absolutely sure to happen … What do you think are chances that: You will
live to at least A?(A is an age that is 11-15 years older than the
respondent’s current age)

To examine whether these survival probabilities carry useful information, we
compare the subjective survival probabilities with the life tables. Table 1 lists the
average and median survival probabilities from AHEAD and the 1992 life tables for the
target ages used in the AHEAD survival questions as calculated by the first two waves of
AHEAD (e.g., 85 years of age for subjects aged 70-74, 90 years of age for subjects aged
75-79, etc.). In general, younger AHEAD respondents have average subjective
probabilities that closely mirror life table averages, while older respondents have
averages that are substantially higher.3 In general, AHEAD medians are closely related to
those in the life table.
Table 2 lists the percentage of those respondents who gave continuous responses,
focal responses, and no responses in the two waves. Table 2 also lists the transition
probabilities of different response modes between the two waves. In wave 1, only 41.5%
of respondents gave continuous responses, with more than 30% of them providing either

2

Bassett and Lumsdaine (2001) find that all responses contain a common component.
Several reasons are suggested in Hurd, McFadden and Gan (1997) for this finding. One reason is that the
AHEAD survey does not include respondents who reside in nursing homes or other institutional care
facilities. Thus AHEAD represents a healthier population than is represented by a life table.

zero or one as their answers. The subjective probabilities for the remainder of the
population are not available. In wave 2, more than 75% of respondents gave continuous
responses, where approximately 19% of the population either responded zero or one.
Thus the prevalence of focal-point responses indicate that subjective probability
measurements in AHEAD cannot represent the respondents’ true probabilities. Without
correcting for focal responses of zero or one, it is impossible to derive a survival curve
that varies over time. Thus the primary objective of this paper is to “recover” the “true”
subjective survival curve for each respondent, especially for those who give focal
responses of zero or one. In the next section, we develop a Bayesian update model to
achieve this objective.

III. Modeling Individual Subjective Survival Curves
Before we present the model, it is necessary to define the notations that we use
throughout this paper.
•

a: age.

•

t: time at risk.

•

Lo(t): life table survival probability from birth.

•

Soa(t) = Lo(a+t)/ Lo(a): life table survival probability from age a.

•

Λ0(t): life table integrated mortality hazard rate.

•

λ0(t): life table mortality hazard rate.

•

T: an age at which Lo(T) = 0, say T = 108.

•

i: individual.

9

•

Sia(t): personal survival probability from age a to target age a + t for subject i.
Since survival probabilities differ for different people at the same age a, we let
Sia(t) be a random variable with a density π(sia(t)), or π(siat).

•

Λia(t): personal integrated mortality hazard rate at age a.

•

λ ia(t): personal mortality hazard rate at age a.

•

τ: time at risk in interview survival question.

•

piaτ: response to interview survival question. We assume that piaτ is measured with
an error. The density of piaτ conditional on personal survival probability from age
a to age a+ t is given by: f ( piaτ S ia τ = siaτ ) .
By definition, an individual i’s survival curve is:
t
Sia (t ) = exp(− Λ ia ( a + t ) + Λ ia ( a ) ) = exp − ∫ λia ( a + r )dr 
 0


(1)

It is first necessary to specify the plausible families of λia(a+t) that satisfy this
equation. We propose to use the population hazard function λoa(a+t) as a base, while
minimally modifying it to calculate individual λia(a+t). Two alternative ways to specify
the λia(a+t) function include:

λia (a + t ) = γ i λ0 a (a + t ).

(2)

The parameter γi is an individual “optimism” parameter. In comparison with the
life table, if γi >1, then the person is “pessimistic”; however, if γi < 1, then the person is
“optimistic”. Since this model in (2) scales the population hazard, we will refer to it as a
“hazard-scaling” model from now on.
The second model specification is given as:

10



λia (a + t ) = λ0 a  a +


t  1

.
γ ia  γ ia

(3)

This model represents an accelerated failure time frame where the individual
thinks of herself as aging forward from her current age more or less rapidly than the
average person. If a large γi corresponds to slow future aging, i.e, γi>1, then the person is
“optimistic;” however, if γia < 1, then the person is “pessimistic”. Similarly, we refer to
the model in (3) as the “age-scaling” model as it scales ages to represent individual
optimism.
If there is no response error or focal bias in piaτ, the models in (2) and (3) are
accurately identified has having no free parameters. We can then take these models as
actual survival information, and subsequently, decide which model works best. If a
response error or focal bias in piaτ is present, then the personal survival curve is not
forced through piaτ at age a + τ. In this case, we use a Bayesian framework instead. Our
basic assumptions are addressed below. Prior belief for the personal survival curve
density S iat is π ( siat ) . The mean for prior density is exp(− ψ ∆Λ 0 at ) where ψ represents a
parameter for measuring the population’s average subjective optimistic degree (when

ψ = 1 , the mean of prior distribution Siat corresponds with the life table value).
Given S iat , the self-reported survival probability piat has a density of f ( piat siat ) . The
difference between the self-reported survival probability piat and the subjective survival
probability Siat is the measurement error.

11

The primary objective of this paper is to use the observed piaτ to update the prior
density π ( siaτ ) and to obtain the posterior density π ( siaτ | piaτ ). After we observe piaτ , the
posterior density of Siat is given by:

π ( siaτ piaτ ) =

f ( p iaτ siaτ )π (siaτ )

If the loss function is given by: L S it , Sˆ it = E S it − Sˆ it , the best estimator for S iτ

is Sˆ iτ = E (S iτ piaτ ) . We apply Ŝ iτ to the observed death record to obtain the model’s
parameter values. The log-likelihood function is given by:

ln L = ∑ ln Sˆ it + ∑ ln 1 − Sˆit .

(4)

We can obtain estimates of parameters of the prior and posterior densities by
maximizing the log-likelihood function in (4).

IV. Estimation and Out-of-Sample Prediction
Maximizing the likelihood function in (4) requires specifying the distribution
functions. The probability of an agent whose current age is a and who survives until age
a + t is given by s iat . Different agents will have different survival probabilities. For the
population of agents who share the same age a, their surviving probabilities are a random
variable Siat. Let the prior distribution for the random variable Siat, π ( siaτ ) be the
truncated normal distribution. We also let the mean of Siat be exp(− ψ∆Λ 0 at ) , variance σ 22 ,
while the truncation range is 0 < sia < 1 . The prior distribution is given by:

12

 sia − ν ia 

(5)

where via and σ 2 satisfy the equation:
exp(− ψ∆Λ 0 at ) = ν iat − σ 2η (0,1,ν iat , σ 2 ) .

(6)

The right hand side of (6) represents the mean of the truncated normal in (5) with
its formula provided in the Appendix. We let the conditional density of the responses to
interview survival questions follow a censored normal distribution:
 p − µ iaτ
f ( piaτ siaτ ) = φ  iaτ


 1 − µ iaτ
 and Pr ( piaτ = 1 siaτ ) = 1 − Φ

 σ1


 .


Furthermore, we assume that the expected value of the conditional distribution
is sia . Thus, µ ia and σ 1 satisfy the following equation:

The formula for the mean of the censored normal is given in the Appendix. The
censored normal captures the idea that many observations may be at zero or one.
Given piat , the posterior distribution is given by:

In (8), (9) and (10), we obtain the predicted Ŝ ia given the observed subjective
survival probability of piaτ .
Since respondents are interviewed every two years, we update information
regarding whether they are still alive accordingly. The likelihood function in (4) should

(

)

be changed to: ln L = ∑ ln Sˆia 2 + ∑ ln 1 − Sˆia 2 . However, the self-reported survival
alive

dead

probability is not merely the survival probability during a two-year period. Rather, it
typically represents a survival probability 10-15 years in the future.
From (1) and (2), γ i in the hazard-scaling model can be calculated by:

γˆi = −

In sum, we let the prior survival probability distribution from age a to age a+t be
a truncated normal (between 0.0 and 1.0). Moreover, the conditional density of observed
survival probabilities is assumed to be a censored normal, when wallowing for the focal
points 0.0 and 1.0, while the posterior density of the survival probabilities will have a
distribution that does not allow for the focal points 0.0 and 1.0. In order to obtain the
model’s parameter values, we apply the posterior distribution mean to actual death
records between wave 1 and wave 2 in order to estimate a person’s survival probability.
Both the hazard-scaling model in (2) and the age-scaling model in (3) are
estimated. In each model, we first let ψ =1, constraining the mean of the prior density to
be the same as that of the life table. Whenever we do this, we refer to the model as the
constrained model. In addition, we let ψ be a parameter to be estimated. In this case, we
let the data determine if the prior density mean is the same as the life table survival
probability. We refer to such a model as an unconstrained model. Table 3 lists the results
of four different specifications: constrained hazard-scaling model, unconstrained hazard-

16

scaling model, constrained age-scaling model, and finally, unconstrained age-scaling
model. All four specifications yield reasonable estimates that are highly significant.
Moreover, likelihood ratio tests favor unconstrained models over constrained models.
Since we use a survey that has three-waves of data, we can apply the estimated
parameters to actual survival experiences from wave 3 observations and compare the loglikelihood of each model in order to select the best one. We select the sample that are
comprised of individuals who are still alive in wave 2, then calculate the log-likelihood
values separated by those who are alive in wave 3 and those who are dead between waves
2 and 3. The log-likelihood from the out-of-sample prediction is given by:
ln L =

∑ ln Sˆ

ia 4

+

alive in wave 3

∑ ln(1 − Sˆ )
ia 4

dead b/w wave 2 & 3

The log-likelihood values from the out-of-sample predictions are reported in
Table 3. The two unconstrained models perform much better than the corresponding two
constrained models. Between the two unconstrained models, the hazard-scaling model
yields slightly better likelihood values than the unconstrained age-scaling model.
For each specification, we calculate the optimistic indices γi for each individual.
The formula to calculate γi in the hazard-scaling model is given by Equation (11) while
the formula to calculate γi in the age-scaling model is provided in Equation (13). Table 4
presents the summary statistics of the indices and the correlation coefficients from the
four different models’ indices.
From Table 4, we find that the correlation coefficients among different indices are
very high. The lowest correlation coefficient between the unconstrained hazard-scaling
model and the age-scaling model is -.8975. The negative signs for the correlation
coefficients between the two models are expected; that is, in the hazard-scaling model,

the larger the index, the less optimistic a person is. The inverse result can be found for the
age-scaling model; namely, the larger the index, the more optimistic a person is. The
highest correlation coefficient between the unconstrained and the constrained hazard
scaling models is .9887, which is very close to 1.
Although the correlations among the four different specifications are very high,
the means of estimated γ i from the four different models differ significantly. These
means are also reported in Table 4. The estimated γˆi for unconstrained specifications
portrays a more optimistic picture than those for constrained specifications. In the hazardscaling model, the average γˆi in the constrained specification is 1.020, indicating that an
individual’s subjective survival probability on average is very close to the life table. In
the unconstrained version of the hazard model, the average γˆi is .822, indicating that
people are generally optimistic about their survival probabilities. Similar patterns occur in
the two specifications of the age-scaling model.
In the constrained specification, the means of the prior densities (truncated
normal) are constrained according to life-table survival probabilities. The Bayesian
update model only changes its σ2, i.e., the standard deviation of the original normal
density that generates the truncated normal density (See (5) and (6)). Although updating
σ2 may have some effects on the means of the prior densities, the effect is minimal.
Therefore it is not surprising to see that the constrained versions of both models are very
similar to life tables. In the unconstrained specification, and in addition to obtaining the
value of σ2, the updated Bayesian model also changes the mean of the prior densities
through ψ.

18

Although different specifications yield different levels of optimistic indices, an
important feature of all these indices is that a significant heterogeneity exists among all
individuals. The individual heterogeneity in γi can be summarized by a simple regression
that uses the optimism indices to regress certain demographic variables. In this
regression, four different optimism indices represent dependent variables, while
independent variables include a constant, the person’s age, a male dummy, an AfricanAmerican dummy, the Hispanic dummy, and lastly, a marriage status dummy. We report
the estimation results in Table 5.
From the estimates reported in Table 5, the coefficients for African American
dummies are negative for the hazard scaling model specifications and positive for the
age-scaling model specifications. All coefficients indicate that African Americans are
more optimistic than White respondents. No difference exists between Hispanic and
White respondents in terms of their optimism indices. Another pattern that can be found
in all four specifications is the finding that male respondents are more optimistic than
female respondents. In addition, older respondents are generally more optimistic than
younger respondents in three specifications. The only exception is the unconstrained agescaling model where the age coefficient is insignificant. Finally, whether a person is
married does not make any difference in his/her optimism indices.
Tables 6 through 9 provide the predicted survival probabilities of four different
specifications, the stated survival probabilities, and the life table survival probabilities.
The predicted survival probabilities in the unconstrained specifications are higher than
those based on constrained specifications. This derives from the fact that the

19

unconstrained specifications produce indices that indicate more optimism than those
based on unconstrained specifications.
In Figure 1, we produce two fitted probability histograms for males and females
between the ages of 70-74 at the time the survey is conducted for the constrained hazardscaling model. The histograms for all other age groups and all other models are the same
save for their location. From this figure, all focal responses of zero and one have moved
away from zero and one. For example, for males who are between 70 – 74 years old at
the time of the survey, the predicted probabilities of surviving to age 85 are .22 and .61 if
the responses are zero and one, respectively. Figure 2 has various survival curves for both
males and females at age 70 for both constrained and unconstrained specifications in the
hazard-scaling model. Graphs based on other models at other age categories look similar.
In Figure 2, the lines personal-p=1 and personal-p=0 represent the survival curves if the
response is one and zero, respectively. The line personal-p=Average represents the
survival curve if the response represents the average of all responses. Not surprising, a
person whose response is one typically has the highest survival curve, thus demonstrating
the highest survival probabilities, while a person whose response is 0.0 has the lowest
survival curve.
The densities of prior and posterior densities are illustrated in Figure 3. The first
panel in Figure 3 shows the prior and posterior densities if the response is one, with the
posterior density lying to the right of the prior density. Similarly, in the second panel in
Figure 3, the posterior density lies to the left of the prior density if the response is zero.
This is what one would expect from the Bayesian update model. The third panel in Figure
3 illustrates a case where the response is 0.5. Finally, we produce histograms of the

20

estimated optimistic parameters γi for all four models in Figure 4. The average and
standard deviations of γi are also given in the histograms. There are significant variations
between these indices. The significant variations in optimistic indices produce significant
variations in individual survival curves.

IV. Conclusions
Many economic models are based on forward-looking behavior on the part of
economic agents. Surveys such as HRS and AHEAD ask individuals for their
expectations on the probability of given future events occurring in their lifetime. On
average, the subjective probability of a future event is consistent with the observed
probability that the event does occur. In other words, individual survival probabilities are
consistent with those from the life tables.
However, at the micro level, the subjective probability responses in HRS and
AHEAD suffer serious problems with focal responses of 0.0 and 1.0. Consequently,
applying subjective probabilities are extremely limited if “true” subjective survival
probabilities are not recovered.
In this paper, we suggest a Bayesian update model that is based on actual survival
information to account for problems caused by focal responses of 0.0 and 1.0. As a result,
individual survival curves derived from the model do not suffer the problems of focal
responses. We also propose two approaches to model the individual heterogeneities of
their subjective survival curves. One approach modifies the life table hazard rates while
another approach models the subjective aging process that is different from the life table
aging process. The model is estimated from the observed survival information of our
sample. From the estimated model, we construct several optimistic indices for each

21

individual and conduct a test that is based on out-of-sample prediction. These optimistic
are used to create individual subjective survival curves that have considerable variations
and are readily applicable to economic models that require individual subjective survival
curves. In a companion paper, we apply these individual subjective survival curves to a
life-cycle model of savings and bequests.
