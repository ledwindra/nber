    "abstract": "\n\nWe study bargaining between a fixed agenda-setter and responder over successive issues. If the responder rejects the setter\u2019s proposal, the setter can attempt to assert her will to implement her ideal and will succeed with a probability that depends on her \u201cpersonal power\u201d. Players learn about the setter\u2019s power as gridlock persists. Gridlock occurs when the setter\u2019s perceived power is either too high or too low, and the players reach compromise when the setter has moderate personal power. The presence of \u201cdifficult\u201d issues can induce more compromise as the players have incentives to avoid testing the setter\u2019s power.\n\n",
