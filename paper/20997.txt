How Does Health Promotion Work? Evidence From The Dirty Business of Eliminating Open
Defecation

ABSTRACT
We investigate the mechanisms underlying health promotion campaigns designed to eliminate open
defecation in at-scale randomized field experiments in four countries: India, Indonesia, Mali, and
Tanzania. Health promotion works through a number of mechanisms, including: providing information
on the return to better behavior, nudging better behavior that one already knows is in her self-interest,
and encouraging households to invest in health products that lower the marginal cost of good behavior.
We find that health promotion generally worked through both convincing households to invest in
in-home sanitation facilities and nudging increased use of those facilities.
We also estimate the causal relationship between village open defecation rates and child height using
experimentally induced variation in open defecation for identification. Surprisingly we find a fairly
linear relationship between village open defecation rates and the height of children less than 5 years
old. Fully eliminating open defecation from a village where everyone defecates in the open would
increase child height by 0.44 standard deviations. Hence modest to small reductions in open defecation
are unlikely to have a detectable effect on child height and explain why many health promotion interventions
designed to reduce open defecation fail to improve child height. Our results suggest that stronger interventions
that combine intensive health promotional nudges with subsidies for sanitation construction may be
needed to reduce open defecation enough to generate meaningful improvements in child health.

INTRODUCTION	  
Much	  of	  health	  status	  is	  driven	  by	  individual	  choices	  over	  diet,	  exercise,	  hygiene	  and	  risk	  

behaviors.	   	   However,	   successfully	   promoting	   healthy	   behavior	   has	   been	   notoriously	   difficult	  
because	   existing	   (unhealthy)	   behaviors	   are	   deep-­‐rooted	   habits	   that	   form	   early	   in	   life	   and	   are	  
reinforced	  by	  cultural	  and	  social	  norms.	  Small	  monetary,	  time,	  and	  hassle	  costs	  can	  be	  enough	  
to	   inhibit	   changing	   well-­‐established	   habits	   even	   if	   such	   inert	   behavior	   is	   suboptimal	   (DellaVigna	  
2009;	   Sunskind	   and	   Thaler	   2008).	   Despite	   vast	   investment	   in	   information	   and	   promotion	  
campaigns,	   large	   numbers	   of	   people	   who	   know	   better	   continue	   to	   behave	   in	   ways	   that	   are	  
detrimental	  to	  their	  long-­‐term	  health	  such	  as	  smoking,	  consuming	  too	  much	  sugar,	  not	  washing	  
their	  hands,	  substance	  abuse,	  open	  defecation,	  and	  risky	  sex.	  	  
There	   are	   two	   broad	   categories	   of	   interventions	   widely	   used	   to	   promote	   healthy	  
behavior.	   The	   first	   subsidizes	   the	   purchase	   of	   health	   products,	   such	   as	   a	   water	   filters	   and	  
insecticide	   treated	   bednets,	   that	   lowers	   the	   cost	   of	   healthy	   behavior	   and	   thereby	   makes	   the	  
behavior	  more	  convenient	  (Dupas	  2014b).1	  	   Subsidies	  for	  health	  products	  are	  typically	  justified	  
based	   on	   public	   goods	   arguments.	   Since	   the	   use	   of	   health	   products	   prevents	   parasitic	   and	  
infectious	   diseases	   that	   would	   otherwise	   spillover	  into	   other	   households,	  private	   investment	   in	  
health	   products	   is	   likely	   socially	   suboptimal.	   In	   addition,	   when	   the	   majority	   of	   the	   population	   is	  
cash	   and	   credit	   constrained,	   subsidies	   may	   be	   needed	   to	   ensure	   the	   widespread	   adoption	  
needed	  to	  prevent	  spillover.	  	  
The	  second	  category	  is	  health	  promotion	  campaigns	  aimed	  at	  behavioral	  change.	  These	  
campaigns	   are	   the	   mainstay	   of	   public	   health	   interventions	   and	   typically	   combine	   information	  
messaging	   with	   nudges	   such	   as	   helping	   develop	   specific	   plans,	   reminders,	   commitment	   devices

	  A	  number	  of	  studies	  have	  looked	  at	  the	  effect	  of	  subsidies	  on	  take-­‐up	  of	  health	  products	  and	  effect	  of	  having	  
health	  products	  on	  behavior.	  For	  example,	  subsidies	  increase	  the	  uptake	  of	  toilets	  (Pattanayak	  et	  al.,	  2009).	  Having	  
soap	  and	  hot	  water	  in	  the	  house	  lowers	  the	  cost	  of	  hand	  washing	  (Luby	  et	  al.	  2004,	  Galiani	  et	  al	  2014).	  	  Storing	  
condoms	  on	  site	  lowers	  the	  cost	  of	  safe	  sex	  (Gertler	  et	  al	  2005).	  	  Owning	  a	  bednet	  already	  treated	  with	  insecticide	  
lowers	  the	  cost	  of	  malaria	  prevention	  (Cohen	  and	  Dupas	  2010,	  Cohen	  et	  al	  2014,	  Dupas	  2014a,	  Tarozzi	  et	  al.,	  
2014).	  	  Dispensing	  chlorine	  tablets	  at	  public	  water	  sources	  lowers	  the	  cost	  of	  accessing	  clean	  water	  (Ahuja	  et	  al,	  
2010).	  Owning	  a	  clean	  cook	  stove	  lowers	  the	  cost	  of	  reducing	  indoor	  air	  pollution	  (Bensch	  and	  Peters	  2012,	  Levine	  
et	  al.	  2013).

and	   financial	   incentives	   (e.g.	   Ashraf	   et	   al.,	   2006,	   Thaler	   and	   Sunstein,	   2008,	   Giné	   et	   al.,	   2010,	  
Karlan	   et	   al,	   2012,	   Dupas	   and	   Robinson	   2013).	   	   Examples	   include	  campaigns	   to	   reduce	   smoking	  
and	  substance	  abuse	  cessation,	  as	  well	  as	  to	  improve	  nutrition	  and	  exercise,	  hygiene,	  safe	  sex,	  
etc.	   Health	   promotion	   campaigns	   work	   through	   a	   number	   of	   mechanisms	   including	   providing	  
information	  on	  the	  return	  to	  the	  behavior,	  nudging	  better	  behavior	  that	  one	  already	  knows	  is	  in	  
her	   self-­‐interest,	   and	   encouraging	   households	   to	   invest	   in	   health	   products	   that	   lower	   the	  
marginal	  cost	  of	  good	  behavior.	  	  	  
The	   two	   approaches	   are	   based	   on	   very	   different	   views	   of	   the	   world.	   The	   subsidy	  
approach	   argues	   that	   households	   want	   to	   engage	   in	   the	   healthy	   behavior	   but	   are	   liquidity-­‐
constrained	   so	   that	   they	   are	   not	   able	   to	   invest	   in	   the	   health	   products	   necessary	   to	   make	   the	  
behavior	  convenient.	  Under	  this	  paradigm,	  once	  the	  family	  has	  invested	  in	  the	  health	  product,	  
the	   lower	   cost	   of	   the	   healthy	   behavior	   will	   facilitate	   the	   desired	   change	   in	   behavior.	   	   In	  
contrast,	   the	   health	   promotion	   approach	   considers	   that	   even	   if	   the	   behavior	   is	   convenient,	  
individuals	  will	  only	  engage	  in	  the	  behavior	  if	  one	  can	  change	  deep-­‐rooted	  habits	  and	  counter	  
prevailing	   social	   norms.	   If	   the	   primary	   mechanism	   through	   which	   health	   promotion	   works	   is	  
through	   encouraging	   investment	   in	   health	   products	   as	   opposed	   to	   overcoming	   norms	   and	  
habits,	  then	  it	  may	  be	  more	  effective	  to	  simply	  subsidize	  the	  purchase	  of	  products,	  especially	  in	  
the	   liquidity	   constrained	   cases	   where	   health	   promotion	   has	   limited	   effect	   on	   investment.	  
However	   in	   cases	   where	   health	   product	   subsidies	   are	   not	   enough,	   behavioral	   change	  
interventions	  may	  also	  be	  necessary	  and	  vice	  versa.	  
In	   this	   paper	   we	   report	   on	   the	   effects	   and	   mechanisms	   (behavioral	   change	   versus	  
investment)	  of	  health	  promotion	  campaigns	  designed	  to	  eliminate	  open	  defecation	  in	  at-­‐scale	  
randomized	   field	   experiments	   from	   four	   countries:	   India,	   Indonesia,	   Mali,	   and	   Tanzania.	   The	  
field	   experiments	   are	   at-­‐scale	   in	   the	   sense	   that	   the	   interventions	   were	   designed	   and	  
implemented	   by	   governments	   as	   part	   of	   their	   national	   environmental	   health	   strategies,	   and	  
randomly	  rolled	  out	  geographically	  over	  time.	  The	  combination	  of	  at-­‐scale	  cluster	  randomized	  
field	  experiments	  with	  common	  measurement	  of	  outcomes	  in	  four	  countries	  provides	  not	  only	  
strong	  internal	  validity	  but	  also	  a	  degree	  of	  external	  validity	  not	  seen	  in	  most	  studies.

Open	   defecation	   (OD)	   is	   thought	   to	   be	   a	   major	   cause	   of	   the	   persistent	   worldwide	  
burden	  of	  diarrhea	  and	  enteric	  parasite	  infection	  among	  children	  under	  5	  years	  old	  (Mara	  et	  al.,	  
2010).	   	   Open	   defecation	   can	   lead	  to	   the	   fecal	   contamination	   of	   water	   and	   food	   supplies	   and	   to	  
the	   transmission	   of	   soil-­‐borne	   helminthes	   (Chavasse	   et	   al.,	   1999).	   Reducing	   open	   defecation	  
requires	  access	  to	  and	  use	  of	  improved	  sanitation	  facilities,	  which	  are	  defined	  as	  facilities	  that	  
prevent	  human	  feces	  from	  re-­‐entering	  the	  environment.	  In	  2010,	  47%	  of	  the	  world	  population	  
did	  not	  have	  access	  to	  onsite	  improved	  sanitation	  facilities	  (UNICEF-­‐WHO,	  2012).	  Observational	  
studies	   of	   interventions	   that	   prevent	   human	   feces	   from	   entering	   the	   environment	   have	   been	  
shown	   to	   reduce	   diarrheal	   disease	   (Clasen	   et	   al.,	   2010,	   Norman	   et	   al.,	   2010),	   enteric	   parasite	  
infections	   (Barreto	   et	   al.,	   2010,	   Ziegelbauer	   et	   al.,	   2012),	   and	   child	   stunting	   and	   mortality	  
(Checkley	  et	  al.	  2004	  and	  2008,	  Humphrey	  2009,	  and	  Spears	  2012).	  	  
Given	   the	   large	   externalities	   associated	   with	   open	   defecation,	   families	   are	   only	   fully	  
protected	  if	  both	  they	  and	  their	  neighbors	  have	  access	  to	  and	  use	  improved	  sanitation	  facilities.	  
This	   has	   led	   to	   interventions	   that	   focus	   on	   the	   open	   defecation	   practices	   of	   the	   community,	  
rather	   than	   solely	   of	   the	   household.	   The	   most	   popular	   intervention	   is	   Community-­‐Led	   Total	  
Sanitation	   (CLTS),	   which	   informs	   communities	   and	   helps	   them	   to	   develop	   plans	   and	  
commitments	  to	  become	  100%	  open	  defecation	  free	  (Kar	  and	  Pasteur	  2005;	  Kar	  and	  Chambers,	  
2008).	   CLTS	   is	   intended	   to	   be	   participatory	   in	   nature	   and	   facilitates	   communities	   to	   take	   a	  
decisive	   role	   in	   ensuring	   that	   each	   and	   every	   member	   internalizes	   the	   implication	   of	   open	  
defecation	   (Sah	   &	   Negussie,	   2008).	   Pioneered	   in	   Bangladesh	   in	   1999,	   CLTS	   has	   been	  
implemented	   throughout	   Asia,	   Latin	   America,	   and	   Sub-­‐Saharan	   Africa	   (Wells	   and	   Sijbesma,	  
2012).	  Despite	  this,	  a	  number	  of	  recent	  experimental	  reduced	  form	  studies	  have	  found	  mixed	  
results	   on	   the	   impact	   of	   CLTS	   on	   child	   health	   outcomes	   (Clausen	   et	   al.	   2014;	   Dickerson	   et	   al.	  
2014;	  Hammer	  and	  Spears	  2103;	  Patil	  et	  al.	  2014;	  and	  Wells	  and	  Sijbesma,	  2012).	  	  
While	  CLTS	  was	  the	  common	  core	  intervention	  in	  all	  four	  countries	  under	  study	  in	  this	  
paper,	   there	   were	   a	   number	   of	   important	   variations	   and	   additions.	   Indonesia,	   India,	   and	  
Tanzania	   additionally	   strengthened	   the	   private	   market	   availability	   of	   trained	   masons	   and	  
construction	  materials.	  The	  World	  Bank	  refers	  to	  the	  combined	  CLTS	  and	  strengthened	  private	  
sanitation	   market	   approach	   as	   Total	   Sanitation	   and	   Sanitation	   Marketing	   (TSSM)	   campaigns.

India’s	  Total	  Sanitation	  Campaign	  (TSC)	  combined	  TSSM	  with	   additional	  subsidies	  for	  private	  in-­‐
home	  sanitation	  construction	  (toilet	  or	  latrine).	  While	  Mali	  was	  a	  pure	  CLTS	  intervention,	  it	  was	  
much	   more	   intensive	   than	   in	   the	   other	   countries,	   as	   they	   conducted	   12	   monthly	   visits	  
compared	  to	  the	  usual	  initial	  visit	  plus	  one	  follow-­‐up.	  The	  interventions	  are	  described	  in	  greater	  
detail	  in	  Section	  2.	  
The	  data	  used	  in	  this	  paper	  are	  generated	  from	  cluster-­‐randomized	  interventions	  in	  all	  
four	   countries,	   where	   the	   unit	   of	   randomization	   is	   the	   village.	   In	   general,	   the	   samples	   for	   all	  
four	   countries	   are	   well	   balanced	   at	   baseline,	   have	   low	   levels	   of	   attrition,	   and	   show	   little	  
evidence	  of	  attrition	  bias.	  The	  details	  of	  the	  random	  assignment	  and	   sample	  are	  summarized	  in	  
Table	  1	  and	  discussed	  in	  detail	  in	  the	  data	  appendix.	  
In	   Section	   3	   we	   derive	   an	   expression	   that	   decomposes	   the	   reduced	   form	   program	  
impact	   on	   open	   defecation	   into	   three	   terms:	   (1)	   investment	   in	   private	   in-­‐home	   sanitation	  
facilities,	   (2)	   change	   in	   the	   open	   defecation	   behavior	   of	   families	   that	   have	   private	   in-­‐home	  
sanitation	  faculties,	  and	  (2)	  change	  in	  the	  behavior	  of	  families	  that	  do	  not	  have	  private	  in-­‐home	  
sanitation	   faculties	   and	   must	   use	   shared	   facilities.	   We	   then	   use	   the	   data	   from	   the	   field	  
experiments	  to	  estimate	  each	  of	  the	  terms	  in	  the	  decomposition.	  
The	   results	   suggest	   that	   the	   health	   promotion	   interventions	   produced	   significant	  
reductions	   in	  household	   and	   village	  open	   defecation	  rates	   in	   all	   four	   countries	  -­‐-­‐	   but	   to	   varying	  
degrees.	  The	  Mali	  intervention	  saw	  the	  largest	  reduction	  in	  open	  defecation;	  close	  to	  3-­‐times	  
the	   reduction	   of	   the	   next	   closest	   country.	   Moreover,	   Mali	   is	   the	   only	   country	   in	   which	   the	  
intervention	   succeeded	   in	   reducing	   open	   defecation	   by	   both	   households	   that	   did	   and	  
households	  that	  did	  not	  have	  private	  in-­‐home	  sanitation	  facilities	  at	  baseline.	  In	  the	  other	  three	  
countries,	  all	  of	  the	  behavioral	  change	  (reductions	  in	  open	  defecation)	  occurred	  exclusively	  in	  
the	   households	   that	   did	   not	   have	   private	   sanitation	   facilities	   at	   baseline.	   	   The	   more	   effective	  
results	   in	   Mali	   are	   likely	   due	   to	   the	   much	   more	   intensive	   CLTS	   intervention	   compared	   to	   the	  
other	  countries.	  	  
In	  Indonesia,	  Mali,	  and	  Tanzania,	  the	  health	  promotion	  campaigns	  worked	  both	  through	  
getting	  households	  to	  invest	  in	  in-­‐home	  private	  sanitation	  facilities	  and	  through	  increased	  use	  
5	  	  
	  

	  

of	  private	  and	  shared	  sanitation	  facilities.	  However,	  in	  India,	  which	  combined	  a	  very	  light	  CLTS	  
with	  large	  subsidies	  for	  sanitation	  facility	  construction,	  all	  of	  the	  reduction	  in	  open	  defecation	  
was	   through	   the	   investment	   channel.	   Interestingly,	   households	   used	   new	   private	   in-­‐home	  
sanitation	  facilities	  less	  in	  countries	  where	  they	  were	  induced	  to	  build	  through	  the	  behavioral	  
change	   components	   of	   CLTS	   (i.e.	   Indonesia,	   Mali,	   and	   Tanzania)	   compared	   to	   India,	   where	   they	  
were	  induced	  to	  build	  through	  subsidies.	  	  
In	  Section	  4,	  we	  use	  experimentally	  induced	  variation	  in	  village	  OD	  rates	  to	  identify	  the	  
causal	  relationship	  between	  OD	  and	  child	  height.	  Surprisingly	  we	  find	  a	  fairly	  linear	  relationship.	  
We	  estimate	  that	  fully	  eliminating	  open	  defecation	  from	  a	  village	  where	  everyone	  defecates	  in	  
the	   open	   would	   increase	   child	   height	   by	   0.44	   standard	   deviations.	   Hence	   modest	   to	   small	  
reductions	   in	   open	   defecation	   are	   unlikely	   to	   have	   a	   significant	   effect	   on	   child	   height	   and	  
explain	   why	  many	  health	  promotion	  interventions	  designed	  to	  reduce	  open	  defecation	  fail	   to	  
improve	   child	   height.	   Our	   results	   suggest	   that	   stronger	   interventions	   that	   combine	   intensive	  
health	  promotional	  nudges	  with	  subsidies	  for	  sanitation	  construction	  may	  be	  needed	  to	  reduce	  
open	  defecation	  enough	  to	  generate	  meaningful	  improvements	  in	  child	  health.	  
In	  the	  final	  section	  we	  use	  the	  results	  from	  the	  decomposition	  analysis	  to	  discuss	  how	  
interventions	   might	   be	   constructed	   to	   achieve	   large	   enough	   reductions	   in	   village	   open	  
defecation	  to	  generate	  meaningful	  improvements	  in	  child	  health.	  By	  far	  the	  biggest	  reductions	  
in	   open	   defecation	   come	   from	   households	   constructing	   private	   sanitation	   facilities.	   	   Installing	  
private	   sanitation	   has	   a	   much	   larger	   effect	   on	   open	   household	   defecation	   than	   any	   of	   the	  
behavioral	  change	  pathways.	  However,	  the	  effect	  on	  village	  open	  defection	  rates	  depends	  on	  
existing	   village-­‐level	   private	   sanitation	   coverage.	   Households	   may	   need	   substantial	   subsidies	  
and	  the	  effect	  of	  subsidies	  on	  village	  private	  sanitation	  coverage	  depends	  on	  the	  price	  elasticity	  
of	   demand.	   	   Even	   with	   very	   large	   subsidies,	   the	   evidence	   suggests	   that	   subsidizing	   private	  
sanitation	   construction	   by	   itself	   will	   not	   achieve	   sufficient	   reductions	   in	   village-­‐level	   open	  
defection	   rates	   to	   be	   able	   to	   produce	   meaningful	   improvements	   in	   health	   outcomes.	   However,	  
it	   might	   be	   possible	   to	   achieve	   such	   levels	   by	   combining	   the	   intensive	   CLTS	   Mali	   model	   with	  
subsidies.

INTERVENTIONS	  
The	   core	   intervention	   in	   all	   four	   countries	   was	   CLTS.2	  	   CLTS	   programs	   are	   community-­‐

targeted	   and	   community-­‐driven	   participatory	   campaigns	   designed	   to	   promote	   and	   improve	  
sanitation	   practices	   in	   rural	   areas	   (Kar	   and	   Chambers,	   2008).	   External	   facilitators	   are	   sent	   to	  
villages	   for	   a	   few	   days	   to	   lead	   graphic	   discussions	   of	   the	   community’s	   current	   sanitation	  
practices,	   the	   health	   consequences	   of	   such	   practices,	   and	  to	   facilitate	   collective	   action	   plans	   to	  
eliminate	   open	   defecation.	   The	   facilitated	   discussions	   are	   held	   in	   public	   places	   and	   are	   open	   to	  
all	  community	  members.	  They	  involve	  a	  “walk	  of	  shame,”	  where	  villagers	  are	  asked	  to	  provide	  a	  
tour	   indicating	   where	   people	   defecate.	   A	   map	   of	   the	   village	   is	   drawn	   on	   the	   ground	   and	  
villagers	  are	  asked	  to	  indicate	  where	  they	  live,	  where	  they	  defecate,	  and	  the	  routes	  they	  take	  
there	  and	  back.	  The	  facilitator	  then	  helps	  people	  analyze	  how	  fecal	  contamination	  is	  spreading	  
from	   the	   exposed	   excreta	   to	   their	   living	   environments	   and	   food	   and	   drinking	   water.	   It	   soon	  
becomes	   apparent	   that	   everyone	   is	   ingesting	   small	   amounts	   of	   each	   other’s	   feces.	   The	   premise	  
underlying	  the	  program	  approach	  is	  that	  this	  process	  prompts	  feelings	  of	  disgust	  that	  leads	  to	  
personal	  and	  collective	  desire	  to	  solve	  the	  problem	  with	  the	  ultimate	  aim	  of	  becoming	  an	  Open	  
Defecation	  Free	  (ODF)	  community.	  The	  community	  then	  is	  on	  its	  own	  to	  forge	  its	  own	  plan	  of	  
action	   with,	   at	   best,	   limited	   support	   from	   the	   program.	   	   The	   external	   facilitators	   somtimes	  
continue	   make	   followup	   visits	   to	   keep	   the	   community	   motivated	   and	   monitor	   their	   progress	   to	  
become	  the	  ODF	  community.	  
One	  of	  the	  key	  aspects	  of	  CLTS	  is	  to	  encourage	  households	  in	  the	  community	  to	  build	  
and	   use	   sanitation	   facilities	   that	   prevent	   fecal	   matter	   from	   re-­‐entering	   the	   environment	   and	  
flies	   from	   transmitting	   pathogens	   from	   the	   fecal	   matter	   to	   food	   and	   water	   that	   are	   later	  
ingested.	  While	  CLTS	  derived	  solutions	  could	  involve	  building	  shared	  toilets	  or	  public	  toilets,	  in	  
practice	  the	  main	  outcome	  has	  been	  to	  construct	  private	  in-­‐home,	  water-­‐flushed	  squat	  toilets	  
with	   drainage	   to	   a	   sealed	   pit.	   Households	   and	   communities	   are	   typically	   left	   to	   their	   own

devices	  to	  finance	  and	  implement	  the	  construction	  of	  these	  facilities,	  as	  CLTS	  by	  itself	  typically	  
does	  not	  provide	  resources	  for	  this	  purpose.	  
While	   CLTS	   was	   the	   common	   intervention,	   there	   were	   a	   number	   of	   differences	   across	  
the	  four	  countries	  (See	  Table	  2).	  Indonesia,	  India,	  and	  Tanzania	  also	  included	  capacity	  building	  
of	   sanitation	   entrepreneurs	   in	   order	   to	   insure	   that	   households	   who	   want	   to	   build	   private	   in-­‐
home	   sanitation	   faculties	   are	   able	   to	   purchase	   the	   materials	   (i.e.	   cement)	   and	   hire	   trained	  
masons	   to	   assist	   in	   the	   construction	   (supply	   side).	   	   India	   additionally	   provided	   monetary	  
subsidies	   to	   households	   for	   the	   construction	   of	   private	   in-­‐home	   sanitation	   facilities	   (demand	  
side).	   The	   amount	   of	   the	   Indian	   subsidy	   depends	   on	   whether	   a	   household	   was	   defined	   to	   be	  
Below	   Poverty	   Line	   (BPL)	   or	   Above	   the	   Poverty	   Line	   (APL).	   The	   program	   provided	   materials	   and	  
cash	   of	   Rs	   4200	   to	   Rs4700	   (US	   $84	   to	   $144)	   to	   BPL	   households	   and	   Rs	   2000	   to	   Rs	   5000	   (US	   $40	  
to	  $100)	  to	  non-­‐BPL	  households	  to	  support	  toilet	  construction.	  	  Finally,	  there	  were	  substantial	  
differences	   in	   the	   intensity	   of	   the	   CLTS.	   In	   Mali,	   facilitators	   visited	   communities	   first	   for	   CLTS	  
triggering	  and	   then	   monthly	   for	   one	   year	   to	   monitor	   activities	   and	   reinforce	   CLTS	   messaging.	   In	  
contrast,	  in	  Indonesia	  and	  Tanzania	  facilitators	  visited	  the	  communities	  only	  twice,	  once	  for	  a	  
triggering	   visit	   with	   a	   second	   follow-­‐up	   visit	   shortly	   thereafter	   to	   reinforce	   CLTS	   messaging.	  
India	  had	  the	  lightest	  CLTS	  intensity	  with	  only	  one	  visit	  for	  triggering	  and	  almost	  no	  follow-­‐up.	  
Compliance	  with	  the	  experimental	  design	  was	  not	  perfect	  (Table	  1).	  In	  Indonesia,	  only	  
66%	  of	  the	  villages	  assigned	  to	  treatment	  were	  triggered	  through	  CLTS	  activities	  (compliance),	  
while	   14%	   assigned	   to	   the	   control	   group	   also	   received	   the	   intervention	   (contamination).	  
Similarly,	   25%	   of	   the	   villages	   in	   India	   and	   10%	   in	   Mali	   assigned	   to	   the	   control	   group	   received	  
treatment.	   	   In	   the	   analyses	   below,	   we	   compare	   the	   outcomes	   of	   the	   group	   assigned	   to	  
treatment	  to	  the	  group	  assigned	  to	  control	  and	  therefore	  the	  results	  are	  interpreted	  as	  intent-­‐
to-­‐treat	  estimates.

OPEN	  DEFECATION	  
In	   this	   section	   we	   lay	   out	   a	   framework	   that	   decomposes	   the	   impact	   of	   a	   health	  

promotion	  intervention	  on	  OD	  into	  the	  contributions	  of	  behavioral	  and	  investment	  pathways.

We	  then	  estimate	  the	  parameters	  of	  the	  decomposition	  and	  use	  those	  estimates	  to	  assess	  the	  
relative	  contribution	  of	  each	  pathway.	  	  
3.1

Conceptual	  Framework	  

We	   begin	   by	   noting	   that	   an	   intervention	   differentially	   affects	   those	   households	   that	  
have	  and	  those	  that	  do	  not	  have	  existing	  private	  in-­‐home	  sanitation	  facilities.	  For	  households	  
that	   have	   existing	   private	   sanitation	   facilities	   in	   their	   house,	   the	   only	   pathway	   is	   through	  
behavioral	   change,	   i.e.	   increased	   use	   of	   those	   facilities.	   In	   the	   case	   of	   families	   that	   do	   not	   have	  
existing	   private	   in-­‐home	   sanitation,	   an	   intervention	   can	   increase	   the	   use	   of	   shared	   (public	   or	  
private)	  facilities	  outside	  the	  house	  or	  cause	  households	  to	  invest	  in	  private	  in-­‐home	  sanitation.	  
The	  investment	  reduces	  the	  time	  and	  hassle	  or	  “transaction”	  cost	  of	  using	  sanitation	  facilities,	  
thereby	  increasing	  use	  of	  sanitation	  facilities.	  	  
We	  formalize	  this	  discussion	  as	  follows.	  Let	  𝜋 𝑂𝐷   be	  the	  probability	  of	  open	  defecation	  
and	  𝜋 𝑆 	  be	  the	  probability	  of	  having	  private	  in-­‐home	  sanitation	  facilities.	  	  Then	  the	  probability	  
of	  open	  defecation	  can	  be	  written	  as	  the	  weighted	  sum	  of	  the	  conditional	  OD	  probabilities	  of	  
those	  with	  and	  without	  private	  in-­‐home	  sanitation	  facilities:	  
	  

𝜋 𝑂𝐷 = 𝜋 𝑂𝐷 𝑆 = 1 𝜋 𝑆 + 𝜋 0𝐷 𝑆 = 0 1 − 𝜋 𝑆 	  	  	   .	  

	  

(1)	  
	  
In	   (1),	  𝜋 𝑂𝐷 𝑆 = 1 	  is	   the	   probability	   of	   OD	   conditional	   on	   having	   private	   in-­‐home	   sanitation	  
facilities,	  and	  𝜋 𝑂𝐷 𝑆 = 0 	  is	  the	  probability	  of	  OD	  conditional	  on	  not	  having	  private	  in-­‐home	  
sanitation	  facilities.	  
We	  obtain	  an	  expression	  of	  the	  pathways	  through	  which	  an	  intervention	  affects	  OD	  by	  
totally	  differentiating	  (1)	  and	  collecting	  terms:	  
	  

𝑑𝜋 𝑂𝐷 = 𝑑𝜋 𝑂𝐷 𝑆 = 1 𝜋 𝑆 + 𝑑𝜋 𝑂𝐷 𝑆 = 0 1 − 𝜋 𝑆

+	  

	  
𝑑𝜋 𝑆 𝜋 𝑂𝐷 𝑆 = 1 − 𝜋 𝑂𝐷 𝑆 = 0 	  	  	  
	  	  
.	  
(2)	  	  	  	  	  
	  
The	  change	  in	  the	  OD	  rate,	  then,	  is	  the	  weighted	  sum	  of	  the	  change	  in	  OD	  of	  those	  that	  have	  
private	  sanitation	  and	  those	  that	  do	  not	  have	  private	  sanitation,	  plus	  the	  change	  in	  the	  share	  
that	   have	   private	   sanitation,	   times	   the	   difference	   in	   OD	   of	   those	   that	   do	   and	   do	   not	   have

private	   sanitation.	   The	   first	   two	   terms	   are	   the	   behavioral	   pathways	   and	   the	   third	   term	   is	   the	  
investment	  in	  reducing	  the	  cost	  of	  access	  to	  sanitation	  facilities.	  	  	  
We	  convert	  the	  decomposition	  into	  the	  share	  of	  the	  total	  change	  in	  OD	  accounted	  for	  
each	  of	  the	  three	  pathways	  by	  dividing	  both	  sides	  of	  (2)	  by	  𝑑𝜋 𝑂𝐷 :

We	   obtain	   𝑑𝜋 𝑂𝐷 and  𝑑𝜋 𝑂𝐷 𝑆 = 1    in	   equation	   (2)	   by	   estimating	   the	   following	  
regression	  for	  all	  households,	  and	  for	  households	  that	  have	  existing	  private	  in-­‐home	  sanitation	  
facilities	  at	  baseline	  respectively:

where	  𝑂𝐷!"# 	  is	  the	  OD	  rate	  of	  household	  i	  in	  village	  j	  in	  randomization	  strata	  k,	  𝑇! 	  takes	  on	  the	  
value	  one	  if	  village	  j	  in	  randomization	  strata	  k	  was	  assigned	  to	  treatment,	  and	  𝑅! 	  takes	  on	  the

The	  parameters	  in	  (3)	  are	  identified	  off	  the	  random	  assignment	  using	  the	  endline	  data.

that	   do	   not	   have	   private	   facilities	   (Appendix	   Tables	   A1-­‐A4).	   The	   estimates	   are	   intent-­‐to-­‐treat	  
(ITT)	   parameters	   that	   compare	   the	   outcomes	   of	   households	   in	   those	   villages	   to	   which	   the	  
program	  was	  assigned	  to	  be	  offered	  with	  control	  villages	  that	  were	  assigned	  not	  to	  be	  offered	  
the	  program.	  We	  cluster	  the	  standard	  errors	  at	  the	  village	  level.	  
The	  dependent	  variable	  is	  an	  intensity	  measure	  of	  open	  defecation.	  The	  household	  was	  
asked	   separately	   for	   men,	   women,	   and	   children	   if	   they	   defecated	   in	   the	   open	   always,	  
sometimes,	  or	  never.	  	  We	  coded	  the	  answers	  2	  for	  always,	  1	  for	  sometimes,	  and	  0	  for	  never.

We	  then	  summed	  the	  answers	  for	  the	  3	  types	  of	  household	  members.	  The	  values	  ranged	  from	  
0	  to	  6.	  	  We	  then	  divided	  by	  6	  in	  order	  to	  obtain	  a	  measure	  of	  OD	  intensity	  between	  0	  and	  1,	  
where	  0	  indicates	  no	  open	  defecation	  and	  1	  indicates	  always	  open	  defecate.	  	  
Table	   3	   presents	   the	   estimates	   of	   the	   impact	   of	   the	   program	   on	   households’	   defecation	  
behavior	   for	   Indonesia,	  India,	   Mali,	   and	   Tanzania.	  The	   first	   column	   reports	   estimates	   of	  𝑑𝜋 𝐷 ,	  
the	  impact	  of	  treatment	  on	  open	  defecation	  for	  all	  households.	  We	  find	  negative	  effects	  in	  all	  
four	   countries,	   of	   which	   three	   are	   statistically	   significant	   at	   conventional	   levels.	   The	   largest	  
effects	  are	  in	  Mali	  where	  the	  CLTS	  nudging	  was	  the	  most	  intensive.	  There	  we	  find	  that	  the	  OD	  
rate	   fell	   by	   0.33,	   which,	   when	   compared	   to	   the	   control	   group	   means,	   amounts	   to	   a	   58%	  
reduction	  in	  overall	  OD.	  	  Next	  highest	  is	  Tanzania	  where	  OD	  rates	  fell	  by	  0.13,	  a	  54%	  reduction	  
in	  OD	  compared	  to	  the	  control	  group.	  	  The	  relative	  effects	  in	  Mali	  and	  Tanzania	  are	  about	  the	  
same	  because	  the	  OD	  rate	  in	  the	  control	  group	  in	  Tanzania	  (0.23)	  is	  less	  than	  half	  of	  that	  in	  Mali	  
(0.57).	  	  In	  India	  and	  Indonesia	  the	  effects	  sizes	  are	  substantially	  smaller	  at	  less	  than	  10%.	  
In	  the	  second	  column	  of	  Table	  3	  we	  report	  the	  results	  for	  the	  sample	  of	  households	  that	  
had	  private	  in-­‐home	  sanitation	  at	  baseline,	  which	  provides	  us	  with	  estimates	  of	  𝑑𝜋 𝑂𝐷 𝑆 = 1 .	  
In	   3	   out	   of	   the	   4	   countries,	   there	   was	   effectively	   no	   impact	   of	   treatment	   on	   the	   OD	   rates	   of	  
households	  that	  had	  existing	  in-­‐home	  private	  sanitation	  faculties.	  	  In	  Indonesia	  and	  Tanzania,	  
this	  effect	  is	  most	  likely	  driven	  by	  the	  very	  low	  OD	  rates	  among	  these	  households	  to	  begin	  with.	  
However,	  the	  OD	  rates	  among	  households	  with	  existing	  private	  sanitation	  are	  nontrivial	  in	  India	  
and	  Mali.	  While	  treatment	  had	  a	  large	  negative	  effect	   on	  this	  group	   in	  Mali,	  it	  had	  no	  impact	  in	  
India.	   This	   is	   consistent	   with	   the	   more	   intensive	   behavioral	   change	   intervention	   in	   Mali	  
compared	  to	  India.	  
Finally,	  in	  the	  last	  column	  we	  report	  estimates	  for	  those	  households	  that	  did	  not	  have	  
private	   in-­‐home	   sanitation	   facilities	   at	   baseline.	   	   These	   estimates	   are	   a	   combination	   of	   the	  
investment	  effect	  and	  the	  increased	  use	  of	  shared	  non-­‐private	  sanitation	  facilities	  among	  those	  
who	  chose	  not	  to	  construct.	  While	  not	  providing	  information	  for	  the	  decomposition	  in	  equation	  
(2),	  the	  results	  are	  interesting	  because,	  except	  for	  Mali,	  almost	  all	  of	  the	  overall	  reduction	  in	  OD	  
comes	   from	   these	   households.	   In	   all	   countries,	   the	   estimated	   treatment	   effects	   are	  
substantially	  larger	  than	  those	  for	  households	  with	  existing	  private	  in-­‐home	  sanitation	  facilities.

The	  treatment	  effect	  on	  households	  with	  no	  private	  sanitation	  is	  a	  reduction	  in	  open	  defecation	  
by	  10%	  in	  Indonesia,	  8%	  in	  India,	  57%	  in	  Mali,	  and	  45%	  in	  Tanzania.

Investment	  in	  Sanitation	  Facilities	  	  

We	   obtain	   𝑑𝜋 𝑆   from	   the	   following	   regression	   specification	   using	   endline	   data	   for	  
households	  that	  did	  not	  have	  existing	  private	  in-­‐home	  sanitation	  facilities	  at	  baseline:

(4)	  

	  
	  
where	  𝑆!"# 	  takes	  on	  the	  value	  1	  if	  household	  i	  in	  village	  j	  in	  randomization	  strata	  k	  has	  access	  to	  
sanitation	   facilities	   at	   endline.	   We	   consider	   three	   sanitation	   outcomes	   including	   (i)	   access	   to	  
any	   sanitation	   facilities,	   (ii)	   access	   to	   private	   in-­‐home	   facilities	   and	   (iii)	   access	   to	   shared	   or	  
public	   facilities	   outside	   the	   home.	   The	   estimate	  𝑑𝜋 𝑆   is	   the	   impact	   of	   treatment	   on	   private	   in-­‐
home	   facilities.	   Again,	   the	   estimates	   in	   (4)	   are	   identified	   off	   the	   random	   assignment	   for	   the	  
sample	   of	   households	   that	   did	   not	   have	   private	   in-­‐home	   sanitation	   facilities	   at	   baseline,	   are	  
intent-­‐to-­‐treat	  (ITT)	  parameters,	  and	  the	  standard	  errors	  are	  clustered	  at	  the	  village	  level.	  
The	  first	  column	  of	  Table	  4	  reports	  estimates	  the	  impact	  of	  treatment	  on	  access	  to	  any	  
sanitation	  facilities.	  	  We	  see	  statistically	  significant	  positive	  effects	  in	  all	  4	  countries.	  Again,	  the	  
largest	  impact	  is	  in	  Mali	  where	  sanitation	  access	  increased	  by	  39	  percentage	  points,	  an	  increase	  
of	  267%	  over	  the	  control	  group.	  	  The	  next	  highest	  impact	  was	  in	  India	  where	  access	  increased	  
by	  21	  percentage	  points,	  an	  increase	  of	  166%	  over	  the	  control	  group.	  	  The	  impacts	  of	  treatment	  
on	  access	  in	  Indonesia	  and	  Tanzania	  were	  more	  modest	  amounting	  to	  47%	  and	  19%	  increases,	  
respectively.	   	   Except	   in	   Indonesia,	   all	   of	   the	   increases	   in	   access	   to	   sanitation	   came	   through	  
construction	  of	  private	  in-­‐home	  sanitation	  facilities.	  In	  Indonesia	  about	  half	  of	  the	  increase	  in	  
sanitation	  access	  came	  from	  expanded	  use	  of	  shared	  out-­‐of-­‐home	  facilities.

Behavioral	  Change	  Without	  Existing	  Private	  In-­‐Home	  Sanitation	  

Finally,	  we	  turn	  to	  estimating	  the	  remaining	  two	  parameters	  associated	  with	  those	  that	  
did	   not	   have	   private	   in-­‐home	   sanitation	   facilities	   at	   baseline.	   The	   first,	  𝑑𝜋 𝑂𝐷 𝑆 = 0 ,	   is	   the	  
impact	   of	   treatment	   on	   the	   use	   of	   shared	   out-­‐of-­‐home	   facilities,	   and	   the	   second,	  

12	  
	  
	  

	  

𝜋 𝑂𝐷 𝑆 = 1 − 𝜋 𝑂𝐷 𝑆 = 0 ,	  is	  the	  impact	  of	  installing	  private	  in-­‐home	  sanitation	  facilities	  
on	  OD.	  	  	  
We	   estimate	   these	   parameters	   using	   the	   regression	   specified	   below	   for	   the	   sample	  
households	  that	  did	  not	  have	  private	  in-­‐home	  sanitation	  facilities	  at	  baseline:3	  
	  

𝑂𝐷!"# = 𝜆! + 𝜆! 𝑇! + 𝜆! 𝑆! + 𝜆! 𝑇! 𝑆! + ! 𝛾! 𝑅! + 𝜀!"# 	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  (5)	  
	  
where	  𝑆! 	  is	  an	  indicator	  of	  having	  private	  in-­‐home	  sanitation	  facilities	  at	  endline.	  The	  coefficient	  
on	   treatment,	  𝜆! ,	   is	   an	   estimate	   of	   the	   difference	   in	   OD	   of	   families	   that	   do	   not	   have	   private	   in-­‐
home	   sanitation	   facilities	   in	   treatment	   versus	   control	   communities	   and	   is	   our	   estimate	   of	  
𝑑𝜋 𝑂𝐷 𝑆 = 0 .	  The	  coefficient	  on	  𝑆! ,	  𝜆! ,	  is	  an	  estimate	  of	  the	  difference	  in	  OD	  of	  families	  that	  
build	  sanitation	  facilities	  to	  those	  that	  do	  not	  in	  control	  communities.	  And	  the	  coefficient	  on	  the	  
interaction	  of	  treatment	  and	  sanitation	  facilities,	  𝜆! ,	  is	  an	  estimate	  of	  the	  difference	  in	  OD	  of	  
families	   that	   build	   sanitation	   facilities	   in	   treatment	   versus	   control	   communities.	   Hence,	   our	  
estimate	  of	   𝜋 𝑂𝐷 𝑆 = 1 − 𝜋 𝑂𝐷 𝑆 = 0   is	  𝜆! + 𝜆! .	  	  
	  

Unlike	   the	   previous	   estimates,	   the	   parameters	   in	   (5)	   are	   not	   identified	   purely	   off	   the	  

randomized	  experiments.	  A	  major	  concern	  is	  that	  private	  in-­‐home	  sanitation	  construction	  is	  a	  
choice	  and	  might	  be	  correlated	  with	  other	  characteristics	  that	  also	  drive	  open	  defecation	  such	  
as	  wealth,	  education	  and	  preferences	  for	  hygiene	  and	  health.	  To	  investigate	  how	  much	  other	  
characteristics	  might	  be	  driving	  our	  results,	  we	  estimate	  a	  second	  set	  of	  models	  that	  include	  a	  
series	   of	   variables	   measured	   at	   baseline	   to	   control	   for	   differences	   in	   wealth,	   education	   and	  
preferences.	   In	   all	   4	   countries	   we	   control	   for	   the	   head’s	   years	   of	   schooling,	   family	   composition,	  
knowledge	   that	   open	   defecation	   causes	   diarrhea,	   whether	   the	   household	   believes	   open	  
defecation	  is	  acceptable,	  income	  or	  wealth	  per	  capita,	  and	  for	  Indonesia	  we	  additionally	  control	  
for	   risk	   preferences	   and	   time	   discount	   rates.	   	   The	   detailed	   list	   of	   control	   variables	   for	   each	  
country	  is	  listed	  in	  the	  table	  notes	  of	  Table	  5.

	  	  This	  specification	  is	  essentially	  a	  version	  of	  the	  Blinder	  (1973)	  and	  Oaxaca	  (1973)	  decomposition	  of	  a	  treatment	  
effect	  into	  its	  pathways.	  

13	  
	  
	  

	  

	  

We	  report	  results	  from	  the	  estimation	  of	  equation	  (5)	  without	  any	  controls	  in	  Panel	  A	  

and	  with	  controls	  Panel	  B	  in	  Table	  5.	  	  We	  note	  that	  the	  point	  estimates	  are	  almost	  identical	  in	  
the	  models	  and	  without	  controls	  allowing	  us	  to	  cautiously	  interpret	  these	  estimates	  as	  causal.	  
	  

The	   first	   parameter	   of	   interest	   is	   the	   coefficient	   on	   treatment,	  λ! ,	   which	   is	   the	   estimate	  

of	  dπ OD S = 0 .	   The	   coefficient	   is	   negative	   and	   statistically	   significant	   in	   3	   out	   of	   four	  
countries	  consistent	  with	  treatment	  increasing	  the	  use	  of	  shared	  sanitation	  facilities	  outside	  of	  
the	   home.	   However,	   the	   estimated	   effect	   in	   Mali	   is	   substantially	   larger	   than	   in	   the	   other	  
countries	  consistent	  with	  the	  behavioral	  change	  intervention	  being	  substantially	  more	  intensive	  
in	   Mali	   compared	  to	  the	  other	  countries.	  Only	  in	  India	  was	  there	  no	  effect	  on	  the	  defecation	  
practices	   of	   family	   without	   private	   facilities	   again	   consistent	   with	   the	   fact	   that	   public	   or	  
community	   toilets	   were	   not	   constructed,	   the	   behavior	   change	   and	   subsidies	   both	   focused	   on	  
building	  and	  using	  in-­‐home	  private	  toilets.	   	  
	  

The	  coefficient	  on	  S! ,	  λ! ,	  is	  negative,	  large,	  and	  statistically	  significant	  in	  all	  4	  countries.	  	  

The	   point	   estimates	   are	   large	   suggesting	   that	   the	   installation	   of	   in-­‐home	   sanitation	   facilities	  
greatly	   reduces	   OD.	   Lowering	   the	   time	   and	   hassle	   cost	   of	   use	   of	   sanitation	   facilities	   greatly	  
reduces	  open	  defecation.	  In	  3	  out	  of	  the	  four	  countries	  the	  point	  estimates	  are	  very	  similar;	  The	  
installation	  of	  private	  in-­‐home	  sanitation	  facilities	  reduces	  OD	  rates	  by	  about	  0.3.	  	  In	  Indonesia,	  
the	  point	  estimate	  is	  about	  twice	  the	  effect	  in	  the	  other	  countries.	  	  
	  

The	   coefficient	   on	   the	   interaction	   of	   treatment	   and	  S! ,	  λ! ,	   is	   positive	   and	   statistically	  

significant	  in	   Mali.	   In	   addition,	   though	   not	   statistically	   significant,	   it	   is	   positive	   and	   non-­‐trivial	   in	  
Indonesia	   and	   Tanzania.	   Only	   in	   India	   is	   the	   coefficient	   both	   not	   statistically	   significant	   and	  
small	  in	  magnitude.	  The	  largest	  effect	  (0.15)	  is	  in	  Mali,	  which	  had	  the	  strongest	  behavioral	  CLTS	  
intervention	  followed	  by	  Indonesia	  (0.11)	  and	  Tanzania	  (0.06),	  which	  had	  a	  weaker	  behavioral	  
CLTS	   intervention	   and	   combined	   CLTS	   with	   improvements	   in	   the	   supply	   of	   sanitation	  
installation.	  The	  smallest	  effect	  was	  in	  India	  (0.001),	  which	  combined	  the	  weaker	  CLTS	  approach	  
with	   large	   subsidies	   for	   sanitation	   installation.	   	   This	   suggests	   that	   households	   that	   were	  
convinced	  by	  the	  CLTS	  health	  promotion	  to	  install	  private	  in-­‐home	  sanitation	  facilities	  use	  them	  
less	   than	   those	   who	   installed	   them	   without	   the	   nudge,	   whereas	   there	   is	   no	   difference	   in	   use	  
when	  subsidies	  were	  the	  primary	  incentive	  to	  install	  the	  facilities.

Decomposition	  	  

We	  now	  use	  these	  parameter	  estimates	  to	  decompose	  the	  change	  in	  open	  defecation	  
into	  the	  following	  behavioral	  and	  investment	  pathways	  based	  on	  equation	  (2):	  
	  

(i)	  𝑑𝜋 𝑂𝐷 𝑆 = 1 𝜋 𝑠 	  =	  change	  in	  OD	  by	  those	  with	  private

(ii)	  𝑑𝜋 𝑂𝐷 𝑆 = 0 1 − 𝜋 𝑠 	  =	  change	  in	  OD	  by	  those	  without	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
private	  in-­‐home	  sanitation	  facilities	  (behavioral)	  
(iii)	  𝑑𝜋 𝑆 𝜋 𝑂𝐷 𝑆 = 1 − 𝜋 𝑂𝐷 𝑆 = 0   =	  change	  in	  OD	  due	  to	  investment	  in

The	   decomposition	   results	   are	   presented	   in	   Table	   6.	   In	   3	   out	   of	   4	   countries,	   the	  

behavioral	  pathways	  (i.e.	  increased	  used	  of	  sanitation	  facilities)	  accounted	  for	  more	  than	  half	  of	  
the	   reduction	   in	   open	   defection	   obtained	   from	   the	   intervention.	   	   Only	   in	   India	   was	   all	   of	   the	  
change	  (100%)	  due	  to	  investment	  in	  private	  in-­‐home	  sanitation	  facilities.	  This	  is	  likely	  due	  to	  the	  
fact	  that	  India	  is	  the	  only	  country	  that	  had	  subsidies	  for	  construction.	  	  	  
In	   the	   3	   countries	   where	   behavioral	   change	   was	   important,	   only	   in	   Mali	   was	   there	   a	  
significant	  behavioral	  change	  among	  those	  who	  had	  private	  in-­‐home	  sanitation	  facilities,	  while	  
in	  Indonesia	  and	  Tanzania	  the	  behavioral	  change	  was	  concentrated	  in	  households	  without	   in-­‐
home	   facilities	  by	  increasing	  use	  of	  shared	  out-­‐of-­‐home	  sanitation	  facilities.	   This	  is	  consistent	  
with	  the	  fact	  that	  the	  CLTS	  component	  was	  much	  more	  intensive	  in	  Mali	  compared	  to	  the	  other	  
countries.

CHILD	  HEALTH	  
Promotion	  of	  healthy	  behaviors	  and	  in	  particular	  reducing	  open	  defecation	  is	  designed	  

to	   improve	   health	   outcomes.	   Open	   defecation	   leads	   to	   the	   fecal	   contamination	   of	   water	   and	  
food	   supplies	   and	   to	   the	   transmission	   of	   soil	   borne	   helminthes	   (Chavasse	   et	   al.,	   1999).	  	  
Gastrointestinal	   pathogenic	   infections	   consume	   micronutrients,	   cause	   diarrhea,	   and	   reduce	   the	  
absorption	   of	   nutrition	   in	   general,	   leading	   to	   retarded	   growth	   and	   development	   in	   young	  
children.

In	  this	  section,	  we	  assess	  the	  extent	  to	  which	  reductions	  in	  open	  defecation	  improved	  
child	  health	  outcomes	  measured	  by	  height	  of	  children	  less	  than	  5	  at	  endline,	  an	  age	  at	  which	  
height	  is	  sensitive	  to	  parasitic	  infections,	  diarrhea,	  and	  illness	  in	  general.	  We	  construct	  height-­‐
for-­‐age	  z-­‐scores,	  which	  place	  the	  child’s	  height	  in	  the	  distribution	  of	  a	  well-­‐nourished	  reference	  
population	  for	  her	  age.	  We	  use	  a	  standardized	  age-­‐	  and	  gender-­‐specific	  growth	  reference	  based	  
on	  WHO	  standards	  (2006,	  2007).	  	  
We	  measure	  OD	  at	  the	  village	  level	  rather	  than	  at	  the	  household	  level	  since	  a	  family’s	  
protection	  from	  the	  pathogens	  spread	  through	  OD	  depends	  on	  both	  their	  own	  behavior	  and	  the	  
behavior	   of	   their	   neighbors.	   	   Eliminating	   their	   own	   OD	   will	   have	   limited	   protection	   if	   their	  
neighbors	  continue	  to	  practice	  OD.	  	  

4.1

Empirical	  Specification	  	  

Our	   empirical	   approach	   is	   based	   on	   the	   health	   capital	   model	   originally	   proposed	   in	  
Grossman	  (1972)	  that	  specifies	  health	  as	  stock	  that	  accumulates	  as	  a	  function	  of	  investment:	  
𝐻! = 𝐼! + 1 − 𝛿 𝐻!!! + 𝜀! 	  	   	  

	  

	  

	  

	  

(6)	  

In	   (6)	  𝐻! 	  is	   the	   stock	   of	   health	   capital	   in	   period	   t,	  𝐼! 	  is	   investment	   in	   health	   capital	   such	   as	  
nutrition,	   prevention	   and	   curative	   medical	   care,	   and	   prevention	   activities	   such	   as	   exercise,	   safe	  
water	  and	  sanitation;  𝛿	  is	  the	  depreciation	  rate,	  and	  𝜀! 	  is	  a	  shock	  to	  health	  in	  period	  t.	  	  	  
The	   general	   approach	   will	   be	   to	   replace	  𝐼! 	  with	   measures	   of	   village	   levels	   of	   OD	   and	  
estimate	  an	  equation	  of	  the	  following	  form:	  
𝐻!"# = 𝛼 + 𝛽𝑂𝐷!! + 𝛾𝐻!"#!! + 𝜀!"# 	  	   	  

	  

	  

	  

(7)	  

Where	  𝑂𝐷!" 	  is	  the	  open	  defecation	  rate	  in	  village	  j	  in	  period	  t.	  By	  conditioning	  on	  lagged	  𝐻!!! ,	  
𝛽 is	  interpreted	  as	  the	  effect	  of	  village	  OD	  on	  child	  growth	  between	  the	  2	  periods.	  

4.2

Variation	  in	  Village	  Open	  Defecation	  Rates	  

In	   the	   analysis	   above	   we	   demonstrated	   at	   the	   household	   level	   that	   the	   effect	   of	  
treatment	   on	   household	   level	   OD	   depends	   on	   whether	   the	   household	   had	   private	   in-­‐home	  

16	  
	  
	  

	  

sanitation	   at	   baseline.	   Therefore,	   the	   effect	   of	   treatment	   on	   village	   OD	   rates	   should	   vary	  
depending	  on	  village	  private	  sanitation	  coverage	  at	  baseline.	  	  
Figure	   1	   presents	   the	   distributions	   of	   village-­‐level	   private	   sanitation	   rates	   at	   baseline	  
and	   shows	   substantial	   heterogeneity	   both	   within	   and	   between	   countries.	   We	   restrict	   this	  
analysis	  to	  the	  3	  countries	  for	  which	  we	  have	  data	  on	  child	  height	  both	  at	  baseline	  and	  follow-­‐
up:	  India,	  Indonesia	  and	  Mali.	  India	  had	  by	  far	  the	  lowest	  baseline	  sanitation	  coverage,	  with	  the	  
majority	  of	  villages	  having	  less	  than	  20%	  of	  households	  with	  private	  sanitation.	  Indonesia	  had	  
the	  highest	  coverage	  rates,	  with	  Mali	  in	  between	  India	  and	  Indonesia.	  
The	   difference	   in	   baseline	   village	   sanitation	   did	   indeed	   result	   in	   substantial	  
heterogeneity	  in	  village-­‐level	  OD	  rates.	  In	  Figure	  2,	  we	  present	  the	  distributions	  of	  village-­‐level	  
OD	  rates	  by	  treatment	  and	  control	  groups.	  Overall	  in	  Panel	  A,	  there	  was	  a	  substantial	  shift	  in	  
villages	   from	   the	   top	   3	   quintiles	   to	   the	   bottom	   two	   quintiles	   and	   especially	   to	   the	   lowest	  
quintile	   in	   OD	   rates.	   	   In	   India	   (Panel	   B),	   the	   shift	   was	   from	   the	   highest	   quintile	   to	   the	   middle	  
quintile.	   In	   Indonesia	   (Panel	   C),	   the	   shift	   was	   from	   middle	   3	   quintiles	   to	   the	   lowest	   quintile.	  
Finally,	  in	  Mali	  (Panel	  D),	  the	  shift	  was	  from	  the	  top	  3	  quintiles	  to	  the	  bottom	  2	  quintiles.	  

4.3

The	  Impact	  of	  Village	  Open	  Defection	  on	  Child	  Height	  

In	  this	  section	  we	  estimate	  the	  causal	  relationship	  between	  village	  OD	  and	  child	  height	  
exploiting	   the	   experimentally	   induced	   variation	   in	   village	   OD	   for	   identification.	   To	   do	   so,	   we	  
pool	  the	  data	  from	  the	  3	  countries	  for	  which	  we	  have	  data	  on	  child	  height	  both	  at	  baseline	  and	  
follow-­‐up:	  India,	  Indonesia	  and	  Mali.	  The	  analysis	  sample	  includes	  5600	  observations	  from	  318	  
villages.	  
We	   first	   estimate	   the	   association	   between	   child	   height	   z-­‐scores	   and	   village-­‐level	   OD	  
non-­‐parametrically	  using	  Lowess	  regression	  (Figure	  3).	  The	  relationship	  is	  negative,	  i.e.	  height	  
for	  age	  z-­‐scores	  fall	  as	  the	  village	  OD	  rises,	  and	  the	  95-­‐degree	  confidence	  regions	  are	  very	  tight.	  
Remarkably,	   the	   relationship	   appears	   to	   be	   linear	   suggesting	   that	   there	   is	   no	   threshold	   that	  
needs	  to	  be	  achieved	  to	  obtain	  health	  benefits.	  
	  

We	  estimate	  (7)	  by	  IV	  GMM	  using	  the	  pooled	  data	  both	  with	  and	  without	  individual	  and	  

household	   socio-­‐economic	   controls.	   The	   individual	   and	   household	   level	   controls	   are	   entered	   as	  
17	  
	  
	  

	  

interactions	  with	  an	  indicator	  variable	  for	  the	  country	  in	  which	  the	  child	  lives.	  We	  instrument	  
for	  𝑂𝐷!" 	  using	   randomized	   treatment	   assignment	   status	   of	   the	   village	   and	   an	   interaction	   of	  
assignment	  status	  and	  the	  baseline	  level	  of	  in-­‐home	  sanitation	  coverage	  in	  the	  village;	  i.e.	  the	  
share	  of	  households	  that	  had	  private	  in-­‐home	  sanitation	  facilities	  at	  baseline.	  From	  the	  analysis	  
above	   the	   overall	   effect	   of	   treatment	   on	   households	   varies	   by	   whether	   the	   household	   had	  
sanitation	  at	  baseline.	  Therefore,	  the	  effect	  of	  treatment	  on	  village	  OD	  should	  vary	  by	  the	  share	  
of	   households	   that	   had	   sanitation	   facilities	   at	   baseline.	  Again,	   we	   interact	   the	   instruments	   with	  
country	  indicators,	  thus	  giving	  us	  6	  instruments.	  	  
The	  results	  are	  reported	  in	  Table	  7.	  The	  estimated	  effects	  are	  statistically	  significant	  for	  
all	   of	   the	   models.	   The	   Kleeberg-­‐Pop	   F-­‐statistics	   from	   the	   first	   stage	   are	   large	   and	   the	  
instruments	  are	  statistically	  significant	  for	  5	  out	  of	  the	  6	  variables	  (Panel	  B).	  Interestingly,	  the	  IV	  
estimates	   of	   the	   effect	   of	   Village	   OD	   on	   height	   are	   relatively	   close	   in	   magnitude	   to	   the	   OLS	  
estimates	   (Panel	   A).	   In	   addition,	   while	   adding	   controls	   lowers	   the	   estimated	   impact,	   the	  
reduction	   is	   relatively	   small.	   The	   estimated	   slope	   means	   that	   fully	   eliminating	   OD	   in	   a	   village	  
where	   everyone	   practices	   OD	   would	   be	   associated	   with	   a	   0.44	   standard	   deviation	   increase	   in	  
height.	  Another	  way	  to	  interpret	  the	  results	  is	  a	  one	  standard	  deviation	  reduction	  in	  the	  open	  
defecation	  index	  (0.47)	  would	  yield	  about	  a	  0.22	  standard	  deviation	  increase	  in	  height.	  	  
The	  results	  have	  different	  implications	  for	  each	  of	  the	  countries	  depending	  on	  baseline	  
OD	  rates.	  	  The	  biggest	  potential	  gains	  are	  in	  India	  where	  baseline	  village	  OD	  rates	  are	  0.86.	  	  In	  
this	   case,	   reducing	   OD	   by	   half	   would	   yield	   about	   a	   0.4	   standard	   deviation	   in	   height.	   	   In	  
Indonesia	  and	  Mali,	  where	  baseline	  village	  OD	  rates	  are	  0.41	  and	  0.56	  respectively,	  one	  would	  
have	  to	  virtually	  eliminate	  OD	  to	  achieve	  similar	  levels	  of	  improvement	  in	  height.	  Finally,	  even	  
though	   it	   was	   not	   included	   in	   the	   estimation,	   eliminating	   OD	   in	   Tanzania	   would	   yield	   at	   best	  
modest	  gains	  in	  height	  as	  baseline	  village	  OD	  rates	  are	  only	  0.23.

Average	  Treatment	  Effects	  	  

The	   above	   results	   explain	   in	   part	   the	   mixed	   results	   of	   the	   estimates	   of	   average	  
treatment	  effects	  of	  CLTS	  based	  interventions	  on	  child	  height	  in	  the	  literature.	  We	  estimate	  the	  
average	  treatment	  effects	  of	  the	  interventions	  on	  height	  using	  a	  version	  of	  equation	  (6)	  where	  
18	  
	  
	  

	  

the	   investment	   is	   the	   reduction	   in	   open	   defecation	   at	   the	   village	   level	   generated	   by	   the	  
interventions.

(8)	  

Where	  𝑇!" 	  takes	  on	  the	  value	  one	  if	  village	  j	  received	  the	  intervention	  in	  period	  t.	  In	  this	  case,	  𝛽 	  
is	  the	  ITT	  estimate	  of	  the	  impact	  of	  treatment	  in	  child	  height.	  
In	   Table	   8	   we	   present	   the	   results.	   The	   estimated	   average	   treatment	   effects	   on	   height	   in	  
India	  and	  Indonesia	  were	  small	  and	  not	  significant,	  whereas	  in	  Mali	  the	  estimated	  effect	  size	  is	  
0.17	   standard	   deviations.	   In	   India,	   Indonesia	   and	   Tanzania	   the	   interventions	   reduced	   average	  
village	   OD	   rates	   by	   0.03,	   0.09	   and	   0.12	   respectively;	   not	   enough	   to	   achieve	   measureable	  
improvements	  in	  height.	  In	  contrast	  in	  Mali,	  the	  average	  treatment	  effect	  on	  OD	  is	  0.33,	  close	  
to	  3-­‐times	  higher	  than	  any	  of	  the	  other	  countries.

DISCUSSION	  
This	   paper	   examines	   the	   extent	   to	   which	   health	   promotional	   nudges	   work	   through	  

investment	   in	   health	   products	   that	   lower	   the	   marginal	   cost	   of	   good	   behavior	   or	   through	  
behavioral	   change	   using	   those	   products	   more	   than	   otherwise.	   The	   results	   address	   whether	  
subsidies	   for	   health	   products	   are	   enough	   or	   whether	   nudges	   to	   use	   health	   products	   are	  
necessary	   to	   change	   behavior	   sufficiently	   to	   improve	   health	   outcomes.	   Subsidies	   would	   be	  
sufficient	  if	  households	  are	  simply	  liquidity	  constrained	  and	  have	  been	  unable	  to	  save	  enough	  
or	   borrow	  to	   be	   able	   to	   build	   toilets.	   However,	   if	   open	   defecation	   is	   a	   deep-­‐rooted	   habit	   that	   is	  
culturally	  acceptable,	  then	  simply	  encouraging	  people	  to	  build	  toilets	  may	  not	  be	  enough	  to	  get	  
people	  to	  use	  them.	  	  
We	  reported	  on	  the	  effects	  and	  mechanisms	  of	  health	  promotion	  campaigns	  designed	  
to	   eliminate	   open	   defecation	   in	   at-­‐scale	   randomized	   field	   experiments	   in	   4	   countries:	   India,	  
Indonesia,	   Mali,	   and	   Tanzania.	   The	   field	   experiments	   are	   at-­‐scale	   in	   the	   sense	   that	   the	  
interventions	   were	   designed	   and	   implemented	   by	   governments	   as	   part	   of	   their	   national	  
environmental	   health	   strategies,	   and	   randomly	   rolled	   out	   geographically	   over	   time.	   The	  

19	  
	  
	  

	  

combination	  of	  at-­‐scale	   randomized	  field	  experiments	  in	  4	  countries	  provides	  not	  only	  strong	  
internal	  validity	  but	  also	  a	  degree	  of	  external	  validity	  not	  seen	  in	  most	  studies.	  
We	  find	  evidence	  that	  in	  3	  of	  the	  4	  countries	  a	  large	  portion	  of	  the	  reduction	  in	  open	  
defecation	   came	   through	   behavioral	   change,	   i.e.	   increased	   use	   of	   sanitation	   facilities,	   as	  
opposed	  to	  investing	  in	  in-­‐home	  sanitation	  facilities.	  The	  more	  intensive	  the	  health	  promotion	  
the	  larger	  was	  the	  behavioral	  mechanism	  relative	  to	  the	  investment	  mechanism.	  Interestingly,	  
households	   used	   new	   private	   in-­‐home	   sanitation	   facilities	   less	   in	   countries	   where	   they	   were	  
induced	  to	  build	  through	  shaming	  than	  in	  countries	  where	  they	  were	  induced	  to	  build	  through	  
subsidies.	   Only	   in	   India,	   where	   the	   primary	   intervention	   was	   subsidies	   for	   construction	   of	   in-­‐
home	  facilities,	  was	  all	  of	  the	  effect	  achieved	  through	  investment.	  	  These	  results	  suggest	  that	  
there	  may	  be	  gains	  to	  combining	  behavioral	  nudges	  on	  top	  of	  health	  product	  subsidies	  and	  that	  
the	  intensity	  of	  the	  nudge	  is	  important.	  	  
Despite	  all	  interventions	  reducing	  open	  defecation,	  it	  does	  not	  appear	  that	  most	  of	  the	  
interventions	  were,	  on	  average,	  strong	  enough	  to	  be	  able	  improve	  child	  health.	  Only	  the	  Mali	  
intervention	  is	  significantly	  associated	  with	  a	  0.17	  standard	  deviation	  increase	  in	  height	  and	  the	  
Mali	   intervention	   had	   close	   to	   3-­‐times	   the	   effect	   on	   open	   defecation	   than	   the	   next	   most	  
effective	  intervention.	  	  
In	   order	   to	   assess	   the	   magnitudes	   of	   reductions	   in	   OD	   needed	   to	   achieve	   meaningful	  
improvements	   in	   child	   health,	   we	   pooled	   the	   data	   and	   estimated	   the	   relationship	   between	  
village-­‐level	  OD	  and	  child	  height	  using	  experimentally	  induced	  variation	  in	  the	  data	  to	  identify	  
the	  causal	  relationship.	  	  We	  estimated	  that	  completely	  eliminating	  OD	  from	  a	  village	  in	  which	  
everyone	  defecated	  in	  the	  open	  would	  result	  in	  a	  0.44	  standard	  deviation	  increase	  in	  height.	  
	  

There	  are	  a	  number	  of	  important	  conclusions	  from	  this	  analysis.	  First	  of	  all,	  reductions	  in	  

village-­‐level	  OD	  do	  indeed	  seem	  to	  lead	  to	  improved	  child	  height.	  Second,	  reductions	  in	  OD	  in	  
villages	  that	  have	  relatively	  low	  levels	  of	  OD	  are	  not	  only	  going	  to	  be	  hard	  to	  achieve	  but	  are	  
unlikely	  to	  have	  an	  impact	  on	  health.	  	  Third,	  the	  small	  to	  modest	  reductions	  in	  OD	  generated	  
from	   the	   interventions	   in	   India,	   Indonesia	   and	   Tanzania	   were	   not	   large	   enough	   to	   generate	  
meaningful	   improvements	   in	   health.	   	   Hence,	   the	   interventions	   need	   to	   be	   strengthened	   in	  
20	  
	  
	  

	  

order	   to	   reduce	   village	   OD	   enough	   to	   have	   meaningful	   effects	   on	   child	   health.	   	   The	   question	  
then	  is	  what	  types	  of	  interventions	  are	  strong	  enough.	  	  
	  

The	   biggest	   reductions	   in	   village	   OD	   come	   from	   expanding	   sanitation	   coverage.	  

Therefore,	   targeting	   interventions	   to	   villages	   with	   low	   private	   sanitation	   coverage	   has	   the	  
greatest	   potential.	   However,	   the	   expansion	   of	   private	   sanitation	   is	   not	   enough	   by	   itself	   to	   have	  
a	   meaningful	   effect	   on	   height.	   Take-­‐up	   of	   private	   sanitation	   reduces	   household	   OD	   rates	   by	  
0.29	  in	  Mali,	  0.36	  in	  Tanzania,	  0.37	  in	  India,	  and	  0.61	  in	  Indonesia.	  This	  means	  that,	  except	  in	  
Indonesia,	   going	   from	   zero	   to	   100%	   sanitation	   coverage	   would	   still	   lead	   to	   a	   less	   than	   0.2	  
standard	  deviation	  improvement	  in	  height.	  However,	  except	  in	  India,	  most	  villages	  already	  have	  
substantial	   sanitation	   coverage	   implying	   that	   the	   potential	   gains	   from	   increases	   in	   sanitation	  
coverage	  are	  substantially	  lower.	  	  
	  

Moreover,	   how	   one	   promotes	   sanitation	   expansion	   is	   important.	   It	   appears	   that	  

households	   that	   are	   encouraged	   through	   the	   health	   promotion	   into	   installing	   sanitation	  
facilities	   use	   them	   less	   than	   households	   who	   build	   them	   through	   subsidies.	   	   Hence,	   subsidies	  
appear	  to	  be	  a	  more	  effective	  method	  of	  promoting	  households	  to	  use	  private	  sanitation	  than	  
behavior	  change.	  
	  

While	  expanding	  private	  sanitation	  facility	  installation	  is	  a	  critical	  step,	  it	  is	  not	  enough	  

to	  achieve	  meaningful	  improvements	  in	  health	  outcomes.	  Our	  results	  do	  suggest	  however,	  that	  
combining	   subsidies	   with	   intensive	   CLTS	   or	   another	   behavioral	   change	   intervention	   could	   be	  
effective.	  The	  behavioral	  effects	  in	  Mali	  showed	  a	  substantial	  increase	  in	  the	  use	  of	  sanitation	  
among	   those	   who	   had	   sanitation	   facilities.	   	   Specifically,	   in	   Mali	   the	   intervention	   led	   to	   a	  
reduction	   in	   OD	   of	   21	   percentage	   points	   among	   those	   that	   had	   private	   sanitation	   facilities	   at	  
baseline.	   Combining	   this	   with	   a	   large	   expansion	   of	   sanitation	   facilities	   from	   subsidies	   could	  
generate	   sufficiently	   large	   reductions	   in	   village	   OD	   to	   achieve	   meaningful	   improvements	   in	  
health	   outcomes.	   Whether	   this	   approach	   is	   cost-­‐effective	   depends	   in	   large	   part	   on	   the	   price	  
elasticity	  of	  the	  demand	  for	  sanitation	  facilities.

Appendix:  Experimental  Design  and  Data    
Sample	  Selection	  and	  Randomization	  	  
The	  data	  used	  in	  this	  paper	  were	  generated	  from	  cluster-­‐randomized	  interventions	  in	  all	  four	  
countries.	   	   The	   unit	   of	   randomization	   was	   the	   village	   in	   all	   four	   countries.	   In	   3	   out	   of	   the	   4	  
countries,	   the	   villages	   were	   first	   clustered	   into	   strata	   and	   then	   the	   villages	   were	   randomized	  
into	  treatment	  and	  control	  groups	  within	  each	  stratum.	  	  The	  data	  used	  are	  from	  baseline	  and	  
follow-­‐up	   surveys	   of	   households	   with	   children	   under	   2	   years	   of	   age.	   In	   general,	   the	   samples	   for	  
all	   four	   countries	   appear	   to	   be	   well	   balanced	   at	   baseline,	   have	   low	   levels	   of	   attrition,	   and	   show	  
little	   evidence	   of	   attrition	   bias.	   The	   details	   of	   the	   random	   assignment	   and	   data	   collection	   are	  
presented	  in	  Table	  1	  and	  discussed	  in	  the	  data	  appendix.	  	  
	  
The	  evaluation	  occurred	  in	  eight	  districts	  of	  rural	  East	  Java,	  Indonesia;	  in	  2	  districts	  in	  Madhya	  
Pradesh,	  India;	  the	  region	  of	  Koulikoro	  in	  Mali,	  and	  10	  districts	  in	  Tanzania.	  The	  strata	  used	  for	  
random	   assignment	   are	   sub-­‐districts	   in	   Indonesia,	   blocks	   in	   India,	   and	   districts	   in	   Tanzania.	  	  
There	   were	   no	   stratifications	   used	   in	   Mali.	   Detailed	   information	   on	   sample	   selection	   and	  
randomization	   can	   be	   found	   for	   each	   country	   in	   Cameron	   and	   Shah	   (2010),	   Cameron	   et	   al.	  
(2013),	  Patil	  et	  al.	  (2013),	  Alzua	  et	  al.	  (2014),	  and	  Briceño	  et	  al.	  (2014).
	  
In	   Indonesia,	   during	   the	   study	   period,	   trained	   facilitators	   went	   into	   the	   eight	   project	   districts	  
and	   supported	   the	   local	   governments	   in	   conducting	   triggering	   and	   follow-­‐up	   activities	   in	   the	  
communities.	  Of	  the	  80	  treatment	  villages,	  the	  endline	  survey	  data	  shows	  that	  53	  villages	  (66	  
percent)	   were	   triggered.4	  Approximately	   14%	   of	   control	   villages	   were	   triggered.	   Initial	   sample	  
size	  calculations	  indicate	  that	  this	  level	  of	  non-­‐compliance	  was	  not	  sufficient	  to	  underpower	  our	  
results.	  	  
	  
In	  India,	  two	  districts	  in	  Madhya	  Pradesh	  participated	  in	  the	  impact	  evaluation	  of	  TSC	  (Dhar	  and	  
Khargone),	   for	   a	   total	   of	   80	   rural	   villages.	   One	   hundred	   percent	   of	   the	   treatment	   villages	  
received	   the	   program.	   	   Based	   on	   interviews	   with	   block	   level	   Total	   Sanitation	   Campaign	   (TSC)	  
officers,	  all	  treatment	  GPs	  received	  at	  least	  some	  funds	  with	  more	  than	  half	  receiving	  100%	  of

(~25%)	  received	  the	  TSC	  program.	  	  
	  
For	  the	  case	  of	  Mali,	  100%	  of	  the	  treatment	  communities	  received	  the	  program	  and	  59	  out	  of	  
60	  communities	  achieved	  Open	  Defecation	  Free	  Certification.	  While	  10	  percent	  of	  the	  control	  
communities	   reported	   to	   have	   received	   some	   program	   for	   constructing	   latrines,	   they	   do	   not	  
mention	   Unicef	   or	   the	   Malian	   Government.	   The	   team	   was	   not	   aware	   of	   any	   other	   NGOs	  
promoting	   sanitation	   in	   the	   region	   of	   the	   study	   at	   that	   time,	   but	   some	   local	   churches	   and	  
advocacy	  groups	  may	  be	  present	  to	  promote	  improved	  sanitation.

This means that one or more of the four community leaders surveyed (village head, community head, health cadre,
head of women’s organization, or other community leader) reported that the village had received a triggering.

Tanzania	  is	  administratively	  separated	  into	  30	  Regions,	  169	  Districts	  and	  3643	  Wards,	  with	  the	  
average	  ward	  holding	  approximately	  12,000	  people.	  	  The	  sample	  was	  drawn	  from	  10	  districts	  
spread	  throughout	  the	  country	  selected	  by	  the	  Ministry	  of	  Water	  (MoW)	  and	  Ministry	  of	  Health	  
and	  Social	  Welfare	  (MoHSW)	  to	  provide	  geographic	  diversity	  at	  the	  national	  level.	  	  To	  evaluate	  
the	   impact	   of	   TSSM,	   a	   cluster-­‐randomized	   evaluation	   with	   random	   assignment	   of	   interventions	  
at	  the	  ward	  level	  was	  implemented	  (including	  44	  treatment	  and	  46	  control	  wards).	  Wards	  were	  
identified	   as	   the	   optimal	   operational	   unit	   of	   implementation	   for	   the	   project,	   and	   of	   sufficient	  
geographic	   extension	   to	   minimize	   the	   risk	   of	   significant	   information	   spillovers	   between	  
populations	   exposed	   to	   the	   localized	   messages,	   community	   events,	   and	   other	   forms	   of	   social	  
promotion	   activities.	   	   Program	   reports	   suggest	   that	   86%	   of	   wards	   were	   triggered	   with	   TSSM	  
activities	  and	  that	  there	  was	  no	  contamination	  into	  control	  areas.	  	  
Data	  Collection	  	  
The	  data	  collection	  efforts	  focused	  on	  households	  with	  children	  under	  2	  years	  of	  age	  as	  young	  
children’s	   health	   is	   affected	   the	   most	   by	   poor	   sanitation	   (Murray	   and	   Lopez,	   1997).	   All	   countries	  
used	  similar	  and	  standardized	  structured	  questionnaires,	  but	  questionnaires	  were	  also	  modified	  
to	   suit	   the	   local	   research	   needs.	   The	   survey	   collected	   data	   on	   social	   and	   demographic	  
characteristics	   of	   the	   household	   and	   its	   members,	   information	   on	   household	   income,	   assets	  
and	   labor	   force	   activity,	   household	   infrastructure	   and	   services	   for	   sanitation,	   hygiene	   and	  
water,	  major	  housing	  facilities	  and	  amenities,	  and	  child	  school	  attendance	  and	  care.	  The	  survey	  
also	   elicited	   the	   sanitation	   and	   hygiene	   knowledge,	   attitudes,	   and	   practices	   of	   the	   main	  
caregivers	   of	   children	   under	   5	   years.	   The	   health	   survey	   recorded	   recent	   illness	   for	   children	  
under	  5	  years	  and	  anthropometric	  measurements.	  	  
	  
In	   Indonesia,	   the	   baseline	   survey	   was	   conducted	   in	   both	   treatment	   and	   control	   communities	   in	  
August	  –	  September	  2008.	  A	  total	  of	  2,087	  households	  with	  2,353	  children	  under	  5	  years	  in	  160	  
sub-­‐villages	  were	  interviewed.	  The	   sample	  frame	  of	  households	  with	  at	  least	  one	  child	  under	  2	  
years	   was	   determined	   by	   lists	   provided	   by	   the	   community	   health	   cadre	   in	   each	   sub-­‐village.	  	  
Thirteen	  households	  were	  then	  randomly	  selected	  from	  this	  listing	  to	  participate	  in	  the	  baseline	  
survey.	  The	  follow-­‐up	  data	  collection	  was	  conducted	  approximately	  24	  months	  later,	  between	  
November	   2010	   and	   February	   2011.	   The	   endline	   survey	   used	   the	   same	   field	   methodology	   as	  
the	  baseline	  survey.	  The	  final	  sample	  size	  in	  the	  endline	  survey	  included	  1,908	  households	  from	  
the	   baseline	   survey	   with	   no	   significant	   differential	   attrition	   between	   treatment	   and	   control	  
groups.	  
	  
In	   India,	   the	   baseline	   survey	   was	   conducted	   in	   May-­‐July	   2009.	   	   From	   the	   80	   villages	   we	  
completed	  surveys	  of	  1954	  households.	  	  The	  survey	  firm	  listed	  and	  mapped	  households	  in	  each	  
village	   with	   information	   on	   whether	   they	   had	   a	   child	   under	   2	   years.	   From	   the	   list	   of	   eligible	  
households,	   25	   households	   were	   randomly	   selected	   by	   the	   supervisor	   of	   the	   survey	   team	   using	  
systematic	   random	   sampling.	   	   The	   follow	   up	   survey	   was	   conducted	   in	   February-­‐April	   2011	   –	   21	  
months	   after	   the	   baseline	   survey.	   The	   final	   sample	   size	   in	   the	   endline	   survey	   included	   1655	  
households	  from	  the	  baseline	  survey	  with	  2046	  children,	  again	  with	  no	  significant	  differential	  
attrition	  between	  the	  treatment	  and	  control	  groups.

For	   Mali,	   baseline	   information	   was	   collected	   between	   April	   and	   July	   2011.	   A	   census	   was	  
conducted	   in	   all	   121	   communities	   and	   all	   households	   with	   children	   under	   10	   where	  
interviewed.	   	   A	   total	   of	   4532	   households	   were	   interviewed	   at	   baseline.	   The	   follow	   up	   survey	  
took	  place	  between	  April	  and	  June	  2013	  and	  a	  total	  of	  4031	  households	  could	  be	  matched	  to	  
the	   ones	   present	   in	   the	   baseline.	   Finally,	   children	   with	   complete	   anthropometric	   measures	  
matched	  at	  baseline	  and	  follow	  up	  total	  approximately	  2619.	  	  	  	  
	  
Tanzania	   lacks	   a	   baseline	   survey	   and	   only	   had	   endline	   data.	  Although	   a	   baseline	   data	   collection	  
was	  intended,	  unanticipated	  problems	  with	  reliability	  of	  data	  resulted	  in	  the	  cancelation	  of	  field	  
work	  in	  five	  out	  of	  the	  10	  districts	  originally	  planned	  and	  the	  impossibility	  of	  using	  the	  data	  to	  
validate	  the	  randomized	  design,	  as	  it	  was	  originally	  planned.	   However,	  an	  endline	  survey	  was	  
conducted	  in	  2012.	  Sample	  size	  details	  are	  given	  in	  Table	  1.	  	  
Tests	  of	  Balance	  and	  Attrition	  
Randomization	   aims	   to	   minimize	   systematic	   differences	   between	   the	   control	   and	   treatment	  
groups.	  However,	  the	  extent	  of	  sample	  attrition	  and	  the	  degree	  to	  which	  attrition	  is	  nonrandom	  
is	  a	  legitimate	  concern	  in	  any	  follow-­‐up	  survey.	  	  In	  India,	  of	  the	  1,954	  households	  surveyed	  at	  
the	   baseline,	   299	   were	   lost	   and	   1,655	   were	   surveyed	   in	   the	   follow-­‐up	   survey	   (15%	   attrition).	  
The	  sample	  loss	  was	  not	  differential	  by	  the	  treatment	  (154)	  and	  control	  (145)	  groups.	  Patil	  et	  al.	  
(2013)	   show	   that	   the	   attrition	   was	   also	   not	   differential	   by	   the	   treatment	   and	   control	   groups	  
based	   on	   several	   important	   characteristics	   and	   that	   the	   baseline	   samples	   are	   well	   balanced	  
between	   treatment	   and	   control	   villages.	   	   The	   few	   variables	   that	   were	   not	   balanced	   at	   the	  
baseline	  are	  adjusted	  for	  in	  our	  analysis.	  	  
	  
In	  Indonesia,	  of	  2,087	  households	  interviewed	  at	  the	  baseline	  8.5	  percent	  households	  were	  lost	  
and	  1,908	  households	  were	  successfully	  re-­‐interviewed	  at	  the	  follow	  up	  survey.	  	  The	  loss	  was	  
similar	  in	  treatment	  and	  control	  villages;	  86	  households	  in	  the	  control	  and	  93	  households	  in	  the	  
treatment	  group.	  Cameron	  and	  Shah	  (2010)	  show	  that	  baseline	  sample	  was	  well	  balanced	  and	  
Cameron	  et	  al.	  (2013)	  report	  that	  attrition	  did	  not	  result	  in	  significant	  imbalance	  in	  important	  
household	  characteristics	  between	  treatment	  and	  control	   villages.	  	  The	  few	  variables	  that	  were	  
imbalanced	  at	  the	  baseline	  are	  adjusted	  for	  in	  our	  analysis	  
	  
For	  Mali,	  4532	  households	  were	  present	  at	  baseline	  and	  12.5%	  were	  either	  lost	  or	  could	  not	  be	  
matched	  to	  the	  ones	  in	  the	  baseline.	  In	  the	  follow	  up,	  5206	  households	  were	  interviewed,	  4031	  
were	  matched	  to	  baseline	  ones.	  The	  loss	  does	  not	  differ	  between	  treatment	  and	  control	  groups	  
and	  that	  attrition	  did	  not	  produced	  imbalance.	  (Alzua	  et	  al	  2014).	  
	  
Tests	  of	  balance	  and	  attrition	  for	  Tanzania	  are	  challenging	  since	  there	  was	  no	  baseline	  survey.	  
However,	   we	   show	   balance	   for	   a	   combination	   of	   time-­‐invariant	   indicators	   and	   retrospective	  
responses	   asked	   in	   the	   endline	   dating	   to	   February	   2009,	   before	   the	   intervention	   had	   started.	  
Table	   A4	   suggests	   fairly	   good	   balance.	   Differential	   attrition	   due	   to	   migration	   or	   other	   causes	  
could	   also	   be	   a	   concern.	   However,	   data	   from	   the	   complete	   census	   listings	   of	   selected	  
39	  
	  
	  

	  

enumerator	   areas	   provide	   evidence	   of	   limited	   migration	   and	   attrition.	   Less	   than	   5%	   of	  
households	  moved	  into	  the	  community	  within	  the	  three	  year	  intervention	  period,	  and	  this	  does	  
not	   differ	   across	   treatment/control	   groups.	   We	   mitigate	   any	   confounding	   that	   migration	   may	  
cause	  by	  restricting	  the	  sample	  to	  households	  residing	  in	  the	  area	  since	  2009.
