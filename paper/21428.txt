Worms at Work: Long-run Impacts of a Child Health Investment

NBER Working Paper No. 21428
July 2015, Revised July 2016
JEL No. I00,I10,I20,J24,O15
ABSTRACT
This study estimates long-run impacts of a child health investment, exploiting community-wide
experimental variation in school-based deworming. The program increased labor supply among
men and education among women, with accompanying shifts in labor market specialization. Ten
years after deworming treatment, men who were eligible as boys stay enrolled for more years of
primary school, work 17%more hours each week, spend more time in non-agricultural selfemployment, are more likely to hold manufacturing jobs, and miss one fewer meal per week.
Women who were in treatment schools as girls are approximately one quarter more likely to have
attended secondary school, halving the gender gap. They reallocate time from traditional
agriculture into cash crops and non-agricultural self-employment. We estimate a conservative
annualized financial internal rate of return to deworming of 32%, and show that mass deworming
may generate more in future government revenue than it costs in subsidies.

1. Introduction
The question of whether – and how much – child health gains affect adult outcomes is of major
research interest across disciplines and great public policy importance. The belief that childhood
health investments may improve adult living standards currently underlies many school health
and nutrition programs in low-income countries.
Existing research suggests several channels through which increasing child health
investments could affect long-run earnings. Grossman’s (1972) seminal health human capital
model interprets health care as an investment that increases future endowments of healthy time.
Bleakley (2010) further develops this theory, arguing that how the additional time is allocated
will depend on how health improvements affect relative productivity in education and in labor.
Pitt, Rosenzweig, and Hassan (2012) – hereafter PRH – further note that time allocation will also
depend on how the labor market values increased human capital and improved raw labor
capacity, and that this in turn may vary with gender. They present a model in which exogenous
health gains in low-income economies tend to reinforce men’s comparative advantage in
occupations requiring raw labor, while leading women to obtain more education and move into
more skill-intensive occupations, and provide evidence consistent with this model.
We examine the case of intestinal worms, which globally affect approximately two
billion people according to the World Health Organization (2014). Worms (helminths) are spread
when infected individuals deposit fecal matter containing eggs in the local environment. Intense
infections lead to lethargy, anemia, and growth stunting (Stephenson et al. 1993; Stoltzfus et al.
1

1997; Guyatt et al. 2001; Silva et al. 2003) and may also weaken the immunological response to
other infections (Kjetland et al. 2006; Kirwan et al. 2010). Chronic parasitic infections in
childhood may lead to inflammation and elevated cortisol that produce adverse health
consequences later in life (Crimmins and Finch 2005), as well as increased maternal morbidity,
low birth weight, and miscarriage (Larocque et al. 2006; Hotez 2009).
There is ongoing debate about whether or not it is appropriate to carry out mass
deworming treatment programs in endemic regions. Because treatment is safe and cheap, but
diagnosis is expensive, the WHO recommends periodic mass school-based deworming in highprevalence areas (World Health Organization 1992). Several other bodies also highlight
deworming as a cost-effective investment (Disease Control Priorities Project 2008; Hall and
Horton 2008; Jameel Poverty Action Lab 2012; Givewell 2013). In contrast, a recent Cochrane
review argues that while treatment of those known to be infected may be warranted, there is
“quite substantial” evidence that mass deworming program does not improve average nutrition,
health, or school performance outcomes (Taylor-Robinson et al. 2015). 1
Yet, because of its selection criteria focusing on medical-style randomized control trials
(RCTs), the Cochrane review includes numerous studies subject to now well-known
methodological limitations (Bundy et al. 2009), and excludes rigorous social science evidence.
For instance, the review excludes Bleakley (2007), which estimates the community-wide impact
of deworming in the early 20th century U.S. South using quasi-experimental difference-in-

difference methods. That study finds that mass deworming improved literacy and raised long-run
adult income by 17%; extrapolating to the higher infection rates in tropical Africa, Bleakley
(2010) estimates deworming could boost income there by 24%. 2
The present paper exploits community-wide experimental variation in a deworming
program for children in Kenyan primary schools, combined with a longitudinal data set tracking
these children into adulthood, to causally identify the effect of improved child health on later life
outcomes. At the time of treatment, program participants had already passed the age window
considered most critical for early childhood development, suggesting that the time endowment
and time allocation effects emphasized in Bleakley (2010), Grossman (1972), and PRH (2012)
may be the most relevant channels of impact. Indeed a survey conducted 1-2 years after
treatment found no cognitive gains. However, consistent with Grossman (1972), treatment led to
large gains in school participation, reducing absenteeism by one quarter (Miguel and Kremer
2004). There was also evidence for epidemiological externalities within this primary school-age
population: untreated children in treatment schools as well as children living near treatment
schools had lower worm infection rates and higher school participation (Miguel and Kremer
2004; Miguel and Kremer 2014), and children less than one year old (who were not eligible for
treatment) in treated communities showed cognitive gains in later tests (Ozier 2014).

A small body of social science research studies the impact of deworming on labor outcomes. In addition to
Bleakley (2007) and Bleakley (2010), early work by Schapiro (1919) using a first-difference research design found
wage gains of 15-27% on Costa Rican plantations after deworming, while Weisbrod et al. (1973) observe little
contemporaneous correlation in the cross-section between worm infections and labor productivity in St. Lucia. We
discuss the related literature estimating deworming impacts on educational outcomes below.

As discussed in Miguel and Kremer (2014), the original Miguel and Kremer (2004) paper
contained several rounding errors, and a coding error in the estimation of cross-school
externalities. Correcting this coding error indicates that short-run, one year epidemiological
externalities extend out to 3 km or 4 km, rather than 6 km (Aiken et al. 2015, Clemens and
Sandefur 2015, Miguel, Kremer and Hamory Hicks 2015). This coding error has been resolved
in the current paper. Davey et al. (2015) express concerns that there were differences across
schools in the number of visits to measure school attendance in Miguel and Kremer (2004). As
noted in Hicks, Kremer and Miguel (2015), there is no statistical evidence for any imbalance in
data collection patterns across treatment and control schools, and the Miguel and Kremer (2004)
results are robust to weighting each individual equally in the analysis. This issue is not relevant
to the current paper, which employs a different dataset than Miguel and Kremer (2004).
In the current analysis, we examine health, education, and labor market outcomes a decade
later, at which point most subjects were young adults 19 to 26 years of age. We find
improvements in self-reported health but not in height. Consistent with PRH, we find important
gender distinctions in long-term deworming impacts. Men who were in treatment schools as boys
work 3.5 more hours each week (on a base of 20.3 hours), spend more time in non-agricultural
self-employment, and are more likely to hold manufacturing jobs with higher wage earnings.
Their living standards improve as well, with males in treatment schools eating one more meal per
week on average. Women who were in treatment schools have better self-reported health, spend
more time in school as girls, and are approximately one quarter more likely to have passed the
secondary school entrance exam and to have attended secondary school. They reallocate time
4

from traditional agriculture to non-agricultural self-employment and are also more likely to grow
cash crops. Estimated effects on labor hours and living standards are larger for those who were
older than 12 years of age (the median age) at baseline, who are much more likely to be out of
school by the follow up survey.
In line with Miguel and Kremer (2004), we also find evidence of positive
epidemiological externalities on long-run outcomes across a range of outcomes using a
seemingly unrelated regression framework. We report point estimates using the linear approach
to estimating externalities employed in that paper, but also develop a procedure for bounding the
impacts of deworming valid under the more general monotonicity assumption that the direct and
epidemiological externality effects on labor market outcomes have the same sign.
Lastly, the estimated impacts of deworming on labor market outcomes, combined with
other data, allow us to estimate fiscal impacts. We find that the additional net government
revenues generated by increased work hours caused by deworming subsidies may be greater than
the direct subsidy cost, suggesting that in the case of deworming, health human capital subsidies
are potentially Pareto-improving. At a minimum, this suggests that the expected costs to
taxpayers are less than would be suggested by multiplying program costs by 1.2 or 1.4 or some
other standard multiplier for the deadweight loss of taxation. We also estimate an annualized
financial internal rate of return to deworming subsidies of 32%, a high return.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the Kenyan context, the
deworming project, and the data. Section 3 presents the estimation strategy. Section 4 discusses
5

the main results. Section 5 combines the results on the price responsiveness of take-up and longrun impacts to assess the fiscal impacts of deworming subsidies, and computes the internal rate
of return. The final section concludes. All appendix material is in the online appendix.

2. Data
This section describes the study area, the deworming program, and the survey, including our
respondent tracking approach and sample summary statistics.

2.1 Study Area and Local Labor Markets
The primary study area is Busia District, a densely-settled farming region in western Kenya
adjacent to Lake Victoria that is somewhat poorer than the national average. Outside labor
market opportunities for children are meager, and boys and girls both typically attend primary
school, with dropout rates rising in grades 7 and 8 (the final two years of primary school).
Primary school completion, when children in the study area are typically between 15 to 18 years
of age, is a key time of labor market transition. Secondary education in Kenya, like tertiary
education in the U.S., depends on exam performance, requires a substantial financial outlay, and
often involves moving away from home. In our data, just over half of control group males and
just under one third of females continue to secondary school. Occupational and family roles
differ markedly by gender, with certain occupations, such as fishing, driving bicycle taxis, and
manufacturing, overwhelmingly male, and others, such as small-scale market trading and
6

domestic service, largely female. The model in PRH (2012) suggests that labor market
opportunities will affect gender-specific educational and labor responses to health investments.

2.2 The Primary School Deworming Project (PSDP)
In 1998 the non-governmental organization (NGO) International Child Support (ICS) launched
the Primary School Deworming Program (PSDP) in two divisions of the district, in 75 primary
schools with a total of 32,565 pupils. Parasitological surveys indicated that baseline helminth
infection rates were over 90% in these areas. Using modified WHO infection thresholds, over
one third of the sample had moderate-heavy infections with at least one helminth (Miguel et al.
2014), a high but not atypical rate in African settings (Brooker et al. 2000; Pullan et al. 2011).
The schools were experimentally divided into three groups (Groups 1, 2, and 3) of 25
schools each: the schools were first stratified by administrative sub-unit (zone), zones were listed
alphabetically within each geographic division, and schools were then listed in order of pupil
enrollment within each zone, with every third school assigned to a given program group. Figure I
presents the project research design and describes the timing of data collection. Appendix section
A contains a detailed description of the experimental design, provides further information on the
sample, and shows that the three groups were well-balanced along baseline characteristics
(appendix Table S1).
Due to the NGO’s administrative and financial constraints, the schools were phased into
deworming treatment during 1998-2001: Group 1 schools began receiving free deworming and
health education in 1998, Group 2 schools in 1999, and Group 3 in 2001. Children in Group 1
7

and 2 schools were thus assigned 2.41 more years of deworming than Group 3 children on
average (appendix Table S2), and these early beneficiaries are the treatment group in the
analysis. Take-up rates were approximately 75% in the treatment group and 5% in the control
group (Miguel and Kremer 2004). In 2001, the NGO required cost-sharing contributions from
parents in a randomly selected half of the Group 1 and Group 2 schools, substantially reducing
take-up, and in 2002-2003 it provided free deworming in all schools (Kremer and Miguel 2007).

2.3 Kenya Life Panel Survey (KLPS) Data
The Kenya Life Panel Survey Round 2 (KLPS-2) was collected during 2007-2009, and tracked a
representative sample of approximately 7,500 respondents who were enrolled in grades 2-7 in the
PSDP schools at baseline. Survey enumerators traveled throughout Kenya and Uganda to
interview those who had moved out of local areas. The effective survey tracking rate in KLPS-2
is 82.5%, and 83.9% among those still alive (see appendix sections A and C for further details on
survey methodology, tracking rates, and attrition). The effective tracking rate is calculated as a
fraction of those found, or not found but searched for during intensive tracking, with weights
adjusted appropriately, in a manner analogous to the approach in the U.S. Moving To
Opportunity study (Orr et al. 2003; Kling, Liebman and Katz 2007).
These are high tracking rates for any age group over a decade, and especially for a mobile
group of adolescents and young adults. Tracking rates are nearly identical and not significantly
different in the treatment and control groups (appendix Table S2).

3. Estimation Strategy
In this section, we define the quantities of interest, describe how to bound them in the presence
of potential epidemiological externalities, and then present our econometric strategy.

3.1 Bounding Deworming Treatment Effects in the Presence of Externalities
We need to account for the possibility of externalities in empirically estimating the impact of
deworming subsidies. Recall that deworming subsidies were assigned at the school level rather
than the individual level. It is therefore worth distinguishing within-school and cross-school
externalities. In the potential presence of within-school epidemiological externalities, we cannot
separately identify the labor market impact of individual deworming status and of deworming
status of others within the school. We can, however, identify the aggregate school-level labor
market effect of the deworming subsidy. We, therefore, classify all individuals in schools with a
deworming subsidy as “treated” in the empirical analysis.
The remaining issue is cross-school epidemiological externalities. In the remainder of this
subsection, we first show that under the relatively weak assumption that the sign of cross-school
epidemiological effects on labor market outcomes is not opposite to the sign of direct effects, the
difference in outcomes between treatment and control communities is a lower bound on the true
total impact of a mass deworming program. For expositional clarity, and to parallel Miguel and
Kremer (2004), we start with a discussion of externality effects after one period but generalize
them below to longer timeframes. We consider a simple epidemiological model in which worm
infection can spread only 𝛿𝛿 kilometers in a single year, for instance, due to the natural movement

9

of and interaction among the local population. Miguel and Kremer (2004), Miguel and Kremer
(2014), and Hicks, Kremer and Miguel (2015) estimate substantial and significant short-run
(after one year) cross-school externalities on worm infections within 3 km of treatment schools.
Consider an outcome 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 for individual 𝑖𝑖 in school 𝑗𝑗 at time 𝑡𝑡, e.g., a labor market

outcome. 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is a function of lagged school-level deworming subsidy treatment assignment,

𝑇𝑇𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−1 ∈ {0,1}, and the proportion of other individuals in communities within 𝛿𝛿 kilometers of that

school also received deworming, 𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−1,𝛿𝛿 ∈ [0,1]. This proportion captures the local “saturation”
of the program. This local treatment rate is a function of both the program’s “coverage”, 𝑅𝑅𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−1,𝛿𝛿

—i.e., the fraction of pupils in nearby schools assigned to the deworming subsidy treatment, as

determined by the research design—and the deworming take-up rate, which is a function of the
deworming subsidy level, 𝑄𝑄(𝑆𝑆). Local treatment saturation is the product of coverage and takeup, 𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−1,𝛿𝛿 = 𝑅𝑅𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−1,𝛿𝛿 𝑄𝑄(𝑆𝑆) + (1 − 𝑅𝑅𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−1,𝛿𝛿 )𝑄𝑄(0), where take-up in the zero subsidy control

group is 𝑄𝑄(0). Kremer and Miguel (2007) found empirically that control group take-up was very
close to zero, implying that 𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−1,𝛿𝛿 = 𝑅𝑅𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−1,𝛿𝛿 𝑄𝑄(𝑆𝑆) is a reasonable approximation. 3 For now, we

focus on saturation, which is the epidemiologically relevant quantity, but return to the distinction
between saturation and coverage in the empirical implementation below.
The first quantity of interest, 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 (1), is the expected overall impact of a mass deworming

program, namely, the difference in expected outcomes between individuals in treated

3

To the extent there was some take-up in control schools, estimates are a lower bound on the impact of deworming.

10

communities fully exposed to other treatment communities (𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−1,𝛿𝛿 = 1) versus individuals in
untreated communities surrounded by untreated communities:

𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 (1) ≡ 𝐸𝐸�𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 | 𝑇𝑇𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−1 = 1, 𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−1,𝛿𝛿 = 1�

− 𝐸𝐸�𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 | 𝑇𝑇𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−1 = 0, 𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−1,𝛿𝛿 = 0�

(1)

The second quantity of interest, 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 (𝑝𝑝), is the impact of a program, such as the one we study, in
which the share of nearby population receiving deworming is 𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−1,𝛿𝛿 = 𝑝𝑝, 𝑝𝑝 ∈ (0, 1). For each
quantity of interest we may also be interested in scaling impact by cost, i.e., 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 (1)/
(Cost of 𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−1,𝛿𝛿 = 1) and 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 (𝑝𝑝)/ (Cost of 𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−1,𝛿𝛿 = 𝑝𝑝).

Define the expected outcome in untreated communities surrounded by other untreated

communities (i.e., “pure control” communities uncontaminated by exposure to nearby treatment
schools) as 𝑦𝑦0,𝑡𝑡 ≡ 𝐸𝐸�𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 |𝑇𝑇𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−1 = 0, 𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−1,𝛿𝛿 = 0� and define the difference in expected outcomes
between treated and untreated communities at a given local treatment saturation proportion p as:
𝜆𝜆1𝑡𝑡 (𝑝𝑝) ≡ 𝐸𝐸�𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 | 𝑇𝑇𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−1 = 1, 𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−1,𝛿𝛿 = 𝑝𝑝�

− 𝐸𝐸�𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 | 𝑇𝑇𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−1 = 0, 𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−1,𝛿𝛿 = 𝑝𝑝�

(2)

Define the difference in average outcomes between untreated communities at a local treatment
proportion 𝑝𝑝 versus pure control communities as:
𝜆𝜆2𝑡𝑡 (𝑝𝑝) ≡ 𝐸𝐸�𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 | 𝑇𝑇𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−1 = 0, 𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−1,𝛿𝛿 = 𝑝𝑝� − 𝑦𝑦0,𝑡𝑡

(3)

The sum of these two effects is 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 (𝑝𝑝) ≡ 𝜆𝜆1𝑡𝑡 (𝑝𝑝) + 𝜆𝜆2𝑡𝑡 (𝑝𝑝).

11

The biological mechanism underlying the spread of worm infections implies that worm
load in a particular location at time 𝑡𝑡 is non-decreasing in worm load in that location and

neighboring areas within distance 𝛿𝛿̃ at lagged time 𝑡𝑡 − 𝑡𝑡̃. Both own and neighbors’ treatment at
time 𝑡𝑡 − 𝑡𝑡̃ should thus reduce own worm load at 𝑡𝑡. This is captured in our first assumption

(where to make the notion of monotonicity concrete, the first inequality establishes that the direct
effect of treatment on Y is positive, without loss of generality):
Assumption 1 (Monotonic externality effects): Suppose for all p,
𝐸𝐸�𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 �𝑇𝑇𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−1 = 1, 𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−𝑡𝑡̃,𝛿𝛿� = 𝑝𝑝� ≥ 𝐸𝐸�𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 �𝑇𝑇𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−1 = 0, 𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−𝑡𝑡̃,𝛿𝛿� = 𝑝𝑝�, then for any two levels of local
treatment saturation 𝑝𝑝′′ > 𝑝𝑝′ , 𝐸𝐸�𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 �𝑇𝑇𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−1 = 𝜇𝜇, 𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−𝑡𝑡̃,𝛿𝛿� = 𝑝𝑝′′ � ≥ 𝐸𝐸�𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 �𝑇𝑇𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−1 = 𝜇𝜇, 𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−𝑡𝑡̃,𝛿𝛿� = 𝑝𝑝′ �

for all 𝜇𝜇 ∈ {0,1}.

In a setting with real-world saturation level 𝑝𝑝, analysis that does not account for cross-

community spillover effects focuses on estimating 𝜆𝜆1𝑡𝑡 (𝑝𝑝). Assumption 1 implies that 𝜆𝜆1𝑡𝑡 (𝑝𝑝) is a
lower bound on both quantities of interest, 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 (1) and 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 (𝑝𝑝).

Proposition 1 (Bounding the treatment effect): Suppose for all p,
𝐸𝐸�𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 �𝑇𝑇𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−1 = 1, 𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−1,𝛿𝛿 = 𝑝𝑝� ≥ 𝐸𝐸�𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 �𝑇𝑇𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−1 = 0, 𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−1,𝛿𝛿 = 𝑝𝑝�, then 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 (1) ≥ 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 (𝑝𝑝) ≥ 𝜆𝜆1𝑡𝑡 (𝑝𝑝)

for all 𝑝𝑝 ∈ (0, 1).

Proof: We proceed in two steps. We first show that 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 (𝑝𝑝′′ ) ≥ 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 (𝑝𝑝′ ) for all 𝑝𝑝′′ > 𝑝𝑝′ . Note that

𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 (𝑝𝑝′′ ) − 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 (𝑝𝑝′ ) = �𝐸𝐸�𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 | 𝑇𝑇𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−1 = 1, 𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−1,𝛿𝛿 = 𝑝𝑝′′ � − 𝑦𝑦0,𝑡𝑡 � − �𝐸𝐸�𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 | 𝑇𝑇𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−1 = 1, 𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−1,𝛿𝛿 =
𝑝𝑝′ � − 𝑦𝑦0,𝑡𝑡 � = 𝐸𝐸�𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 | 𝑇𝑇𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−1 = 1, 𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−1,𝛿𝛿 = 𝑝𝑝′′ � − 𝐸𝐸�𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 | 𝑇𝑇𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−1 = 1, 𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−1,𝛿𝛿 = 𝑝𝑝′ �. This is

greater than or equal to zero by the monotonicity assumption, implying that 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 (1) ≥ 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 (𝑝𝑝) for

12

all 𝑝𝑝 < 1. We next show that 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 (𝑝𝑝) ≡ 𝜆𝜆1𝑡𝑡 (𝑝𝑝) + 𝜆𝜆2𝑡𝑡 (𝑝𝑝) ≥ 𝜆𝜆1𝑡𝑡 (𝑝𝑝). For all 𝑝𝑝 > 0, Assumption 1
implies that 𝜆𝜆2𝑡𝑡 (𝑝𝑝) ≡ 𝐸𝐸�𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 | 𝑇𝑇𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−1 = 0, 𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−1,𝛿𝛿 = 𝑝𝑝� − 𝐸𝐸�𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 | 𝑇𝑇𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−1 = 0, 𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−1,𝛿𝛿 = 0� ≥ 0.

The result follows.

It is possible to tie this result more closely to the empirical analysis by taking into
account the fact that local saturation rates actually differ across communities. Allow 𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−1,𝛿𝛿 to be

distributed across communities as 𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−1,𝛿𝛿 ∼ 𝐹𝐹, with density 𝑓𝑓. Then in practice the average
difference in outcomes across treated and untreated communities is:
𝑃𝑃=1

�

𝑃𝑃=0

𝜆𝜆1𝑡𝑡 (𝑃𝑃)𝑓𝑓(𝑃𝑃)𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑.

Since the result in Proposition 1 holds for all 𝑝𝑝 ∈ (0,1), it holds for this above expression, which
is effectively a weighted average across different saturation proportions p in this set.

The above discussion abstracts away from other covariates. As we discuss below, their
inclusion in a regression analysis is important given the nature of the experimental design and
stratified sampling, and also potentially improves statistical precision. One covariate that we
include in the empirical analysis is the local density of all primary school pupils (in all schools,
treatment and control). We show in Table S2 of the appendix and in Miguel and Kremer (2004)
that the local numbers of all primary school pupils and of treatment school pupils are unrelated to
treatment school assignment, although there is a statistically significant but small difference in
the treatment saturation proportion; the fact that this proportion is slightly lower in treatment
schools implies that the treatment school versus control school difference is, once again, likely to
be a lower bound on true impacts. Drug take-up rates in treatment schools are also not
13

significantly correlated with the local density of either treatment schools or of all schools
(Miguel and Kremer 2004, Appendix Table A.II). Taken together, these patterns imply that any
potential bias in the coefficient estimate on the treatment school indicator would again lead us to
understate deworming impacts.
Note that the bound above will still be valid, albeit looser, if the geographic spread of
epidemiological externalities over time means that even “pure control” (i.e., 𝑇𝑇 = 0 and 𝑃𝑃 = 0)

schools are subject to some spillover from the program. Those whose infection intensity falls due
to cross-school spillovers could themselves generate positive spillovers for other nearby schools,
which would then lead to less local re-infection with worms, and so on.
Denote worm prevalence at location 𝑗𝑗 at time 𝑡𝑡 by 𝜔𝜔𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 . Given the geographic spread of

worm infections by 𝛿𝛿 kilometers per year, 𝜔𝜔𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 will be a non-decreasing function of worm

prevalence at time 𝑡𝑡 − 𝑡𝑡̃ at all locations within radius 𝛿𝛿𝑡𝑡̃. Thus given the results in Miguel and

Kremer (2004), worm infection prevalence after the decade-long gap between treatment and the
follow-up survey in our study will potentially be reduced by worm treatment within a distance of
at least 30 km (=10 years x 3 km per year) and perhaps beyond. And while, of course, these
effects may fade over time, no school in our study area of roughly 15 km by 40 km can be
considered a “pure control” in the presence of these externalities.
It is straightforward to generalize the bounding result above to the empirically relevant
case of an extended follow-up period. Denote the time period of the original deworming program
as 𝑡𝑡 = 0, and subsequent years take on values of 𝑡𝑡 = 1, 2, 3, … 𝑡𝑡 ∗ , where 𝑡𝑡 ∗ is the period of the

14

follow-up survey. While in the short-run (as in Miguel and Kremer 2004) the cross-school local
treatment saturation measure due to the deworming program (𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗,0,𝛿𝛿 ) is likely to fairly accurately
capture the magnitude of the externality impacts, over time the infection “feedback” effects

generated in all directions among nearby schools would lead us to understate the magnitude of
the true cross-school externalities. Determining the magnitude of all these externality effects is
beyond the scope of this paper, as the spatial and temporal variation in our data do not allow us
to precisely estimate the wide range of potentially relevant parameters, but in Appendix B we
prove that the bounding result still holds in this case.
As noted, Miguel and Kremer (2004) report cross-school externalities up to 3 km from
the school, and at 3-6 km. There was a statistical program coding error in the construction of the
cross-school externality term in Miguel and Kremer (2004) limiting the analysis to the 12 closest
schools. Correcting the coding error does not substantively alter the estimated effects of
externalities between 0-3 or 0-4 km, since there were never more than 12 schools within 4 km,
but does lead to less precisely estimated overall effects between 3-6 km from a school; Miguel
and Kremer (2014) and Ahuja et al. (2015) contain a complete discussion of the updated
empirical results. We consider cross-school externalities up to 6 km in the analysis in this paper
for two reasons. First, we do so since spillover effects are likely to diffuse spatially over time, as
discussed above. Second, we consider externality effects out to 6 km because an F-test in a
seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) framework rejects the hypothesis that the externality
effects are zero in the 3-6 km range for the outcomes we consider (P-value < 0.001), indicating
that their inclusion is appropriate (see appendix B2 for details). The main results are largely
15

unchanged using alternative specifications for the cross-school externality effect, including
dropping these terms from the analysis entirely, as we discuss below.

3.2 Estimation
The econometric approach relies on the PSDP’s prospective experimental design, namely, that
the program exogenously provided individuals in treatment (Group 1 and 2) schools two to three
additional years of deworming. We focus on intention-to-treat estimates, since compliance rates
are high, and previous research showed that untreated individuals within treatment communities
experienced gains (Miguel and Kremer 2004), complicating estimation of treatment effects on
the treated within schools. Since PRH suggest potentially different labor market effects of health
investments on males and females in low-income “brawn-based economies”, occupations are
sharply differentiated by gender in our data, and roughly twice as many women in our sample
have children compared to the men, we follow the tradition in the labor market literature of
examining prime-age women and men separately (Altonji and Blank 1999; Bertrand 2011). 4
The dependent variable is outcome 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , for individual 𝑖𝑖 in school 𝑗𝑗, in the KLPS-2 survey:
′
𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝜆𝜆1 𝑇𝑇𝑗𝑗 + 𝜆𝜆2 𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗 + 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖,0
𝛽𝛽 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

(4)

The outcome is a function of the assigned deworming program treatment status of the
individual’s primary school (𝑇𝑇𝑗𝑗 ); the treatment saturation proportion among neighboring schools
This study is registered on the American Economic Association RCT registry (#AEARCTR-0001191). We did not
register a pre-analysis plan, as they were uncommon in Economics when data collection for this study was
completed in 2009.

16

within 6 km during the original treatment phase of the PSDP (𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗 ); a vector 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖,0 of baseline

individual and school controls; and a disturbance term 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , which is clustered at the school level.
The 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖,0 controls include school geographic and demographic characteristics used in the PSDP

“list randomization”, the student gender and grade characteristics used for stratification in

drawing the KLPS sample (Bruhn and McKenzie 2009), a pre-program average school test score
to capture academic quality, the 2001 cost-sharing school indicator (described below), the total
number of primary school pupils within 6 km of the school, and survey month and wave
controls. Estimates are weighted to make the results representative of the full PSDP sample
originally in grades 2-7, taking into account the sampling for KLPS and the tracking strategy.
One issue with employing local saturation rates as an explanatory variable in practice is
that they are a function of the local treatment decisions of households in the relevant local area,
leading to possible endogeneity concerns, for instance, if take-up is higher in areas where people
have unobservably better labor market prospects. To address these concerns we construct the
local saturation measure 𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗 as a function of the local coverage rate 𝑅𝑅𝑗𝑗 of treatment school pupils

within 6 km of school 𝑗𝑗, which is exogenously determined by the experimental design, times the
average take-up rate of deworming drugs in the entire sample at the full subsidy level. This
implies that variation in the local saturation variable is driven entirely by the experimental
design, with the average take-up rate serving as a useful “rescaling” to allow for a more
meaningful interpretation of the magnitude of estimated effects.

17

The main coefficient of interest is 𝜆𝜆1 , which captures gains accruing to individuals in

treatment schools relative to the control; since deworming was assigned by school rather than at
the individual level, some of the gains in treatment schools are likely due to within-school
externalities. This is an attractive coefficient to focus on since it is a lower bound on the overall
effect of deworming (Proposition 1). Another coefficient of some interest is 𝜆𝜆2 , which captures

the spillover effects for nearby schools, following the approach in Miguel and Kremer (2004), in
which cross-school externalities are estimated by taking advantage of variation in the local
density of treatment schools induced by the randomization. As explained further in that paper,
since reinfection rates are high in the area, the magnitude of externality effects may be either
larger or smaller than the effect of own-school treatment. We have analyzed other specifications,
including interactions between treatment and local saturation, and non-linearities in saturation
(appendix B), but cannot reject that 𝑇𝑇𝑗𝑗 and 𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗 are additively separable and enter in linearly.

The direct treatment effect estimates and externality effects are locally relevant to the

infection rates and treatment saturation rates in the setting we study, and while we do not find
evidence of interaction effects or non-linear externalities, it remains possible that such effects
would emerge at treatment levels outside the support of values that we observe. One case of
potential interest is one in which treatment coverage rates are even higher than those observed in
our setting, for instance, if all local schools were assigned to treatment (rather than
approximately two-thirds, as in our case). In this case, it is possible to place bounds on the costeffectiveness of deworming using our data under the highly conservative assumption that there

18

are no additional benefits from boosting deworming treatment saturation, i.e., in the notation
above that 𝜋𝜋(𝑝𝑝) = 𝜋𝜋(𝑝𝑝′ ) and 𝜆𝜆2 (𝑝𝑝) = 𝜆𝜆2 (𝑝𝑝′ ) for all 𝑝𝑝′ > 𝑝𝑝.

For concreteness, consider the case in which all estimates are based on local treatment

saturation rates in the neighborhood of 𝑝𝑝 < 1 and program coverage 𝑅𝑅 < 1. Due to

externalities, program benefits are experienced both in the schools assigned to treatment and the
control schools, and can be represented as 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅(𝑝𝑝) + (1 − 𝑅𝑅)𝜆𝜆2 (𝑝𝑝) = 𝑅𝑅𝜆𝜆1 (𝑝𝑝) + 𝜆𝜆2 (𝑝𝑝). Then

under an assumption of constant marginal per capita treatment costs (which again is likely to be
conservative given the fixed costs of setting up a treatment program), the cost of expanding local
program coverage to all schools in the area (𝑅𝑅 = 1) is 1/𝑅𝑅 times the cost of covering proportion
𝑅𝑅 of the population. In our case, this is implemented by multiplying the baseline costs of

deworming treatment by 1/(2/3) = 1.5, while the total benefits are assumed to remain
unchanged. We present bounds using this approach in section 5 below. 5

4. Results
After briefly discussing long-run health effects, we present impacts on education, labor outcomes
and living standards, by gender. Results are broadly consistent with the PRH model.

4. 1 Long-run health impacts

Of course, if 𝜋𝜋(𝑝𝑝) = 𝜋𝜋(𝑝𝑝′ ) and 𝜆𝜆2 (𝑝𝑝) = 𝜆𝜆2 (𝑝𝑝′ ) for all 𝑝𝑝′ > 𝑝𝑝, policymakers have the option of replicating a
program like that implemented in this study, in which case the relevant cost-effectiveness calculations would be
based on the costs and benefits at coverage and saturation levels found in our data.

19

While treatment dramatically reduced moderate-heavy infections in the short-run (Table I, row
1), adult helminth lifespans are typically between one and four years (Hotez et al. 2006), so the
direct effects of treatment will no longer be present a decade later in the data used in this
analysis. Any long-run effects would likely instead be due to effects on other diseases through an
immunological channel, or to the effects of changes in schooling or labor outcomes.
Although we find no long-term effects on height or body mass index in the full sample,
there is some evidence of persistent health gains in terms of self-reported health and reduced
miscarriage. Respondent reports that their health was “very good” rose by 4.0 percentage points
(SE 1.8, P < 0.05), on a base of 67.3% in the control group. We cannot reject equal effects for
both genders, but gains are slightly larger for women. We do detect gains in body mass index
among treated women (P < 0.05). Furthermore, deworming reduced miscarriage rates among
treatment group females by 2.8 percentage points (SE 1.3, P < 0.05) on a base of 3.9 percent in a
probit analysis (where each pregnancy is the unit of observation). The lack of miscarriage impact
among the partners of men in the treatment group suggests a health, rather than a living
standards, channel for the impacts estimated among sample women.

4.2 Education impacts
The medium-run follow up (Miguel and Kremer 2004) found increased primary school
participation among both boys and girls, consistent with the idea that health investment increased
the endowment of healthy time (Grossman 1972), and that for children, this increased time went
into schooling rather than working. The long-run follow up data show that treatment continued to
20

boost boys’ primary school enrollment, but that average academic performance did not improve,
with higher enrollment translating into higher rates of grade repetition but no increase in
educational attainment, and no significant differences between the treatment and control groups
in rates of passing the secondary school exam or enrolling in secondary school (Table II). We do
not have data on whether increased primary-school enrollment improved non-cognitive skills, a
possible channel for later labor market impacts (Heckman, Stixrud and Urzua 2006). Recall that
in the models in Bleakley (2010) and Pitt, Rosenzweig and Hassan (2012), deworming would not
increase secondary schooling if attractive work opportunities emerged around the time of
primary school completion (roughly ages 15 to 18) and if health investments raised the marginal
return to work as much as the discounted return to secondary schooling.
In contrast, our primary specification suggests that deworming leads to marked academic
gains for girls, increasing the rate at which girls passed the secondary school entrance exam by
9.6 percentage points (P < 0.05) on a base of 41%. This increase of roughly one quarter reduces
the existing gender gap in exam performance by half. Consistent with the model in PRH (2012),
in which positive health shocks disproportionately induce women to allocate more time to human
capital acquisition, treatment also halved the gender gap in secondary school entry, increasing
girls’ secondary enrollment by 0.325 years, or a third (appendix Table S3), and increasing
overall years of school enrollment for women by 0.354 years (SE 0.179, P < 0.10) (Table II). The
estimated increase in girls’ educational attainment is 0.261 years (SE 0.171, P = 0.13), as some
of the increased enrollment translated into increase grade repetition, as was the case for males.

21

4.3 Impact on labor hours and occupation
Average weekly hours worked in the control group are quite low, at 20.3 for men and 16.3 for
women (although many women in our sample are engaged in home production or child-rearing
activities, and time spent on these activities was not systematically collected in KLPS-2). Among
men, deworming increased time spent working by 17%, or 3.49 hours per week (SE 1.42, P <
0.05, Table III, Panel A). In contrast, estimated effects on non-household work hours among
women are small. It is worth noting that one quarter of both the treatment and control groups are
still in school by the time of the survey (Table II), and labor market outcomes are less
meaningful for this group. We next focus on a subpopulation that is largely older than school
age, which we operationalize as those who were older than 12 years old (the median age) at
baseline, and thus at least 22 or 23 years of age at follow-up: only 5% of control individuals in
this age group were still enrolled in any school at follow-up, compared to 39% among younger
control individuals. In this older subpopulation, average hours worked per week in the control
group is somewhat higher, at 28.2 hours for men and 21.7 hours for women. For this subgroup
among both genders, deworming increased time spent working by 13.0%, or 3.29 hours per week
(SE 1.80, P < 0.10), and treated men worked 3.74 more hours per week (P < 0.10). Treated
women worked 2.01 more hours per week, and although we cannot reject the hypothesis of no
effect for women, we also cannot reject the hypothesis of equal treatment effects by gender.
Deworming changes how work hours are allocated across sectors and occupations, with
important distinctions by gender (Table III, Panel B). Taking the genders together, hours in non-

22

agricultural self-employment increase by 45% (P<0.01), and results are shown by gender in
Figure II (Panels A and B). There are no statistically significant changes in hours worked in
agriculture or wage employment.
Breaking results down by gender, point estimates suggest that deworming leads men to
increase total work hours, and we cannot reject the hypothesis of equal percentage increases
across sectors (Table III, Panel B). In contrast, women increase time in non-agricultural selfemployment by 1.86 hours (SE 0.81, P < 0.05) on a base of 2.7 hours, nearly 70%, and reduce
hours worked in agriculture by 1.27 hours (SE 0.56, P < 0.05). This shift from agricultural work
into non-agricultural self-employment could potentially be interpreted as consistent with PRH,
although the evidence is not dispositive. 77% of self-employed women work in retail, which
seems less physically-intensive than agriculture, and there is evidence that retail profits are tied
to math skills (Kremer et al. 2013). However, there is no significant difference in education
levels between women working in agriculture and those in non-agricultural self-employment.
Deworming treatment also leads to shifts in occupational choice (Table III, Panel C).
Treatment respondents are three times more likely to work in manufacturing (coefficient 0.0110,
P < 0.05) from a low base of 0.005. On the flip side, casual labor – which typically does not
require regular work hours – falls significantly (P < 0.05). Manufacturing jobs require more
hours per week than other occupations: they average 53 hours per week, compared to 42 hours
for all wage earning jobs, 34 hours for self-employment and 15 hours for agriculture. Workers in
manufacturing tend to miss relatively few work days due to poor health, at just 1.1 days in the

23

last month (in the control group), compared to 1.5 days among all wage earners. Manufacturing
jobs are highly paid, with average earnings more than double those in casual labor (Table S17).
Deworming also leads to an increase in cash crop cultivation for the entire sample (Table III,
Panel C), with a gain of 1.36 percentage points (P < 0.05) on a low base of 0.73 percent.
Estimates of occupational effects by gender are less precise, but there are significant
increases in manufacturing among men and in growing cash crops among women. The
particularly large effect of deworming on physically-demanding and well-paid manufacturing
employment among men is consistent with the PRH model. There is suggestive evidence of a
shift into high work hour occupations for men but not women (see appendix C).
The increase in secondary education, non-agricultural self-employment, and cash crop
cultivation among women may reflect a desire to engage in higher productivity activities within
existing family and social constraints, which may complicate moves into manufacturing or other
lucrative male-dominated jobs. More speculatively, these may pay off in the form of higher
future earnings, even if not yet apparent in our data.

4.4 Impact on living standards
Living standards can be assessed using data on either consumption or earnings. We do not have
data on overall consumption, but do have data on the number of meals consumed. Treatment
respondents eat 0.095 more meals per day (SE 0.029, P < 0.01, Table IV, Panel A). The increase
in meals eaten is larger for men, at 0.125 meals/day (P < 0.01) than for women (0.051 meals),
implying that treatment males miss just under one fewer meal each week than control males.
24

Treatment effects are particularly large for the older than school age subsample (across both
genders), at 0.119 more meals per day (P < 0.01).
Total earnings are the sum of earnings in wage labor, in non-agricultural selfemployment, and in agriculture, each weighted by the proportions working in each sector. We
begin by considering total non-agricultural earnings (the sum of wage labor earnings and nonagricultural self-employment profits), which are likely to be more accurately captured than
agricultural production in this setting. Those with no non-agricultural earnings are included in
the analysis (with zero earnings). In the full sample, treatment respondents’ total non-agricultural
earnings are 15.0% higher (112 shillings, SE 96, Table IV, Panel A), although the effect is not
statistically significant. In the older than school age subsample, the effect is considerably larger
at 22.6% (278 shillings, SE 167, P = 0.101).
We next consider each source of income separately. In principle, the proportions working
in different sectors could differ by treatment group, but note that there are no significant
differences by treatment status (appendix Table S5, odd numbered columns). While weighted
earnings by sector can always be summed to generate total earnings, the treatment versus control
differences within particular sectors presented above reflect a combination of treatment and
selection effects. Treatment and control individuals work as wage laborers at similar rates and
have similar selection patterns along observable dimensions (Tables S5, S14-S15), but there are
significantly different patterns of selection into wage employment and non-agricultural selfemployment by treatment status (Table S5). This suggests that selection concerns are potentially

25

important, and that it may not be appropriate to interpret the differences between treatment and
control individuals within employment sectors as causal impacts. Recall that the consumption
and total non-agricultural earnings results above (in Panel A of Table IV) are based on the full
sample, and the issue of sorting across employment sectors does not apply.
Those working in wage employment likely have the best measured data. The distribution
of log wage earnings is shifted to right for both men (Figure II, Panel C) and women (Panel D) in
the treatment group relative to control. Log earnings (Table IV, Panel B) are 26.9 log points (SE
8.5, P < 0.01) greater. The estimated differences in earnings are larger than those of hours,
consistent with the hypotheses that treatment leads men to shift into jobs that require more work
hours and that pay better. Log wages computed as earnings per hour worked (among those who
work at least 10 hours per week) are 19.7 log points (SE 10.2, P < 0.10) greater in the treatment
group. Wage earnings differences between treatment and control are also positive among the
larger number of respondents who had ever earned wages since 2007, with an average difference
of 22.5 log points (P < 0.01) during the most recent earnings period.
The data on self-employment profits are likely measured with somewhat more noise.
Monthly profits are 22% larger in the treatment group, but the difference is not significant (Table
4, Panel C), in part due to large standard errors created by a few male outliers reporting
extremely high profits. In a version of the profit data that trims the top 5% of observations, the
difference is 28% (P < 0.10).

26

With no changes in the proportion of respondents in different sectors, and estimated
increases in earnings of more than 20% among wage earners – and similar (if less precisely
estimated) profit increases among the self-employed – treatment will have increased overall
earnings unless agricultural earnings declined. Unfortunately, we lack sufficient data on
agricultural earnings to perform a direct test. However, several patterns suggest that it is unlikely
agricultural earnings declined, and highly unlikely that they declined sufficiently to outweigh the
gains in other sectors. Recall that cash crop cultivation increased, and that hours worked in
agriculture did not change. Most importantly, if agricultural productivity had declined, one might
expect that food consumption among those working in agriculture would decline, but there is in
fact an increase of 0.065 meals (SE 0.033) in this group (appendix C).

4.5 Heterogeneous Treatment Effects and Alternative Specifications
While statistical power is limited, we do not find strong evidence of heterogeneous treatment
effects on education, labor market or living standards outcomes by baseline school grade, local
treatment saturation, or the presence of schistosomiasis (as proxied for by distance to Lake
Victoria, see appendix section C.4 and Tables S6-S13).
Estimated deworming impacts are largely robust to whether or not we account for the
cross-school spillovers at all, and to accounting for cross-school externalities at different
distances (appendix Tables S6-S9, column 5). Appendix Figure S4 shows that effects typically
remain statistically significant across alternative specifications of the externality effects for key
outcome measures (although for the “passed primary exam” outcome for females, P-values range
27

from 0.02 to 0.26). The externality results are similar if we focus on the number of local pupils,
rather than the proportion, in treatment schools (appendix Tables S6-S9, column 2).

4.6 Accounting for multiple inference
To further assess robustness, we next account for multiple inference, and then examine two
additional sources of variation in exposure to deworming.
Appendix Tables S18-S21 present the false discovery rate adjusted q-values (analogues
to the standard P-value) that limit the expected proportion of rejections within a set of
hypotheses that are Type I errors (Benjamini, Krieger and Yekutieli 2006; Anderson 2008). Key
results are robust to this adjustment: taking both genders together, the deworming impact on
meals eaten and labor earnings is statistically significant at the 1% level (q-value < 0.01), on total
hours worked in non-agricultural self-employment and manufacturing employment is significant
at the 5% level, and the reduction in casual labor jobs, the increase in cash crops, and trimmed
self-employed profits are significant at the 10% level. There is less power with the gender
subsamples but most key results continue to hold at the 10% level (appendix section C.5).

4.7 Variation in cost-sharing
Because the temporary 2001 deworming treatment cost-sharing program substantially reduced
take-up, it provides an additional, orthogonal source of variation in treatment, albeit with less
statistical power. Reassuringly, the estimated effect of cost-sharing has the opposite sign of the
main deworming treatment effect for 26 of the 30 outcomes presented in Tables I-IV (excluding
28

the first outcome in Table 1, which was measured before cost-sharing was introduced), and this
pattern seems extremely unlikely to occur by chance. In addition, stacking the data and using
seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) estimation across outcomes, we reject the hypothesis that
the cost-sharing coefficients are zero (P<0.001); see appendix section B for further details.

4.8 Cross-school treatment externalities
Cross-school externalities provide a third source of exogenous variation in exposure to
deworming. Several of the externality effect estimates in Tables I-IV are significant and large in
magnitude, including for miscarriage, manufacturing employment, and meals eaten (P < 0.05).
Under the null hypothesis of no epidemiological externalities, there should be no correlation with
the direct treatment effect. In 26 of the 30 post-2001 specifications in Tables I-IV, the sign of the
treatment effect and the cross-school externality effect are the same, which is extremely unlikely
to occur by chance; an alternative test estimates a correlation of 0.750 between the t-statistics for
the direct effect and the externality effect across outcomes (P-value < 0.001); and using SUR, we
reject the hypothesis that the 0-6 km cross-school externality effects are zero (P<0.001); see
appendix B. The existence of cross-school externalities provides additional evidence on the
robustness of the deworming impacts, and reassurance that estimated effects are not simply due
to some form of reporting bias in the treatment schools.

5. The Rate of Return and Fiscal Impacts of Deworming Subsidies

29

The estimated impacts of deworming on labor market outcomes, combined with other data, allow
us to estimate the internal financial rate of return and fiscal impacts of deworming subsidies.
We observe only a snapshot of labor market outcomes at the time of the follow-up
survey, rather than the whole path of future hours and earnings, and thus the calculations in this
section are by necessity somewhat speculative. We adopt what we consider to be a reasonably
conservative approach in bounding the effect of lifetime income. In particular, we base our
calculations on differences in hours worked between the treatment and control groups. This is
likely to be conservative for a number of reasons: 1) estimated differences in earnings among
wage workers are larger than differences in hours (Table IV, Panel B); 2) among women,
treatment is associated with greater educational attainment and higher test scores, and it seems
plausible that this could lead to higher future earnings, particularly if education and experience
are complements (Card 1999); 3) there is increased non-agricultural self-employment,
particularly among women, and it seems plausible that some of this consists of investments that
could pay off in increased earnings later; and 4) estimated effects on hours worked and nonagricultural earnings are larger among those who are older and more likely to be out of school.
For projections about the future path of earnings and thus government revenues, we
examine the following expression:

30

𝑡𝑡=50

𝑆𝑆2 𝑄𝑄(𝑆𝑆2 ) − 𝑆𝑆1 𝑄𝑄(𝑆𝑆1 ) < � 𝑁𝑁𝛾𝛾 [ 𝜏𝜏(𝑆𝑆1 ) � (1⁄(1 + 𝑟𝑟))𝑡𝑡 𝑤𝑤𝑡𝑡 �𝜆𝜆1,𝛾𝛾 + 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝2,𝛾𝛾 ⁄𝑅𝑅�
𝛾𝛾

𝑡𝑡=50

𝑡𝑡=0

(5)

−𝐾𝐾 � (1⁄(1 + 𝑟𝑟))𝑡𝑡 Δ𝐸𝐸�𝛾𝛾𝛾𝛾 (𝑆𝑆1 , 𝑆𝑆2 ) ]
𝑡𝑡=0

The left hand side is the fiscal cost to the government of increasing a deworming subsidy
from S1 to S2, which in turn may affect deworming take-up Q; take-up is non-decreasing in the
subsidy. To compute this, we use information on take-up at different price levels from Kremer
and Miguel (2007), and current estimates of per pupil mass deworming treatment costs (provided
by the NGO Deworm The World) of $0.59 per year. The total direct deworming cost then is the
2.41 years of average deworming in the treatment group times this figure, or 𝑀𝑀 = $1.42 per

person treated and $1.07 per pupil in a deworming treatment school, given average take-up of
75%. Under partial deworming subsidies, as implemented in the 2001 cost-sharing program,
individuals paid an average of $0.27 for the medicines, so the direct cost to the government
would be $1.15 for each fully dewormed individual over 2.41 years. In Table V, Panel A, we
compare these subsidy levels with the default case of no subsidies, 𝑆𝑆1 = 0.

The right hand side captures the implications for government revenue of increasing the

subsidy from S1 to S2. 𝑁𝑁𝛾𝛾 is the fraction of individuals in the sample of type 𝛾𝛾 ∈ Γ, which we

operationalize as gender, following the empirical analysis. The first term in the square brackets
captures the increase in tax revenue generated by any increase in work hours: 𝜏𝜏(𝑆𝑆1 ) is the
prevailing tax rate; r is the per period interest rate; wt is the wage rate in year t; 𝜆𝜆1,𝛾𝛾 is the

estimated deworming impact on work hours in treatment schools for gender γ ; 𝜆𝜆2,𝛾𝛾 is the
31

estimated externality effect; and p and R denote the program’s saturation and coverage, as above.
These gains are captured over an individual’s working life, which we take to be 50 years.
The second term in the square brackets accounts for the fact that improved child health
may lead the government to accrue additional educational expenditures, for instance, if
secondary schooling rates increase for type γ, which we find for females. Let K capture the cost
of an additional unit of schooling, and Δ𝐸𝐸�𝛾𝛾𝛾𝛾 (𝑆𝑆1 , 𝑆𝑆2 ) denote the average increase in schooling for
type γ when the deworming subsidy increases from S1 to S2. To compute the right hand side of
eqn. 5, we use a combination of estimates from this paper and other Kenyan data. The hours
worked estimates (Table III) indicate that treatment group males work 3.49 more hours per week
(𝜆𝜆1,𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 = 3.49), whereas the treatment effect estimate for women is near zero (𝜆𝜆1,𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 =

0.32). The point estimate of the increase in work hours due to epidemiological externalities is

10.20 hours/week for an increase in treatment saturation from 0 to 100%, and we combine this
information with each school’s local density of treated pupils to determine 𝑝𝑝𝜆𝜆2,𝛾𝛾 . 6 Since this

externality estimate is not significant at conventional levels, we focus on the case of no

epidemiological externality (𝜆𝜆2,𝛾𝛾 = 0) in panel B, and present results in Panel C assuming the

externality has the estimated magnitude for completeness. We examine the impact of a program
that treated two thirds of local schools, as in the PSDP, and scale up externality gains by the
inverse of the coverage rate (1/𝑅𝑅) since the control group also benefits from externalities.

Results are similar when externalities are disaggregated by gender (not shown).

At the time of writing, the Government of Kenya pays 11.85% interest on its sovereign
debt and inflation is approximately 2%, so we set the real cost of capital 𝑟𝑟 to 9.85%. 7 We assume
that the sample population begins working ten years after they first began receiving deworming

and retires after 40 years of work. 8 From year 10 post-treatment onwards, we combine estimated
𝜆𝜆1,𝛾𝛾 and 𝜆𝜆2,𝛾𝛾 values from Tables III-IV above with the pattern of lifecycle earnings reported in

the most recent publicly available data, the 1998/1999 Kenya Integrated Labour Force Survey,
and assume recent Kenyan economic growth trends continue. This forward projection of
earnings is necessary given the limitations of existing data, and implies that the calculations that

follow are somewhat speculative. We also assume the initial starting wage w is $0.17 per hour,
which is a weighted average of wages by sector in our data and the mean Kenyan agricultural
wage in Suri (2011), with weights corresponding to control group mean hours per sector (Table
IV). 9 Kenyan taxes (mainly on consumption) absorb roughly 16.6% of GDP so we set the tax
rate under no subsidy to 16.6%. 10
We estimated deworming impacts on school enrollment by gender and year (appendix
Table S3), and also gathered detailed information on current teacher salaries and class sizes from
See http://www.centralbank.go.ke/securities/bonds/manualresults.aspx and World Bank Development Indicators.
This is a conservative assumption since other potential funders of deworming subsidies (e.g., international
organizations, private donors) are likely to face lower interest rates; use of a lower interest rate greatly increases the
returns to deworming in the calculations described below.
8
This ten year gap roughly corresponds to the time elapsed from the start of PSDP until the KLPS2 survey (200709). By ignoring the time before KLPS2 data was collected, it underestimates gains due to greater work hours prior
to the survey. Yet it misses any reduction in work hours due to substitution of school for work. However, existing
estimates of child labor productivity suggest these foregone earnings are likely to be small (Udry 1996).
9
In Suri (2011), the mean agricultural wage is $0.16, and the control group mean is $0.23 (Table IV, Panel B) for
those working for wages. Self-employed wages are calculated by dividing control group monthly profits (Table IV,
Panel C) by 4.5 times the hours worked per week among those working in self-employment, for a wage of $0.14.
10
From World Development Indicators, government expenditures are roughly 19.5% of GDP, and from
http://blogs.worldbank.org/africacan/three-myths-about-aid-to-kenya about 15% of government expenditure is
financed from donors, thus 0.195*0.85=0.166.

the Ministry of Education, allowing us to estimate per capita schooling costs 𝐾𝐾 for both primary

and secondary schooling. Because the PSDP program did not increase the number of teachers or
classrooms in primary schools, and there is no reason to believe the Kenyan government adjusted
these factors in response to the program (based on our observations as well as on discussions
with local officials), any costs of increased classroom congestion at the primary level due to
deworming would have been incurred by students in these schools and thus is already captured in
the labor market outcomes in our data. We therefore focus on measuring the fiscal costs to the
government of increased secondary school enrollment, since these costs would be incurred either
by the government (by paying for additional teachers) or by secondary school students. Teacher
salaries constitute the bulk of recurrent government education spending, at over 90% of
secondary school spending (Otieno and Colclough 2009), and most other expenses are
traditionally covered by tuition and local parent fees. We factor in the costs that the government
would need to incur in order to maintain the secondary school pupil-teacher ratio, using our
estimated per student secondary school teacher cost of $116.85 per year (Table V, Panel A).
𝑡𝑡=50(1⁄
Assuming no externality gains, ∑𝛾𝛾 𝑁𝑁𝛾𝛾 ∑𝑡𝑡=0
(1 + 𝑟𝑟))𝑡𝑡 𝑤𝑤𝑡𝑡 𝜆𝜆1,𝛾𝛾 = $142.43, implying

that individuals gain an average of $119 in take-home pay and the NPV of government revenue
increases by $23 per person (Table V, Panel B). The additional public educational costs incurred
are estimated to be approximately $10.71, so the net increase in government revenue is $12.90,
far greater than the $1.07 subsidy. If deworming also generates positive externalities, the
earnings gains are much larger, with a per capita net increase in government revenue of $102.97
(Panel C).
34

A policy relevant case is one in which the coverage (𝑅𝑅) of the population assigned to
deworming increased from the roughly two thirds in our study sample up to all local primary
schools, as in a national mass treatment program. In that case, the relative cost-effectiveness of
the program could depend on the degree to which total program treatment effects depend on
local treatment saturation, i.e., on the shapes of both 𝜋𝜋(𝑝𝑝) and 𝜆𝜆2 (𝑝𝑝), something we cannot

directly estimate (the 10-90 range for saturation rate 𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗 in our data is 0.427 to 0.599). However,
we can bound the cost-effectiveness of a program that covered the entire population under the
conservative assumption that there are no additional net benefits from boosting the treatment
rate. The cost per treatment school student (under full subsidies) would rise by 50% from $1.07
to $1.60 while the NPV net increase in government revenue would remain unchanged at $12.90,
implying that a program treating all schools would also be cost effective.
In terms of other extensions, our model assumes a linear income/consumption tax but the
result is robust to a range of alternative assumptions on taxation, including the possibility of a
lower tax rate in our predominantly rural sample; see appendix section C for further discussion.
A standard approach to assessing the desirability of a program is to calculate the social
internal rate of return (IRR), which solves for the interest rate that equates the NPV of the full
social cost and all earning gains, whether taxed or untaxed: in the above notation, 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀(𝑆𝑆) =

𝑡𝑡=50(1⁄
𝑡𝑡 �
∑𝛾𝛾 𝑁𝑁𝛾𝛾 �∑𝑡𝑡=0
(1 + 𝑟𝑟))𝑡𝑡 𝑤𝑤𝑡𝑡 �𝜆𝜆1,𝛾𝛾 + 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝2,𝛾𝛾 ⁄𝑅𝑅� − 𝐾𝐾 ∑𝑡𝑡=50
𝑡𝑡=0 (1⁄(1 + 𝑟𝑟)) Δ𝐸𝐸𝛾𝛾𝛾𝛾 (0, 𝑆𝑆)�. The

annualized social IRR with no health spillovers (𝜆𝜆2,𝛾𝛾 = 0) is very high at 31.8%, and with health
spillovers is a massive 51.0%.

35

These fiscal and IRR calculations are speculative for several reasons, including the
projection of future earnings, as noted above. This exercise also ignores broader general
equilibrium effects of a mass national deworming program on wage levels and the capital stock;
these macroeconomic effects could theoretically either increase or decrease the effects we
present in this section, although they seem unlikely to overturn the main patterns (appendix C
contains a discussion). They are also relatively imprecisely estimated: we bootstrapped standard
errors (with 1000 runs), and find that net revenue gains are less than zero 29% of the time for the
case of no health spillovers. So while estimates indicate that the expected net revenue effects of
deworming are large, there remains considerable uncertainty around these estimates.
Yet these calculations are also conservative in several dimensions. For one, note that
even in cases where the net revenue effects are not positive, the gains in the labor market due to
deworming help partially offset the original expenditure outlay on deworming subsidies,
substantially reducing their net fiscal cost. The fiscal and internal rate of return exercises above
also only rely on income and ignore any welfare gains through other channels. It is plausible that
those who had better health and nutrition as a result of deworming benefited from an increased
endowment of healthy hours, and experienced direct utility gains from simply feeling better, and
the same could be said for any inherent welfare benefits of increased schooling. Finally, we do
not incorporate recent evidence that positive deworming externalities extend beyond those in our
sample to other age groups: Ozier (2014) finds that living in a deworming treatment community
early in life (age 0 to 2) leads to improved cognitive and academic performance ten years later.

36

Older individuals in the area also plausibly benefited from the health spillovers of treatment but
we lack data to quantify any such gains.

6. Conclusion
Previous work (Miguel and Kremer 2004) found that a primary-school deworming program
increased school participation. This paper shows that some education and labor market outcomes
improve one decade after receiving deworming. These gains could have substantial positive
welfare impacts for households living near subsistence, like many in our Kenyan sample. A
conservative estimate of the annualized financial internal rate of return (IRR) to deworming is
high at 31.8%. Our best estimate is that deworming subsidies will generate more in future
government revenue than they cost in up-front expenditures. 11
The high rate of return to deworming in our Kenyan context is consistent with the finding
of sizeable deworming impacts on education and incomes in the 20th century U.S. South
(Bleakley 2007; Bleakley 2010), and recent evidence on positive long-run educational impacts in
East Africa in Ozier (2014) and Croke (2014). Of course, there is uncertainty around our
estimates and returns could differ in other environments, but even given some uncertainty, or
substantial weight on priors that the returns to deworming are smaller, this growing body of

Some have argued that certain other public health investments could also have this property, including tobacco
cessation (Lightwood and Glantz 2013) and reduced drunk driving (Ditsuwan et al. 2013).
11

evidence suggests that the expected financial rate of return would likely exceed conventional
hurdles for public health investment (Ahuja et al. 2015).
The results also have implications for several related literatures. Many studies argue that
early childhood health gains in utero or before age three have the largest impacts (Almond and
Currie 2010) and some have argued that interventions outside a narrow window of child
development will not have major effects. Our evidence suggests that health interventions among
school-aged children, which are too late in life to affect cognition or height, can have long-run
impacts on labor outcomes by affecting the amount of time people spend in school or work.
While there is a literature on differences in work hours across wealthy countries (Prescott
2004), the determinants of labor hours in poor countries are less studied. Work hours are quite
low in some low-income settings (Fafchamps 1993), including among our control group. The
findings here suggest that poor child health may be one factor behind this low adult labor supply.
Finally, our analysis does not account for potential negative externalities from
deworming through drug resistance. Geerts and Gryseels (2000) and Geerts and Gryseels (2001)
highlight mass deworming policy approaches that could minimize the development of resistance,
and while there is limited current evidence on drug resistance related to human deworming, it has
been documented in livestock (Albonico, Engels and Savioli 2004). Despite their concerns,
Geerts and Gryseels (2001) do still conclude that community-based mass deworming treatment
makes sense in high morbidity settings, such as our Kenyan study area, and we agree it is
unlikely that resistance would be large enough to overturn the case for subsidies. Worm
38

prevalence is likely to decline over time with economic development, as more people have
sanitation facilities, wear shoes, and take other actions to avoid infection, and it is therefore
unlikely to be optimal to hold back on treating the sick today in order to “save” the drug for later.
Moreover, if there is a need to cut back on drug administration to reduce the risk that resistance
will develop, cutting back on veterinary use in high-income countries may be a more appropriate
initial response.

Notes: The sample includes all individuals surveyed in KLPS-2 (2007-2009), except for the moderate-heavy worm infection data, which is from the 2001 PSDP
parasitological survey. Each entry in columns 1-3 is from a separate OLS regression, except the miscarriage outcome, which are marginal probit specifications in
which each observation is a pregnancy. All observations are weighted to maintain initial population proportions, except for the 2001 moderate-heavy worm
infection results. Standard errors are clustered by school. Significant at 90% (*), 95% (**), 99% (***) confidence. The coefficient on the deworming treatment
indicator term is 𝜆𝜆1 in equation 1. The cross-school externality term is the “saturation rate” – the number of treatment group (Group 1,2) pupils within 6 km
divided by the total number of primary school pupils within 6 km, multiplied by the average deworming take-up rate in the sample – demeaned, and the
coefficient on the externality term is 𝜆𝜆2 in equation 1. All regressions except for the first include controls for baseline 1998 primary school population,
geographic zone of the school, survey wave and month of interview, a female indicator variable, baseline 1998 school grade fixed effects, the average school test
score on the 1996 Busia District mock exams, total primary school pupils within 6 km, and the cost-sharing school indicator. The first row includes controls for
baseline 1998 primary school population, geographic zone of the school, a female indicator variable, baseline 1998 school grade fixed effects, the average school
test score on the 1996 Busia District mock exams, and total primary school pupils within 6 km. Self-reported health “very good” takes on a value of one if the
answer to the question “Would you describe your general health as somewhat good, very good, or not good?” is “very good”, and zero otherwise. Sixteen
unreasonably low values for height are dropped, but the height results are substantively the same if these are not dropped. Sixteen unreasonably high values (at
98 and above) for BMI are dropped (these are the same 16 observations that were dropped for height); note that the female BMI effect estimate is not statistically
significant at traditional confidence levels if these observations are retained (not shown).

Notes: For details on the regressions, see the notes for Table I. Each entry in columns 1-3 is from a separate OLS regression, except for “total employees hired”
in Panel C, which utilizes a negative binomial regression. “Older than school age” denotes those older than 12 years of age (the median age) at baseline in 1998.
Real earnings measures account for the higher prices found in the urban areas of Nairobi and Mombasa. We collected price surveys in both rural western Kenya
and in urban Nairobi during KLPS-2, and base the urban price deflator on these data; results are unchanged without this price adjustment. The total nonagricultural earnings measure in Panel A includes those with zero reported earnings and profits. The wage, earnings and profits results in Panels B and C are
among those who reported wage employment or non-agricultural self-employment, respectively. When computing wages, we exclude those with fewer than 10
hours per week to address division bias from noise in estimation of number of hours worked. “Total employees hired” is among those who are self-employed.

Notes: The deworming cost is US$0.59 per year, and the average number of years treated was 2.41 years. Figures in Panels B and C are relative to the “no
subsidy” case. We use a starting hourly wage rate (w) of $0.17, a weighted average of wages by sector with weights corresponding to control group mean hours
per sector (Table IV). We use Suri’s (2011) mean wage of $0.16 as the agricultural wage, and the control group mean of $0.23 (Table IV, Panel A) for those
working for wages. Self-employed wages are calculated by dividing control group monthly profits (Table IV, Panel B) by 4.5 times the hours worked per week
among those working in self-employment, for a wage of $0.14. The public finance data is from the Kenyan Central Bank website and the World Bank
Development Indicators. The NPV of per-person lifetime earnings in the no subsidy and no health spillovers case is $1,509.96. We assume that earnings start 10
years after deworming treatment and continue for 40 years. Life cycle earnings profiles for Kenya are created using data from the 1998/1999 Kenya Integrated
Labour Force Survey, by regressing individual earnings on age, age squared, and indicator variables for female, attained a schooling level of
primary/secondary/beyond, and province of residence. Future earnings are also assumed to increase by the average per-capita GDP growth rate in Kenya during
the 2001 to 2011 period, namely 1.52% per annum (World Bank Development Indicators).
