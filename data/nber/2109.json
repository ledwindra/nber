Furthermore, in such models monetary factors can affect the long-run behavior or real output, contrary to the commonly held view that they can't. Real business cycle models and Lucas-type models are different paradigms not in the sense of real versus monetary, but in the interrelation- ships between real and monetary factors intrinsic to the Lucas paradigm as contrasted to the dichotomy between real and monetary factors implied by the real business cycle literature.\n\n",
