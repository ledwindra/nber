The Effect of an Increase in Autism Prevalence on the Demand for Auxiliary Healthcare Workers:
Evidence from California

ABSTRACT
Autism is a developmental disorder characterized by impairments in social interaction, communication,
and restricted or repetitive behaviors. This previously rare condition has dramatically increased in
prevalence from 0.5 in 1000 children during the 1970s to 11.3 in 1000 children in 2008. Using data
from the California Department of Developmental Services, we study how changes in the number
of autism cases at each of the 21 regional development centers affected local wages and quantity of
auxiliary health providers. We focus on this subset of health providers because, unlike physicians and
psychologists who can diagnose autism, these workers cannot induce their own demand. If the incidence
of autism is increasing independently of other mental disorders, then the demand for auxiliary health
providers should increase, leading to higher wages and an increase in the number of these providers
over time, else the increase in autism diagnosis is merely displacing other mental disorders. Using
wages and provider counts from the American Community Survey, we find a 100% increase in the
number of autism cases increases the wage of auxiliary health workers over non-autism health occupations
by 8 to 11 percent and the number of providers by 7 to 15 percent the following year. Further, we find
that four additional autism cases reduces the number of mild mental retardation cases by one, but is
not found to have a statistically significant effect on the level of cerebral palsy or epilepsy.

Introduction
Autism is a developmental disorder characterized by impairments in social interaction,

communication, and restricted or repetitive behaviors (American Psychiatric Association, 1994).
The previously rare condition has experienced a dramatic increase in prevalence from 0.5 in
1000 children during the 1970s to 11.3 in 1000 children in 2008 (Baio, 2012). Currently, autism
is only second to mental retardation as the most commonly diagnosed developmental disability
(Yeargin-Allsopp et. al., 2003; Bhasin et. al., 2006). Further the cost associated with caring for
individuals with autism is not trivial. The annual costs of care for a child with autism are
estimated to be 85% to 550% higher than the cost for a typically developing child and the
average lifetime public expenditures are approximately $4.7 million (Guevara et. al., 2003;
Jacobson et. al., 2000). This increase in prevalence, compounded with the cost of care, has
prompted many researchers to investigate various factors that could potentially explain the cause
of such an increase.
The three leading factors are an increase in environmental toxins, de novo1 gene
mutations caused by older parental age at birth, and a change in diagnosis determinants. The
latter factor has led to much debate in the medical community as researchers cannot agree on the
true incidence level of autism. The diagnosis of autism poses a difficult challenge to clinicians
in that there are no biological markers and many of the observable characteristics are shared with
other mental disorders such as Mental Retardation (MR) and Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD).
For example, King and Bearman (2009) find that roughly 25% of the increased prevalence of
autism is associated with a diagnostic change in determining mental retardation. Bishop et al.
(2008) studies adults with a history of development language disorder and finds that one-third of

1

De novo mutations are deletions, insertions, and duplications of DNA in the germ cells (sperm or egg) that are not
present in the parents’ DNA.

3

adults previously diagnosed with Development Language Disorder would have been diagnosed
with autism using contemporary techniques.
In this paper, we use economic theory to help shed some light on the debate. If the
incidence of autism is increasing independently of other mental disorders (such as mental
retardation), then the demand for auxiliary health providers (e.g. speech pathologist, behavioral
therapist, occupational therapist, etc.) should increase leading to higher wages for these providers
and an increase in the number of providers. On the other hand, if the increase in autism
diagnosis is merely displacing other mental disorders, then the effects of the increase on demand
will be mitigated or not present as individuals are only changing diagnostic labels but
maintaining the same level of services demanded. We construct an econometric model to
distinguish between these two effects.
Using data from the California Department of Developmental Services, we study how
changes in the number of autism cases at each of the 21 regional development centers affected
local wages and quantity of auxiliary health providers. We focus on this subset of health
providers because, unlike physicians and psychologists who can diagnose autism, these workers
cannot induce their own demand.2 Using wages and provider counts from the American
Community Survey (ACS), we find a 100% increase in the number of autism cases at a center
increases the wage of auxiliary health workers over non-autism health occupations by 8 to 11
percent; additionally, the number of providers increases by 7 to 15 percent the following year.
II.

Background
Autism is a developmental disorder that limits an individual’s ability to form social

relations and appropriately respond to environmental stimuli. The prevalence of autism in the
United States has increased rapidly over the last 30 years. In California, the number of autism

cases increased by 1,148 percent between 1987 and 2007, which is remarkable considering that
cerebral palsy increased by 73 percent, epilepsy by 66 percent, and mental retardation by 95
percent over the same time period (Cavagnaro, 2007). However, the co-morbidity rate between
autism and mental retardation has fallen from 79.6 percent in 1987 to 35.6 percent in 2007,
which differs from national trends ranging now between 40 to 55 percent (ASD Best Practice
Guidelines, 2002; American Psychiatric Association, 2000; Chakrabarti and Fombonne, 2001).
We highlight both the rise in reported autism cases as well as the trade-off between
autism and mental retardation as these relationships are at the center of much debate. Grinker
(2007) argues that the true prevalence of autism is not rising. Rather, physicians are finally
diagnosing autism correctly. The author cites five factors causing the rise in autism cases: (1)
broader definition of autism; (2) a change in school policy allowing autistic students to receive
special education in 1992; (3) the stigma associated with an autism diagnosis decreased reducing
the number of under-reported cases; (4) states started to allow families with autistic children to
apply for Medicaid funds regardless of family income leading more families to seek care and
more physicians to “up-code” patients so they can receive funding (an advantage not readily
available for a diagnosis of mental retardation); and (5) relabeling, where due to the broadening
of the autism diagnosis fewer cases are misdiagnosed into other mental disorders such as mental
retardation and ADHD.
Mental disorders have a history of under-reporting and misdiagnosis. Elder (2010) uses
regression discontinuity methods to compare ADHD diagnosis between students who are slightly
above and below the birthday enrollment cut-off for kindergarten and finds that approximately
20% of children who use stimulants intended to treat ADHD are misdiagnosed. Epilepsy is

5

found to have a misdiagnosis rate of 26.1 percent in adults (D. Smith et al., 1999) and 39 percent
in children (Udldall et. al., 2006).
A similar pattern is observed with autism. Autism was first recognized as a disorder
associated with schizophrenia beginning in 1911 (Bleuler, 1912). This association continued well
through the 1960’s. Autism is later categorized into four individual disorders comprising the
autism spectrum: Rett Syndrome, Asperger Syndrome, Autistic Disorder, and Pervasive
Developmental Delay – Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS).
PDD-NOS is the primary source of growth within the spectrum and could be the source
of misdiagnoses. Tomanik et. al. (2007) run an experiment where independent physicians are
asked to review cases for autism. There are two groups of patients, 77 autistic patients and 52
non-autistic patients. The authors find that 21.2 percent of individuals who are not classified as
autistic receive an autism diagnosis and 23.4 percent of autistic individuals are not diagnosed
with autism. With respect to under-reporting, Liu et. al. (2010) finds the reduction in stigma
associated with autism has lead to a 16% increase in the number of reported cases between 2000
and 2005. Further, autism diagnosis rates can differ based on demographic characteristics.
Mandell et. al. (2002) uses administrative data for Medicaid patients in Philadelphia and finds
African-American children receive an autism spectrum disorder diagnosis nearly three years later
than Caucasian children, on average.
The study most related to our work is Shattuck (2006). The author analyzes
administrative data from the US special education system for students between the ages of 6 and
11 and compares how changes in the administrative prevalence of autism versus other mental
disorders affect the demand for special education classes. The author finds that the average
administrative prevalence of autism among children increased from 0.6 to 3.1 per 1000 from

6

1994 to 2003, while the prevalence of mental retardation and learning disabilities declined by 2.8
and 8.3 per 1000, respectively, over the same time period. The increased administrative
prevalence in autism is concluded to be off-set by the decrease in prevalence in other mental
disorder categories.
III.

Data
The autism data are collect from The California Department of Developmental Services

(DDS). The California DDS is the central administrating body tasked with diagnosing and
reporting mental health cases in the 58 counties of the state. The 58 counties are serviced by 21
regional centers. The service areas of these regional centers are shown in Figure 1. The data for
this study are collected from the quarterly Client Evaluation Reports, which are available for
each county or each regional center for the years 2002-2011.3 We utilize the December issue of
the Client Evaluation Reports, which includes the following client characteristics: number of
total clients, number of autism cases, number of mental retardation (MR) cases (by severity),
number of cases with physical handicap, primary language, gender, race, and age distribution.
Next, we identify the target group of auxiliary healthcare providers by non-medical
treatment therapy used. The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) provides separate
guidance manuals for autism and mental retardation.4 Both manuals encourage the use of
behavioral therapy (i.e. applied behavioral analysis), psychotherapy (i.e. The Developmental,
Individual Difference, Relationship-based Model), as well as speech and language therapy. From
these treatments, we identified the following providers: audiologists, occupational therapists,
physical therapists, and speech-language pathologists. We expand this list of providers to include

recreational therapists and respiratory therapists. The Bureau of Labor and Statistics defines
recreational therapists as individuals who plan, direct, and coordinate recreation programs for
people with disabilities or illnesses. We include respiratory therapists since some individuals
with poor brain activity report using hyperbaric oxygen therapy.
Information on provider wages and earnings is matched to these 21 regional centers for
each year. Specifically, we utilize data from the 2005-2010 American Community Surveys
(ACS) Public-Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) to compute occupation-specific wages and
earnings in California. The ACS is administered monthly by the U.S. Bureau of Census. It is
nationally-representative, and annual estimates are also representative of geographic units with a
population of at least 65,000 individuals; representative estimates of smaller areas may be
obtained by combining multiple years from the ACS-PUMS (3-year and 5-year estimates). The
PUMS comprises approximately a 1% random sample of the total number of housing units in the
nation. It thus contains information on about 1.3 million housing units and 3 million person
records in total, and yields about 360,837 persons sampled in California in 2010.
The smallest geographic unit identified in the ACS-PUMS is the Census-defined PUMA
or the Public Use Microdata Area. PUMAs are statistical geographic areas nested within states,
and which have a population of at least 100,000 individuals.5 The 21 regional centers that report
the provision of services for developmental disabilities in California are matched to the PUMAs,
based on the counties that each center serves, for 2005-2010.6 (We are unable to utilize ACS
information prior to 2005 since local-area identifiers within each state are not available in the
PUMS.) Each individual respondent reports their average total income from wages and salary in
5

There are 233 PUMAs defined for California. See the Census ACS webpage (http://www.census.gov/acs/www/ )
for information on these geographic areas and the sampling schemes of the ACS and the ACS-PUMS.

There are seven regional centers which service Los Angeles County. Aggregating these centers into a single
regional center servicing LA does not alter results (reported in Appendix Tables A1 and A3).

the past year and also their past year average total personal earnings, along with their occupation
(4-digit occupation code based on the 2002 Census). We compute mean wages and earnings and
the total number of individuals working within each occupation, for each regional center and
year. Since wages and earnings reference the past year, we match the ACS information at time
period t (referencing period t-1) with the DDS information at time period t-1, in order to assess
the contemporaneous effects on wages and earnings of the demand shock stemming from the
increase in autism diagnoses. In supplementary analyses, we also assess lagged effects on wages
in the subsequent period by matching ACS wage information at time period t (referencing period
t-1) with the DDS information at time period t-2. Since provider counts reference the year of
interview, we match ACS information on the number of providers in each occupation at time
period t with DDS information at time period t-1 to assess lagged effects on provider entry. In
addition, we append population figures and the demographic (age, race, ethnicity) composition
of the population for each center and year, derived from the U.S. Census Bureau.
Table 1 presents the means for key variables across various periods spanning our analysis
sample. Over 2004-2009, the average regional center reported 9229 clients served for mental
health disorders, 19.4% of whom were diagnosed with an autistic disorder and 54.4% were
diagnosed with mild or moderate mental retardation. Most of the clients served are minorities,
with whites representing only about 43.1% of the cases in the average center. As illustrated in
Figure 2, the percentage of autism cases has increased from 12% to 25% from 2002 - 2011.
However, the percentage of Total MR cases has decreased from 80% to 70% and the percentage
of Mild and Moderate MR cases decreased from 58% to 52%. Moreover the total number of both
autism and MR cases has grown over this time period, but the ratio of autism cases to MR cases

9

has increased from 0.16 to 0.35, and specifically the ratio of autism to Mild MR cases has
increased from 0.32 to 0.69.

Methods
The primary aim of this study is to assess whether, and to what extent, the increase in

autism diagnoses impacts the demand for auxiliary healthcare workers. Since these workers do
not diagnose autism, in contrast to physicians and psychologists, they cannot induce their own
demand.7 Any shift in autism diagnoses in the area therefore represents an exogenous shift in the
demand for their services. In the short-term, this potential increase in demand would be reflected
in the form of higher wages and salary among these workers, likely due to increased work effort
and/or a higher price for their services. This may also induce a higher entry of such providers
over time into the market area experiencing the increase in diagnoses, demand and wages.
Our main analyses therefore examine the impact of the increase in autism diagnoses on
the wages of these providers in the short-term and, in alternate specifications, the number of
providers in the subsequent period. We employ a quasi-experimental research design – akin to a
pre- and post-comparison with treatment and control groups – in conjunction with multivariate
regression methods. The following specification relates changes in wages to autism diagnoses:
(1)

Ln Wagesijt = α0 + π (Ln Autismjt) + Xjt β + Oi Ψ + Aj Ω + Zt Φ + εijt
Equation (1) posits that log wages (Ln Wages), for the ith auxiliary healthcare occupation

in center j during year t, is a function of the number of autism diagnoses (Ln Autism). The
parameter of interest is π, which captures the effects of autism diagnoses on the average wages of
those healthcare providers whose services are complementary to the treatment of autism. The
7

Parents seek out some of these alternative health workers for other symptoms such as delayed speech. The
parents take the child to a speech pathologist and the speech pathologist may recommend that the child be tested
for autism. Thus it might appear that the demand is induced, but if anything this would bias the results towards
zero because the child would not yet be counted as an autism case. Therefore, this would be an increase in
demand for the services of a speech pathologist in the absence of an increase in autism within the data.

10

parameter  represents an error term at the level of the occupation, center, and year. We utilize
a log transformation of wages and autism diagnoses, separately controlling for the countyspecific population base and the total number of cases in each center, and allowing these
coefficients to remain unrestricted. The log adjusts for the skewness of the wage and diagnoses
distributions, facilitates interpretation (in terms of elasticity), and makes the effect magnitudes
comparable across outcomes.8 We estimate models for wages using OLS. For the number of
providers, we use a Poisson regression model for two reasons. First, the discrete nature of the
outcome variable as a count of service providers makes the Poisson probability distribution
especially suitable. Second, the Poisson framework does not suffer from the ‘incidental
parameters’ problem and can accommodate fixed effects well (Cameron and Trivedi, 1998). We
adjust standard errors on the conservative side to account for arbitrary correlation within centers,
across occupations and over time.
A challenge in any such analysis relates to disentangling the effects of autism diagnoses
from other unobserved factors that may also affect the outcome. We account for such
confounding factors in various ways. First, in alternate specifications, we control for a vector of
time-varying center-specific (and county-specific) characteristics (X) including the total number
of clients served within the center’s geographic area, the racial and ethnic composition of the
center’s clients and at-need population, total population of the counties reporting to the center,
and the demographic (age, race, ethnicity) composition of the served population. It is important
to control for the racial/ethnic constitution of the county population and the clients served by the

diagnoses; 3) rate of autism diagnoses relative to various population bases.

center since research indicates substantial disparities in autism diagnoses and the age of
diagnosis across black and white families (see for instance, Mandell et al., 2002, 2009).9
Year fixed effects (Z) account for unobserved trends specific to the state of California,
including changes in public and private insurance coverage, overall economic conditions, shifts
in diagnosis criteria, and state-level policies enacted over the sample period.10 Alternate
specifications include center-specific fixed effects (A), which account for all unobserved timeinvariant local factors that may be differentially affecting autism diagnoses, clients served, and
treatment patterns across centers, and include occupation fixed effects (O), which account for
unobserved time-invariant characteristics specific to each occupation (such as working
conditions, non-monetary attributes, and stable labor demand) that may affect wages in these
occupations.
Despite these controls, the possibility remains that there may be residual unobserved
time-variant factors which potentially impact wages. We address this problem by considering a
comparison group of occupations that should not be directly affected by a shift in autistic
disorder diagnoses. Thus, any correlation between autism diagnoses and wages for these
‘control’ occupations reflects unobserved center-specific trends. This correlation can be
differenced out from the effect (π) identified in Equation (1) to arrive at a cleaner estimate of the
effects of autism diagnoses on the wages of impacted providers.
This difference-in-differences (DD) effect can be obtained directly from estimating the
following specification:

9

Mandell et al. (2002) show that among Medicaid-eligible children, white children on average receive an Autistic
disorder diagnosis at 6.3 years compared to 7.9 years for black children.
10
Insurance status is unavailable in the ACS data prior to 2008. We construct center-specific rates of public
coverage, private coverage, and uninsured for 2008-2010. Including these center-specific measures of insurance
status in models estimated over 2008-2010 does not materially change the point estimates, though standard
errors are inflated in these models due to the reduced sample size.

12

(2)

Ln Wagesijt = α0 + α1 (Targetijt) + α2 (Ln Autismjt) + π* (Ln Autismjt * Targetijt)
+ Xjt β + Oi Ψ + Aj Ω + Zt Φ + εijt

In the above equation, Target represents a dichotomous indicator equal to one for those
healthcare occupations whose services are demanded by families with autistic children, and zero
for occupations in the comparison group (providers whose services are not directly impacted by
autism diagnoses). The DD estimate of the effect of autism diagnoses is the coefficient (π*) of
the interaction term between Ln Autism and the Target indicator. This effect is identified by
comparing changes in wages associated with autism diagnoses for the target occupations in
relation to changes for the control occupations, accounting for all other observable factors.
The choice of the target group of auxiliary healthcare occupations, whose services are
utilized by families with autistic children is straightforward. As noted earlier, non-medical
interventions include behavioral, educational, sensory, and communication therapy, typically
requiring the services of healthcare providers such as a speech pathologist, behavioral therapist,
or occupational therapist.11 We therefore expect the demand for services for the following
providers to be potentially and directly impacted by a shift in autism diagnoses: 1) audiologists;
2) occupational therapists; 3) physical therapists; 4) recreational therapist; 5) respiratory
therapist; 6) speech-language pathologist; and 7) other therapists.12 Additionally, these same
therapists serve individuals with mental retardation.13

parents see http://www.autism.com/pdf/providers/ParentRatings2009.pdf
12
Occupations in the ACS are identified by the 2002 Census codes. We therefore include codes 3140
(audiologists), 3150 (occupational therapists), 3160 (physical therapists), 3210 (recreational therapists), 3220
(respiratory therapists), 3230 (speech-language pathologists), and 3240 (other therapists) in the target group.
Estimates are robust to excluding other therapists (code 3240).

13

We utilize two alternate control groups to account for unobserved trends in wages within
centers over time: 1) all other healthcare practitioner and healthcare technical occupations
(occupation codes 3000-3540); and 2) all other healthcare practitioner, healthcare technical, and
healthcare support occupations (occupation codes 3000-3650).14 The former control group
includes occupations that provide direct healthcare services to the patient. Since auxiliary
healthcare providers of services to autistic children are classified by the Bureau of Labor
Statistics (BLS) in this grouping, this control group may represent those occupations which are
most similar to those in the target group but not directly impacted by an increase in autism
diagnoses. The latter control group comprises all healthcare-related occupations, and also
includes support occupations such as aides, assistants, and other support workers. These control
groups will account for trends specific to healthcare occupations within each center and county.
However, to the extent that demand and wages for some of these other health practitioner
(physicians) and health support occupations (aides and nurses, for instance) may also be
impacted by an increase in autism diagnoses, effects may be potentially understated. We
therefore draw conclusions based on the range of estimates from both sets of control occupations
and interpret these estimates as potentially conservative effects.15
Unconditional means from Table 1 suggest that wages in occupations whose services are
complementary to autism diagnoses increased by 41.5% between 2004 through 2009. This
compares with wages for other healthcare practice occupations, which increased 27%, while
those among all healthcare occupations increased 28.4%. Thus, wages among autism service
14

Specifically, we define control healthcare practitioner and support occupations based on 2002 Census codes
3000 to 3650, excluding those defined above for the target group.
15
In supplementary analyses, as a robustness check, we also considered all other occupations (healthcare and nonhealthcare) as a global control group. Expectedly, these estimates were of a larger magnitude since healthcare
occupations (including the auxiliary service providers for Autistic children) generally enjoy stronger wage growth
relative to other jobs and effects are likely overstated, partly reflect just an overall positive trend in the wages of
healthcare occupations.

14

providers has increased relative to those among similar healthcare practice providers as well as
all other healthcare providers and support workers coinciding with an increase in the number of
autism diagnoses over our sample period, and the increase in wages is statistically significant.
We extend the model specified in Equation (2) in order to test for a ‘dose-response’
relation and to assess the plausibility of the estimates by exploiting the suggestive displacement
of other mental disorders for autism diagnoses. If the increase in the diagnoses of autistic
disorders is partly displacing other mental disorders, then the effects of the increase on demand
and wages would be mitigated. If one diagnosis is merely displacing another, then there is no
effective increase in the demand for the services of the auxiliary healthcare workers and there
should be no observed increase in their wages, conditional on trends. We therefore test whether
the demand effects are relatively larger in those areas where this displacement is relatively low,
in which case the increase in autism diagnoses is occurring independently of other mental
disorders and would lead to a net increase in demand for the healthcare providers.
Specifically, we estimate the following model separately for each of the 21 regional
centers, as part of a two-step procedure, in order to quantify the effects of higher autism
diagnoses on the diagnoses of mild mental retardation (MR).
(3)

Mild MRt =

δ + Λ (Autism)t
+ δ1 (Total Clients)t + δ2 (Center Demographics) + δ3 Trend + νt

The parameter Λ, which is estimated separately for each center, represents the association
between Autism and Mild Mental Retardation (MR), both measured as the number of total
cases.16 We multiply Λ, for each center, by -1 to obtain the magnitude of the displacement.
Thus, if the displacement is 0.5, this signifies that for every two additional diagnoses of autism,
one of these cases is displacing a displacing a diagnosis of mild MR in that center, on average.
16

Estimates are not sensitive to alternate functions forms: 1) percent of total cases; and 2) log of total cases.

15

While Equation (3) controls for trends and demographic shifts within each center, we note that
these rates should not be interpreted as causal since they may reflect residual unobserved trends.
Nevertheless, we expect to find weaker effects on the demand for services in those centers where
the displacement rate is high.
In the second step, we modify the baseline DD model (Equation 2) to allow an interaction
between the effect of autism diagnoses and the center-specific displacement rate:17
(4)

Ln Wagesijt = α0 + α1 (Targetijt) + α2 (Ln Autismjt) + λ1 (Ln Autismjt * Targetijt)
+ λ2 (Ln Autismjt * Targetijt * Displacementj)
+ Xjt β + Oi Ψ + Aj Ω + Zt Φ + εijt

The parameter λ1 represents the effect of autism diagnoses on wages, among those centers which
had no displacement of MR cases for Autism; hence, we expect λ1 to be larger than the estimated
DD effect π* in Equation (2) which represented a weighted average effect that conflates effects
for centers that have high and low displacement rates. The parameter λ2 represents the effect of
higher levels of displacement on the link between autism and wages. We expect λ2 to be
negative, since centers which have high rates of displacement would see lower demand and
hence lower wages, relative to centers which have no displacement. This specification tests the
proposition that higher autism diagnoses should only represent an effective increase in the
demand for the services of the auxiliary healthcare workers if these diagnoses represent a ‘true’
increase rather than a substitution from MR diagnoses. Standard errors for Equation (4) are
bootstrapped to account for the sampling variance in the estimate of the displacement rate.18

17

This becomes a DDD model, which we estimate as a fully flexible specification by also allowing interactions
between Displacement and Ln Autism, and between Displacement and Target.
18
Specifically, we report cluster bootstrapped standard error based on 100 replications at the center-year cluster
level. Center-level clusters provide too few clusters for the bootstrap. We note, however, that non-bootstrapped
standard errors clustered at the center-level or at the center-year level in our DD models yield highly similar
variance estimates and inferences.

Results
Table 2 shows the association between autism diagnoses and mental retardation (MR)

cases over the sample period. Model (1) indicates that a one percent increase in autism cases is
associated with a statistically significant 0.40 percent decrease in mild MR cases, suggestive of a
displacement of MR diagnoses for autistic disorder diagnoses. This displacement rate is robust
to non-parametric (inclusion of year indicators) controls for trends in California (Model 2), and
decreases slightly in magnitude to -0.34 with the addition of center-level fixed effects in Model
(3). Thus, the negative association between autism and MR diagnoses is present both across
centers (cross-sectionally) and within centers over time. Model (4) suggests a similar
displacement rate (-0.38) when moderate MR cases are considered in addition to the mild cases.
Displacement is also evident in levels (Models 5-8). These specifications suggest that about one
out of every four additional autism cases is a shift from mild or moderate MR to an autism
diagnosis. Models (9) and (10) present a placebo test and confirm that with respect to cerebral
palsy and epilepsy there is no significant or substantial displacement coinciding with an increase
in autism diagnoses. Individuals with these conditions also utilize occupational and behavioral
therapist, but unlike MR, these conditions are easier to diagnose. Furthermore, since these
conditions are also served by the developmental centers, it is possible that autism is potentially
crowding out other conditions besides MR or there is an unobserved effort by administrators to
increase autism diagnosis. However, we find no discernible displacement effect between these
conditions and autism cases at the center level.
Table 3 presents the effects of an increase in the autism caseload on wages, based on the
DD framework specified in Equation (2). Models 1-4 utilize non-autism healthcare practitioner
occupations as a control group, whereas Models 5-8 utilize an alternate control group that

17

includes all non-autism healthcare occupations (practitioner and support occupations). Model (1)
suggests that a 100% increase in autism diagnoses raises wages among the target occupations
(auxiliary healthcare providers of services to autistic clients) by 10.6%, relative to all other
healthcare practice occupations. This effect remains robust and statistically significant (at
10.9%) with the inclusion of center-level fixed effects (Model 2) and center- and county-level
demographics (Model 3). The effect magnitude decreases slightly to 8.3%, though it still
remains statistically significant, when the full set of occupation-specific fixed effects is added to
the regression (Model 4). The coefficient of Ln Autism is generally insignificant though not
necessarily insubstantial in magnitude; this suggests that the control group is indeed picking up
remaining (noisy) trends in healthcare wages within centers coinciding with the increase in
autism diagnoses. The DD estimates purge these residual trends by differencing the effects for
the control group. The coefficients of the Target indicator are expectedly negative, consistent
with the patterns suggested by the unconditional means (Table 1) that providers of healthcare
services to autistic clients in general have lower wages relative to other healthcare practitioners.
Models 5-8 indicate that the effect magnitudes of the DD estimates are highly similar
when the control group is broadened to include healthcare support workers. Specifically, these
estimates suggest that a 100% increase in autism diagnoses is associated with an 8.0-10.1%
increase in the wages of the auxiliary healthcare providers (relative to all other healthcare
occupations).
The DD effects are understated since part of the increase in autism diagnoses represents a
displacement of MR cases, in which case the increase in the demand for the services of the target
healthcare occupations is also mitigated. Table 1 suggests displacement rates of about one-third
to one-half, in which case the DD effects reported above are also understated by a similar factor.

18

If some of the increase in autism cases is merely displacing MR cases, and if an effective
increase in autism cases causally raises the demand for services of certain healthcare providers,
then we expect that accounting for the level of displacement or directly controlling for MR cases
should raise the magnitude of the wage effects. The models reported in Table 4 implement this
plausibility check.
Models 1-3 present estimates of Equation (4), which interacts the displacement rate with
the DD effect to assess whether the impact on wages is larger in those centers where
displacement of MR for autism is lower. The coefficient of the interaction between Ln Total
Autism and Target increases in magnitude to 16.6% (Model 1); it can be interpreted as the impact
of an effective 100% increase in autism diagnoses, independent of MR cases, on wages. The
effect is robust to the inclusion of area and center demographics (Model 2) and declines
somewhat in magnitude to 12.2% with the inclusion of occupation fixed effects (Model 3). It is
validating that these effects (12.2 - 16.6%) are larger, as hypothesized, relative to the effects in
Table 3 that do not account for displacement (8.3 - 10.9%). Furthermore, the coefficient of the
triple interaction term is negative and generally significant (-0.061 to -0.093), suggesting that the
effect on wages varies inversely with displacement; in those centers where the increase in autism
cases is mostly reflecting a shift from MR to autism, we would not expect large increases in the
demand for services.
Model (4) explicitly controls for mild or moderate MR diagnoses at the center-year level.
As expected, the DD effect of a 100% increase in autism cases (which now represents a pure
demand shock for related auxiliary healthcare providers) increases in magnitude, suggesting a
17.0% higher income from wages and salary. It is validating that this estimate of the wage
increase from a “pure” 100% increase in autism diagnoses is consistent with the effects emerging

19

from the DDD models (12.2 - 16.6%) noted above. It is further validating that the inflation of
the effect magnitudes in Models 1-4 in Table 4 relative to similar models in Table 3 (that do not
account for displacement) is consistent with the displacement ratios estimated in Table 2. That
is, the effect magnitudes with respect to a pure 100% increase in autism diagnoses are about 40%
larger, corresponding with a displacement rate of autism for mild/moderate MR of about 3040%. Models 5-8 suggest very similar patterns and effect sizes based on the alternative control
group of all healthcare occupations.
Table 5 presents supplementary DD models similar to Equations (2) and (3), which
inform whether an increase in autism prevalence affects the supply of auxiliary healthcare
providers in the subsequent period. Specification (5) indicates that a 100% increase in the
prevalence of autism raises the number of auxiliary healthcare workers in the area in the next
year by a statistically significant 9.2%, relative to the supply of other healthcare providers and
support workers. Controls for a full set of occupation fixed effects and center/area demographics
(Model 6) raise this effect to 11.3%.
To the extent that the increase in autism diagnoses is supplanting alternate diagnoses of
mental retardation, these effects underestimate the impact of an effective 100% increase in
autism cases. Specification (7) estimates the DDD model shown in Equation (4), including the
explicit interactions with the center-specific displacement rate. The coefficient of the interaction
between Ln Total Autism and Target suggests that, among centers that do not experience any
displacement of MR for autism and for whom the increase in autism diagnoses reflects a real
increase in the demand for services, the elasticity of provider supply with respect to autism cases
is 0.13. This effect magnitude is about 20-40% larger relative to the effects that do not account
for displacement (Models 5 and 6), consistent with the 25-35% displacement rates noted in Table

20

2. It further adds to the plausibility of this estimate that the coefficient of the triple interaction is
negative (-0.087), suggestive of a dose-response relation - though it is imprecisely estimated.
The effect of autism diagnoses on the supply of auxiliary healthcare workers is diminished with
larger displacement rates; for those centers where the increase in autism is crowding out MR
diagnoses, this increase would not be expected to substantially raise the demand for services of
workers in the target occupations. Model (8) explicitly controls for mild or moderate MR cases
in order to isolate the full effect in a different way. After accounting for MR cases, the estimate
indicates a robust 14.7% increase in auxiliary healthcare workers in the target group, relative to
the control group. Specifications (1) through (4) present similar estimates based on the control
group of non-autism healthcare practice and technical occupations. While these estimates also
suggest a similar pattern, they are imprecise and statistically insignificant.
In supplementary analyses, we also assessed two-year lagged effects on provider supply.
These estimates (not reported) suggest even larger (by about 15-20%) positive effects than those
estimated for the subsequent year in Table 5. In contrast, we do not find substantial or
significant lagged effects with respect to wages and earnings. Appendix Table A1 presents
effects of an increase in the autism caseload on wages in the subsequent period. While all of
these estimates are statistically significant, they are highly similar in magnitude to those
presented in Tables 3 and 4 with respect to contemporaneous effects. This pattern of results is
suggestive of an adjustment mechanism favoring higher wages in the short-run and higher
provider entry and labor supply in the longer-term in response to an increase in the demand for
auxiliary healthcare workers induced by a greater number of autism diagnoses.
One concern, which cannot be directly tested, is that there may be residual confounding
trends that differentially affect the target and control groups leading to biased DD estimates.

21

Table 6 indirectly assesses this possibility by implementing a placebo test based on a pseudo
target group comprised of healthcare occupations whose services (and hence wages or provider
supply) should not be directly affected by an increase in autism cases. In order to define this
pseudo target group, we chose the first seven occupations within the BLS classification of
healthcare practitioner and technical occupations that service human patients and are not
complementary to autism diagnoses. Specifically, the pseudo target group comprises the
following seven occupations in sequence in the BLS classification: chiropractors; dentists;
dieticians and nutritionists; optometrists; pharmacists; radiation therapists; and dental hygienists.
The control group represents all other healthcare practice occupations (excluding the autismrelated providers). If our DD estimates are effectively purging residual center-specific trends,
then we would not expect an increase in autism cases to affect the wages or supply of providers
in these pseudo occupational categories (relative to the control group). Indeed, Table 6 confirms
that there are no significant or substantial effects on either wages or provider supply for
occupations in this pseudo target group. This falsification check is further validating in that it
also adds a degree of confidence to the use of our control groups as a counterfactual for the target
autism-related occupations.
Appendix Table A2 presents estimates for a sample of 15 regional centers where the six
centers that service Los Angeles County are aggregated together. Appendix Table A3 presents
estimates for average annual personal earnings. All of these estimates remain robust and highly
similar, both in terms of magnitudes and statistical significance, to those discussed above.
VI.

Discussion
As the prevalence of autism has expanded dramatically over the past three decades, a

central debate relates to the various factors that could potentially explain this increase. This

22

study directly assesses whether the increase in autism diagnoses in regional developmental
disability service centers in California is associated with a displacement of mental retardation
(MR) diagnoses. We also test this proposition indirectly by examining the impact of the higher
number of autism cases on the demand for auxiliary healthcare workers – occupations whose
services are complementary to the diagnoses of autism – within a difference-in-differences
multivariate regression framework.
If the incidence of autism is increasing independently of other mental disorders, then the
demand for auxiliary health providers (i.e. speech pathologist, behavioral therapist, occupational
therapist, etc.) should increase leading to higher wages for these providers in the short term and
possibly a higher supply of these providers over time. If, on the other hand however, the
increase in autism diagnosis is merely displacing other mental disorders, then the effects of the
increase on demand will be moderated or not present.
We find robust evidence that the higher prevalence of autism in California has raised
wages and earnings among those target occupations whose services would be potentially
impacted, conditional on confounding trends. The elasticity of wages and earnings with respect
to autism diagnoses controlling for displacement effects is estimated to be between 0.11 and
0.17. This elasticity diminishes in magnitude with a higher displacement rate of MR for autism
diagnoses, consistent with mitigated demand. We find that the average displacement rate is on
the order of one-third, suggesting that one out of every three new autism diagnoses is merely
supplanting MR diagnoses and does not represent a true increase in autistic disorders. Between
2002-2011, the total number of autism diagnoses in California increased by 68.8%, adjusting for
overall time trends in access and total clients served. This suggests a 45.9% increase (assuming
a displacement of one-third) in effectively ‘new’ autism diagnoses. Combined with the above

23

elasticity estimates, this increase in prevalence would raise the wages and earnings among
auxiliary healthcare providers who provide behavioral intervention services for children with
autistic disorders by 5.0 – 7.8%. In follow-up analyses, we aim to decompose how much of this
effect reflects higher wage rates versus expanded work hours.
The short span of the data set precludes a comprehensive analysis of the effects on the
number of providers in the long run. Nonetheless, we find suggestive evidence that expanded
prevalence of autistic disorders does raise the number of auxiliary healthcare workers in the
subsequent period, with elasticity estimates ranging from 0.07 to 0.15. As with wages, we would
expect this effect to be mitigated if the increase in autism is substituting for MR cases, which is
indeed what the estimates suggest.
These results further confirm that provider income and wages are responsive to an
increase in the demand for their services. Future research should consider the mechanisms
through which these workers experience an increase in their wages, whether it be through an
increase in the price of their services and/or increased work effort and/or interaction with thirdparty payors. We note that these wage effects are not reflective of a “supplier-induced demand”
since these healthcare workers do not themselves diagnose autism and thus cannot induce their
own demand. Thus, at least part of the increase in the autism caseload represents an effective
increase in their demand given that we observe an increase in their wages. This further suggests
that at least part of the increase in autism diagnoses, about one-half to two-thirds based on the
direct and indirect estimates of displacement, reflects an increase in the true prevalence of the
disorder.

Notes: Coefficient estimates from OLS models are presented. For models 1-3 and 5-7, bootstrapped standard errors clustered within center-year cells based on 100
replications are reported. For models 4 and 8, standard errors are adjusted for arbitrary correlation within center cells. Area demographics include total county
population, percent of the population that is black, percent other race, percent Hispanic, percent ages 13 or below, percent ages 15-44, percent ages 45-64, and
percent ages 65 and over. Center demographics include total number of clients served, percent of the total clients who are white, percent black, and percent
Hispanic. In models 1-3 and 5-7 displacement represents the percent displacement of mild MR cases for Autism diagnoses, obtained from estimating Model (5) in
Table 1 separately for each center and controlling for center demographics. These models also control for interactions between Displacement and Ln Total Autism,
and Displacement and Autism Occupations. Asterisks denote statistical significance as follows: *** p-value ≤ 0.01; ** 0.01 < p-value ≤ 0.05; * 0.05 < p-value ≤
0.10.
