Benchmark Regulation of Multiproduct Firms: An Application to the Rail Industry
Wesley W. Wilson and Frank A. Wolak
NBER Working Paper No. 25268
November 2018
JEL No. L5,L9,L92
ABSTRACT
A number of formerly regulated multiproduct industries have a transitional or permanent residual
regulatory mandate to protect consumers from "excessive" prices. The legislation that deregulated
most rail rates contains a statutory mandate for the regulator to protect shippers from "excessive"
prices. Fulfilling this mandate has been challenging because of the cost and administrative burden
to shippers in obtaining regulatory relief. Moreover, as argued by Wilson and Wolak (2016), the
existing rate relief mechanism is based on a cost concept that does not reflect the actual
incremental cost of a shipment and it does not adequately address the question of what constitutes
an "excessive" rate for a multiproduct firm with significant common costs. This paper analyzes a
benchmark price approach to identifying "excessive" prices in multiproduct industries subject to
residual price regulation. Our empirical analyses demonstrate how the mechanism can be used to
fulfill the statutory mandate to protect shippers from "excessive" prices at substantially lower
cost, with less administrative burden, and without significant adverse consequences for the longterm financial viability of the railroads.

1. Introduction
A number of formerly regulated multiproduct industries have a transitional or permanent
residual regulatory mandate to protect consumers from ”excessive” prices. The Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is required to ensure that all wholesale electricity
prices are ”just and and reasonable” and ”not unduly discriminatory or preferential,” even
in parts of the United States with bid-based short-term markets for wholesale electricity.
FERC has a similar regulatory mandate for natural gas transportation despite the fact that
prices for most natural gas movements are set through bilateral negotiations between the
pipeline owner and purchaser of wholesale natural gas. In the aftermath of the Airline
Deregulation Act of 1978, the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) had a transitional mandate
to ensure that airfares were not ”unjust and unreasonable.” The Staggers Act of 1980, which
partially deregulated the railroad industry, imposes a regulatory mandate on the Surface
Transportation Board (STB), the industry regulator that replaced the Interstate Commerce
Commission (ICC), to protect captive shippers from excessive prices.
These regulatory mandates have proven challenging to enforce to the satisfaction of the
parties involved because of the conceptual difficulty in defining a ”just and reasonable” price
for a multiproduct firm with substantial economies to scope in production. Gaskins (2008)
argues that this residual regulatory challenge in the railroad industry ”still has not been
solved to everyone’s satisfaction after 150 years of effort.” (Gaskins (2008), p. 1). The
essential challenge is that a railroad provides thousands of varieties of shipments, depending
on the product and distance shipped, and both the incremental cost of a shipment and
marginal cost of shipping an additional ton exclude the vast majority of the railroad’s total
cost of production.1 This implies that setting each shipment price equal to either the average
incremental cost of the shipment or the marginal cost of shipping an additional ton of that
product would not recover sufficient revenue for the railroad to cover its annual costs.
Consequently, in order to recover its total cost of production, the railroad must charge
prices above the average incremental cost and the marginal cost of shipping an additional
ton for a substantial fraction, if not all, of its shipments. A major goal of the Staggers Act
was to grant railroads the freedom to do this, subject to protecting captive shippers from
”excessive” prices. The large number of products sold by railroads and the large share of
common costs in the railroad’s total cost of production imply that even if the railroad’s
multiproduct cost function was known with certainty, this would not make the job of setting
the threshold for an excessive price any easier. As Wilson and Wolak (2016) note, it would
only change the regulator’s problem from one of determining the value of an excessive price

management salaries and benefits, and the vast majority of labor costs.

a shipment to determining the value of an excessive markup over the average incremental
cost or marginal cost of a shipment.
The total welfare-maximizing Ramsey-pricing solution of setting the markup over marginal
cost for each shipment proportional to the inverse of the elasticity of the demand for the
shipment flies in the face of Staggers Act mandate to protect captive shippers. By definition, captive shippers have no other economically viable alternative but the railroad for their
shipment and for that reason have a small elasticity of demand for the shipment. This logic
rules out a solution that places a significant burden for common cost recovery on captive
shippers, as would be the case under Ramsey pricing.2
This paper analyzes an alternative approach to determining whether the price charged by
multiproduct firm is ”excessive” that does not require knowledge of the multiproduct firm’s
cost function or the elasticity of demand of individual products. Our methodology relies on
a set of circumstances that is increasingly prevalent in many formerly regulated industries,
the existence of a large sample of ”competitive prices” for products along with the observable
characteristics of each of these products. We use this sample to nonparametrically estimate
the conditional distribution of competitive prices given product characteristics and then
use this conditional distribution to construct a benchmark price based on the observable
characteristics of a shipment suspected of having an ”excessive” price. If the actual price
exceeds this benchmark price, then price of the shipment could be deemed ”excessive” and
therefore worthy of further regulatory scrutiny.
There are two important considerations in setting the value of a benchmark price for a
shipment. First is the probability of false positives–competitive prices that are incorrectly
found to exceed the benchmark. Second is the possibility of false negatives–non-competitive
prices that are incorrectly found not to exceed the benchmark price. We investigate this issue
with a Monte Carlo study where we first estimate the conditional distribution of competitive
prices given shipment characteristics on data simulated from ”competitive markets” and
then apply our competitive benchmark methodology using this estimated distributed to
data simulated from a mixture of ”competitive and non-competitive markets.”
Similar to the case of statistical hypothesis testing, a rule for setting the benchmark price
that minimizes the sum of squares of misclassification errors argues in favor of approach that
requires overwhelming statistical evidence against a price being the result of a competitive
market before it is deemed ”excessive.” Our Monte Carlo results finds that setting the value
of the benchmark price between the upper 5 percent and upper 1 percent of the conditional
2

For the case of zero cross-price elasticities of demand for the products sold by the multiproduct firm,
Ramsey pricing implies setting the highest markups over marginal cost for products with the smallest (in
absolute value) own-price elasticity of demand. This logic implies that captive shippers would face the
highest markups over marginal cost under Ramsey pricing.

2

distribution of competitive prices given the shipment characteristics minimizes the sum of
squared misclassification errors for range of distributions of non-competitive shipment prices.
Another important consideration in the design of our approach is the revenue impacts of
resetting shipment prices that violate the competitive benchmark at or below the competitive
benchmark price. If violations of the competitive benchmark occur too frequently and if the
mitigated shipment price is set too low then then there is a risk that this may cause a
railroad that is revenue adequate–it is earning sufficient revenues to recover its total cost
of production–to become revenue inadequate. Using the choice of the benchmark price
recommended by our Monte Carlo analysis, we explore the impact of different choices for
the mitigated or ”reasonable” shipment price in the event that an actual price violates our
competitive benchmark using actual data from the STB’s Waybill sample for four broad
classes of shipments: (1) petroleum products, (2) agricultural products, (3) coal, and (4)
chemical products.
In all cases, we find that for our choice of the competitive benchmark price, re-setting
the price charged equal to any of our three choice for a ”reasonable” price for the shipment
has a very small percentage impact of the railroad’s aggregate revenue.3 However, for all
of our choices of the ”reasonable” price, we find that the average value of the difference in
prices between the actual non-competitive price and the ”reasonable” price is a substantial
percentage of the average value of the non-competitive price, which is consistent with our
procedure providing significant rate relief to shipper facing prices that our procedure deems
are ”excessive.”
The remainder of paper first summarizes the pre- and post-Staggers Act of 1980 regulatory framework governing the railroad industry. This section summarizes the inefficiencies in
the current approach to regulating excessive prices charged to captive shippers and why we
believe our competitive benchmark pricing approach helps to overcome these shortcomings.
Section III outlines our approach to estimating the conditional distribution of competitive
prices given shipment characteristics. Section IV presents the Monte Carlo study we use to
compare methodologies for computing the value of the competitive benchmark price from
the conditional distribution of competitive prices given product and shipment characteristics.
This section then reports on the results of applying our methodology to actual data from
the STB’s Waybill sample for four broad classes of shipments in order to assess the impact
on annual railroad revenues of different approaches to re-setting an ”excessive” shipment
price. Section V discusses possible uses for our benchmark pricing mechanism in carrying
3

A less conservative approach to setting the value of the benchmark price, at for example the conditional median price for the observed shipment characteristics, will lead to many more prices being deemed
”excessive” and larger revenue losses from re-setting the actual price to this benchmark price level.

VI summarizes our results and proposes directions for future research.
II. A Brief History of Railroad Regulation
The history of regulatory oversight of railroad industry since the inception of the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) in 1887 can be divided into the pre-Staggers Act period
when prices and entry into and exit from railroad sector were regulated by the ICC and
the post-Staggers Act period when railroad price regulation and entry and exit regulation
were largely eliminated. Residual regulation of these functions was conducted by ICC until
1995, when it was eliminated by the ICC Sunset Act. This act also created the Surface
Transportation Board (STB) which currently carries out these functions. For both the preand post-Staggers regimes we highlight the challenges faced by the railroad sector and its
regulatory process. This section concludes with a discussion of why we believe our price
benchmark approach to rate regulation could reduce the cost and improve the effectiveness
of the STB’s current approach to residual price regulation.
II.1. Pre-Staggers Act Railroad Regulation
Prior to the passage of the Staggers Act, rates for all railroad shipments were subject
to approval by the ICC.4 Rate proposals were typically provided by rate bureaus composed
of railroad staff that operated cooperatively with antitrust immunity. The ICC would then
review these rate proposals and frequently prohibited their implementation or significantly
reduced them before they were allowed to be implemented. As Stone (1991) notes, rate
reductions to respond to competition from other modes of transportation were often blocked.
This regulatory structure did not encourage efficient operation of the rail network or
maximize the revenues earned by the railroads. By the late 1970s, the railroad industry
was on the brink of financial collapse, and many individual railroads were bankrupt. It was
widely held that the regulatory structure that existed at the time impeded the ability of
railroads to meet new forms of competition and impeded innovation in the industry.5
The Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 (4R Act) and the Staggers Rail Act of 1980 provided for significantly reduced federal regulatory oversight of the
railroads. This legislation introduced new mechanisms governing the regulation of rates,
allowed confidential contracts between railroads and shippers at negotiated rates, and eased
impediments to rail line abandonment and to mergers.
II.2. Post-Staggers Act Railroad Regulation
The 4-R Act and Staggers Act placed a greater emphasis on market forces to discipline

There is voluminous literature on railroad regulatory policy. Keeler (1983) provides a comprehensive
survey.

rates. The effects of these legislative changes on the railroad industry have been dramatic,
with substantial decreases in costs, rates, and the size of the rail network as well as a
tremendous consolidation of firms.6
The legislation anticipated the need to protect shippers that do not have an economically
viable alternative for a shipment. It established the notion of market dominance to protect
these so-called captive shippers from ”excessive” rates. The STB has the jurisdiction to
consider the reasonableness of a rate only if there is a finding that the railroad is market
dominant over the movement.
Market dominance is defined as the absence of effective competition from other railroads
or modes of transportation (49 USC §10707). A rate is automatically considered reasonable
if the revenue the railroad receives (R) it does not exceed 180 percent of its “variable cost,”
(VC) as determined by the Surface Transportation Board (STB) (49 USC §10707(d)(1)(A)).
If a disputed rate fails the R/VC ¡ 180 percent test and is found to be in a market lacking
effective competition, the STB can rule on whether the rate is reasonable.7 To determine the
”variable cost” of a shipment, the legislation mandated the existence of a railroad costing
methodology to construct this ”variable cost.” After years of development the Uniform Rail
Costing System (URCS) was adopted in 1989, replacing Rail Form A which had been used
since 1939. If STB finds the rate to be unreasonable, it must order the railroad to compensate
the shipper for overpayments, and it may prescribe the maximum rate the railroad can charge
for future movements (49 USC §11704(b), §10704(a)(1).)
Until recently, rate reasonableness cases had to be initiated by the shipper.8 That is,
rates would be set and the regulatory process would begin with a challenge by a shipper
after the rate was set. An aggrieved shipper then must have a rate greater than 180 percent
of the URCS ”variable costs” for the shipment and the regulatory authority find a lack of
effective competition before the reasonableness of the rate could be considered.
Currently, shippers can bring rate cases under three different methods including a StandAlone Cost (SAC), which was introduced by the ICC in 1985, and two simplified procedures
introduced by the STB in 1997, the Simplified SAC and the Three-Benchmark.9 SAC was
introduced in 1985 (Coal Rate Guidelines, Nationwide. 1985 [1 ICC.2d 520, 1985 WL 56819

(ICC)). In a SAC case, the stand-alone cost of a hypothetical railroad providing that shipment is used to establish an upper bound on the rate that is deemed reasonable for the
shipment.
The time and effort required to make a SAC claim against a railroad are substantial.
The process of determining the stand-along cost for a hypothetical railroad providing the
shipment is extremely complex with ample room for disagreement between parties about the
many assumptions underlying the calculation. Each of these points of disagreement must be
litigated at the STB, which makes the entire process both expensive and time-consuming.
The STB (2013) estimates the costs of pursuing a SAC case can exceed $5 million.10
Cost and complexity of SAC rate cases led to number of legislative and policy changes
by the STB to reduce the time and cost of filing for rate relief. In the ICC Termination Act
of 1995, Congress ordered the STB to develop expedited procedures for resolving disputes.
In response, the STB introduced the Simplified SAC and the Three-Benchmark standards in
1997. Each expedited procedure limits the evidence that parties can submit and sets a time
limit for decisions.11 These simplified procedures also limit the amount of refunds a shipper
can obtain from ”excessive” prices.
To implement the first stage of the excessive rate test, the ”variable cost” of the shipment
under consideration must be calculated, and the legislation mandates that the STB have a
costing methodology.12 The ICC had used Rail Form A, an accounting-based cost allocation
system for railroad services and activities, since 1939. Under the Staggers Act regulatory
reforms, the ICC was charged with developing an updated method to determine “economically accurate railroad costs directly and indirectly associated with particular movements of
goods, including the variable costs associated with particular movements.”13 To comply, the
ICC developed the Uniform Railroad Costing System (URCS), which was adopted in 1989
and shares a methodological approach with earlier cost accounting schemes and remains in
use today.
Wilson and Wolak (2016) examined theoretical and empirical validity of URCS methodology for computing the ”variable cost” of a shipment. They argue that it is an ad hoc
cost allocation methodology that is inconsistent with the economic theory of multiproduct
costing. Using shipment prices from the STB’s Waybill sample, the authors find many instances of railroads providing a shipment at a price that is less than the URCS ”variable
cost.” This ”irrational” behavior by railroads implied by the URCS costing methodology

and its inconsistency with the economic theory of multiproduct costing argues against the
use of the URCS ”variable cost” in determining excessive rates. Wilson and Wolak (2016)
conclude that URCS costs do not meet the law’s requirement for economically accurate shipments costs, and are therefore have little relevance to the price charged for a given unit of
traffic, contrary to their use in the law’s R/VC formula. STB’s own Railroad–Shipper Transportation Advisory Council has referred to URCS as “an outdated and inadequate costing
system.”14
Although there are inefficiencies induced by this costing system, it is mandated by legislation. In addition to being used in screening traffic for rate relief eligibility according to the
R/VC formula, URCS is used in subsequent procedures to determine market dominance, to
make assessments of whether a challenged rate is reasonable, and, if necessary, to prescribe
the maximum tariff rate a railroad may charge. URCS is also used in measuring avoidable
costs when a railroad applies to abandon a line and in calculating compensation fees for
mandated access (STB 2010, 6–8). It is also used by others to judge levels of market power
and trends in the industry.15 .
Even if the STB had access to perfect measures of the incremental cost for all possible
shipments a railroad could provide, this information would not get it any closer to determining what is an ”excessive” price or what a ”reasonable” price is for a shipment because
of the substantial fixed and common costs associated with providing rail service. Financial
viability of a railroad requires it to charge prices in excess of the incremental and marginal
cost of a shipment for as many shipments as possible in order to recover these fixed and
common costs. With perfect estimates of the incremental and marginal cost of a shipment,
the STB faces the equally challenging tasks of first determining what an ”excessive” markup
over the incremental cost or marginal cost of a shipment is and then what is a ”reasonable”
markup over these cost measures.
Our price benchmark approach explicitly addresses these challenges by using information
from shipments subject to effective competition to determine what is an ”excessive” price for
a shipment and what is a ”reasonable” price for a shipment. Our price benchmark approach
would also be significantly less costly for shippers both in terms of time and legal expense.

For example, in 2006 the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) examined trends in shipments
having rates with various R/VC percentages to determine whether railroads were obtaining and exercising
more market power over time (GAO 2006). In finding that the share of traffic having R/VCs above 180
percent had dropped from 1985 to 2004, GAO surmised that the market power of railroads had been declining.
Coincidental with these findings, however, GAO found that the amount of traffic having R/VCs exceeding
300 percent had increased from 4 to 6 percent, which caused the agency to question whether railroads were
becoming more effective in exploiting market power when they possessed it (GAO 2006, 43)

It also does not involve the use of the URCS costing methodology. It would make use of
the fact that an increasing number of shipments are occurring at negotiated rates where the
railroad faces effective competition for the shipment.
Prices for shipments from effectively “competitive” markets, are used estimate the conditional distribution of shipment prices given observable chacteristics of the shipment that account for differences in shipment costs, competitive conditions, and the commodity shipped.
We then use this estimated conditional distribution to compute a price benchmark for a
potentially ”uncompetitive” shipment based on its observable characteristics. A percentile
of the competitive price conditional distribution is the benchmark relative to which the actual rate is compared to identify non-competitive rates. This approach can be applied to all
markets, railroads, and commodities utilizing data that are easily obtained and/or collected
by the STB, primarily through its Waybill sample.
The maintained assumption behind our approach is that the conditional distribution of
prices given a broad class of product and shipment characteristics estimated from the sample
of competitive shipments provides provides a valid estimate of the distribution of ”competitive” prices given any vector of observed shipment characteristics. The STB’s relative
preference for reducing the probability of falsely finding that a competitive shipment price
is not competitive versus reducing the probability of failing to reject that a non-competitive
shipment price is competitive, determines the percentile of the conditional distribution of
competitive prices that becomes the price benchmark for determining if the observed price
for the shipment is excessive. As we demonstrate below, this process is very similar to
choosing the critical value for a statistical hypothesis test.
III. Estimating the Competitive Price Conditional Distribution
This section describes our procedure for estimating the distribution of the ”competitive”
price for a shipment conditional on the product and shipment characteristics. This conditional distribution is the essential input for computing the competitive benchmark price used
to determine whether an actual shipment price is ”excessive.” Our approach is completely
nonparametric and only relies on the existence a random sample of ”competitive” shipment
prices and product and shipment characteristics, such as the one available from the Waybill
Sample compiled each year by the STB.
The remainder of this section first summarizes our methodology for estimating the conditional distribution of the competitive price given the characteristics of the shipment.16 We
then briefly describe the Waybill data sample and how it is used to estimate this conditional

Appendix A describes the technical details of our methodology. An important step in the estimation
process described in Appendix A is the selection of the bandwidth for the kernel regression estimate of this
conditional distribution.

distribution. Finally, we describe how the estimation process can be automated to update
this conditional distribution each year with the new Waybill Sample.
III.1. Estimation Procedure
We want to estimate F (y|X), the cdf of the conditional distribution of the y, the shipment
price, given a vector X of J variables, the vector of product and shipment characteristics, using i = 1, . . . , N observations.17 We utilize the Nadaraya-Watson kernel regression estimator
of F (y|X) that accounts for stratified sampling shipments:

PN
i=1 (EFi )Ka (X − Xi )I yi ≤ y

i=1 (EFi )Ka (X − Xi )



where I(expression) is 1 if expression is true, and 0 otherwise. EFi is the expansion factor
associated with the ith observation giving the number of shipments in the population of
annual shipments that has the same observable characteristics X as this shipment.
Kernel regression is a nonparametric method for estimating the conditional mean function
of one element of a random vector, y, given the remaining elements of that random vector,
X.18 F̂ (y|X, a) is a consistent estimate of the population conditional distribution of y given
X that accounts for the fact that a stratified random sample is used to estimate F (y|X).
Given a sample of ”competitive” shipment prices, associated product and shipment characteristics and expansion factors, computing the value of F̂ (y|X) for a potentially noncompetitive shipment price and product and shipment characteristics pair (y, X 0 )0 requires
computing the N-term summation shown above. Consequently, once the vector of smoothing
parameters a described in Appendix A has been chosen, the process of updating F̂ (y|X) with
new data is straightforward to automate. Appendix A describes how the process choosing a
can be automated as well, although if the new observations are similar to the existing data
used to compute F̂ (y|X), updating the value of a may be unnecessary.
III.2. Data
The STB’s Carload Waybill Statistics (CWS) is the primary data source used to estimate
the conditional distribution of the competitive price given a shipment’s observed character17
The method we use does not involve the smoothing of y. Another method would be to smooth y and
get F (y|X) analytically by integrating f (y|X). the conditional density of y given X, over y. We found this,
however, to induce more bias into our estimate of the conditional distribution particularly in the tail of the
distribution, which we demonstrate is the portion of the price distribution most relevant to computing our
competitive benchmark price.

estimation procedure.

istics. Each year’s CWS consists of more than 500,000 randomly sampled shipments with
information on revenue, distance, shipment size, and the identity of the railroads that provided the service.
The CWS records also contain codes that can be linked with Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) Rail Network files to allow shipper and receiver locations to be identified.
Specifically, rail station records are identified by a Standard Point Location Code. These
identifiers permit mapping of origin and destination stations into the CWS and the assignment of latitude and longitude values to each shipment origin and destination. These data,
along with railroad network geographic information system data, were combined to identify locations of stations and shipment origins and destinations and to develop measures of
railroad competition.19
The data were also used in conjunction with the Port Series20 data produced by the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers to measure the presence of water competition. The Port Series
data indicate the location of ports on U.S. waterways along with the commodities handled
by each port.
All rates from the CWS were adjusted to constant 2009 dollar values by using the gross
domestic product price deflator available from Federal Reserve Economic Data through the
Federal Reserve Bank of Saint Louis.21
We use the subsample of the CWS movements that the STB has deemed are competitively
provided and therefore exempt from regulatory oversight to estimate the competitive price
condition distribution. For all of the products we consider, this subsample is composed of the
two classes of movements created by the Staggers Act: (1) exempted traffic and (2) contract
movements.22 At the time Staggers was passed our approach was not feasible in that all rates
were subject to regulation. But, Staggers allowed the regulatory authority to exempt traffic
from regulation (49 USC §10502) and it allowed the use of confidential contracts which were
not subject to regulation. Under partial deregulation, large classes of traffic were exempted
by the ICC and the contracts became widely used.
The legislation declared that the new regulatory policy would be to allow “competition
and the demand for services to establish reasonable rates for transportation by rail.” (49
USC §10101 (1)). Regulators were instructed to be aggressive in fully exempting from any
further regulatory control all traffic—truck-competitive traffic being the most obvious—for

22
Other definitions of competitively provided shipments could be used. For example, in an early version of
this methodology reported in the National Academies of Sciences report, Modernizing Freight Rail Regulation
we used exempted traffic and contract shipments with more than one railroad serving the origin or destination
or water availability transport availability at the origin or destination.

which regulation was “not needed to protect shippers from the abuse of market power.”23
Once it designated a class of traffic ”exempt,” the ICC would have no longer have control
over the rates charged to shippers or the amount and quality of service made available to
them.
For commodities that were not ruled exempt, a critical reform was the law’s legalization of
confidential contracts between railroads and shippers. Any shipment moved under contract
would be automatically excluded from any further regulation during the life of the contract;
railroads would thus be free to tailor their rate and service offerings on a shipper-by-shipper
basis.
The ability of a railroad to contract gave it substantial latitude to set rates differentially
according to a shipper’s individual circumstances and willingness to pay. Railroads would not
only be allowed to compete more aggressively for the newly exempted freight that is inherently competitive with trucks but would also be allowed to set tariff rates for the nonexempt
bulk commodities at levels equivalent to the most rail-dependent shipper’s willingness to
pay. While shippers with more transportation options would be expected to refuse to pay
the higher rate, a railroad could simply negotiate a discounted contract rate with terms
tailored to each shipper’s specific situation and willingness to pay. The price-differentiating
railroad would now be able to set rates at levels that avoid pricing any profitable traffic flows
out of the market.24
Exempt traffic and contract shipments were designed to provide the railroads with an
the opportunity earn the sufficient revenues for their long-term financial viability. Since the
passage of the Staggers Act, the share of total shipments in the CWS designed as ”exempt” or
”contract” has grown continuously, which is major factor in explaining the improved financial
condition of Class I railroads. This trend implies that the quality of our competitive shipment
price conditional distribution is likely to improve over time.
Nevertheless, shipments that are neither ”exempt” nor ”contract” and therefore subject
to the Staggers Act provision to protect captive shippers against excessive shipment rates are
likely to continue to exist. Therefore, a mechanism for determining whether a shipment rate
is ”excessive” will continue to be necessary. Our competitive benchmark approach provides
a low-cost alternative to the current approach to addressing this statutory mandate.
IV. Choosing Competitive Benchmark and ”Reasonable” Prices for a Shipment

49 USC §10502. Although the exemption provision is not explicit in identifying trucks as the competition
of interest, trucks are the only ubiquitous mode, and thus a commodity’s practical capability to be moved
by truck became the de facto standard for deciding whether a commodity should be considered inherently
competitive and granted a categorical exemption.
24
Because of the incentive to extract rents but not price traffic out of the market, the efficiency loss from
railroads having pricing freedom is expected to be minimal. Indeed, limited deadweight loss was found by
Grimm and Winston (2000, p. 65).

Our use of a price benchmark is different from the typical use of this construct in a
regulatory proceeding. Price cap regulation typically specifies a maximum price or set of
maximum prices that a price-regulated firm is allowed to charge for all of its products. These
prices are designed to allow the firm an opportunity to recover its total cost of production
through prudent operation. Yardstick regulation determines these maximum prices by using
information from a group of ”like” firms producing the same product. Again, the resulting
price benchmark is used to set the maximum price that the firm can charge for its output.
Our application differs from these uses of a benchmark price because a growing share of
shipments are provided at market-determined prices, whereas under price cap and yardstick
regulation all of the firm’s output is subject to this maximum price regulation. Our price
benchmark only determines the level of an ”excessive” price for shipments that have not yet
been definitively determined to be ”competitively” provided.
Setting the value of the ”excessive price” for a shipment involves balancing two risks. The
first is the risk of incorrectly determining that the observed shipment price is excessive when
the shipment price is the result of effective competition and the second is the risk of failing
to determine that a truly excessive price is in fact excessive. Because our benchmark price is
derived from the conditional distribution of competitive prices given shipment characteristics,
we can build on the theory of statistical hypothesis testing to determine the value of the
competitive benchmark price. Specifically, our benchmark price is analogous to a critical
value for the test of the null hypothesis that a shipment price is competitively determined
versus the alternative that it is ”excessive.”
If this null hypothesis is rejected, this raises the question what this ”excessive” price
should be reset to. This decision also involves balancing two risks. The first is the risk of
setting this price too low and increasing the probability that the railroad does not recover
sufficient revenues to cover its total production costs. The second is the risk that setting
this price too high does not protect the shipper from excessive pricing. The Staggers Act
anticipates this first risk by requiring the STB to make an annual determination of whether
each Class I railroad is revenue adequate in the sense of earning sufficient revenues to recover
its total cost of production.
This remainder of this section first presents the results of a Monte Carlo experiment to
determine the value of the competitive benchmark price that ”optimally” balances the risks
of failing to reject the hypothesis that a truly excessive price is competitively determined
versus the risk of falsely rejecting this null hypothesis for a price that is truly competitively
determined. We then use the results of this Monte Carlo study to inform our choice of the
value of the competitive benchmark price for our assessment of the impact on annual railroad
revenues of various choices of the price that that an actual price is reset to (the ”reasonable”
12

price for the shipment) if it determined to be ”excessive” using data from four classes of
products from the CWS data.
IV.1. Monte Carlo Experiment on the Selection of Benchmark Price
In order to study the impact of the choice the value of the competitive benchmark price
on the probability of each type of classification error, we require an environment where we
know with certainty whether a shipment price is competitively determined. To do this we
assume that a number of hypothetical railroads supply i = 1, . . . , N shipments, each with
demand
Di (p) = Ap−αi
where αi = zi δ + ηi . The demand shifters, zij , are assumed to be independent and identically
distributed U (−1, 1) random variables. Let M = 4 be the number of demand shifters for
each good. Define zi = (zi1 , . . . , ziM )0 ∈ RM and
1
1
δ = ( , . . . , )0 ∈ RM and ηi ∼ U (6, 7).
4
4
The values of the demand shifters, zij , are selected to yield market prices with ”competitive”
markups over marginal costs.
P
For the railroads’ cost function, let C(q1 , q2 , . . . , qN ) = N
i=1 [wi γ + i ]qi , where wi is a
K-dimensional vector cost shifters. Draw the wij as independent and identically distributed
U (−1, 1) random variables. Let K = 5 be the number of cost shifters for each good. Define
wi = (wi1 , . . . , wiK )0 ∈ RK and let i ∼ U (4, 5). Set
1

γ = ( , . . . , )0 ∈ RK .

Variations in marginal cost are driven by variation in the wij . This variation in the values
of wij is chosen so that there high price competitive outcomes because of high values of
marginal cost.
Assuming the railroads set each shipment price, pi , to maximize the sum of profits over
the N shipments:
π(p1 , p2 , . . . , pN ) =

N

Di (pi )pi − C(D1 (p1 ), D2 (p2 ), . . . , DN (pN )),

−(zi δ + ηi )
−(zi δ + ηi ) + 1

!
wi0 γ + i )

(1)

Equation (1) demonstrates that variations in the markups over marginal cost are driven by
variation in the values of the zij and variations in marginal cost are driven by variation in
the wij . The combination of these two observable sources of random variation along with the
two unobservable sources of random variation in ηi and i produces a conditional distribution
of shipment prices given the zij and wij .
Translating the variables of this economic model into our notation for the conditional
distribution of the competitive price let, Xi = (zi , wi ), equal the set of conditioning variables
and yi = pi . We then use these N observations of yi and Xi to estimate the conditional
distribution of competitive prices given the shipment characteristics, F̂ (p|X), following the
procedure described in Section III.
Figure 1 presents the estimated values of fˆ(p|X) and F̂ (p|X) for N = 1, 000 observations,
for a fixed value of X. Although there is significant variation in prices, pi , the variation in
the markup of price over the marginal cost caused by variation in the values of zij is within
the range of what we consider to be the result of effective competition. The majority of the
variation in prices is due to variation in marginal costs caused by variation in the observed
cost shifters, wij , and variation in the unobserved values of ηi and i . For this reason, we
assume that all of the prices that arise from solving equation (1) are the result of ”effective”
competition and are therefore truly ”competitive.”

Our choice of the benchmark price is equivalent to selecting the value of the percentile of
the conditional distribution of competitive prices given shipment characterics beyond which
any observed price would be deemed ”excessive.” Suppose p∗ is the price of a potentially ”excessive” priced shipment with characteristics X ∗ . If 1 − α, for 1 > α > 0, is the percentile of
14

the distribution of F̂ (p|X) beyond which prices are deemed to be excessive, then P B(α, X ∗ )
solves the equation 1 − α = F (P B(α, X ∗ ). If p∗ > P B(α, X ∗ ), then the null hypothesis that
the observed shipment price, p∗ is ”competitive” would be rejected. An equivalent decision
rule is F̂ (p∗ |X ∗ ) > 1 − α this null hypothesis would be rejected.
The Monte Carlo samples of truly ”competitive” and truly ”excessive” prices used to
determine the ”optimal” value of α are constructed as follows. We repeat the process of
drawing observations of (zi , wi , ηi , i ) for i = 1, 2, . . . , M, and compute pi using equation (1)
for all i. Then, for every k values of the pi , we compute an ”excessive price,’ p̃i and replace
pi with p̃i . The processes used to compute these ”excessive prices” are described below.
For each i = 1, 2, . . . , M in this test sample, define
Ii = 1 if observation of pi = p̃i
= 0 otherwise.
This indicator variable is equal to 1 if the ith price observation is truly competitive and 0 if
this observation is truly non-competitive.
For each (pi , zi , wi ) combination in the test sample, we compute F̂ (pi |zi , wi ) using the
competitive price distribution estimated from the N = 1, 000 competitive price draws. We
then find the value of α which minimizes the sum of squared misclassification errors:
M
X

(Ii − Iˆi )2

(2)

i=1

where Iˆi is a simple rule where Iˆi = 1 if F̂ (pi , zi , wi ) > 1 − α, and 0 otherwise. Depending on
the value α, the value of Iˆi indicates whether the ith price exceeds the value of P B(α, X), the
benchmark price for a shipment with characteristics X and that value of α. Ideally, we would
like Iˆi = Ii when Ii = 1 and Ii = 0, meaning that when the price is truly ”competitive” it
does not exceed the benchmark price and when it is truly ”non-competitive” it does exceed
the benchmark price. This would make our objective function equal zero for all observations.
Note that both types of misclassification errors, Iˆi = 0 when Ii = 1 and Iˆi = 1 when Ii = 0,
contribute the same value, 1, to the objective function.
Solving for the value of α that minimizes (2) is the equivalent of finding the competitive
benchmark price function, P B(α, X), that minimizes the sum of squared misclassification
errors for observations (yi , Xi0 )0 in our test sample of ”competitive” and ”uncompetitive”
prices.
To compute ”excessive” prices in our test sample, we change the distribution of ηi . We

15

let
p̃i =

−(zi δ + η̃i )
−(zi δ + η̃i ) + 1

!
wi0 γ + i )

where η̃ ∼ U (m, n). We keep ηi ∼ U (6, 7) for competitive observations for all scenarios. We
alter the distribution of η̃i starting with a distribution of η̃i with a support that has the same
range but is significantly lower than the support of η. The support of η̃i has the same range
but closer to the support of ηi across the scenarios we consider. The closer the support of
η̃i is to the support of ηi , the more likely it is that our procedure will mistakenly classify
”competitive” prices as ”excessive” and ”excessive” prices as ”competitive.”
For all of the scenarios, we set M = 3, 000 and k = 5. Second column of Table 1 presents
the value of α that minimizes the sum of squared misclassfication errors for each distribution
of η̃i listed in the first column of the table. The third column of the table lists the number of
the number of Type I errors (competitive prices classified as ”excessive price” observations)
and the fourth column the number of Type II errors (”excessive price” observations classified
as competitive) for each distribution of η̃i . The final column gives the percentage of the 3,000
test sample observations that are misclassified (the sum of Type I and II errors) for each
distribution of η̃i .
We find that as the support of the distribution of η̃i comes closer to the support of
the distribution ηi , the distribution of ”excessive” prices is closer to the distribution of
”competitive” prices. The percent of observations in our test sample that are misclassified
rises. However, even for the case that the supports of η̃i and ηi are virtually the same,
(5.75, 6.75) versus (6, 7), less than 20 percent of the observations in the test sample are
misclassified. Finally, for all of the scenarios considered the value of α that minimizes the
sum of squared misclassification errors lies in the interval (0.0627,0.0133).
These results demonstrate that if the support of the distribution of competitive prices
and the support of the distribution ”excessive prices” are closer to together, the smaller is
the value of the α that minimizes the sum of the squared misclassification errors. These
Monte Carlo results suggest that in practice the value of α is unlikely to be larger than 0.06
and smaller than 0.01.
Figures 2 to 7 contains graphs of the values of fˆ(p|X) and F̂ (p|X) for all prices in our test
samples for each of the six scenarios for the support of η̃i we consider. The red dots are the
truly non-competitive observations and the blue dots are the truly competitive observations.
These graphs and Table 1 illustrate that the major cost in terms of misclassification errors
as the supports of the distributions of competitive and non-competitive prices come closer
is a substantial increase in Type II errors–failing to find that a non-competitive price is
”excessive.” For all of the scenarios considered, the frequency of Type I errors–concluding
16

that a competitive price is ”excessive” remains very low.

IV. Determining a ”Reasonable Price” for a Shipment
Using the above results, we now implement our competitive benchmark pricing procedure
using actual data from the CWS in order to determine the appropriate ”reasonable price” to
use if an actual price is found to be ”excessive.” To this end, we estimate separate conditional
distributions for four broad commodity groups: petroleum products, farm products, coal,
and chemical products. We then apply our competitive benchmark price approach to all
potential ”non-competitively” determined prices for several values of α less than or equal
to 0.05. We then consider the total revenue implications of reseting any excessive prices to
various ”reasonable” price levels.
These competitive price conditional distributions could be estimated for more commodities and for narrower product groups (e.g., grain, hazardous materials) as long as there are
sufficient observations to obtain credible estimates. Once this conditional distribution has
been estimated for each commodity, the STB could use it to determine whether a shipper is
being charged an ”excessive price” for a movement or set of movements following the procedure described above given the shipment characteristics and a value of α. As we discuss
below, the value of α could be different for different commodities depending on the location
of the support of the distribution competitive prices versus the locational of the support of
the distribution of ”excessive” prices.
Estimating our conditional competitive price distribution relies primarily on data from
the CWS. The dependent variable yi is the natural logarithm of the average revenue per
ton mile (ARTM) for the shipment deflated by the gross domestic product price deflator.
This variable is the revenue received from a shipment divided by the product of the number

20

of tons in the shipment and the distance traveled. Revenues are the sum of freight revenues (transportation-related revenues), miscellaneous charges, and fuel surcharges.25 In the
calculation for ton-miles, the variable “billed weight” was used for tons, and distance was
calculated as the “total miles traveled for the shipment.”
The elements of Xi , the vector of shipment characteristics are: (1) shipment distance
(X1 ), (2) shipment size (number of cars) (X2 ), (3) the number of railroads involved in the
movement (X3 ), (4) the number of Class I railroads within 10 miles of the origin (X4 ), (5) the
number of Class I railroads with 10 miles of the destination (X5 ), (6) a dummy to indicate
whether the shipper owns the cars (X6 ), and (7) a dummy to indicate that there is no water
port within 50 miles of the origin (X7 ), and (8) a dummy to indicate that there is no water
port within 50 miles of the destination (X8 ). Additional variables can be added to the
vector of shipment characteristics, X. The elements of X selected for this implementation
were based on two factors: (a) previous empirical research on the determinants of shipment
rates and (b) the availability of the variables in the CWS and other publicly available data
sets.26 All of the continuous variables—distance, size, number of railroads—are measured in
natural logarithms, to make their marginal distributions more symmetric. We experimented
with different distances for constructing X4 , X5 , X7 , and X8 . Finally, fixed effects are
included for the year of the movement, for the primary railroad in the movement, and for
the five-digit Standard Transportation Commodity Code (STCC) categories. Each shipment
in the CWS has an expansion factor, EFi , that gives the STB’s estimate of the number of
shipments in the population of annual shipments with same observable characteristics as this
shipment.
These conditioning variables are chosen based on availability in the CWS and past econometric studies that examine how rail rates relate to shipment characteristics such as distance,
shipment size, and number of railroads involved in the shipment, as well as various measures
of intramodal and intermodal competition (Boyer 1987; Barnekov and Kleit 1990; McFarland
1989; Burton 1993; Wilson 1994; Dennis 2000; Schmidt 2001; MacDonald 1987; MacDonald
1989; Grimm et al. 1992; Burton and Wilson 2006).27
To implement our nonparametric conditional distribution estimator, we first divide the
vector X into two groups of variables: continuous (Xc ) and binary (Xd ) (this also include
25

Fuel surcharges were introduced by railroads in 2003 but were reported in different CWS fields by different
railroads. Some railroads included these surcharges in the freight revenue field and others included them
in the miscellaneous revenue field. From 2009 forward, CWS has had a separate field for fuel surcharges.
Therefore, our solution is to use total revenues, including these fuel surcharges, for the shipment as our
shipment revenue variable.
26
See, for example, MacDonald (1987 and 1989) and Wilson (1994).
27
Shipment size is measured by carloads in the shipment. It is common practice for railroads to offer
lower rates for multiple-car shipments.

categorical variables used for fixed effects). Using the dataset of observations classified as
being competitive routes, we regress y and the columns of Xc on Xd and take the residuals,
ep and eX . The each variable in eX is then scaled by subtracting its mean and dividing by
its standard deviation.
We then estimate the distribution F̂ (ep |eX ) using the process described above. Then,
using the estimated coefficients from the regressions on the sample of competitive shipments,
we compute ep and eX for the potentially non-competitive routes and then scale the variables
in eX using the mean and standard deviation from the competitive sample. We compute
F̂ (ep |eX ) for these observations, and classify observations as non-competitive using α, as
described above.
Results for estimating this conditional competitive price distribution model using petroleum
products, farm products, coal, and chemical products data from the years 2000 to 2013 from
the CWS are presented below.
Petroleum Products
There are 50,340 observations in the competitive dataset, and 36,073 in the potentially
non-competitive dataset. The following figures display the estimated distributions fˆ(ep |eX )
and F̂ (ep |eX ), for a fixed value of X.

sum of expansion factors for shipments that exceed the price benchmark in that year,28 The
final column is the ratio of the third column divided by the second column expressed as a
percentage. The first line of each table gives the totals for each column for all of the years
in the table. Across all years and for both α = .05 and α = .01 the frequency of excessive
observations is less than or equal to 5 percent.

In Table 4, we assess the impact of resetting shipment prices that are deemed to be
excessive to different features of the conditional competitive price distribution on the revenues
shippers earn from moving petroleum products over our sample period of 2000 to 2013.
We consider three possible ”reasonable” prices for shipments that have been deemed to be
excessive using our benchmark price for given value of α. First, we re-set ”excessive” prices
to the conditional mean of the competitive price distribution. Second, we set it equal to
the conditional median of the competitive price distribution. Last, we could set it equal
to P B(α, X) the competitive benchmark price for that shipment. We show the percent in
change total revenues over our sample period associated with replacing each ”excessive” price
with that ”reasonable” price using the benchmark price P (α, X) for α = .1, .05, .01.
Particularly, for the ”reasonable” price set equal to our competitive benchmark price,

The expansion factor for a shipment gives the estimated number of waybills in the population of shipments that the each waybill in the CWS sample represents.

the aggregate revenue implications for railroads of resetting the actual price to this price are
less than 1.2 percent for α less than or equal to .05. Even for ”reasonable” prices equal to
the conditional mean and median, the revenue reductions are less than 3.1 percent for α less
than or equal to .05.
To assess the extent to which shippers obtain rate relief by resetting the actual price to
one of these three ”reasonable” prices, we compute the average difference between the actual
”excessive” price and the ”reasonable” price for each of our measures of a ”reasonable” price.
Table 5 reports the average value of these price differences for the three ”reasonable” price
measures for values of α = .1, .05, .01. The last line of the table reports that average value of
actual prices for all of the prices in the test sample deemed to be ”excessive” for that value
of α.
These results demonstrate that even for the case of the ”reasonable” price equal to our
competitive benchmark, the average price change from the actual price to the ”reasonable”
price are a significant fraction of the average price that is deemed to be ”excessive.” For
example, for the case of α = .05, the average ”excessive” price is $ 18.38 and the average difference between the actual price and the ”reasonable” price using our competitive
benchmark price is $ 5.25, which implies an average price reduction of more than 28 percent.

Farms Products
For Farm Products there are 53,205 observations in the competitive dataset, and 115,337
in the potentially non-competitive dataset. Tables 6 and 7 reproduce tables 2 and 3 for farm
products. Across all years and for both α = .05 and α = .01 the frequency of excessive
observations is less than or equal to 2.7 percent.
In Table 8, we show the percent change in total revenue for our sample period if we were to
change prices that were classified as non-competitive to the three features of the conditional
distribution of competitive prices described above. In this case, resetting ”excessive” prices
to any of our three ’reasonable” prices implies a less than 1.3 percent revenue reduction for
α less than or equal to .05.
Table 9 reports the average value of these price differences for the three ”reasonable” price
measures for values of α = .1, .05, .01. These results demonstrate that even for the case of the
”reasonable” price equal to our competitive benchmark price, the average price changes from
the actual price to the ”reasonable” price are a significant fraction of the average price that
is deemed to be ”excessive.” For example, for the case of α = .05, the average ”excessive”
price is $ 1.58 and the average difference between the actual price and the ”reasonable” price
using our competitive benchmark price is $ 0.53, which implies an average price reduction
of more than 34 percent.

Coal
For coal, there are 285,976 observations in the competitive dataset, and 158,068 in the
potentially non-competitive dataset. Tables 10 and 11 break the classifications down by the
year of the observation and use the CWS expansion factors to estimate population values
for the number of ”excessive” prices and frequency of ”excessive” prices each year. For both
α = .05 the annual frequency of excessive observations is as high as 26 percent in 2006. With
and α = .01 the annual frequency of excessive observations never exceeds 9 percent.
Based on the results of the Monte Carlo study, coal is likely to be case of a product where
there is significant overlap between the support of the distribution of competitive prices and
the support of the distribution of non-competitive prices, which argues in favor of a value of
α in the neighborhood of .01.
In Table 12, we show the percent change in revenue if we were to change prices that
were classified as non-competitive for the three features of the conditional distribution of
competitive prices. In this case, resetting ”excessive” prices to any of our three ’reasonable”
prices for the case of α = .05 implies at least a 3.5 percent reduction in annual revenues.
For the case of α = .01, the largest percentage reduction in annual revenues is 3.4 percent,
which provides a further evidence that α = .01 is likely to be the appropriate choice of α for
the coal.
Table 13 reports the average value of these price differences for the three ”reasonable”
price measures for values of α = .1, .05, .01. These results provide additional evidence that
there is significant overlap between the supports of the distributions of ”excessive” prices and
competitive prices. The average price changes from the actual price to a ”reasonable” price
27

set equal to our competitive benchmark price is 5 cents for α = .05. The average ”excessive”
price for this scenario is 25 cents, which implies an average price reduction of 20 percent,
which is a significantly lower percentage change than is the case for petroleum products or
farm products.

Chemical Products
For Chemical Products there are 356,187 observations in the competitive dataset, and
197,624 in the potentially non-competitive dataset. Tables 14 and 15 break the classifications
down by the year of the observation and use the CWS expansion factors to estimate population values of the number and the percent of excessive prices each year. For both α = .05
the frequency of excessive observations is never higher than 6.8 percent, and is typically in
the range of 3 to 4 percent. With α = .01 the frequency of excessive observations never
exceeds 1.2 percent.
Based on the results of the Monte Carlo study, chemical products is likely to be case of
a product where there is less overlap between the support of the distribution of competitive
prices and the support of the distribution of non-competitive prices than is the case for coal.
This argues in favor of a value of α in the neighborhood of .05.
In Table 16, we show the percent change in revenue if we were to change prices that
were classified as non-competitive for the three features of the conditional distribution of
competitive prices. Resetting ”excessive” prices to any of our three ’reasonable” prices for
the case of α = .05 implies at least a 3.2 percent reduction in annual revenues. For the case of
α = .01, the largest percentage reduction in annual revenues is less than one percent, which
provides a further evidence that α = .05 may be the appropriate choice for the chemicals.
Table 17 reports the average value of these price differences for the three ”reasonable”
price measures for values of α = .1, .05, .01. These results provide additional evidence that
there is less overlap between the supports of the distributions of ”excessive” prices and
competitive prices for chemicals than for coal. The average price changes from the actual
price to a ”reasonable” price set equal to our competitive benchmark price is $3.31 for
α = .05. The average ”excessive” price for this value of α is $11.75, which implies an
average price reduction of 30 percent, which is in the neighborhood of the values obtained
for petroleum products and farm products.
In Table 16, we show the percent change in revenue if we were to change prices that
were classified as non-competitive using the three features of conditional competitive price
distribution.

A number of conclusions emerge from our Monte Carlo study and the application of our
competitive benchmark price to data from the CWS. First, our Monte Carlo study finds that
values of α less than 0.06 and greater than 0.01 appear to minimize the expected value of
the square of misclassification errors for the types of conditional distributions of competitive
prices and conditional distributions of ”excessive” prices likely to be encountered in practice.
Second, for these values of α, the vast majority of shipment prices in our test sample are
correctly classified as competitive when they are truly competitive.29 Third, for these values
of α, even resetting the ”excessive” price to the conditional mean or conditional median of
the competitive price distribution is likely to have a relatively small adverse impact on the
revenues earned by shippers for the four products considered. Fourth, resetting the value of
an ”excessive” price to the value of our competitive benchmark price has the smallest adverse
impact on railroad revenues. Fourth, for all products we find that resetting ”excessive” prices
to any of our ”reasonable” price produces economically meaningful price reductions for the
effected shippers. For α less than .05, the smallest average percentage price reduction for
mitigated shipments relative to the average actual ”excessive” price is 20 percent.
Taken together, these results suggest that our benchmark pricing approach can be a low
administrative cost approach for the STB to carry out its statutory mandate to protect
shippers from excessive prices, while at the same time not adversely impacting the ability
of the railroads to achieve the aggregate revenues necessary for their long-term financial
viability.
29

When the supports of the distribution of non-competitive prices and competitive prices overlap, most of
the misclassification errors are due to classifying non-competitive prices as competitive prices.

32

V. Potential Use Benchmark Price Mechanism in Regulatory Process
There are a variety of ways to use the benchmark price mechanism to carry out the STB’s
mandate to protect captive shippers from ”excessive” prices. The competitive benchmark
price approach could replace the R/VC ¡ 180 test for an ”excessive” price as the first step
in the rate relief process. Alternatively, the benchmark price could supplement the R/VC ¡
180 test to ensure that failure of this test is in fact due to a non-competitive price, rather
than the methodological issues with the UCRS ”variable cost” (VC) measure discussed in
Wilson and Wolak (2016).
Using the benchmark price approach to replace the R/VC ¡ 180 test for an ”excessive”
price would end the STB’s reliance on URCS ”variable cost” measures in making an ”excessive” price finding. This would likely require legislation to change this step in the ”excessive”
price determination process. The need for legislative action raises the question who should
set the value of α that determines the value of the benchmark price. Similar to the case of
the R/VC ¡ 180 percent test, the value of α could be set in the legislation that implements
the benchmark price. Alternatively, the law could provide legislative guidance to the STB
in setting the value α. For example, the law could direct the STB to set α to minimize the
sum of squared misclassification errors.
As is the case under the current rate relief process, a price that exceeds the benchmark
level would not be subject to regulatory relief unless the STB also determines the rate charged
is the result of a market dominance. The benchmark price mechanism can also provide useful
input to this stage of the rate relief process. A railroad that sets a price that exceeds the
benchmark level for its product and shipment characteristics could be required to identify
the factors not included in X, the vector of observed product and shipment characteristics,
that ”explains” this high price. Conversely, the shipper can argue that these factors do not
”explain” the high price charged.
This use of the benchmark price approach supports one of the recommendations for
reform of the rate relief process from the NAS report, Modernizing Freight Rail Regulation,
to use final offer arbitration to determine the ”reasonable” shipment price if the railroad is
found to charge a price that exceeds the benchmark price and that price is found to be the
result of a dominant railroad. The arbitrator could determine whether the factors proposed
by the railroad ”explain” the higher price and therefore the shipper is not entitled to rate
relief.
This arbitration process could provide input to the computation of future benchmark
prices. If a certain factor not included in the vector of observed characteristics, X, used to
compute the benchmark price is found by the arbitrator to ”explain” the higher price, the
STB could require data on that factor to be compiled for all future shipments in the Waybill
33

data. This factor could then be incorporated in the vector of observed characteristics, X.
For example, railroads argue that hazardous materials are more expensive to move and
therefore charge higher prices to ship these materials. Based on the result of arbitration
processes on this issue, the STB could require shippers to report shipment characteristics in
their Waybill data that describe the dimensions of the hazardous materials in the shipment
and these observable factors could be incorporated into the vector of product and shipment
characteristics, X, used to compute the conditional distribution of competitive prices.
Even if no legislative change is made in the rate relief process, the benchmark price
mechanism could be used in this process. It could provide as an additional check on whether
a rate that violates the R/VC ¡ 180 percent test is in fact ”excessive.” It could also help
focus the rate relief process on identifying the unobserved factor or factors that ”explain”
the higher price charged by the railroad. Finally, it could provide useful input to the STB
in determining a ”reasonable” price for the shipment in the event that the STB finds that a
price is ”excessive.”
A final issue that the benchmark price approach can address is the impact of the selection
of ”reasonable” price on the annual revenue adequacy of the railroad. As shown in Section IV,
setting the ”reasonable” price using a percentile of the conditional distribution of competitive
prices allows an analysis of the annual revenue implications different choices of α determining
this reasonable price. Smaller values of α imply a larger value for the ”reasonable” price and
therefore a smaller reduction in annual revenues from resetting ”excessive” prices.
This logic suggests another factor to consider in setting the value of α: the year-to-year
volatility in rail revenues from movements in involving the product under consideration.
Figure 9 plots the annual operating revenues for the seven Class I railroads operating in
the United States from 2002 to 2017.30 The year-to-year variation revenues excluding the
financial crisis period of 2009 to 2009 provides guidance for selecting the value of α. Based
on these graphs, an annual revenue change of 5 percent is consistent with the year-to-year
variation from trend growth in revenues over time for all of the Class I railroads.
This logic implies that those product categories that typically experience less year-to-year
variation in revenues relative to trend should have lower values of α than those products that
experience more year-to-year variation in revenues. Among our four categories of products,
we would expect that coal typically experiences the least year-to-year variation in revenues,
given that historically coal was used to produce baseload electricity. Petroleum, farm products and chemicals are likely to have higher year-to-year variation in product-level revenues

than coal. This logic implies that coal would have a smaller value of α than the other three
products.

VI. Concluding Comments
The fact that a growing share of rail shipments are moving at rates that are determined
under competitive conditions presents an opportunity to use this data to construct a conditional distribution of competitive prices given shipment characteristics that can be used to
determine whether rate charged for shipment is ”excessive.” The computation of this benchmark price can be automatically updated each year given a sample of shipment prices and
observable characteristics along with their expansion factors from the annual Carload Waybill Sample. Moreover, this conditional distribution of competitive prices can be updated to
condition additional observable characteristics that are found to ”explain” shipment prices.
This benchmark pricing approach can be used formally and informally in the rate relief
process. Formal use would likely require a legislative change, but informal use could used to
assess whether violation of the current standard for an ”excessive” price is the result noncompetitive conditions or the result of methodological issues with the existing approach to
rate relief described in Wilson and Wolak (2016). The conditional distribution of competitive
35

prices can also provide input to the process of determining a ”reasonable” price, if the existing
regulatory process finds that a price is ”excessive” and the result of dominance.

Appendix A
This appendix describes our choice of the kernel function used to compute our estimate
of F̂ (y|X) and the procedure we use to estimate the vector of smoothing parameters a.
For K(·) we use the Epanechnikov kernel,

K(x) = (1 − x2 ) for |x| < 1

and
Ka (X − Xi ) =

K
a

j
j=1

where a = (a1 , a2 , . . . , aJ ), and X j is the j th variable of X. Other choices of the kernel
function K(t) produced similar estimates of F (t|X). Once the vector a is selected, our
estimate of the F (y|X) can be computed given a random sample of (yi , Xi0 )0 and associated
expansion factors EFi i = 1, 2, ..., N . We choose values of a according to the bootstrap
bandwidth selection approach analyzed by Bashtannyk and Hyndman (2001) and originally
recommended by Hall et al. (1999).31 .
Our procedure for estimating the bandwidth parameter vector a for our kernel regression
estimator of F (y|X) first fits a rich polynomial regression
yi = β0 +

J
X

βj1 Xji + · · · + βjk Xjik + σi

j=1

where i are regression errors that are assumed to be independent and identically distributed
N (0, σ 2 ) random variables and k is determined by Akaike’s (1973) Information Criterion.
The β’s and σ are estimated from the data. We then form a parametric estimator F̃ (y|X)
from this model based on the assumption that the i are independent and identical normally
distributed random variables. Then we simulate l = 1, 2, ..., L bootstrap data sets y (l) =
(l)
(l)
{y1 , . . . , yn } based on the observations X = {X1 , . . . , Xn } from this parametric model.
We then choose the vector a to minimize
31

We also employed the cross-validation method set forth in Li and Racine (2008) to compute the bandwidth parameters. However, this method took an order of magnitude longer to run, due to the size of our
data, without the resulting parameters being very far from the ones estimated using the method of Hall et

37

F̂ (·|X, a) is our non-parametric estimate of the conditional distribution of y given X and
F̃ (yj0 |Xi )] the parametric estimate of this condition distribution.
Given a∗ , the optimized value of a, we can compute F̂ (y|X, a∗ ) for any values of y and
X. The process of computing the ”optimal” value of a described above can be automated,
given a sample of (yi , Xi0 )0 for i = 1, 2, ..., N as each step of the process has well-defined
termination rule.
