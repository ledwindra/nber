RETIREMENT RESEARCH USING THE
HEALTH AND RETIREMENT SURVEY

ABSTRACT
This paper highlights unanswered research questions in the economics of retirement, and

shows how these issues can be addressed using the new Health and Retirement Survey (HRS).

Unique features of the survey axe described including administrative records on earnings and

social security benefits, And employer provided data on pensions and health insurance. Also
collected are indicators of retirement plans, health status, family structure, income, wealth and

employer policies affecting job opportunities and constraints. Data from the first wave of the
HRS are used to analyze retirement outcomes and constraints shaping retirement behavior.

Retirement Research Using the Health and Retirement Survey
Researchers and policy makers have become increasingly aware of the critical need for a new

longitudinal survey to anaJyze work, retirement, and health patterns of older Americans. One reason Is that
existing data sets are out of date, and hence less useful for current policy purposes. The economic, health, and

social opportunities fxing older people art different now titan in past decades. In addition, people rezhlng
ittirement age today may have different expectations about health and retirement than In prevIous years.'
VThile both the Retirement History Study (RHS) and the National Longitudinal Survey of Older Men

(NLS-OM) were invaluable for analysis of prior generations, they focused on people who are now In their late

70's and 80's. This cohort is now well past the period when most people are making tethernent decisions.2
The Health and Retirement Survey (HItS) is a new longitudinal survey designed to fill this gap. It
includes a comprehensive set of questions which will pennit modern econometric studies of labor torte and
health outcomes and their determinants. Wave I of the HItS focuses on a representative sample of older

people age 51-61 in 1992 as well as their spouses. These people will be followed with a longiwdirial survey

format for years to come, with the second wave fielded In 1994.
The HItS collects a rich array of information on income and time constraints affecting this cohorts
retirement expectations. attitudes and opportunities. The study includes Information on earnings profiles,
current and anticipated privately-provided beneflts such as pensions and health Insurance, current and

anticipated government payments such as social security, disability and other benefits, and a variety of other
data on income, debt, and assets- Finally the survey coniains numerous measures deemed Important by

sociologists, psychologists, and the medical profession, Including employer and fellow-employee attitudes
toward older woricers, Ian Ely demands, and an assessment of workers' and spouses' psychological and physical
stales.

Our task in this essay is to identify how key researth and policy questions about retirement can be

addressed with the new HItS, After a brief overview of the most Important questions that the retirement

literature is confronting, we turn to an analysis of the new information available In Wave I of the HItS on
older Americans' labor market outcomes, along with data on the opportunities and constraints they fre,
including income and assets, health status, family structure, and uansfas. We conclude with a discussion of

1

what the findings portend for researchers examining retirement and health using the FIRS in the future.

I. How Can the FIRS Help Address the important Retirement Questions?
To plxe in context the anticipated contributions of the new Health and Retirement Survey. it Is useful
to review briefly some lessons flow the last two decades of retirement research. In general, most of those
who have examined retirement patterns from an economic perspective would agree with the following points:3

•

Older people decide when to retire by raking into account not only current work and leisure

opportunities. but future opporuurities as welL Hence retirement behavior must be modelled using an

intertemporal utility maximization framework rather than with a single-period model of cross sectIonal
labor force status.

•

Jobs and pensions sometimes make it costly to continue working or older ages. This can happen

when a defined benefit pension subsidizes early retirement, or when a national retirement income

system penalizes deferred retirement Additionally, there may be problems finding Jobs with reduced

hours of work, and some older workers fxe age discrimination flow employers. All of these frtors
generate nonlinearities in older workers' budget constraints near retirement

•

Retirement pairerns way according to family structure and marital status. 'the presence, or

absence, of spouses. dependent children, and elderly parents, has substantial effects on retirement

patterns for both men and women.

•

Retirement is influenced by health as well as economic factors.

Most retirement researchers would also agree that several Important unanswered questions need

answers, in order to better understand why people retire when they do, and what effect health and retirement

policy have on behavior. Six questions are worthy of special note here, though we Iecognl2e that the list
could be expanded considerably:
1.

What explains the long trend toward earlier retirement among men, and why did the downward trend

level out in the last decade?
Men's labor force participation rates fell In the U.S from the 1950's to the mld-l980's. and then

levelled off. There remains considerable controversy about what explains these patterns, and answers must be

refined for better retirement income policy.' The FIRS will be useful In providing better estimates of the

2

incentives created by pensions and Social Security on retirement, and by frilitatlng the analysis of how

changes in these incentives affect retirement outcomes.
2. How does the family context affect decisions about work and retirement?
Researchers

have only begun to understand how retirement decisions axe deteamined within the tinily.

Rising rates of market work riong women and changing tinily structures are likely to affect patterns of labor
market participation inong women and men at older ages. Economic secuflty has become morn elusive for
some older persons due to increasing divorce rates and longevity, exposing Increasing numbers of people to
greater risk of poverty and increased likelihood of need for long team care. Linked to this Is the question of
how well todays aging generation Is insured against possible drops in consumption though pensions, life and
disability insurance. The MRS offers unique opportunities to examine how faulty stauctwe affects wok and
decisions about retirement.
3. What are useful ways to measure and model the impact of health status on retirement?

A debate continues on how best to measure health status in the context of retirement studies. Existing
data sets cannot resolve this debate since they do not provide health measures of sufficiently high quality to
detennine whether self-reported health measures can be treated as exogenous detetmlnants of retirement
(Saxnmartlno, 1987). The MRS offers researchers better infonnatlon on respondents' health than any previous

retirement data set, with detailed reports on chronic and aute health conditions, medical care Insurance, and
medical care utilization. Moreover, the appended questions on provisions of retirement and disability
programs, together with these health measwes, allow MRS users to detennine how health status Interacts with
beneflt and health care plans to shape labor force participation and retirement behavior.

4. How do retirement patterns respond to pecuniary and nonwage attributes of Jobs?
Since wages ate the most important element In compensation, a great deal of attenUon must be

devoted to their accurate collection. Benefits Including pensions and retiree health Insurance also affect the
rewards for continued work among older individuals, as do nonwage Job attributes and Job relationships.

including implicit threats of dismIssal, company unwillingness to aiapt to employee disability, Job stress, or

fellow-worker pressure to leave. Information on these aspects of work Is collected in the HRS. Workers and
retirees axe asked what they could and do earn as of the survey dare as well as on their previous Job. These

3

data are supplemented with individual-specitlc earnings records supplied by the Social Security
Administration. Pension and health Insurance expectations are collected from the older person directly.

supplemented with outside inlonnation collected from the employer. Data on job demande, working
conditions, and other job aitaibutes are also Included In the HItS.

5. How do retirement decisions interact with savings and consumption, as well as wealth accumulation and
bequests?

A model which satisfactorily integrates both savings and retirement decisions has yet to be estimated

empirically! Retirement models which ignore savings may be mlsspecifled, and conversely savings models
which ignore retirement are incomplete. We need to know more about asset accumulation as workers
approach retirement, arid particularly about those who accumulate virtually no personal assets (Vend and
Wise, 1993). Perhaps people do not save because of high Ume preference or low after-tax interest rates, or
perhaps because pensions and Social Security most than meet their projected retirement needs, or they greatly

underestimate resolute needs in retirement. Additional explanations include uncertainty about future health,

combined with the availability of programs like Medicaid that insure losses only after assets art depleted.
trifonnation for exnining these alternate hypotheses is contained in the HRS.
6.

What factors determine peoples' expectations about their/ware opportunities and constraints in retirement,

and how accurate are these expectations?

Existing data sets do not permit a full exploration of how well older people understand what they will
receive from Social Security and pensions when they retire, how much savings they will have had to
accumulate to sustain their consumption in retirement, and the way that their pension and Social Security

benetit payments are affected by additional earnings.' The HRS offers a unique opportunity to compare
company-provided infoanation on actual health and pension plans provided to covered workers, with
respondents' expectations of pensions, insurance, and Social Security benefits. The HRS also asks question
about peoples' anticipated life expectancy, health outlook, spousal retirement expectations. reported planning

horizen, etc. Eventually Medicare and mortality Infonnallon will be matched with hiltS survey files, and
these too can be compared with corresponding Infomiation on the questionnaire. Each of these links enables
mesearthers more accurately to match peoples' stated expectations with realizations, and how in turn these

4

affect retirement outcomes.

It. Retirement in the Health and Retirement Survey
This section outlines theoretical and practical. aspects of the MRS which researchers shouid be aware

of when exanining retirement behavior with this survey. In addition we offer some initial evidence on the
extent of retirement behavior currently observed in Wave I, and some early evidence of patterns that will
emerge as subsequent waves are collected.

Conceptualizing Retirement
The tenu retirement' has many meanings and can be empirically represented using a variety of labor
market measures. These include worker withdrawal frum the labor force, or the point when he or she leaves a

career job or stops working full-time, or when the worker files [or pension (or Social Security) benefits.

among others.'
Because many different types of labor force transitions occur toward the end of the wortlife, the MRS
incorporates many detailed questions on labor market activIty and the opportunities facing older Individuals.
In Wave I. the baseline questionnaire collected In 1992, the MRS inquires about respondents current
employment status, pay and benefits, and working conditions Oncluding hours flexibility and employer
attiwdes). Those who have pensions and health insurance coverage on their curreot Jobs axe also asked the

rime of their employer. Pension and health plan descriptions offered by these Dims ate being collected (mm
the employer and the U.S. Department of Laboc For persons not employed at the lime of the survey,
questions axe asked about prior employment.

Much of this labor market information Is collected for all tespondenls In Wave 1. For example all are
queried regarding recent jobs that lasted for five years or mote, and on other jobs offering pension coverage.
Moreover, all respondents who signed a release will have theft social security earnings history attached to

their file, permitting the reconstruction of employment and earnings history in all covered employment (It will,
however, not be possible to separate hours and wages). In designing the survey, an effort was also marie to
obtain information on opportunities not taken. Specifically, respondents are asked about recent Job search and

unemployment: in addition brief infonnation was obtaIned on past layoffi. Wave 2, fielded In 1994, and
subsequent waves, can then be used to gauge the curacy of retirement expectations, and whether rethetnent

5

behavior is affected by poor information about work and pension opportunities. Lastly, the MRS asks about
peoples' reasons for retiring and/or changing jobs, infonnailon that has been unavailable In earlier studies.'

Work and Retirement in Wave I of the MRS
Table I shows that a relatively large fraction of MRS respondents are not working, even though the

target population is quite young in Wave I -- age 51 to 61 years old.9 The top six rows of the table define
retirement as zero or few hours per year of work. By this definition, slightly over one fifth of the men In the

san pIe axe retired, and about two fifths of the women, Focusing on men. Whites and Hispanics report equal

rates of nonemployment, about one-fifth, while a third of Black males report they are retired by this definition.

Among women, about 40% of both White and Black females report no current Job, while more than half of
Hispanic females are not working for pay.

Different definitions produce different tallies of employment and tetirernent status. Since the MRS

target population was 51 to 61 years old In 1992, the cohort is not yet eligible for soda! security retirement
benefits. Some people nevertheless report themselves as 'retired', though the figures are significantly lower

than the objective labor forte status measures discussed above. Row 1 of Tablet shows that only 15% of the
men and 28% of the women consider themselves retired." The sane relative relation by race appears for
men.

Evidence on partial retirement patterns also appears In Table 1. Among men. 4 to 6% are partially

retired using definitions based on hours of work per week, weeks pa year or hours pa year up to 1200
hours, with more being classified as partially retired when the 15(X) hour cutoff Is used. Partial retirement
rates are about double

anorig women, at 6 to 10%, wIth 15% workIng fewer that 1500 hours; the gap Is much

smaller when the employment measure is weeks per year. It Is possible that one should differentiate partial
retirees between those who always worked part-time, and those who previously held flail-time Jobs. Fifteen
percent of men and 8% of women report having left a long term Job after age 45, where by 'long terra" Is
meant

a job held for 10-i- years. If insteal the cutoff Is having left aJob of 20÷ years after age 45. the

corresponding figures are 8% and 2% of men and women ate partially retired. Using self.reports. 8% of men

and 5% of women describe themselves as partially reused. White men are more likely to be measured as, and
to report themselves as, partially retired as compared to Black or Hispanic males, while Black women ate

6

more likely to be partially retired than ax White females; Hispanic women report a low probability of partlaJ
retirement.

A final set of measures in Table I describe MRS respondents' expectations with regard to work at
futwe ages. Men anticipate that the odds of working at age 62 slightly exceed one half, while women report
about a 40% probability of working. Forecasting to age 65, men report only a 30% chance of working, and

women less than a 25% chance.
Figure I summarizes graphicafly the patterns for full and partial retirement measures by age In the
MRS baseline survey. Defining full retirement as having no current job, the fraction retired Increases with

age, but the graph Is not a smooth cwve. Among 61-year old MRS respondents, one-third of the men and

almost half the women have no current job; these are higher than the rates at age 51, where 12% of the men
and 36%

of the women do not hold a job. For men the sharpest change in retirement levels occurs between

ages 58 and 59, with other large increases at 54-55 and 6041. For women the largest Increases are at 52-53.
60-61. and 55-56. To what extent these changes are due to provisions of retirement programs awaits further

investigation. Partial retirement in Figure us defined as working less than 1200 hours per year; this rises by
about five percentage points for men between ages SI and 61, and less than one percentage point for women.
Other retirement definitions will also be used by researchers studying the MRS. but most of these
require additional Information to evaluate changes over lime in work patlans. It Is also worth noting that

retirement may not be an absorbing stale, so that people may flow back and forth between work and
retirement." To pennit study of this behavior at baseline and thereafter, MRS respondents are asked

retrospective questions about their last job to determine labor forte transitions near the end of the wo&life.'2
In addition, other information Is to be gathered from the Social Security Admlnlslration and from the

employer.
HI. Elements or the OpportunIty Set In the HRS
In designing the MRS. it was deemed essential to map carefully the constraints and opportunities older
people face, including money arid time constraints. This section describes findings from Wave I of the MRS
about each of these factors."

Labor Market Earnings and Job OpportunItIes
7

In developing retirement models, analysts must predict a range of wage offers for all HRS
respondents. correcting observed pay measures for selectivity bias and estimating potentIal wages for work on

a full-time main job. on a post-retiieinent but full-time job, and/or on a part-time Job." Here we report only
evidence on job earnings and opportunities for those employed in 1992.
Several different pay measures appear in Table 2. One approach classifies MRS respondents in Wave

I as MI-time workers if their usual annual hows total 1200 or more. The first three lines of Table 2 show that
full-time workers earn higher median pay than do part-time workers, but the differences between the rates
depend on the time period over which earnings are measured. On an howly basis, men employed full time

have hourly wages 45% higher than their partime counterparts ($14 versus almost $10 per hour); however on
an annual basis male MI-time workers earn more than three limes as much ($32,000 versus $10,000 per year).

An even more pmnounced differential applied to women: full-Umers earn 32% more on an hourly basis, and
more than three times as much on an annual bat We also note that pay rates for part-time self-employed
men are relatively high in Wave 1 of the MRS."

Table 3 also shows that many workers In the HRS age range face hours constraints.t' Among

full-time male workers, 12% report they would like to work fewer hours than permitted to on their current
jobs. Almost 15% would like to Increase their hours of work. Increasing hours Is a goal of 15% of the

full-time working women, while slightly fewer than 15% wish to reduce work hours. Past-time employees

appear much less constrained in tens of wishing to provide fewer hours (5% of the men. 3% of the women).
but many mote would like to Increase their hours

of work (18% of the men and 21% of the women).

Table 3 shows that a reasonably large segment of the MRS Mi-time workforce Is continuing to work
after having been laid off Ixomajob held for more than 10 years. About 8% of full-time men and 6% of

full-time women are still working after having been laid off from a long-time Job, most of them working for a

new employer rather than being self-employed.

Social Security Benefits and Taxes

The MRS cohort Is still too young to be eligible for socJal security based on Its own earnings, and
most san pie members aie not now eligible for payments based on spouse status. In future survey waves.

social security benefits will be the focus of much attention Inasmuch as they constitute the mor sowve of

S

income for large segments of the older population. It Is anticipated that social security benefits will be

computed three different ways and the results compared. A first approach will use questions In Wave I,
where respondents are asked what they expect to receive In social security payments at the point they reUse.
Second. when earnings histories are attached to the flies of respondents who have granted permission to the
research organization to obtain data, benefit computation algorithms can be used to predict respondentS

benefits at various ñiwre retirement dates. Analogous calculations will also Indicate the retirement Incentives
citaled by social security regulations including the earnings test, benefit recomputallon rules, and the delayed

retirement credit (which may differ across sample members depending on year of birth). Future survey waves
will also report benefits actually received by retirees.
Available infonnation regarding social security In Wave I pertains mainiy to expected coverage and

benefits. As seen In Table 4, fewer than 1% currently receive social security benefits from disability or other
programs. The table includes only currently employed workers, but almost all of the employed workers (92%)
expect to receive social security benefits. Benefit expectancy does not vary much by marital status, though
there is a gap across ethnic groups: Whites axe 6% more likely and Blacks are about 3% more likely than
Hispanics to anticipate receiving benefits. Other differences observed are less notable by finn size, union
status, and pension status, though manufacturing employees are 6 percentage points more likely to expect

benefits.

A related question is what happens when people misunderstand the social security benefit structure.

This is a concern prompted by prior surveys which concluded that older people tend to stop waking when
their pay rises to the point that their social security benefits sin subject to an earnings test; the anomaly Is that

other features of the benefit formula offset the earnings test, making It worthwhile for most people to continue

in the labor market." If future MRS waves reveal a similar spike in the flequency distribution of earnings at
the Income disregard for the earnings test. This will suggest that analysts should rethink older peoples'
understanding of the benefit computation process. A related Issue is how to model workers' evaluations of the
uncertainty surrounding future social security benefits and taxes. These future streams should have attached to
them peoples' valuations of their riskiness, and the HRS can help make headway In measuring how these

streams may vary In the future.

9

The middle columns of Table 4 display the MRS respondents' expectations with regard to fistwt social

secwity benefit changes. Few believe that benefits are likely to rise on average, with odds of only 2.5 out of
ID. while people offer much higher odds that benefits will be cut, about 6 out of 10. Indeed MRS members
are as pessimistic about the prospects of a major depression and high inflation as they are about cuts in social

security benetits. While the means are fairly similar across most groups shown in Table 4. both Hispanics and
Blacks are more optimistic than others about their benefit prospects under Social Security.

Employer-Provided Pensions and Health Insurance
To date, nationally representative retirement surveys have not supplied high-quality data on

company-provided pensions and health insurance)' This Is an Important omission Inasmuch as benefits are
believed to influence retirement patterns profoundly, because they comprise a major portion of older worker's
wealth, and because the benefit rules impart large discontinulties to older workers' budget consualuts.

The HRS seeks to remedy this data deficit by linking employers' descriptions of their pension and
health care plans to each individuals survey record. Survey respondents were asked to Identify their
employers, and the Institute for Social Research (tSR) is collecting benefit plan reports from various sources

for subsequent conversion to computer-reariable format. Mdillonally, a computer software program Is being
written at the University of Michigan to compute participants' pension eligibility ages and expected benefits,

which will stren line the process of esurnating pension wealth. As of this writing the employer-side link is
not yet available, so the discussion here describes only what MRS respondents state they expect to receive,

rather than what their employers plan on providing after retirement
HRS respondents am asked in Wave I whether they are covered by a private pension arid If so what
type of plan they have. Employed respondents' responses appear In Table 5 (excludIng the self-employed).

Two-thirds report having pension coverage. Consistent with earlier surveys, the data show that women and
nonwhites ate less likely to have a pension than are men and whites. People most likely to have a pension ate
union members, employees of large firms, and rnanufactwlng employees)'
These flndings are confirmed with a descriptive multivariate probit analysis of pension coverage
whose results appear in Table 6. Reported values reflect the effect of a difference In the Indicated exrrlanatorv

variable on the probability of coverage for the set of employed Wave I respondents. The results are
10

consistent with earlier findings that pension coverage is more widespread for better educated and hIgher paid
workers as well as employees in large flims. manufacturing companies, and unionized Jobs. Not only are the
estimated coefficients statistically significant, but the observed differences In coverage are large and consistent
across women and men, after controlling on age and ethnic group. The results also show that pension

coverage is significantly lower for self-employed and part-time workers, with self-employed women having a
proportionally larger decrease in coverage, and part-time men relatively less likely to have coverage.
Policymakers are currently quite interested In the types

of pensions that workers have nong those

who have a plan. and the I-IRS offers information on this mailer. Approximately 42% of the MRS pension

covered snple reports having a defined benefit pension alone, while ant 25% IndIcates having a defined
benefit plan paired with another type of plan (Fable 5). Defined conthbutlon plans, particularly 4OlQc) plans,
have grown quickly over the last decade. This trend Is reflected In the MRS with more than one quarter of all
covered respondents having a 4OlQc) plan (either alone or in combination with other plans). Fewer than 3%

of covered workers cannot classify their plan type, a far smaller proportion than In previous surveys. In the
1983 Survey of Consumer Finances, for exnple. 19% of respondents could not Identify their plan type

(Mitchell 1988).
Retirement incentives In pensions depend on a number of plan characteristIcs Including the "nomial"

retirement age, or the age at which retirees me eligible to receive "fill" or unreduced benefit This age has
been declining and is now quite low, as is evident flom Table 7. HRS pension-covered workers report that
their pension plans allow retirement with unreduced benefits at a normal retirement age averagIng 61. or a

median age of 62. Most pension plans also pennit early retirement. though usually with reduced benefilsIn the HItS, workers with defined benefit pensions face a mean (and a median) early retirement age of

58, with a range from 57 to 60 for various subgroups. Respondents with defined benefit plans who know how
much their early retirement benefits are reduced report that their pension reduction factor Is about 5% per

year. A reduction factor of this magnitude usually implies that eziy retirees receive subsldl7td benefits?a
Other early-out IncenUves include so-called "window' plans. Table S shows that more than 5% of all MRS
respondents (not just the employed as In previous tables) report that they have ever been offered an early

retirement window. About half of those offered the plans have rcepte&'
11

Eventually the HRS will permit a comparison of these data with plan characteristics and pension
accnjal profiles computed horn employer-supplied descriptions of the pension. With the computer software It
is possible to calculate each coveted worker's expected "pension wealth profile," taking as Input the worker's
pension plan description and assumptions regarding expected future earnings, Inflation rates, anticipated Social

Secwity benefits, and longevity information. In rddltlon to providing a straight calculation of the expected

benefit at alternative retirement dates, the program can also be used top answer 'what If' questions (such
as how the pension might change lithe Social Security offset changed, or If the pension contribution or
benefit formula changed).12

Employer-provided health insurance benefits should also be Included anong the factors Influencing

worker mobility and retiiement behaviot While costs of employerprov1ded health Insurance are not available
in the HRS, there ate data on current coverage as well as health care benefits anticipated after retixemenL

Table 9 shows that health insurance coverage Is wldespreai In the HItS working cohort 86% have some
coverage and 80% of those enjoy coverage through their own employer. Company-supplied health coverage Is
higher for men and unmarried women, though many married women receive Insurance through their spouses.

This gender difference probably explains why coverage rates from own employment axe higher for Blacks and

Hispanics than for Wbites overall. In general, employees are more likely to be covered If they axe unionized
and have pensions (coverage rates axe 96% or higher), and work in large and manufacturing finns (92%).

Of those who have health insurance from their employa while actively employed, more than 69%
expect continued retiree health Insurance coverage, with rates even higher for union employees (80%) and

employees of large companies (74%). Only half of Hispanics and workers in small firms hope to receive
retiree healthcare coverage. Interestingly only 15% of those with current health coverage do not expect retiree
coverage, but a larger group, 16%. does not know what retiree coverage Is offered. Some may be entitled to
continued coverage through their spouse's continued employment, as Is evident In the Last column, of Table 9.

While a comparison of HItS with other databases Is beyond the scope of this study, It Is useful to ask
whether the HRS pension and health Insurance coverage data pear broally comis1st with c0ve

information from other surveys. Two data sets lend themselves to a natural comparlson the 1991 Survey of
Income and Pzogm Participation (51FF), and the 1988 Current Population Survey (CI'S). These two surveys
12

include people in broader age ranges and pose the coverage somewhat differently than In the MRS so.U'ie

figures would not be expected to be identical. Nevertheless, all three appear to tell a similar story.
Unpublished tabulations horn the SLIP indicate that 75% of men age 50-59 who are wage and salary workers
are covered by a pension, and 64% of women. Comparable figures for the slightly older MRS san pie axe

72% and 62%. CPS MI-time men and women employees age 50-59 repoti health coverage rates from their
own employment of 78% and 62% respectively in 1988, versus comparable MRS coverage rates of 80% and
5B% for men and women respectively.

Nonwage Aspects or The Job
The MRS asks respondents many questions about nonwage aspects of their jobs, Including physical

and mental job requirements, worker attitudes toward the job and Its constraints, and future prospects for
continued employment as well as alternative prospects. Answers to these questions should pemilt researchers
to derive variables useful to measuring Hits panicipantS preferences toward work and leisure. Where physical
demands of jobs are involved, it will also be natural to Interact these with Individuals' health status iii the
models explaining retirement.

Table 10 describes job attributes for HRS members working full-lime at the tUne of the survey. A
majority of respondents report that their jobs require skill In dealing with others much of the tIme (57% of
men and 70% of women). Mound 90% of MRS men and women report their work environments to be
friendly most of the time. Three-quarters of men and women report having freedom to decide itow they do
their work much of the time. Most men (81%) and women (73%) believe they axe paid fairly, though,

surprisingly, fewer than half of the men (43%) and women (35%) believe that their pay depends on theIrJob
performance. Almost no HItS workers believe they are being discriminated against because of their age, and
fewer than a fifth of men and women believe that younger people axe given preference over older people.
Among both men and women, 80-90% reJect the idea that employers or fellow-workers exert presswe to

retire. Finally, about a third of older men and women work on jobs where they believe they would be
allowed to move to a less demanding job with less pay.2' In general, most of these employees seem to like

work: less than a third would retire if they lost their jobs, and more that two-thinis state that they "would
continue to work even If they did not need the money".
13

Respondents are also asked whether their jobs require paxtlcular physical and mental requirements.

Two-thirds of the HRS men and women say their jobs require physical effort at least some of the time, what
these requirements include stooping, repetitive work, and keeping a fast pace on the Job. More than halt of
the women but fewer men report needing good eyesight and intense concentration almost alt of the time. This
may

be because more women than men use computers at work (28% venus 14%). Almost half of the HItS

workers agree that they could perfomi better with more training; more than half state that their Job is
becoming more difficult over time; and two-thirds report substantial stress on their Jobs.

Wealth Measures
The KItS promises greatly improved measurement of financial status as compared to prior surveys.
Wave 1 results on economic status in the HRS are discussed elsewhere by Moon, Juster and Abrams (this

issue) and wealth measures axe discussed by Smith (this issue). Eventually all the different explanations lot
asset accumulation and decumutalion should be Integrated with those for retirement, savings, consumption, and
bequests.

Other Factors Relevant to Retirement Analysis
The MRS incorporates a richer and more reliable set of Indicators of health status. family suuctwe,
and disability plan participation than have ever before been available In previous surveys of retirement-age

people. Knowledge of these will improve social scientists ability to measure older workers' opportunity set
and should facilitate estimation of key behavioral parameters in retirement models. (liven the ceniral
importance of health status in detemaining retirement behavior. careM estimation of health and disability
status will both improve understanding of their effects on retirement, and should also reduce blat In retirement
models which might otherwise result from imprecise measurement of the impact of poor health on retirement
decisions.

The MRS peunits Improved modeling of retirement decisions In a family setting. Earlier surveys did

not provide information on both spouses' health and disability status, a shortcoming which makes It difficult to
detennine how poor health of the husband Influences the wife's work and retirement behavior and vice versa.
Moreover the MRS collects data on each spouse's earnings, pension, Social Security arid employment

opportunities independently, offering better quality data than heretofore available?' The MRS also often good
14

information on other family members besides spouses, recognizing that older waters' labor supply decisions

respond to family needs and resowtes as a whole. This Infonnation on family status can be used to assess

older peoples retions to changes in household structure including divorce, migration, and death of family
members.

IV. Data Matching and Estimation in the FIRS
As of this writing, there remain some questions about the Has which will be important to resolve

as

the study goes forward. One issue is that none of the proposed data matching efforts have yet been
completed, thus delaying for a time analyses of the fully-integrated file using merged HRS respondents'

questionnaires with their social security records, employer-supplied pension descriptions, and health Insurance

files. The likely match rate between pension- and health insurance-covered workers Is not currently known.
since it depends on benefit plan descriptions supplied

by their employers which have not yet been completely

prcicesset The MRS staff has thus tar concentrated on cleaning and entering pension descriptions received. bul

no information is yet available on the extent of the match rate between covered employees and plan receipt

In the event that the plan descriptions cannot be obtained from MRS respondents fins, pension files
and
maintained by the US. Department of Labor will be used as bkup." The expectation Is that a matched

useable set of pension plan descriptions will be available to researchers In the late fall of 1994. Less
infonuation Is currently available about the eventual availability of employer-provIded health insurance data.

A survey instrument was developed and fielded by the MRS staff In 1993 for waters supplying locator
infonnation on their plans, but data quality and match rates are not presently known.
Many questions also remain regarding the linkage of HRS and social security earnings records files.

Initial tallies show that 9,498 of the age-eligible FIRS respondents granted pennisslon to match social secwity
earnings records, out of the full set of 12,654 IndivIduals. Of those who granted this permissIon, 95% (9089)
had valid Social Security numbers. The Social Security Administration receIved 93% of these loans (8416)
within the 60 days required in order to have the data released; current plans call for the remainIng 673 to be

recontacted in order to obtain fresh

releases.

It is anticipated that the fIRS data merged with all available files Including earnings records will be
made available in the Fall of 1994 in a variety

of formats. Decisions regarding
15

which specific variables will

be released have not yet been male, though a gxoup of research and policy advisers is working with 15K to

sktrJi the kinds of summary data that will be male available. It sms likely dIaL a file intended for public
use wilt contain masked social security earnings profiles and summary benefit anounls Including respondents'

Average Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIME) and Primary Insurance Amounts (NA) from Social Security.
Pension wealth amounts will also be appended to the file using the pension software mentioned earlier along

with each persons earnings history and plan description. Although final decisions have not been made on the

exact variables to be included in the data file, it Is probable that several different pension and social security
wealth measures will be calculated using different scenarios. This public use file will carry with it broad
geographic identifiers (probably Census divisions), but nothing which would allow a data user to locate a
respondent precisely by. say, state of residence. A second file will also be created which includes more
detailed Social Security information, and a thud which includes more geographic detail (but with the summary

Social Security information). These last two files will carry with them restricted access and prohibitions
against merging them with each other or other HRS file&

V. ConclusIon
The Health and Retirement Survey offers researchers anple scope to explore current practices and to

answer outstanding questions about retirement. The survey also affords new information with which to
evaluate cu'renr programs and improve policy desIgn for the futwe. This is because the survey contains better
measures than have ever before been available of older peoples' opportunities and constraints, as well as

insights into health and retirement behavIor for the generation on the verge of retizement Critically important
questions can be addressed with the survey because of its rIchness of detail and linkages with Social Security

records, company health and pension data, and (eventually) Medicare and Vital Statistics records. Thus, for
instance, the HRS will permit researchers to study how retirement responds to changcs In income support
programs, the Social Security System, pension regulations and trends, requlsements affecting health insurance,

spouse equity, disability policy, and others.

Endnotes

I. Previous questionnaires gathered little infonnallon on women's work and retirement, mainly because
fewer than a fifth of all women worked In the paid labor market. The NLS-OM excluded women entirely.
while the RES provided inalequate information on the labor market activities and opportunities of women.
especially married women. Minority groups were also underrepitsented In prior retirement surveys, making it
difficult to use these to study ethnic differences in retirement patterns. Another problem with previous surveys
was that they had inadequate pension data. Two recent reviews exanine strengths and weaknesses of the
existing literature on pensions and retirement see Gusunan and MItchell (1992) and Oustrnan. Mitchell and
Steinmeier (1994).

2. The Retirement History Survey (RHS) consisted of a biannual survey of people born hDm 1906 through
1911 who survived to enter the sample frame in 1969. The last wave of the RIIS was completed in 1979.
(S an pie members who survived until 1995 would be 84-89 years of age.) Numerous studies using that data
set for retirement analysis are listed in U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (1987). Respondents
to the NLS Older Men's Survey (NLS-OM) were age 45-59 In 1966, and the last regularly scheduled labor
market survey of this group occurred in 1983; an additional special survey wave was fielded In 1990 for

detlning circumstances after retirement Studies using the NLS for retirement analysis appear In the
Cenr For Human Resourves Research (1988). Respondents to the National Longitudinal Study of Mature
Women Survey (NLS-MW) were 30-44 years of age in 1967; that survey Is only now becoming available for
use In retirement research.
3. Campbell and Campbell (1976) revIew older retirement studies; more recent revIews Include Mitchell and
Fields (1982). Quinn. Burthasiser and Meyers (1990), and Sanmartino (1987). See also Gustman and
Steinmeier (1984, 1986), fluid (1990), Lumsdaine, Stock and Wise (1992), and Rust (1990).

4. The long downward participation trend has been attributed to trends In the wage structure, perhaps due to
changes in the occupational and industrial mix of Jobs disfavoring unskllied and older workers; however the
evidence does not appear to support this conclusion (Anderson, Gustman and Stelnmeler 1993). WorsenIng
health cannot explain the trend either recent evidence suggests that longer-lived recent generations are more
able to work as compared to their older counterparts avlanton, Corder and Stallard 1993). IncreasIng pension
coverage arid pension wealth coupled with lmpmvPnwi.te In Social Security benefits may be part of the
explanation (Ippollto 1990). Nevertheless Social Security Incentives and wealth effects frosts wtxpected
benefit increases appear to have a relatively small effect on retirement Incentives and outcomes (Burtless.
1986). and the effects of unexpected wealth changes. Including those from the early years of a growing Social
Security System, should eventually be fully reversed. Pension Incentives In defined benefit plans may also
contribute to earlier retirement ages, although these plans do reduce retirement In the years bdore eligibility
for early retirement age is attained (Stock and Wise 1990 a and b). Defined contribution and 40t(k) plans
embody little or no retirement incentives beyond wealth effects (Gusiman and Sfrmnnwler 1992; Ippollto
forthcoming). Early retirement window offerings and defined benefit plans do offer Inereased Incentives to
leave early (Brown this issue; Luzadis and Mitchell 1991). Thuds In pensIons raises questions not only about
their direct effects, which do work towards encouraging earlier retirement, but also raise questions on a higher
level about why defined benefit pensions continue to be changed to encourage earlier retirement
5. Empirical retirement models lend tO focus on labor market behavior alone, assuming Implicitly that savings
and consumption can be left in the background (and on rare occasions when savings and consumption are
addressed in retirement models, it is generally assumed that cItal markets are perfect). Conversely.
empirical analyses of life cycle consumption and savings tend to assume retirement Is exogenous. Relaxing
these assumptions requires gathering data on work, savings, wealth accumulation arid bequests, much of which
is being undertaken in the fiRS.

32

6. Pension and social security rules may not be well understood (CL Beahelan 1988; MItchell 1988; Gustman
and Steinmeier 1989).

7. These is an alditlonal complication that many older people pass through a partial seusement sUlon
phase between lull-time work and complete retirement; this has been variously defined as working part time,
having a low-wage job, being employed in an occupation which Is relatively undemandlng and/or flexible in
terms of hours requirements; others focus on changes In hours or wages, changes In occupation and Industry,
and working after acceptance of Social Security or pension benefits (Gustman and Stelnmeler 1984 discuss
many variants).

8. ThIs Information must be used with caution to the extent that It Is often unclear whether a worker or the
employer instigates exit from employment. In a long4enn contract setting, wheat the wage profile Is tilted or
the pension accrual is such that the wage exceeds productivity near the end of the contract, an older employee
might tend to want to work longer than was mutually agreed-on at the outset fl..near 1979).

9. All MRS data in this paper use the Alpha release tape, which contains "approximately three quarters of the
eventual HRS Wave I sanple. and has been given only very preliminary cleaning and consistency checking.
The data tape provides weights, but they are based only on the major elements of selection pobability. The
weights are not aijusted for nomesponse bias nor for some minor elements of selection probability." (MRS
-

1993)

10. Some people in the Has have no extended period of earlier labor fate participation, so measuring
retirement as exhibiting zero attachment to the labor force overstates the extent of transitions out of the labor
force. For exan pie, in answer to the self reported retirement status question (variable 4901), 910 individuals In
the Alpha tape Indicate that the question Is not relevant, and 1328 Indicate that they are hilly retired. Thus In
comparison with the number of people who Indicate that they are retired, two thirds as many people Indicate
that the question is not relevant to them because the Individual doesn't work for pay or Is a homemaker, or
hasn't worked [or pay for 10 or more years. For purposes of comparability between the objective and self
reported measures, individuals who report that the self reported retirement status question Is not relevant were
counted as retired. Excluding these individuals reduces the percentage self reporting that they were retired by
about one and a half percentage points for men and by about fourteen percentage points for women.

II. Reverse flows are discussed by Quinn. Burkhauser and Meyers (1990) ad Rust (1990).

12. While HRS questions about past jobs is less complete than about employees' Current jobs, survey
length precluded the inclusion of an entire job history.
13. Because the MRS focuses on Individuals and fnllies. It Is not nationally representative of employer
practIces. As a result, the survey can make only a modest contribution to answering the question of why
companies offer the particular compensation and employment policies they do. Analysts who model
retirement behavior from the supply side should nevertheless be aware that workers' preferences may be
correlated with company charactatstlca, to the extent that employers design compensatIon packages to attract
and keep employees with specific attributes. in particular It may be controversial for MRS-users to assume
that pay and benefits axe exogenous determinants of retirement outcomes (for a discussion of this Issue In the
pension literature, see Gusunan and Mitchell 1992 and Gustznan, Mitchell and Stelnmeler, 1994; studIes of
labor demand appear in Hanennesh 1993).
14. Some of rite often cited inverted U-shaped age-earnings profile Is due to change of employers and hours
reductions nong older workers, according to a study of the Retixenrent History Study (Gustman and
Steinmeier, 1985). EarnIngs appear to decline less with age among workers who remain with the sane
employer as they grow older.

33

15. Table 2 covers currently employed workers with valid annual hours; earnings figures are median anounts
atnong all individuals whose usual hours places them In one or the other of these categories. Median fiuilIme
hourly and weekly wages for men are based on 2,111 observations, while the couespondlng part-time wages
are based on only 148 observations. Earnings In 1991 are based on 1,939 observatIons for full-time earnings,
and 123 observations for part-time earnings. In the case of women, these axe 1.699 hill-tIme and 331
pan-time wage observations for hourly and weekly wages, and 1,563 and 282 observations for full-time and
pan-time earnings in 1991.
It should also be noted that differences between means are smaller than the differences between the
medians. Men employed MI-time average 81% more than part-timers on an annual basis ($36,769 venus
$20288), and the mean of the usual hourly wage variable is actually less icr full-timers than for part-timers
(SI 823 venus $27.06 per hour). The latter finding Is not due solely to outliers, since the third quartile value
(or pan-timer's usual wage exceeds the third quartile value for the full-time wage ($21.64 for pan-timers
versus $19.95 br MI-timers). It should be noted that the part-time lnfomiatlon Is based on a sample of only
148 observations, of which 49 are self employed individuals whose mean usual hourly wage is $30.04.
Among women HItS respondents. mean values are closer for hill and part-tIme workers, but once again the
hourly wage For pail-time self-employed exceeds that for the full-time self-employed ($15.33 per how for
part-timers versus $11.19 for MI-timers). In both cases It Is possible that selectivity bias favors Individuals
who choose part-time work. Also, there may be some Individuals who report unusually or temporarily low
levels of hours worked, raising calculated hourly wages.
16. These numbers combine the responses from a question regarding whether the Individual can reduce or
increase hours of work, with another on whether the worker would like to change hours given that he or she
cannot We recognize that constraints on work hours axe not necessarily inefficient. One reason is that they
may reflect the terms of an implicit contract which supplies backlonded compensation despite productivity
which flattens or even balls with age- In this event workers will want to supply too much labor late In lIft.
and a mechanism must be found for terminating the contract azear 1979). Other reason that hours may be
inflexible are fixed costs of employment and requirements for coordination In team production.

17. Studies on this problem ate reviewed by Hurd (1990). On the other hand Beruheim concluded about the
RHS that "..people seem to be reasonably competent at foaming relatively accurate expectations conditional

ontheinforinarionthaitheydochoosetouse. Inaddition,itlssomewbatcomfExthlgtonotethatfew
individuals exhibit the kind of extreme optimism that might be responsible for catastrophic error in financial
planning; Indeed, there is a general bias toward conservatlsrC (1988: p.314)
18. The Survey of Consumer Finances (SC?) and National Longiwdinal Study of Mature Women
(NLS-MW) are the only nationally available surveys which provide matched employer pension data. The
number of retirees in the SCF is relatively small. Rn-side pension plan details on the MIS-MW were Just
coded in mid-1993 and retirement analysis with the data set has not yet utilized the employer provided plan
descriptions.

19. The percent unionized in the HItS is about 26%, a finding virtually identical to the Current Population
Survey Ugure for 45-64 year olds (Cunne, Hirsch and Macpherson 1990).
20. BenefIt xcmai varies among plans with formulas of different types and depends on such factors as
sljustments in the benefit fonnuta in future years. the extent of post-retirement adjustments in benefits, and
other [actors that vary among plans. For a discussion see Mitchell (1992) and Gustman and Steinmeler
(1989).

21. Note that the early retirement windows questions must be linked to a specific job on the basis of dates of
employment (Brown, this issue).
22. Calculating pension wealth, and the changes in pension wealth if retirement Is deferred, requires that the
analyst know each worker's expected retirement age and how benefits are likely to change If retirement Is
deferred. In addition spousal benefits must be taken into account, as must temporary early retirement

23. For further discussions of this issue see Hunt and McGarry (this issue).
24. This paper does not summarize retirement patterns or elements of the opportunity set for MRS
respondents falling outside the age range of 51 to 61. who generally appear In the data file because they are
spouses of age-eligible snple members. Corisideivd by themselves, these individuals axe not ceptesentative
of their age gmup in the population. However data on these people will be of Immense Importance to analyses
of faxuily retirement behavior, since these individuals axe representative of spouses of a population falling

within the age range.

25. To measure the actual changes in the pension, consideration Is being given to collecting employer
provided plan descriptions at other than the base year.
