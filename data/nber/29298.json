    "abstract": "\n\nTaiwan was perhaps the first developing country to adopt an export-oriented trade strategy after World War II. The factors usually associated with big shifts in policy\u2014a macroeconomic crisis, a change in political power or institutions, lobbying by export interests, pressure from international financial institutions\u2014were not present; it was ideas that were key. In 1954, economist S. C. Tsiang proposed that Taiwan boost export earnings rather than squeeze import spending to deal with its chronic shortage of foreign exchange. He recommended a currency devaluation to establish a realistic exchange rate and a market-based system of foreign exchange allocation to end the inefficient rationing by the government. Four years later, a leading policymaker, K. Y. Yin, fought for the adoption of Tsiang\u2019s proposal, helping clear the way for Taiwan\u2019s phenomenal growth in trade.\n\n",
