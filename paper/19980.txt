ABSTRACT
This paper evaluates the impact of tapering “news” announcements by Fed senior policy makers on
financial markets in emerging economies. We apply a panel framework using daily data, and find that
emerging market asset prices respond most to statements by Fed Chairman Bernanke, and much less
to other Fed officials. We group emerging markets into those with “robust” fundamentals (current
account surpluses, high international reserves and low external debt) and those with “fragile” fundamentals
and, intriguingly, find that the exchange rates of the robust group (and lesser extend equity prices and
CDS spreads) were more adversely affected to tapering news than the fragile group. The cumulative
effects of tapering announcements after a month, however, appear to be quite similar for both robust
and fragile emerging markets. We also show that more financially developed economies are more
impacted by tapering news and a plausible interpretation is that more financially developed economies
are more exposed, at least in the short-term, to external news announcements.

1. Introduction
The quantitative easing (QE) policies of the U.S. Federal Reserve in the years following
the crisis of 2008-9 included monthly securities purchases of long-term Treasury Bonds and
Mortgage Backed Securities totaling $85 billion in 2013. The cumulative outcome of these
policies has been the unprecedented increase of the monetary base, mitigating the deflationary
pressure of the crisis. The resultant lower interest rates and flattened yield curve improved
financial conditions and helped stimulate real economic activity, yet the QE policy raised
pertinent questions regarding the timing and the nature of the exit strategy [Williams (2011,
2012)]. These issues came to fore in 2013, with vigorous and intensifying debate among policy
makers and market participants about the exit strategy from the massive monetary stimulus. The
growing frequency of public statements by the Fed’s governors and presidents, combined with
occasional press releases, have been the focus of the financial media, changing expectations and
moving market prices. This process culminated on December 18, 2013, when the Fed decided at
the FOMC meeting (as announced in the public statement) to taper its quantitative easing policy
by $10 billion per month, to $75 billion. Chairman Bernanke also projected the program to wind
down steadily through 2014 and conclude by year-end, assuming the economy remains healthy.
Subsequent announcements were giving news of a gradually reduced QE, and the pattern
continued following the appointment of Chair Yellen.
An important feature of quantitative easing and unprecedentedly low U.S. interest rates is
that it led to large short-term capital inflows to a number of emerging markets, which in turn led
several to impose capital controls, such as Brazil, Indonesia, South Korea, and others (Ahmed
and Zlate, 2013). Quantitative easing led the U.S. dollar to be the funding currency in large-scale
carry trade activity with Emerging Markets as the target currencies. The concern with tapering is
the flipside: potentially disruptive large-scale capital outflows from Emerging Markets as carrytrade activity is unwound in expectation of tapering (and, eventually, reduction in the Fed
balance sheet through sales of assets, not just reduction in the pace of purchases) and hints at
future interest rate increases. Large capital outflows could create disruptions in financial markets,
and eventually real economic activity, in Emerging Markets.
This paper evaluates whether tapering announcements has disrupted financial markets in
emerging economies. We investigate the impact of tapering “news” announcements by Fed
2

senior policy makers on financial asset prices in Emerging Markets. The Emerging Markets
financial asset prices of interest are national stock markets, exchange rates, and CDS spreads.
These reflect a broad spectrum of the potential effects of tapering, where we would expect
greater likelihood of tapering, and hence capital outflows, from Emerging Markets, to cause a
fall in equity markets, depreciation of exchange rates and an increase in CDS spreads (reflecting
greater uncertainty and risk in sovereign bond markets). In terms of Fed “news,” we focus on
statements from Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke, Federal Reserve Board Governors and
Federal Reserve Bank Presidents, as well as FOMC statements and minutes. Our presumption is
that it is important to differentiate between announcements/statements by the Chair, as the public
face and most important Fed policymaker, and other Fed policymakers (Governors and
Presidents).
We employ daily data during Nov. 2012- Oct. 2013. Statements about the likelihood of
future tapering, or scaling back the large-scale asset purchase program (LSAP), began to emerge
in late 2012, marking the beginning of our sample period. However, during this period there we
also frequent and forceful statements by Fed officials about the need to continue quantitative
easing, so these statements were also included as “news” in our investigation both to address
issues of symmetry and judge market impacts.
The methodology of the paper is a quasi-event study, akin to Dooley and Hutchison
(2009), tracing the impact of evolving narrative about the expectation of future tapering, as
revealed to the public through the news media, on key emerging market prices. We use a panel
fixed effect framework using daily data with a variety of models to evaluate the impact of
“news” on the three assets prices (stock market, exchange rate and CDS spreads). Moreover, we
explore whether market responses to tapering “news” are different across emerging markets,
perhaps differentiated by the relative strength of their economic fundamentals. In particular, we
exploit the heterogeneity among the emerging markets, evaluating the association between asset
price movements and key characteristics associated with “fragility” or “robustness” of a country,
where these characteristics are defined by their current account, international reserve and foreign
indebtedness positions.
Previewing results, we find that Emerging Market asset prices respond most to statements
by Fed Chairman Bernanke, and much less to the frequent, divergent and sometimes inconsistent
statements by other Fed officials. This finding is consistent with the power of the Chairman to
3

set and impact the agenda, and with the advantage of more frugal and clear communication. We
group Emerging Markets into those with “robust” fundamentals (10 countries) and those with
“fragile” fundamentals (16 countries) and, intriguingly, find that stronger countries, on average,
were generally more adversely exposed in the short-run to tapering news than the countries with
weak fundamentals, especially in the depreciation of their currencies. In particular, the exchange
rate depreciated in both groups immediately following tapering news from Chairman Bernanke,
yet the depreciations of the stronger group were three times as large as the weaker group.
Looking at these linkages in detail, we find that higher current account balances, higher foreign
exchange rate reserves and lower external debt are associated with greater exchange rate
depreciation following Bernanke tapering announcements. Over the period of a month, however,
we find asset price movements to tapering announcements are quite similar for both the fragile
and robust groups. Finally, we find that more financially developed emerging markets were also
more affected by Bernanke tapering announcements.
A possible interpretation of these findings is that countries with weaker fundamentals and
less financial development were less exposed to the inflows triggered by quantitative easing, and
exchange rates responded less, in line with the conjecture that being closer to financial autarky
provides deeper insulation from financial news. The flipside is that tapering news had less
impact on exchange rates in these countries. Yet, these findings are also consistent with a less
sanguine interpretation, reflecting financial markets initial inattention to tail risks, overlooking
the vulnerability of the weaker emerging markets to the adverse implications of higher future
global interest rates. Indeed, in the last quarter of 2013, financial markets re-focused attention on
the fragile emerging markets, with depressed financial asset prices of “the Fragile Five,” -Brazil, India, Indonesia, South Africa, Turkey, a sub group of the weaker emerging markets.1
Interesting, however, it appears that differential responses between the fragile and robust group
tend to dissipate over time.
The methodology of our paper complements Eichengreen and Gupta (2014), who used
data for exchange rates, foreign reserves and equity prices between April and August 2013 to
analyze who was hit and why. They concluded that better fundamentals did not provide
1

The market inattention to tail risks was vividly illustrated by the Euro crisis, where the pre-crisis sovereign spreads
of Greece, Portugal and Spain were comparable to that of Germany and other Eurozone core countries (Aizenman,
Hutchison, and Jinjarak, 2013). See also Aizenman, Binici, and Hutchison (2013) for overview of other issues in the
pricing of risk during the euro crisis.

insulation. Instead, countries with larger markets experienced more pressure on the exchange
rate, foreign reserves and equity prices. Our focus on the event methodology allows us to trace
the immediate impact effect of the coming news on expectation of adjustment, as reflected in the
changes of key prices triggered by the news.
The next section presents the data and methodology of the study. Section 3 presents the
main results. Section 4 presents extensions and robustness checks of the basic models. Section 5
concludes.

2. Data and Methodology
2.1 Data
Our objective is to evaluate the transmission of U.S. tapering “news” to financial markets
in emerging markets. In undertaking this analysis, we consider both announcements associated
with support (or actions) of quantitative easing as well as tapering. During the period of time
under investigation, November 27, 2012 through October 3, 2013, there were numerous
statements in support of both policies by Chairman Bernanke, Federal Reserve Governors,
Federal Reserve Bank Presidents and FOMC statement following meetings, and FOMC minutes
from past meetings. This allows us to evaluate the symmetry of the effects of the
announcements, both for QE and Tapering, but also for different sources of the statements. In
particular, we focus on six types of announcements from the Federal Reserve: statements by Fed
Chairman Bernanke, either in support of further quantitative easing (QE) or tapering (Tap);
release of statements following the FOMC meetings either supporting further QE or Tap; and
statements by Governors of the Federal Reserve System (other than Bernanke) or by Presidents
of the Federal Reserve Banks either supporting QE or Tap.
To gather this information, we conducted two sets of news searches on Bloomberg. The
first search was for the keywords “QE Federal.” Additionally, to focus on the tapering aspect of
the QE announcements another search was performed for the keywords "Federal Reserve Bank
of" “QE” and “Fed Taper”. A filter was applied to select "News" for both searches. To verify
whether the announcement and speech “news” were coded consistently with how they were
perceived by the markets in the U.S. (not emerging markets), we examined articles and other
publications from the Factiva database. We utilized the date and topic filtering available in the
database to solicit descriptions of the perception as well as the corresponding market reactions of
5

the announcement/speech. We closely examined each of the original Bloomberg coding for
announcements to determine whether they matched the perceptions found in the Factiva
publications. There were many more announcements/statements/speeches on these topics than
were coded. In order to be coded as either supporting further (or continuing) QE or Tapering, the
announcements needed to be unambiguous.
Table 1 presents some summary statistics on our announcements as well as examples of
announcement coding and the division between “tapering” and “quantitative easing.” We found
3 cases (7 cases) where Chairman Bernanke clearly indicated tapering was a favored policy
option (further or continuing QE was a favored policy option); 5 cases where the FOMC
statements/minutes clearly favored QE (and none clearly favoring Tapering); and rough balance
between Governors/Presidents speaking unambiguously in favor of QE (22 cases) or Tapering
(26 cases).
We consider three main conduits through which these variables may affect emerging
markets: daily changes in national stock markets (log first differences), daily changes in foreign
exchange rates (log first differences), and daily changes in CDS spreads (in basis points). If
tapering is expected to reduce financial flows to emerging markets, then we would expect
national equity markets to fall, exchange rates to depreciate and (perhaps) CDS spreads to rise.
We focus on 26 emerging markets, shown in Table 2. (The “fragile” and “robust” groups and
statistics are explained below). Emerging markets were required to have stock market and CDS
price data for the entire sample period to be included in the sample.
2.2 Methodology
We employ panel fixed effect estimation techniques to estimate the impact of U.S.
Federal Reserve announcements on financial market prices in emerging markets. We estimate a
panel data model of the following form:
(1)

∆
,

where ∆

is the log first difference in foreign exchange rates, national equity markets or the

change in CDS spread for country

(

at time .

) are statements supporting

tapering (further quantitative easing) by Chairman Bernanke at time t;
(

) are statements by Federal Reserve Board Governors or Federal Reserve Bank
6

Presidents in support of tapering (further quantitative easing); and

are official

statements following FOMC meetings supporting further quantitative easing. (No official FOMC
statements supporting tapering were identified during this sample period).
We find no evidence of dynamic adjustment in asset price movements (log first
differences in equity markets and exchange rates, first differences in CDS spreads) and
considered all news events emanating from the U.S. as strictly exogenous for emerging markets.
We therefore estimate the model as a static panel with country fixed effects. We report robust
standard errors clustered with countries, and do not find any evidence of serial correlation in
residuals. To take time differences between U.S. and Asian markets countries into account, all
Fed announcements (independent variables) are lagged one day for countries including South
Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, China, Indonesia, India, Pakistan. For the rest of
countries, news events are entered in the model contemporaneously.
Recognizing the substantial heterogeneity among the 26 emerging markets, we grouped
the emerging markets according to three fragility/strength criteria: current account deficits or
surpluses; low or high international reserves; and high or low external debts.2 We estimated the
effects of “news” on the full sample, as well as the two sub-groups (“robust” and “fragile”). We
also grouped countries by their level of financial development (“low” or “high”). As discussed in
the introduction, we anticipate different reactions to news depending on the state of the emerging
market economy.

3. Results
3.1 Full Sample Results
Table 3 reports the impact of the tapering and QE news on the stock market indices,
exchange rates, and sovereign spreads for the full sample of 26 emerging markets during
November 27, 2012-October 3, 2013. These regression results summarize the change of market
prices in the 24 hour window following the news.
Tapering: Bernanke’s tapering news was associated with significant drops in stock
market indices and exchange rate depreciations, but no significant impact on sovereign spreads.
2

Low international reserve level is defined as a reserves/GDP ratio below 20%, and low external debt is defined an
external debt/GDP ratio less than 34 %. Both cut-off points are the median values of their respective samples.

7

This may reflect the expectation of reduced capital inflows and carry-trade activity to emerging
markets, with less investment in equity markets. Not surprisingly, tapering news doesn’t seem to
impact CDS spreads on sovereign debt. By contrast, numerous and frequently quite vigorous
statements in support of tapering by Federal Reserve Bank Presidents had little discernible effect
on emerging market financial prices—equities, exchange rates nor CDS spreads—during our
sample period. (No tapering news as attributable to Fed Governors during this period, only
Federal Reserve Bank Presidents). This may be because one of the Fed Presidents—Fisher of the
Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas -- made many public statements advocating tapering (9 of our 26
events) that may have been discounted by financial markets due to their frequency and
predictability of the message. (The other most vocal advocate for tapering was Philadelphia
Federal Reserve Bank President Plosser with five news events during the sample period). No
explicit and unambiguous news in support of tapering in FOMC announcements was coded
during this period.
Quantitative Easing: Bernanke’s QE news, symmetrically, was associated with strong
exchange rate appreciation in Table 3. Exchange rates also significantly appreciated in response
to QE news contained in FOMC statements and in announcements by Governors/Presidents,
where the FOMC had the largest impact and Governors/Presidents least impact. The support for
QE was broader than tapering, including Governors (Vice Chair Yellen and Governors Duke and
Stein) and many Presidents. President Rosengren (Boston) and Bullard (St. Louis) spoke the
most frequently (four times each) in support of continuing QE. In addition, consistent with the
very strong impact of FOMC QE news exchange rate appreciation, these statements also had a
large impact in pushing up stock market prices.
3.2 Differential Effects of Tapering
As discussed above, we expect tapering news to have different effects depending on the
strength of a country’s international “fundamentals.” Full sample results, in turn, could mask
differential effects due to group heterogeneity associated with disparate fundamentals. To
address this issue, Table 4 reports the impact of the tapering and QE news on market prices,
allowing comparison between countries having current account deficits/surpluses (Table 4A);
low/high international reserves (Table 4B); and high/low external debts (Table 4C), respectively.
(Table 2 presents the external positions of countries and the grouping between “robust” and
8

“fragile” countries). We also group countries in terms of these fundamentals, robust and fragile,
where the robust group are countries meeting at least two “strong” criteria [current account
surplus, higher reserves, and low debt], and the fragile group meet at least two “weak” criteria
[current account deficits, low reserves, and high debt]. The countries in each group are shown in
Table 2 and Table 5 reports the regression results for these two groups.
This comparison reveals asymmetric and divergent patterns depending on whether the
news is emanating from Bernanke’s statements, as opposed to Governors/Presidents and the
FOMC, and between the groups with robustness or fragile fundamentals. In particular,
Bernanke’s tapering news had much larger exchange rate depreciation effects on countries with
(a) current account surpluses as opposed to deficits (four times larger, Table 4A), (b) high
international reserves contrasted with low reserves (three times larger, Table 4B), and (c) low
external debt rather than high debt (about half as much larger, Table 4C).3 The analysis of the
two groups, fragile or robust shown in Table 5, also indicates that exchange rate depreciation is
statistically significant in both cases at the time of Bernanke tapering announcements but more
than three times larger in the robust group (0.409) compared with the fragile group (0.111).4
By contrast, tapering announcements by Fed Governors or Presidents tapering news had
little or no discernable impact on exchange rates in emerging markets, regardless of whether they
were classified as robust/weak in fundamentals, had current account surpluses or deficits, had
high/low international reserves or had low/high external debt. This is consistent with the full
sample results.
Bernanke tapering news increased CDS spreads very substantially for countries with
robust fundamentals (4.0 pts.; Table 5), and especially for those countries with current account
surpluses (3.8 pts.; Table 4A) and high international reserves (3.2 pts; Table 4B), while having
little or no effect on fragile countries (except for increasing spreads marginally, 0.77 pts., for
those with high external debt positions). And, similar to the full sample results, tapering
announcements by Fed Governors/Presidents had little effect on CDS spreads, lowering them
overall by only -0.45 (Table 5; significant at 10% level), apparently attributable to the small
decline in CDS in the high-reserves group (-0.37; Table 4B).

3

The differences between the groups are statistically significant in the cases of exchange rates (chi-square of 4.56
and probability of 0.033) and international reserves.
4
This difference is statistically significant with a chi-square of 4.31 (probability 0.038).

9

Bernanke tapering news lowered equity market values in emerging markets for the full
sample (-3.28 percent; Table 3), and in the countries with low external debt positions (Table 4C).
And, similar to the full sample results, group results based on fundamentals indicated that
Governor/Presidents tapering announcements did not have any significant impact on stock
markets.
Intriguingly, Tables 4 and 5 imply that Bernanke’s tapering news depreciated exchange
rates most in countries typically associated with strong international positions – countries
running current account surpluses, having high reserves and low debt- and our aggregate of
robust countries. A possible interpretation is that fragile economics were less exposed to
financial flows in search of higher yields during the earlier QE years; thereby they were expected
to be less exposed to the immediate impact of the tapering news.
3.3 Differential Effects of Quantitative Easing
The effects of QE news also showed substantial variation depending on who made the
statement and international position of the country. Bernanke’s QE news was associated with
strong exchange rate appreciation in the full sample (-0.14; Table 3) as well as in both fragile
and robust groups (Table 5) where the impact effects virtually identical (-0.13 and -0.15,
respectively). Appreciation was an even more dominating characteristic of countries with strong
current account positions, high international reserves and high international debt5.
Significant exchange rate appreciations were also associated with FOMC QE statements
in the full sample, in both fragile and weak groups (Table 5), and in all of the sub-samples (Table
4). Interesting, no asymmetric effects were found between those with weak or strong
fundamentals—the coefficients on the exchange rate response to FOMC QE support news were
virtually identical (and significant) across subgroups.
Differential effects emerge again in stock market and CDS responses to QE. Bernanke
and FOMC QE news were associated with higher stock prices of the fragile group, but did not
impact the stock prices of the strong group. By contrast, Governor/President QE news was
associated with lower stock market indices for both fragile and robust groups (Table 5), and
coefficient estimates are similar in magnitudes regardless of international fundamental positions.

5

The difference between depreciation in countries with high and low international debt positions is statistically
significant with a chi-square value of 3.25 (probability 0.072).

10

In terms of CDS spreads, Fed Governor/President QE news had no discernable effect in the full
sample but appears to raise spreads for the robust group of countries (Table 5). This result stems
from the rise in CDS spreads in countries with high international reserve positions. However,
somewhat at odds with the other results, spreads climbed in those countries with relatively high
external debt positions. The deferential impacts of the news source reflect the much higher
frequency of Governors/Presidents news [26 tapering, 22 QE] in comparison to Bernanke’s news
[3 tapering, and 7 QE] and FOMC QE news [5]. On balance, the market was focused and reacted
more on the scarcer and more coherent news from Bernanke and the FOMC, than the frequent
and diffused news from Governors/Presidents. Governors/Presidents news reflected the inner
debate among heterogonous and non-coordinated views of FED’s senior officials, whereas
Bernanke’s and FOMC QE news were viewed as much clearer signals regarding the stance of
FED’s policies. These interpretations are also supported by the results reported for the full
sample (Table 3).
3.4 Robust and Fragile Fundamentals and Tapering Dynamics
Emerging market countries with robust (fragile) fundamentals—those with current
account surpluses (deficits), high (low) international reserves and low (high) external debt—were
most (less) affected by tapering announcements, particularly with respect to exchange rates.
Robust (fragile) economies seemed to have been more (less) exposed to financial flows in search
of higher yields during the earlier QE years, and also more (less) exposed when tapering started,
i.e. markets may have expected capital flow reversals to occur mainly in countries that had
experienced the largest inflows initially. However, this may simply be the impact effect. Fragile
economies could have experienced tapering effects with some delay.
This interpretation is consistent with Figures 1-6. Figures 1, 2 and 3 show the impact of
Bernanke tapering announcements on stock prices, exchange rates and CDS spreads,
respectively, for the fragile and strong groups. Though we find the impact effects of Bernanke
tapering news depreciated exchange rates most in the robust group, the fragile group experienced
more depreciation after several months (Figure 1). And while Bernanke tapering caused CDS
spreads to rise substantially more in the robust group, CDS spreads eventually climbed more in
the fragile group (Figure 3). Stock prices did not show significant differential impact effects

11

across the fragile and robust groups, but over time it appears that the robust group has performed
less well.
More formally, Table 6a considers the differential impact of announcements on
cumulative asset price changes over 21 business days (approximately one-month). The negative
cumulative effect of Bernanke tapering news on fragile economies is somewhat larger on equity
prices than in robust economies. The cumulative impact on exchange rate depreciation in fragile
and robust economies following Bernanke tapering announcements is very similar. By contrast,
fragile countries experienced twice the average cumulative increase in CDS spreads (45 basis
points) as did robust countries (18 basis points) in response to Bernanke tapering
announcements.

by

the

Fed

Governors/Presidents is more mixed—relatively small declines in equity markets for the fragile
group, greater exchange rate depreciation for the fragile group and much larger (though not
statistically significant) rise in CDS spreads for the fragile group.
Overlapping events is a major drawback when measuring longer duration effects using
our methodology. To address this issue, we estimated the effects of Bernanke tapering news
alone on cumulative asset price changes for non-overlapping announcements. Non-overlapping
events in this instance led to a 19-day post-event window for the asset price changes and are
presented in Table 6b. The results are virtually identical to the results presented in the previous
table.
Figures 4, 5 and 6, reporting the stock market indices, exchange rates, and sovereign
spreads of Brazil and Turkey (relatively fragile countries) and Hungary (relatively robust
country), during November 27, 2012-October 3, 2013. Again, towards the end of the sample
period the fragile countries were not insulated from the tapering news. Indeed, over time the
fragile countries were hit harder than the stronger countries.
The impact of the tapering news focused first on the strong countries, probably in
anticipation of large short-run outflows of past hot money inflows. Market attention shifted
overtime to the possibility that fragile countries would find it harder to adjust to the higher U.S.
interest rates inducing by future tapering, leading to large adjustments in last quarter of 2013.
Arguably, the initial large effect of the tapering news, impacting mostly the strong countries may
also reflect financial markets’ initial inattention to tail risks, overlooking the vulnerability of the
weaker emerging markets to the adverse implications of higher future global interest rates.
12

Indeed, in the last quarter of 2013, financial markets re-focused attention on the fragile emerging
markets, and hammered the prices of “the Fragile Five,” -- Brazil, India, Indonesia, South Africa,
Turkey, a sub group of the weaker emerging markets.

4. Extensions
4.1 Fragile and Robust Groupings
In the previous sections we distinguished between fragile and robust economies using the
following criteria: (a) median values for external debt (above the median indicates fragile, and
below median indicates robust) and international reserves (above median indicates robust and
below median indicates fragile), and (b) current account surpluses (robust) and deficits (fragile).
We modify these criteria to be median values for all three fundamentals, i.e. changing our criteria
for current accounts from surplus/deficits to above/below the median values in the sample. In
Table 7 we present results where the classification of a “robust” current account is any value
above the median (-1.24) and “fragile” any country with a value below the median. This gives
somewhat different groupings for robust/fragile, with Argentina, Lativa and Pakistan moving
from the fragile to robustness group. Table 7 results are almost identical to Table 4a, however,
and the main results are qualitatively not affected by this change in the robust/fragile groups.

4.2 Financial Development
Another issue is whether the degree of financial development is a critical distinguishing
characteristic between countries in how they respond to tapering announcements. That is, is this
institutional feature important in how tapering and quantitative easing announcements affect
asset prices in emerging markets? To address this issue we use the World Economic Forum’s
“Financial Development Index,” and use the median value of the sample to divide countries into
“high” and “low” degrees of financial development. Table 8 reports the results in an analogous
fashion to Table 4.
The results indicate that countries with a high degree of financial development had larger
declines in equity markets in response to Bernanke tapering announcements than did those with
low degrees of financial development. They also experienced greater exchange rate depreciation

13

and larger increases in CDS spreads than did countries with low levels of financial development.
The “tapering response” of more financially developed (less financially developed) emerging
economies are broadly similar to those with the robust (fragile) fundamentals, providing an
alternative explanation for why this set of countries were hardest hit by tapering announcements.

4.3 U.S. Interest Rates
Another important question is whether tapering and QE announcements are transmitted to
emerging market equity prices, exchange rates and CDS spreads through U.S. interest rates only,
or is there an additional transmission channel at work. To address this issue, we included in the
baseline regression (Table 3) U.S. interest rates of various maturities. In particular, we
considered 1-month, 3-month, 6-month, 1-year, 5-year, 10-year and 20-year U.S. Treasury
interest rates, each entered separately in the regression equations.
The response of equity prices to Bernanke tapering results were very stable regardless of
which U.S. interest was included in the regression, with coefficients ranging from -0.321
to -0.428, all of which were statistically significant (compared to the baseline regression
coefficient of -0.327). Similarly, the baseline coefficient on the exchange rate from Bernanke
tapering was 0.129, compared to coefficients ranging from 0.123 to 0.225 (six of seven are
statistically significant) when U.S. interest rates were included. Bernanke tapering did not have a
significant impact on CDS spreads in the baseline regression, and was also not significant in the
seven regressions where U.S. interest rates were included. The other results are also very similar
to the baseline regressions, indicating that controlling for U.S. interest rates does not change the
transmission of tapering (or quantitative easing) “news” announcements on emerging market
asset prices. (Detailed results are not included for brevity but are available from the authors upon
request).
While we focused above on price transmission channels, operating via the exchange rate
and asset prices, some of transmission may operate through quantities, impacting the emerging
markets via capital flows (Caruana, 2012). Specifically, tapering information may change the

14

expected future cross-border bank landing (the credit channel) and portfolio flows (market risktaking).6

4.4 Interactions with Fundamentals
An alternative approach to grouping countries with respect to their common
fundamentals (“robust” or “fragile”) is to interact announcements with the level of the
fundamental (e.g. BenTap x Reserves/GDP). We conduct this analysis for exchange rates and the
five types of announcements, reporting the results in Table 9a. Table 9b reports the joint
significance tests (of the announcement coefficient and the interaction term coefficient). If
counties with stronger fundamentals are impacted more by tapering (consistent with the earlier
analysis), then we would expect a positive coefficient on BenTap x CAB/GDP (i.e. the larger the
current account surplus, the larger is exchange rate depreciation associated with a Bernanke
tapering announcement), a positive coefficient on BenTap x Reserves/GDP (i.e. the larger the
level of reserves, the larger is exchange rate depreciation associated with a Bernanke tapering
announcement) and a negative coefficient on BenTap x ExternalDebt/GDP (i.e. the larger the
level of external debt, the less is exchange rate depreciation associated with a Bernanke tapering
announcement).
Column (1) of Table 9a reports the baseline results without interaction terms (as in Table
3) for comparison purposes. Column (2) reports the interactions of tapering announcements with
the current account (CAB/GDP), column (3) reports interactions with reserves (Reserves/GDP),
column (4) reports interactions with external debt (ExternalDebt/GDP), and column (5)
combines the three sets of interaction terms into one regression.
Focusing on Bernanke tapering announcements (BenTap) in columns (2)-(4), the results
indicate that larger current account surpluses are associated with greater exchange rate
deprecation (coefficient of 0.040), larger reserves are associated with greater exchange rate
depreciation (0.012) and high external debt is associated with less exchange rate depreciation. It

The value of aggregate cross-border bond and equity investment in Emerging Market Economies increased from
$3.29 trillion at the end of 2007 to $4.46 trillion at the end of 2012, according to the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio
Investment Survey. About 85% of the increase was in the form of debt, with a much smaller part in equity. Thus,
cross-border debt investment has been a significant driver of credit growth in many Emerging markets (Mohanty,
2014). These developments may have increased the Emerging Markets vulnerability. Such borrowing may be highly
procyclical, increasing the borrowers exposure to exchange rate risk - at times of stress, sharp exchange rate
depreciations may result in further selling pressure on Emerging Market Economies.

is useful to calculate the estimated effect for the robust and fragile groups using mean and
median values (for each group) of the fundamentals. The estimated impact on exchange rates for
from BenTap for country with a mean “robust” (“fragile”) current account is 0.37 (0.14); for
reserves is 0.37 (0.16) and for external debt is 0.26 (0.25). The same basic results hold up in the
combined regression (column 5) with the exception of the interaction term with current account
balances.
The bulk of these results are therefore consistent with our earlier results, i.e. countries
with stronger fundamentals appear to be more affected by tapering announcements.

4.5 Excluding Bernanke May 22 Tapering Announcement
A natural question that arises is whether the Bernanke tapering results are entirely driven
by the market-shock of the May 22nd announcement. To address this issue, we re-estimate the
basic models estimated in Table 3 with the modification that the Bernanke tapering
announcements exclude the May 22nd observation. Interestingly, the effect of Bernanke tapering
announcements excluding May 22nd has a larger effect on equity markets (an estimated
coefficient of -0.416, compared to -0.327 in Table 3) but smaller effect on exchange rate
depreciation (0.116, and not statistically significant, compared to 0.219). The effect on CDS
spreads remains insignificant. The effects of the other announcements (e.g. other tapering and
QE) are not affected.

4.6 Individual Country Effects
We estimated our models with country fixed effects and in several formulations divided
the sample into fragile and robust economies. This subsection shows the effects of tapering
announcements by individual countries. In particular, in Table 10, we show the effects of
Bernanke tapering and President/Governor tapering announcements on asset prices for individual
countries.

and the country-specific dummy variable. This

measures the effect of tapering on a particular country. (All responses are statistically significant
at the 10% level or high unless indicated).
16

The results reported in Table 10 show substantial diversity of response across countries.
For example, Bernanke tapering is associated with decreases (increases) in stock prices in 16 of
25 (9 of 25) cases, and all responses statistically significant. While the results for the full sample
indicate an average response of -0.327 to Bernanke tapering (Table 3), the average response of
the countries experiencing declines (increases) in stock prices is -0.734 (0.498). Similarly,
Bernanke tapering is associated with depreciating currencies in 14 of 24 countries, and
appreciating currencies in 10 of 24 countries. Again the results are consistent with the full
sample response (0.219) reported in Table 3-- the average response of the 14 depreciating
countries in Table 10 is 0.438, compared an average response of -0.046 for the 10 appreciating
countries.

5. Concluding Remarks
Chairman Bernanke’s tapering news had large effects on emerging markets, resulting in
substantial drops in stock market indices and large exchange rate depreciations. This indicates
the expectation of reduced capital inflows and carry-trade activity to emerging markets, with less
investment in equity markets. By contrast, numerous and frequently quite vigorous statements in
support of tapering by Fed Presidents had little discernable effect on emerging market financial
prices—equities, exchange rates, CDS spreads—during our sample period. This may be because
one of the Fed Presidents—Fisher of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas -- made many public
statements advocating tapering (9 of our 26 events) that may have been discounted by financial
markets due to their frequency and predictability of the message. Governor/President QE
statements were associated with significant exchange rate appreciation, however, as were
statements by Bernanke and the FOMC in favor of continuing the program. Statements in
support for continuing QE was across a broad spectrum of Fed Governors (including Vice Chair
Yellen) and Federal Reserve Bank Presidents during our sample period, perhaps accounting for
the strong impact on the markets.
Our analysis also identified strong and systematic heterogeneity of adjustment to Fed
tapering (and QE) news across emerging markets. The initial impact of Chairman Bernanke’s
tapering news had the largest effect on exchange rates in the emerging markets that had
robust/strong international positions (i.e. current account surpluses, low foreign debt, high
international reserves) or had more developed financial sectors. Tapering news by Fed Presidents
17

had little or no discernable impact on exchange rates regardless of whether they were classified
as robust/weak in a combination of fundamentals, had current account surpluses or deficits, had
high/low international reserves or had low/high external debt. However, when we considered the
differential impact of announcements on cumulative asset price changes over 21 business days
(approximately one-month), the effect of Bernanke tapering news on fragile economies is: (a)
somewhat larger on equity prices than in robust economies; (b) very similar to robust economies
on exchange rate depreciation; and (c) much greater (twice the average cumulative increase) on
CDS spreads than in robust economies.
In terms of the dynamics of financial markets in robust and fragile economies, it appears
that emerging markets with more fragile international positions were also affected, especially the
‘fragile five,’ over periods extending beyond the initial impact effects of Fed tapering
announcements. These results suggest that, in the era of financial globalization, emerging market
financial markets are not insulated from expected changes in the Fed’s policy stance although it
is sensitive to the heterogeneity among countries (Powell, 2013; and Nechio, 2014).
Understanding the factors accounting for the timing and the intensity of market reactions deserve
further exploration. The greater impact of Fed news on the robust emerging markets may be
explained by anticipated balance sheet adjustments, where the size of positions and the liquidity
of markets play a role (Eichengreen and Gupta, 2014). Alternatively, market attention may shift
over time from the short run adjustment of positions, to the reassessment of the greater
adjustment challenges facing the fragile countries to the post tapering world (Sims, 2010; and
Mondria et al., 2010). Investigating the possible linkages between faster price adjustment and
less volatile future growth patterns is left for future research.

Examples of Announcements (Congressional Testimony, Speeches, FOMC statements, etc.)
Ben Tap (Bernanke Tapering): May 22, 2013 Bernanke said the Fed could “take a step down in our pace of
purchases” in the “next few meetings” in testimony to the Joint Economic Committee of Congress.
Ben QE (Bernanke Quantitative Easing): January 24, 2013 Testimony to Senate Banking Committee
“We do not see the potential costs of the increased risk- taking in some financial markets as outweighing the
benefits of promoting a stronger economic recovery. Inflation is currently subdued, and inflation expectations
appear well anchored.” Bernanke used his testimony to push back against colleagues on the Federal Open
Market Committee who favor curtailing the $85 billion in monthly bond-buying.
Gov/Pres Tap (FR Governor or FRB President Tapering): June 3, 2013
Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President John Williams said policy makers may start reducing the
pace of bond purchases over the next three months and potentially end quantitative easing by year-end. With
continued “good signs” on jobs and confidence in a “substantial improvement” I could see as “early as this
summer some adjustment, maybe modest adjustment downward, in our purchase program,” he said today in
Stockholm.
Gov/Pres QE (FR Governor or FRB President Quantitative Easing): March 27, 2013
Two regional Federal Reserve presidents said they want the Fed to keep buying bonds through the end of 2013,
while a third official said the central bank isn’t doing enough to spur economic growth.
“We should continue our large-scale asset purchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities through this
year -- although the amount may need to be adjusted up or down, depending on how the economic situation
evolves,” Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren said today in a speech in Manchester, New Hampshire. “This is
a point when we have to be patient and let our policies work,” with stimulus “firing on all cylinders,”
Chicago’s Charles Evans said to reporters.
FOMC QE (FOMC Quantitative Easing): May 1, 2013 FOMC Meeting Statement
The Federal Reserve said it will keep buying bonds at a monthly pace of $85 billion while standing ready to
raise or lower purchases as economic conditions evolve. The purchases will remain divided between $40
billion a month of mortgage-backed securities and $45 billion a month of Treasury securities.

Notes: Current account balance (in percent of GDP) and international reserves (in percent of GDP)
data is taken from IMF World Economic Outlook Data Base, and external debt (in percent of GDP)
is from the CIA World Factbook. A country is grouped under "robust" or "fragile" based on whether
it has current account surplus, is high reserves and low external debt. Thus, if at least 2 of 3 (or 3
of 3) above criteria holds, then a country is in "robust group", otherwise it is in "fragile group". Low
international reserve level is defined as a reserves/GDP ratio below 20%, and low external debt is
defined as external debt/GDP ratio less than 34 %. Both cut-off points are the median values of
their respective samples.

Notes: Tables presents panel fixed effect estimation results with robust standard errors in parentheses.
*** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1. Independent variables are log first difference of stock market index,
foreign exchange rate, and change in CDS spreads in specification (1) through (3), respectively. A
country is grouped under "robust" or "fragile" based on whether it has current account surplus, high
reserves and low external debt. Thus, if at least 2 of 3 (or 3 of 3) above criteria holds, then a country is
in "robust group", otherwise it is in "fragile group". Exchange rate estimations excludes China, CDS
spread estimation excludes China and Pakistan.

Note: Table reports the sum of coefficients of tapering events (Bernanke tapering and Governor/president
tapering) and country dummy*tapering interactions. Initial regressions include all tapering and QE events as
in our baseline regressions. Interaction terms are included for tapering only with country dummies. '#'
indicates if the sums of coefficients are not significant at 10% or lower value. All other coefficients are
statistically significant at conventional levels.
