Edgeworth Cycles Revisited

JEL No. D4,L11,L70
ABSTRACT
Some gasoline markets exhibit remarkable price cycles, where price spikes are followed by a string
of small price declines until the next price spike. This pattern is predicted from a model of competition
driven by Edgeworth cycles, as described by Maskin and Tirole. We extend the Maskin and Tirole
model and empirically test its predictions with a new dataset of daily station-level prices in 115 US
cities. One innovation is that we also examine cycling within cities, which allows controls for city
fixed effects. Consistent with the theory, and often in contrast with previous empirical work, we find
that the least and most concentrated markets are much less likely to exhibit cycling behavior; and the
areas with more independent retailers that have convenience stores are more likely to cycle. We also
find that the average gasoline prices are relatively unrelated to cycling behavior.

I. Introduction
Tremendous variation exists in the pricing strategies chosen by different
businesses and how market prices dynamically evolve in different industries. Although a
long literature in industrial organization identifies different equilibrium pricing strategies,
in many cases the models do not make clear predictions as to why firms might choose
one set of strategies in one competitive environment and choose a different set of
strategies in another competitive environment.
In this paper, we revisit the study of Edgeworth cycles in retail gasoline markets:
a remarkable pattern in prices over time when price spikes are followed by slow
reductions until the next spike. We extend the theory proposed by Maskin and Tirole
(1988) in two novel ways. First, we allow for loyal consumers who, due to geographic
differentiation, brand loyalty or unobservable preference, do not switch to competitors
offering marginally lower prices. Second, we allow firms to earn profits from goods
complementary to the primary good upon which firms compete. These two additions
provide conditions under which competitors may find it more profitable to adopt cycling
strategies rather than cost-based pricing strategies. We then empirically test the
predictions of the model using a significantly larger dataset than previous studies: daily,
station-level prices for 115 US metropolitan areas. One innovation in the paper is that we
also examine cycling within cycling and non-cycling metropolitan areas, which allows us
to control for fixed characteristics in models estimated at the ZIP code level.
Maskin and Tirole first specified a dynamic game in which firms played
Edgeworth cycle strategies in equilibrium. The model considers a dynamic Bertrand
game in which two identical competitors sequentially choose from a finite grid of prices.

2

Maskin and Tirole prove that if the discount rate is sufficiently high, an equilibrium
exists in which firms play strategies which generate Edgeworth cycles. In these
equilibria, if the opponent's price is greater than marginal cost, the firm selects the price
that just undercuts her opponent's price. If the opponent was pricing at marginal cost,
with some probability the firm relents, choosing a much higher price and allowing the
cycle of undercutting to begin again. In such an equilibrium, the market clearing price
slowly falls to marginal cost until one firm stochastically relents, which results in a price
spike.
Several papers empirically document Edgeworth cycles in retail gasoline markets.
Eckert (2003) extends the model proposed by Maskin and Tirole by introducing
heterogeneity in the market participants. Unlike the Maskin and Tirole model in which
firms split the market if they chose identical prices, Eckert considers the case in which
one firm obtains greater than half of the market when both firms choose identical prices.
Although cycle equilibria exist for all splits of the market, Eckert proves that as one
firm's proportion of demand when identical prices are chosen rises, the firm has a greater
incentive to match rather than undercut her competitor's prices. As a result, the speed at
which prices fall, and the length of the undercutting phase, are negatively related to the
asymmetry between the two participants.4 Eckert analyzes city-level prices for 19
Canadian cities and finds that market penetration of independent gasoline retailers is
negatively correlated with price rigidity, consistent with the results from his theoretical
model.

4

Eckert also shows that constant price equilibrium, which we do not consider in this paper, only exists
when firms are of relatively similar sizes.

3

Drawing on the theoretical results of Eckert, Noel (2007a) applies a Markov
switching regression to estimate the length of the undercutting and relenting phases as
well as the transition probabilities. Using ten years of weekly, city-level data for 19
Canadian cities, Noel finds that as independent retail station market share increases, more
markets exhibit cycling behavior, a result that supports the predictions of Eckert's model.
Lewis (2008) finds that prices fell more quickly in Edgeworth cycle markets than in noncycling markets following the Hurricane Rita price spike. In addition, he finds a similar
relationship between independent retailer penetration and price cycling as Noel (2007a),
using city-level data for 83 US cities.
A second set of papers examine the characteristics of Edgeworth cycles using
station-level data within particular markets. For example, Noel (2007b) estimates cycle
attributes using semi-daily data on 22 retail gasoline stations in Toronto, Canada and
Atkinson (2008) examines hourly data for 27 retail gasoline stations in Guelph, Canada.
Both Noel and Atkinson study the behavior of participants in price cycles and examine
which firms in each market are most likely to relent at the bottom of the cycle. They tend
to find that larger firms are more likely to initiate the relenting phase, whereas smaller
firms are more likely to undercut.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: section 2 offers the
extensions to the Maskin and Tirole model of Edgeworth cycles; section 3 describes the
data; section 4 reports the empirical models and results; and section 5 concludes.

II. Model

4

Consider a dynamic game in which N firms sequentially choose from a discrete
set of possible prices. We define pit as firm i's choice of price at time t, p-it as the vector of
prices of firm i's competitors, and pt as the vector of all firm prices at time t. Following
Maskin and Tirole, we focus on Markov perfect equilibria to the game, given by a set of
N reaction functions, {Ri(p-it)}. For each vector of opponent's prices, Ri(p-it) maximizes
firm i's expected current and future profits assuming all firms continue to play
their reaction functions. We specify firm i's profits in period t as
Π it = ( pit − ci )[α i + β i ( pt )]q( p it ) + γ i [α i + β i ( pt )]

(1)

The first term in the profit function corresponds to sales of the primary good for
which firm i sets price pit. The second term corresponds to additional profits accrued
from the proportion of consumers who purchase from firm i through sales of secondary
goods. In the context of retail gasoline stations, the first term corresponds to purchases of
gasoline, and the second term corresponds to purchases of other goods and services
offered by an affiliated convenience store or service station. Implicitly, we assume that
firms attract customers on the basis of the posted price of the primary good (gasoline),
and in some cases, may accrued additional profits from the secondary good (c-store
sales).
In our model, we distinguish two types of consumers. We let αi denote the
proportion of consumers “loyal” to firm i, who always purchase from firm i regardless of
the price firm i chooses to set. We do not distinguish whether a consumer is “loyal” as a
result of brand loyalty, geographic proximity or some unobservable preference. We treat
each source of loyalty as equivalent in our model, although in the empirical section, we
distinguish between loyalty arising from a preference for branded gasoline and loyalty

5

arising from geographic differentiation. βi(pt) denotes the proportion of consumers who
will switch firms in response to the relative prices offered by the firms. We assume,
without loss of generality, that all consumers are either loyal to a single firm or switch
firms depending on the relative prices – that is, for all vectors pt,

∑α

i

+ β i ( pt ) = 1 . By

i

definition, we assume that if firm i has the highest price of the N firms, βi(pt)=0.
Furthermore, we define β i as the value when firm i has the lowest price of the N firms:
the highest value βi(pt) can take. Finally, we let pi* denote the price that maximizes
profits from loyal consumers. This framework is a significant generalization of that used
in the previous literature. Maskin and Tirole consider a duopoly in which αi =0, γi =0,
βi(pi,pj) is equal to either zero, one-half or one depending on whether pi is greater than,
equal to or less than pj. Eckert allows an asymmetric split of the market when firms
choose identical prices. Following Maskin and Tirole, we use Vit(p-it) to denote firm i 's
expected profits when it is about to choose prices and firms play Markov perfect
equilibrium strategies {R1(p-1t), R2(p-2t),…, RN(p-Nt)} thereafter.5 For notational
convenience, let Vitα ( p −it ) and Vitβ ( p −it ) denote the expected profits from gasoline sold to

loyal customers and to firm-switching customers when the firm i plays Ri(p-it). Let
Witα ( p −it ) and Witβ ( p −it ) denote the expected c-store or service station profits when the
firm i plays Ri(p-it).
We begin by characterizing the relationship between parameters αi, βi, and γi, and
the expected profits earned by cycling and non-cycling firms. We prove that as the share
of “loyal” customers rises, the expected profits from playing a constant price strategy rise

5

Multiple Markov perfect equilibria (MPE) may exist - the value function depends on the particular MPE.

6

more quickly than the expected profits from playing a cycling strategy. Furthermore, if
αi is sufficiently high relative to β i , we prove that playing pi* strictly dominates all

strategies exhibiting cycling behavior. Second, we show that as γi increases, a firm will
be more willing to play a strategy exhibiting cycling behavior. For brevity, we include
proposition proofs in the appendix.

Proposition 1: Let {R1(p-1t), R2(p-2t),…, RN(p-Nt)} be a set of reaction functions

exhibiting cycling behavior. As αi increases, the expected profits earned by firm i by
playing strategy Ri(p-it) increase less quickly than the expected profits associated with
always playing pi*.

Corollary 2: There exist values of αi and β i such that firm i would prefer to always

play pi* rather than play Ri(p-it).

As the share of “loyal” customers rises, the profits associated with playing the
constant price strategy, pi*, rise more quickly than the profits associated with playing any
cycling strategy. Corollary 2 proves that if a firm has a sufficiently high proportion of
loyal customers, choosing the optimal static price for the loyal customers will dominate
any cycling strategy. Thus, if a dominant firm in a market enjoys a sufficiently great
geographic or brand advantage over a smaller rival, the larger firm may find that pricing
to maximize profits from “loyal” customers strictly dominates any strategy involving
cycling, and the smaller firm would then capture the majority of the firm-switching
customers. Our finding, that a dominant firm with a substantial number of “loyal”

7

customers may be reluctant to participate in cycles, contrasts with the theoretical results
in Eckert (2003). He finds that if the dominant firm earns a sufficiently large split of the
market when firm prices are identical, but does not enjoy any customer loyalty, the only
MPE is one exhibiting cycling behavior. .

Proposition 3: Let {R1(p-1t), R2(p-2t),…, RN(p-Nt)} be a set of reaction functions

exhibiting cycling behavior. As γi increases, the expected profits associated with playing
a strategy exhibiting cycling behavior increase more quickly than the expected profits
associated with always playing pi*.

Firm willingness to play a cycling strategy rather than pi* depends on whether the
profits gained by attracting firm-switching customers exceed the profits lost from
suboptimally pricing to loyal customers.
The Propositions provide several predictions about the characteristics of cycling
and non-cycling firms.6 Although Propositions 1 and 3 do not necessarily imply a
monotonic relationships between cycling propensity, the proportion of “loyal” customers
(αi), and profits accrued through the sales of the secondary good (γi), the results do
suggest that potential benefits to cycling are less pronounced for firms enjoying
geographic differentiation or brand loyalty or for firms deriving little profit from the
secondary good. In addition, Proposition 1 suggests that firms for which loyal customers
are a large proportion of demand are more likely to prefer a constant price to a strategy

6

Although, in this paper we focus on cycling behavior, the proposition holds for any alternative reaction
function chosen by firm i.

involving cycling.7 In the context of retail gasoline stations, we would expect that retail
stations with substantial brand loyalty or substantial geographic advantage would be less
likely to choose a strategy involving cycling. If brand loyalty is greater for branded
stations than independents, independents with substantial market presence may be more
willing to choose strategies exhibiting cycling behavior than comparably-sized branded
firms. Moreover, if branded stations compete for a subset of consumers, we expect that
markets with more than one branded station are more likely to participate in cycling
behavior. Finally, if proximity to other retail stations erodes a station’s ability to extract
a geographic rent from “loyal” customers, retailers in high station-density locations may
be more likely to participate in cycles than retailers in locations with relatively few
stations.8
Proposition 3 predicts that retailers deriving profits from goods other than the
good whose price attracts customers to a particular location would be more likely to use a
strategy involving cycling. In particular, in the context of retail gasoline, we would
expect that retail stations with convenience stores would be more likely to participate in
cycling behavior than retail stations without c-stores.
The previous propositions also suggest how the characteristics of the cycles might
be related to observable firm characteristics. Specifically, a firm might be willing to play
some but not all strategies exhibiting cycling behavior. Conditional on playing a
cycling strategy, we would expect firms with a greater proportion of loyal customers to

7

In a two firm market, a competitor of a non-cycling firm would undercut the price of the non-cycling firm.
With more than two firms, though, the proposition does not rule out cycling behavior on the part of a subset
of market participants. With N>2, equilibria may exist in which firms with few loyal customers choose
cycling strategies while firms with more loyal customers choose strategies in which they play pi*.
8
Noel (2007) intuits this relationship and finds evidence consistent with station density increasing the
likelihood of behavior consistent with Edgeworth cycles.

9

be less likely to play higher-amplitude cycling strategies, in which a firm cuts price
significantly below pi* during the undercutting phase and sets substantially above pi*
when relenting. Higher amplitude strategies price less optimally for the loyal customers.
– thus, as the proportion of loyal customers increases, the lost-profit associated with
suboptimal pricing to loyal customers is more likely to outweigh the profit gained
through competing for the firm-switching customers. Furthermore, if a firm with a large
proportion of loyal customers participates in a cycling equilibrium with a firm that has a
smaller proportion of loyal customers, the former may be more likely to relent when
prices are low.
Our model’s predictions of cycle characteristics such as its amplitude are
consistent with empirical observations in Noel (2007a), which were unpredicted by
Eckert (2003). In markets with a large independent presence (markets in which βi tends
to be larger relative to αi), Noel finds that market cycles have greater amplitude. In
addition, he finds evidence that brand-name firms, which plausibly have a higher
proportion of loyal customers, are more likely to relent at the bottom of a price cycle.

Empirical Predictions

Since we examine average prices at the MSA and ZIP code levels, we translate
our predictions about station-level behavior up to what we expect to see at higher levels
of aggregation. Based on our model predictions, we first predict that areas with
independent stations and, especially independent stations with convenience stores, would
be most likely to exhibit cycling behavior. If customers have a preference for branded
gasoline, we also expect that cycling behavior would be more prominent in areas with

10

more than one branded station. A branded station may be less likely to suboptimally
price to consumers idiosyncratically preferring branded gasoline, absent a nearby branded
competitor.
Cycles at the city level would reflect coordination over a large number of stations.
We anticipate that this will be more likely in concentrated markets. In addition, as
concentration rises, branded firms may have less incentive to participate in cycles with
small market share independents. This suggests a relationship between concentration and
observable cycling behavior where the least and most concentrated markets are less likely
to cycle.

III. Data Description

The empirical analysis uses a dataset of daily gasoline prices across 115
metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) in the Midwest and Northeast U.S. from April 1,
2000 to March 31, 2001.9 These data were collected at the station level by the Wright
Express Financial Services Corporation, a leading provider of payment processing and
financial services to commercial and government car, van and truck fleets in the United
States. Their Oil Price Information Service (OPIS) provides pricing information to the
industry and transportation companies.
In addition to the retail price, OPIS data include a measure of each station’s
wholesale price. This is a rack price—the price at the terminal—from the nearest

9

Metropolitan areas include an urban core with a population of at least 50,000, as well as surrounding
counties tied economically through driving patterns—a definition well suited to studying gasoline markets.
The data include stations in the Midwest, where there was a large price spike in the Spring of 2000, as well
as eastern states as a comparison, including Arkansas, Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas,
Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New York, Ohio,
Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Washington, DC.

11

refinery that produces the regulatory formulation of gasoline used by the station. These
regional prices also vary by brand of gasoline, and the data include these brand-specific
wholesale prices. This wholesale price may differ from the internal transfer price paid by
refiner-owned stations. It may also differ from the station’s actual wholesale price in that
it does not include volume discounts or delivery charges.10
The OPIS data also include the street address of the station. US Census of
Population data at the ZIP code level in 2000 were matched to the stations, including
median household income, population, and commuting behavior. Race and educational
attainment measures were also collected. In addition, the 2000 US Census ZIP Code
Business Patterns database records the number of gasoline stations in each ZIP code.
One advantage of the OPIS data is that measurement error should be minimized,
as the prices are recorded electronically from their clients’ charge cards.11 A cost of
using credit card transactions is that they are only available for stations visited by a card
holder, which results in missing data especially on weekends. Over 33,000 stations are
found at least once over the year in our data, and theses stations provide a fairly accurate
measure of brand coverage in a city. When comparing stations in the pricing survey and
those in the Census Business Patterns data at the MSA level, then average number of
stations is 262 and 274, respectively. At a smaller scale, the median ZIP code had three
quarters of the stations surveyed.12

10

Volume discounts are common for branded gasoline at the wholesale level. Estimates with and without
controls for wholesale price are discussed below.
11
Further information on the methodology is available in Doyle and Samphantharak (2008) and at
http://opisnet.com/methodology.asp
12
To explore the types of ZIP codes that have better coverage in the pricing sample, the ZIP code count of
the number of stations in the sample was regressed on the observable characteristics in Table 1. The main
result is that more populous ZIP codes are associated with more station surveyed, controlling for the
number of stations in the Census data.

12

Edgeworth cycles are characterized by gradual downward price movements, as
firms marginally undercut competitors’ prices, followed by a price spike. To empirically
categorize geographic areas as cycling versus non-cycling, the median daily change in the
retail price is considered, as in Lewis (2007). In particular, the daily change in retail
price was calculated for each station with at least two consecutive days of data, and then
the median of this daily price change at the MSA or ZIP code level was calculated. In
cycling markets, we would expect the median price change to be negative, reflecting the
greater number of days of falling prices as opposed to the sudden jump in price in the
relenting phase. To ensure that the changes represent movements of a common set of
stations, only stations that were present for at least 200 days over the year were included
in these calculations, although the results were similar when all of the information was
used.
In practice, we found that OPIS data can characterize cycling behavior at the
MSA and ZIP code levels, but they are not precise enough to characterize cycling at the
station level. Furthermore, even in locations where cycling exists, it is difficult to
observe which station relents at the bottom of the cycle, as the change likely happens at a
higher frequency than our daily data can capture. Rather than estimate cycling behavior
at the station-level, we aggregate up to the MSA and ZIP code levels.
The two main measures of market structure are the fraction of stations that are
independent and measures of the brand concentration in the market. Independent stations
are not affiliated with a particular oil refiner, and they were identified in our sample by
investigating the brand name. The Society of Independent Gasoline Marketers of
America (SIGMA) publishes its member list, which provides one measure of whether the

13

brand was independent, and the remaining brands were investigated individually. We
further categorized independents based on the proportion of their retail outlets with an
attached convenience store, as reported in trade press, websites and regulatory filings. Of
the 45 independent brands observed in our data, twenty-six brands operate convenience
stores at more than half of their retail outlets.
In terms of the brands, one feature of gasoline markets is that some stations may
be owned by the refiner, while others are franchises. Unfortunately, the data do not allow
us to separate these two groups. Further, when we characterize brand shares, no quantity
data are available at the daily level. Instead, the fraction of stations in our sample of a
particular brand is used in calculating the 3-brand concentration ratio and the brand HHI.
Again, the station concentration of each brand appears fairly accurately measured, as the
number of stations ever surveyed in each area is similar to Census measures.

IV. Empirical Models and Results
A. Edgeworth Cycles across Cities

As mentioned, we calculate the median daily price change for each of our
geographic areas following Lewis (2008) and for ease of interpretation, we apply a cutoff
below which an area is classified as exhibiting cycling behavior. As a first look, we
ranked the MSAs in our sample by their median daily changes of average retail price.
Figure 1 shows the average retail and wholesale price over time in 4 cities: the city with
the smallest (i.e. largest negative) median change in retail price (Toledo, OH: median
change equal to $-0.0124), a city near the median of the daily price change distribution
(Detroit, MI: $-0.0014), and two cities city near the top of the ranking (Lincoln, NE, and

14

Johnstown, PA). In the top 3 graphs, a large price spike in the Spring of 2001 common to
stations in the Midwest dominates the first few months of the series. This spike was
partially due to a mandated reformulation and subsequent shortages (for more detail, see
Doyle and Samphantharak, 2008). Later in the summer and the rest of the year, some of
the cities in the Midwest reveal small decreases in price followed by sudden increases.
For Toledo, Detroit, and Lincoln, the wholesale price movements are nearly identical, but
the Toledo market has what appear to be Edgeworth cycles and the other two do not.
Johnstown does not have the spike in April 2000, nor does it exhibit cycling behavior. It
appears that the median price change measure reveals which cities tend to cycle. In
particular, cities with a median price decline of -0.005 or more appear to exhibit cycling
behavior, and this cutoff will be used in the analysis to compare cycling and non-cycling
cities.13
Table 1 compares the characteristics of the 20 cycling MSAs with the 95 noncycling MSAs in our sample The first row shows that this price change in the cycling
MSAs is negative—a median decline of 0.8 cents per day—whereas non-cycling MSAs
show median price change close to zero. The average retail and wholesale prices are
similar across the two groups, with retail prices during this time period close to $1.50 per
gallon. Much of the difference between retail and wholesale price is comprised of the
state and federal taxes on gasoline.
In terms of the fraction independent and brand HHI, the cycling and non-cycling
cities feature similar measures. This similarity masks a nonlinearity in the data that the
most (and least) concentrated markets are less likely to feature cycling. The fraction of

and a city with a median change in retail prices of -0.004.

15

stations that are independent with convenience store operations does appear positively
related to cycling in the raw means, with these types of stations making up 15% of
cycling-city stations and only 9% of stations in non-cycling cities.
When US Census characteristics are considered, non-cycling MSAs include the
largest cities and have higher average population density levels (1600 per square mile vs.
1400). Cycling cities also have more stations on average (271 vs. 255). The median
household income is slightly higher in the average cycling city as well ($41,400 vs.
$40,600).
Among the employed population, commuting patterns are similar across the two
groups. Most workers drive to work alone, with slightly higher rates in cycling cities (83
vs. 80%). Meanwhile, the cities are similar in terms of racial composition. Among
adults over the age of 25, the high school dropout rates are the same on average across
the two groups. The percent with college education is higher in the non-cycling MSAs
(23% vs. 21%). Overall, the cycling and non-cycling MSAs appear similar, with the noncycling MSAs including the largest cities.

Cycling & Brand Concentration

In the model, the price elasticity of customers varies by firm, with some firms
enjoying more brand loyalty or geographic advantage than others. One way that we
characterize the potential for brand loyalty is by comparing independent stations with the
refiner-affiliated brands such as Exxon or Citgo that invest more heavily in brand
identification. Further, the model suggests that in markets that are highly concentrated
the top firms will have less incentive to enter the cycle, and in highly competitive

16

markets, the tacit collusion necessary to support cycling may break down. As a first look
at these implications, Table 2 compares the cycling behavior across MSAs that vary by
their fraction of stations that are independent or their brand concentration levels.
Panel A groups MSAs into quartiles based on the fraction of independent stations.
The bottom quartile has 4% of stations that are independent on average, whereas the top
quartile averages 35% of stations that are not affiliated with an oil refiner. The
relationship between the fraction independent and cycling behavior has a marked inveseU shape: 31% of cities in the middle two quartiles exhibiting cycling, whereas few cities
in the bottom or top quartile are found to cycle. This result is in contrast with the
previous evidence that compared 19 cities in Canada and found that more independent
stations were associated with a higher likelihood of cycling behavior (Noel, 2007a).
Panel B shows that a greater proportion of stations that are independent does
appear to be related to cycling when those independents are also convenience store
operators. The bottom two quartiles of cities here do not exhibit cycling at all. For the
top two quartiles of cities based on the fraction of independent stations with convenience
store operations, 41% and 29% are found to cycle, respectively.
As the fraction of independent stations grows, this may represent a more
competitive market. To investigate the relationship between concentration and cycling
directly, Figure 2 considers the 1-brand concentration ratio and the 3-brand concentration
ratio. Local-linear regression estimates of the cycling indicator on these concentration
measures are reported. As the largest brand gets larger, the likelihood of cycling in the
city decreases. This is consistent with a reduced incentive by a dominant firm to engage
in an Edgeworth cycle. 3-brand concentration ratio shows a distinctive inverse-U shape

17

with regard to cycling. It appears that cycling is much less likely in cities with either a
high or low level of concentration.
Panel C of Table 2 further explores this relationship between concentration levels
and cycling in terms of HHI measured using the share of stations in the area (similar
results are found when the 3-brand concentration ratio is used instead). 14% of the
markets in the least concentrated MSAs and 11% of the most concentrated MSAs can be
categorized as cycling, compared to 31% in the 3rd quartile.14 These measures could be
related to the fraction of independent stations to the extent that large independent brands
are driving both measures. In practice, more independent stations are associated with less
concentrated markets.15
These raw comparisons do not take into account differences between the MSAs.
Table 1 showed that cycling and non-cycling MSAs are similar, but the relationship
between cycling and concentration may be affected by the demand characteristics in the
area. To test the relationship between cycling behavior and the fraction of independent
stations or brand concentration, controlling for the demographic characteristics of the
MSAs, the following model is estimated for MSA m:

Ym = γ 0 + γ 1 I m + γ 2 H m + γ 3 X m + ε m

(2)

where Ym is a measure of the cycling behavior of the MSA, either the cycling indicator or
the median daily change in the retail price; Im measures the fraction of independent
stations in the MSA; Hm is a vector of indicator variables equal to one if the MSA is in a
particular quartile of the HHI distribution and zero otherwise; Xm is a vector of the
14

Similarly, the 3 brand concentration ratio (not shown) increases from 0.27, 0.49, 0.57, and 0.70 from the
bottom to the top quartile, and the fraction of cities that cycle in each quartile is 13%, 18%, 29%, and 11%.
15
Pair-wise correlations between the fraction of independent stations vs. HHI and between the fraction of
independent stations vs. the top 3 brand concentration are -0.14 and -0.27, respectively.

MSA’s characteristics described in Table 1, including the demographic controls and the
median change in the wholesale price. The model is estimated with OLS to compare
conditional means, although the results for are similar when probit models are used to
estimate the model when the dependent variable is the cycle indicator.
Panel A of Table 3 reports the results when the indicator for cycling is the
dependent variable, and Panel B reports the results for the median change in daily
prices—the measure used to define the cycling indicator. This measure allows all of the
information in the daily change to be used in estimating the relationships, although the
relationships are similar in both Tables.
Column (1) shows a lack of a linear relationship between the fraction of stations
that are independent in a city and cycling behavior, whereas Column (2) shows that the
greater the proportion of stations that are independent with significant convenience store
operations increases, so does the likelihood of cycling. To consider the nonlinearity
shown in Table 2, Column (3) reports estimates from a model that includes indicators for
the quartiles of the fraction of stations that are independent. Here, the bottom quartile is
less likely to cycle compared to the top quartile, although the difference is not statistically
significant. As in Table 2, the middle two quartiles are where cycling behavior is found
most likely to occur. Column (4) shows that across cities that vary by their fraction of
stations that are independent with significant convenience store operations, the top two
quartiles are much more likely to cycle.16
Columns (5) shows that the areas most likely to cycle are those where the
concentration measure is in the 3rd quartile, confirming the unconditional results shown in

16

These results were robust to categorizing stations as independent if they were SIGMA members, as
opposed to the measure in the main results which involved investigating each brand name.

19

Table 2. Columns (6) and (7) include both the fraction independent measures and the
HHI quartile indicators, and both results are robust. In particular, the 3rd quartile in terms
of brand HHI is associated with a 22-25 percentage-point higher likelihood of cycling
compared to the most concentrated MSAs (s.e. = 0.11). With 17% of cities found to
cycle, this is a large difference.
In terms of the control variables, the demographic characteristics of the cities are
largely unrelated to cycling behavior (see Appendix). In particular, median daily changes
in our wholesale price measure are unrelated to cycling. The greater proportion of
workers who drive to work alone is (weakly) positively related to cycling behavior.
These results suggest that cycling behavior is less likely to occur in the most
competitive markets with the most independent stations—a situation when coordination
may be infeasible. Further, in the most concentrated markets, it may not be in the interest
of the dominant firms to enter the cycle. Rather, it is in the markets where the top 3
brands represent 50-60% of the market where we are seeing the cycling behavior most
pronounced.

Price Effects

One question that arises is whether cycles result in lower or higher average prices.
A complication is that cycling is related to the competitive nature of the market, which is
predicted to affect prices as well. To consider the relationship between cycling and
prices, controlling for market concentration, the following model is estimated for market
m:

Pm = γ 0 + γ 1C m + γ 2 I m + γ 3 H m + γ 4 X m + ε m

(3)

20

where Pm is the average retail price in the city, Cm is a cycling indicator, I and H are
measures of the market structure as above, and X is a vector of controls including the
average wholesale price in the market.
The results are reported in Table 4, and cycling is weakly related to lower prices.
A cycling city is found to have lower prices by 1 to 2 cents per gallon on average
(s.e.=0.01). It appears that the cycling cities have cycles that spend roughly equal time
above and below the price levels in non-cycling cities.
Controlling for cycling behavior, the fraction of independent stations is associated
with higher prices in the area, whereas the fraction of independent stations with c-store
operations is associated with lower prices. Meanwhile, HHI in the area is associated with
higher prices: cities in top quartile in terms of brand concentration have prices that
average approximately 5 cents per gallon. This result is robust to controls, with income
level and wholesale price positively related to the retail price (see Appendix). With
markups generally on the order of 5 cents per gallon in the Midwest (Brannon, 2003),
such a difference appears economically significant.

B. Edgeworth Cycles Within Cities

The “rockets and feathers” pattern of prices at the city-level suggests that
competition is at the city level as well. Otherwise, if stations competed in this way across
the street from one another and had different cycle frequencies, it would be difficult to
detect the cycles at the city level. Instead, we find the jump in prices occurs on the same
dates across cities. Given that MSAs are defined by commuting patterns, pricing
pressure is likely transmitted across the MSA. The original Maskin and Tirole model

21

evokes images of gasoline stations competing on a street corner, however, and we
investigate whether cycling can be characterized at a smaller unit of analysis: the ZIP
code level.
An advantage of investigating cycling behavior within cities is that we can control
for fixed characteristics of MSAs that are difficult to control but may be related to both
cycling behavior and market concentration, such as the regulatory environment. The
fixed effects also control for regional factors, as cycling is found in the Midwest and not
in the Northeast of the U.S. That said, store locations are chosen with future competition
in mind, and convenience store operators, for example, may select areas within cities that
are more prone to cycling behavior for reasons other than their pricing strategies.
To consider the source of Edgeworth cycles within and across cities, we
compared 5900 ZIP codes to describe the determinants of cycling at a smaller unit of
analysis. To identify ZIP codes that cycle there are two data issues. First, the ZIP code
data are more likely to suffer from missing data problems compared to measures of prices
at the city level. The main results include all of the ZIP codes in the data, but results are
similar when the data are restricted to ZIP codes with observations in at least 200 days
out of the year. Second, it is useful for ease of interpretation to categorize ZIP codes as
cycling or non-cycling, and we visually inspected the data to arrive at a median change in
retail price cutoff of -0.002.17 Again, the results are similar when we use the median
change in retail price itself rather than the dichotomous indicator for cycling, as well as
when the cutoff remained -0.005.
The empirical models for ZIP code z in MSA m take the following form:
17

The city analysis used a cutoff of -0.005. Appendix Figures A2A and A2B show the time series of retail
and wholesale prices for all ZIP codes that are categorized as cycling vs. those that are categorized as not
cycling using the -0.002 cutoff.

22

Y z = γ 0 + γ 1W z + γ 2 X z + δ m ( z ) + ε z

(4)

where Y is an indicator for cycling behavior or average price in the ZIP code and W is a
characteristic of the ZIP code of interest from the theoretical model, such as the presence
of an independent station with a convenience store or the presence of dominant firm. The
results are shown with and without controls for ZIP Code characteristics taken from the
US Census of Population in 2000, X, and with and without MSA fixed effects. The
models reported are estimated using OLS, although nearly identical results are found with
probit models. For comparability with the earlier results and the dependence of pricing
within a larger MSA market, the standard errors are clustered at the MSA level.
Table 5 reports the results for cycling behavior at the ZIP code level. Panel A
considers the presence of an independent station (either with or without major
convenience store operations), with the excluded category ZIP codes with no independent
stations. 38% of ZIP codes have an independent gasoline station, and 21% have a
convenience-store independent. Column (1) includes no control variables and the
presence of an independent gasoline station with significant convenience store operations
is a large predictor of cycling in the ZIP code. Compared to a mean of 13%, the presence
of at least one such station is associated with a 31 percentage point increase in the
likelihood of cycling (38% of ZIP codes with a convenience-store independent are found
to cycle compared to 6.5% of ZIP codes with no such station), and the result is robust to
the addition of controls. The presence of an independent without convenience store
operations is negatively related to cycling, although this result is less robust to the
inclusion of MSA fixed effects. Columns (3) and (4) report models with MSA fixed
effects, and the estimates are identified from differences in the independent store

23

locations within an MSA. The convenience-store results are generally similar when we
compare ZIP code cycling within cities.
Column (4) restricts the analysis to within city comparisons of ZIP code cycling,
conditional on the MSA cycling as defined earlier. We find that 42% of the stations in
our cycling cities are in ZIP codes that are also found to cycle. Again, having an
independent with convenience-store operations in the ZIP code is positively related to
ZIP code cycling within the city, with a similar coefficient of 0.31, but compared to a
different baseline of 43%. Independent stations without a convenience store are also
positively related to ZIP code cycling (coefficient of 0.12). In terms of covariates, the
median change in wholesale prices is not related to cycling, consistent with cycling being
a retail market phenomenon (see Appendix). Taken together, it appears that
convenience-store independents are associated with an increased likelihood that a city
cycles, and once a city cycles any independent station is associated with aggressive
pricing strategies.
Section 2 suggested that there should be a nonlinear relationship between brand
concentration and cycling, and this was found for the cross-city comparisons in Table 3.
Panel B of Table 5 further investigates this relationship by considering whether having
only one “top brand” in the ZIP code reduces the likelihood of cycling compared to
having two top brands. “Top brands” are defined as the two brands with the highest
station shares in the city. If only one top player is in the ZIP code, it may have a higher
fraction of loyal consumers who live or work nearby and they may eschew the costs of
engaging in Bertrand-style price movements. The results in Panel B report estimates
from models similar to Panel A, but with indicators that one or both of the top 2 brands in

24

the city are in the ZIP code, with the excluded category ZIP codes with neither of the top
2 brands. The results show that having both of the top 2 brands is a much stronger
positive relationship with cycling than having just one, consistent with the notion that it
takes at least two to play the game. This result is robust to controls, including MSA fixed
effects.18 These results provide compelling evidence that the observed cycles are indeed
a product of competitive forces among large players, as opposed to some (unobserved)
mechanical process that leads to price spikes.
The last set of results replicates the retail price results and are shown in Table 6.19
As in Table 4, cycling is associated with modest reductions in price (between 1 and 3
cents on average, compared to an average gas price at the time of $1.52). It appears that
cycling results in prices that are more volatile, but are similar to non-cycling cities on
average. Meanwhile, the presence of an independent gasoline station in the ZIP code, or
a top brand, is relatively unrelated to the average price in the ZIP code.

Limitations

The MSA results are cross-sectional relationships with the usual caveats that areas
with cycling behavior may simply differ compared to areas without cycling behavior.
The observable characteristics look similar across the groups, however, with the
exception that the largest cities do not appear to cycle. Results are similar when cities of

18

Other measures of brand overlap in a city were considered. Similar results are found when more than the
top 2 brands are considered, with the presence of only one of the top 3 or 5 brands being associated with
significantly less cycling behavior. Cycling by brand was also considered, although missing data
limitations make this type of comparison less compelling.
19
The number of observations is slightly different in Table 6 compared to Table 5 due to missing data for
the change in wholesale price in the set of controls used in Table 5. Results are nearly identical when this
variable is excluded and the same sample is used for both Tables.

25

greater than 2 million populations are excluded. Also, the results are similar when MSA
fixed effects are included.
Second, the data are limited by the frequency of missing observations, especially
for weekends. Aggregate city level data should categorize cities that cycle versus those
that do not. In addition, the results are similar when the sample is limited to stations that
are frequently seen in the data. In addition, it appears that our sample has sufficient
coverage over the course of the year to characterize brand concentration.
Another limitation is the lack of quantity data results in measures of concentration
at the station-share level rather than the usual market share for each brand. To the extent
that station shares reflect some minimum quantity before a franchise is allowed to open,
it seems likely that such station shares are sufficiently highly correlated with quantity
shares to serve as a reliable proxy for HHI. In any event, the station shares provide
slightly different measure of concentration, but one that reflects geographic coverage of
the brands.
Last, the cycling behavior is found in the Midwest, largely in Ohio, Michigan,
Indiana, and Illinois. The shape of the relationships described in the larger sample is
robust to limiting the sample to stations only in the Midwest, and we find that the cities in
the eastern U.S. provide a useful comparison group.20

V. Conclusion

Retail gasoline markets are unique in that the price for the product is broadcast for
all to see, including competitors. This facilitates price competition, and a striking feature

20

In our sample, Midwest states are Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri,
Nebraska, Ohio, and Wisconsin.

26

of these markets is that some exhibit what appear to be Edgeworth cycles. A refinement
to the Maskin-Tirole model that allows firms to retain some customers even when they
are underbid suggests that markets with dominant firms may not have the incentive to
enter such a cycle. Further, a necessary condition for such tacit collusion is that the firms
have some market power, and the least concentrated markets may not be able to support
such cycles either.
The empirical results use a dataset of daily prices across 115 cities to describe the
types of cities that exhibit cycling behavior. 17% of cities in our sample have price
cycles. In contrast to previous evidence, cities with more independent stations are found
less likely to cycle. When independent stations with significant convenience store
operations are considered, however, a greater proportion of such stations is related to
cycling. This relationship with convenience-store independents and cycling behavior is
found within cities as well, with ZIP codes with such stores much more likely to have
cycling. Given the complementary goods and the price salience of the gasoline price,
these stations may have an incentive to engage in price reductions that can lead to the
cycling behavior.
It appears that the main observable characteristics that characterize which
Midwestern cities exhibit Edgeworth cycles is the extent to which the market is
concentrated: the least and most concentrated cities are less likely to cycle. Meanwhile,
cycling behavior is not found to result in higher or lower retail prices. These results are
found controlling for city characteristics such as income levels, commuting patterns,
changes in wholesale prices, as well as models that included MSA fixed effects and
identified the relationships across ZIP codes in the same city.

Appendix
Proposition 1 Proof: Let {R1(p-1t), R2(p-2t),…, RN(p-Nt)} be a set of reaction functions

exhibiting cycling behavior and consider the derivative with respect to αi of firm i’s
expected profits earned by playing Ri(p-it) and by playing pi*. Since pi* maximizes
profits from the share of “loyal” customers, αi ,
⎡∞
⎤
∂E ⎢∑ δ t ( pi* − ci )α i q ( pi* )⎥
α
⎣t =0
⎦ > ∂Vit ( p− it ) .
∂α i
∂α i

(2)

Thus, a change in the share of loyal customers increases the profits associated with
playing pi* more than the profits associated with playing Ri(p-it).

Corollary 2 Proof: Let Ri(p-it) be a reaction function exhibiting cycling behavior and

consider a deviation from Ri(p-it) to a strategy in which the firm always plays pi*. Let
Vitα ( p − it ) and Vitβ ( p −it ) denote the expected profits from loyal customers and firmswitchers when firm i plays Ri(p-it).21 Define p̂i as the constant price which provides the
firm the same expected profits from loyal customers as the cycling equilibrium22. By
definition, p̂i solves
⎡∞
⎤
E ⎢∑ δ t ( pˆ i − ci )α i q( pˆ i )⎥ = Vitα ( p −it )
⎣ t =0
⎦

(3)

A firm will prefer to play pi* to Ri(p-it) if and only if
⎡∞
⎤
E ⎢∑ δ t ( pi* − ci )[α i + β i ( pi* , p −it )]q( pi* )⎥ ≥ Vitα ( p −it ) + Vitβ ( p −it )
⎣ t =0
⎦

21
22

(4)

For expositional purposes, we assume that γi=0 – we find an identical result allowing γi>0.
Note that p̂i is a function of both the vector of reaction functions as well as the vector of starting prices.

29

Consider αi, β i ∈ (0,1) satisfying

β i ( pi* − ci )q( pi* ) − ( pˆ i − ci )q( pˆ i )
=
αi
( pˆ i − ci )q( pˆ i )

(5)

Rearranging (4), we have

t =0

∑ δ t ( pi* − ci )α i q( pi* ) = ∑ δ t ( pˆ i − ci )α i q( pˆ i ) + ∑ δ t ( pˆ i − ci )β i q( pˆ i )

(6)

The left hand side of (6) is the expected profits earned from loyal consumers by a
firm playing pi* in all periods. The first term on the right hand side is equal to Vitα ( p −it )
and the second term in the right hand side is strictly greater than Vitβ ( p −it ) by definition
of β i . Thus, values of αi, β i satisfy condition (5) implying that firm i prefers to play pi*
to Ri(p-it).

Proposition 3 Proof: Consider a firm choosing between Ri(p-it) and pi*. By definition,

the derivative of profits associated with playing pi* and Ri(p-it) with respect to γi are
respectively,
⎡∞
⎤
E ⎢ ∑ δ t (α i + β i ( p i* , p − it )) ⎥
⎣ t =0
⎦

(7)

∂Witα ( p −it ) ∂Witβ ( p −it )

∂γ i
∂γ i

(8)

∂Witα ( p −it )
⎡∞
⎤
= E ⎢∑ δ t (α i )⎥ , the difference in the derivative of profits is
Noting that
∂γ i
⎣ t =0
⎦
given by the relative proportion of firm switching consumers obtained by pi* and Ri(p-it).
Since playing cycling strategy Ri(p-it) allows a firm to obtain a greater proportion of firmswitching customers than playing pi* , for which firm i receives βi(pi* , R-it(pi*)), an

30

increase in γi has a greater effect of firm profits when the firm plays a cycling strategy
than when the firm plays a non-cycling strategy.
