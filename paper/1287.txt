Asset Markets, Exchange Rates and the Balance of Payments

ABSTRACT

This paper, written as a chapter for a Handbook of International
Economics, reviews developments in the theory of international monetary
economics from the late 1960's through the early 1980's.

Following a review

of the operation of the monetary mechanism of balance of payments adjustment
in the context of the Mundell—Fleming model, the paper reviews the more modern
analysis of the dynamics of balance of payments adjustment under fixed exchange
rates and of exchange rate determination under flexible exchange rates.

Begin-

ning with a simple exposition of the monetary mechanism, the model is then
extended to incorporate sluggish wage and output adjustments, endogenous monetary
policy and sterilization operations, multiplicity of tradable and nontradable
goods, large countries, capital mobility and portfolio balance.

The review then

turns to an exposition of exchange rate theory, starting with the monetary ap-proach to exchange rate determination.

Issues discussed in this context include

purchasing power parities, nontraded goods, the real exchange rate, currency
substitution and the interaction between real and monetary factors in effecting
exchange rates.

The paper proceeds with a presentation of a more general frame-

work that views the question of exchange rate determination as part of the
general theory of the determination of asset prices, and which highlights the
unique role of expectations.

The general framework is then applied to charac-

terize the interaction between the balance of payments and the equilibrium real
exchange rate.

The paper concludes with a brief discussion of some empirical

issues of exchange rate analysis.

I ntroduc ti on

This chapter reviews developments in international monetary economics
from the late 1960's through the early 1980's.

Since the world remained on a

system of fixed exchange rates until 1973, most of the research in the earlier
part of this period focused on monetary relationships and macroeconomic
behavior of open economies under a system of fixed exchange rates.

An issue

of central importance in this research, including the extensive literature on
the "monetary approach to the balance of payments," was the economic determinants of the behavior of the balance of payments, especially, the
theoretical elaboration and empirical investigation of the dynamic mechanism
of balance of payments adjustment.

With the shift to a system of floating

exchange rates among major currencies in 1973, there was a corresponding shift
of research interests away from primary focus on the balance of payments and
to principal concern with the economic determinants of the behavior of
exchange rates.

The unifying theme in much of this research was the "asset

market approach to exchange rates" which emphasizes conditions for equilibrium
in the markets for stocks of assets, especially national monies, as the
proximate determinant of the behavior of exchange rates.
Three general features of the research surveyed in this chapter
distinguish it, in general emphasis and broad outline, from the earlier work
on international monetary economics surveyed in chapter 13 by Kenen.

First,

in the policy approach to open economy macroeconomics developed most extensively by Meade (1951), and extended by the important work of Mundell (1968c)
and

Fleming (1962), it is usually assumed that the level of national income

is controlled by government policy, and that maintenance of full employment
(or internal balance) is the paramount objective of economic policy.

In this

approach, the balance of payments is a "problem" because maintenance of

—2—

balance of payments equilibrium (or external balance) constrains the use of
macroeconomic policy for purposes of maintaining full employment.

This

problem can be satisfactorily resolved provided that governments have an
adequate number of independent and effective policy instruments.

More recent

research on macro—economics, for both closed and open economies, expresses far
less confidence in the ability of governments to systematically affect levels
of national income and consistently maintain full employment through policy
manipulation.

This view is reflected in the more recent research on

international monetary economics where the balance of payments and the
exchange rate are regarded as important in their own right, rather than as
subsidiary concerns of policy management.

Second, in much of the earlier work on international monetary economics,
policy actions and economic disturbances were assumed to have essentially
permanent effects on payments flows.

It was recognized, of course, that the

losses of foreign exchange reserves associated with official settlements
deficits would imply a declining domestic money supply, unless the monetary
effects of the reserve loss were sterilized by domestic credit expansion.

It

was also recognized that reserve losses sterilized by domestic credit
expansion could not go on forever because a government would ultimately run
out of reserves.

However, relatively little attention was paid to the dynamic

process that would operate if reserve losses (or gains) were allowed to affect
the money supply, or to the long run equilibrium that would be established if
this process were allowed to operate, or to the longer run consequences of
changes in supplies of securities necessarily associated with policies of
sterilizing reserve losses and gains.

In contrast, in the research surveyed

here, the dynamic interaction among asset stocks and payments flows is at the
center stage of the analysis.

—3—

Third, in earlier work on exchange rate theory, the condition for
equilibrium in the flow market for foreign exchange transactions (exports,
imports, and capital flows) was usually regarded as the proximate determinant
of the exchange rate.

In some analyses, expectations of future exchange rates

had an important influence on current exchange rates by affecting speculative
capital flows.

But, even in these analyses, expectations of future exchange

rates were usually determined exogenously or by some ad hoc expectations
mechanism.

Recent research on the theory of exchange rates, in contrast, has

focused more on the conditions for asset market equilibrium as the proximate
determinant of equilibrium exchange rates, and has usually regarded expectations of future exchange rates as a critical factor affecting the conditions
for equilibrium in the relevant asset markets.

Moreover, by adopting the

assumption of "rational expectations," many recent models of exchange rate
behavior have allowed for endogenous determination of expectations of future
exchange rates in a manner consistent with the structure of the economic
system, and have thereby permitted explicit analysis of the role of
information in forming and revising expectations critical to explaining the
behavior of exchange rates.

Differences between the research surveyed in this chapter and earlier
approaches to balance of payments analysis and exchange rate theory should
not, however, be overemphasized.

The theoretical models applied to balance of

payments analysis in the late 1960's and early 1970's incorporate the same
basic elements as earlier such models and, correspondingly, share many of the
same properties and implications.

This essential unity is emphasized in this

survey by beginning our discussion, in section 2, with a review of the
operation of the monetary mechanism of balance of payments adjustment in the
context of the Meade—Mundell—Fleming model of open economy macroeconomics,

we

then turn in section 3 to the more mordern analysis of the dynamics of balance
of

payments adjustment under fixed exchange rates beginning with a simple

exposition of the key elements of the monetary mechanism of balance of payments adjustment.

operations, multiplicity of tradable and nontradable goods,

with endogeneously determined terms of trade and, finally, capital

mobility and portfolio balance.
Section

4 deals with the theory of flexible exchange rates.

The

evolution of the international monetary system from a regime of pegged
exchange rates into a regime of flexible rates resulted in a renewed interest
in

the theory of exchange rate determination. Analogously to the charact-

eristics of the modern

rates,

theory of the

balance of payments under fixed exchange

the modern theory of exchange rate determination has shifted the

emphasis from the circular flow approach (that gained popularity with the
Keynesian revolution) to considerations of portfolio choice and stock equilibrium.

A consequence of this shift has been the development of the asset—

market approach to the determination of exchange rates.

Models which belong

to the general category of the asset—market approach differ in their emphasis
on the role of money and the other assets hut they all highlight the roles of
expectations and of stock equilibrium.

Our exposition of exchange—rate theory starts with a simple exposition of
the monetary approach to exchange—rate determination.

In this context we

highlight the roles of purchasing power parities, non-traded goods, the real
exchange rate, currency substitution, as well as the interaction between real
and monetary factors which determine the equilibriuiu.exchange rate.

We then

present a more general framework that views the question of exchange—rate

—5—

determination as part of the general theory of the determination of asset
prices.

The broader framework highlights the unique role of expectations.

The general framework is then used to characterize the interaction between the
balance of payments and the equilibrium real exchange rate.

This model shows

that the current exchange rate depends on the entire expected future time
paths of the relevant exogenous variables.

The section concludes with a brief

discussion of some empirical issues for exchange—rate analysis.

2.

The Mundell-Fleming Model

The key development in the area of balance of payments analysis in the
late 1960's and early 1970's was the theoretical elaboration and empirical
investigation of the dynamic mechanism of balance of payments adjustment.

The

essential idea of this dynamic mechanism, which dates back to Hume's discussion of the price—specie—flow-mechanism, is that changes in asset stocks
(especially the money supply) associated with payments imbalances alter the
instantaneous

equilibrium position of the economy over time and ultimately

drive it to a long run

and 1960's,

this dynamic

mechanism

of

of payments adjustment was either ignored or suppressed by assuming

that the domestic monetary authority sterilized the monetary effects of
foreign exchange reserve gains and loses.

However, at least in Mundell's

(1961) description of the international disequilibrium system, this dynamic
mechanism was explicitly introduced into the standard model that represented
the main line of development in this earlier literature.

As illustrated in fiqure 2.1, Mundell's analysis is based on the open
economy extension of the IS—LM model, frequently referred to as the Mundell—

A.

In the long run, therefore, the increase in the domestic

credit component of the money supply would be fully offset by an equal loss of
foreign exchange reserves, and the stimulative effect of the domestic credit
expansion on national income would only be temporary.

If the government

attempted to maintain national income at a level above its long run equilibrium level by sterilizing foreign exchange reserve losses through
offsetting domestic credit expansions, it could do so for a while, but
ultimately it would run out of reserves.

The impact effect of devaluation,

therefore, is to increase domestic income and the domestic interest rate and
to create a balance of payments surplus.

These impact effects of devaluation,

however, are not the permanent, long—run effects of devaluation.

When privately held financial assets are internationally mobile, this
analysis of the balance of payments adjustment mechanism needs to be modified
to take account of the effects of capital movements on reseve holdings and
national money supplies,

Thus, with perfect

capital mobility, the balance of payments adjustment process is not a gradual
process in which money supply gradually adjusts to reserve gains and losses
associated with trade imbalances, but rather an instantaneous adjustment
process in which the level of reserves adjusts immediately in response to
international capital movements.

The essential elements in this analysis of the mechanism of balance of
payments adjustment, including the analysis of the cumulative effects on the
balance of payments of changes in domestic credit or the exchange rate and of
the consequences of international capital mobility are also central in the
literature on balance of payments theory that developed during the late 1960's
and early 1970's.

In this literature, howe.ver, less reliance is placed on the

Keynesian assumptions of rigid domestic prices and demand determined output
levels as the relevant assumptions for balance of payments analysis, and more
attention is devoted to explicit modelling of the dynamics of the balance of
payments adjustment process.

The analysis in section 3 focuses on these

issues.

Since, by assumption, trade imbalances cannot be financed by private
capital flows or by changes in private holdings of foreign monies, they must
be financed by a flow of international reserves which the domestic central
bank is compelled to absorb or supply in order to maintain the fixed exchange
rate.

Immediately after this increase in fiat,

and, as illustrated in figure 3.1, there will be a

trade deficit corresponding to the nominal value of the induced excess of
domestic real expenditure over domestic real income.

From the figure it is

clear that the cumulative magnitude of nominal trade deficits during the
process of convergence back to

i

must equal the initial fiat increase in the

domestic money supply.5
Third, any change in the long run equilibrium level of domestic money
demand that is not offset by changes in the domestic assets component of the
money supply ultimately leads to corresponding change in the foreign exchange
reserve component of the money supply and to a corresponding cumulative
payments surplus (or deficit).

For example, suppose that economic growth

increases domestic real income from

If there are no changes in the other components of the money supply, then
relative to what would have happened in the absence of the increase in
domestic income, there must be net inflow of foreign exchange reserves and a
corresonding cumulative payments surplus equal to

Another example is a devaluation that raises the exchange rate,

then a devaluation will result in a more

and in a corresponding increase in foreign exchange reserves and cumulative

If the effect of the rise in the rate of interest is

then (when the system

of money demand and in a correspondingly smaller increase in foreign exchange

The reason why the long run

equilibrium level of money demand may not rise proportionately with the
increase in the exchange rate (as it does in some simple monetary models of
devaluation) is that the nominal stock of bonds,

This non—neutrality of

exchange rate changes disappears if domestic bonds are denominated in real
goods rather than in domestic money, or if private residents see through the
government budget constraint and regard government debt as completely and
perfectly offset by expected future tax liabilities.7

tn import tariff, in

contrast to a devaluation, generally has non—neutral effects because a tariff
alters relative commodity prices, in addition to affecting the general level
of domestic prices, and this alteration of relative prices may influence the
long run equilibrium level of real money balances.8
Fourth, the factors that influence the path of convergence of the money
supply toward long run equilibrium and hence the flow magnitude of payments
surpluses and deficits are to a large extent distinct from the factors that
influence the cumulative payments surplus or deficit that results from a
change in the long run equilibrium level of money demand or in the in the
components of the money supply other than foreign exchange reserves.

For

—17—

example, the speed of convergence to long run equilibrium and the magnitude of
the payments flow resulting from an increase in the fiat issue of the central
bank are determined by the slope of the

3/3(M/P) = — 3E/3(A/p)

—

curve in figure 3.1:

(E/9r).{

—

(L/a(A/P))

(3.14)

]

High responsiveness of desired spending to the real value of privately
held assets and to the interest rate, and low responsiveness of money demand
to these same variables all contribute to produce a high speed of convergence
to long run equilibrium and hence a rapid loss of foreign exchange reserves in
response to an increase in the fiat issue of the central bank.

In contrast,

the long—run, cumulative response of the balance of payments to an increase in
the fiat issue of the central bank does not depend on any of these properties
of the desired expenditure function and the money demand function, but only on
the property that a change in the fiat issue does not alter the long run
equilibrium level of money demand.

3.2

Extensions of the simple model
The preceding analysis of the monetary mechanism of balance of payments

adjustment for a small open economy employed a number of restrictive
assumptions that have been the focus of much of the criticism of the monetary
approach to the balance of payments.9

Some of the critics of the monetary

approach have argued that some of its simplifying assumptions lack realism.
Among the assumptions that were singled out were (i) the reliance on some form
of real balance effect, (ii) the assumption that commodity and factor prices
adjust instantaneously to clear commodity and factor markets and maintain full
employment, (iii) the assumption that central banks do not systematically
offset foreign exchange reserve flows through sterilization operations,
(iv) the assumption that all goods are internationally traded, (v) the small

—18—

country assumption that implies that the economy takes the relative prices of
all goods, or at least of all traded goods, as fixed by world conditions and
(vi) the neglect of international capital mobility in many of the simple
expositions of the monetary approach.
the simple model.

The next section presents extensions of

It is shown that these simplifying assumptions can be

relaxed without altering significantly the fundamental characteristics of the
monetary approach to the balance of payments.

3.2.1..The real balance effect
The model examined in the preceding section incorporates a "real balance
effect" through the assumption that desired real spending depends positively
on the real value of assets, which includes the real value of money
balances.

This real balance effect, however, is not necessary to deriving the

critical reduced form relationship

alternatively, the model of the preceding section could be modified so
that the only channel through which changes in
and

affect the trade balance

is through a special form of the real balance effect known as the

"hoarding function" [see Dornbusch (1973a, l973bH.

If there are no domestic

interest bearing securities (and financial capital is not internationally
mobile), all saving and dissaving must take the form of accumulation and
decumulation of money balances.

Under these conditions, it is plausible to

suppose that desired real saving, which equals the excess of domestic real

Since the trade

surplus (or deficit) must be financed by an inflow (or outflow) of foreign
exchange reserves, and since these reserve flows alter the domestic money
supply in the absence of offsetting changes in other assets of the central

bank, it follows that
M =

PT

The key point of this exercise is that the reduced form relationship

has the same critical properties as the reduced form

PT(M/P,

examined in the preceding section.

It

follows that the specification of a hoarding function yields all of the
essential features of the monetary mechanism of balance of payments adjustment
discussed in the preceding section.

But, neither this special form of the

assumption of a real balance effect, nor any other form of that assumption is
necessary to the derivation of the essential features of this adjustment
mechanism.

With this assumption about the labor

domestic output is

determined by an aggregate supply function,

Allowing for the endogenous determination of domestic output modifies the
reduced form relationship describing the rate of change of the domestic money
supply,

(3.18)

If the nominal wage rate is determined parametrically,

rather than

adjusted endogenously, the process of adjustment of the domestic money supply
through reserve flows toward its long run equilibrium level is exactly as
described in section 3.1.

Moreover, changes in the fiat issue of the central

bank, in private securities holdings, or in the long run equilibrium level of

The only significant modification

of previous results is with respect to the effects of a devaluation which
raises, proportionately, the domestic price level.

Previously, the long run

effect of devaluation on the stock of foreign reserves reflected the typical
proportional effect of a. rise in the price level on the long run equilibrium

level of money demand, supplemented by the effect of a reduction in the real
value of privatley held securities on the long run equilibrium level of money
demand.

Allowing for the endogenous determination of domestic output through

the function

yS(p/)

and assuming that nominal wages are given, increases

the effect of devaluation in expanding the stock of foreign exchange reserves
because it introduces an additional channel, an increase in domestic output,

—21 —

through which a devaluation increases the long run equilibrium level of money
demand.

If the nominal wage rate adjusts endogenously, modifications of the
analysis of section 3.1 are more substantial, but the essential features of
the monetary mechanism of balance of payments adjustment remain intact.
Abstracting from anticipated inflation and anticipated changes in produtivity
that would contribute a trend component to the rate of change of the nominal
wage rate, suppose that

The dynamic system that jointly determines the evolution of the domestic
money supply (resulting from reserve flows) and the adjustment of the domestic
nominal wage rate consists of the differential equations (3.18) and (3.19).
The behavior of this dynamic system (for given values of the parameters

Thus, the modifications of monetary mechanism of balance of

payments adjustment implied by simultaneous endogenous adjustment of the
domestic nominal wage rate do not affect the stability of this mechanism or
the conclusions concerning the long run, cumulative effects of disturbances to
the money supply or to the long run equilibrium level of money demand.
These modifications affect only the details of the behavior of the money
supply and the balance of payments along the path of convergence to long run
equilibrium.

In particular, in the analysis of section 3.1, convergence of

the domestic money supply to the long run equilibrium level of money demand
was always monotonic.

With endogenous adjustment of the domestic nominal wage

rate, however, the money supply need not converge monotonically to its long
run equilibrium value.

3.2.3

Endogenous monetary policy and sterilization

Sterilization is a form of endogenous monetary policy in which a central
bank offsets all or part of the changes in the money supply resulting from
foreign exchange reserve flows by countervailing changes of its non—reserve
assets.

A simple form of sterilization policy is described by the rule
J =

— •'S'R,

0 <

where the sterilization coefficient

•

1,

<

indicates

(3.21)

the fraction of foreign

exchange changes that the central bank offsets by varying its fiat issue, and
where the rate of change in the domestic currency value of foreign exchange
reserves,

S.i,

is determined by the nominal trade surplus,

P.T(M/P, B/P, Y).

This form of sterilization policy does not affect the long run
equilibrium level of money demand, but it does slow down the convergence of
the money supply to the long run equilibrium level.

Specifically, with the

sterilization policy (3.22), we have
=

s.i +

—

4)•s'

= (1

—

4)•P•(M/P,

B/P, Y)

(3.22)

This slowdown in the speed of convergence to long run equilibrium comes at the
expense of a greater cumulative change in foreign exchange reserves.

If the

initial divergence between the long run equilibrium level of money demand and
the actual domestic money supply is

M,

the cumulative change in foreign

exchange reserves in the process of convergence to long run equilibrium is
=

(M/s)/(1

).

(3.23)

and it is apparent that a policy of complete sterilization is not feasible.

—24—

If a central bank attempts to set
M and M

= 1,

then any small divergence between

will ultimately lead either to an infinite gain in foreign exchange

reserves or an infinite loss of such reserves.11

In addition to sterilization, it is possible to analyze other forms of
endogenous monetary policy.

One such policy might be directed at moderating

movements in the domestic interest rate.

If the only cause of interest rate

fluctuations, other than variations in the domestic money supply, were changes
in the long run equilibrium level of money demand, then such a monetary policy
might contribute to economic stability and reduce the need for variations in
foreign exchange reserves.

However, if fluctuations in interest rates were

caused by disturbances other than fluctuations in the long run equilibrium
level of money demand, then an interest rate stabilization rule for monetary
policy would probably exacerbate fluctuations in foreign exchange reserves and
might destabilize the economic system [see Frenkel and Mussa (1981)].

Nontraded goods

goods with relative prices determined in world markets is easily modified by

Since neither monies nor securities are assumed to be internationally
traded among private agents, trade imbalances occuring at any instantaneous
equilibrium must be financed by a net flow of official foreign exchange
reserves.

Assuming no sterilization of the effects of such reserve flows on

the domestic money supply, the rate of change of the domestic nominal money
supply occuring at any instantaneous equilibrium is given by
M =

Comparison of the lower panel of figure 3.3 with figure 3.1 and
comparison of the condition (3.41) with the condition (3.12) reveals the close
analogy between the monetary mechanism of balance of payments adjustment that
operates with nontraded goods and the mechanism that opetates when all goods
are traded, and between the condition that determines the long run equilibrium
level of money demand with nontraded goods and the condition that is relevant
when all goods are traded.

Momentary reflection reveals that the four general

features of the monetary mechanism of balance of payments adjustment that were

discussed in section 3.1, as well as many of the specific conclusions of that
earlier analysis, carry over to the case where we have nontraded goods.
The major innovations resulting from the introdution of nontraded goods
are that we allow for variations in the relative price of nontradable goods

—30—

and in the general domestic price level along the path of convergence to long
run equilibrium.

As is apparent from the upper panel of figure 3.3, if the

domestic money supply is initially less than

point on the Nd = NS curve are less than their respective long run equilibrium
values,

The general domestic price level, P, which is an index

of the nominal prices of traded and nontraded goods will also be less than its
long run equilibrium value.

As the domestic money supply rises due to reserve

inflows resulting from trade surpluses, the instantaneous equilibrium position
of the economy moves up along the Nd = NS curve toward the long run
equilibrium point, implying an increase in the relative and nominal price
level as the economy converges to long run equilibrium.
occurs if the initial money supply exceeds

M.

The opposite process

It follows immediately that an

increase in the fiat issue of the central bank, starting from

M = M,

would

have the initial effect of raising the relative and nominal price of nontraded
goods and the general domestic price level above their long run equilibrium
values, and this would be followed by a period of adjustment during which the
domestic money supply and these prices all returned to their respective long
run equilibrium levels,

Starting from an initial position of long run

equilibrium, a devaluation would immediately result in an equiproportional
increase in the domestic nominal price of traded goods and would increase (not
necessarily proportionately) the long run equilibrium value of the domestic
nominal money supply.

The nominal price of nontraded goods, however, would

not rise immediately in proportion with the devaluation nor will it rise to
its new long run equilibrium level.

The relative and nominal price of

nontraded goods and the general domestic price level immediately following
devaluation would all be below their new long run equilibrium values and would

—31—

only gradually rise to these values as the domestic money supply rises to its
new long run equilibrium level.14
When we consider the effects of growth in an economy with nontraded
goods, the modifications of the earlier analysis are more substantial.

With

only a composite traded good, the long run, cumulative effect of growth in
domestic output and income depended only on the effect of an increase in
income on the demand for domestic money.

With nontraded as well as traded

goods, growth can affect the long run equilibrium level of money demand both
through the usual effect of an increase in income and through the effect of
changes in the long run equilibrium relative price of nontraded goods.

For

exampe, if the growth of domestic output (at constant relative prices) is
biased toward traded goods, relative to the growth of domestic demand, then
the long run equilibrium relative price of nontraded goods will have to rise
as growth occurs.15

With the domestic nominal price of traded goods fixed by

the exchange rate and by the given world prices of such goods, the increase in
the long run equilibrium relative price of nontraded goods requires an
increase in the domestic nominal price of such goods and, hence, in the
general price index. This increase in the general price index enhances the
effect of growth in expanding the long run demand for domestic money and,
thereby, increases the cumulative payments surplus resulting from growth.

The

opposite holds if growth is biased towards the production of nontraded
goods.

It is still true, however, that the cumulative effect of growth on the

balance of payments reflects the effects of growth on the long run equilibrium
level of money demand.

With nontraded goods, there simply are more channels

through which growth can effect the long run equilibrium level of money
demand.

Large countries

When the home country is not small relative to the rest of the world, it
is necessary to modify the preceding analysis to account for the interaction
between the home country and the rest of the world in determining the prices
of tradable goods and the distribution of the world stock of foreign exchange
To illustrate these modifications, it is useful to assume that the

economic structure of the home country and the foreign country (identified
with the rest of the world) is described by the model in the preceding

is, if and only if at constant nominal prices of the traded good, the

effect of an increase in the domestic real money supply on excess demand for
traded goods in the home country is larger than the effect of an equivalent

reduction inthe foreign money supply on the excess supply of traded goods in
the foreign country.

If so, then at the old nominal prices of traded goods

and the new distribution of the world money supply, there will be an excess
world demand of traded goods, and the nominal prices of traded goods will have
to rise in both countries (reducing the real values of money and bond
holdings) in order to restore equilibrium to the world market for traded
goods.

While the monetary mechanism of balance of payments adjustment is more
complicated for the two country world than for the small country, the basic
elements of this mechanism are essentially the same.

starting from a

situation in which the domestic nominal money suply is below its long run
equilibrium level and, correspondingly, the foreign money supply is above its
long rim equilibrium level, reserve flows associated with trade imbalances
gradually move the economic system to long run equilibrium by raising the

—35—

domestic money supply and reducing the foreign money supply to their
respective long run equilibrium levels.

As in the case of the small country,

the essential ingredient underlying this adjustment process is the
relationship through which a deficiency in a country's money supply relative
to its long run equilibrium level leads to an excess of domestic income over
domestic expenditure which implies a trade surplus which brings an inflow of
foreign exchange reseves and a gradual restoration of money balances to their
long run equilibrium level.
In the two country world, it remains true that a given initial divergence

of a country's money supply (and a corresponding divergence with the opposite
sign for the other country) will ultimately lead to a cumulative payments

surplus and change in reserves just equal to this initial divergence (assuming
there is no change in the non—reserve assets of central banks).

The long run

cumulative effect of disturbances that affect money supplies and money
demands, however, are somewhat different in the two country world than they
are for a small country.

For example, in the small country case, an increase

in the fiat issue of the central bank does not alter the long run equilibrium
level of domestic money demand and, hence, ultimately leads to an equal loss
of foreign exchange reserves.

In the large country case, an increase in the

fiat issue of the home country increases the world money supply and thereby
increases the long run equilibrium level of the nominal price of traded goods
in both countries.

This increase in the nominal price of traded goods implies

an increase in the long run equilibrium level of nominal money demand in both

countries, and hence a loss of foreign exchange reserves by the home country
that is smaller than the increase in the fiat issue of its central bank.
Similar reasoning leads to the conclusion that a devaluation by the home

country raises the long run nominal price of traded goods in that country

—36—

while reducing the long run nominal price of traded goods in the foreign
country.

Because part of the effect of devaluation is absorbed by a decline

in the foreign price level, the long run nominal demand for domestic money
rises less as a consequence of devaluation than it would if the home country
were small.

Correspondingly, the cumulative gain in foreign exchange reserves

for the home country due to devaluation is less than it would be if the
country were small [see Dornbusch (1973b)].

Note, however, that these

modifications of the small country results do not alter the basic principle
that the cumulative effect of any disturbance on a country's balance of
payments is equal to the effect of the disturbance on the divergence between
the domestic money supply and the long run equilibrium level of domestic money
demand.

When two large countries produce and consume only a single traded good,
in addition to their own nontraded goods, the stability of the mechanism of
balance of payments adjustment is not critically affected by the relative
price elasticities of demand or of excess demand for tradable or nontradable
goods.

These elasticities do influence the extent of variations in the

relative price of nontradables as we move along the path of convergence to
long run equilibrium, and they do affect the speed of convergence to long run
equilibrium.

But, low price elasticities of demand do not introduce the

possibility of instability in the mechanism of balance of payments
adjustment.

The reason for this is that the price elasticity that is critical

for the stability of this mechanism is the elasticity of demand for imports of
tradables into a country with respect to the relative price of tradables
between the two countries.

The assumption that tradable goods for the two

countries are perfect substitutes implies that this elasticity is infinite,
and this removes any possibility of instability.

—37—

When large countries exchange two or more tradable goods, elasticities of
import demands for these countries are important for the stability of the
monetary mechanism of balance of payments adjustment.

In the standard two—

country, two—commodity model of the pure theory of international trade, it is
well known that the Marshall—Lerner condition (the requirement that the sum of
the absolute values of the import demand elasticities of the two countries be
greater than one) is the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence
of a unique equilibrium relative price of the two commodities [see Johnson
(1956)J.

In the monetary extension of this model, in which money supplies,

bond supplies and interest rates affect only the level of spending in each
country but not its distribution among commodities, the Marshall—Lerner
condition becomes the condition for a unique long run equilibrium in which the
trade balance of each country is zero and there is no ongoing redistribution
of the world money supply.

If for each distribution of the world money

supply, the instantaneous equilibrium position of the world economy is unique,
it may be shown that the monetary mechanism of balance of payments adjustment

ultimately

drives

the world economy to this unique long run equilibrium.

Along the path of convergence to this long run equilibrium, spending differs
from income by equal and opposite amounts in the two countries, implying equal

and opposite trade imbalances and an ongoing redistribution of the world money
supply through flows of foreign exchange reserves.

The adjustment of the

relative commodity price along the path of convergence to long run equilibrium
is determined by application of the standard transfer problem analysis to the
endogenously determined magnitude of the transfer corresponding to the trade
imbalances of the two countries [see Dornbusch (1973a)].
If equilibrium is not unique in the standard two—country, two commodity
trade model, long run equilibrium

will not be unique in the monetary extension

—38—

of this model.

Corresponding to each real equilibrium, there will he

a

If for each distribution of the world

money supply, there is a unique instantaneous equilibrium in the monetary
model, the monetary mechanism of balance of payments adjustment will still be
well—defined:

That is, there will be a well—defined differential equation

that expresses the rate of change of the distribution of the world money
supply as a function of that distribution.

Moreover, it may be shown (not

without some difficulty) that the stable nodes of this differential equation
describing the monetary mechanism of balance of payments adjustment will
correspond to the real trade equilibria at which the Marshall-Lerner condition
is satisfied, and that the unstable nodes of this differential equation will
correspond to the real trade equilibria where the Marshall-Lerner condition is
not satisfied.

Thus, as suggested by many earlier writers, sufficiently large

elasticities of import demand are essential for stability of the mechanism of
balance of payments adjustment.

Capital mobility
Two important modifications of the preceding analysis of the monetary

mechanism of balance of payments adjustment are required when we allow for
international mobility of privately held financial assets.

First, the

official settlements balance is no longer equal to trade balance but to the
sum of the current account balance (which is the trade balance plus the flow
of interest income that domestic residents earn on their net foreign
securities holdings) and the capital account balance (which measures net sales
of privately held financial assets by domestic residents to foreign

The possibility of asset swaps does not alter the principle

that the current account balance is a flow magnitude, but, it does introduce
the possibility of stock unit changes in a country's international reserves
resulting from private attempts to swap domestic money for financial
securities 16

The implications of capital mobility for the monetary mechanism of
balance of payments adjustment are most easily illustrated by returning to the
case of a small open economy that produces and consumes only traded goods.
The model presented in section 3.1 is modified by assuming that securities
held by domestic residents, B, are perfect substitutes for securities issued
in the rest of the world, and that the domestic interest rate,

Achievement of such an instantaneous equilibrium

between the demand for domestic money and the existing supply requires a stock
unit change in the central bank's holdings of international reserves as
private asset holders buy or sell securities in order to achieve the desired
composition of their assets between money and securities.

Second, the process

of adjustment of the stock of privately held assets that occurs as a
counterpart of current account imbalances, as illustrated in the middle panel
of figure 3.5, is necessarily a gradual adjustment process in which the flow
or net saving determined by the excess of domestic income over domestic
expenditure accumulates over time into changes in the stock of privately held
assets.

Third, as illustrated in the bottom panel of figure 3.5, changes in

the stock of privately held assets resulting from current account imbalances
cause gradual changes in the instantaneous equilibrium level of money balances

and corresponding flows of foreign exchange reserves which are registered as
official settlements surpluses or deficits.
adjustment

This mechanism of monetary

is similar to the monetary mechanism of balance of payments

adjustment that operates in the absence of international capital mobility.

In

the present case however, reserve changes also occur in response to asset

swaps motivated by the desire of domestic residents to adjust the actual level
of

iiney balances within their portfolio of assets to its desired level.

Through reserve changes brought about by the operation of these two
mechanisms, the level of the domestic money supply is ultimately adjusted to

—42—

the

long run equilibrium level of domestic money demand that is associated

with the long run equilibrium level of privately held domestic assets and with
long run equilibrium of the current account balance.

These three principles all come into operation when we consider an

increase J in the fiat issue of the domestic central bank.

Starting from

an initial situation of long run equilibrium, domestic real assets exceed
their long run equilibrium value by the amount

3.5, corresponding losses of foreign exchange reserves by the central bank.
The total loss of reserves that results from this adjustment process, together
with the initial swap of domestic money for foreign securities, exactly
offsets the increase in the fiat issue of the central bank and restores
domestic money balances to their long run equilibrium level (see Frenkel and
Rodriguez (1 975)].

The general features of this analysis extend to the effects of other
types of disturbances.

If the disturbance creates an incipient divergence

between the actual level of money balances and their new instantaneous
equilibrium level, there will be a swap of domestic money for foreign
securities and a corresponding stock unit change in the central bank's
holdings of international reserves.

If after this asset swap the actual level

of domestic privately held assets differs from the long run equilibrium level,
there will be a gradual process of adjustment of asset holdings through
current account imbalances toward their long run equilibrium level.
Associated with these changes in the level of assets, there will be changes in
the instantaneous equilibrium level of money balances which will induce
changes in the central bank's holdings of foreign exchange reserves.

The

total change in reseves will equal the divergence that the initiating
disturbance creates between the long run equilibrium level of domestic money
balances and the actual level of such balances.

The introduction of nontraded goods modifies the analysis of mechanism of
balance of payments adjustment with international capital mobility in
essentially the same way as it modifies the analysis of this mechanism for the
case in which capital is immobile.

—44—

equilibrium levels.

As

A/P

rises due to current account surpluses, all of

these prices rise toward their respective long run equilibrium levels.
A modification that is in the same spirit as the introduction of
nontraded goods is the introduction of a nontradable asset that domestic
residents hold in addition to domestic money, and internationally tradable
securities.

The rate of return and the price of this nontradable asset is

determined by the requirement for equilibrium in the domestic market for this
asset, in much the same way that the relative price of a nontradable good is
determined by the requirement for equilibrium in the domestic market for such
a good.

starting from an initial valQe of

that is less than its long

A/P

run equilibrium value and assuming that asset demands are normal (in the sense
that an increase in

A/P

increases the real demands for all assets), the

instantaneous equilibrium price of the nontraded asset will be lower and the
instantaneous equilibrium rate of return on this asset will be higher than
their respective long run equilibrium values.

As

A/P

rises due to current

account surpluses, the price of the nontraded asset will rise, and the rate of
return on the nontraded asset will fall toward their respective long run
equilibrium values [see Dornbusch (1975) and Branson (1976); on the policy
implications see Frenkel and Mussa (1981)].

This analysis can be extended to the case of two large countries that
trade a single good and exchange a single internationally mobile security.

The results of this analysis are similar to those in section 3.2.5, modified
to reflect the implications of capital mobility.

Prices of nontraded goods

and yields on nontraded assets adjust to clear domestic markets for these
goods and assets in each country, conditional on the world price of the
tradable good, the world yield on the mobile security, and the prevailing
distribution of world wealth.

Instantaneous equilibrium requires that the

—45—

world price of tradable goods and the world yield on the mobile security clear
the world markets for these goods and securities, conditional on the
distribution of world wealth.

At such an instantaneous equilibrium, one

country will generally spend more than its income and the other country will
spend an equal amount less than its income, implying a corresponding current
account deficit and current account surplus.

The country with the surplus

will be increasing its share of world wealth at the expense of the country
with the deficit.

The redistribution of world wealth that finances the trade

imbalances will be accomplished partly by a flow of privately held securities
and partly by a flow of official reserves (with effects on the money supplies
of the two countries).

If the balance of payments adjustment process is

stable, as it should b€ in such a world, current account imbalances between
the two countries will gradually decline as the wealth of the surplus country
rises and the wealth of the deficit country declines, and the world will
converge to a long run equilibrium in which current account balances are zero
and there is no further redistribution of world wealth [see Frenkel (1976b)].
in this type of model of the world economy, an increase in the fiat issue
of the central bank of the home country results in an immediate loss of
foreign exchange reserves as domestic asset owners rebalance their portfolios
between money and securities.

Foreign residents will accommodate this

portfolio shift because the increase in the world price of traded goods and
the adjustment of the world yield on internationally mobile securities induces
them to swap securities for money.

At the instantaneous equilibrium

established immediately after the increase in the fiat issue of the home
country's central bank, the wealth of home residents has risen and that of
foreign residents has declined because the entire increase in the world money
supply went initially to home residents while the increase in the world price

—46—

level reduced the real value of the nominal assets of residents of both
countries.

During the process of adjustment subsequent to the establishment

of this instantaneous equilibrium, the wealth of home residents will decline
as they spend in excess of their income, and the wealth of foreign residents
will rise as they spend less than their income.

The central bank of the home

country will suffer a further loss of foreign exchange reserves because the
demand for money by home residents will decline along with their wealth.

In

the end, however, the total loss of foreign exchange reserve by the home
central bank (both from the initial asset swap and from subsequent reserve
flows) will be smaller than the increase in the fiat issue of this central
bank.

As in the case of no private capital mobility (section 3.2.5

),

this

is

because the increase in the fiat issue of the home central bank has increased
the world money supply, the long run equilibrium level of all nominal prices
and, hence, the long run equilibrium level of the demand for domestic money.
An increase in the money supply of the home country brought about by an
open market operation has somewhat different effects than an increase in the
fiat issue of the home central bank because the open market operation affects
the supplies of securities available to private asset holders.

Moreover, the

effects of such an open market operation depend on whether the securities
purchased by the central bank are domestic nontradable securities or
internationally tradable securities,

Tinder standard assumptions about

substitutability among assets in private portfolio demands, a purchase of
domestic nontradable securities will decrease the long run equilibrium yield
on such securities both absolutely and relative to the yield on
internationally mobile securities;

whereas an open market purchase of the

internationally mobile security will have a smaller effect in reducing the
long run equilibrium yield on this security and will reduce this yield

—47-.

relative to the yield on the domestic nontradable security.

effect of these two policies on the long run equilibrium world price level and
on the distribution of international reserves depends on the degrees of
substitution between national monies and different classes of securities
[see Dornbusch (1975, 1977)].

Substitution relations among assets in portfolio demands are crucial in
large countries models with two or more internationally tradable securities.
Since the analysis of such models is provided by Branson and Henderson in
Chapter 15 of this volume along with an extended list of references, we
conclude the present section by only highlighting one critical feature of
these models——the effects of sterilized intervention in the foreign exchange
market.

If the central bank of the home country intervenes in the foreign

exchange market by selling foreign securities in order to prevent depreciation
of the foreign exchange value of domestic money and sterilizes the monetary
effect of this intervention by buying domestic securities, the overall effect
of the operation will be to increase the outstanding supply of foreign
securities and decrease the outstanding supply of domestic securities while
holding the money supply constant.

Given standard assumptions about portfolio

demands for different securities, this alteration of security supplies will
increase the equilibrium yield on foreign securities and decrease the
equilibrium yield on domestic securities.

If each country's security is a

closer substitute for its money than the security of the other country,

then

this alternation in yields will decrease the demand for home money and
increase the demand for foreign money and, thereby, tends to alleviate the
monetary disequilibrium that was the cause of the drain of foreign exchange
reserves.

(raises e).8

This dependence of the current exchange rate on expectations

concerning the future (as summarized by the forward premium) is a typical
characteristic of price determination in asset markets.

Thus, an expected

future depreciation of the currency is reflected immediately in the current
value of the currency.

In the above model we have not drawn the distinction between "the demand
for domestic money" and "the domestic demand for money."

Implicitly it has

been assumed that domestic money is demanded only by domestic residents while
foreign money is demanded only by foreign residents.

Furthermore, the

formulation of the demands for real cash balances [in equations (4.8)—(4.9)]

included the domestic interest rate in the domestic demand, and the foreign
interest rate in the foreign demand; it has been implicitly assumed that the
only relevant alternative for holding domestic money is domestic securities
while the only relevant alternative for holding foreign money is foreign
securities.

In principle, however, the alternatives to holding domestic money

include domestic securities, foreign securities, inventories of domestic and
foreign goods as well as foreign exchange.

It follows that a richer

—51 —

formulation of the demand for money would recognize that, as an analytical

matter, the spectrum of alternative assets and rates of return that are
relevant

Furthermore, to the extent that under flexible exchange rate system
individuals might wish to diversify their currency holdings, the demand for
domestic money would include a foreign component which depends on foreiqri

income, while the demand for foreign money would include a domestic component
which depends on domestic income.19

These characteristics reflect the

predictiOns of the effects of parametric changes in incomes or rates of

the relative degrees of substitutions among assets in portfolios.

The general

principles which govern the effects of parametric changes on the relative
demands for money are similar to those that govern the effects of inter—
national transfers on relative demands and resemble the "transfer problem
criteria".

ceteris paribus, a rise in the tariff rate raises the price level, induces a
rise in the demand for nominal balances and results in a rise in the relative
price of nominal balances.

The monetary approach also provides for a

mechanism by which a tariff may result in a depreciation of the currency.

If

subsequent increases in tariffs result in distortions which lower real
income,the reduced real income reduces the demand for money and may outweigh
the effect of the rise in the price level.

In that case a rise in the tariff

rate may weaken the currency [for further discussion see Kimbrough (1980)].

therefore, depending on whether this reduction in the price level exceeds or

the exchange rate will fall or rise.

with the predictions of the "simple absorption" approach one may not conclude
unambiguously that a rise in aggregate spending weakens the currency.

the exchange rate effect may depend on whether the rise in spending falls on

The model can be extended to allow for capital mobility.

In that

The qualitative conclusions of the analysis remain unchanged

except for the fact that the induced change in the rate of interest (and
thereby the required change in the price level) would be smaller the higher

once and for all rise in the exchange rate and in the nominal price of non—
traded goods while leaving all real variables (like real balances, relative
prices, and the rate of interest) unchanged.

Likewise, a once and for all

equal rise in the domestic and the foreign money raises all nominal prices
while leaving all real variables and the exchange rate unchanged.
The formulation in equation (4.9)—(4.1O) presumed that money market
equilibrium obtains continuously.

The analytical framework could be modified

easily to allow for a distinction between short—run and long—run demands for
money.

This formulation would imply the dynamics of adjustment.

Likewise,

the formulation in equation (4.16) could be modified to allow for a gradual
adjustment to purchasing power parities [see Bilson (1978a).

While such

modifications of the theoretical model do not introduce severe complexities,
the implications for empirical estimates are much more involved and great care
is required in the specification of the corresponding econometric model.

Further modifications of the model allow for legal restrictions on
transactions in foreign currency which results in black markets, (Blejer
(1978)1, as well as for government intervention in the determination of
exchange rates which results in a crawling peg [Blejer and Leiderman
(1981)].

An additional modification concerns the choice of the rate of

interest that is included in the demand for money.

The formulation that we

have used included the nominal rate of interest as an argument without drawing
a distinction between the real interest rate and inflationary expectations.
Likewise, the specification assumed some form of purchasing power parities.
This specification can be modified so as to allow for short term price
stickiness.24

In that case a rise in the quantity of money lowers the real

rate of interest for the short—run and induces a depreciation of the currency.

The discussion of currency substitution suggested the possibility that
the function characterizing the demand for money includes many alternative

—57—

rates of return corresponding to the many alternative assets.

Again, as a

theoretical matter this modification does not introduce severe complexities
but the implications for empirical research may be severe since the various
rates of return may be highly collinear.

The degree of collinearity maybe

very high if the alternative rates of return are linked to each other by
various parity conditions.

Among such parity conditions are the interest

parity——linking the forward premium on foreign exchange to the difference
between domestic and foreign rates of interest, the purchasing power parity——
linking domestic and foreign prices, and the Fisher relations-—linking the
nominal rates of interest to the real rates of interest and to inflationary
expectations.

The analysis of exchange rate determination within the monetary framework
did not put much explicit emphasis on the stocks of other assets.

According

to the monetary model changes in the stocks of alternative assets results in
exchange rate changes only to the extent that they alter the various rates of
return which affect the demand for money.

In contrast, the portfolio—balance

model emphasizes the limited degree substitutability among alternative
assets.

According to the portfolio—balance model the relative quantities of

the various assets and of the rate of accumulation of these assets excert
profound first order effects on the exchange rate.25

As an empirical matter,

however, the implementation of this approach is made difficult due to limited
availability of data on the various quantities of the assets that would be
relevant for inclusion in the world portfolio model.

Since the rate of accumulation of assets equals the current account of
the balance of payments, it provides for a dynamic linkage between the current
account and the exchange rate.

As a result, analyses of the portfolio—balance

model have typically linked the exchange rate to the current account.26

It is

—58—

relevant to note, however, that such a linkage is not specific to the
portfolio—balance model.

Rather, it reflects the implications of the budget

constraint by which the current account of the balance of payments equals the
discrepancy between income and spending, and this constraint holds of course
independent of the determinants of portfolio composition.

Consequently, any

model which allows for net savings, must imply a relationship between the
exchange rate and the current account.27
Prior to concluding this section it might be useful to note that the
monetary approach to the •exchange rate does not claim that the exchange rate

is "determined" only in the money or in the asset—markets and that only stock
rather than flow considerations are relevant for determining the equilibrium
exchange rate.

Obviously, general equilibrium relationships which are

relevant for the determination of exchange rates include both stock and flow
variables.28

In this respect, the money market equilibrium relationship that

has been used, may be viewed as a reduced form relationship.

Furthermore, the

fact that the analysis of the exchange rate has been carried out in terms of
the supplies and the demands for monies, does not imply that "only money
matters" or that the exchange rate is determined only by the supply of
domestic and foreign monies:

on the contrary, in addition to the key role

played by the intersectoral relative price structure, the demand for money
plays a critical role and it depends on real variables like real income as
well as on other real variables which underlie expectations.

The rationale

for concentrating on the relative supplies and demands for money is that they
provide a convenient and a natural framework for organizing thoughts
concerning the determinants of the relative price of monies.

It is the same

principle which has been used by proponents of the monetary approach to the
balance of payments in justifying the use of the money demand-money supply

—59—

framework for the analysis of the money account of the balance of payments
under a pegged exchange rate system.29
The model that was discussed in this section included anticipatory
variables, like the forward premium on foreign exchange, as one of the
determinants of the current exchange rate.

However, this formulation has not

emphasized sufficiently the critical role that expectations play in affecting
the exchange rate.

This unique role is best exemplified within a more general

framework that views the question of exchange rate determination as part of
the more general theory of the determination of asset prices.

4.2.

Exchange rates as asset prices

In the models of exchange rate determination examined in the preceding
section, the dynamic behavior of the exchange rate is usually analyzed in
terms of the response of the exchange rate to an exogenous disturbance (such
as a permanent increase in the domestic money supply) and its subsequent path
of convergence to its new long—run equilibrium.

This general view of exchange

rate determination, however, does not fully explain key empirical regularities
that have been characteristic of the behavior of exchange rates during the
1970's and during earlier periods of generalized floating.
matter, the

logarithm

As a statistical

of spot exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other

major currencies (the British pound, the Deutsche mark, the French franc, the
Japanese yen and the Swiss franc) is generally well described as random walks
in which month—to—month and quarter-to—quarter changes are almost entirely
unpredictable.

Changes in spot exchange rates are generally closely

correlated with contemporaneous changes in forward exchange rates (especially
for large changes), indicating that movements in spot rates are closely
related to movements in the market's expectation of future spot rates.

—60—

Monthly and quarterly changes in exchange rates are not, however, closely
related to differentials in national inflation rates, implying that most
short-run changes in nominal exchange rates correspond changes in real
exchange rates (i.e., to deviations from purchasing power parities).
Moreover, monthly and quarterly changes in exchange rates are not closely
related to differentials in rates of monetary expansion or to current account
imbalances

30

These facts suggest that exchange rates should be viewed as prices of
durable assets determined in organized markets (like stock and commodity

exchanges) in which current price reflect the market's expectation concerning
present and future economic conditions relevant for determining the
appropriate values of these durable assets, and in which price changes are
largely unpredictable and reflect primarily new information that alters
expectations concerning these present and future economic conditions.

This

general notion of exchange rates as "asset prices" can be represented in
skeletal model in which the logarithm of the equilibrium exchange rate in
period t, denoted by e(t), is determined by31
e(t) =
where x(t)

X(t)

+

aE((e(t+1)

—

e(t));t)];

(4.14)

represents the basic econqmic conditions that affect the foreign

exchange market in period t, Et(e(t+1) —

e(t));t]

denotes the expected

percentage rate of change of the exchange rate between t and t+1 conditional
on information available at t, and the parameter a measures the sensitivity of
the current exchange rate to its expected rate of change.

To close the model,

it is assumed that expectations are "rational" in the sense that they are
consistent with the application of (4.14) in all future periods (and with a
suitable boundary condition).

By forward iteration, it follows that the

exchange rate that is expected at any t+j, for

—61--

information available at t, depends on a discounted sum of expected future
X'S, starting at t+j;

Setting j

(a/(1+a))1'E[x(t+j+i);t].

(4.15)

we obtain the "asset price" expression for the current exchange

rate as a discounted sum of present and expected future X's.
Using (4.15), we also obtain a convenient decomposition of the change in

The expected

change in the exchange rate is a discounted sum of expected future changes in
the X's;

De(e(t)) =

(1/(1+a))(a/(1+a))1.E(D(x(t+i));t].

(4.16)

Alternatively, the expected change in the exchange rate can be expressed as
proportional to the difference between the discounted sum of all expected
future X's that determines E[e(t+1);t] and the current X;
De(e(t)) =

(1/(1+a)).

[E( [e(t+1 );t) -

X(t)].

(4.17)

The unexpected change in the exchange rate is a discounted sum of changes in
expectations about future X'S based on new information received between t and
t+1;

D"(e(t))=(1/(1+a))E(a/(1+a)).[E(X(t+j÷1);t+1)—E(x(t+j+1);t)J.

(4.18)

These results provide a general rationale for many of the observed
regularities in the dynamic behavior of exchange rates.

The expected

component of monthly changes in exchange rates between major industrial

countries should usually be quite small because the factor of proportionality
1/(1+a) that appears in (4.17) is probably of the order of magnitude of 1/100,
implying that only very large differences between the current X and the

discounted sum of all future X's could justify a substantial expected change

—62—

in the exchange rate over a period of a month.32

In contrast, the unexpected

component of the monthly change in the exchange rate,which is necessarily
unpredictable on the basis of information available at t, could be quite
large.

If new information received between t and t+1 leads to a substantial

revision, in the same direction, of expectations, we should observe changes in
expectations concerning future exchange rates that are in the same direction
and are of similar magnitude as the unexpected change in the spot exchange
rate.33

This suggests a rationale for the observed relation between

unexpected movements in spot and forward exchange rates, especially for large
movements.

.3

Balance of payments equilibrium and the real exchange rate

One procedure for introducing specific economic content into the general
asset price model of exchange rates is to focus on the condition of balance of
payments equilthrium as the fundamental determinant of the equilibrium
exchange rate, and allowing for a suitable channel through which expected
changes in the exchange rate influence the balance of payments.

This

procedure is reminiscent of traditional flow market models of the
determination of excharigerates, and is also similar to a number of more
recent analyses of the interaction between the exchange rate and the current
account balance.34

In implementing this procedure, it is convenient initially

to deal with a real model of the determination of the real exchange rate, and

only subsequently (in the next section) to introduce the monetary
constderations centrally important in determining nominal exchange rates.35
For a moderate size country, the real exchange rate,

q,

is identified

with the logarithm of the relative price of domestic goods in terms of foreign
goods.

Domestic goods may either be exclusively nontraded goods or may be

—63--

goods for which there is a less than infinitely elastic foreign demand.
Consistent with either of these interpretations, it is plausible to assume
that the current account surplus

reflects the relative price elasticities of domestic and foreign excess
demands for domestic goods, r* is the (fixed) foreign real interest rate, and

A is the net stock of foreign assets (denominated in foreign goods) held by
domestic residents.

Absent changes in official holdings of foreign assets,

the current account surplus necessarily determines the rate of change of net
private holdings of foreign assets;

The result in (4.23) indicates that the current real exchange rate

depends on (i) the current estimate of the long—run equilibrium real exchange
rate,

(t),

that is expected to be consistent with the requirement that on

average (in present and future periods), the current account is balanced
(h =

and (ii) on the divergence between current net foreign asset

holdings and the current estimate of the long—run desired level of such

holdings, (t).

reflected in the dependence of (t)

reflects the sensitivity of the current

deficit both to expected rate of change of q and to the divergence of net
foreign assets from their target level.
It is noteworthy that the asset price expression for the real exchange

rate that is embodied in (4.23) is consistent with a sophisticated version of
the traditional flow market model of exchange rate determination.

As

illustrated in figure 4.3, the current real exchange rate may be thought of as
being determined by the intersection of the

schedule, characterizing the

flow of foreign exchange arising from current account transactions,

b =

•(z

and the

c

schedule, characterizing the flow of

foreign exchange arising from capital account transactions,
c = 1l'(A — A) —

ct(E[q(t+1);

—

q),

where the expected future real exchange

rate, E[q(t+1);t], is treated as a parameter affecting the position of the c
schedule.37

The element of sophistication that transforms this traditional

model into the asset pricing results expressed by (4.23) is the assumption
that expectations concerning the future real exchange rate are consistent with
the economic forces that will actually determine the future real exchange
rate.

The present results are also consistent with recent models of the dynamic
interaction between the exchange rate and the current account which view the
current exchange rate as determined by the willingness of asset holders to
hold existing stocks of foreign assets, and which view the rate of change of
the exchange

(4.32)

we find that (the logarithm of) the current nominal exchange

This result represents the "asset price version" of the simple monetary
model of exchange rate determination discussed in section 4.1.

Its advantage

over this simpler model is that it indcates clearly dependence of the current
exchange rate not only on current money supplies and money demands, but also
on the entire expected future time paths of money supplies and money
demands.43

In accord with the general principles of the asset price view of

exchange rates, the expected rate of change of the exchange rate is a
discounted sum of expected future changes in

In (4.32), the influence of real factors on the expected path of the

exchange rate comes through their effect on the expected paths of

nominal

The results (4.33) to (4.35) represent the asset price version of the

extended monetary model of exchange rate determination considered before.
From these results, we find that a discounted sum of present and expected
future money supplies affects the nominal exchange rate by affecting the
general level of all domestic prices.

Movements in the nominal exchange rate

that are associated with expected or unexpected changes in this discounted sum
of present and future m's are consistent with the maintenance of purchasing
power parity.

By the same token, changes in the foreign price level, which

are not associated with changes in domestic money demand or supply or in the
relative price of domestic goods in terms of foreign goods, induce movements
in the nominal exchange rate that are consistent with purchasing power parity.
Real economic factors influence the exchange rate through two channels:

to

the extent that such factors affect the discounted sum of present and future
levels of demand for domestic money (measured by the

Us),

they induce

movements in the nominal exchange rate that are consistent with purchasing
power parity; however, to the extent that such real factors induce movements
in the relative price of domestic goods in terms of foreign goods, they
require movements in the nominal exchange rate and in prices that constitute
divergences from purchasing power parity.
When

we combine the model of the nominal exchange rate embodied in

(4.33)- (4.35) with the model of the real exchange rate discussed in

the

preceding section, we arrive at a general model in which the exchange rate
exhibits the essential properties of an "asset price," while, at the same
time, the general model also incorporates

the key ingredients

of both monetary

models that focus on conditions of flow market equilibrium, as the critical
determinants of exchange rates.

This already general model of exchange rate

determination can be further extended by introducing phenomena associated with

—72—

macroeconomic disequilibria.

The two modern approaches to the modelling of

such phenomena are (i) the contracting models and (ii) the incomplete
information models.

I3oth share the common feature that stabilization policy

(especially monetary policy) has no capacity to affect the long—run

equilibrium behavior of national output, but they differ critically in their
implications for the successful short—run use of stabilization policy.

In the

contracting models, changes in the money supply that were unanticipated at the
time when existing nominal contracts were established can temporarily affect
the level of national output, and the government can use its freedom to act
with respect to monetary policy (while private agents are locked into existing
nominal contracts) to improve the performance of national output [see Fischer
(1977), Phelps and Taylor (1977), Taylor (1980)].

In contrast, in the

incomplete information models, unanticipated changes in the money supply can
temporarily affect national output, but stabilization policies linked to past

values o variables observed by private agents have no capacity to improve the
performance of national output, [see Lucas (1972, 1975), Barro (1976)].

The key implications of these two approaches to modelling macroeconomic
disequilibrium for the behavior of national output carry over from the closed
economy setting in which they were originally developed to an open economy
setting.

In either approach, unanticipated money supply changes temporarily

affect domestic output and, in general, have some effect on foreign output;
but only in the contracting approach can stabilization policy be used
successfully to improve the performance on national output.44

In addition to

these implications with respect to national outputs, models that incorporate

macroeconomic disequilibrium introduce the possibility that monetary
disturbances may induce short—run price and exchange rate movements that
diverge from purchasing power parity.

In the incomplete information approach,

—73—

such divergences are simply one of the manifestations of the real effects of
unanticipated monetary changes, without any policy significance.

In the

contracting approach, stickiness of nominal prices resulting from existing

nominal contracts may necessitate "overshooting" of the nominal exchange rate
in response unanticipated monetary changes and an associated temporary but

persistent change in the real exchange rate.45

This "overshooting" response

to the nominal exchange rate may provide additional leverage for monetary
policy to affect the short-run behavior of national output, and may increase
the usefulness of exchange rates as indcators for the conduct of stabilization
policy.
4.5

Empirical issues in exchange rate analysis

one of the significant developments characterizing research in
international economics during the last decade has been the prolification of
empirical work.46

In this section we will only highlight some aspects of this

research.

The empirical methodology followed three general lines.

The first

examined the characteristics of the foreign exchange market, the second
examined the validity of basic parity conditions and the third examined the
performance of speicifc models.

An example of the first line of research has been an examination of
market efficiency.

For an asset market to be "efficient" prices must

appropriately reflect all available information and thus it should be
impossible to make extra—ordinary profits by exploiting generally available
information.

Tests of foreign exchange market efficiency have focused on (1)

the statistical properties of forward rates as predictors of future spot
rates,

(ii) the time—series properties of exchange rates and of deviations

from forward rates (iii) the relative degree of volatility of spot and forward

—74—

rates,

(iv) the ability to improve on market forecasts of future exchange

rates by using past spot and forward exchange rates and other publicly
available information, and (v) the capacity to make extra—ordinary profits by
employing various trading rules.

Different tests applied to differrent

exchange rates in different time periods have not reached a unanimous
consensus concerning the hypothesis of market efficiency.47
Tests of the various parity conditions examined the performance of the
interest parity theory and the purchasing power parity doctrine.

Tests of the

interest parity have generally been favorable to the predictions of the theory
at least when account is taken of the costs and timing of transactions in
various markets [see, for example, Frenkel and Levich (1975, 1977)].

In

contrast, tests of the purchasing power parity doctrine have not figured as
well.

The data specifically during the 1970's, suggest that short—run changes

in exchange rates bear little relationship to short—run differentials in
national inflation rates, particularly as measured by consumer price
indices.

Further, changes in exchange rates over longer periods of time have

frequently been associated with large cumulative divergences from relative
purchasing power parities.48

As an analytical matter, purchasing power

parities can be expected to hold in the long run if most of the shocks to the
system are of a monetary origin which do not require changes in relative
prices.

The evidence on the large cumulative deviations from purchasing power

parities are consistent with prominance of "real" shocks.

It is relevant to

note that the short-run deviations from purchasing power parities reflect, in
addition to the effects of real shocks, the intrinsic differences between the
properties of exchange rates and those of national price levels.

Exchange

rates, like other asset prices, are likely to respond promptly to new
information which alters expectations, while national price level exhibits

—75—

some "stickiness" reflecting the cost of price adjustment which
result in
nominal contracts of finite length.

The resulting difference between the

time—series properties of exchange rates and

prices

is reflected in the low

correlation between the practically random month—to—month exchange—rate
changes and the serially correlated differences between national
rates of
inflation.

The third line of research has tested directly the performance of
specific models.

The monetary model was reasonable successful when applied to

extreme episodes like the German hyperinflation of the 1920's where monetary
shocks dominated the scene.

However, when applied to more regular periods it

yielded mixed results [see, for example, Frenkel (1976), Frenkel and Clements
(1982), Bilson (1978a, 1978b) and Hodrick (1978)].

Modifications of the

simple monetary model which included elements of the term structure of the
interest ra€e and which allowed for a trend in the income velocity have
enjoyed limited success but have faced the difficulties arising from parameter
instability [see, for example, Frankel (1979, 1984), Dornbusch (1978)].
Likewise, tests of the portfolio—balance model yielded occasionally mixed
success but further examination yielded poor results (see, for example,
Branson, Haittunen and Massori (1977) and Frarikel (1984)].

While the various

models might have enjoyed some success in accounting for the variability
of
exchange

rates during a specific sample period, all have performed poorly when

applied to out—of— sample data [see, for example, Meese and Rogoff (1983)].

It seems that at the present stage the empirical evidence taken
suggest

rate

the lack

of a satisfactory structural

as a whole,

model accounting for exchange

behavior.

The analytical framework that was developed in section 4.2 views the
exchange rate as an asset price which is highly sensitive to new information

—76—

that alters expecatations.

This general view implies that empirical research

on the determinats of exchange rate changes should relate these changes to the
"innovations" in the relevant variables.49

The econometric modelling of these

issues are, however, complex since they involve measurements of unanticipated
events.

Therefore, tests of these models are always joint tests of the

specification of the model and of the decomposition of events into their
anticipated and unanticipated components.

Recent work on the relation between

exchange rate and "news" measured "news" in a variety of ways and have
produced evidence consistent with this general analytical view.50

While this

line of research is relatively new in exchange rate analysis, applications in
other areas on economics suggest the potential for considerable promise.

essential features of the monetary mechanism of balance of payments adjustment
are preserved.

should be noted that when properly specified other approaches to
exchange rate determination would also yield reduced form equation like (4.10)

with money supplies, incomes, interest rates and relative prices appearing on
the right—hand side.

The virtue of the monetary approach in comparison with

the elasticities approach is in bringing these variables to the foreground
rather than leaving them in the "background".

is noteworthy that the shift of emphasis from flow consideration to
the requirement of stock equilibrium revived issues from the Bullionist
controversy of the early 1800's which led to the competing "Balance of
Payments Theory" and "Inflation Theory" of exchange rate determination; see
Ricardo (1811) and Viner (1937).

For an early modern formulation emphasizing

stock equilibrium see Black (1973).

29See for example Mussa (1974) and Frenkel and Johnson (1976a); in the

context of flexible exchange rates the same argument is made by Dornbusch
(1976b) and Mussa (1976b).

It should be noted that the money demand—money

supply framework is not employed only for convenience; it reflects the
hypotheses

that money markets clear fast relative to goods markets, that the

demands for real balance are relatively stable and that the supply of nominal

balances is a policy instrument that is controlled by the monetary

authorities.
30A number of empirical studies
with

have reported results that are consistent

the empirical regularities discussed in this paragraph; see, for example

Mussa (1979b), Frenkel (1981a, 1981b) and, in

in

this volume.

particular, Chapter 19 by Levich

The implications of these regularities for the general

approach to the theory of exchange rate determination are considered in Mussa
(1979b, 1984), Frenkel and Mussa (1980), Frenkel (1981b) and Mussa (1982).

82

31The present exposition of the "asset price" view of exchange rates
draws on that given in Frerikel and Mussa (1980), Frenkel (1981b) and Mussa
(1982, 1984).
(1976b).

Key elements of this view are also contained in Mussa

It is also relevant to note that while our exposition presents a

specific version of the "asset price" view of exchange rates, there are also
other versions that may be termed as "asset views"; see for example the
version of the portfolio balance model presented by Branson and Henderson in
Criapter 15 of this volume.

32A value of 1/(1+a) equal to 1/100 means that an adjustment of about one
percent in the annual expected rate of change of the exchange rate will offset
a ten percent divergence between the current month's expected X and the
discounted sum of X's in all future months.

33The

role of new information in inducing unexpected movements in

exchange rates is emphasized by Dornbusch
Mussa (1980), and

(1978), Frenkel (1981b), Frenkel and

Mussa (1976c, 1977, 197gb, 1980, and 1982).

34The "traditional approach" is the textbook approach in which the
equilibrium exchange rate is determined by
for

the intersection of the flow demand

foreign exchange arising from trade transactions with the speculative

supply

of foreign exchange provided by capital holders who are prepared to

undertake risks in exchange for expected gains.

More sophisticated versions

of this approach are presented in the work of Black (1973), Stein (1980).
the interaction between the exchange rate and the current account see
Dornbusch and Fischer (1980), Rodriguez (1980), Mussa (1980, 1982), Sachs
(1981) and Frenkel and Rodriguez (1982).

On

83

35me model considered in this section is developed in greater detail in
Mussa (1984).

Other models that emphasize the importance of real factors in

determining the real exchange rate include those presented by Bruno and
Sachs
(1982), Buiter and Miller (1983), Neary and Purvis (1983), and Svennson
and
Razin (1983).

36The equations of the present model
are all assumed to be linear in the

levels or logarithms of the eridogenous and exogenous variables.

This

assumption allows for the explicit solution of the forward looking difference
equation system that constitutes the reduced form of the model.

implies that the Marshall—Lerner condition is

satisfied; an increase in the relative price of domestic goods, holding other
factors constant, worsens the current account.

c

schedule is frequently identified with the activities of

foreign exchange speculators.

From a theoretical perspective, however, there

is no good reason for such an identification; the c schedule represents
desired behavior of all economic agents with respect to acquisition of foreign
assets.

For further discussion of this point,

and of the meaning of the

"balance of payments equilibrium condition" represen.ted by equation (4.22),
see Mussa (1984).

38Kouri (1976) develops the idea that the current exchange rate, which

depends primarily on the conditions of asset market equilibrium, affects the
current

change of these asset positions, in turn, feedback through the

similar view of the essential elements in the dynamic

interaction between the exchange rate and the current account is embodied in

84

the

models developed by Branson (1977), Branson, Haltunen and Masson (1977),

Calvo and Rodriguez (1977), Dornbusch and Fischer (1980), Flood (1981),
Niehans (1977), and Rodriguez (1980).

39me importance of these elements in understanding the dynamic behavior
of the real exchange rate and its relation to the current account is
emphasized in Mussa (1980).

The "accounting framework" for the analysis of

exchange rate dynamics developed by Dooley and Isard (1981) and Isard (1983)
also incorporates these elements.

Models developed by Marion (1981), Obstfeld

(1981), Sachs (1981), and Helpman and Razin (1983) consider the effect of

temporary expected disturbances in the current account of the behavior of the
exchange rate.

40me analysis in this section is based on Mussa (1984).

A similar

approach to combining real and monetary factors in a model of the real and
nominal exchange rate is adopted by Bruno and Sachs (1981), Buiter and Miller
(1983) and Mussa (1977b).

A different approach for incorporating real and

monetary factors is motivated by a "finance constraint" (which is also being
refered to as the "Clower constraint") requiring goods to be purchased with
currency accumulated in advance of the period in which trade takes place; see
Stockman (1980), Helpman (1981) and Lucas (1982).

Kouri (1976), Stockman (1978), Fama and Farber (1981), Hansen and Hodrich

This risk premium

could be allowed to be a function of any of the variables that appear in the

money demand function (4.28) without significantly affecting the formal
analysis carried out in this section.

no other source of non—neutrality (such as fixed nominal contracts or
incomplete information about the behavior of nominal variables),
then the
model of the real exchange rate discussed in the preceding section
operates
independently of the behavior of the domestic money supply.

Even if these

conditions are not satisfied (4.32) remains valid, but it is
necessary to

consider the effect of the behavior of money supply and other nominal
variables on real exchange rate and the stock of net foreign assets.
43The reduced-form money market equilibrium
condition (4.30) is used in

Mussa (1976b) to derive the result (4.32).

The present analysis shows that

this reduced form is consistent with a fairly general model of goods and
asset
market equilibrium.

disequilibrium in an open economy setting see Flood (1979), Saidi (1980)
and
