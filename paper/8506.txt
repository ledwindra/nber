Volatility Dependence and Contagion in Emerging Equity Markets

JEL No. F3, G12, G15

ABSTRACT
In this paper we use weekly stock market data for a group of Latin American countries to analyze
the behavior of volatility through time. We are particularly interested in understanding whether periods
of high volatility are correlated across countries. The analysis uses both on univariate and bivariate
switching volatility models. Our results do not rely on the correlation coefficients, but on the codependence of volatility regimes. The results indicate that high-volatility episodes are, in general, shortlived, lasting from two to twelve weeks. We find strong evidence of volatility co-movements across
countries, especially among the Mercosur countries.

I. Introduction
In the aftermath of the East Asian and Russian crises of the 1990s a number of
authors have argued that capital mobility has gone too far, creating a highly unstable
international financial system. Some analysts have even argued that the emerging
countries should implement policies aimed at slowing down capital flows. Specific
proposals have included imposing a Tobin tax on foreign exchange transactions, and
introducing controls on capital inflows (see Edwards 1999).
In this paper we use data from a group of Latin American and Asian countries to
investigate two issues that have been at the center of recent debates on the international
financial system: First, we analyze whether the degree of financial instability has indeed
increased during the last several years. We do this by analyzing weekly behavior of stock
market returns. Second, we investigate whether periods of increased stock market
volatility coincide across countries. Understanding these issues has a number of
important policy implications. Indeed, supporters of the imposition of capital controls
have largely based their views on the notion that periods of financial instability are
transmitted across countries.
We address these issues by using both univariate, as well as multivariate
techniques. We first follow a variant of Hamilton and Susmel’s (1994) SWARCH
methodology, to identify breakpoints in an ARCH model of the conditional variance of
stock market returns. A particular attractive feature of this approach is that it allows us to
date periods of unusually high volatility. We find that, although the degree of volatility
does change through time, it has not experienced, in any of our countries, a secular
increase. Our results indicate that in most (but not all) countries the “unusually high
volatility states” are short-lived. We also find that these periods of “high volatility” tend
to roughly coincide across some countries.
Our analysis departs from other work in the area in that we also use a multivariate
extension of the SWARCH model to explore whether there are co-movements in stock
market volatility across countries. This type of analysis is particularly important in
current debates on financial “contagion” across countries. Indeed, the existence of
statistically significant comovements in volatility can be interpreted as providing some
evidence regarding the presence of contagion. In particular, a simultaneous increase in

2

the (conditional) variance of stock returns would have important implications for the
interpretation of traditional models of contagion, based on detecting break-points in
simple returns correlations across countries --see Forbes and Rigobon, (1999).
Since multivariate SWARCH models are highly intensive in computing time, in
this paper we restrict its application to pairs of countries. The bivariate SWARCH model
allows for dependence not only through the correlation coefficient, but also through the
Markov matrix, which determines the different volatility states. We find evidence for
state-dependent correlations, where the high volatility states tend to be related to
international crises. During high volatility periods due to international crisis, correlations
among Latin American emerging stock markets increase between two to four times. We
find strong evidence of volatility dependence among all Latin American markets. We
also find that Hong Kong, which we take as an emblematic representative of the Asian
financial crisis of 1997, does not show a non-linear state dependence with most of the
Latin American nations.1
Our analysis is in a spirit similar to that studies on the effects of 1987 stock
market crash on financial volatility across countries --see Bennett and Kelleher (1988),
King and Wadhwani (1990). Other papers that deal with cross country volatility include
the studies on “meteor showers” by Engle, Ito and Lin (1990, 1992), and Hamano, Ng
and Masulis (1990), and the studies on equity markets time-varying correlations by
Longin and Solnik (1995), and Ramchand and Susmel (1998). The paper is organized as
follows. Section I is the introduction. In Section II we discuss the data used in the
analysis. In Section III, we use univariate SWARCH models to analyze interest rate
volatility in our five countries. Section IV contains the results for the multivariate case.
Finally, section V is the conclusions.

II. Equity Returns in the 1990s: Preliminary Data Analysis
The data used in this article consists of time series of weekly equity indexes,
denominated in U.S. dollars, for Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Hong Kong and Mexico. The sample
covers the period from the last week of August 1989 to the third week of October 1999. The

In a companion paper we use data for all five countries to analyze “volatility
comovements” in domestic interest rates. See Edwards and Susmel (2000).

3

data were taken from the Morgan Stanley Capital International data set. The indexes have been
constructed not to double count those stocks multiple-listed on foreign stock exchanges; they are
value weighted, and they cover at least 80% of each country’s stock-market capitalization. These
stock market indexes are transformed into weekly (Thursday to Thursday) rates of returns. In
Table 1 we present information on the mean, standard deviation, skewness coefficient, Kurtosis
coefficient, the Jarque-Bera Normality test (JB), and Ljung-Box test (LB). All these series show
the typical non-normality of financial time series (see the JB test results). The high kurtosis
coefficient is also typical of high frequency financial time series, and it is behind the rejection of
normality. The Ljung-Box (LB) statistics suggest significant autocorrelation in the levels only
for Argentina. The Ljung-Box (LBS) statistics, for the squared levels, are significant, with the
exception of Hong Kong. That is, there is significant autocorrelation for the squared returns,
which we take as evidence for an ARCH-type process for the conditional variance. In the
analysis that follows in Sections III and IV we are interested in understanding in detail the nature
of stock market volatility in these five countries. In particular, we are interested in investigating
whether there has been a trend towards higher stock market volatility in these markets. We also
use our data set to inquire whether high volatility states coincide across countries.

III. Stock Returns Volatility and Breakpoints: Univariate Analysis
III.1 The Model
Most studies on stock returns volatility are based on the estimation of GARCH-type
models discussed in Campbell, Lo and MacKinlay (1997). Although standard GARCH models
are parsimonious, and are able to capture the time varying nature of volatility, they fail to capture
structural shifts in the data that are caused by low probability events, such as the stock market
Crash of 1987, the so-called Tequila effect, or other international financial crises, among other. In
this paper we use a variant of the model of Hamilton and Susmel (1994) to explicitly model the
dynamics of switching variance. Hamilton and Susmel (1994) modify the ARCH specification to
account for such structural changes in the data and propose a Switching ARCH (SWARCH)
model. The SWARCH (K,q) model used in this paper is:

(1)

∆rt = a0 + a1 ∆rt-1 + εt,

εt|It-1 ∼ N(0,ht)

(2)

ht/γst = α0 + Σi=1 αi ε2t-i/γst-i

i = 1,2,...,q, and st=1,2,..,K,

4

where rt is the log of the stock market index, and the γ's are scale parameters that capture the
change in regime. One of the γ's is unidentified and, hence, γ1 is set equal to 1.
The SWARCH model requires a formulation of the probability law that causes the
economy to switch among regimes. One simple specification is that the state of the economy is the
outcome of a K-state Markov chain that is independent of rt for all t:
(3)

Prob (st = j|st-1 = i, st-2 = k,..., rt, rt-1, rt-2,...) = Prob (st = j|st-1 = i) = pij.

Under this specification, the transition probabilities, the pij's, are constant. For example, if the
economy was in a high volatility state last period (st=2), the probability of changing to the low
volatility state (st=1) is a fixed constant p21. Maximum likelihood estimation of the model (1)-(3) is
straightforward --see Hamilton (1989) for details. For the univariate estimates, each country is
estimated independently of the other.
As a byproduct of the maximum likelihood estimation, Hamilton (1989) shows that it is
possible to make inferences about the particular state of the market under study, at any date. The
“filter probabilities,” p(st,st-1|rt,rt-1,..,r-3), denote the conditional probability that the state at date t is
st, and that at date t-1 was st-1. These probabilities are conditional on the values of r observed
through date t. The “smooth probabilities,” p(st|rT,rT-1,...,r-3), on the other hand, are inferences
about the state at date t based on data available through some future date T (end of sample). For a
two-state specification, for example, the smooth probabilities at time t are represented by a 2x1
vector denoting the probability estimates of the two states. That is, the smooth probabilities
represent the ex-post inference made by an analyst/econometrician about the state of the security at
time t, based on the entire time series.
II. 2 Results
As a first step in our analysis of stock markets volatility we estimated, for each one of
the series, a simple AR(1)-GARCH(1,1) model. The results, reported in Table 2, indicate that
there are significant ARCH effects for all the series. The LB statistics for the standardized
residuals show no further evidence of autocorrelation in the level of the standardized residuals or
in the squared standardized residuals. The size of α1 tends to be unusually high for high
frequency financial time series. Also, for Chile β1 is unusually low. Moreover, for most

5

countries the sum of α1 and β1 is close to one, which makes shocks to the conditional variance
highly persistent over time.2 Lamoureux and Lastrapes (1990) and Hamilton and Susmel (1994)
argue that the observed high persistence of shocks to the conditional variance is a sign of structural
change in the statistical process generating the variance.
We formally test the null hypothesis of no regime-switch by using the likelihood ratio test
proposed by Hansen (1992, 1994). A likelihood ratio test of this null hypothesis does not have the
usual limiting chi-squared distribution, because the parameters pij are unidentified under the null.
Hansen (1992) proposes a test, based on empirical theory process, that is able to provide an upper
bound to the asymptotic distribution of standardized likelihood ratio statistics, even when
conventional regularity conditions (such as unidentified parameters) are violated.3 We calculate
Hansen's test for all the series under the null hypothesis of no regime-switching, using a four-lag
Newey-West correction. The standardized likelihood ratio tests and their corresponding p-values
are reported in Table 2. As may be seen, the hypothesis of no regime switch is rejected in all cases.
After rejecting the hypothesis of no-regime switch, the next step is to use the (SWARCH)
model of Hamilton and Susmel (1994), to identify periods of unusually high volatility. We fit
different SWARCH specifications. We estimated models with K=2 to 4 states and q=0 to 3
autoregressive terms. We estimated SWARCH models with asymmetric effects, as proposed by
Glosten, Jaganathan and Runkle (1993)4 and with t-distributed conditional errors. Since we are
interested in bivariate switching results, and three states considerably complicate the bivariate
estimation, we focus our attention to a two-state system. Our results suggest, however, that for
2

Again, it is usual to observe, in high frequency financial series, the so-called Integrated GARCH model,
where α1+β1=1.
3
To get around the problem of no identified parameters under the null, Hansen (1994) defines a function
qt(ζ) = Lt[ζ,λ(ζ)] - Lt[ζ0,λ(ζ0)],
where Lt[ζ,λ(ζ)], represents the conditional log likelihood of the tth observation when evaluated at ζ and λ(ζ). The
parameters ζ and λ represent a partition of the parameter space. For the two-state case ζ=(p11,p22,γ2). Under the null
hypothesis of no regime-switching ζ=ζ0=(1,0,1). We investigated a grid containing 345 possible parameters for ζ
under the alternative hypothesis, with Z consisting of these 345 possibilities considered. For any ζ, λ(ζ) is estimated
by maximizing the likelihood with respect to λ, given ζ. Hansen (1994) proposes the following standardized test:
LR = maxζεZ T mq(ζ)/[Σt (qt(ζ) - mq(ζ))2]1/2,
where mq is the mean of qt. Hansen shows that, if the null hypothesis of no regime-change is true, then for large
samples the probability that LR would exceed a critical value z is less than the probability that a Monte Carlo
simulated statistic would exceed the same value z.
4

We estimated the following SWARCH model, which incorporates an asymmetric effect of negative news:
ht/γst = α0 + Σi=1 αi ε2t-i/γst-I + κ Lt-1 ε2t-i/γst-I i = 1,2,...,q, and st=1,2,..,K, where Lt-1= 0 if εt-I <0 and Lt-1=1,
otherwise.

6

some countries a three-state SWARCH models may be appropriate5. The results obtained are
reported in Table 3. Several interesting findings emerge from this table. First, the switching
parameters, the γi's, are significantly different than one in all series. That is, for each of our five
national stock markets it is possible to distinguish a “low,” and a “high” volatility state. Second,
for all the series we notice that using the SWARCH(2,1) model causes the ARCH effects to be
reduced or to disappear. Third, with the exception of Chile, we find no evidence for an asymmetric
effect of negative news on conditional volatility. That is, with the exception of Chile, unexpected
negative surprises to returns do not have a bigger impact on volatility than positive news.
The results for the estimated γi's are particularly interesting. As Hamilton and Susmel
(1994) show, γj provides an estimate of the ratio of the conditional variance in state j, relative to the
“low volatility” state. That is, in our two-state case, γ2 provides information on how much higher
is high volatility relative to low volatility. For example, in one extreme, for Argentina’s stock
returns the high volatility state is on average around ten times higher than that in the low volatility
state. On the other hand, for Hong Kong the high volatility state is on average around five times
higher than that in the low volatility state.
The basic results obtained from our bivariate analysis are summarized in Figures 1 through
5. Consider first Figure 1. The top panel presents plots the Argentinean weekly stock returns. The
second panel plots the smoothed probability that the economy was at state 1 (low volatility) at time
t;, the third panel plots the smoothed probability that the economy was at state 2 (high volatility) at
time t. The observations are classified following Hamilton's (1989) proposed method for dating
regime switches. According to this procedure, an observation belongs to state i if the smoothed
probability Prob(st=i|rT,rT-1,...,r-3) is higher than 0.5. According to Figure 1, stock market returns in
Argentina switch between the low volatility state and the high volatility state during the first four
years of the sample. Then, starting in 1993 – a time that coincides with the consolidation of
Argentina’s currency board -- Argentine stock returns tend to have long stays in the low volatility
state. Only during the Mexican (late 1994), Asian (late 1997), Russian (August-September 1998)
and Brazilian (January 1999) crises, Argentine stock returns switched to the high volatility state.
5

Standard likelihood ratios reject, with the exception of Mexico, the null hypothesis of a two-state model
against the three-state model. Standard likelihood ratio tests, however, cannot be used, because the
parameters pij, for the third state, are unidentified under the null hypothesis of two-states. Precise Hansen
(1992) tests are computationally expensive in this case, because of the large number of parameters needed for
the grid. Interestingly enough, our analysis on domestic interest rates in these five countries suggests that a
three-state representation is more adequate for interest rates.

7

Figures 2 to 5 present similar graphs for Brazil, Chile, Mexico and Hong Kong. In general, we
observe a similar behavior than for the Argentinean case.
An interesting feature of the results in Figures 1 to 5 is that, at a first glance, it appears that
since late 1994 the stays of Latin American stock market returns in the high volatility states
correspond (roughly) to foreign (exogenous) events. Indeed, the analysis of the figures indicate that
after 1994 shifts to the high volatility state tend to coincide with the Mexican crisis, the Asian crisis,
the Russian crisis, and the Brazilian crisis, respectively. These results may suggest that indeed
emerging markets were subject to some form of “volatility contagion” during these crises
upheavals. We analyze this hypothesis in greater detail in the next section, where we use a bivariate
switching volatility model to investigate whether we can reject the hypothesis of volatility comovements and independence in pairs of countries. It is important to notice that the “high
volatility” state detected before 1994 cannot be attributed –or at least nor easily– to external events.
In order to investigate this issue further, we estimated, for each of our five countries, a
three-states SWARCH model. We label the third state as “unusually high volatility.” The results
from this exercise can be summarized as follows (figures and details available on request):
(1) All four Latin American countries exhibit an “unusually high volatility”spike in late
1994. This corresponds to what has come to be known as the “tequila effect” crisis.
As we expected, Mexico – the country where the 1994 currency crisis began– was the
first country to experience, at this time, a shift to the “unusually high volatility”state.
(2) Volatility of stock market returns in Hong-Kong did not experience an increase at the
time of the “tequila crisis.” Interestingly, this contrasts with the behavior of nominal
domestic interest rates analyzed by Edwards and Susmel (2000).
(3) In four of the countries in the sample there are “unusually high volatility spikes” in
late 1997, at the time the Hong Kong currency board came under attack. The only
exception to this is Chile.
(4) Four of the countries experienced a shift to the “unusually high volatility state” in
August-September 1998, when Russia devalued the ruble and defaulted on its debt.
Chile is, once again, the exception
(5) Finally, Argentina, Brazil and Mexico experienced a shift in volatility to the
“unusually high state” in January 1999, when Brazil devalued the real and entered
into a (short-lived) crisis.

8

A particularly interesting result from this exercise is that for Hong Kong and Chile,
countries with a history of credible economic policies, the “unusually high” volatility periods are
few and do not last more than two weeks. Indeed, the relative long stays in the “unusually high”
volatility state and the relative high occurrence of unusual volatility for Argentina, Brazil and
Mexico are likely to reflect a low degree of credibility enjoyed by the government economic
policies, especially in the period before 1994.6
Table 4 contains a summary of our findings on the extent and duration of “unusually
high volatility” in the periods surrounding the Mexican, East Asian, Russian and Brazilian
currency crises of the 1990s. Each entry, in Table 4, provides, for each of our countries, a
starting date for the high volatility state, as well as the number of weeks the economy was in the
high volatility state. Although we are reluctant to label these episodes as “volatility contagion,”
we argue that it is suggestive that our countries experienced a significant increase in volatility in
the period following a major crisis. It is also interesting to note that the crises countries
themselves are indeed the first to experience a shift to the high volatility state. The fact that the
dates of high volatility states roughly coincide, is indeed suggestive, but does not constitute
statistical evidence in favor of either the “volatility co-movement” or the “volatility contagion”
hypotheses. In order to investigate this issue formally, it is necessary to extend the SWARCH
model used in this section to the multivariate case. This we do in the section that follows.
IV.

Cross Country Volatility Co-Movements: Multivariate Results
The results from the preceding section provide some preliminary evidence of

(roughly) coincidental stock market volatility switches across countries during the second half
of the 1990s. In this section, we explore this issue further by developing a bivariate switching
volatility model.7 We take advantage of the Markov process by the Hamilton (1989) filter to
test whether volatility states are independent across countries. Generally speaking, there will be
independence, if national stock markets are segmented. If, however, stock markets are highly
integrated, shocks will be transmitted rapidly across countries, and the hypothesis of
independence would be rejected.
6

See Ruge-Murcia (1995) for a “credibility” interpretation of switching states along the lines discussed
here.
7
Edwards (1998) finds evidence of "volatility spillovers" among Mexico, Argentina and Chile. This finding
seems to confirm a positive correlation of high variances in international stock markets.

9

To test the above hypotheses, we estimate a multivariate formulation of the
SWARCH model. As it turns out, this multivariate SWARCH model is extremely intensive in
computation time. This means that the econometrician has to make some choices in terms of the
number of volatility states, and number of countries included in the analysis. In order to keep
the number of parameters tractable, in this section we estimate a bivariate SWARCH model –
that is, we restrict our analysis to the case of two countries and two volatility states (high
volatility and low volatility). In order to organize the discussion, and reduce the dimensionality
of the problem, we concentrate on the cases of Mexico and Hong-Kong. More specifically, we
investigate whether it is possible to reject the hypotheses that the volatility processes are
independent in the following pairs of countries:
(a) Mexico-Argentina, Mexico-Brazil, Mexico-Chile;
(b) Hong Kong-Argentina, Hong Kong-Brazil, Hong Kong-Chile;
(c) Hong Kong-Mexico.
This already gives us seven two-country combinations. We have focused on Mexico and Hong
Kong -- which we call (potential) volatility “originators”– because we want to explore the
(popular) notion that the crises originated in these countries spread into what was then called the
“Tequila Effect” and the “Asian Flu,” respectively.8 We refer to the other three countries -Argentina, Chile and Brazil – as “potential recipient countries”. Testing whether volatility
states were (statistically) related across “originator” and “recipient” countries is indeed the
purpose of this section.
Suppose then that we have two series (countries), with two volatility states. In this
bivariate formulation, the number of states is four. For instance, with Mexico and Argentina in a
system, we have the following four primitive states, st*:
st*=1: Mexico - Low volatility, Argentina- Low volatility.
st*=2: Mexico - Low volatility, Argentina- High volatility.
st*=3: Mexico - High volatility, Argentina - Low volatility.
st*=4: Mexico - High volatility, Argentina - High volatility.

8

Of course, the Asian crisis could be dated a bit earlier, with the collapse of the Thai Baht. However, as
the data in Figures 3 through 7 clearly show, no country in our sample suffered increase instability until the
Hong Kong Dollar was attacked by speculators in late October, 1997.

10

The system can be written as:
(4)

rt = A + B rt-1 + et, et|It-1 ∼ N(0,Ht),

where rt = [rxt,ryt] is a 2x1 vector of returns, et =[ext,eyt] is a 2x1 vector of disturbances, which
follow a bivariate normal distribution, with zero mean and a time varying conditional
covariance matrix Ht (for notational convenience, we drop the dependence of Ht on the states of
the economy). The conditional covariance matrix Ht is specified as a constant correlation matrix
where the diagonal elements follow a SWARCH process. We allow the correlation coefficient
to be state-dependent. We let the correlation coefficient to change with the volatility state of the
originator country.9 This formulation provides an algebraic model that defines the notion of
originator. An originator is a country whose change in the volatility state causes a change in the
correlation coefficient with a recipient country. Later, we relax this assumption. The
specification set in equation (4) allows the series rxt and ryt to be related through the nonlinearities associated with dependent states. A = [ax,ay] and B = [bx, by] are 2x1 vectors.
As it was assumed for the univariate case, the probability law that causes the
economy to switch among states is given by a K*=4 state Markov chain, P*, with a typical
element given by Prob(st* = j|st-1* = i) = pij*. For the four state model, some of the pij*’s are
close to zero, in order to get convergence, we treat these parameters as given, and equal to zero.
This reduces the number of parameters to be estimated. As discussed in Hamilton and Lin
(1996), this specification is very general and encompasses different interactions among the
volatility states of both countries. That is, the transition probabilities, the pij*'s, could be
restricted to fit different assumptions about the underlying volatility states. For example,
focusing on p24*, if the volatility states of Mexico and Argentina are independent, p24* = p12Mex
p22Arg. On the other hand, if the Mexican volatility states are shared by Argentina, then p24* = 0.
Our bivariate analysis is in three steps: (1) We first estimate the unrestricted model,
together with the smoothed probabilities for the four states s*t=j (j=1,2,3,4) described above.
We are interested in finding out whether pairs of countries are jointly in the “high-high”
volatility state, and more specifically we are interested in determining whether this happens
around the time of the currency crises of the 1990s. (2) In the second step we formally test
whether the volatility states are independent across pairs of countries. And (3), for those cases
9

Ht is a 2x2 covariance matrix. The diagonal elements are given by equation (2), while the off-diagonal
(covariance) elements, hxyt, are give by hxyt,=ρst [hxt,hyt]1/2, where ρst is the state-dependent correlation

11

where the null hypothesis of independence is rejected, we test two volatility synchronization
hypothesis: (a) In the first one we test whether, when the “originator country” is in a high
volatility state, the “recipient country” is always in the high volatility state. We call the
behavior under this hypothesis “high volatility synchronization.” (b) In our second test we
inquire whether when the “originator country” is in a low volatility state, the “recipient
country” is always in the low volatility state. We call the behavior under this hypothesis “low
volatility synchronization.”
To test the null hypothesis of independent states, we first estimate a bivariate
SWARCH model, imposing no restriction on the matrix P*. The log likelihood function of the
unrestricted model is denoted as L(HA). We also estimate the model by imposing the
restricted transition probability matrix, P*, with elements such as p14*=p12x p12y. From this
estimation, we keep the log likelihood function of the restricted model, L(H0). Then, we
calculate a Likelihood Ratio test, LR = -2*(L(H0)-L(HA)). Under the null hypothesis, this test
has a χ2 distribution, with k degrees of freedom, where k is given by the number of additional
parameters estimated under the alternative hypothesis.
Figure 6 through 14 display the estimated smooth probabilities corresponding to each
of the four st* states described above. Consider, for example, Figure 6 on Mexico and
Argentina. The first panel presents the probability that both countries are jointly in a low
probability state. The second panel contains the probability of Mexico being in a low state and
Argentina in a high volatility state. Panel 3 corresponds to the probability that Mexico is in a
high volatility state, while Argentina is in a low volatility state. Finally, the fourth panel is the
probability that both countries are in a high volatility state.
Since we are particularly interested in the transmission of high volatility, in the
discussion that follows we focus, mostly, on the fourth panel for each country pair. The results
are quite revealing. While there are several instances that Mexico and Argentina are in a high
volatility state, this only happens after 1994, and it tends to happen only at the time when there
are major international crises . In general, the same behavior is observed for the cases of Mexico
and Brazil (Figure 7), and Mexico and Chile (Figure 9). We interpret these joint high-high
periods as responding to exogenous events (i.e. the Mexican, Asian, Russian and Brazilian
crises) jointly affecting both countries.
coefficient.

12

The estimated smooth probabilities when Honk Kong is the “originator country” are
in Figure 9 through 12 and are also quite interesting. First, and surprisingly perhaps, they show
that Argentina and Honk Kong stock markets jointly experienced a high volatility state –i.e.,
prob(st*=4)>0.5– during a number of periods, going back to 1991. These figures also show that
in the latter part of 1997 –at the time when the East Asian currency crisis was in full swing –
Hong Kong and Argentina were jointly in the high volatility state. Second, these figures also
show that after the attack on the Hong Kong currency board in late October, 1997, Brazil and
Hong Kong experienced short periods of joint high volatility. Throughout 1998, both countries
also experienced joint high-high periods. In contrast, Figures 10 and 11, on Hong-Kong and
Brazil, and Hong Kong and Chile respectively, show that some of the joint states are not very
well defined. These results might indicate that these two pairs might have some structure in the
Markov matrix, which is not well captured by the unconstrained model.
Our bivariate technique can be used to investigate the extent to which Brazil’s
currency crisis of January 1999 spilled-over to its MERCOSUR trading bloc partners, Argentina
and Chile.10 This is an important exercise, since a number of authors have argued that financial
contagion is mostly regional, and is particularly strong across countries that have a close trade
ties. The estimated smooth probabilities for Argentina and Chile, when Brazil is considered to
be the “originator,” are shown in Figure 13 and 14, respectively. These figures show that during
all international crises Brazil, Argentina and Chile share the same high volatility-state.
Interestingly enough, the second state (Brazil low volatility and the other country high
volatility) is not very well defined and does not show persistence.
Tables 5 to 7 summarize the results obtained from the actual estimation of the
bivariate SWARCH models. These tables contain the estimated SWARCH parameters for each
country, state-dependent correlation coefficients, as well as the Likelihood Ratio test for the null
hypothesis that the volatility states are independent across each pair of countries. In Tables 5
and 6, we present the results for Mexico and Brazil, taken as “originator” countries. We find
strong evidence for state dependent correlations with the originator country, especially with
Mexico. In general, our correlation estimates are very close to the ones obtained in the very
recent literature on contagion, see Forbes and Rigobon (1999). The correlation coefficient
between Mexico and the other Latin American markets jumps between two and four times when
10

Argentina is a full member of MERCOSUR; Chile is an associate member.

13

Mexico is in the high volatility state. Forbes and Rigobon (1999) argue that under
heteroscedastic conditions, the estimates of the correlation coefficient in the high volatility state
are biased. The SWARCH model, however, explicitly models heteroscedasticity, and if this is
the correct model, our estimators are maximum likelihood estimates. An important difference
between our analysis and more traditional results, is that we do not use correlation coefficients
to test dependence. Instead our dependence tests are based on the Markov structure of the
Hamilton process, as described above.
According to our results the independence state hypothesis can be rejected for all
Latin American stock markets. For these Latin American cases, we then tested the two null
hypotheses of volatility synchronization discussed above. In Tables 5 and 6, we report these
tests. We reject the “high volatility synchronization” hypothesis, which states that when the
“originator country” is in a high volatility state, the “recipient country” is always in the high
volatility state. With the exception of the Brazil-Argentina pair, we also reject the “low
volatility synchronization” hypothesis. That is, for Argentina and Brazil, we find that when
Brazil is in a stable, low volatility period, Argentina is also in the low volatility period. That is,
the second state is not well defined. This result is consistent with the findings in Figure 13,
where the second state smoothed probabilities do not have a clear economic interpretation. A
natural interpretation of this result is that no-news in Brazil, is good news in Argentina. Overall,
taking into account the economic linkages of Latin American economies, these results point out
to a non-linear interdependence of their stock markets.
In Table 7, we present the results when we take Hong Kong as the “originator
country.” Overall these results suggest low correlations. Notice, however, that the correlations
between Hong Kong and the Latin American countries increase during the periods of high
volatility in Hong Kong. But as argued in Edwards and Susmel (2000) low or zero correlations
do not imply independence. After all, contagion is a non-linear event, difficult to be captured by
a standard correlation coefficient. We find dependence between Hong Kong-Argentina, and
Hong Kong-Mexico. We cannot reject the independence hypothesis between Hong KongBrazil, and Hong Kong and Chile. This result might reflect the existence of capital controls in
both Brazil and Chile during much of the period covered by our analysis. The independence of
the volatility processes of these two pairs might also explain the findings in Figures 10 and 11,

14

where some of the states where not clearly defined. For Hong Kong-Argentina, and Hong
Kong-Mexico, however, we also reject both versions of the synchronization hypothesis. 11
In Table 8, we relax the assumption that correlations change only when the
“originator country” changes its volatility state. We estimate the four-state SWARCH model
allowing for correlations to change across each state. The pattern of increased correlations
during high volatility periods of an originator country, implied by typical contagion stories, is
only observed when Mexico is the originator. When Brazil or Hong Kong are taken as
originators countries, the pattern is not clear. For example, the correlation coefficient between
Argentina and Brazil is significantly (twice or more) higher when both countries are in the low
volatility state. Hong Kong and Chile also have unusual correlation patterns. The correlation
coefficients are the highest when Chile is in the high volatility state. A similar pattern is
observed for Hong Kong and Mexico. These results point out the shortcomings of arbitrarily
splitting the sample and then using the correlation coefficients in the arbitrarily partitioned data
set as a measure of contagion.
V. Concluding Remarks
In this paper we use weekly stock return data for a group of Latin American and Asian
countries to analyze the behavior of volatility through time. For this purpose, we use univariate
and bivariate switching ARCH models. We find strong evidence for state-varying volatility
during the 1990s in Latin American stock markets. The univariate results indicate that highvolatility episodes are, in general, short-lived and tend to be associated with common
international crisis. We then examined the joint behavior of Latin American and Hong Kong
stock returns. We find that Latin American markets have interdependent volatility processes.
When Hong Kong, taken as a representative Asian market, is included in the analysis, Chile and
Brazil show no volatility dependence with that Asian market. In general, we observe strong
dependence among regional lines, especially among the Mercosur countries. With the exception
of Mexico, the correlation coefficients do not show the typical behavior under the contagion
hypothesis. Overall, we interpret our results as being more supportive of interdependence than of
contagion stories.

11

We also tested an even stronger version of the high volatility synchronization hypothesis, the common
states hypothesis. Under this null hypothesis, both countries share the same volatility states. The common
states null hypothesis was rejected in all the cases, with a p-value lower than .0001

Likelihood-independent states: likelihood function for the bivariate SWARCH(2,1) model estimated
imposing independence states between the two series. (LR-independent states represents the likelihood
ratio test, with its p-value in parenthesis).
Likelihood-HV synchronization: likelihood function for the bivariate SWARCH(2,1) model estimated
imposing the high volatility synchronization restriction. (LR-HV synchronization represents the likelihood
ratio test, with its p-value in parenthesis).
Likelihood-LV synchronization: likelihood function for the bivariate SWARCH(2,1) model estimated
imposing the low volatility synchronization restriction. (LR-LV synchronization represents the likelihood
ratio test, with its p-value in parenthesis).
* significant at the 5% level.
+ significantly different than 1 (null hypothesis under no-switching).
++ significantly different state-dependent correlation coefficients (null hypothesis both correlation
coefficients are equal).
