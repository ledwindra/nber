Two factors lead them to be too selective in the job offers that they accept.  The first is an information externality: searchers fail to take into account the value of their experience to others.  The second is an incentive to free ride: each worker would like others to experiment and reveal information concerning productive jobs.  Together these forces imply that in equilibrium the natural rate of unemployment is too high.\n\n",
