ABSTRACT
We study the Rothschild-Stiglitz model of competitive insurance markets with endogenous
information disclosure by both firms and consumers. We show that an equilibrium always exists,
(even without the single crossing property), and characterize the unique equilibrium allocation.
With two types of consumers the outcome is particularly simple, consisting of a pooling
allocation which maximizes the well-being of the low risk individual (along the zero profit
pooling line) plus a supplemental (undisclosed and nonexclusive) contract that brings the high
risk individual to full insurance (at his own odds). We show that this outcome is extremely robust
and Pareto efficient.

Characterization, Existence, and Pareto Optimality in Insurance Markets
with Asymmetric Information with Endogenous and Asymmetric
Disclosures: Revisiting Rothschild-Stiglitz
By JOSEPH E. STIGLITZ, JUNGYOLL YUN, AND ANDREW KOSENKO *
Abstract: We study the Rothschild-Stiglitz model of competitive
insurance markets with endogenous information disclosure by both
firms and consumers. We show that an equilibrium always exists,
(even without the single crossing property), and characterize the
unique equilibrium allocation. With two types of consumers the
outcome is particularly simple, consisting of a pooling allocation
which maximizes the well-being of the low risk individual (along the
zero profit pooling line) plus a supplemental (undisclosed and
nonexclusive) contract that brings the high risk individual to full
insurance (at his own odds). We show that this outcome is extremely
robust and Pareto efficient. (JEL D43, D82, D86)

Some forty years ago, Rothschild and Stiglitz (1976) characterized equilibrium in a
competitive market with exogenous information asymmetries in which market participants had full
knowledge of insurance purchases. Self-selection constraints affected individual choices; but
unlike the monopoly equilibrium 1 , no single firm framed the set of contracts among which
individuals chose. There never existed a pooling equilibrium (in which the two types bought the
same policy); if there existed an equilibrium, it entailed the high risk getting full insurance, and
the low risk individual only getting partial insurance; and under plausible conditions—e.g. if the
two types were not too different—a pure strategy equilibrium did not exist. The paper was
unsatisfactory not only in its results (in reality equilibrium seemed to exist, and often entailed

pooling) but on its reliance on a special property, called the single crossing property, whereby the
indifference curve of the high risk individual could cross that of the low risk individual only once
(if at all). 2
Since their work, there has been huge literature applying the model to labor, capital, and
product markets in a variety of contexts, a large number of empirical applications, and a small
literature trying to repair the deficiencies in the underlying framework by formalizing the insurance
“game”, by changing the information/disclosure assumptions, and by changing the equilibrium
concept.
This paper takes an approach that differs fundamentally from this earlier literature by
endogenizing the disclosure of information about insurance purchases: each firm and consumer
makes a decision about what information to disclose to whom—thus information about contract
purchases is not only endogenous but potentially asymmetric. The results were somewhat
surprising even to us: (i) asymmetries in information about insurance purchases, especially
associated with out of equilibrium moves, do indeed turn out to be important; (ii) there always
exists an equilibrium, even when the single crossing property is not satisfied; and (iii) the
equilibrium always entails a pooling contract.

Indeed, the unique insurance allocation (an

insurance allocation describes the sum of benefits and premia for each individual) consists of the
pooling allocation which maximizes the well-being of the low risk individual (subject to the zeroprofit constraint) plus a supplemental contract that brings the high risk individual to full insurance
(at his own odds). While the equilibrium allocation is unique, it can be supported by alternative
information strategies.
We begin the analysis by characterizing the set of Pareto efficient (PE) allocations in the
presence of a possibly secret contract. We then show that the PE allocation which maximizes the
well-being of the low risk individual is the unique equilibrium allocation and can be supported by
simple information disclosure strategies.
While the analysis is complex, it is built upon a number of steps, each of which itself is
relatively simple. As in RS, insurance firms offer insurance contracts, but now they may or may
not decide to reveal information (all or partial) about insurance purchases to other firms. In RS, it
was assumed that contracts were exclusive, e.g. implicitly, that if a firm discovered a purchaser

As innocuous as it might seem, it won’t be satisfied if the high and low risk individuals differ in their risk aversion;
and with multi-crossings, equilibrium, if it exists, can look markedly different.

had violated the exclusivity restriction, the coverage would be cancelled. Here, we consider a
broader range of possible restrictions. Obviously, the enforceability of any conditions imposed is
dependent on information available to the insurance firm. Consumers, too, have a slightly more
complicated life than in RS: they have to decide which policies to buy, aware of the restrictions
in place and the information that the insurance firm may have to enforce those restrictions. And
they also have to decide on what information to reveal to whom 3.
As in RS, a competitive equilibrium is described by a set of insurance contracts, such that no
one can offer an alternative contract or set of contracts and make money. Here, though, a contract
is defined not just by the benefit and the premium, but also by the restrictions associated with the
contract and the firm’s disclosure policy.
The paper is divided into 12 sections. In the first, we set out the standard insurance model. In
the second we recall why RS resorted to exclusive contracts. We explain how the existence of a
(non-loss making) secret contract offered at the odds of the high risk individual (a) upsets the
separating equilibrium; (b) implies that some of the contracts that broke the pooling contract no
longer do so; but (c) there always exist some contracts that nevertheless break the relevant pooling
allocation. Section 3 then shows that if there is a non-disclosed contract (at the odds of the high
risk individual), the Pareto efficient contracts are always of a simple form: pooling plus
supplemental insurance purchased only by high risk individuals. Section 4 then defines the
competitive equilibrium. Section 5 shows that regardless of the strategies, if there is a competitive
equilibrium, the allocation must be the Pareto efficient allocation which maximizes the wellbeing
of the low risk individual. Section 6 then describes equilibrium strategies for firms and consumers,
shows that the posited strategies support the equilibrium allocation described in the previous
section, and are robust against any deviant contract. Section 7 comments on several salient
properties of the result and its proof, including that it does not require the single crossing property,
but only a much weaker condition. Section 8 and 9 discuss uniqueness of equilibria and show how
the equilibrium construct can be extended, for instance to other disclosure strategies and to
multiple types of individuals. Sections 10 and 11 relate our results to earlier literature. In
particular, section 11 considers the standard adverse selection price equilibrium. We show how

3

We assume that consumers can only reveal information to firms, and not to other consumers. Since the game is one
of private values, revealing information to other consumers is moot, and therefore we disallow it without loss of
generality.

3

our analysis implies that in general a price equilibrium does not exist if there can exist a (non-loss
making) insurance contract the purchase of which is not disclosed. Section 12 presents some
concluding comments.
1. The model
We employ the standard insurance model with adverse selection. An individual is faced with the
risk of an accident with some probability, Pi . Pi depends upon the type i of the individual. There

are two types of individuals – high risk and low-risk-- who differ from each other only in the
probability of accident. The type is privately known to the individual, while the portion 𝜃𝜃 of high-

risk type is common knowledge. The average probability of accident for an individual is 𝑃𝑃�, where
𝑃𝑃� ≡ 𝜃𝜃𝑃𝑃𝐻𝐻 + (1 − 𝜃𝜃)𝑃𝑃𝐿𝐿 .

An accident involves damages. The cost of repairing the damage in full is d. An insurance firm
pays a part of the repair cost, α ≤ d. The benefit is paid in the event of accident, whereas the

insurer is paid insurance premium β when no accident occurs. 4 The price of insurance, q, is defined
by

β

α

. (In market equilibrium, the amount of insurance that an individual can buy may be limited.)

The expected utility for an individual with a contract (α, β) is
Vi (α, β) = Pi U(w − d + α) + (1 − Pi )U(w − β)

(1)

where the Bernoulli utility function U is quasi-concave and differentiable, with U” < 0 (individuals
are risk averse). Sometimes we refer to a contract A ≡ {α, β}, in which case we can refer to the
expected utility generated by that contract as Vi{A} 5. Under (1), an indifference curve for a highrisk individual is steeper than that for a low-risk one at any (α, β), thus satisfying the so-called

single-crossing property. As will be shown later in the paper, however, we can allow for more
general preferences, e.g. with a different utility function 𝑈𝑈𝑖𝑖 (. )for each type i. 6 In this case, the

single crossing property will not necessarily be satisfied. The key property of Vi (α, β) is that the
𝑃𝑃

income consumption curve at the insurance price 1−𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖 is the full insurance line, 7 implying that at
𝑖𝑖

full insurance, the slope of the indifference curve equals the relative probabilities,

This has become the standard formulation since RS. In practice, customers pay β the period before the (potential)
accident, receiving back α + β in the event the accident occurs, i.e. a net receipt of α.
5
Similarly, if the individual purchases policies A and B, we can refer to the expected utility generated as Vi {A + B}.
6
Indeed, we do not even require preferences to satisfy the conditions required for behavior towards risk to be described
by expected utility. We also do not even require quasi-concavity.

That is even if the indifference curve is not quasi concave, after being tangent to a given isocline with slope 𝑖𝑖 ,

so that will full information, equilibrium would entail full insurance for each type at their own
odds. We retain this key assumption throughout the paper. There are N firms and the identity of a
firm j is represented by j, where j = 1,--, N. The profit 𝜋𝜋𝑖𝑖 of a contract (α, β) that is chosen by i-

type (i=H,L) is 𝜋𝜋𝑖𝑖 (α, β) = (1 − 𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖 )𝛽𝛽 − 𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖 𝛼𝛼 . 𝜋𝜋𝑖𝑖 (α, β) = 0 is defined as the ith type’s zero profit

locus. Figure 1 illustrates the zero-profit locus for a firm selling insurance to an i-type or both

2. Rothschild-Stiglitz with secret contracts
Central to the analysis of Rothschild and Stiglitz was the assumption that there was sufficient
information to enforce exclusivity; the individual could not buy insurance from more than one firm.
As RS realized, once we introduce into the RS analysis unobservable contracts in addition to the
observable ones, the whole RS framework collapses. Exclusivity cannot be enforced. In this
section, we review why they assumed exclusivity. We assume that undisclosed contracts can and
will be offered if they at least break-even. In particular, we know that a price contract (where the
𝑃𝑃

individual can buy as much of the given insurance at the given price) with a price 1−𝑃𝑃𝐻𝐻 will at least

break even: if it is bought by any low risk individual, it makes a profit.

𝐻𝐻

Breaking a separating equilibrium. When there is secret supplemental insurance, the implicit
self-selection constraints change, because whether an individual prefers contract A rather B
depends on whether an individual prefers A plus the optimally chosen secret contract to B plus the
optimally chosen secret contract. Thus, in figure 1, with secret contracts, the high risk individual
𝑃𝑃

prefers the contract which puts him on the highest isocline line with slope 1−𝑃𝑃𝐻𝐻 .
𝐻𝐻

Consider the standard RS equilibrium separating contracts, C and B. C is the full insurance

contract for the high risk individual assuming he was not subsidized or taxed and B is the contract
on the low risk individual’s break-even curve (the zero-profit locus defined above) that just
separates, i.e. is not purchased by the high risk individual. 8 {B, C} can never be an equilibrium if
there can be undisclosed contracts, because if there were a secret offer of a supplemental contract
at a price reflecting the “odds” of the high risk individual, then the high risk individuals would buy
B plus supplemental insurance bringing him to C’. 9 B and C no longer separate. (Later, we show
that there is in fact no alternative set of separating observed contracts.)
Breaking a pooling equilibrium with no disclosure of deviant policy. RS showed that there
could be no pooling equilibrium by showing that because of the single crossing property, there
always exists contracts preferred by the low risk individual and not by the high risk which lie
below the pooling zero profit line and above the low risk zero profit line. But the ability to
supplement the breaking contract may make the contracts which broke the pooling equilibrium,

8

In RS, the pair of contracts {B, C} constitutes the equilibrium so long as B is preferred to the contract on the pooling
line which is most preferred by the low risk individual. If this is not true, there exists no equilibrium.

This result follows directly from the fact that the implicit price of B is 𝐿𝐿 < 𝐻𝐻 .

under the assumption of no hidden contracts, attractive to the high risk individual. Such a contract
cannot break the pooling equilibrium.

Figure 2 provides an illustration. The pooling contract A* is the most preferred policy of the low
𝑃𝑃�

risk type along the pooling line with slope 1−𝑃𝑃� , 10 the only possible pooling equilibrium. Consider
the high-risk price line through A*. The high risk individual also purchases the insurance contract

A*, thereby obtaining a subsidy from the low risk individual, and supplements it with secret
insurance at the high risk odds (represented in Figure 2 by A*C*, where C* is the full insurance

Sometimes referred to as the Wilson equilibrium. Obviously, any other posited pooling equilibrium could be broken
by A*, since it would be purchased by all the low risk individuals.

point along the line through A* with slope 1−𝑃𝑃𝐻𝐻 .) 11 Consider a policy Do below the low risk
𝐻𝐻

individual’s indifference curve through A*, above that for the high risk individual, and which also

lies below the zero profit line for high risk individuals through A*. In the RS analysis, with
exclusivity, Do would have broken the pooling equilibrium A*. Now, it does not, because the high
risk individuals would buy Do and the (secret) supplemental insurance. 12 And if they do so, then
Do makes a loss, and so Do could not break the pooling equilibrium.
But the question is, are there any policies which could be offered that would break the pooling
equilibrium, that would be taken up by the low risk individuals, but not by the high risk individuals
even if they could supplement the contract with a secret contract breaking even. The answer is yes.
There are policies which lie below the zero profit pooling line and above the zero profit line for
low risk individuals (that is, would make a profit if purchased only by low risk individuals), below
the low risk individual’s indifference curve (i.e. are preferred by low risk individuals), and lie
above the high-risk zero profit line through A* (i.e. even if the high risk individual could have
secretly supplemented his purchases with insurance at his actuarial fair odds, he would be worse
off than simply purchasing A*). These policies break the pooling contract. In Figure 2, any point
(such as D) in the shaded area in the figure, which we denote by z, can thus break the pooling
equilibrium. The set z is not empty because the low risk individual’s indifference curve is tangent
to the pooling line at A*. 13

Formally, for any point such as D, 𝑉𝑉𝐿𝐿 {𝐷𝐷} > 𝑉𝑉𝐿𝐿 {𝐴𝐴∗ } , while

𝑉𝑉𝐻𝐻 {𝐷𝐷 + 𝑆𝑆𝐻𝐻 } > 𝑉𝑉𝐻𝐻 {𝐴𝐴∗ }. 14 We collect the results together in

Proposition 1.

11

Recall that at full insurance, the slope of the indifference curve of the high risk individual is just

𝑃𝑃𝐻𝐻

1−𝑃𝑃𝐻𝐻

, and full

insurance entails α = d − β.
12
This is different from the way that the matter was framed by Wilson and Riley, who described the policy A as being
withdrawn when a policy such as Do is offered (which is why their equilibrium concepts are typically described as
reactive). Here, when Do is offered, A* is not withdrawn, but nonetheless, because of the secret contract, high risk
individuals prefer Do to A*. See the fuller discussion in the next sections.
13
Of course, if the offer of the deviant contract were public, sellers of contract A* could make their offer conditional
on there not being a contract in z being offered, in which any such contract would lose money. This is in the spirit of
the reactive Wilson equilibrium, which in turn is not in the spirit of competitive equilibrium. However, here, firms
can chose not to disclose either their offer of insurance or individual’s purchase of insurance. (The assumption of
non-disclosure of offers is not fully satisfactory in the context of market insurance, since if consumers know about a
firm selling insurance, presumably so could other insurance firms. But in fact much insurance is non-market insurance
(see Arnott and Stiglitz (1991b)), often implicit and not formal, and whether such insurance is available to any
individual let alone taken up by him may not be known.
14
The notation 𝐷𝐷 + 𝑆𝑆𝐻𝐻 refers to the {α, β} associated with the purchase of D plus the optimized value of secret
insurance along the price line associated with the high risk individual. Given our assumptions about preferences, we
know this brings the high risk individual to full insurance.

8

(a) The RS Separating Contracts do not constitute an equilibrium, if firms can offer non-loss
making undisclosed contracts.
(b) The pooling equilibrium may always be “broken” if there exists undisclosed supplemental
insurance and if a deviant firm can choose to keep his offers secret.
(c) Some of the contracts that broke the pooling equilibrium in the standard RS equilibrium
with exclusivity no longer do so.
The remaining sections focus on the core issue of an endogenous information structure, with
the simultaneous determination of contract offers of firms and with contract purchases and
information disclosure by individual customers.
3. Pareto efficiency with undisclosed contracts
In this section, we consider the set of efficient insurance allocations under the premise that there
exists a secret (undisclosed) contract being offered at the price

𝑃𝑃𝐻𝐻

1−𝑃𝑃𝐻𝐻

. We can think of this as a

“constrained P.E.” allocation—where the constraint is that the government cannot proscribe the
secret provision of insurance, unlike the PE allocations associated with the RS model, where
government could restrain such provision. 15 The difficulties in defining Pareto efficiency in
settings of incomplete information are not new 16 ; we use the following ex-interim variant of
constrained Pareto efficiency 17:
Definition 1. An allocation E = {(𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 , 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖 )}𝑖𝑖 is constrained Pareto-efficient if the government cannot
force disclosure and there does not exist another feasible allocation (i.e. one which at least breaks
even), and leaves each type of consumer as well off and at least one type strictly better off.
For simplicity of exposition, in this section we assume that the assumptions leading to
expression (1) are satisfied. We now establish two general properties that a PE allocation must
satisfy:
Lemma 1. Every Pareto efficient allocation must be a separating allocation (i.e. one where the
two types of individuals get different allocations), except possibly for the point along the pooling
line providing full insurance.
Any feasible (i.e. making at least zero profit for the firms) pooling allocation must lie on the

15
The analysis of PE allocations in the RS model is in Stiglitz (2009). The terminology may be confusing. It focuses
on the constraints imposed by the government—that it cannot restrict the secret sale of insurance. From the perspective
of the market, of course, it is an “unconstrained” equilibrium—they do not face the constraint of disclosing.

pooling line. At any point other than full insurance, the utility of the high risk individual will be
improved by a pair of allocations (𝐴𝐴∗ and 𝐶𝐶 ∗ in Figure 3, for example), that along the pooling line
and that bringing the high risk individual to full insurance from there.

Lemma 2. Every Pareto efficient allocation must entail full insurance for high-risk individuals.
This follows directly from our assumptions on V, quasi-concavity and that at full insurance,

It should be clear that these are sufficient conditions. All that is required, as noted above, is that the income
𝑃𝑃
consumption curve at the insurance price 𝐻𝐻 is the full insurance line. A sufficient condition for this are the
restrictions set forth for (1).

Also, define 𝐶𝐶 ∗ as a full-insurance point along the line through 𝐴𝐴∗ with slope 1−𝑃𝑃𝐻𝐻 , which can be
represented as an allocation (𝛼𝛼𝐻𝐻∗ , 𝛽𝛽𝐻𝐻∗ ) such that
𝛼𝛼𝐻𝐻∗ + 𝛽𝛽𝐻𝐻∗ = d, and 𝛽𝛽𝐻𝐻∗ − 𝛽𝛽̅ =

Consider contract pairs {A’, C’} in figure 3 where A’ lies along the pooling line and C’ is the full

(𝛼𝛼𝐻𝐻′ − 𝛼𝛼�′)

(5)

All such pairs are feasible outcomes. Then for an allocation {A’, C’} such that 𝛼𝛼�′ < 𝛼𝛼�, an increase

in insurance improves the utility of both the high and low risk individuals, so such allocations
cannot be PE. Consider now a contract pair {A’, C’} such that 𝛼𝛼� ′ > 𝛼𝛼� as in Figure 3. Given C’

and the existence of secret contract, is there an alternative feasible allocation preferred by low risk

individuals? Any contract purchases just by low risk individuals must lie on or above the line
𝑃𝑃

through A’ with slope 1−𝑃𝑃𝐿𝐿 , because otherwise it is not feasible; and on or above the line through
𝑃𝑃

𝐿𝐿

A’ with slope 1−𝑃𝑃𝐻𝐻 , because otherwise it would be chosen by both the high risk and low risk
individual.

𝐻𝐻

The only contract satisfying these two conditions is A’. On the other hand, any

feasible contract purchased by both types must lie along the pooling line. Along the pooling line,
any allocation that makes the low risk individual better off (by moving towards 𝐴𝐴∗ ) makes the high

risk individual worse off. Quasi-concavity of the indifference curves ensures that the low risk
individual’s indifference curve through A’ has a slope that is steeper than

. Hence, there exists

no Pareto improvement over {A’,C’}. We have thus fully characterized the set of Pareto efficient

4. Definition of market equilibrium

11

In this section, we define the market equilibrium.
4-1. Contract Offers by Firms and Optimal Responses by Consumers
Firms move first, making a set of contract offers. 19 A contract 𝐶𝐶𝑘𝑘 (= {𝛼𝛼𝑘𝑘 , 𝛽𝛽𝑘𝑘 , 𝑅𝑅𝑘𝑘 , 𝐷𝐷𝑘𝑘 }) offered by

a firm k is represented by a benefit 𝛼𝛼𝑘𝑘 , if the accident occurs, a premium 𝛽𝛽𝑘𝑘 , if it does not, a set

𝑅𝑅𝑘𝑘 of restrictions that have to be met for the purchase of (𝛼𝛼𝑘𝑘 , 𝛽𝛽𝑘𝑘 ), and a rule 𝐷𝐷𝑘𝑘 of disclosing

information at the firm’s disposal, such as about (𝛼𝛼𝑘𝑘 , 𝛽𝛽𝑘𝑘 ) sold to individual i. The restrictions 𝑅𝑅𝑘𝑘 ,

to be relevant, must be based on observables, i.e. what is revealed to the insurance firm k either by
the insured i or by other insurance firms; and we assume that they relate only to the purchases of
insurance by the insured; they may entail, for instance, a minimum or maximum amount of
insurance obtained from others. The exclusivity provision of RS is an example of a restriction, but
there are obviously many potential others.
Two simple disclosure rules would be to disclose the purchase to every other firm, or to
disclose the purchase to no firm. The equilibrium disclosure rules to be described below will turn
out to be somewhat more complex than these simple rules, but still relatively simple.
Following this, households look at the set of contracts on offer (including the restrictions and
disclosure policies) and choose the set of contracts that maximizes their expected utility, given the
contract constraints.
Consumers also have an information revelation strategy, e.g. what information (about their
purchases) to disclose to whom, taking into consideration disclosure policies and contract offers
firms announce. In the central model of this paper, the individual simply reveals the quantity of
pooling insurance purchased to those firms from whom he has purchased a pooling contract. In
an alternative formulation described briefly in Appendix C, he also tells the price at which he has
purchased insurance. Of course, firms anticipate their responses—both their purchases and
disclosures.
There is a third period which just entails the “working out” of the consequences of the first
two—no new action is taken. The third period takes place in two stages. In the first, firms disclose
information according to the disclosure rules they announced.

In the second, based upon

information received from the consumer and from other firms, each firm checks to see whether
any contract restriction is violated, and if it is, that policy is cancelled. Actually, life is easier than

19

The firm knows nothing about the individual, other than information about contract purchases. The firm may make
inferences about the individual based on the information it has about his purchases.

12

just described: Since consumers who always respond optimally to any set of contracts offered by
firms know that if they violate contract provisions, policies will be cancelled 20; and in this model,
there is no strategic value of buying policies which will be cancelled. 21 Hence, no policies are
cancelled. . 22
4.2. Information Disclosure
As we noted, both consumers and firms disclose information on the contracts they have purchased
and sold. We assume that both can withhold information from others. 23 The firm or the consumer
can disclose just the amount of insurance (α) or the price or β. Also, as a means of partial revelation
of information, a firm might engage in what we call contract manipulation (CM) – dividing its
sales to an individual into multiple policies. This would allow a consumer to disclose to others
one policy, but to hide the full extent of his insurance purchases from that particular firm. As will
be shown below, however, no firm sells an individual multiple contracts in equilibrium, so that no
CM occurs in equilibrium.
Suppressing i for notational simplicity, we denote by the total information about i of firm k by
Ω𝑘𝑘 . It consists of the information revealed to firm k by consumer i, denoted by Ω𝑐𝑐𝑘𝑘 ; the other

firms, denoted by Ω𝑘𝑘 ; and the information 𝐶𝐶𝑘𝑘 it has directly on i from its own sales.

The

information disclosure rule 𝐷𝐷𝑘𝑘 of a contract specifies what information about individual i firm k

reveals to firm j. We assume that the information revealed by firm k about i is a subset of the
information Ω𝑐𝑐𝑘𝑘 that the firm has on individual i obtained from individual i and the information

about its own sale to the individual, 𝐶𝐶𝑘𝑘 . The decision as to whom to disclose is based upon the
same information.. The disclosure rule of firm k can thus be represented by 𝐷𝐷𝑘𝑘 (Ω𝑐𝑐𝑘𝑘 ; 𝐶𝐶𝑘𝑘 )24. Firms

20

So that no policy is cancelled even out-of-equilibrium as well as in equilibrium.

21

This is not a repeated game. Consumers are engaging in a “rational expectations best response strategy,” which
includes identifying which deceptions are caught out, and since such policies are cancelled, not undertaking them
22
Even in any of the potential out-of-equilibrium moves that seemingly might “break” the equilibrium, there is only
consequential information revelation by firms to the deviant firm, since as we show later, no individual purchases
from the “established” firms more than 𝛼𝛼�. In some of the variants of the model that we have explored, firms base
their disclosures (both about what to disclose and who to disclose) on information that they receive from other firms.
In that case, the third stage is broken into two substages, in the first of which there is sequential revelation of
information. It is easy to show that there are a finite number of sequential rounds. As we have explained, our
objective in this paper is to show that there is a simple set of strategies that support the equilibrium allocation.
23
We assume agents cannot lie; a consumer or his insurer cannot “reveal” that he purchased insurance from a firm
when no such purchase happened. In short, they tell the truth, nothing but the truth, but not necessarily the whole truth.
We do not analyze the game where firms are free to engage in strategic disinformation. We do allow a contract to be
shown with redacted information (the truth, but not the whole truth.)
24

Note that, as contrasted with Jaynes (1978) and Hellwig (1988), the disclosure rule of a firm is not conditional

13

can engage in discriminatory revelation, revealing information to some firms not revealed to
others, thus creating an asymmetry of information about the insurance coverage of any individual.
If there is discriminatory disclosure, the discrimination has to be based on some information Ω𝑐𝑐𝑘𝑘
previously disclosed by the insured to the firm. 25
4.3. Equilibrium
Our equilibrium definition is a straightforward generalization of that of RS, where a set of contracts
was an equilibrium if there did not exist another contract (or set of contracts) which could be
introduced, be purchased by someone, and make a profit (or at least break even.) Here, contracts
are defined by the quadruplet {α, β, R, D}. We denote the set of contract offers of firm k by
strategy 𝑆𝑆𝑘𝑘 .

Definition (Equilibrium). An equilibrium is a strategy 𝑆𝑆𝑘𝑘∗ for each firm k, such that, given the set

{𝑆𝑆𝑘𝑘∗ }𝑘𝑘 of strategies adopted by other firms, there does not exist any other strategy that firm j can
adopt to increase its profits, once consumers optimally respond to any sets of strategies announced
by firms. 26
Firms In Rothschild-Stiglitz, each firm offered only one insurance contract. It turned out that
some of the results were sensitive to this somewhat artificial restriction. The results established
here do not require that the firm offer a single contract, but the proofs are greatly simplified if we
restrict the set of contracts it can offer all to have the same price. In appendix D, we establish the
results for the more general case. The set of contracts offered can be discrete, or the firm may offer
a continuum of contracts, e.g. any amount of insurance up to some upper bound at a price q.
As the restrictions and the disclosure rules that can be specified by a contract may in general
be complex, the strategy space for a firm may also be quite complex. We impose no constraints
on the set of restrictions or disclosure rules the firm can employ. Our purpose, however, is to show
that there is a simple strategy that supports the equilibrium allocation, and thus we do not need to
consider the most general strategy space possible. 27 We assume that the only information that k
takes into account in deciding what information about i to reveal to which other firms is

upon contract offers made by other firms.
25
We do not consider random disclosures.
26
We formulate the model with a fixed number of firms, so the deviation occurs on the part of one of those firms. But
we could as well have allowed free entry. Note too that the optimal responses of consumers includes responses both
about contract choices and disclosures.
27
The equilibrium we propose is robust to any deviant contract with any restriction or with any information
disclosure strategy, including those that are outside of the restricted strategy space.

14

information about purchases of contracts by i. 28 We will focus upon a set of disclosure rules that
may discriminate in whom to disclose to but that disclose the same information to all the firms for
whom there is disclosure.
The disclosure rule in the key theorem will disclose only quantities purchased, and only to
those for whom the firm has no information from the consumer that there has been an insurance
purchase. In the appendix C, we consider an alternative disclosure rule, disclosing price as well
as quantity purchased, which supports the same equilibrium allocation.
One last word about the equilibrium concept - the main point in which our model differs from
previous work is strategic information disclosure by consumers. Our equilibrium is of the standard
form where firms assume consumers react to what they do with their best response, which in this
case entails not just the standard response of the choice of contracts, but also information
revelation. 29
5. Equilibrium allocations
In this section, we show that the only possible equilibrium allocation is E* ≡{A*,C*}, the PE
allocation in the presence of undisclosed insurance which maximizes the well-being of the low
risk individual. This is true regardless of the strategies of various firms. The analysis is based
simply on showing that for any other posited equilibrium allocation, it is possible for an entrant to
attract all of the (low risk) consumers and make a profit; hence that allocation could not be an
equilibrium allocation.
The result is almost trivial: assume that there were some other allocation, generated by any set
of contracts purchased from any array of insurance firms, that was not PE. Then there exists a
contract A” that a deviant firm could offer (entailing equal or more insurance than A*), selling
only one policy to each individual, which would at least break even and be purchased by all

28

This restriction has no consequences. The central theorem established later that all equilibrium allocations must be
of a particular form holds regardless of the information strategies. We observe later too that that allocation can be
supported by multiple information strategies within this restricted set of strategies. It can be shown that these
equilibrium strategies are robust in the sense that if the restriction were dropped, it would not pay any firm to adopt a
strategy that was in the less restricted strategy space. We have not investigated whether there exist still other
information strategies that support the equilibrium allocation within the more general unrestricted set of strategies.
29
There are alternative formulations in which consumer information disclosure strategies are incorporated into
the equilibrium definition, i.e. every agent’s strategy (whether consumer or firm) is optimal, given the strategy of all
other agents. Such a formulation does not add anything substantive to the analysis, yet makes it considerably more
complicated and thus, for reasons of brevity and clarity, we use the definition in the text. See Jaynes (2011).

individuals, with high risk individuals supplementing that contract with secret insurance to bring
the high risk individual to full insurance. The putative equilibrium can easily be broken.
Now assume an equilibrium with a PE allocation other than 𝐸𝐸 ∗ . Then a firm could offer a

contract A*, and it would be taken up only by the low risk individual, and so would be profitable.
Notice that these results hold regardless of the strategies of incumbent firms. We have thus far
established the following theorem:
Theorem 1: There exists a unique allocation 𝐸𝐸 ∗ that an equilibrium, if it exists, has to implement.

6. Equilibrium

In establishing the existence of an equilibrium, we will first introduce a posited equilibrium
strategy 𝑆𝑆𝑘𝑘∗ and then prove that it supports the equilibrium allocation described above and that it

is resilient against any deviancy. We assume that there are a set of firms, k = M+1, -- ,N, that sell
𝑃𝑃

the secret contracts at price 𝑞𝑞𝐻𝐻 (= 1−𝑃𝑃𝐻𝐻 ). Their strategy is simply to sell to anyone any amount of
𝐻𝐻

insurance at the price qH, without disclosing their sales to anyone.

We now describe the firm strategies 𝑆𝑆𝑘𝑘∗ for the remaining firms, which we refer to as the
𝑃𝑃�

established firms. (a) They each offer insurance at the pooling price 𝑞𝑞� (= 1−𝑃𝑃�) with (b) the

restriction 𝑅𝑅𝑘𝑘∗ that no individual is allowed to purchase in total (so far as they know) more than 𝛼𝛼,
the amount of insurance that maximizes the welfare of the low risk individual, i.e.,𝛼𝛼𝑘𝑘 + ∑𝑗𝑗≠𝑘𝑘 𝛼𝛼�𝑗𝑗

≤ 𝛼𝛼�, where 𝛼𝛼𝑘𝑘 is the amount of pooling insurance to be purchased from firm k while 𝛼𝛼�𝑗𝑗 is the
amount of pooling insurance revealed by an individual to have been purchased from firm j . If an
individual is revealed to the kth firm to have purchased more than this, the 𝑘𝑘 𝑡𝑡ℎ firm cancels his

policy. (c) Their information disclosure rule 𝐷𝐷𝑘𝑘∗ is equally simple: they disclose everything they
know about the levels of insurance purchases by individual i to every firm which has not been
disclosed to them by individual i as selling insurance to him, and disclose nothing to any firm
which has been disclosed by individual i to have sold insurance to him.
Several features of the equilibrium strategy 𝑆𝑆𝑘𝑘∗ are worth noting. First, it is conditional only

upon the revealed amount 𝛼𝛼�𝑗𝑗 of insurance, not upon the revealed price 𝛽𝛽�𝑗𝑗 of insurance. 30 Second,
it does not entail any latent strategy, that is a strategy that is implemented only in an out-of-

30

The fact that insurance sales are conditional on the sales of other firms does not mean that this is a reactive
equilibrium. As we noted earlier, in the reactive equilibrium, e.g. of Wilson, offers of insurance are withdrawn when
any other firm makes a particular offer.

16

equilibrium state. Third, the strategy entails differential information disclosure based upon
consumer-disclosed information. This is critical in sustaining an equilibrium. Without consumer
disclosure in the model, it would be impossible for any Nash disclosure strategy to entail
differential information disclosure. 31 And without differential information disclosure, it is
impossible to sustain the equilibrium with the pooling contract (which we will refer to in short as
the pooling equilibrium 32 ). There has to be some information disclosure to prevent high risk
individuals “over-purchasing” the pooling contract. But with full information disclosure (of
purchases of pooling contracts), exclusivity can be enforced, and hence the pooling equilibrium
can always be broken. We will further emphasize below the importance of asymmetric information
disclosure both in implementing 𝐸𝐸 ∗ and sustaining it against any deviancy.

In showing that the equilibrium strategy 𝑆𝑆𝑘𝑘∗ implements 𝐸𝐸 ∗ , we first prove the following lemma:

Lemma 3 In equilibrium, no firm sells more than one contract to an individual.

Lemma 3 implies that there is no contract manipulation in equilibrium. Note first that no low-risk
individual would prefer to have multiple contracts from his insurer rather than a single contract, as
he purchases the most preferred amount of pooling insurance in equilibrium. It is only high-risk
individuals who may want to have multiple contracts from their insurers in order to under report
their purchases to other potential insurers, to enable them to purchase more pooling insurance.
Knowing this, no firm would offer its customer more than one contract without charging a price
at least equal to

𝑃𝑃𝐻𝐻

1−𝑃𝑃𝐻𝐻

. But high risk individuals would not accept it because they are at least as
𝑃𝑃

well of purchasing secret insurance at the price 1−𝑃𝑃𝐻𝐻 .
𝐻𝐻

33
32F

Given Lemma 3, we can show that consumers’ best response to 𝑆𝑆𝑘𝑘∗ consists of no individual

buying more than 𝛼𝛼 ,which in turn implies that all purchase just 𝛼𝛼.

Lemma 4. With the equilibrium strategy 𝑆𝑆𝑘𝑘∗ , no individual purchases more than 𝛼𝛼 from the

established firms.

While a formal proof is given in Appendix A, the intuition is clear. Assume he did. He either fully
discloses that he did or does not. If he discloses fully, then given 𝑆𝑆𝑘𝑘∗ all the insurance contracts
31

See also Hellwig (1988).
Recognizing at the same time that it is different from the RS or Wilson pooling equilibrium; with the secret
contracts, the two groups obtain different amounts of insurance.
33
Of course, high risk individuals (or their insurance firms) do not reveal their purchases of the supplemental policies
at the high risk price, because if they did so, then all those selling pooling contracts would condition their sales on
such supplemental policies not being bought (for such purchases reveal that the individual is high risk).
32

17

will be cancelled. So he would not disclose. If he does not disclose some contract, say with firm
j, then under 𝑆𝑆𝑘𝑘∗ , all the other firms disclose to j their sales, and j cancels its policy. But the

individual would have known that, and so would not have purchased that policy. The one subtlety
is the following: Consider a situation with three established firms, A, B, and C. The high risk

individual buys ½ 𝛼𝛼 from each, discloses its purchases from C to A, from B to C and from A to B.

Then A reveals its sales to the individual to B, but B already knew about it, and so on for the others.
This is where our assumption that the individual firm reveals all of the information at his disposal,
not just his direct sales, becomes relevant. A knows about C as well as about its own sales, and
thus reveals to B information about C. But then B knows about j’s purchases from A, B, and C,
i.e. he knows that j has purchased 3/2 𝛼𝛼, and the policy is cancelled. In the appendix, we show

that this logic is perfectly general. 34 We now prove

Theorem 2: The equilibrium strategy 𝑆𝑆𝑘𝑘∗ implements the equilibrium allocation 𝐸𝐸 ∗ . An equilibrium
always exists.

The formal proof can be found in Appendix B. The key challenge in formulating the
equilibrium strategy was suggested by section 2. With full disclosure (exclusive contracts) one
can break any pooling equilibrium. The pooling contract 𝐴𝐴∗ in Figure 2 is sold to both high and

low risk individuals, and if it is to be part of the equilibrium it can’t be broken. We already
established that the only contracts which can break 𝐴𝐴∗ are those in the area labelled z in Figure 2.

But if the “established” firms sell to any individual buying such a contract (such as D in Figure 2)
a supplemental contract bringing him out of the area z (following the arrow in Figure 2), then
breaking the pooling equilibrium would lose money.
Given the strategies of all the established firms, they have on offer pooling contracts up to

𝛼𝛼. High risk individuals will supplement their purchase of the deviant contract by the pooling
34

We have investigated alternative specifications of our model, where a firm discloses just its own sale to its customer,
not what the consumer reveals to it. One variant entails insurance being purchased sequentially, with sales at any
point being conditional on previous purchases. In this setting, a consumer would reveal to his insurer k all of his
previous purchases. Consider a consumer who wishes to hide his purchases because revealing that information would
lead to the cancellation of the policy just purchased. If the consumer does not reveal his purchase say from insurer k’
to k, insurer k will disclose its sale to the previous insurer(s) that were undisclosed to it, who will cancel its policy
sold to the consumer. The only reason that the consumer would not reveal previous purchases was because it had
purchased more than 𝛼𝛼. That is, in this model, a firm does not need to disclose what its customer reveals to it to
prevent its customer from over-purchasing insurance at 𝑞𝑞�. Also, another formulation that requires a firm to disclose
just its sale (but both the quantity of insurance and the price at which it is sold) is a model where firms condition their
contract offers upon price information (as well as quantity) revealed by consumers (see Appendix C).

18

contract, and in doing so will find the deviant contract attractive. But if the high risk individuals
buy the deviant contract, it loses money.
Observe that the deviant contract D either assumes exclusivity (or some restriction to ensure
that the individual does not buy enough insurance to take him out of the area z) or does not. The
deviant firm knows that given 𝑆𝑆𝑘𝑘∗ , if he does not impose contract restrictions, individuals will buy
up to 𝛼𝛼, moving him out of the area z. Hence, the deviant firm will impose restrictions that attempt

to keep its customer from purchasing more than 𝛼𝛼 in the aggregate. But the consumer knows that

the deviant firm cannot enforce those restrictions if the deviant firm doesn’t know about his
purchases; and he knows that, given the information disclosure rule of (the established) firms, if
he reveals his purchases of insurance from the deviant firm to those from whom he has purchased
insurance, the firms will not reveal that information. This will be the case regardless of any
information disclosure rule the deviant firm adopts.

Accordingly, the high risk individual

purchases the deviant contract and pooling contracts up to 𝛼𝛼 and reveals his purchase of the deviant

contract to the sellers of the pooling contract, but not vice versa. He thus moves himself out of the
area z, and his new package of policies yields a higher level of utility than the original allocation,
regardless of any restriction or any information disclosure policy a deviant firm adopts. Hence the
deviant contract loses money and the argument is complete. 35
There is one subtlety that has to be addressed: what happens if the deviant firm offers a menu
of policies, in particular one purchased by high risk individuals, the other by low risk individuals?
Is it possible that such a pair of policies—with cross subsidization—could break the equilibrium?
In Appendix D, we show that, even when a deviant firm offers multiple contracts at different
prices, there still exists an equilibrium.
7. Generality of the Result
The existence of equilibrium does not require the single crossing property to be satisfied. First of
all, it should be obvious that Theorem 1 on the unique equilibrium allocation can hold for more
general preferences so long as the income consumption curve for high-risk individuals
corresponding to q = 𝑞𝑞𝐻𝐻 is the full-insurance line.
35

This will also be true even when a deviant firm is an entrant firm to whom the established firms never disclose
their information. This is because then a high-risk consumer would like to choose the entrant contract all the more as
he can purchase additional pooling insurance from established firms even without disclosing to them his purchase
from the entrant firm.

19

As for theorem 2: any cream-skimming strategy must entail a contract preferred by the low
risk (diagrammatically, below VL), and be such that, with whatever supplemental insurance that
the high risk individual buys from the established firms, put the individual above the line A*C*-𝑃𝑃

the line through A* with slope 1−𝑃𝑃𝐻𝐻 . The former condition implies that the price of the deviant
𝐻𝐻

contract must be below 𝑞𝑞�. Given the strategies 𝑆𝑆𝑘𝑘∗ , if the deviant contract D entails α ≤ 𝛼𝛼, the high

risk individual tops it up to 𝛼𝛼, and it is clear that this allocation is preferred to A*, i.e. D does not

cream skim, and loses money. 36 If the deviant contract entails more insurance than 𝛼𝛼, it is

preferred by VL , the contract by itself must be below A*C*, i.e. would be purchased by high risk
individuals, as is evident in Figure 4 where we have not assumed quasi-concavity.

More formally, if the deviant contract entails insurance of α’ at price q’, then self-selection requires q’α’ + 𝑞𝑞�(𝛼𝛼 −
𝛼𝛼′) ≥𝑞𝑞�𝛼𝛼 , which is never satisfied if α’ > 0 and q’ < 𝑞𝑞�.

36

8. Extensions: Non-uniqueness of equilibrium
The equilibrium is not unique: there are other strategies that can sustain the equilibrium allocation
𝐸𝐸 ∗ . For instance, once we extend the strategy space of firms so that contract sales to an individual

can be conditioned on the price as well as the amount of insurance purchased, and information

disclosure rules specify the revelation of not just the amounts of insurance, but also the price, we
can formulate a slightly different strategy supporting the same equilibrium allocation 𝐸𝐸 ∗ , as is

shown in the Appendix C. 37 In some ways the analysis of the equilibrium is simpler, 38 but it entails
using latent policies, policies which are only sold in response to out of equilibrium purchases from
other insurance firms but which are not purchased in equilibrium.
9. Extensions to Cases with Many Types
The result on existence of equilibrium can be extended to the case with many types. (See
Stiglitz-Yun (2016).) An equilibrium strategy in a case with the three types, for example, can be
described in a similar way to the case with two-types. As illustrated in Figure 5, there is a pooling
contract with all three types, contract A, the most preferred by the lowest risk type; and a partial
pooling contract B with additional insurance pooling together the two riskiest types, where B is
the most preferred along the zero profit line for partial pooling; and finally, a contract C, providing
full insurance to the highest risk type. In equilibrium consumers purchase A only (the lowest risk
type) or A and B or A, B and C (the highest risk type), depending upon their types.

37

This equilibrium, as well as that discussed in Appendix D, also do not require that the single crossing property be
satisfied.
38
As presented in the Appendix C, this equilibrium may allow for a simpler disclosure rule (than that of 𝑆𝑆𝑘𝑘∗ ) of a
firm, which is to disclose to others just its own sales, not information revealed by its customers

21

There are three types of firms, those selling the full pooling contract, those selling the partial
pooling contract, and those selling the price contract to the high risk individuals. They adopt the
same information disclosure rule as in the case of two types of individuals. 39 Consumers truthfully
fully reveal to the other insurers their information about their purchases of the fully pooling
contract A (since all purchase the same amount, such information in equilibrium reveals no
information about who they are). 40 Consumers reveal information about their purchases of the
39

That is, revealing information only to firms not revealed to be sellers to individuals.

40

Accordingly, no individual is worse off revealing his purchases of the full pooling contract A than not fully

22

partial pooling policies B only to firms not (revealed to be) selling the fully pooling policy. By
the same reasoning as in the two-type case, there is no room for a cream-skimming deviant contract
offering D that profitably attracts only low or medium types, as riskier types are also induced to
choose D as they can purchase additional insurance along the lines DE and EF (as shown in Figure
5); and by the same reasoning the partially pooling contract B can be sustained. 41 This argument
can also be applied to the case with a continuum of types as well.
10. Previous literature
In the more than four decades since RS appeared, its disquieting results have given rise to a large
literature, which we can divide into a few major strands.

The first looked for alternative

equilibrium concepts, or game forms, under which equilibrium might always exist, or under which
a pooling equilibrium might exist. Hellwig (1987) was the first to provide a game-theoretic
framework in a dynamic setting to analyze these equilibria and contrast one with another.
Rothschild and Stiglitz (1997) reviewed the literature as it existed to that point, suggesting that
there had not yet been an adequate alternative resolution as to what a competitive market
equilibrium should look like in the presence of information asymmetries. For instance, in Wilson’s
reactive equilibrium (1977), the entry of even a very small firm induces all firms to “react,” by
withdrawing their pooling contracts, making the deviant contract unprofitable and enabling the
pooling equilibrium to be sustained. 42

43

A second strand more related to the analysis here has explored the consequences of different
information structures, in particular, the possibility of non-disclosed contracts. 44 Most notable are
revealing his purchases. In fact, in the three-type case, an individual buying insurance from other than a fully
pooling seller has an incentive to disclose his purchase from a fully pooling seller, because otherwise that insurer
discloses to his fully pooling insurer his sales, and then then the seller of policy would cancel the contract it sold to
him.
41
By the same token, there is no incentive for contract manipulation.
42
More recently Netzer and Scheuer (2014) have revived a variant of the Wilson-Miyazaki reactive equilibrium.
Firms may "opt out" of the market after observing the contract offers of other firms. They show that as long as the
costs of opting out are nonzero, but not too large, there is a unique outcome - the Miyazaki-Wilson one.
43
Mixed strategy equilibria (e.g. studied by Dasgupta and Maskin (1986) and Farinha Luz (forthcoming), while
interesting as an analytic solution, are unpersuasive as a description of what any market might look like. The notion
that one might go to an insurance firm and choose among lotteries, which would assign probability distributions to
benefits or premia, seems largely fanciful. Why that is so may necessitate an enquiry into behavioral economics, or
into the economics of trust: how does one know that, say, the contract has been drawn from the purported probability
distribution of contracts? One typically only sees one’s own outcome.
44
See also the earlier papers of Jaynes (1978) and Ales-Maziero (2012). Ales-Maziero (2012) focused on the case of
adverse selection in a non-exclusive environment, characterizing the conditions for an equilibrium to exist and
showing that an equilibrium, if it exists, is a separating one where only the highest-risk type purchase full insurance
at the actuarially fair price. As we explain in Theorem 3 and the discussion leading up to it, in an environment with
secret contracts, there can never exist a RS (separating) equilibrium, and there cannot exist a price equilibrium in

23

a series of papers by Attar-Mariotti-Salanie (2011, 2014, 2016). In the first (which is more akin
to Akerlof’s model of lemons and has a different scope of applications), using latent policies, they
establish a condition for existence—the presence of an aggregate capacity constraint. Their later
(2014) model (which employs preferences that are a generalization of the form considered in this
paper) emphasizes the importance of firms being able to offer a menu of contracts, but they get
existence only under very restrictive conditions—conditions which are never satisfied in our
canonical model. 45 In their (2016) model, they allow firms to sell only a single contract, but, again,
in general, existence fails. More broadly, we consider a situation that is closely related to those
they study—all entail looking for equilibrium in a simple adverse selection model-- but ours is still
markedly different from theirs; ours is the natural one relevant in insurance markets, while they
employ special assumptions which make their analysis inapplicable to this market. 46
Their work highlights the important consequences of different information structures. The
central objective of this paper, by contrast, is endogenizing the information structure - allowing
firms and individuals to decide what information to disclose to whom. The closest works to our
paper within the adverse selection literature are Jaynes (1978, 2011) and Hellwig (1988), who
analyze a model with a certain type of strategic communication among firms about customers’
contract information. Jaynes (1978) characterizes an equilibrium outcome that involves a pooling
allocation plus supplemental provision at the high-risk price, the allocation which our analysis (as
well as that of Attar-Mariotti-Salanie (2016)) showed to be the only possible allocation. However,
as Hellwig (1988) clarified, in Jaynes’ (1978) 2-stage framework, the strategy of firms including
the associated strategic communication is not a Nash equilibrium but a reactive equilibrium, with
firms responding to the presence of particular deviant contracts, and thus Jaynes’ formulation was
subject to the same objections to reactive equilibria raised earlier. While our work differs from
that of Jaynes and Hellwig in several ways 47 , perhaps most important is that we consider

which both groups purchase insurance; under certain restrictive conditions there may exist a price equilibrium in which
only the high risk individual purchases insurance.
45
Their condition rules out situations in which “both the low-risk and the high-risk agents purchase a basic policy at
a medium price, with the high-risk agent purchasing on top of this a supplementary policy at a higher price." By
contrast, we characterize precisely such an outcome.
46
In particular, in our model (1), preferences in {α,β} are strictly concave.
47
Importantly, Hellwig’s analysis is based on a four-stage game, in which firms decide to whom they send customer
information (in stage 3) only after observing contract offers announced by firms (stage 1) and purchased by consumers
(stage 2). In other words, their communication strategies are allowed to be conditional upon contract offers made by
other firms. While Hellwig (1988) shows that the Jaynes allocation (the equilibrium allocation in our paper) can be
sustained as a sequential equilibrium in the four-stage game, Jaynes (2011) attempted to characterize the “Jaynes

24

information revelation strategies by consumers as well as firms. This turns out to be critical in the
analysis of the existence of a Nash equilibrium, for it importantly allows the creation of
asymmetries of information about insurance purchases between “established” firms and deviant
firms. Without that, the pooling contract would not be able to be sustained. As we have noted,
there is a delicate balance: on the one hand, one has to prevent overinsurance by high risk
individuals purchasing pooling contracts (which requires established firms to know certain
information), and on the other hand, one has to prevent a deviant firm from having enough
information to enforce an exclusive contract that would break the pooling equilibrium. The
consumer and firm information strategies which we describe do this, and it should be apparent
that, at least in a simple game form, models relying on just firm information strategies cannot do
this, because they do not have the information basis on which to engage in this kind of disclosure
discrimination. 48
11. The no-disclosure limited information price equilibria
A final strand of literature to which this paper is related is that which assumes no disclosure of
insurance purchases, implying that the only information which a firm has about the purchases of
an individual are the sales the firm of the itself, assuming that there is not anonymity in sales. This
literature, however, does not endogenize the decision not to disclose, but takes that as given.
The standard assumption in the adverse selection literature (see e.g. Arrow, 1965) is that
insurance firms and individuals simply take the price of insurance as given, and consumers buy as
much at that price as they want. Competitive equilibrium requires that there be no profits (on
average). More formally, we denote the purchase by a high risk individual at a price q(P)
corresponding to an accident probability 𝑃𝑃 as 𝛼𝛼𝐻𝐻 (𝑃𝑃), and similarly for the low risk as 𝛼𝛼𝐿𝐿 (𝑃𝑃)
𝑃𝑃

where q(P) = 1−𝑃𝑃 . The weighted average accident probability when the price is q is then
𝛼𝛼 (𝑞𝑞(𝑃𝑃))
𝛼𝛼 (𝑞𝑞(𝑃𝑃))
𝑃𝑃�(q(P)) ≡ 𝑃𝑃𝐻𝐻 𝜃𝜃 𝛼𝛼�𝐻𝐻e (𝑞𝑞(𝑃𝑃)) + 𝑃𝑃𝐿𝐿 (1 − 𝜃𝜃) 𝛼𝛼�𝐿𝐿e (𝑞𝑞(𝑃𝑃)),

(6)

allocation” as a perfect Bayes equilibrium in a two-stage game, in which firms announce their contract offers and
communication strategies simultaneously. His formulation is thus markedly different from that presented here.
48
That is, at least in the initial round of disclosures, firm disclosure can only be based on individual purchases. Assume
some firms sold policies which did not disclose their sales. High risk individuals would purchase such insurance
beyond 𝛼𝛼, and the restriction that they not do so would not be enforceable. Thus, the putative allocation could not be
sustained,since the non-disclosure pooling contracts would make a loss. On the other hand, if firms sold only full
disclosure policies, then a deviant firm offering an exclusive contract in the region z would be able to enforce
exclusivity, and this would break the pooling allocation. Hence, again, the putative equilibrium could not be sustained.
There has to be some basis on which firms can differentiate among whom to disclose; our consumer revelation

Since at any price, the high risk buy more insurance (𝛼𝛼𝐻𝐻 (𝑞𝑞) > 𝛼𝛼𝐿𝐿 (𝑞𝑞)), the weighted accident
probability 𝑃𝑃�(q(P)) is higher than the population weighted average 𝑃𝑃�: 𝑃𝑃�(q(P)) > 𝑃𝑃�.

Now we define a (competitive) price equilibrium as 𝑃𝑃𝑒𝑒 satisfying the following conditions: (a)

(uninformed) sellers have rational expectations 𝑃𝑃𝑒𝑒 about the weighted average accident

probability of the buyers; (b) with those rational expectations, prices are set to generate zero profits;
and (c) at those prices consumers buy the quantities that they wish. 49 Thus, a price equilibrium 𝑃𝑃𝑒𝑒

Nash equilibrium and non-existence of a partial information-no disclosure price equilibrium.
In the no-disclosure price equilibrium, the insurance firms simply take the price as given. However,
while a firm doesn’t know the size of the policies taken up by an individual from other firms, he
knows what he has sold. 52 An insurance firm can offer a large policy - he knows to whom he sells,
and can refuse to sell a second policy to the same individual. 53 We define a partial information-no
disclosure (Nash) price equilibrium as an equilibrium where the insurance firm knows at least

We could define a price equilibrium in a Nash-Bertrand fashion by adding another condition that each firm, taking
the prices of others as given, chooses the price which maximizes its profits. In this case, it can be shown that there
exists a unique price equilibrium, the lowest price at which equation (7) is satisfied.
52
This would not be the case if individuals purchased insurance about an event affecting a third party, and firms sold
such insurance without knowledge of the purchaser.

In the context of moral hazard, the implication of this simple observation were explored in Arnott-Stiglitz (1991a,

information about the amount of insurance it sells: a partial information-no disclosure price
equilibrium is a set of contracts such that (a) each quantity-contract at least breaks even; (b) there
exists a price at which each individuals can buy as much insurance at the price offered at he wishes
and at which insurance premiums at least cover pay-outs; and (c) there does not exist any policy
which (given the information structure) can be offered which will be purchased and make a profit.

Any policy proposing to break a price equilibrium must satisfy two conditions: to be purchased, it
has to have a lower price than the market price, but to make a profit, it must have a higher price
than that corresponding to the actual pool of people buying the policy. Consider a deviant firm that
secretly offered a quantity policy, say the policy which maximizes the utility of the low risk
individuals at a price corresponding to P′, with 𝑃𝑃𝑒𝑒 > P′ > 𝑃𝑃� such as (α′ , β′ ) in Figure 6. It sells
27

only one unit of the policy to each individual, and restricts the purchases of all to the fixed quantity
policy. Then all low-risk individuals will buy the policy, and whether or not the high-risk do, it
will make an (expected) profit. It thus breaks the price-equilibrium. The one case where this
argument doesn’t work is that where at the pooling price, low risk individuals do not buy any
insurance. We have thus established
Theorem 3. There is no partial information-no disclosure price equilibrium where both types
of individuals buy insurance.
Put differently, there is no “price equilibrium” when firms can offer an undisclosed quantity
contract and ration the sale, say to one policy to a customer 54. What is remarkable about Theorem
4 is how little information is required to break the price equilibrium: the firm just uses its own
contract information to implement the quantity constraint.
It is natural to ask, if there is not a price equilibrium, is there some analogous equilibrium, with
say just fixed quantity contracts? Consider a case where the two groups are quite similar. Each
insurance firm sells insurance in fixed units, say �𝛼𝛼�, 𝛽𝛽̅ �, the policy which is most preferred by the

low risk individual along the break-even pooling line. The high risk individual would not want to
buy two units of that insurance. But he would supplement his purchase with the undisclosed
insurance at his own price, in an amount that brings him to full insurance. The analysis of this
paper has shown that this kind of pooling contract cannot be an equilibrium: there is always a
deviant policy that could be offered that would be taken up only by the low risk individuals, given
the posited information structure. In other words, given this partial information structure, there is
no equilibrium, ever, where both groups buy insurance. By contrast, with the more complex
endogenous information structure described in the paper, there is always an equilibrium.
12. Concluding Remarks
In insurance markets with asymmetric information, firms will use what information is available
to make inferences about purchasers of insurance, including information about the amount of

54
We can also show that there is a Nash partial information price equilibrium where only the high risk individuals
buy insurance if and only if 𝛼𝛼𝐿𝐿 (𝑞𝑞(𝑃𝑃�)) = 0. This condition is stricter than that in which there exists a price equilibrium
with a single type: 𝛼𝛼𝐿𝐿 (𝑞𝑞(𝑃𝑃𝐻𝐻 )) = 0. Thus, even a corner price equilibrium may not be a Nash partial information price
equilibrium. In a somewhat different set-up, Jaynes (1978) presents a set of similar results. The condition posited here
for the existence of a partial disclosure price equilibrium, 𝛼𝛼𝐿𝐿 ((𝑃𝑃� )) = 0, is stricter than that specified by Jaynes (1978),
which would be equivalent to 𝛼𝛼𝐿𝐿 ((𝑃𝑃𝐻𝐻 )) = 0. Jaynes (1978) shows that a price equilibrium 𝑞𝑞 ∗ at which each agent
purchases his Walrasian demand, which is a no-information equilibrium in our model, cannot be sustained in the
presence of a fixed-quantity contract when more than one type of agent purchases insurance at 𝑞𝑞 ∗ .

insurance purchased. High risk individuals know this, and have an incentive to do what they can
to ensure that insurance firms can’t tell that they are high risk, and to try to keep any relevant
information (such as the amount of insurance purchased) secret, and there may be market
incentives for firms to comply.
The earlier work of Akerlof and Rothschild-Stiglitz had, of course, shown the importance of
the information structure: information about insurance purchased conveyed important information
about the individual’s type, and therefore, whether that information was available was central in
determining the nature of the equilibrium. The differences between Akerlof and RS reflected
differences in assumptions about the information structure, e.g. RS assumed sufficient information
to enforce exclusivity. Allowing undisclosed contracts and incorporating realistic assumptions
about things that insurance firms know, in particular, that they know the identities of their
customers and the quantities purchased, destroys both the Rothschild-Stiglitz and the Akerlof
equilibria.
Expanding the equilibrium construct to include endogenous information disclosure rules is
complex, but in fact helps resolve some longstanding conundrums in information economics, in
particular the general non-existence of pooling equilibria and the possible non-existence even of a
separating equilibrium.
When we endogenize information revelation, the unique equilibrium allocation is a partially
disclosed pooling contract - the pooling contract most preferred by the low risk individual 55 - plus
undisclosed supplemental insurance for just the high risk individuals. The equilibrium strategies
endogenously create potential asymmetries in information about insurance purchases that serve as
an important barrier to entry to firms that otherwise might break the pooling contract; we show
that at least within our framework, such asymmetries are essential to supporting the equilibrium.
In some ways, the equilibrium that arises with endogenous information looks much more like
observed equilibria: Equilibrium always exists, and always entails some pooling. Moreover, the
analysis and its results do not rely on the highly restrictive single crossing property which has been
central in the literature spawned by RS.
The insurance model has proven a useful tool for analyzing more generally markets with
asymmetric information, and the papers analyzing imperfect and asymmetric information in that

That is, the pooling allocation at the population weighted accident probabilities most preferred by low-risk
individuals. In our equilibrium, the contract may be divided up among a number of firms.

context have led to a huge literature, with the concepts being applied to a rich variety of
institutional structures 56 . The natural information assumptions concerning potentially hidden
actions and hidden characteristics differ across markets. This paper has raised questions about both
the Akerlof and RS analyses, and by implication, the results in the large literature based on them.
We hope that this paper will, like the earlier RS and Akerlof analyses, spawn further research
in the context of other markets in the analysis of market equilibrium with asymmetric information
where contracts and the information structure/revelation are endogenously and simultaneously
determined.
APPENDICES
Appendix A: Proof of Lemma 4.
Given the equilibrium strategies, a consumer purchasing more than 𝛼𝛼 must not reveal his full

purchases to any firm. Assume a consumer purchases more than 𝛼𝛼 from N firms, and suppose the

consumer makes any set of disclosures. Pick up first the firm that is the most informed (by the
consumer) 57, say firm 𝑗𝑗1 (< N), who knows about the consumer’s purchases from firms 1,---, 𝑗𝑗1

(including his own sales) and does not know about his purchases from firms 𝑗𝑗1 + 1, --, N, a group

of firms undisclosed to 𝑗𝑗1. (When there is a tie in which firm is the most informed, choose any of

those; 𝑗𝑗1 = 1 if a consumer does not disclose anything to any firm). Focus then upon the firms
(𝑗𝑗1 + 1, --, N) undisclosed to 𝑗𝑗1, and consider a firm who is the most informed of the purchases

from those firms, say 𝑗𝑗2 , who knows about the purchases from 𝑗𝑗1 + 1, --, 𝑗𝑗2 . Similarly, we consider

the most informed of the firms undisclosed to 𝑗𝑗2 and 𝑗𝑗1, say 𝑗𝑗3 . We can continue until we get 𝑗𝑗𝑘𝑘 ,
where 𝑗𝑗𝑘𝑘 = 𝑁𝑁. Then, clearly, the purchase from firm 𝑗𝑗𝑘𝑘 is undisclosed to firms 𝑗𝑗1, 𝑗𝑗2 , --, 𝑗𝑗𝑘𝑘−1.

Now consider the disclosures by firms. As a firm discloses to any other firm that is undisclosed

by the consumer (as his insurer), all the firms 𝑗𝑗1, 𝑗𝑗2 , --, 𝑗𝑗𝑘𝑘−1 (at least) will disclose to the firm 𝑗𝑗𝑘𝑘

their own sales and information received from the consumer, implying that the firm 𝑗𝑗𝑘𝑘 knows all
of the N purchases. 58

56

It is important to recognize that, for the most part, these models of insurance were not intended to provide a good
institutional analysis of the insurance market; rather, the insurance market provided the paradigm for studying
behavior in, for example, labor, product, and capital markets because it seemed so simple to strip away institutional
details, and study markets unencumbered by them. It was for this reason that these paradigmatic models proved so
fruitful. The analysis of this paper should be taken in the same spirit.
57
By most informed, we simply mean the number of contracts that have been disclosed.
58
It is trivial that this procedure works in the example given in the text, where the individual purchases ½ 𝛼𝛼� from A,
B, and C, disclosing its sales to B to A, to C to B, and to A to C. All are equally informed. A then knows about its
own sales and that of B, and discloses this information to C, who then knows about A, B, and C’s sales, who then

Appendix B: Proof of Theorem 2
It is obvious that by Lemma 4, the strategy 𝑆𝑆𝑘𝑘∗ generates the equilibrium allocation 𝐸𝐸 ∗ . We will

now show the strategy 𝑆𝑆𝑘𝑘∗ sustains 𝐸𝐸 ∗ against any deviant contract (with any restriction or

disclosure policy). Note first that a deviant firm cannot make profits by attracting only high-risk
individuals in the presence of non-established firms offering any amount of insurances at 𝑞𝑞𝐻𝐻 . This

is because then no individual would pay a price higher than 𝑞𝑞𝐻𝐻 since a deviant firm, even with CM,
cannot induce the established firms (with 𝑆𝑆𝑘𝑘∗ ) to sell more than 𝛼𝛼 at 𝑞𝑞� under any circumstance. If

the deviant attracts both high and low risk, his contract would have to lie on r below the pooling
line, and the best that he could be expected to do is zero profits. A deviant firm can thus make
positive profits only by attracting only low-risk types.

Lemma 5. A necessary condition for a deviant contract to attract only low risk individuals is that
the contract be in the non-empty region z in Figure 2, the set of (α, β)’s such that
𝑉𝑉𝐿𝐿 (𝛼𝛼, 𝛽𝛽) > 𝑉𝑉𝐿𝐿∗ and

β − 𝑞𝑞�𝛼𝛼 ≥ 𝑞𝑞𝐻𝐻 (𝛼𝛼 -𝛼𝛼),

where 𝑉𝑉𝐿𝐿∗ is the expected utility of the low risk individuals in the putative equilibrium.

Clearly, when the first inequality is not satisfied, the low risk individuals will not purchase

the policy, and when the second condition is not satisfied, the high risk individual will purchase
the policy, supplementing it with the secret insurance.
Consider any policy D(= (𝛼𝛼𝐷𝐷 , 𝛽𝛽𝐷𝐷 )) in z (satisfying the above two conditions). Given the

equilibrium strategies of the established firms, then high risk individuals will buy D,

supplementing it with pooling insurance from the established firms, bringing the entire purchases
(of revealed insurance) at least to 𝛼𝛼�.

Given the conditions imposed on preferences (quasi-concavity, slope of indifference curve

equaling 𝑞𝑞𝐻𝐻 with full insurance) 59, high risk individuals will wish to buy as much insurance at the
pooling odds as they can. With full disclosure, they can buy 𝛼𝛼�. Since individuals have a choice
of disclosure, they can at least get 𝛼𝛼� with full disclosure to established firms but with no disclosure
to the firm offering D. Denote by D′ total insurance (D plus the pooling contract plus the

supplemental secret insurance). It is obvious that 𝑉𝑉𝐻𝐻 (𝐷𝐷′ ) > 𝑉𝑉𝐻𝐻 (𝐴𝐴∗ ). With the given consumer
cancels its policy.
59

As discussed in section 7, our results hold even with preferences that are not quasi-concave.

31

and firm disclosure strategies, no firm will disclose to the deviant firm their sales to the individual,
so that the deviant firm cannot enforce, by any disclosure policy, any restriction necessary to
prevent consumers from buying supplemental pooling insurance. It follows that there exists no
contract breaking the pooling contract 𝐴𝐴∗ . 60
Appendix C: An alternative equilibrium

In this appendix, we show that the equilibrium allocation can be supported by alternative contracts,
entailing different restrictions and disclosures. We now assume that restrictions are based not just
upon the amount of insurance purchased but also upon the price (equivalently, on both α and β),
and when consumers and firms disclose information, they disclose not just the amount of
insurance, but the price at which they purchased insurance. But an equilibrium entails the same
information disclosure rule – disclosing information about a consumer only to those not revealed
to be his insurers - implying that the same information asymmetry arising out of the disclosure rule
sustains an equilibrium in this case. Assume the established firms 61 have a strategy 𝑆𝑆𝑘𝑘𝑜𝑜 which
entails the same disclosure rule about to whom to disclose as that of 𝑆𝑆𝑘𝑘∗

62

while offering

𝛼𝛼� at a price 𝑞𝑞� if the individual has no other insurance

0 if the individual has purchased other insurance at a price higher than or equal to 𝑞𝑞�

𝛼𝛼𝑘𝑘 ≤ 𝛼𝛼�(D)) at the price 𝑞𝑞� if the individual has purchased elsewhere a contract D that offers

insurance 𝛼𝛼𝐷𝐷 at a price q < 𝑞𝑞�, where 𝛼𝛼�(D) is the maximum amount of insurance that a low risk
individual would want to purchase to supplement the contract D at the pooling odds. Because the

low risk individual is better off than at 𝐴𝐴∗ , 𝛼𝛼�(D) + 𝛼𝛼𝐷𝐷 > 𝛼𝛼�, while 𝛼𝛼�(D) ≤ 𝛼𝛼� with the inequality

holding for 𝛼𝛼𝐷𝐷 > 0 . 63) In words, the established firms with 𝑆𝑆𝑘𝑘𝑜𝑜 sell the full contract 𝐴𝐴∗ (and only
60

Two minor subtleties: While we showed that in equilibrium, there is no contract manipulation, we have to show
that no deviant firm will engage in CM. But it is obvious (by our earlier analysis) that CM is attractive only to high
𝑃𝑃
risk individuals. This implies that no deviant strategy with CM can attract low-risk types only by charging q ∈ ( 𝐿𝐿 ,
1−𝑃𝑃𝐿𝐿

𝑃𝑃�

), since no deviant strategy without CM can. Secondly, our earlier analysis established that the deviant firm would
1−𝑃𝑃�
not be able to enforce the exclusivity it needed regardless of the information disclosure strategy of the deviant firm.

61

We also assume, as before, that the other firms (j=M+1, --, N) offer any amount of insurance at a price 𝑞𝑞𝐻𝐻
without disclosure. There is a single deviant firm.
62
The disclosure rule of 𝑆𝑆𝑘𝑘𝑜𝑜 can be simpler than that of 𝑆𝑆𝑘𝑘∗ ; firms need disclose to others their own sales only, not
information revealed by their customers, because every consumer purchases 𝛼𝛼� at a price 𝑞𝑞� in equilibrium.
𝑃𝑃

𝛼𝛼�(D) = 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝛼𝛼 {𝑃𝑃𝐿𝐿 𝑈𝑈(𝑊𝑊 − 𝑑𝑑 + 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛼𝛼𝐷𝐷 ) + (1 − 𝑃𝑃𝐿𝐿 )𝑈𝑈(𝑊𝑊 − 𝑞𝑞�𝛼𝛼 − 𝑞𝑞𝛼𝛼𝐷𝐷 )} (where 𝐿𝐿 < q < 𝑞𝑞�).
1−𝑃𝑃𝐿𝐿

Differentiating the f.o.c. for 𝛼𝛼�(D) with respect to 𝛼𝛼𝐷𝐷 and α, we have the result that, so long as U” < 0, 𝛼𝛼�(D) + 𝛼𝛼𝐷𝐷 >
𝛼𝛼� and 𝛼𝛼�(D) < 𝛼𝛼� for 𝛼𝛼𝐷𝐷 > 0. Note that this result does not require preferences to satisfy the single-crossing
property; the result can hold even when different types of individuals have different utility functions, in which case
the single crossing property may not be satisfied.

that contract) to an individual with no other insurance (so far as it knows); sells nothing to anyone
who has purchased any other insurance at less (or at equally) attractive terms than the pooling
equilibrium (it can infer that such a person is a high risk individual); and sells a variable amount
of insurance, bringing total insurance purchased up to, at a maximum an amount 𝛼𝛼�(D) at the
pooling price if the individual has purchased a contract D at a lower price than 𝑞𝑞�.

The equilibrium looks precisely as before, except now everyone purchases the policy 𝐴𝐴∗ from

a single insurance firm. Out of equilibrium behavior entails the use of latent contracts, the policies
the sale of which are only triggered when individuals have purchased a deviant contract, D. It
should be clear that no low risk individual will buy any policy sold at a price above 𝑞𝑞� .

Accordingly, any policy sold at a price between 𝑞𝑞𝐻𝐻 and 𝑞𝑞� loses money. Also, since the amount of

additional pooling insurance offered on top of any insurance revealed to be purchased elsewhere
is not greater than 𝛼𝛼�, no high-risk individuals would be willing to pay an average price higher than

𝑞𝑞𝐻𝐻 (getting some part of the package at a price below 𝑞𝑞� .) to trigger the sale of 𝛼𝛼𝑘𝑘

64

Thus we can

focus on deviant policies sold at a price below 𝑞𝑞�.

High risk individuals will supplement D, topping up total purchases to 𝛼𝛼�(D) of insurance. But

that means that expected utility of the high risk individual, supplementing D with the pooling
contract (up to 𝛼𝛼�(D)), and supplementing that with secret insurance (at its own odds) is higher

than at the original allocation, i.e. the high risk individual as well as the low risk individual buys
D, and that means that D loses money, since D is sold at a price below 𝑞𝑞� (𝑖𝑖. 𝑒𝑒. is below the pooling
line.)

It is thus clear that this simple strategy can support the equilibrium. 65 66

Appendix D: Deviants offering Multiple Contracts at Different Prices

In this appendix, we show that our results hold even when firms are allowed to sell multiple
contracts at different prices. The central issue is whether this allows a deviant firm to break our
putative equilibrium by taking advantage of cross-subsidization. A deviant firm does so to induce

64
Thus, if the individual chose not to reveal any purchase from the deviant firm, he could have purchased at 𝑞𝑞� an
amount 𝛼𝛼�. Earlier, we referred to the kind of deception where an individual purchases two policies (perhaps
bundled, as here) and discloses only one as contract manipulation.
65
As before, it is important that the deviant firm not be able to enforce exclusivity, and the information strategy ensures
that this is the case.
66
In the main text, we showed that the pooling contract cannot be broken except possibly by a contract in the area z, and a
straightforward adaptation of the arguments there apply here. The analysis here implies that even contracts in z cannot
break the putative equilibrium.

33

self-selection among the applicants - with the self-selection process reducing the costs of the high
risk individuals buying insurance from the deviant. We first explain why the set of strategies
considered earlier now doesn’t “work”. We then describe intuitively the challenges involved in
finding an equilibrium strategy. Next we provide the formal analysis, establishing the main
theorem of this appendix.

Let {A*, C*} represent the equilibrium allocation described earlier. Now consider the deviant
pair of policies {A*B, G} (as depicted in Figure 7), where A*B entails an offer of 𝛼𝛼𝑆𝑆 at 𝑞𝑞� without

disclosure and G offers 𝛼𝛼𝐷𝐷 at a price q lower than 𝑞𝑞� with disclosure and with G being offered
34

conditional on no additional insurance being purchased. There always exists a continuum of pairs
of policies (A*B, G) such that G is chosen by all the low-risk individuals while A*B is chosen by
all the high-risk who simultaneously buy A*, that is, the high risk individuals supplement A*B
with the pooling insurance A*, i.e. they buy 𝛼𝛼� of insurance from the established firms and 𝛼𝛼𝑆𝑆 from
𝑝𝑝

the deviant firm. Because the price q is greater than 1−𝑝𝑝𝐿𝐿 , the deviant firm makes a profit on G
𝐿𝐿

even though it makes a loss on the contract purchased by the high risk individuals. By carefully
choosing {A*B, G} or {𝛼𝛼𝑆𝑆 , (𝛼𝛼𝐷𝐷 , 𝑞𝑞)}, the deviant firm can make overall positive profits. For

instance, this will be so if 𝛼𝛼𝑆𝑆 is small. 67 While there are large total losses associated with the

purchase of insurance by high risk individuals, most of those losses are borne by the established

firms, who now sell their pooling contract only to the high risk individual. With an appropriately
chosen {G}, the deviant firm gets all the low risk individuals for all of their insurance, and the
high risk people only for the supplemental amount 𝛼𝛼𝑆𝑆 .

To prevent this type of a deviation, we need to make contract G more attractive to high-risk

types by providing more additional insurance at a price 𝑞𝑞� than 𝑆𝑆𝑘𝑘∗ does, should a deviant firm try

such a strategy, while limiting the total provision by all the firms to 𝛼𝛼� in equilibrium. To do this,

we need to have a latent contract which offers an individual sufficient amount of extra insurance
at 𝑞𝑞� in the presence of a deviant contract G, so that there can be no profitable self-selection.

More formally, consider a strategy 𝑆𝑆𝑘𝑘𝑜𝑜 which has the same rule about to whom to disclose as

𝑆𝑆𝑘𝑘∗ , but offers the same set of contracts with the same restrictions as 𝑆𝑆𝑘𝑘∗ only when (to its knowledge)
the price of insurance purchased elsewhere is not lower than 𝑞𝑞� while offering (in the aggregate,
among all the established firms) a large policy, say

68

𝛼𝛼� ≤ 𝛼𝛼�,

in addition to the

policy purchased at q < 𝑞𝑞�, at a price 𝑞𝑞� to those who purchased insurance elsewhere at a price

lower than 𝑞𝑞�. Thus, 𝑆𝑆𝑘𝑘𝑜𝑜 contains a latent contract that is sold only out-of-equilibrium. We can then

see that 𝑆𝑆𝑘𝑘𝑜𝑜 supports the allocation 𝐸𝐸 ∗ in equilibrium as it shares with 𝑆𝑆𝑘𝑘∗ the same set of contracts
in equilibrium. But, with the appropriate choice of 𝛼𝛼�, 𝑆𝑆𝑘𝑘𝑜𝑜 ensures that the two-contract deviant firm

loses money. 𝛼𝛼� should be not be greater than 𝛼𝛼�, because otherwise high-risk individuals would be
More specifically, a deviant firm can set q ≈ 𝑞𝑞�, 𝛼𝛼𝐷𝐷 ≈ 𝛼𝛼� and thus a small 𝛼𝛼𝑆𝑆 , yielding the desired self-selection on
the part of high-risk individuals between A*B and G, where G is a contract just below VL near A*.
68
It should be clear from the analysis that all that is required is that the latent policies offer a sufficient amount of
insurance as to make G attractive to the high risk individual. As in Appendix C, the firms not offering the pooling
contract (j=M+1, --, N) offer any amount of insurance at 𝑞𝑞𝐻𝐻 without disclosure.
67

35

willing to pay an average price higher than 𝑞𝑞𝐻𝐻 , so that through contract manipulation they could

purchase 𝛼𝛼�. 69 We set 𝛼𝛼� = 𝛼𝛼�. Now we will focus upon a cream-skimming strategy G, which offers
𝛼𝛼𝐷𝐷 at price q below 𝑞𝑞.
� A high-risk individual i choosing G would not reveal to the deviant firm

d his purchases of pooling insurance from other firms, but has an incentive to reveal to the
established firms his purchase of low price insurance, for that triggers the offer of supplemental
insurance. But given the strategy 𝑆𝑆𝑘𝑘𝑜𝑜 , that means that the established firms don’t disclose their

sales to the deviant, which ensures that the exclusivity provision associated with G cannot be
enforced. Knowing this, to induce self-selection, a deviant firm must offer a “large” contract A*B’

– entailing insurance of 𝛼𝛼𝑆𝑆′ without disclosure. Given a choice between G and A*B’, all high risk

individuals choose A*B’ and all low risk individuals choose G. We can then show that any pair of
contracts (G, A*B’) that induces self-selection makes losses.
To see this, note that if a high risk individual purchases A*B’ without disclosure, his total
insurance purchased at 𝑞𝑞� is 𝛼𝛼𝑆𝑆′ + 𝛼𝛼� . The high risk individual then supplements this with secret
insurance at price 𝑞𝑞𝐻𝐻 bringing him to full insurance. By contrast, with policy G (disclosed) the

individual gets (𝛼𝛼𝐷𝐷 + 𝛼𝛼�) at a total premium of (q𝛼𝛼𝐷𝐷 + 𝑞𝑞�𝛼𝛼�). The high risk individual then
supplements this with insurance at price 𝑞𝑞𝐻𝐻 bringing the individual to full insurance. It is easy to

show that self- selection requires

𝑞𝑞𝐻𝐻 {(𝛼𝛼𝑆𝑆′ + 𝛼𝛼�) − (𝛼𝛼𝐷𝐷 + 𝛼𝛼�)} ≥ 𝑞𝑞�(𝛼𝛼𝑆𝑆′ + 𝛼𝛼�) − (q𝛼𝛼𝐷𝐷 + 𝑞𝑞�𝛼𝛼�)

(8)

Condition (8) can be rewritten as
𝛼𝛼𝐷𝐷 ≤ (𝑞𝑞𝐻𝐻 − q)−1 (𝑞𝑞𝐻𝐻 − 𝑞𝑞�)𝛼𝛼𝑆𝑆′

(8’)

The corresponding profit π{G, 𝐴𝐴∗ 𝐵𝐵 ′ } for the deviant firm is
π{G, 𝐴𝐴∗ 𝐵𝐵 ′ } = −θ𝛼𝛼𝑆𝑆 ′(𝑞𝑞𝐻𝐻 − 𝑞𝑞�) + (1 − 𝜃𝜃)𝛼𝛼𝐷𝐷 (q − 𝑞𝑞𝐿𝐿 )

≤ 𝛼𝛼𝑆𝑆′ (𝑞𝑞𝐻𝐻 − 𝑞𝑞�)(𝑞𝑞𝐻𝐻 − q)−1 [−θ(𝑞𝑞𝐻𝐻 − q) + (1 − θ)(q − 𝑞𝑞𝐿𝐿 )]

= 𝛼𝛼𝑆𝑆 ′(𝑞𝑞𝐻𝐻 − 𝑞𝑞�)(𝑞𝑞𝐻𝐻 − q)−1 [q − 𝑞𝑞�] < 0,

i.e., the total profit for the deviant firm is negative. Alternatively, if the deviant firm fails to
“separate,” so the high risk individuals chooses G, the deviant firm loses money. 70 We have thus
That is, an insurance firm could profitably offer a bundle of two policies, one with a price below 𝑞𝑞� but with an
average price above 𝑞𝑞𝐻𝐻 , and high risk individuals would purchase such a bundle.
70
Our earlier analysis showed that if high and low risk individuals buy the same policy, a deviant cannot break the
equilibrium. We can also verify that a deviant firm cannot profitably attract high-risk individuals through a CM, for at
