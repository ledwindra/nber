A Linearized Version of Lucas's Neutrality Model

ABSTRACT

The model developed in Robert Lucas's influential "Expectations and the
Neutrality of Money" has not been widely used for extensions or modifications
of the original analysis, in part because of its difficulty of manipulation.

The present paper describes a linearized version that--unlike other models
prominent in the rational expectations literature--retains the original's main
features yet is comparatively easy to manipulate.

Two examples of modifications

facilitated by this linearization are included. These involve an autoregressive
money growth specification and the assumption of lump-sum (rather than proportional)
monetary transfers.

I. Introduction
It is at least arguable that the most influential paper of the past
decade in the field of macro and monetary economics has been Robert Lucas's

"Expectations and the Neutrality of Money" (1972). The specific model
developed in that paper has not, however, been widely used for extensions
1/

or modifications of the original analysis.

Instead, most analysts have

adopted alternative models suggested by Lucas (1973), Sargent and Wallace
(1975), or Barro (1976) (1980) in which the supply and demand functions are
2/

not as well grounded in individual choice problems. A major reason for this
practice is, of course, that the model in Lucas (l972)--henceforth, the ENN

model--is not easily solved or manipulated. The object of the present paper
is, accordingly, to describe a linearized version of the ENM model that
3/

retains the original's main features yet is comparatively easy to manipulate.

Two examples of modifications facilitated by this linearization are included.

II. Individual Agents
The ENN model economy is populated with overlapping generations of
agents who live for two periods, able to work when young but not when old.
In period t a young agent expends Nt units of labor, producing a like number

of units of perishable output. Some of this output will typically be exchanged for paper money, which is the only store of value. Old agents receive
monetary transfers from the government, the magnitudes being stochastically
proportional to existing money holdings.

In analysing the young agents' choice problem_old agents have none-- we
begin with a non-stochastic version of the model. Thus we assume that an

agent born in t seeks to maximize tJ(C, N) + V(C) subject to
=

C

+

and Xt+1(/P)(P

=

C,

where C, C are consumption

2
4/

is the nominal money demanded when young,

quantities when young and old,

5/
is the money price of output in t, and

reflects transfers in t+l.

Clearly the agents choices of C C, Nt and At/Pt depend upon the single

variable that is taken parametrically, namely, X1P/P1. And under

and N

Lucas's assumptions concerning the properties of U and V, both
6/

are positively related to XP/P1. Next, we revert to a stochastic setting
but pretend that certainty—equivalence prevails. In particular, we assume that
money demand and labor supply functions can be well approximated by the loglinear relations

(1) X -

(2)

Pt

=

a0 + a1 E(x+i + t -

n = b0+

-

b1 Et(xt+1 +

t+l
t+l

a1 > 0

b1 >0

where lower-case letters denote logarithms. The notation in (1) and (2)

recognizes that expectations formed in t of x1 and 2t+l are relevant for
choices made in t. As in Lucas (1972), it is assumed that agents know the

values of all past variables, but that the (local) value of Pt 5 the only

variable observed contemporaneously. Thus Ext+1 =
is the local (log) price and
7/

t

E(xt 1Ipt,c1, where Pt

denotes values of all variables in t-l

and before.

III. Equilibrium
The ENM economy includes two informationally—distinct islands populated
by agents of the type just described, the total number of which does not

change over time. In each period old agents are allocated across islands so
as to equate the start-of-period money stock on the two islands, while young
agents are assigned randomly with the fraction 13/2 going to island One.

Monetary policy can be characterized by the stochastic behavior of

Mt/Mi where Mt is the post-transfer money supply per old person in

3

period t. The values of

and Mt are the same on both islands, but are

currently unknown to individual agents. Taking logarithms we have
=

with the stochastic behavior of x yet to be specified.
Given the foregoing assumptions, market clearing on island One requires

that (l) =

The random variables

while the corresponding condition on island Two is

xt + 8t•

are independent and identically distributed (iid)

with mean zero and variance C'.
To complete the model, we must specify how the stochastic policy variable

is generated. Following Lucas, we assume in our basic exposition that the

x values are independent of e

IV. Solution
In the specified economy, the behavior of the variables

and Pt on

island One is described by equations (1) and (4). Given the linearity of
these relations and our stochastic assumptions regarding x and
t

clear

(6)

that the

it is

To evaluate Exts we note that agents can, by way of (4), observe the value

Their optimal linear predictor of x is then (x —

giving

Using these values with (6) and (7) we find that

on island One. Since the relationships are the same on island Two except
that

appears in place of 0' this is also true of the expression for

Et(x+i + Pt -

t+l•

Using these expressions in (2) and summing over the

two islands we then find that aggregate employment/output equals

responds positively to monetary shocks x, with a slope coefficient that is
negatively related to the variance of these shocks.

V. First Modification
The usefulness of this linearized version of Lucas's model--apart from

any pedagogic merits--results from its ease of modification. In order to
exemplify the latter, we now consider two variations. In the first of these
we assume that the x policy process is autoregressive, i.e., that

x =

(11)

where e

px1

+

C 1

is iid with E() = 0 and E(c2) =

C.

The price in market One is now determined by (l),(3),(4), and (11) so the
relevant state variables are

(12)

Pt = if0 +

1

m1 x1, £, and G. Accordingly we write

+ if2x 1 +

and note that

Proceeding as before, then, we find that employment/output again obeys

now replacing x as the monetary surprise. Thus

expression (10) but with

the magnitude of the policy parameter p has no effect on the behavior of
output in the ENN model.

VI. Second Modification
For a second and somewhat more substantial variation, we now assume that
transfers to the old are of the lump-sum, rather than proportional, variety.
That is, we assume that each agent believes that the size of the transfer to
be received when old is independent of the quantity of money which that agent

carries into old age. In this case, the constraint on second-period consumption
for an agent born in t

(18)

Thus each young person's choices of

C, C, N, and A/P depend (under perfect foresight) on three variables
and M/P+i. Accordingly, when we log-

faced parametrically: P/P1,

linearize and revert to a stochastic setting, the decision rules in (1) and
(2) must be replaced with the following:

these formulations, the signs of the a. and b. coefficients are determined
.3

by the direction of response of A/P and

.3

to the three parametric variables

in the agent's decision problem. Under Lucas's assumptions, both /P and
N depend positively on

as before--this is the intertemporal substitution

7

phenomenon--but now the response to

10/

income depresses optimal money demand (saving) and labor supply when young.

Consequently, we have a1, b1 > 0 and a2, b2 < 0. From (18) we see that the

effect of M/P+1 on the magnitude of the real transfer in t+l is positive
when

> 1 and negative when

< 1.

Thus a3 and b should be specified

as negative constants when the average money growth rate is positive (EXi > 1-), as

positive when EX+i < 1, and as zeros when EXt1
We can now sketch how analysis proceeds with the autoregressive policy

specification (11). The price in market One is in this case determined by
equations (19), (3), (4), and (11) so expressions (12), (13), and (14) again
11/

apply. Substitution into (19) results in the following replacement for (15):

+ px1 +

+ lT2x

1

+ TT3e + T4t1

+ a2p{x 1 + (ce)] a1 La + im_i + (i÷2)[px I +
Solution of the implied undetermined-coefficient identities then yields

O
and

= 2 (1+a1-a2p)/(1+a1-a1p), 13 = (1+a1-a2p÷a1
=

1T2)/(l+a1),

These expressions can be used, in combination with corresponding

Ti'3.

expressions for market Two, to determine how prices and quantitities behave

in the aggregate. A significant feature of the results, which we can recognize
without further manipulation, is that p appears in the expressions for
ri'3, and IT4.

Consequently, this policy parameter also appears in the solution

for n that is the counterpart of (10). Complete independence of employment
from monetary policy parameters in Lucas's model thus requires--as Lucas has
recognized (1975, p.lll9)--the proportional-transfer feature of the original
specification.

Conclusions
The foregoing paragraphs demonstrate constructively that it is possible

to devise a linearized version of Lucas's ENN model that retains the original's

main properties yet is comparatively easy to manipulate and modify. The
strategy used in effecting the simplification involves linearization of
relationships implied by the original model under conditions of perfect
foresight or certainty equivalence, with the list of relevant variables and

the informational structure retained intact. This type of procedure could,
it would appear, be similarly applied in the analysis of other nonlinear
stochastic models.

Appendix
The object here is to outline the comparative-static analysis that leads,
under Lucas's (1972) assumptions, to sign restrictions on the coefficients

in equations (19) and (20). Under constraint (18), the agent's perfectforesight problem is to maximize tJ(N-A,N) + V(AR+T) where A, R, and T are

used to denote A'p, 1+1' and the transfer variable
The first-order conditions are U1 +
U2

= 0 and U1 =

(Xi-l)M/Pi.

RV', and their differentials

are
(A-i) U11(dN-dA) + TJ12dN +

1J21(dN-dA) + IJ22dN = 0

(A-2) U11(dN-dA) + IJ12dN = RV"(AdR+RdA-4-dT) + V'dR
From (A-i) we see that

(A-3) (U11-HJ12÷U21÷u22)dN

(U11+U21)dA.

Thus, since U1 + U12 < 0 and U22 +

U21 < 0 by assumption (Lucas, 1972, p.lO6),

dN and dA are of the same sign.
First letting dT

0, we find that

(A-4) ((U11+U21)(U11÷U12) -(U11+V"R2)(U11+U12÷U21÷u22fldA
= (RAV"+V'

)(U11+u12÷U21+1J22)dR.

But since U11U22 -

U12tJ1

> 0 by

strict concavity, the term in brackets on the

left-hand side is unambiguously negative. And since Lucas assumes RAV"+V' > 0
(1972, p.107), The product on the right-hand side is also negative. This
shows that dA/dR > 0 and thus that dN/dR > 0; consequently a1,b1 > 0.
Next letting dR = 0, we obtain

(A-5) f(U11÷U21)(u1112) -(U11+V"R2)(U11+U12+U21+U22)]dA
=
RV"(U11+U12-4-U21-f-1322)dT.

Here e see that RV" < 0 appears in p-lace of RAV"+V' > 0 in (A-4), so we

conclude that dA/dT < 0 and dN/dT < 0. The restrictions in the text
regarding a2, b2, a3, arid b3 follow from the definition of T.

1. A few modifications have, of course, appeared. Noteworthy examples
include Azariadis (1981), Muench (1977), Polemarchakis and Weiss (1977),
and Wallace (1980).

2. In this regard, it is worth mentioning that existing empirical tests
of propositions suggested by the Lucas (1972) model--for example, the
"policy ineffectiveness" hypothesis--have typically been conducted using

specifications taken from these other papers. Leading examples are
provided by Boschen and Grossman (1982), Gordon (1982), and Mishkin (1982).

3. Lucas (1981, pp. 12, 14-15) has suggested that a linearized version of

the ENN model is provided by Lucas (1973). But the relative price
variables in these papers are different--see En. 7 below--and markets

clear locally in the ENN model but not in Lucas (1973). Our linearization
procedure is related to one employed by Lucas (1975) but relies more

heavily on properties of the nonlinear model. Kydland and Prescott (1982)
recently used a rather similar procedure in the context of a numerical

analysis. These linearizations lose, of course, the effects of timevarying conditional variances and higher moments.

4. Our notation is related to Lucas's but is not identical.
5. Note that in this setup the nominal amount of each old agent's monetary
transfer is proportional to that agent's nominal holdings of money.

This feature of the specification gives the non-stochastic version of
the model the property of superneutrality--see Barro and Fischer

(1976, p.140). If transfers were of the lump-sum type, the model's
properties would be different, as will be shown below.

6. These properties include non-inferiority of leisure and consumption when
young, plus differentiability, strict concavity, and a condition on V
which implies that the substitution effect of intertemporal price changes

will dominate the income effect. For details, see Lucas (1972, Pp. 106-109).
7.

It might parenthetically be noted that the variable E(x+i + Pt -

can be interpreted as the expected real rate of return on
money holdings.
In particular,

x1 = log

-

log Mt is the effective nominal interest

rate on money carried from t into t+l, given that transfers are proportional to existing holdings, while

-

Pt

is the corresponding

inflation rate. In addition, we note that this rate-of-return variable

differs from the single relative-price variable Pt -

E(pt1Q

that

appears in the supply functions used by Lucas (1973) and Sargent-wallace

(1975). Barro (1980) uses a different rate—of-return variable while
Barro (1975) uses the same but includes a wealth variable that differs
from x1. Thus these specifications cannot be tightly rationalized by
reference to Lucas's ENN model.

8. Note that the fraction of young agents allocated to island Two is 1 so market clearing requires
2 —

= 1 + (l—®)

= M/(2_).
=

Then the approximation

leads directly to (5).

9. As in most rational expectations models there may be a multiplicity of
solutions. The one here described is the unique bubble-free solution.
For relevant discussion, see McCaLlum (1983).

10. The validity of these assertions is demonstrated in the appendix.

11. Here since Ext+i = 0 we have used the special case restrictions
a3 = b3 = 0
described in the previous paragraph. More generally the coefficient on the
last term in (21) would be -(a1÷a3) and there would be an additional term,

namely, a3Cm

+

- e)1.

Of Course Ext+i

0 is not

equivalent to

1 in the stochastic case, so our restrictions are

only approximately appropriate. The main point of the example would
continue to hold if a3 and b3 were nonzero.
