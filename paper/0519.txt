Labor Market Competition Among Youths, White Women and Others
ABSTRACT

This paper examines labor market effects of increased labor force
participation Of youths and women.

Using 1969 cross-section data for

manufacturing, substitution elasticities for pairs of inputs from agerace-sex aggregates of labor and c?pital are estimated.

Findings include

strong substitution between youths and white females, and complementarity
between many of the remaining inputs.

Then, allowing either rigid or

flexible youth wages, a ten percent increase in white female participation
is simulated.

Findings are respectively:

youth employment and

mode~ate

either a large decrease in

wage decreases of other labor, or moderate

decreases in wages of youths and white women.

Introduction

The two most important phenomena in the labor market in the past
fifteen years have been the influx of large numbers of young workers and the
growth in participation of adult women.

The former is the result of the baby

boom of the 1950s; the latter stems from changes in attitudes, reductions in
discrimination, and lowered prices of substitutes for women's time at home.
Each phenomenon alone could have a substantial impact on the labor market.
In conjunction, their effects are compounded, with each group possibly
affecting the employment opportunities facing the other.
A number of observers have argued that the youth unemployment problem
of the 1970s has been exacerbated by competition for jobs from the growing
number of adult women workers.

One has noted that, "The job prospects of

these youth are adversely affected, if indirectly, by the large supply of
II

women still interested in joining the labor force.
point~d

Another has

out that even in the 1980s "Competition for jobs will be intense and

the three major groups of competitors will consist of young white males,
young black males, and women of all working ages ••

Yet another has

stated, "The growth in labor force participation by adult women probably
diminished the recovery's impact on the unemployment rates of all groups-especially those of teenagers and non-white women."l

Implicit in all these

remarks are two statements about how labor markets work:

(1) Youth and adult

women are close substitutes in production, so that an influx of the latter
shifts the demand curve for youth sharply to the left; and (2) Wage rates of
youth are downward rigid, so that this shift is reflected in increased
unemployment rather than reduced wage rates.
1

Because some research, e.g.,

2
Freeman and Medoff (1978), finds indirect evidence that contradicts this view,
in this study we examine the direct evidence on the extent to which women
and youth are in fact substitutes in production.

The latter issue is ignored,

though some recent evidence suggests it may not be so important a problem as
many observers seem to think.

2

While there have been numerous studies of substitution among workers
of different groups, very few· of these have considered substitution between
age groups, and none has examined substitution among women and youth (see
Hamermesh and Grant, 1979).

3

Only Freeman (1979) includes women workers as a

separate category, and, because men ages 20 through 34 are aggregated, his
estimates tell us little about the issue of substitution between women and
youth.
To fill this gap in our knowledge and provide some substantive basis
for accepting or rejecting the contentions cited above, we estimate substitution possibilities among a set of age-race-sex groups in the labor force.
The estimates are based on cross-section data from SMSAs in 1969, and they
allow us to consider how substitutable adult women are for young women or
young men.

The estimates are used, along with assumptions about the extent

of wage rigidity and elasticities of labor supply, to simulate the direct
and indirect effects of the growth of the female labor force on job
opportunities for youth, assuming rigid wages for young workers, and on the
wage rates of adult males, assuming these wages are flexible.
II.

Estimating Equations, Methods and Data

Our estimates are based upon the trans10g approximation to a production
surface (see Christensen et. al., 1973).

We estimate the production function

using output shares, implicitly assuming that the production function is

3

characterized by constant returns to scale, and firms are price-takers in
factor markets.

The production function is used instead of the cost function

because, at least for older workers, factor quantities are more properly
viewed as exogenous than are factor prices.

(See Hamermesh and Grant, 1979,

for a discussion of exogeneity assumptions appropriate for estimating
production models defined over labor-force subaggregates.)
Let the N-factor production function, Q =F(X1""'~)' be approximated
by the trans10g form:

While most work analyzing production relations has focused on partial
elasticities of substitution and price elasticities (see Allen, 1938), those
concepts are inappropriate if we are interested in considering the effects of
exogenous changes in factor quantities on factor prices.

We therefore

concentrate on the Hicks partial elasticities of complementarity, defined as

supply is exogenous. Obversely, in the more commonly used cost-function
tableau, one must assume all input prices are exogenous.

Since wage flexibility

seems, as noted above, to be a pervasive characteristic of the U.S. labor
market, and since the evidence suggests labor supply is quite inelastic for
most groups of workers, we can be fairly confident that the use of the production function approach is more appropriate than would be the estimation of a

5

Nonetheless, in our study, as in every study that has

estimated production technologies, a general equilibrium approach that
specified supply relationships as part of the model would improve the results
(at the cost of substantial complexity).
The data are constructed for 1969.

Employment data for manufacturing

gathered from issues of the Census of Manufactures and the Annual Survey

250,000 in population in 1970.

67 SMSAs for which all the data could be constructed for the factor inputs

The system of

share equations (2) is then estimated using the iterative Zellner method,
a maximum-likelihood technique, over the cross-section data for manufacturing
in 1969.

In addition to being the first to examine substitution between

youth and adult women, our estimates are among the few that use cross-section
data to estimate parameters from flexible functional forms describing
production relations.
III.

Estimates of Elasticities of Complementarity and of Factor Prices
Before discussing the elasticity estimates based on the parameters

estimated in the cross section for manufacturing in 1969, it is worthwhile
considering whether the complete model in (2) is needed to describe production
relations among the five factors, or whether instead some types of separability
can be imposed.

Most interesting would be if we found that the labor

subgroups are jointly separable from capital.

Though time-series studies

using broad occupational categories (blue-collar and white-collar labor) do
not find this (see Berndt and Christensen, 1974; and Denny and Fuss, 1977),
it may be implied by cross-section data covering the small demographic
subgroups used in this study that are of major interest for labor-market

6

policy.

If so, we can conclude that estimates of the potential impact of such

policies can be simulated without using capital stock data that are often
difficult to construct.
Unfortunately, the imposition of various restrictions implied by weak
separability of various sets of inputs from the others is generally inconsistent with the data.

weak separability in six cases which implicitly test popular notions about
the extent to which various groups are similar.

The only pair of inputs for

which the hypothesis of a consistent aggregate is not rejected is youths and
adult white women.

Youths and adult blacks cannot be treated as an aggregate,

nor can adult blacks and adult white males.

White adult males are also not

separable from other demographic groups, nor are adult white women.

Finally,

and corroborating the results of the several time-series studies that have
tested for separability of (blue- and white-collar) labor from capital, the
hypothesis that they are separable is decisively rejected.

This implies that

studies that do not include measures of the capital stock are likely
producing unreliable estimates of the parameters describing substitution
between the labor subaggregates.

We also find that older blacks and
This result follows unsurprising1y from

the observation that older blacks in manufacturing are mainly adult men who
are likely to be close substitutes for adult white men.

All the other pairs

of labor categories are seen to be complements, though in no case is the
complementarity relationship very strong.
Table 3 shows the elasticities of factor prices computed from the
average fitted factor shares and the partial elasticities of complementarity.
Since these follow from the results in Table 2, substantial additional comment
is not required.

It is worth noting, though, that the largest cross elasticity

between any labor pair is that between the substitutes Y and OFW.
As the results in Tables 2 and 3 show, each labor group is complementary
with inputs of physical capital.

This finding is inconsistent with Freeman's

(1979) time-series results on adult women and adult men.

an occupational classification, but may be inconsistent with their results that

The Effect of an Exogenous Increase in White Female Participation
In this section we examine the impact of a ten percent increase in the

number of white women in the labor force, using the five-factor production

The simulation is designed to gauge the effects of the tremendous increase in
female labor force participation that has occurred since the early 1960s.
Whether employment displacement occurred, or whether the effect has been to
reduce the relative wage rates of youth, depends on whether in fact relative
wage rates of youth are rigid.

In our simulation we calculate the impact of

the increase in adult white female employment under the two extreme assumptions
of completely flexible and completely rigid wages in the youth labor market.

Equations (8) and (9) allow us to use the estimates in Table 2 to
calculate the effect of an increase in adult white female employment on the
employment of youths and on the wage rates of workers in other demographic
groups, under the assumption that youths' wage rates are rigid.

Equation

(8) states simply that the effect on youth employment is larger and more
negative the greater is the extent of q-substitutability of white women and
youths, the larger is the share of white women in output, and the smaller is
the share of youths.

Equation (9) states that the effect on other factor

prices depends both on their partial elasticities of complementarity with
white women and on the degree to which they are q-complements or substitutes
with youths and that youths are q-substitutes with white women.

The simulated effects of a ten percent increase in the labor force of
adult white women are shown in column (1) of Table 4, under the assumption
that the wages of young workers are rigid.

As they show, the ease with which

our estimates in Table 2 imply employers can substitute white women for youths
gives rise to an unbelievably large decrease in the employment of youths in
this simulation.

Moreover, even though white women and adult blacks, and

white women and white men, are complements, the simulated effect of the
increase in the white female labor force is to decrease the wage rates of
adult blacks and white men.
the numer·atar. in

These effects occur because the first term in

(9) outweighs the second due to the relative ease with

which employers can substitute white women for youths.

The rise in adult

white female employment induces a direct increase in the wage rates of its
complements, adult blacks and white men, but this is more than offset by the
induced decline in their wages as employers substitute white women for youths.
If one takes the view that wages of youth are not rigid in the long
run, the appropriate estimates of the effect of the increased female participation are those shown in column (2) of the Table.

These are moderate

decreases in the wage rates of white women and youths, and slight increases
in the wage rates of the other inputs.

These estimates are likely to be

closer approximations to reality under the flexible-wage assumption than are
those in column (1) under the fixed-wage assumption.

This is because the

translog estimates on which they are based are for a production function,
that implicitly assumes that factor quantities are all exogenous, and thus
implicitly is based on a model of flexible wages.
Regardless of whether one believes that wages of young workers are
rigid or flexible, we have shown that, because youths and white women are
substitutes in production, the flow of white women into the labor market has

caused some displacement in the earnings of young workers.

Under the fixed-

wage assumption this displacement would have taken the form of reduced
employment; under the flexible-wage assumption, it would have manifested
itself as a r.eduction in wage rates, and thus a steeper cross-section ageearnings profile than would have otherwise been observed.

Part, perhaps 10

percent, of the sharp relative decline in earnings of young workers that
occurred in the late 1960s and 1970s (see Freeman, 1979, and Welch, 1979) is
thus attributable to the increase in the adult female labor force.

The baby

boom of the 1950s is not the only reason for the relative decline in earnings
in the youth labor force.
VI.

Conclusions

Our estimates and those of Grant (1979) are the first that present
tests for the separability of labor from capital using a disaggregation of
the labor force based on a classification other than by occupation.
results are clear and somewhat depressing:

The

Studies that seek to estimate

the extent of substitution in production among demographic groups must include
measures of the capital stock.

Given the difficulties of constructing such

measures even for the economy as a whole over time, and the near impossibility
of building up a capital measure for nonmanufactvring industries in a cross
section, our ability to derive accurate estimates of substitution parameters
describing the demand ~or labor is limited.

Indeed, because of the inappropriate-

ness of assuming separability, even unbiased estimates of the own-price
demand elasticity for small groups cannot be produced using data on the
group alone.
Our most important finding is the extent to which white women and
youths are substitutes in production.

we

have shown, at least in the

16
~

cross-section data for 1969 that we have used, and assuming the productionfunction approach is the more appropriate one for this disaggregation of the
work force, that market forces change the relative wages received by these
two groups of workers in a direction opposite that of the change in their
relative quantities.

We have also demonstrated that each type of labor in

our age-race-sex disaggregation is complementary with capital, a finding that
is partly consistent with the time-series results for blue-collar and whitecollar labor.

It is inconsistent with past results that are based on the

disaggregation of the labor force by age and that use the inappropriate (for
this disaggregation) cost-function specification.
Our estimates of white female-youth substitution imply strongly that
the growth of the white female labor force has hurt the earnings prospects
of young workers.

Whether this effect has worked through a decrease in

employment or a reduction in wages cannot be determined here.

However, that

it has occurred is the logical conclusion from our finding that these two
groups are easily substituted in production, and the observation that there
has been a sharp increase in adult female labor force participation in the
past fifteen years.

Competition from adult women has very likely had a

negative impact on the labor market for youths.

adjustment in relative wages of youths over the past fifteen years, and Morse
(1980) indicates thaL except for black males, teenage wage rates did adjust
well between 1960 and 1970.

However, Johnson (1980) presents arguments why

one might, in the face of this evidence, believe the youth labor market is
not entirely free of wage rigidity.

Consistent with this view, King (1979)

presents tentative evidence of some effect of increased female participation
on youth unemployment.
3The studies looking at substitution by age are Anderson (1977), Freeman
(1979), Grant (1979), Johnson-Blakemore (1979), and Welch-Cunningham (1978).
4Sato and Koizumi (1973) layout the relationships among the substitu-

'.

tion and complementary elasticities.
5For adult males, and increasingly too for adult females, the evidence
is fairly clear that supply elasticities are nearly zero (see Borjas and
Heckman, 1978).

For other groups this assumption is less tenable.

Further, because most

previous studies, including Grant (1979) and Anderson (1977), present
elasticities of substitution, their finding that each labor type is a psubstitute for capital is not necessarily in conflict with our finding on
their q-complementarity.
llIn an attempt to extend our work beyond manufacturing we estimated
the capital stock in the entire private nonfarm economy in each SMSA by
prorating the manufacturing capital stock by the ratio of hours worked.

would appear that data limitations make it impossible to derive useful crosssection estimates of labor-labor substitution parameters outside manufacturing,
since, as we have shown for manufacturing, a capital measure must be included
where none is available.

Between May 1967 and May 1979 the share of the labor force accounted

for by white women 25+ grew from .243 to .268, roughly a ten percent increase.
Data by age, race, sex and industry cannot be obtained for each year, but we
can note that, as a percent of full-time employees in manufacturing, women
increased from 23.9 to 25.7 percent between 1967 and 1977.

l3Though we wish to simulate employment effects, our estimates are
based on manhours of inputs.

Assuming, as is standard in the literature,

that the exogenous change produces no long-run change in the relative prices
of persons and hours, our estimates are appropriate for simulating the long-run
effect of the influx of women.
14This discussion is modelled after that in Johnson (1980).
