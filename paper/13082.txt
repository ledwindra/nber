When Are Ghettos Bad? Lessons from Immigrant Segregation in the United States

NBER Working Paper No. 13082

JEL No. J15,R2
ABSTRACT
Recent literature on the relationship between ethnic or racial segregation and outcomes has failed to
produce a consensus view of the role of ghettos; some studies suggest that residence in an enclave
is beneficial, some reach the opposite conclusion, and still others imply that any relationship is small.
This paper presents new evidence on this relationship using data on first-generation immigrants in
the United States. Using average group characteristics as instruments for segregation, controlling
for individual characteristics and both metropolitan area and country-of-origin fixed effects, we estimate
impacts of residential concentration that vary with group human capital levels. Residential concentration
can be beneficial, but primarily for more educated groups. The mean impact of residential concentration
varies across measures, which may illuminate some of the causal mechanisms relating segregation
to outcomes.

1. Introduction
Over the past decade, social scientists have devoted a considerable amount of effort to
identifying the effect of neighborhood-level factors on individual outcomes. In response to the
traditional concern regarding families’ endogenous choice of neighborhoods, researchers have
adopted an array of techniques, including simple bounds analyses (Solon, Page and Duncan
2000; Page and Solon 2003), propensity score matching methods (Harding 2003), instrumental
variables (Cutler and Glaeser 1997), quasi- or “natural” experiments (Aaronson 1998;
Oreopoulos 2003; Jacob 2004), and actual randomized controlled trials (Kling and Liebman
2004; see Vigdor 2006 for a review of recent literature on neighborhood effects). From a
scientific perspective, it would be comforting to find a consensus on the direction and magnitude
of neighborhood effects. No such consensus exists. A review of the recent literature finds
considerable heterogeneity in conclusions. While a careful reader could certainly find flaws in
even the most carefully conducted studies to date, a reasonable implication to take from existing
literature is that neighborhood effects are not monolithic in nature: the relationship between
neighborhood characteristics and individual outcomes depends on characteristics both of the
context and of the individual.
Among the most prominent neighborhood characteristics examined in existing literature
is racial or ethnic concentration, often as proxied by a segregation index. Cutler and Glaeser
(1997) find significant negative relationships between segregation and outcomes for AfricanAmericans in 1990. Subsequent research on segregation and outcomes has found either no
association or a reversed relationship, using earlier data on African-Americans (Collins and
Margo 2000) or quasi-experimental evidence on immigrants in Sweden (Edin, Fredriksson and

1

Aslund, 2003). A fair reading of existing evidence, then, suggests that ghettos may be either
good or bad for outcomes.
What determines whether segregation has a positive or negative impact on outcomes?
This paper seeks insight into this question by examining the experiences of immigrant groups in
the United States, utilizing newly computed segregation indices for immigrants of roughly 100
different nationalities living in any of roughly 300 metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs). To
address the important concern that immigrants sort themselves into enclaves nonrandomly, we
employ two basic strategies. The first involves the use of both country-of-origin and MSA fixed
effects. In these specifications, we identify the impact of segregation by comparing groups that
are more and less segregated within a city, relative to their own group-level averages. Second,
we conduct an instrumental variables analysis. Our instrument for segregation is the mean
number of years since immigration for group members in a particular MSA. More recently
arrived groups tend to be less segregated. We control directly for an individual’s years since
immigration, which should directly capture any assimilation effects. We also control for average
group age and education level in the second stage regression.1
Existing literature can be divided into papers directly examining the effects of ethnic
concentration in one’s neighborhood, and to those that concentrate on the effect of average
concentration in one’s MSA. In this paper, we perform both types of analysis. To conduct the
second analysis, we make use of restricted-access Census microdata, employing control
strategies similar to those used in the first analysis. Our instrument for neighborhood
concentration is an imputed variable, equal to the concentration level predicted on the basis of
1 As discussed below, if we violate the exclusion restriction in spite of these efforts, the expected impact is to bias
the results of the IV regressions towards OLS. Results will reveal significant differences between OLS and IV
specifications.

the distribution of individuals by occupation across tracts in an MSA, and for the observed
national occupation distribution of the group in question.
Our results point towards a relationship between segregation and outcomes that
corroborates some earlier findings: segregation tends to have more beneficial effects for groups
with higher levels of average human capital (Edin, Fredriksson and Aslund, 2003; Cutler,
Glaeser and Vigdor 2005a). We also find notable differences between the estimated impact of
segregation and the impact of neighborhood concentration. In many cases, the average effect of
segregation on outcomes is positive, while the effect of neighborhood concentration is negative.
Together, the results imply that residence near, but not in, an enclave can be beneficial to a
certain class of immigrant, perhaps professionals or entrepreneurs who serve the community.
While our motivation to study immigrant ghettos in the United States clearly relates to a
desire to understand the mechanisms underlying ethnic and racial concentration effects more
generally, we should also note that there is a compelling specific reason to study this population
at this time. As Figure 1 indicates, immigrant segregation has been rising in the United States
since the mid-twentieth century. Cutler, Glaeser and Vigdor (2005b) show that only a small
portion of this increase can be attributed to changing characteristics of immigrants themselves; a
larger portion relates to the changing form of American cities and the tendency for immigrants to
participate less fully in the process of suburban sprawl. Rising segregation need not be a public
policy concern if segregation has few or no negative consequences. Results presented here
suggest that at least in some cases, such a sanguine view is not warranted.
Section 2 discusses the potential benefits and costs of ethnic concentration. Section 3
reviews our sources of data and methods. Section 4 presents results, and section 5 concludes.

2. How might ghettos impact immigrants?
Arguments and theoretical models considering the potential impacts of segregation can be
found in the existing literature (Cutler and Glaeser, 1997; Borjas, 1998; Edin, Fredriksson and
Aslund, 2003). In this section, we briefly review the hypothesized benefits and costs of enclave
residence.

2.1 The benefits of segregation
Residence in an enclave community might have beneficial impacts on immigrant’s
income and consumption possibilities. Ethnic density may foster the formation of group-specific
networks that provide access to employment opportunities and transportation. Residential
concentration may also be necessary for groups to form a critical mass necessary to support
group-specific commercial enterprises or community institutions (Waldfogel, 2003). Generally
speaking, the benefits associated with segregation can be thought of as reducing the costs of
assimilation to the host society, primarily by making that process less necessary to economic
success.

2.2 The costs of segregation
While many of the benefits associated with residence in an enclave are immediate in
nature, many of the hypothesized costs accrue over a longer period of time. Enclave
communities are often located in older residential areas, further from suburban areas of job
growth in most MSAs. Thus, while the availability of employment and transportation networks
may assist immigrants in the short run, the relative difficulty of expanding beyond these

4

networks could cause harm in the long run. This hypothesized impact relates to the spatial
mismatch hypothesis (Kain 1968), long discussed as a possible mechanism linking racial
segregation to poor labor market outcomes for African-Americans.
Because of their tendency to be located in older neighborhoods, ethnic enclaves are
disproportionately likely to be served by relatively strained central city or inner-ring suburb
governments. Lower quality of local public goods, particularly primary and secondary
education, may have a strong negative impact on family welfare, albeit one only observed with a
significant time lag. Other local disamenities, such as crime, may impact immigrants more
immediately. Cutler, Glaser and Vigdor (2005b) show evidence that the availability of one
locally-provided public good, transit, may play a disproportionate role in immigrant location
decisions. To the extent that investments in transit crowd out other categories of public
expenditure, enclave residents may suffer in the long run.
Beyond these costs associated with physical location of the ghetto, isolated immigrants
may more generally exhibit reduced rates of economic and cultural assimilation. Exposed
disproportionately to people like themselves, group members may retain group characteristics for
a longer period of time. For less-educated or lower-skilled immigrant groups, this implies lower
future income for present and future generations. For higher-skilled groups, of course, isolation
from the less-skilled majority may actually be beneficial. The impact of segregation on human
capital accumulation quite possibly depends on the characteristics of the segregated group
(Borjas 1998; Edin, Fredriksson and Aslund 2003; Cutler, Glaeser and Vigdor 2005a).
Given the presence of short-term benefits and longer-term costs, an immigrant’s optimal
strategy may be to locate in an enclave community initially, then move out once a certain amount

5

of assimilation has taken place. Indeed, empirical evidence supports the notion that immigrants
tend to reduce their degree of isolation as they spend more time in the host country (Cutler,
Glaeser and Vigdor 2005b, see also the first-stage regressions in Appendix Table A1). The
selection of more-assimilated immigrants out of enclave communities poses a direct challenge to
any efforts to estimate the relationship between segregation and outcomes. Immigrants living in
isolated settings possess observable characteristics associated with more negative socioeconomic
outcomes, it is reasonable to presume that these immigrants possess unfavorable unobserved
characteristics as well. In general, then, we expect simple estimates of the relationship between
segregation and outcomes to be biased downwards. Our strategies for circumventing this bias
are detailed in the following section.
3. Data and Methods
3.1 Basic information
Our study of immigrant segregation and outcomes makes use of information collected in
the US Decennial Census enumeration of 1990.2 The Census contains information on country of
birth for all foreign-born residents; we use this information to categorize immigrants by country
of origin.3 Socioeconomic outcome measures derived from the Census include the logarithm of
earned income in 1989, indicators for whether an individual was either gainfully employed or
enrolled in school in the week prior to the enumeration, and whether a female was a single
2 We use 1990 data here primarily for purposes of comparability with Cutler and Glaeser (1997). Analyses
completed with 2000 Census data, available from the authors on request, show similar patterns to those
presented here.
3 The Census does not collect information on citizenship for foreign-born residents. There is some concern that
the Census severely undercounts immigrants, particularly undocumented or “illegal” immigrants. We imagine
that undocumented immigrants have relatively poor socioeconomic outcomes and have a disproportionate
tendency to locate in immigrant enclaves. Thus, excluding these individuals from our sample should have the
impact of reducing any estimated negative relationship between locations and outcomes. We hesitate to refer to
our coefficients as biased, however, since much of the change in coefficients associated with including
undocumented immigrants would doubtlessly represent selection bias rather than any true treatment effect.

mother. These outcome variables mirror those used in Cutler and Glaeser (1997). As in that
earlier paper, we restrict our attention to individuals between 20 and 30 years of age at the time
of the enumeration, under the hypothesis that this group is more likely to have their residential
location assigned by parental choice, rather than their own individual choice. This is not our
only effort to address possible selection biases; our other efforts are described in more detail
below.
In addition to these outcome measures, we examine three variables pertaining to younger
immigrants. For children between the ages of 9 and 18, we analyze the probability of both
speaking and writing English well. For children between 16 and 18 years of age, we consider the
decision to enroll in school. Finally, for females 13 to 19 years old, we analyze the propensity to
be a teenage mother. Summary statistics for these outcome variables and for the individual-level
covariates controlled for in our analysis appear in Table 1.

3.2 Measuring segregation and ethnic concentration
There are many ways to measure segregation and ethnic concentration, and social
scientists continue to find new, and arguably superior, ways to quantify both constructs (Massey
and Denton 1988; Echenique and Fryer 2005). Our analysis makes use of two segregation
indices, both of which are described in detail in Cutler, Glaeser and Vigdor (1999). The
dissimilarity index, D, is defined as:
(1)

D=

∣

∣

groupi
groupi
1
−non−
−group total
∑
2 i group total
non

where groupi denotes the number of relevant immigrant group members living in neighborhood i,
grouptotal the number living in the entire city or metropolitan area, and non-groupi and non7

grouptotal are similarly defined for residents not belonging to the group in question. Dissimilarity
equals zero in situations where a group forms an equal share of the population in all
neighborhoods, and equals one when a group resides exclusively in neighborhoods where no
non-group members live. Between these extremes, the dissimilarity index can be interpreted as
the share of group members (or non-group members) that would have to switch neighborhoods in
order to achieve an even distribution across the MSA.
While it possesses an intuitive interpretation, the dissimilarity index can easily be
criticized (see, for example, Echenique and Fryer 2005). Among other criticisms, the
dissimilarity index can record a group as being highly segregated even in situations where group
members have extensive neighborhood-level exposure to non-group members. A group located
exclusively in one neighborhood that only forms 10% of the population in that neighborhood, for
example, would have a dissimilarity value close to one in a large MSA. While many alternative
indices have been proposed that lack this undesirable property, our past work (Cutler, Glaeser
and Vigdor 1999) focuses on one in particular, the isolation index. Isolation is defined as
follows:
groupi

groupi
group total
−
population i populationtotal
i
total
(2) I =
group total
grouptotal
min1,
−
populationsmallest
populationtotal

∑ group

×

where groupi and grouptotal are defined as above, populationi and populationtotal represent the
overall population in tract i and the entire city or metropolitan area, and populationsmallest is the
population of the neighborhood with the fewest residents in the city or metropolitan area. At the
extremes, isolation and dissimilarity take on the same values, zero and one. At intermediate

8

values, isolation measures the extent to which the neighborhood-level group share experienced
by the average group member exceeds the level that would be expected under perfect integration.
Either segregation index requires us to operationalize the concept of neighborhood. We
compute segregation using Census tracts, which average 4,000 residents each though population
size varies. Arguments can be made for using either larger or smaller geographic areas as the
unit of analysis; tracts have the advantage that they are defined consistently throughout the
country and have a rich array of demographic data available for analysis in public use summary
files.
Figure 1 displays the time pattern of immigrant segregation since 1910, using the two
indices defined above. The plotted values are averages of immigrant group/city specific
observations, weighted by the number of group members in the city in the indicated year. Both
dissimilarity and isolation have been rising over the past several decades, though the 1990s
witnessed relative stability in dissimilarity levels. Cutler, Glaeser and Vigdor (2005b) analyze
the time series and cross-sectional variation in immigrant segregation over this time period.
Summary statistics for immigrant segregation indices used in the analysis below appear in Table
1.
Segregation indices can be considered a measure of the average degree of neighborhood
concentration experienced by a group member in a particular MSA. The use of this proxy
measure instead of actual neighborhood-level exposure can be justified on two grounds, one
pratical and the other statistical. First, there are very few datasets that provide microdata on
individual outcomes coupled with neighborhood-level geographic identifiers. Segregation
indices serve as an imperfect proxy measure for this neighborhood-level information, capturing

9

the actual neighborhood concentration of each resident with some degree of error. If these
measurement errors are uncorrelated with individual characteristics, no bias should be introduced
into the analysis.
Of course, the decision to locate in a segregated or integrated environment within a
metropolitan area is almost certainly related to a host of individual characteristics. This simple
fact provides the second rationale for using MSA-level segregation indices as a proxy for
neighborhood-level concentration: endogeneity problems are likely to be more severe when
using finer geographic detail. It is easier to argue that individuals choose an MSA without
regard to the degree of segregation than to say that they choose a neighborhood without regard to
racial or ethnic composition.
In section 4.2 below, we present an analysis of the relationship between neighborhoodlevel ethnic exposure and socioeconomic outcomes for immigrants. This analysis makes use of
restricted-access Census microdata, which combine the same set of individual demographic and
socioeconomic information available in public use microdata samples with finer geographic
identification. The following section describes our efforts to address selection bias in this
analysis and the more general study of immigrant segregation and outcomes.

3.3 Addressing selection bias
Estimates of the impact of ethnic concentration on socioeconomic outcomes will be
biased to the extent that individuals with unobservably inferior (or superior) characteristics sort
into more (or less) concentrated neighborhoods, or to MSAs with higher (or lower) average
levels of neighborhood concentration. Previous literature has sought to address this bias in a

10

number of ways, including the analysis of actual randomized neighborhood assignment trials and
the use of quasi- or natural experiments. The estimates we present below adopt a series of
strategies to infer the impact of selection bias on the results.
First, we present results that incorporate both MSA and country-of-origin fixed effects.
With these fixed effects in place, our effects of interest are identified from variation in the extent
of segregation for immigrant groups residing in the same city, except for that variation that stems
from differences in the average segregation level across groups. These fixed effects eliminate
many potential sources of bias. For example, one common concern is that segregation tends to
be higher in older MSAs with a heavier reliance on manufacturing industry, public transit, and
the like. These characteristics may in turn predict worse (or better) outcomes for immigrants.
Fixed effects eliminate this concern. A second example would be a concern that a particularly
uneducated immigrant group shows a tendency to form residential enclaves wherever they
locate, and its members experience poor outcomes regardless of the actual segregation level.
This concern is also addressed with the fixed effects strategy.
The fixed-effects strategy is certainly not flawless. If immigrants with unobserved skill
levels lower than their group-level average tend to sort into ethnically concentrated
environments, wherever they may be, then selection bias will still influence our estimates. Thus,
while we believe the fixed effects strategy addresses many selection concerns, it does not address
all of them. Evidence that estimates with and without fixed effects are substantially similar
would bolster our confidence that selection bias is a relatively minor concern.
To further address selection bias issues, we employ instrumental variable (IV) strategies
in specifications examining both MSA-level segregation and tract-level ethnic concentration. A

11

successful IV research design involves one or more variables that influence segregation but have
no other statistical relationship, causal or otherwise, with the dependent variable. In
specifications examining segregation indices, we instrument for segregation with a measure of
the mean years since immigration for members of a country-of-origin group within a city. There
are two primary concerns regarding the exclusion restriction for these models. First, years since
immigration can be considered a measure of assimilation, which could directly impact outcomes.
To address this, we control separately in the regression for an individual immigrant’s own years
since immigration. A second concern is that employers or other agents may statistically
discriminate against members of a group on the basis of average group characteristics, including
years since immigration. To address this concern, we control directly for two other city/group
level characteristics that are arguably more likely to inspire statistical discrimination: average
age and average education levels. Age is more directly observable than years since immigration,
and education is a more reliable predictor of an individual's skill level. Representative first stage
regression specifications are reported in Appendix Table A1. Immigrant groups tend to be
significantly less segregated as they spend more time in the United States.4
In our tract-level ethnic concentration specifications, we instrument for concentration
with a simulated measure that takes the total number of group members in an MSA, the
distribution of non-group members, the nationwide distribution of occupations for each group,
and the MSA-specific distribution of individuals by occupation across tracts as given. A
predicted concentration level is computed for each group in each tract according to the following
4 One might still maintain that the group’s average years since immigration correlates with some unobserved
individual characteristic. The most likely scenario, arguably, is that immigrants belonging to groups with more
years since immigration are unobservably more assimilated, and should hence have more positive economic
outcomes. In this scenario, the IV results would reflect a bias toward the OLS results, as its central implication –
that residents of less segregated communities are unobservably predisposed to superior outcomes – is identical to
the fundamental concern regarding OLS.

12

formula:
(3) Predicted group size = pijRiOj
where Predicted group size is a t by 1 vector of the simulated number of group members in tracts
indexed t, pij is a (scalar) measure of group j’s population in MSA i, Ri is a t by k matrix listing
the share of persons with occupation k residing within each of the t tracts, and Oj is a k by 1
vector of the distribution of group j members across the k occupations. The predicted tract share
is then computed by dividing predicted group size by the sum of predicted group size and the
actual number of non-group members in the tract. Table A1 lists representative first stage
regression specifications utilizing this instrument; in general it is a very strong predictor of actual
group share. Immigrants tend to locate in neighborhoods that house individuals of similar skill
levels.
4. Results
4.1 The impact of segregation
Tables 2A and 2B present sets of ordinary least squares regression results examining the
relationship between segregation and outcomes for first-generation immigrants in the United
States in 1990. Table 2A uses the dissimilarity index as a segregation measure, and table 2B
focuses on the isolation index. Samples are restricted to individuals in the age ranges specified
at the head of each column; males and females are included in all specifications except those for
single and teen motherhood, which focus on females only.
Using either segregation index as the independent variable of interest, coefficients across
specifications are generally small and equally likely to be of a sign associated with positive or

13

negative impacts of segregation. The sole exception, in both tables, is the specification
examining the logarithm of earned income in the previous year. Both dissimilarity and isolation
have a statistically significant positive association with this outcome. The magnitude of the
estimated effects is sizable; a one-standard deviation increase in dissimilarity, for example,
predicts a 15% increase in earned income.
Coefficients on several other control variables merit at least some discussion here. Each
specification in both tables controls separately for a group’s share of the population, since that
variable correlates with segregation and may have independent effects on outcomes (Cutler,
Glaeser and Vigdor 2005b). In these specifications, group share correlates negatively with youth
outcomes such as English language ability and school enrollment, with statistically significant
coefficients in three out of four cases. Group share associates positively with earned income.
Immigrants who have spent more time in the United States, other things equal, experience
superior labor market and schooling-related outcomes. This could reflect either the impact of
assimilation or the tendency for immigrants with worse labor market outcomes to leave the
country. Outcomes for childbearing-related outcomes do not follow this pattern, which may
indicate age effects that are not properly reflected in our linear control, but might also indicate
assimilation of another form: towards American-style rates of single and teen motherhood.
Other individual characteristics have generally predictable effects on these outcomes.
Higher education levels are associated with better socioeconomic outcomes. Controlling
categorically for year of entry, older immigrants (i.e. those who entered the US at a later age)
have worse outcomes along a number of dimensions, with the exception of earnings – returns to
age in the immigrant population appear to be quite strong. We estimate significant gaps in labor

14

market outcomes for females and immigrants identifying themselves with a racial category other
than white.
Average characteristics of an immigrant’s fellow group members living in the same MSA
show up as significant predictors of most outcomes. Immigrants belonging to older groups fare
better on educational outcomes but worse in the labor market. Given that this analysis focuses
on younger first-generation immigrants, higher average ages might represent a higher proportion
of these individuals’ parents residing in the same MSA. Parents might encourage their children
to receive more education. Parent-generation immigrants, who presumably are less likely to be
employed in entry-level jobs, may be less beneficial when it comes to providing employment
connections.
Immigrants belonging to more educated groups fare better on all outcomes. These effects
may represent true “ethnic capital” type mechanisms (Borjas, 1995), or might simply reflect a
correlation between unobserved individual characteristics and group average characteristics.
Aside from incorporating a few individual- and group-level covariates, the specifications
in Table 2A and 2B do very little to address concerns of endogenous immigrant sorting into
enclave environments. Tables 3A and 3B take a further step in this regard, presenting
coefficients from specifications that incorporate MSA and country-of-origin specific fixed
effects. As in the previous two tables, there are generally few significant links between
segregation, as measured by either dissimilarity or isolation, and the set of outcomes under
consideration. Of the three coefficients appearing significantly, two imply that segregation has
beneficial effects: dissimilarity predicts lower levels of idleness, and isolation predicts greater
English proficiency.

15

Perhaps most notably, the one significant association found in the earlier tables, between
segregation and earned income, is no longer present in these specifications. The apparent
tendency for immigrants to earn more when more segregated can be explained by patterns of
higher earnings in generally more segregated cities, or by a tendency for immigrant groups prone
to segregation to earn more. Within cities and within groups, estimated effects are reduced
substantially in the case of isolation, and appear with an opposite sign (and marginal statistical
significance) in the case of dissimilarity. This pattern indicates the existence of a positive bias in
OLS estimates: immigrants with more favorable unobserved characteristics belong to groups that
tend to be universally more segregated, or reside in cities where immigrant segregation tends to
be higher.
The addition of MSA and country-of-origin fixed effects also reduces the magnitude and
significance of virtually every coefficient on group average characteristics. Of the 24 group
average characteristics coefficients appearing in Tables 2A and 2B, 20 attained some degree of
statistical significance at conventional levels. Comparing Tables 3A and 3B, 23 of these 24
coefficients have either moved towards zero or reversed signs. Of the six coefficients that retain
significance after the addition of fixed effects, four have the opposite sign relative to the original
coefficient in Table 2A or 2B. The general effect of group-level education on outcomes
continues to be positive in most cases. Group-level mean age now appears to have a modest, yet
statistically significant, negative impact on English-speaking ability and an adverse impact on
teen motherhood. For the most part, though, across-group differences in average characteristics
appear to associate much more strongly with individual outcomes than within-group, across-city
differences in average characteristics. This increases our confidence that our instrumental

16

variable strategy, which exploits the strong association between a group-level characteristic and
segregation levels, satisfies the exclusion restriction – that the group-level characteristic has no
other association with the outcomes in question.
Instrumental variable estimates of the mean impact of segregation on outcomes appear in
Tables 4A and 4B. These specifications continue to control for MSA and country-of-origin fixed
effects, as in Tables 3A and 3B. Coefficients from representative first-stage regression
specifications can be found in Appendix Table A1. While the selection concerns enunciated in
section 3.3 above tended to presume a pattern of negative selection into enclave environments,
the preceding results indicate that the bias may work in the other direction as well: segregated
immigrant communities may attract either disproportionately skilled or unskilled immigrants.
Comparing results in Tables 4A and 4B with their OLS counterparts in Tables 3A and 3B
reveals that IV coefficients are more positive (or closer to positive) in eleven of twelve cases.
This pattern is a bit less conclusive than it might at first appear, as three of the dependent
variables are scaled in such a way that positive values are associated with negative outcomes –
being a teen or single mother, or being idle. From this perspective, it is unclear what type of
selection into segregated communities predominates. It should also be noted, however, that in
four of the five cases where coefficient differences point toward positive selection, both OLS and
IV coefficients are statistically indistinguishable from zero. On net, the stronger evidence
supports the selection of less-skilled individuals into enclave communities.
The four significant coefficients on segregation indices in tables 4A and 4B are found in
specifications examining two dependent variables: the English ability of young first-generation
immigrants and the logarithm of earnings for young adults. Both of these dependent variables

17

had shown at least some evidence of a relationship with segregation in prior specifications. The
magnitudes associated with these coefficients are generally reasonable: a one-standard deviation
increase in isolation predicts a 1.7 percentage point increase in the probability of speaking and
writing English, and a 5.4% increase in earned income. Overall, the IV results suggest that
immigrant ghettos are beneficial, improving the economic outcomes of immigrants while
actually accelerating the assimilation of immigrant children. Residential concentration may
improve language acquisition for foreign-born children by fostering the development of
specialized curricular programs in local public schools. Two important questions remain,
however. Are ghettos equally benign for all immigrant groups? Does the analysis of segregation
and outcomes really give us an accurate portrait of the true impact of living in a concentrated
ethnic enclave? The remainder of this section addresses these two questions.
4.2 The impact of neighborhood-level group share
The primary practical obstacle to the direct analysis of the effects of neighborhood ethnic
concentration on socioeconomic outcomes is the lack of microdata with sufficient geographic
detail to link individuals to neighborhoods. This obstacle can be surmounted with restrictedaccess Census microdata made available by the Census Bureau through its Regional Data Center
program. Table 5 presents an analysis using these data, relating the neighborhood-level ethnic
concentration experienced by foreign-born residents of the United States to a series of
educational and labor market outcomes.5 These specifications employ both metropolitan area
and country-of-origin fixed effects, and are thus most comparable to the segregation index-based

5 Fertility-related outcomes are not included in this analysis, primarily because our initial application to use the
RDC restricted-access household dataset did not explicitly mention these outcomes. Census Bureau
confidentiality rules also prohibit the disclosure of results utilizing cell sizes below a specific value.

18

estimates presented in Tables 3A and 3B.
In each reported specification, the share of a respondent's Census tract belonging to the
same country-of-origin group appears as a significant predictor of labor market and educational
outcomes. In three of four cases, the estimated effect is adverse. Young adult immigrants
residing in more concentrated neighborhoods are more likely to be idle, and report lower
earnings. Immigrant children residing in such neighborhoods are less likely to speak and read
English proficiently, but more likely to be enrolled in school at ages 16 through 18. Each of
these results holds controlling for the same set of individual- and group-level covariates used in
earlier specifications.
The strength of these results represents a marked contrast with the generally inconclusive
patterns observed in Tables 3A and 3B. In only one instance does a significant tract share
coefficient in Table 5 coincide with a significant segregation index coefficient in the earlier
tables: dissimilarity was estimated to have a moderately significant negative impact on earnings
in Table 3A. This lack of concordance sounds a cautionary note for studies employing
segregation indices as explanatory variables in studies of socioeconomic outcomes: while these
indices serve as summary statistics for neighborhood-level indicators, they generally do a poor
job of replicating the results obtained with true neighborhood-level data.
There are serious threats to causal interpretation of the coefficient estimates in Table 5.
While these regressions control for a number of individual characteristics, as well as MSA and
group fixed effects, individual sorting on unobservables into neighborhoods with varying ethnic
concentration could still produce inconsistency here. In Table 6, we provide instrumental
variable estimates that essentially exploit the tendency for American metropolitan areas to be

19

economically segregated, and for immigrant groups to form an unrepresentative socioeconomic
sample of the broader population.
Instrumental variable estimates continue to show strong, statistically significant
associations between tract share and the English ability of child immigrants, and between tract
share and the earnings of young adult immigrants. A ten percentage point increase in share
predicts a 1 percentage point decrease in the probability of English fluency, and a 2.7% reduction
in earnings. In the other two specifications, the statistical significance realized in OLS estimates
is eliminated. Comparison of OLS and IV estimates provides no uniform signal regarding the
direction of bias in OLS. Effects appear less favorable in three out of four specifications, with
the exception being idleness: a significant association in OLS is replaced with an insignificant
relationship in the IV model. The preponderance of evidence suggests that individuals
predisposed towards positive outcomes choose to reside in enclave neighborhoods.
4.3 Heterogeneity of effects
Not all ghettos have the same impact on their residents: this is the simple logical
conclusion of existing research on the subject, which has found a combination of positive,
negative, and null impacts. Following previous work on the subject, the regression specifications
in Table 7 test for a simple form of heterogeneity in the effect of dissimilarity and isolation on
outcomes. In this table, dependent variables appear in rows and each pair of columns represents
a different regression specification. The table reports OLS-fixed effect results and IV results
pertaining to both the Dissimilarity and Isolation indices. The first coefficient reported in each
pair is the main effect of segregation, the second is the coefficient on the interaction of
segregation with the average education level variable included as a covariate in earlier analyses.
20

The main effect can thus be interpreted as the impact of segregation on an immigrant group
where the mean level of education is zero. The interaction term identifies the change in the
marginal impact of segregation associated with a one-year increase in average education levels.
In IV specifications, both the main effect and interaction term are instrumented for, with the
mean years-since-immigration variable and its interaction with mean education.
The OLS specifications in this case reveal very few significant patterns. The two sets of
results that do appear link the most positive impacts of segregation to the lowest-education
groups. These effects are significant only at the 10% level, and both are directly contradicted by
evidence available in the corresponding IV specification.
In instrumental variables specifications, a fairly consistent result pattern emerges in the
analysis of three dependent variables: English ability, single motherhood, and the logarithm of
earned income. Segregation, whether measured by dissimilarity or isolation, predicts worse
outcomes for groups with the least education, and better outcomes for highly educated groups.
Depending on the particular point estimates, the crossover from negative to positive segregation
effects occurs at mean education levels between 10th grade and minimal post-secondary
education. Thus, isolation in an enclave where most adults have post-secondary degrees appears
beneficial in many respects, while isolation in an enclave where most adults have education
below minimum domestic standards appears harmful.
Table 8 presents results of analogous specifications that interact tract-level group share
variables with group mean education levels, utilizing restricted-access Census microdata.
Coefficients derived from OLS specifications with MSA and country-of-origin fixed effects, like
their Table 7 counterparts, are generally inconclusive. Interaction terms are insignificant in three

21

of four specifications, and main effects suggest widely varying impacts of ethnic concentration
on outcomes for low-skilled immigrant groups. As in the previous table, IV estimates present a
more consistent picture. In three of four specifications, neighborhood-level ethnic concentration
displays a statistically significant moderated relationship with individual outcomes, with more
negative effects occurring among groups with lower average education levels. Among low
skilled groups, ethnic concentration is associated with lower English fluency, lower earnings,
and higher rates of idleness. These associations weaken as the skill level of the group increases.
Around the population average of 10 years of education, implied effects are close to zero in all
cases. These effects are generally consistent with the evidence derived from segregation indices
presented in Table 7.
Overall, the results presented in this section indicate that the effects of ethnic
concentration are dependent on the skill level of the group in question. Moreover, the use of
segregation indices as a summary measure of ethnic concentration produces the most reliable
results in specifications that permit this form of effect heterogeneity.
5. Conclusions
Ghettos are neither monolithically good nor bad. Existing literature points toward this
conclusion, and the evidence presented in this paper supports it. The total impact of residence in
an ethnic enclave depends on the characteristics of the individuals who are isolated in it. Groups
with high average levels of human capital appear to benefit from segregation, while lesseducated communities suffer.
A second implication of this paper is that a study of the mean impact of segregation may
provide a misleading estimate of the actual impact of residing in an enclave neighborhood.
22

While many estimates point towards a positive average impact of segregation on outcomes for
immigrant groups in the United States, equivalent estimates focusing on neighborhood-level
ethnic concentration reach the opposite conclusion. Both estimates based on analysis of
segregation and of actual neighborhood concentration support the conclusion that isolation is less
harmful for more-skilled ethnic groups.
