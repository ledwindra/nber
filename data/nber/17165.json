    "abstract": "\n\nWe consider the influence of household-based production on human capital investment. In data from rural Burkina Faso, we document a positive correlation between the presence of girls and enrollment that disappears in households that are able to send out or receive in children. We argue that the connection between education and the sex composition of co-resident children in households that are constrained in their ability to adjust child labor owes to residential rivalry, the idea that having a greater share of resident children with an advantage in household based production increases education by reducing the within-household equilibrium value of child time.\n\n",
