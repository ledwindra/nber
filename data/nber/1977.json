If\ncomplete contingent markets do not exist, it is desirable for governments to\nadopt some trade policies to share the production risk. A full information\npolicy involves income transfers across countries, which can be achieved by\nequal import tariffs and export subsidies. With incomplete information we\nconsider incentive compatible trade policies, which are designed to be truth\nrevealing while partially sharing the production risk. In this case the\ntariff in one country may differ from the export subsidy abroad.\n\n",
