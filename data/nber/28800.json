    "abstract": "\n\nAn AI analyst we build to digest corporate financial information, qualitative disclosure and macroeconomic indicators is able to beat the majority of human analysts in stock price forecasts and generate excess returns compared to following human analyst. In the contest of \u201cman vs machine,\u201d the relative advantage of the AI Analyst is stronger when the firm is complex, and when information is high-dimensional, transparent and voluminous. Human analysts remain competitive when critical information requires institutional knowledge (such as the nature of intangible assets). The edge of the AI over human analysts declines over time when analysts gain access to alternative data and to in-house AI resources. Combining AI\u2019s computational power and the human art of understanding soft information produces the highest potential in generating accurate forecasts. Our paper portraits a future of \u201cmachine plus human\u201d (instead of human displacement) in high-skill professions.\n\n",
