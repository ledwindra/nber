ABSTRACT
Recent empirical work shows large consumption responses to house price movements. This is at
odds with a prominent theoretical view which, using the logic of the permanent income
hypothesis, argues that consumption responses should be small. We show that, in contrast to this
view, workhorse models of consumption with incomplete markets calibrated to rich crosssectional micro facts actually predict large consumption responses, in line with the data. To
explain this result, we show that consumption responses to permanent house price shocks can be
approximated by a simple and robust rule-of-thumb formula: the marginal propensity to consume
out of temporary income times the value of housing. In our model, consumption responses
depend on a number of factors such as the level and distribution of debt, the size and history of
house price shocks, and the level of credit supply. Each of these effects is naturally explained
with our simple formula.

Introduction

A growing empirical literature argues that house price movements can have large effects on
consumption. This finding gives support to a widespread policy concern that boom-bust cycles
in house prices can end with large contractions in consumer spending.1 However, the theoretical
rationale for house price effects on consumption is less clear. In particular, it is a commonly held
view that these effects should be small, because increases in the value of an individual’s house are
offset by increases in future implicit rental costs, leaving the expected lifetime budget constraint
unchanged. If households make consumption decisions based on the expected net present value
of their resources, as in the basic permanent income hypothesis model, then consumption effects
should be small.2
In this paper, we explore the effects of house prices on consumption in a more realistic
workhorse incomplete markets model with income and house price uncertainty. Our baseline
model includes a fixed adjustment cost of trading houses, the choice between renting and owning,
and the possibility to borrow against the value of the house. The model is able to match a
variety of life-cycle and cross-sectional facts on the distribution of wealth, leverage, and housing.
In contrast to the basic permanent income model: (i) Our model produces large aggregate
consumption responses to house price changes—the elasticity of aggregate consumption to a
two-standard deviation (9.2%) increase in house prices is 0.23, in line with the recent empirical
literature; (ii) The size of these responses depends crucially on the economy’s joint distribution
of housing and debt; (iii) The response of consumption to a house price shock today depends
on the history of previous house price shocks.
What explains these results? To provide intuition, we begin by deriving a simple formula
for the individual consumption response to an unexpected, permanent house price shock in a
special case of our model with no adjustment costs in housing. In this case, we show that the
consumption response is given by the marginal propensity to consume out of temporary income
shocks (MPC) times individual housing values (PH). The aggregate response is then determined
by the endogenous joint distribution of MPC and PH. Three assumptions are crucial for this
result: no adjustment costs in housing, Cobb-Douglas utility, and permanent house price shocks.
Under these three assumptions, we show that three effects of house prices on consumption
decisions cancel each other out: the collateral effect, the substitution effect, and the ordinary
income effect due to changes in future implicit rental costs. The only remaining effect of house
prices on consumption is the endowment income effect coming from the revaluation of the initial
1

See Mian et al. (2013) and Cerutti et al. (2015).
Sinai and Souleles (2005) p. 773 clearly formulate this view: “increases in house prices reflect a commensurate
increase in the present value of expected future rents” and “for homeowners with infinite horizons, this increase
in implicit liabilities would exactly offset the increase in the house value, leaving their effective expected net
worth unchanged.” Similar arguments are made in Glaeser (2000), Campbell and Cocco (2007), and Buiter
(2008), which is emphatically titled “Housing Wealth isn’t Wealth”.

housing endowment, and this effect works just like a transitory shock to income.
The assumption of no adjustment costs is needed for our simple formula to hold exactly,
but we show that the formula still holds approximately in our baseline model with adjustment
costs.3 In that context, the formula then provides a good rule of thumb that can be used to
map the quantitative analysis of house price effects to the much better understood analysis
of MPCs.4 To show the goodness of the approximation, for each household in the model we
compute both the actual elasticity of consumption to house price shocks and the approximate
elasticity computed with the rule-of-thumb formula. The cross-sectional variation in actual
elasticities is large, ranging from 0 to almost 1, and the rule-of-thumb approximation is quite
accurate: regressing actual elasticities on approximate elasticities produces and R2 of 0.95.
Next, we use our formula to explain a variety of results in our baseline model and how
they contrast with results in simpler models. For example, the basic permanent income model
with no income uncertainty and no borrowing constraints generates small MPCs that have
little correlation with housing. In contrast, our baseline model features income uncertainty and
borrowing constraints, which increase MPCs, and the presence of leverage makes MPCs strongly
correlated with housing values. Our baseline model also generates consumption elasticities that
vary substantially with income, age, housing, liquid assets and rental decisions, each of which can
be explained by how MPC and PH jointly vary with these variables. For example, responses
in the model are first increasing then decreasing in income. The reason is that low income
households tend to rent, in which case they have PH = 0 and so a zero response.5 Households
with higher income tend to own using substantial leverage, leading to higher values of both PH
and MPC, while agents with the highest income still tend to own but are less levered, leading
to lower MPCs. Finally, aggregate elasticities can depend on the size and direction of house
price shocks, which can be understood through our formula since the presence of borrowing
constraints makes MPCs depend on the sign and size of income shocks.
We explore a number of extensions of our baseline model to show that consumption responses
remain both large and well-explained by our rule-of-thumb formula under a variety of assumptions. The most important extension is the introduction of long-term mortgages. For simplicity
our baseline model assumes one-period frictionless debt. In reality, home-equity extraction is
costly, mortgages are long-term, and loan-to-value constraints only bind at origination. This
means that lenders cannot demand new collateral even if house price declines push households
underwater. In important recent work, Ganong and Noel (2016) present empirical evidence
that underwater borrowers respond little to mortgage debt relief unless it affects current budget
3

In extensions, we also show that our rule of thumb is robust to relaxations of the other two assumptions:
Cobb-Douglas utility (in Section 5.3) and permanent house price shocks (in Section 7).
4
Note that the calculation of MPCs still requires solving the model, so our rule of thumb is not a computational
tool but rather a tool for interpreting quantitative consumption responses to house price movements.

We discuss the intuition for zero renter response in detail in the body of the paper.

constraints, suggesting that our rule of thumb does not work well when households are underwater. In order to address these issues, we introduce long-term amortizing mortgages with costly
refinancing. We find that the accuracy of our formula remains good overall, with an R2 of 0.9 in
the regression of actual elasticities on approximate elasticities. But consistent with Ganong and
Noel (2016), the rule of thumb breaks down for underwater households since these households
have very high MPCs but have little response to house price shocks. This is an important caveat
to our rule of thumb and shows that it does not work for all households in all situations. This
is an important caveat to our rule of thumb and shows that it does not work for all households
in all situations. However, such highly leveraged households represent a very small share of
households during normal times, and even during the Great Recession, most households still
had substantial housing equity. This means allowing for long-term debt does not have a large
effect on the accuracy of our formula at the aggregate level.
We view our rule-of-thumb formula largely as an analytical device rather than as a tool for
measuring housing wealth effects in the data, but in the paper we also explore the measurement
of our rule-of-thumb statistic in micro data. By constructing measures of the MPC by housing
values using PSID data, we are able to construct a microeconomic estimate of our rule-ofthumb formula. This provides both an over-identification test of our quantitative model as
well as an alternative empirical measure of housing wealth effects that relies only on the broad
structure of this class of models. Reassuringly, we find that this microeconomic estimate is
highly consistent with our baseline model and is in line with empirical estimates using completely
different identification strategies, such as those in Mian et al. (2013).
Most of our paper focuses on impact effects of house prices on consumption, in a stationary
environment. The final section then moves beyond impact effects and also explores out-ofsteady-state dynamics. First, we show that the impact effects described by our rule of thumb
are useful for understanding the entire impulse response function. More specifically, we compute
the full impulse response function of consumption to a house price shock as we change model
parameters such as the level of credit supply or house price growth, and we show that impact
effects move in lock-step with the entire impulse response function. In particular, raising credit
supply or house price growth monotonically shifts the impulse response function up, leading to
greater consumption responses both on impact and at future dates.
We next show that dynamics can lead to important time-varying responses of consumption
to house price shocks. For example, we simulate a house price boom in our model and show that
consumption becomes progressively more sensitive to house price shocks as the boom proceeds.
This can be understood using our rule of thumb since higher house price growth leads households
to purchase more housing using debt, which in turn raises MPCs. Interestingly, the strength
of this effect depends crucially on household expectations: consumption sensitivity rises much
more over housing booms in which households expect high house price growth to persist, since
3

this leads to a larger increase in housing demand and leverage. The fact that the endogenous
distribution of housing and debt matters for the strength of house price effects is important for
interpreting empirical evidence from different time periods and when contemplating potential
policy intervention into housing markets. Both shocks and policy interventions may have effects
on consumption that differ dramatically with the distribution of household state-variables at
the time the policy is enacted. In this sense, our result joins a growing literature arguing that
the economy may exhibit time-varying responses to aggregate shocks.6
Finally, we explore the role of house price persistence for our results. When house price
shocks are less than fully persistent, we actually find moderately larger consumption responses
on impact,7 but that total consumption responses are somewhat reduced since effects wear
off more rapidly with transitory shocks. However, quantitative magnitudes are generally quite
similar to the permanent shocks explored in the rest of the paper for plausible parameter values.
Our paper is motivated by the empirical literature studying house price effects on consumption. While methodological and data differences have led to a wide range of estimates for the
relationship between house prices and consumption, the literature has generally found strong
relationships. Whether or not such relationships are causal is more contentious, but recent
papers with new sources of identification have argued for such causality.8 We contribute to this
debate both by showing that theory is completely consistent with large causal effects and by
constructing an empirical measure of these effects using our rule-of-thumb formula.
The first empirical studies of the relationship between consumption and house prices focused
on aggregate data and typically found elasticities of 0.1 to 0.2.9 The greatest challenge for these
studies is finding exogenous variation in house prices which can be used to separate direct house
price effects on consumption from the effects of common factors. For example, expectations
about future income growth may drive both house prices and consumption.10 A number of recent
papers have used micro level evidence to confront this identification challenge. For example,
Mian et al. (2013) use credit card data together with the Saiz (2010) housing supply instrument
to isolate the effects of exogenous changes in house prices on local measures of spending.11 Their

and Caballero and Engel (1999) and Winberry (2015) for applications to investment.
7
This is because households can take advantage of partially predictable house price movements by selling/buying housing and repurchasing/reselling it in the future.
8
While there are different ways of measuring housing price effects, for consistency we will focus the discussion
on estimates of the consumption elasticity to house prices—the percentage change in non-durable consumption
due to a one percent change in house prices.
9
Case et al. (2013) find elasticities from 0.03 to 0.18, with most of the their estimates centered around 0.10,
while Carroll et al. (2011) find an immediate (next-quarter) elasticity of 0.047, with an eventual elasticity of
0.21. They report results in terms of MPCs of 2 and 9 cents (in 2007 dollars) respectively. In 2007, housing
assets from the Flow of Funds were $22,830.5 billion and personal consumption expenditures from the BEA were
$9,750.5 billion. Multiplying MPCs by this ratio delivers the reported elasticities.

baseline estimates of the non-durable consumption elasticity are between 0.13 and 0.26.12 We
view these estimates as the closest empirical analogue to the direct house price effects in our
theory, so we will often compare our theoretical results to these numbers. Several recent papers
such as Kaplan et al. (2016) and Stroebel and Vavra (2016) also arrive at similar numbers using
new scanner spending data and additional identification strategies.
Our paper is part of a large literature studying the theoretical response of consumption to
house prices in quantitative heterogeneous agent models. A number of papers have explored
increasingly rich models with housing and debt, using them to both address aggregate questions
and draw cross sectional predictions, e.g., Carroll and Dunn (1998), Campbell and Cocco (2007),
and Attanasio et al. (2011).13 More recently, models with these features have been embedded
into general equilibrium frameworks, to study the role of households’ balance sheets and debt
capacity in the Great Recession.14 In particular, several papers have pointed to house values
as prime determinants of households’ debt capacity.15 Gorea and Midrigan (2017) study the
effects of illiquid housing on consumption and savings. Huo and Rı́os-Rull (2013) and Kaplan
et al. (2016) build heterogeneous agent equilibrium models with endogenous house prices.
We view our theoretical analysis as highly complementary to this line of work. Our ruleof-thumb formula and decompositions help identify the channels at play and show the crucial
role of the endogenous distribution of housing and debt for the size of house price effects. Our
analysis is conducted taking house prices and income as given. As emphasized by Kaplan et al.
(2016), house prices are equilibrium objects, which complicates the interpretation of correlations
between house prices and consumption. This is because structural shocks which move house
prices may themselves have direct effects on consumption so that the simple correlation between
house prices and consumption will reflect both the causal effect of house prices on consumption
plus any confounding effect from the underlying structural shock. In this paper, we are interested
in whether housing markets themselves play an important role in shaping consumption and
propagating underlying shocks. As such, we want to isolate the causal effects of house price
movements, which fundamentally require modeling housing, from any confounding effects of
structural shocks on consumption, which occur independently of housing. If housing markets
12

They report estimates between 0.5-0.8. However, given their methodology these estimates need to be scaled
by housing wealth/total wealth to be comparable to the other estimates listed above. Since the mean housing
wealth to total wealth ratio in their data is between 0.25-0.33, this implies elasticity estimates ranging from 0.13
to 0.26. Although these estimates can be interpreted as consumption responses to exogenous house price shocks,
it is important to note that they are not pure partial equilibrium responses, since they reflect both direct house
price effects plus any local general equilibrium responses. In particular, they include the additional effect on
consumption due to increases in local incomes driven by greater non-tradable spending.
13
While the focus is very different, similar models have also been used to explore housing choice with borrowing
constraints in Cocco (2005) and Yao and Zhang (2005).
14
Good examples are Favilukis et al. (2015) and Chen et al. (2013). Early work in this direction—that does
not model housing—includes Hall (2011), Guerrieri and Lorenzoni (2011), Eggertsson and Krugman (2012).

play a causal role in shaping consumption, then disruptions in these markets can potentially
cause broader business cycle downturns. Importantly, isolating the causal effects of house price
shocks on consumption requires eliminating all confounding factors by holding other prices and
shocks constant, so this is the approach we take throughout the paper. Since there are strong
relationships between house prices and consumption in our model when holding all confounding
factors constant, this means our model implies an important causal effect of house prices on
consumption. Importantly, our rule-of-thumb formula measures the strength of this causal effect
and how it changes with economic conditions or across models. It does not provide a formula for
the simple correlation between house prices and consumption in equilibrium, which will depend
on the underlying structural shocks which drive house prices.
Our emphasis on simple rules of thumb and sufficient statistics connects our paper to recent
work by Auclert (2015). Work in public finance has widely developed the use of sufficient statistics to characterize welfare effects and optimal policy (see Chetty (2009)).16 In macro, the idea
is to use a similar approach to express aggregate responses to some hard to identify aggregate
shock in terms of individual level statistics which can potentially be more easily measured. Of
course, some further steps may be necessary to translate partial equilibrium responses into general equilibrium effects. However, we see this as a promising avenue to investigate increasingly
complex heterogeneous agents models and connect them to the data.
The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows: In Section 2 we present the baseline model,
calibrate it, and compute baseline consumption response to house price shocks. In Section 3
we derive our rule-of-thumb formula in the model with frictionless housing in which it holds
exactly. Section 4 goes back to the full model with adjustment costs, shows the accuracy of
the rule-of-thumb formula and uses it to interpret a variety of results in that model. Section 5
shows that these conclusions hold under a variety of robustness checks including the presence
of long-term debt and relaxing the Cobb-Douglas utility specification. Section 6 estimates our
rule of thumb directly in micro data as an over-identification test of our model. Finally, Section
7 introduces dynamics and shows that the model can generate substantial time-variation in the
strength of house price effects on consumption.

Baseline Model

We consider a dynamic, incomplete markets model of household consumption. Households have
finite lives and face uninsurable idiosyncratic income risk. The main distinguishing feature of
the model is that households trade houses that provide housing services but which are subject
to adjustment costs and they can borrow against the value of their houses.
16

This approach has also been applied to characterizing optimal macro and financial policy; c.f. Davila (2016).

2.1

Set Up

Time is discrete and runs forever. There is a constant population of overlapping generations of
households, each living for J periods. The first Jy periods correspond to working age, the next
Jo periods to retirement.
Households invest in two assets: a risk-free asset and housing. Let Ait and Hit denote the
holdings of the two assets by household i at time t. The risk-free asset is perfectly liquid and
yields a constant interest rate r. Housing yields housing services one-for-one, depreciates at
rate δ, and trades at the price Pt . In most our analysis we assume that house prices follow a
geometric random walk with drift: Pt = xt Pt−1 , where xt is an i.i.d. shock with E[xt ] = eµ
so that µ is the trend growth rate of house prices.17 Assuming a random walk simplifies our
analysis, but in Section 7, we show that modeling house prices as an autoregressive process with
mean reverting shocks delivers similar results for empirically realistic degrees of persistence.
We assume that in each period a household must choose whether to be a homeowner or
a renter. Renters pay a flow rental cost Rt per unit of housing services. Rental housing can
be adjusted costlessly but cannot be used as collateral. We assume that the rental cost Rt is
proportional to house prices, Rt = φPt . That is, in our baseline, we assume a constant price-rent
ratio which takes on parameter value φ.18 In Section 5.3, we show that elasticities are mildly
amplified if we instead make the opposite extreme assumption that Rt is fixed while Pt varies,
so that our baseline choice is relatively conservative.
In contrast to rental housing, we assume that buying and selling houses is costly, to match
the fact that households trade houses only infrequently.19 We model adjustment costs as a fixed
cost, incurred whenever the household changes its stock of housing. In particular, if household
i decides to trade housing at time t, it pays a cost proportional to the value of the house sold
κit = F · Pt Hit−1 1Hit 6=Hit−1 , where 1 is an indicator function equal to 1 if Hit 6= Hit−1 .
In addition to providing housing services, owner occupied housing can be used as collateral
for borrowing. In particular, households can borrow but must satisfy the borrowing constraint

National house prices series are highly persistent in FHFA, Case-Shiller and CoreLogic. The exact value
depends on the particular series, time window and price deflator used but across a variety of choices, real house
prices exhibit annual persistence of between 0.93 and 0.96, and a random walk cannot be rejected.
18
At retirement, income risk falls to zero. This substantially changes the trade-off between liquid and illiquid
assets. With a constant rental rate this would imply a large jump up in the homeownership rate at retirement. To
eliminate this jump, we introduce a different rental-to-price ratio at retirement φ̂ < φ, and we pick this additional
parameter to match homeownership rates after retirement. This is isomorphic to a lower utility of housing in
retirement, perhaps due to no longer having children at home or to greater challenges to home maintenance. We
concentrate on results for working-age households, so φ̂ has little effect on any of our results.
19
Berger and Vavra (2015) show that the average annual frequency of housing adjustment in the PSID is 4.3%
in data from 1968-1996 and 5.8% in data from 1999-2011.

that adjusts for changes in the cost of housing.
The assumption of Cobb-Douglas preferences for non-durable consumption and housing services plays an important role in simplifying computations and for interpreting some of our
results. While estimates of the elasticity of substitution between non-durables and housing
based on macro data are somewhat varied, more relevant evidence from micro data consistently
finds support for an elasticity close to unity (Piazzesi et al. (2007), Davis and Ortalo-Magné
(2011), and Aguiar and Hurst (2013)). Furthermore, in Section 5.3 we show quantitative results
are robust to using using CES preferences with elasticity of substitution in a reasonable range.
Households face an exogenous income process. Working age households have income

Yit = exp{χ(jit ) + zit },
where χ(jit ) is a deterministic age-dependent parameter, jit is the age of household i at time t,
and zit is a transitory shock that follows an AR(1) process
zit = ρzit−1 + εit .
When the household is retired, income is given by a social security transfer, which is a function
of income in the last working-age period, which we specify following Guvenen and Smith (2014).
The full household problem and computational solution are detailed in Appendix A.4.

The baseline model parameters are shown in Table 1. The model is annual. We interpret
the first period of life as age 25.21 Households work for Jy = 35 years (between 25 and 59) and
are retired for Jo = 25 years (between 60 and 84). We set the interest rate r = 2.4%.22 In our
baseline calibration, we use a coefficient of relative risk aversion σ equal to 2.23
We assume that our permanent house price shocks xt ∼ N (µ, σP ). House price movements
in our model should be interpreted as aggregate shocks since they affect both the price of a
household’s existing house but also the price of any new house that household might purchase.
As such, we calibrate our house price process by setting µ = .012 and σP = .0459 to match the
annual standard deviation and real growth rate of aggregate house prices in FHFA data.24 In
Section 5.2 we show that instead calibrating to match the larger standard deviation of house
prices observed within highly disaggregated census tracts has little effect on our results.25
We choose a depreciation rate of housing δ = 2.2% to match the depreciation rate in BEA
data from 1960-2014. The collateral constraint parameter θ determines the minimum mortgage
down payment, and we choose a value of 0.2 in our baseline calibration.26 We also set F = 0.05.
This transaction cost is equal to the value of housing adjustment costs calibrated in Dı́az and
Luengo-Prado (2010) and is close to the adjustment costs of 0.0525 estimated in Berger and
Vavra (2015) for a broad measure of durable spending. In addition, we show below that our
conclusions are not particularly sensitive to changes in the size of this cost.
The working age income process has a life-cycle and a transitory component. The life-cycle
component is chosen to fit a quadratic regression of yearly earnings on age in the PSID as in
21

We begin the model at this age in order to abstract from complications with schooling decisions.
We target interest rates from 1990-2000, which we view as the steady-state for our simulations but results
are not sensitive to the level r.

Using other reasonable values of σ did not substantively change our conclusions.

This data contains nominal house prices from 1991-2016. We compute real house price growth deflating by
the CPI. Deflating by the PCE or GDP deflator delivers slightly larger growth rates. Using alternative house
price series from Corelogic or Case-Shiller also delivers similar parameter values.
25
There are nearly 70,000 census tracts, and each tract typically contains only 4,000 households, so they are
more disaggregated than the 45,000 zip codes in the U.S.
26
In reality, many mortgages originate with down payments less than 20%. Using a lower θ amplifies the size
of consumption responses.

z follows an AR1 process with autocorrelation ρz = 0.91 and standard deviation σz = 0.21 to
match PSID earnings statistics (after removing life-cycle components). In retirement, households
receive a social security income payment which is modeled as in Guvenen and Smith (2014).
We choose the remaining parameters jointly to match life-cycle profiles of housing wealth,
non-housing wealth and homeownership in the data. Namely, from the 2001 Survey of Consumer
Finances (SCF) we compute average housing wealth and average liquid wealth net of debt for
households in 9 age bins (25-29, 30-34, ..., 60-64, 65 and over).27 Our model is very stylized
for retired agents since they face no sources of risk. Therefore, we focus our calibration and
predictions on working-age agents. Our notion of liquid wealth net of debt in the SCF excludes
retirement accounts for agents before retirement, but includes them for agents above age 60.
In the model, we assume that retirement accounts take the form of a lump sum transfer at
retirement, which is calibrated to equal a fraction Ξ of labor income prior to retirement.
We initialize the model by giving age 25 agents housing, liquid assets and income to match
the distribution of age 23-27 households in the 2001 SCF. We then choose the parameters
α, β, Ψ, Ξ, φ and φ̂ to minimize the quadratic distance between housing, liquid wealth and
homeownership by age bin in the data and the corresponding values generated by the model.
We target liquid wealth rather than total non-housing wealth because this delivers MPCs which
are more in line with empirical estimates. This is consistent with the observation in Kaplan
and Violante (2014) that many households are “wealthy-hand-to-mouth”. While it would be
desirable to separately model liquid and illiquid wealth in addition to the choice of housing, this
would substantially complicate the analysis. The majority of non-housing illiquid wealth is held
in retirement accounts, which have large withdrawal penalties prior to retirement but become
fully liquid after retirement. Thus, we believe that our calibration strategy reasonably matches
the fraction of wealth that can be easily accessed both prior to and after retirement.28
Figure 1 shows the fit of the calibrated model in terms of average housing wealth (top
panel), average liquid wealth net of debt (middle panel), and homeownership (bottom panel),
by age bin.29 Blue circles are model predictions and red squares are 2001 SCF data. Despite its
simplicity the model delivers a reasonable fit, the main discrepancy being a homeownership rate
27

More specifically, following Kaplan and Violante (2014), we define liquid wealth net of debt in the data as
the sum of cash, money market, checking, savings, and call accounts as well as directly held mutual funds, stocks,
bonds and T-bills, net of credit card and mortgage debt and pick this to match net liquid assets in the model.
For retired households we also include retirement accounts in liquid assets. Note that we subtract mortgage debt
since households can borrow frictionlessly against housing in the model, so a household with the same financial
assets but less mortgage debt has more ability to smooth consumption. Housing wealth in the data is defined as
the gross value of primary residences, other residential real estate and nonresidential real estate, and is matched
to H in the model. In order to normalize the data and model, we divide liquid assets net of debt and housing
wealth by the overall average income of age 25-59 year old households.
28
Nevertheless, targeting total wealth rather than liquid wealth still produces large elasticities.

which is slightly too large near retirement and too much debt in the mid 30s and 40s. Overall,
with six parameters we are able to closely fit a total of twenty seven life-cycle moments.
Table 2 shows that our model also reasonably matches a variety of untargeted wealth and
housing statistics in the cross-section for both homeowners and renters from the SCF. In particular, we show that our model roughly reproduces the distribution of housing values for owners,
LTV ratios, liquid assets for both owners and renters and total net worth for both owners and
renters.30 The richest renters in the model are poorer than in reality, but this is because we
have no idiosyncratic preferences for renting vs. owning so all households in the model choose
to own once they become rich enough. However, since, as we show below, renters of all wealth
levels have zero consumption responses to house price movements, this modest discrepancy is
unimportant for our conclusions. Overall, we conclude that our model is a reasonable fit to the
wealth distribution and so we have some confidence in using the model to assess the quantitative
implications of house price shocks for consumption.

2.3

Consumption Elasticities

Our model is thus able to match a variety of facts in the cross-section as well as over the
life-cycle. What are its implications for consumption responses to house price shocks?
Overall, we find that consumption responses to house price shocks in this model are large.
For example, the model delivers an aggregate elasticity of 0.23 for working age households in
response to a two standard deviation increase in house prices.31 This number is in line with
30

In the model liquid assets and net worth are identical for renters since all non-housing assets are liquid, but
liquid assets and total net worth for renters in the data are also extremely similar.
31
We discuss how implications change with the size of house price shocks below. We focus on working age

Table 2: Untargeted Moments, Selected Characteristics of Wealth Distribution

Each sub-panel orders households by the labeled statistic and displays various percentiles. See footnote 27 for
the definitions of liquid assets and housing values. Liquid assets are net of debt (including mortgage debt for
homeowners). The LTV ratio is computed as the value of mortgage debt divided by housing values. Net worth is
the sum of liquid assets (net of all debt) plus housing values. For consistency with our other analysis, statistics
in this table are restricted to working age households ages 25-59. Following Kaplan et al. (2014) and Gorea and
Midrigan (2017), we trim the upper tail of the income distribution in the SCF. Kaplan et al. (2014) trim the
top 5% while Gorea and Midrigan (2017) trim the top 20%. We use an intermediate value of 10%, but results
are similar when using alternative thresholds.

empirical estimates summarized in the introduction and is large relative to elasticities delivered
by PIH models. For example, in Appendix A.1, we show that a similarly calibrated PIH model
delivers an elasticity of only 0.047.
There is also substantial household heterogeneity: the standard deviation of elasticities across
households is 0.25 and the interquartile range is 0.32. In the following sections we explore this
heterogeneity along many dimensions such as age, income, liquid wealth, house size and rental
status. However, we defer these results until after deriving our rule-of-thumb formula in the
next section, since we use this formula extensively in their interpretation.
Why are consumption elasticities in this model so large relative to PIH intuition that says
effects should be small? To understand both the large aggregate response as well as variation
in responses across households, we turn now to the derivation of our primary analytical result.
households for reasons discussed above, but if we include all households, we find a similar value of 0.2

Frictionless Adjustment: an Analytical Result

We now turn to a simplified version of the model and derive an analytical result that helps us
understand the consumption elasticities computed in the last section. In a version of the model
with frictionless housing adjustment, the individual consumption response to a permanent house
price shock is given by a simple formula: the marginal propensity to consume out of temporary
income shocks times the value of the housing stock. After deriving this result in the simplified
model, we return to the more realistic model with adjustment costs and show that, although
the formula no longer holds exactly, it gives a good approximation, so we can use it as a rule of
thumb for understanding consumption responses.
The only changes from our baseline model are that we make housing costless to transact
and we shut off the rental market. In particular, we set F = 0, so housing adjustment is
frictionless. We keep the assumption that house prices follow a geometric random walk with drift:
Pt = xt Pt−1 , where xt is an i.i.d. shock with arbitrary distribution and E[xt ] = eµ . Importantly,
we continue to assume CRRA preferences with unit elasticity of substitution between H and C.
To set the stage for our result, we represent the household problem recursively. Define total
wealth Wit ≡ (1 − δ)Pt Hit−1 + (1 + r)Ait−1 . The household’s Bellman equation is then
V (Wit , zit , jit , Pt ) =

We are now ready to prove our main analytical result.
Proposition 1 In the model with no adjustment costs, the individual response of non-durable
consumption to the permanent house price shock xt is

where M P Cit is the individual marginal propensity to consume out of transitory income shocks.

13

Proof. First, we prove by induction that the value function can be written as
V (W, z, j, P ) = P −(1−σ)(1−α) v (W, z, j) ,
for all (W, z, j, P ), where for j < J + 1 the function v satisfies the Bellman equation


v(W, z, j) = max U (C, H̃) + βE x−(1−σ)(1−α) v (W 0 , z 0 , j + 1) ,

subject to

C + H̃ + A = Y (s) + W,
W 0 = (1 − δ) xH̃ + (1 + r) A,
(1 − θ) (1 − δ) xH̃ + (1 + r) A ≥ 0,
z 0 = ρz + .

The property holds immediately for V (W, z, J +1, P ) since PXt = ΩPt1−α . Next, we prove that if
the property holds for V (W, z, j+1, P ) then it holds for V (W, z, j, P ). Rewrite the Bellman equation (2) in terms of the variable H̃t = Pt Ht . The property U (C, H̃/P ) = P −(1−σ)(1−α) U (C, H̃)
−(1−σ)(1−α)
and the induction hypothesis imply that Pt
can be factored out of the objective function without affecting the optimization problem. This completes the induction step.
Let C (W, z, j) denote the policy function associated with the last optimization problem and
notice that, by construction, it is independent of the current price P . We can then derive two
versions of the result. For infinitesimal house price shocks the consumption response is:
∂C (Wit , zit , jit )
× (1 − δ)Pt−1 Hit−1 ,
∂W
For a discrete house price shock ∆P/Pt−1 the response is:
C (Wit + ∆W, zit , jit ) − C (Wit , zit , jit )
× (1 − δ)Pt−1 Hit−1 ,
∆W
where ∆W = (1 − δ)Hit ∆P . In both expressions, the first term is equal to the MPC. In the
first case it is the local MPC. In the second case it is the MPC out of discrete (transitory)
income changes, which takes into account the non-linearity of the consumption function and its
interaction with the size of the income shock.
Consumption responses to house price changes can be measured in different ways. Expression
(3) gives the response in dollar terms to a percentage increase in house values and has the
advantage that it can be aggregated over individuals. On the other hand, the elasticity of
consumption to house prices ηit has the advantage of being unit free. We generally focus on

14

elasticities throughout the paper, which immediately follow from our previous result:
ηit = M P Cit ×

(1 − δ) Pt−1 Hit−1

Cit

The simple formula in Proposition 1 contains two endogenous objects, so it is not a closed
form solution. Its primary advantage is in providing insight into how endogenous forces shape
the sensitivity of an economy to house price shocks. In particular, house price shocks will have
bigger effects when MPCs are larger, when gross housing wealth is larger, and when there is a
stronger positive correlation between MPCs and housing values in the economy. The proposition
also tells us that any changes in the model’s parameters only affect consumption responses to
house price shocks through their effects on MPCs and housing values. In this sense, MPC × PH
is a sufficient statistic for the model-implied response of consumption to house price shocks.
While formula (3) may at first sight appear tautological, the non-obvious content arises
because we are considering the consumption response to a change in house prices which, in
general, has additional effects on top of changing the value of housing holdings. In particular,
when house prices increase, there are four effects: (1) the substitution effect that makes the
consumer substitute away from housing—which is now more expensive—towards other goods;
(2) the ordinary income effect, which makes the consumer poorer because the implicit rental cost
of housing is higher today and in all future dates; (3) the endowment income effect, which makes
households richer in proportion to their initial holdings of housing; (4) the collateral effect, which
implies that—for given housing choices—households can borrow more. The proposition shows
that effects (1), (2) and (4) cancel out, so we are left with the endowment income effect (3). In
Appendix A.2 we formally define these effects, extending the textbook definition of income and
substitution effects to the dynamic, incomplete market economy analyzed here. In Appendix
Figure A-1 we plot the four effects for a calibrated version of the model with frictionless housing
adjustment to illustrate that each effect is individually large but that three exactly cancel.
When the collateral constraint is not binding the intuition for the result comes straight from
Cobb-Douglas preferences under which the substitution effect and the (ordinary) income effect
cancel out. When the collateral constraint is binding the intuition for the result is more subtle
and has to do with the fact that when choosing the optimal ratio of housing to non-durable
consumption, consumers internalize the fact that housing has the extra marginal benefit of
relaxing the collateral constraint. When we include that benefit in the consumer’s marginal
calculations, it is the combined substitution and collateral effect which then cancel with the
income effect, again due to Cobb-Douglas preferences.
The absence of adjustment costs in housing is clearly also important for the result above.
Due to that assumption, one can think of a house price increase as leading to an immediate sale
of housing to convert the capital gain to liquid wealth, followed by spending the liquid wealth
15

on consumption and on housing services as dictated by the appropriate marginal propensities
to spend out of liquid wealth (with all other price effects muted because of Cobb-Douglas preferences). In the rest of the paper, we shall see that this assumption can be relaxed substantially
but the result remains approximately true. The reason is that even if households do not sell
their houses they still have room to respond by adjusting their liquid wealth position, e.g., by
running down liquid holdings or borrowing more.
Another important assumption behind the proposition is that we focus on permanent shocks
to house prices. If shocks are not permanent, then they also change the expected future path
of house appreciation or depreciation. Even with frictionless housing adjustment and CobbDouglas preferences, changes in expected appreciation or depreciation will generate additional
consumption effects by altering the user-cost-of-housing and so changing the choice of housing
vs. non durables. We explore these quantitative effects in Section 7.
Our result also holds in a PIH version of the model in which income uncertainty and borrowing constraints are eliminated (see Appendix A.1). The low consumption responses in the
PIH model can then be interpreted in the light of formula (3) and arise from the fact that no
income uncertainty and no borrowing constraints lead to low MPCs for all households.
Another way to interpret low responses in the PIH model is that the ordinary income effect
and the endowment income effect roughly cancel out for consumers with stable levels of housing,
reflecting the intuition mentioned in the introduction. The collateral effect is absent, as borrowing is unconstrained. This leaves only the substitution effect which tends to be small.32 In
contrast, in environments with income uncertainty and borrowing constraints, like our baseline
model, the endowment effect is larger than the ordinary income effect, because a permanent
increase in house prices leads to an immediate increase in financial resources while the increase
in implicit rental costs occurs mostly in the future. House price movements remain neutral
for a household’s lifetime budget constraint, but borrowing constraints mean that consumption
responds more to current than future income, so the endowment effect dominates.

4

Understanding Elasticities in the Baseline Model

While our simple formula only holds exactly with frictionless housing adjustment, we now show
that it remains highly informative in our baseline model with adjustment costs and rent and so
serves as a useful rule of thumb in this more general model. We begin by comparing the elasticity
predicted by the rule of thumb to the actual elasticity over the model’s entire state space. To
do this, for each combination of household states realized in the model, we compare the true
elasticity to the elasticity predicted by the rule of thumb. In order to reduce simulation error and
to produce a readable scatter plot, we pool households into 625 bins dividing the state space into
32

Sinai and Souleles (2005) eliminate substitution effects by fixing housing, leading to zero responses.

Elasticity Approximation

This figure shows how the actual elasticity and the approximate elasticity vary over the endogenous distribution
of states. Each point represents a bin of household states and plots the actual elasticity for that household state
against the elasticity implied by the rule-of-thumb formula. The R2 of a linear regression is 0.95.

quintiles by assets, housing, age, and income and then taking the average of the actual elasticity
and of the approximate elasticity in each bin.33 Figure 2 shows that the rule-of-thumb formula
is very accurate by displaying a scatter plot of the true elasticity against the approximation for
each point in the state-space. The R2 from a linear regression of the actual elasticity on the
approximation is 0.95, meaning that the approximation formula formally explains 95% of the
variance in actual elasticities across households.
In the rest of this section, we look at how elasticities vary across the state space and use
our approximation to interpret this variation. Figure 3 shows how elasticities (actual and
approximate) vary along one dimension of the state space at a time. For example, the upper left
sub-figure in each panel divides the sample into twenty ventiles by income and plots elasticities
in each bin.34 The upper right sub-figure divides the sample into twenty housing bins, the lower
right panel shows results for each age from 25-60 and the lower left panel shows results dividing
the sample into 20 bins by “voluntary equity”, which is a convenient transformation of assets
1−δ
P H. As discussed in A.4,
A. In particular, voluntary equity is defined as Q ≡ A + (1 − θ) 1+r
since the borrowing constraint changes with the value of P H, this is a more relevant summary
statistic of liquidity constraints than is A alone. Panel (a) shows this for all households while
Panel (b) restricts to homeowners.
33

The formula is very accurate also when we compute it for each household-year observation, without grouping
in bins. In that case, we get an R2 of 0.934.
34
Note that we condition only on one-state variable at a time, but since several of these states are endogenous,
they will also vary across bins. For example, older households also have more housing.

This figure shows how the true elasticity and the approximation vary with each dimension of the individual
state-space in our baseline model. Panel (a) shows these results for all households while Panel (b) shows results
only for homeowners. Separately for each state except age, we divide the total sample of household observations
into 20 equal sized bins. We then calculate the average elasticity as well as the average value of the rule-of-thumb
formula for each bin and plot these values against the index of the bin. We include only age 25-59 households in
these calculations. Results are similar when instead calculating the median elasticity or the aggregate elasticity
in each bin or when including households of all ages. Since age is already discretized, we compute results for
each household age from 25-59 rather than binning results by age.

Focusing first on panel (b), which restricts attention to homeowners, it is clear that elasticities
are declining with income, assets (measured as voluntary equity), housing and age. The patterns
in panel (a) are more complicated and exhibit non-monotonicity but can be readily understood
using our rule-of-thumb formula. In particular Figure 4 shows how the two components of our
rule-of-thumb formula, MPC and PH vary with different states.
This figure makes it clear that elasticities are non-monotonic in income because housing
values fall rapidly as income declines. More specifically, low income households are much more
likely to choose to rent rather than own, and our rule-of-thumb formula shows that renters
have zero response to house price movements.35 One might think that house price increases
would lower renters’ consumption since they induce negative income effects with no offsetting
endowment effect. However, this is not the case, since income and substitution effects exactly
cancel with Cobb-Douglas preferences: renters respond to house price increases by living in
smaller houses, not by reducing consumption. Since they also have no collateral effect, renters’
consumption does not respond to house prices. It is interesting to note that our model is thus
consistent with the empirical findings in Campbell and Cocco (2007) and Guiso et al. (2005)
that renters of all ages exhibit small responses of consumption to house price movements.
35

Here we define renters based on start-of-the-period status. Households who begin as owners and switch to
renting do have positive elasticities to house price shocks, but this is again understood through our formula since
these households have a positive value of housing endowment. Since we concentrate on age 25-59 households,
very few switch from owning to renting and so these households are unimportant quantitatively.

Age

This figure shows how the MPCs and housing values vary with each dimension of the individual state-space
in our baseline model. These results are computed including all households (both renters and owners) of ages
25-59. The construction parallels that in Figure 3, so see those figure notes for additional details.

The steep elasticity decline in the first few voluntary equity bins in Figure 3 can be understood similarly: the first few bins contain highly levered homeowners with large MPCs and
elasticities while the next bins contain renters with zero elasticities, who have little liquid wealth
but also no debt. Similarly, the relatively flat age profile of elasticities reflects the fact that
MPCs decline substantially with age, while homeownership rates and housing values increase
substantially with age, and that these effects roughly offset each other.
All of the results thus far are computed in response to a two standard deviation increase
in house prices. Figure 5 shows how the aggregate elasticity of consumption to house prices
and the accuracy of the approximation varies with the size of house price shocks. Clearly, the
true elasticity declines with the size of house price shocks. This occurs because the presence
of borrowing constraints induces non-linearities in MPCs. Positive shocks relax borrowing constraints and reduce the MPC while negative shocks instead tighten borrowing constraints and
increase the MPC. However, as long as we calculate the MPC using the correct shock size, then
the rule of thumb remains accurate.36 The fact that MPCs are non-linear in models with borrowing constraints does not affect our rule of thumb, it just means that consumption responses
to wealth shocks will depend on the size and sign of the shocks. However, these non-linearities
are relatively small for typical house price shocks. The standard deviation of house price shocks
is 4.59% in FHFA data so the elasticity of consumption on impact is between 0.23 and 0.3 for
most house price shocks. Thus, our model delivers asymmetries to house price increases and

decreases, but these are much smaller than those in Guerrieri and Iacoviello (2014)’s representative agent model because whether or not borrowing constraints bind in our model is largely
determined by idiosyncratic shocks rather than aggregate house price movements. House price
shocks do move some households in and out of borrowing constraints in our environment, but
unless these shocks are extremely large, these effects are fairly modest.
How are elasticities and the accuracy of approximations affected by other model features
and non-linearities? Figure 6 shows the effect of first eliminating the rental option and then
eliminating fixed costs of housing adjustment. We recalibrate these models following the same
strategy discussed in Section 2.2 with the exception of no longer targeting homeownership rates.
The fit and parameters are shown in Appendix A.3. After recalibrating the models, we again
compute the true elasticity on impact to a two-standard deviation house price increase.
Solid lines in Figure 6 show the true elasticity in the model as a function of age and dashed
lines of the same color show the approximation from our rule of thumb.37 The rental option has
little effect on the accuracy of our rule-of-thumb formula, but has large effects on elasticities:
eliminating the option to rent raises the aggregate elasticity from 0.23 to 0.39. Our MPC × PH
formula helps to provide intuition for why the elasticity is so much lower in our baseline model
with renters than in a model with no rental option. First, since renters do not own a house, their
consumption does not respond to house price movements. Hence, if we match the homeownership
37

Note that we do not plot an approximation line for the model with no fixed costs, since the rule-of-thumb
formula holds exactly. For expositional purposes we show only results by age, but conclusions are similar when
cutting along other dimensions of the state-space.

rate in our data set of roughly 70%, the average elasticity of consumption to house prices
will mechanically fall, even if all households are otherwise identical. However, this mechanical
effect cannot explain the entire increase from 0.23 to 0.39. The rest of the difference occurs
because households are not identical and home ownership is not randomly distributed in the
population. Households with high MPCs tend to choose to rent, given that they are closer to
being constrained and thus prefer liquid wealth over illiquid housing. This selection effect into
renting explains the remainder of the elasticity differences between the two models.
In contrast to the rental option, eliminating the fixed cost of housing adjustment has almost
no effect on consumption responses to house price movements. Elasticities are slightly lower
early in life and slightly higher later in life, but the overall aggregate elasticity is identical at 0.39
in the model with and without fixed costs. Thus, we conclude that modeling rent is important
for getting consumption responses to house price shocks correct. In contrast, fixed costs matter
for matching the empirical frequency of housing adjustment and homeownership rates but have
little direct effect on consumption responses to house prices. As we show now this is explained
in part by the fact that households can borrow against their housing equity, which increases the
liquidity of housing wealth even in the presence of transaction costs on buying and selling.

Robustness and Extensions
Long-Term Debt

So far we have modeled borrowing as one-period loans subject to a collateral constraint. We now
introduce long-term debt into the model in order to assess its effects on consumption elasticities
and the accuracy of our rule-of-thumb formula. This is important for several reasons. First,
we want to assess the extent to which realistic frictions on home-equity extraction affect our
conclusions. With frictionless one-period debt, households can adjust their borrowing costlessly
every period, while in reality there are costs to home-equity extraction which make housing
wealth illiquid. Second, and more importantly, Ganong and Noel (2016) present empirical
evidence that underwater borrowers respond little to mortgage debt relief which does not affect
households’ current budget constraints. The implication is that house price shocks may not be
equivalent to cash payments when households are underwater or cannot easily refinance. Our
baseline model with one-period debt cannot capture these effects since households must satisfy
the collateral constraint period by period.
While we do not attempt to model all the details of fixed-rate mortgages and home-equity
loans, we introduce three important elements of U.S. mortgages: 1) equity extraction costs, 2)
collateral constraints which only bind at origination and 3) amortization.38
We model equity extraction costs by making the following assumption: if a household chooses
positive holdings of the risk-free asset At or chooses any At ≥ At−1 it can do so at no cost; but if
the household chooses a negative At smaller than At−1 —i.e., if it increases its debt level—it must
pay a fixed cost F ref i proportional to the current value of the house.39 We pick this refinancing
cost to match the frequency of refinancing observed in Bhutta and Keys (2014), which implies
a fixed cost of 0.012. In our baseline model, roughly 30% of households increase debt each year
while with the refinancing cost, this number falls to a realistic 10%.40 Thus, refinancing costs
substantially reduce the number of households who extract equity.
U.S. mortgages are also long-term amortizing loans with collateral constraints that only
bind at the time of origination: when house prices rise and households gain equity, households
have the option to extract this equity and borrow more. In contrast, when house prices fall,
lenders cannot force households to put up additional collateral. That is, households are not
forced to repay their mortgage faster, even if their loan-to-value ratios go above the maximum
allowed for new loans. Since interest rates are constant in our model, long-term mortgages with
amortization can be introduced with a simple change to the collateral constraint for households
38

Note that since interest rates are fixed in our model, long-term mortgages in our environment are equivalent
to the fixed rate mortgages prevalent in U.S. borrowing.

Versions of the model with fixed numeraire costs instead of costs proportional to the house value produce
extremely similar results.

Our model has no distinction between forms of equity extraction, so we match total shares.

where χ is the required minimum amortization rate on mortgages, which, following Gorea and
Midrigan (2017) we set equal to 0.969 to match the half-life of a 30-year mortgage. Intuitively,
when not refinancing, households with negative Ait must pay down their debt at at least rate χ
but can also prepay costlessly. Households with positive Ait can save or dis-save costlessly but
must pay the fixed cost of refinancing a mortgage in order to move to negative Ait .
In our baseline model, assets and debt are both fully liquid so that, as usual, only net
positions are well-defined. Introducing long-term debt and liquid assets typically means that
gross-positions become relevant, which substantially complicates the computational problem
by introducing a second endogenous state-variable. Fully introducing this more complicated
asset structure would substantially increase the computational burden and thus require eliminating other features of the model which we think are essential for our analysis.41 We instead
substantially simplify by assuming that households always exhaust liquid assets before taking
on any mortgage debt. This allows us to introduce long-term debt without adding any new
state-variables, but it means that no households with mortgage debt in the model have any
liquid assets. As shown in the bottom panel of Table A-4, this is a reasonable description of
homeowners in the bottom half of the liquid wealth distribution, but it is clearly counterfactual
for homeowners between the 50th and 85th percentile of the liquid wealth distribution. This is
why we do not use this setup in our baseline model, but we nevertheless think it is quite useful
for getting some sense of how long-term debt changes elasticities and the accuracy of our ruleof-thumb formula. If anything, it is likely to overstate the extent to which the rule-of-thumb
41

Many models introduce complicated asset structures of this form but then simplify in some important
dimensions relative to our model. For example, Ganong and Noel (2016) and Gorea and Midrigan (2017) have
no house price shocks, which are the heart of our paper, and the former does not model housing choices. Beraja
et al. (2017) assume an exogenous fixed housing size as do Campbell and Cocco (2015) except when defaulting.
Greenwald (2016) works with a representative borrower model and so abstracts from heterogeneity in income
shocks, MPCs and housing values. Kaplan et al. (2016) work with a general equilibrium model with richer
mortgages than our own but then limit houses to one of six sizes for computational tractability, which limits the
strength of substitution effects. Wong (2016) also features an extremely rich quantitative environment but does
not allow for separate refinancing and moving decisions and computational tractability requires working with a
2-state income process and small number of house price values, limiting the MPC heterogeneity which we show
is important for house price effects on consumption.

23

formula fails for high leverage households, because these households will have higher MPCs to
income shocks in the model than in reality since they hold no liquid assets in the model. For the
same reason, highly levered households in the model have no way to respond to house prices.
Aside from the refinancing cost discussed above, we recalibrate this model following exactly
the same strategy as in Section 2.2. The fit is shown in Appendix Figure A-7, parameters in
Table A-3 and additional untargeted moments in Table A-4. Figure 7 shows the accuracy of
the rule-of-thumb formula in this model with long-term debt with costly refinancing. Overall,
the formula is mildly less accurate, with the R2 falling from 0.95 to 0.90, but this means it still
explain 90% of the variation in true elasticities over the state-space in the model.

Elasticity Approximation

This figure shows how the true elasticity and the approximation vary over the entire endogenous joint-distribution
of the state-space in a model with long-term debt. Each point represents a particular combination of all the
endogenous household states and shows the true elasticity for that household state compared to that implied by
the rule-of-thumb formula. The R2 for a simple linear regression is 0.90.

Why does frictional long-term debt affect the accuracy of the rule-of-thumb formula and
where is the formula least accurate? This can be seen most clearly in Figure 8, which plots
the true elasticity and approximation as a function of leverage for the baseline model with
frictionless one-period debt as well as the model with long-term debt and refinancing costs. The
accuracy of the formula is somewhat reduced for lower leverage households since the presence
of refinancing costs mean that households do not respond to house price shocks exactly as
predicted by their pure endowment effects. However, the quantitatively important breakdown
of the formula clearly occurs for households with leverage greater than the maximum allowed
1−δ
at origination (1 − θ) 1+r
, which is shown as the vertical dashed line in the figure. This occurs
exactly because households that are far from the required downpayment for refinancing are

24

unable to borrow and increase consumption in response to house price increases.42 However,
these highly leveraged households have no liquid assets in our model and so have high MPCs
and thus large predicted elasticities under the rule of thumb. Thus, the presence of long-term
debt and the ability for borrowers to remain underwater breaks the equivalence between house
price shocks and liquid income shocks. This same point holds in the model of Ganong and Noel
(2016) and is used to explain their empirical finding that the consumption of highly leveraged
households does not respond to mortgage debt forgiveness. Their model does not include house
price shocks but features a richer asset structure together with strategic default, so the fact that
we reach essentially identical conclusions is reassuring.

Leverage

This figure shows how the true elasticity (solid line) and the approximation (dashed line) vary with leverage for
our baseline model (top panel) and for our extended model with long-term debt (bottom panel). The maximum
LTV at origination is shown as the vertical dashed line.

Although our rule-of-thumb formula clearly breaks down for households who are unable to
refinance, the previous Figure 7 shows that this has little effect on the overall accuracy of the
formula. This is because in our baseline calibration matched to the long-run behavior of the
U.S. economy, there are very few households with leverage in this region. Our baseline model
features stochastic house price shocks, but the presence of mortgage amortization plus modest
trend growth in house prices pushes households away from this region. It is also worth noting
that in the high leverage region where the rule-of-thumb formula fails, the true elasticity rapidly
declines towards zero. This means that even though the rule-of-thumb no longer works in this
region, we do not really need this formula in order to predict elasticities: once households
become underwater, the true elasticity rapidly declines to zero. Of course, during periods of
42

Conversely, they are not required to put up additional collateral and reduce consumption when prices fall.

25

time such as the Great Recession when more households are underwater, the accuracy of the
rule-of- thumb will decline. However, even during this extreme event, our rule-of-thumb formula
would still apply for the typical homeowner since most homeowners were not underwater.43
In addition to our finding that long-term frictional debt has only a modest effect on the
accuracy of our rule of thumb, it is also worth noting that its presence only reduces the true
aggregate elasticity from 0.23 to 0.20. The introduction of refinancing costs and allowing households to remain underwater both reduce the true elasticity of consumption to house prices, but
like housing transaction costs, these effects are not quantitatively large. Since there are few
households in the very high leverage region, the presence of long-term debt and underwater
borrowers has little effect on aggregates. Refinancing costs are relevant over the whole leverage
distribution, but the decisions of households with the highest MPCs who contribute most to the
aggregate elasticity are relatively unaffected by a moderate cost of refinancing.44

5.2

House Price Volatility

Our baseline model is calibrated to match the annual standard deviation of aggregate house
prices in FHFA data of 4.59% since house prices in our model are aggregate. Instead calibrating
house price shocks to match the larger standard deviation of house prices of 8% observed at very
disaggregated census tracts has a negligible effect in our baseline model, lowering the aggregate
elasticity from 0.23 to 0.22 and leaving the R2 from a regression of the true elasticity on the ruleof-thumb approximation unchanged at 0.95. Appendix Figures A-2 and A-3 show the effects of
increasing the volatility of house prices in the model with long-term debt. The R2 falls from
0.90 to 0.87 as more volatile house price shocks push more households underwater, but clearly
we can still explain the vast majority of true elasticity variation using our formula. Results in
a version of the model without stochastic house prices are also similar.

5.3

Preferences and Price-Rent Ratio

Our baseline model features Cobb-Douglas preferences and the derivation of our rule-of-thumb
in the version of the model with no adjustment costs relies crucially on that assumption. As
discussed in the model setup, there are a range of estimates for the elasticity of substitution
between housing and non-housing consumption, but the bulk of micro-oriented studies tend to
43

Fuster et al. (2016) show that outside of the housing crisis, very few homeowners are underwater. In 2009,
just over 20% of mortgage holders are underwater. Since roughly 1/3 of homeowners own outright, this means
that the peak fraction of homeowners underwater in the crisis was around 15%.
44
This is due to extensive margin effects arising from fixed adjustment costs. These costs reduce cash-out
activity substantially, but this reduction is concentrated amongst households who would have only extracted
small amounts of equity with small resulting effects on consumption. Households who need to extract substantial
housing equity in order to increase consumption will still do so even in the presence of adjustment costs.

26

support the Cobb-Douglas specification. The use of Cobb-Douglas preferences also substantially simplifies computations in our model with random walk house price shocks, as shown in
Appendix A.4, since it allows us to eliminate the current house price as a state-variable. Nevertheless, since there is some disagreement over this elasticity of substitution, it is important to
explore the robustness of our results to this elasticity of substitution. We do so by extending
our utility function to a CES specification:
(1−σ)
−1
−1  −1
1 


U (Cit , Hit ) =
αCit + (1 − α) Hit
1−σ

where  is the intra-temporal elasticity of substitution between non-durable consumption and
housing services. We then compute results for two cases which bound typical empirical estimates,
 = 0.8 and  = 1.25.45 Raising the elasticity of substitution from 1 to 1.25 raises the aggregate
elasticity from 0.23 to 0.28 and lowers the R2 from the approximation formula from 0.95 to
0.91. Lowering the elasticity of substitution to 0.8 reduces the aggregate elasticity from 0.23
to 0.19 and actually raises the R2 from 0.95 to 0.97. Thus, reasonable changes in the elasticity
of substitution do not affect our broad conclusion that the response of consumption to house
prices is large and that our rule-of-thumb is useful for predicting this response.46
Our baseline model also assumes a constant price-rent ratio Rt = φPt . Like the CobbDouglas preferences, this assumption is necessary to eliminate house prices as a state-variable
and so substantially simplifies computations, but it is again important to assess the robustness
of our results on this dimension. If we make the opposite extreme assumption that Rt is fixed
while Pt varies, then the aggregate elasticity rises to 0.27 and the R2 remains high at 0.92; so if
anything our baseline model likely understates consumption responses to house prices.

Taking the Rule of Thumb to the Data

The previous sections show that a simple rule-of-thumb formula provides a good approximation
to the consumption response on impact to a permanent house price shock in a wide class of
life-cycle models with uninsurable idiosyncratic income risk and borrowing constraints. We
view this largely as a theoretical result that is useful for understanding the large elasticities
delivered by these models. However, the rule-of-thumb formula can be measured in the data
given information on MPCs by housing values. Doing so provides both an important overidentification test of our quantitative model as well as an alternative empirical measure of
45

For computational simplicity, we also set µ = 0 in these results, but this has little effect in the baseline
model when recalibrated to hit the same moments.
46
Since this model is substantially more computationally burdensome, we first recalibrate parameters with
µ = 0 using our baseline model but then do not recalibrate the model as we change , which leads to slightly
different life-cycle moments and may in turn explain some of the changes.

27

housing wealth effects that relies only on the broad structure of this class of models. In this
section we measure our rule of thumb in micro data and show that its value is consistent with
both our model and with empirical estimates of housing wealth effects measured under different
identification assumptions.

6.1

BPP Approach

Estimating our rule of thumb requires data on both MPCs out of transitory income shocks and
on home values. While home values are easily obtained, estimating MPCs is more difficult. To
estimate MPCs we follow the identification approach of Blundell et al. (2008) (henceforth BPP).
BPP show that if income follows a process with a permanent and an i.i.d. component, then,
given individual level panel data on income and consumption, one can identify the MPC out
of transitory shocks. In particular, assume that log income is yit = zit + εit , where zit follows
a random walk with innovation ηit and εit is an i.i.d. shock. It follows that the change in log
income is equal to ∆yit = ηit + ∆εit .47 Given this income process, the elasticity of consumption
to transitory shocks is equal to
Et =

cov(∆cit ,εit )
.
var(εit )

Under the assumption that households have no advanced information about future shocks, a
consistent estimator of this elasticity is
ct =
E

cov(∆cit ,∆yit+1 )
.
cov(∆yit ,∆yit+1 )

With panel data containing at least three time periods, one can implement this estimator with
an instrumental variable regression of the change in consumption ∆cit on the change in income
∆yit , instrumenting for the current change in income with the future change in income, ∆yit+1 .
We then convert this elasticity to the MPC in levels relevant for our theory by multiplying by
C/Y . Since this requires individual level panel data on income and consumption, we use data
from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID).48
Kaplan and Violante (2010) show that BPP is highly robust at recovering the true MPC to
temporary shocks in a variety of models. However, they do not explore models with housing,
so one might wonder whether BPP recovers the true MPC to temporary income shocks in our
environment. We have performed exercises similar to Kaplan and Violante (2010) in our model
47

Abowd and Card (1989) show that this parsimonious specification fits income data well.
An alternative approach to estimate MPCs, used by Johnson et al. (2006), uses random government rebate
timing and CEX data. Unfortunately, it is well known that the resulting standard errors on MPCS are large since
CEX data has smaller sample sizes than PSID, no panel structure to disentangle true changes in consumption
from measurement error, and covers a smaller fraction of consumption. Large standard errors are especially
problematic for us, since we need to estimate MPCs conditional on different levels of housing wealth.
48

28

and indeed found that this procedure continues to work well even in the presence of housing
with transaction costs and rental markets.49

6.2

PSID Data

Implementing our sufficient statistic empirically requires a longitudinal data set with information
on income, consumption, and housing values at the household level. Starting from the 1999 wave,
the PSID contains the necessary data. The PSID started collecting information on a sample
of roughly 5,000 households in 1968. Thereafter, both the original families and their split-offs
(children of the original family forming a family of their own) have been followed. The survey
was annual until 1996 and became biennial starting in 1997. In 1999 the survey augmented the
consumption information available to researchers so that it now covers over 70 percent of all
consumption items available in the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX). This is why we use
1999 as the first year of our sample.
Since we use almost the same underlying sample as Kaplan et al. (2014), our description
of the PSID mirrors theirs. We start with the PSID Core Sample and drop households with
missing information on race, education, or state of residence, and those whose income grows
more than 500 percent, falls by more than 80 percent, or is below $100. We drop households
who have top-coded income or consumption. We drop households not in the sample at least
three consecutive times, because identification of the coefficients of interest requires at least
three periods. In our baseline calculations, we keep households whose head is 25-60 years old.
Our final sample has 30,462 observations over the years 1999-2011 (seven sample years).
We use the same consumption definition as Blundell et al. (2014) including food at and
away from home, utilities, gasoline, car maintenance, public transportation, childcare, health
expenditures and education. This data covers approximately 70% of consumption in the CEX.
We define income as the sum of labor income and government transfers. We purge the data
of non-model features by regressing ln cit and ln yit on year and cohort dummies, education,
race, family structure, employment, geographic variables, and interactions of year dummies
with education, race, employment, and region.

6.3

Results

In order to compute the elasticity implied by our rule-of-thumb formula, we must first calculate
MPCs by housing. To implement this in practice, we break the sample into 6 bins by housing,
pool all households in each bin and run the BPP procedure separately for each bin. We then
convert to MPCs by multiplying by the median value of C/Y in each bin. The first bin includes
49

Our baseline income process is also different, but we can verify that the BPP procedure recovers the correct
MPC to transitory shocks if they are added to the model, and other results are unchanged.

Age

This figure shows how the rule-of-thumb formula varies with income, home values, liquid wealth and age in the
PSID. For all plots except those by home value, we partition the data into 5 equal sized bins and run the BPP
procedure within each bin. For home values, all renters are assigned to bin “0” and homeowners are partitioned
into 5 equal bins. As in Figure 3 the horizontal axis in each panel shows the value of the bin index, except for
the age panel which shows the actual value

only renters—that is, households who own zero housing. The other five bins are quintiles
of the home value distribution and so are of equal size by construction. In total, we have
approximately 11,000 renters and 19,000 home owners. After computing how MPCs vary with
housing, we aggregate these results across bins to compute the implied aggregate elasticity using
our rule-of-thumb formula. Following this procedure, we arrive at an aggregate elasticity of 0.33
with a 95% confidence interval of (0.15,0.52). Although standard errors are obviously large, this
is reasonably close to the 0.23 value implied by our baseline model and is in line with empirical
estimates using completely identification strategies such as those in Mian et al. (2013).
Figure 9 computes how elasticities vary by different observable dimensions in the PSID.50
Although standard errors are again large, comparing this to Figure 3 shows that the model and
PSID estimates broadly line up with each other. The most prominent point of departure is
the elasticity as a function of housing. In the model, elasticities for homeowners decline with
housing while they are essentially flat or even mildly increasing with housing in the data. Since
our model reproduces the distribution of housing in the data, this difference is driven by an
MPC in the data that declines less with housing than in the model. This also explains the fact
that the point estimate for the aggregate elasticity in PSID data is moderately larger than our
model estimate. The fact that average MPCs decline relatively slowly with wealth in the data
50

Voluntary equity is more difficult to compute in the PSID than in the model since households in reality face
heterogeneous borrowing constraints. We assume that households face the same downpayment requirement as
in the model and measure voluntary equity as net-liquid assets +0.8PH−mortgage debt.

30

has been widely recognized and is a central theme of recent work on wealthy-hand-to-mouth
households pioneered by Kaplan and Violante (2014). While it would substantially complicate
the analysis, introducing a more complicated asset structure of this form could likely generate
more households with substantial housing wealth but large MPCs and so help further improve
the fit of our model. It might also help to better match the age profile of elasticities in the
model and the data. In the model, elasticities decline with age as households accumulate assets
over the life-cycle, while they have a mild hump shape in the data.

7

Dynamics

Our results up to now focus on impact effects of house prices on consumption, in a stationary environment. In this section, we explore dynamic results to highlight three important implications:
1) The consumption responses on impact that are the focus of our analysis are useful summary
statistics for the full impulse response function to shocks. 2) The response of consumption to
a given house price shock depends on previous shocks which have hit the economy, since they
change the distribution of leverage and MPCs across time. 3) Less-than-permanent shocks to
house prices lead to larger consumption responses on impact, but the total cumulative effect
over time is somewhat reduced as effects wear off more rapidly. However, effects are similar to
the permanent shocks in the rest of the paper for plausible persistence values.
We begin by moving from impact effects to full impulse-response functions. In particular,
we explore a number of comparative statics exercises in the model, changing parameter values
of interest and plotting the effects on the full impulse response function. Figure 10 shows the
impulse response to the same two standard deviation positive house price shock in economies
with different down-payment requirements θ.51 The first thing to note is that impulse responses
revert to zero. That is a permanent house price shock causes a temporary increase in nonhousing consumption. To get intuition for this result, note that in a model with precautionary
savings, agents tend to revert to some (stochastic) wealth path after a one-time capital gain.52
The next thing to note is that the impulse response functions for different parametrizations do
not cross each other, so a larger consumption response on impact predicts a larger effect at
future dates and, by implication, a larger cumulative impulse response.
Consumption responses to house price shocks are larger in economies with a lower downpayment requirement θ. Since we do not recalibrate the model as we change θ, one can interpret
this as showing that a structural increase in credit supply increases consumption sensitivity to
house price shocks in steady state. For example, moving from our baseline downpayment of 20%
51
Similar to other figures throughout the paper, we include only working-age households in our consumption
measure when computing responses.
52
Household death is a second force which drives transitory effects.

to a lower downpayment requirement of 15% increases the elasticity of consumption to house
price shocks on impact by 24% and increases the discounted cumulative impulse response by
18%.53 Thus, our model implies that as downpayment requirements in the U.S. have broadly
trended downwards over several decades, consumption has likely become more sensitive to house
price shocks. Since our rule of thumb works well in each of these economies, we can understand
these effects in a straightforward way through this formula: as θ declines, households purchase
larger houses using more leverage, which increases both MPC and PH.
Figure A-4 in the Appendix shows that these same conclusions hold in the model with longterm debt, although they are mildly attenuated. This attenuation arises because highly levered
households are more likely to receive shocks which push them underwater and thus into the
region where consumption elasticities are reduced substantially. However, these effects are not
strong enough to undo the amplification for households who are not underwater.
Figure 11 performs a similar comparative statics exercise, but now varying the trend growth
rate of house prices µ instead of θ. Again, impulse responses on impact are a useful summary of
consumption responses at future dates since impulse response functions never cross. Increasing
house price growth in the model has an even more powerful effect in the model than lowering
downpayments. This is because higher house price growth substantially lowers the effective user
cost of housing, leading to even larger increases in housing and leverage. This suggests that
consumption may be particularly sensitive to house price shocks during house price booms.
However, it is important to note that this comparative statics exercise compares consumption

We discount future consumption in this calculation using the household discount factor β.

elasticities in the steady-states of economies with permanently different house price growth. This
likely overstates the effects of increases in house price growth over shorter horizons, as households
take time to shift towards larger housing and additional leverage as house price growth increases.
To get some sense of the effects of increasing house price growth over shorter horizons more
relevant for typical house price booms, we thus turn to transitional dynamics. In particular, we
begin from the steady-state of our baseline economy with annual 1.2% house price growth and
then permanently increase house price growth unexpectedly to 4.8%, corresponding to average
house price growth in FHFA data over the U.S. housing boom from 2000-2006. For each year in
the transition path, we then compute the elasticity of consumption on impact to a two standard
deviation house price increase. Figure 12 displays results under two different assumptions for
household’s expectations of future house price growth. The line in blue shows results when
households have rational expectations and realize house price growth has permanently increased
from 1.2% to 4.8% while the dashed red line shows results when households do not realize house
price growth has increased and so instead continue to expect average house price growth of
1.2%. With unchanged expectations, households interpret the sequence of above average house
price growth as a lucky sequence of shocks rather than a new state of the world.
Since the economy is in the old steady-state in year 0 and has reached the new steady-state
by year 35, the 0.23 value of the blue line at year 0 corresponds to the aggregate elasticity in
our baseline economy while the 0.57 value of the blue line at year 35 corresponds to the first
element of the impulse response for the µ = 0.048 economy in Figure 11. Figure 12 illustrates
several important points. First, if households expect that house price growth has permanently

This figure shows transitional dynamics in response to a permanent increase in house price growth from 1.2% to
4.8% when households rationally update expectations (solid line) and when they incorrectly continue to expect
the old house price growth of 1.2% (dashed line). House price growth permanently increases in year 1 and the
economy reaches the new steady-state in year 35. The vertical axis shows the elasticity on impact to a permanent
two standard deviation positive house price shock occurring in a given year in the transition path.

increased, then housing booms of 6-7 years can lead to non-trivial increases in consumption
responses to house price shocks. By year 5, the elasticity on impact has increased from 0.23
to a little above 0.3. Second, full transitional dynamics are relatively slow: after 18 years, the
sensitivity of the economy to house price shocks has only moved half of the way to its new
steady-state. This implies that steady-state comparative statics exercises like those in Figure
11 are likely to overstate the effects of shorter-lived housing booms. Third, expectations matter
substantially. Greater house price growth still leads consumption elasticities to rise mildly even
if households do not change their expectations, but the effects are very attenuated.
This can be understood by again using our rule-of-thumb formula and looking at housing
values and debt over the transition path in Figure 13 under the two assumptions about expectations. In both cases, higher actual house price growth leads to higher housing values, PH.
However, if households realize that house price growth has increased, then they also purchase
larger houses H since housing has effectively become cheaper, further increasing PH. They do
so by taking out substantially more debt, as shown in the bottom panel. This greater debt
increases the MPC in the economy and together with the larger value of PH, substantially
increases consumption elasticities as shown with our rule-of-thumb formula.
Our final exercise explores the robustness of our conclusions to reducing the persistence of
house price shocks. In particular, we assume that instead of following a random walk, house
prices follow an AR-process with persistence ρ.54 Figure 14 shows the impulse response to the

This figure shows transitional dynamics of housing values and debt in response to a permanent increase in
house price growth from 1.2% to 4.8% when households rationally update expectations (solid line) and when
they incorrectly continue to expect the old house price growth of 1.2% (dashed line). House price growth
permanently increases in year 1 and the economy reaches the new steady-state in year 35.

same two standard deviation positive house price shock as we reduce ρ. Reducing ρ from 1 to
0.99 has essentially no effect on results, so it is not particularly important for quantitative results
whether shocks are perfectly persistent or only nearly so. As ρ is reduced further, consumption
responses on impact increase relative to the case with permanent shocks. This is because our
experiment is a price shock, not a wealth shock: when prices mean revert, households can
respond to a positive house price shock by selling housing today and repurchasing it in the
future when houses decline, at an expected profit. This makes consumption on impact more
responsive to transitory than permanent price changes.55
Of course, the the shock itself also wears off more quickly as ρ declines, as is also apparent
in Figure 14. This means that even though consumption effects are stronger on impact, they
also die off more quickly. On net, lowering ρ from 1 to 0.95 increases the IRF on impact by 20%
and reduces the cumulative impulse response by 7%. Whether one cares more about the impact
effect or the cumulative effect will depend on whether one is more interesting in short-term or
longer run consumption effects, but either way, our model continues to imply large consumption
responses to house price shocks.56
an additional state-variable and complicates model solutions. Eliminating house price growth partially simplifies
the analysis, so we assume that µ = 0 and recalibrate our baseline model with ρ = 1 to match the same moments.
We do not recalibrate the models as we reduce ρ below 1.
55
This is similar to intuition in King and Rebelo (1999) that intertemporal substitution falls as shock persistence grows.
56
The empirical value of ρ varies somewhat across data series as well as the associated time-series covered

Conclusion

In this paper, we explore the implications of consumption theory for understanding housing
price effects on consumption. While a large and growing empirical literature documents strong
responses of consumption to identified house price movements, a large theoretical literature
argues that this response should be small.
We show that a calibrated workhorse incomplete markets model that includes income uncertainty, rental markets, collateralized borrowing and fixed costs of adjusting housing produces
large aggregate consumption responses to house price changes, in line with the recent empirical
literature and significantly larger than in the standard PIH model. To provide intuition for this
result, we derive a new rule of thumb for the individual response of consumption on impact to
an unexpected, permanent house price change that contains significant explanatory power even
in complicated model environments. In particular, we show that the individual consumption
response is equal to the MPC out of transitory income times the individual value of housing.
This means the aggregate elasticity is determined by the endogenous joint distribution of MPCs
and housing. Using our rule of thumb we see that the reason our baseline model generates large
elasticities is that borrowing constraints and the presence of leverage mean that MPCs are large
and highly correlated with housing values. In contrast, PIH models generate small elasticities
but estimates at the high-end are around 1 and estimates at the low-end are around 0.9. The rule-of-thumb
formula will progressively lose accuracy for predicting consumption responses on impact as ρ decreases but this
increasing bias will progressively push towards understating true responses.

36

because they produce small MPCs that are uncorrelated with housing.
Our results also imply that the size of housing price effects varies substantially across households. Indeed, we find large variation in elasticities depending on age, leverage, homeownership
status and wealth. We also find that responses can change in response to changes in credit
supply or in response to house price booms. The quantitative strength of house price booms on
the sensitivity of consumption depends crucially on both their length and on households’ expectations of future house price growth. The presence of this time-variation and heterogeneity
may help reconcile various empirical results and should be accounted for when predicting the
aggregate consequences of housing market policies.

A.1

The Permanent-Income Case

We describe here a special case of our model that can be solved analytically and gives us a reference permanent-income-hypothesis (PIH) result, with small house price effects on consumption.
Consider the case of a deterministic income process (σε = 0), no borrowing constraints,
and constant house prices Pt = P . Assume (1 + r)β = 1 and Ψ = (1 − β)−σ . Under these
assumptions, there is perfect consumption smoothing: non-durable consumption and housing
are constant over the lifetime. Moreover, non-durable consumption is equal to a fixed fraction
α(1 − β) of total wealth, which includes human wealth, housing wealth, and financial wealth:57
Cit = α(1 − β)

(1 + r)−τ Yit+τ + (1 − δ) P Hit−1 + (1 + r) Ait−1 .

τ =t

Now consider the effect of an unexpected, permanent shock to the house price P . The
elasticity of consumption to this shock is equal to the share of housing in total wealth:

(A1)

What are the quantitative implications of this case? To assess this, note that equation (A1)
also holds in the aggregate, so each quantity on the right-hand side can be measured directly
using aggregate data. For consistency with the rest of the paper we use aggregates from the
2001 Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) and focus on households ages 25-59. We then get
(1 − δ)P H = 2.04Y and A = −.47Y , where P H is the average value of housing, A is average
liquid wealth net of debt, Y is average earnings and we set δ = 0.022 as in our baseline model.
Using an interest rate of r = 2.4% and an infinite horizon approximation, human wealth is equal
to Y /r = 41.66Y . The aggregate elasticity of non-durable consumption implied by the model
is then 0.047, a small number relative to empirical housing price effects. It is also insensitive
to the level of household debt. For example, a large increase in household debt of 0.5Y so that
A = −0.97Y yields a nearly identical and still small elasticity of 0.048.
What drives the consumption response to house prices in the PIH model? The response can
be decomposed into three effects: a substitution effect, an income effect, and an endowment
effect.58 It is then possible to interpret equation (A1) in two ways.
57

For simplicity, we set the human wealth of offspring to zero.
A permanent increase in P increases the service cost of housing in all future periods. The substitution effect
is the shift from housing services in all future periods towards current consumption, keeping the present value of
future expenditures constant. The income effect is the change in current consumption due to a reduction in the
58

41

First, due to the Cobb-Douglas assumption, the income and substitution effects exactly
cancel out. Since only the endowment effect remains, this implies that the change in consumption
in (A1) can be interpreted as a pure endowment effect.
However, an alternative interpretation is possible. In this model consumption of housing
services is constant over time. Hence, at any point after the first period of life, an increase in
the price of housing raises the value of an agent’s housing endowment, but at the same time
it raises the net present value of the future implicit rental cost on housing services by roughly
the same amount.59 The detailed derivations behind these statements are in Appendix A.2.
Therefore, the effect in (A1) can also be interpreted as an (almost) pure substitution effect,
with the income and endowment effects canceling out. This interpretation is consistent with
the view discussed in the introduction that housing price effects must be small, because of the
increase in future implicit rental costs. It is important to note that both interpretations of
(A1) are correct. However, the first interpretation will be especially useful in what follows as it
survives in richer versions of the model.

A.2

Decomposition

In this section we derive decompositions of the total house price effect into income, substitution,
collateral and endowment effects and discuss their interpretation both for the simple PIH model
of Subsection A.1 and for the general baseline model treated in the rest of Section 2.

A.2.1

PIH Model

For simplicity, we focus on the infinite-horizon version of the model and drop the individual
P
t
subscript i. The household’s utility function is ∞
t=0 β U (Ct , Ht ). The per-period budget constraints, with a no Ponzi condition, can be aggregated into the intertemporal budget constraint
at date 0:
∞
X

q t [Ct + [Pt − q (1 − δ) Pt+1 ] Ht − Yt ] = (1 + r) A−1 + (1 − δ) P0 H−1 ,

t=0

where q ≡ 1/ (1 + r). Define the implicit rental rate Rt ≡ Pt − q (1 − δ) Pt+1 . Suppose that the
house price is initially constant at P so that the implicit rental rate is then R = (1 − q (1 − δ)) P .
We then want to decompose the response of C0 to a permanent change in P . Define the
P t
Marshallian demand C0 = C0,m (R, I), which comes from maximizing
β U (Ct , Ht ) subject to
present value of expenditures arising from the increased cost of housing in all future periods. The endowment
effect is the change in current consumption due to an increase in the present value of expenditures arising from
the increase in the value of the initial housing stock.
59
The effects are not exactly equal due to depreciation δ. When δ = 0 they are exactly equal.

42

q t [Ct + RHt ] = I. Similarly, define the Hicksian demand C0 = C0,h (R, U ), which comes from
P t
P t
minimizing
q [Ct + RHt ] subject to
β U (Ct , Ht ) ≥ U . The effect of a permanent change
dR is equivalent to summing the effects of identical changes in the price of housing services
dRt . So the standard decomposition result also applies and implies that the total response of
consumption to a change in P satisfies

P

−[1 − q (1 − δ)]
q Ht +
(1 − δ) H−1 .
dP
∂R
∂I
∂I
The first term is the substitution effect, the second the income effect, the third the endowment
effect.
Under the assumption of Cobb-Douglas preferences and q = β, the solution to the household
problem gives a constant level of housing Ht = H0 and of consumption Ct = C0 with
i
X
r h

C0 = α
(1 + r) A−1 + (1 − δ) P0 H−1 +
q Yt .
1+r
Now consider a household that starts at H−1 = H0 (which applies for small changes in R, for
a household that started life at any time t < 0). Then the sum of the income and endowment
effects is
o

∂C0,m (R, I) n
δ ∂C0,m (R, I)
t
− [1 − q (1 − δ)]
q + (1 − δ) H = −
H < 0.
∂I
1−q
∂I
The net effect is small if δ is small, and exactly zero if δ = 0. This capture the Sinai and Souleles
(2005) intuition that when the price of houses increases, and the net present value of implicit
rental cost increases by the same amount, then there are small wealth effects. That the net
effect is actually negative reflects the fact that the consumer is a net buyer of housing since he
needs to replace the depreciated fraction of housing in all periods.
At the same time, we know that
dC0
r
∂C0,m (R, I)
=α
(1 − δ) H−1 =
(1 − δ) H−1 > 0.
dP
1+r
∂I
This implies that the total effect can be interpreted in two ways: 1) a substitution effect that
more than compensates for the negative net of income and endowment effects derived above 2)
a pure endowment effect, with the substitution and income effects canceling each other.

A.2.2

General Model with no Adjustment Costs

Given the household’s optimization problem on page 13, with Pt = P for all t, let C(W, s; P, θ)
denote the optimal consumption policy. Consider the effects of an unexpected, permanent

43

change in price from P0 to P1 . Let (H− , A− ) denote the household initial holdings of housing
and of the risk-free asset. Household net wealth is then W0 = P0 (1 − δ) H− + (1 + r) A− before
the shock, and W1 = P1 (1 − δ) H− + (1 + r) A− after the shock. The total consumption change
is ∆C ≡ C(W
1 , s; P1 , θ) − C(W0 , s; P0 , θ). To compute the collateral effect choose θ̂ such that
(1 − θ) P1 = 1 − θ̂ P0 . That is, consider a change in the collateral requirement that exactly


offsets the change in price. The collateral effect is then defined as CE ≡ C W0 , s; P0 , θ̂ −
C (W0 , s; P0 , θ).




Next, find the value of initial wealth Ŵ such that V Ŵ , s; P1 , θ = V W0 , s; P0 , θ̂ . That
is, we find the wealth that keeps utility unchanged after a change in the price of housing.
Here, we are adapting the logic of Hicksian compensation
 to our dynamic,

 incomplete-markets

problem. We define the substitution effect as SE ≡ C Ŵ , s; P1 , θ − C W0 , s; P0 , θ̂ , where
the change in θ is introduced to mute the collateral effect and the change in W is introduced to
mute the income effect.


The income effect is given by IE ≡ C (W0 , s; P1 , θ)−C Ŵ , s; P1 , θ . Finally, the endowment
effect is just given by EE ≡ C (W1 , s; P1 , θ) − C (W0 , s; P1 , θ), and elementary algebra gives
∆C = SE + IE + CE + EE. Since C(W, s; P, θ) is independent of P , as shown in Proposition
1, we have ∆C = EE. Notice that the exact result of the decomposition, for discrete changes in
P , depends on the ordering (e.g., here we started from the collateral effect). Figure A-1 shows
this decomposition for the baseline calibration of the model.

Elasticity Approximation

This figure shows how the true elasticity and the approximation vary over the entire endogenous joint-distribution
of the state-space in the model with long-term debt but recalibrated with σp = 0.08 to match the volatility of
house prices at very disaggregated census tracts rather than our baseline σp = 0.0459 calibrated to match
the volatility of national house prices. Each point represents a particular combination of all the endogenous
household states and shows the true elasticity for that household state compared to that implied by the rule-ofthumb formula. The R2 for a simple linear regression is 0.90.

See footnote 27 for the definitions of liquid assets and housing values. Liquid assets are net of non-mortgage
debt. The LTV ratio is computed as the value of mortgage debt divided by housing values. Net worth is the sum
of liquid assets (net of all debt) plus housing values. Retirement accounts are also included for households older
than 60. However, following most of our analysis, statistics in this table are restricted to working age households
ages 25-59. Following Kaplan et al. (2014) and Gorea and Midrigan (2017), we trim the upper tail of the income
distribution in the SCF. Kaplan et al. (2014) trim the top 5% while Gorea and Midrigan (2017) trim the top
20%. We use an intermediate value of 10%, but results are similar when using alternative thresholds.

Description of Computational Procedures

In this appendix, we describe the solution to the baseline model and its extensions. The household state vector is s ≡ (A, H, z, P, j), and the model is solved by backward induction from the
final period of life. When working, households solve:

V (s) = max V adjust (s), V noadjust (s), V rent (s) .
The three value functions, for adjusters, non-adjusters, and renters, are given by

The problem for a retired household is identical except that social security benefits replace labor
earnings. At the age of retirement households also receive an additional lump sump transfer to
match the level of retirement wealth which is now liquid, as described in the text. At the time
of death households’ continuation value is given by the bequest motive in the text.
To solve the model numerically, we proceed as follows. First, note that the presence of
random walk house prices with i.i.d. changes xt , CRRA preferences and a constant price-rent
ratio allows us to combine the separate states P and H into a single state Ĥ ≡ P H and instead
solve the equivalent recursive problem:

Note that P 0 = x0 P so that the x0 in the expectation integrates over the possible realizations
of house price growth from today to tomorrow. Given the above assumptions, this enters the
household problem equivalently to i.i.d. discount rate shocks and enters the problem only in its
role in evaluating expected continuation values. It does not enter as a current state since shocks
are i.i.d. and previous values of the shock are fully reflected in the state Ĥ.
In order to rectangularize the choice set and simplify the computational problems imposed by
the endogenous liquidity constraint, we follow Dı́az and Luengo-Prado (2010) and reformulate
our problem in terms of voluntary equity, defined as
Q ≡ A + (1 − θ)

1−δ
Ĥ.
1+r

After substituting the budget constraint into the utility function to eliminate C as a choice
variable, the value function can then be rewritten in terms of the two non-negative state variables
Q and Ĥ. Note that A0 and H 0 are chosen prior to next period shocks to house prices. Thus
shocks to house prices imply that realized Q0 and Ĥ 0 will become stochastic variables which
differ from the value chosen by households today. Namely, given a chosen pair Q0 , Ĥ 0 , the
realized value of Ĥ next period will be x0 Ĥ and the realized value of Q next period will be
1−δ
Q0 + (1 − θ) 1+r
(x0 − 1)Ĥ 0 , where ∆P is the house price shock. This implies that although
households in our baseline model are constrained to always choose Q0 ≥ 0, realized voluntary
2

equity can be negative, for a large enough negative house price shock. To account for this, we
solve the model for states that include negative voluntary equity even though households are
constrained to choose non-negative values for this variable.60
We discretize the problem so it can be solved on the computer by first discretizing z and x0
using the algorithm of Tauchen (1986). We use 13 grid points for z and 5 grid points for x0 .
We then approximate the functions Vjadjust , Vjnoadjust , and Vjrent as mulitlinear functions in the
endogenous states. In our benchmark calculation, we use 120 knot points for Q (we space these
points more closely together near the constraint) and 40 knot points for Ĥ. The presence of
fixed adjustment costs on housing together with the borrowing constraint make the household
policy function highly non-linear. For this reason, we follow Berger and Vavra (2015) and
compute optimal policies for a given state-vector using a Nelder-Meade algorithm initialized
from 3 different starting values, to reduce the problem of finding local maxima. The value of
adjusting, not adjusting and renting are then compared to generate the overall policy function.
We proceed via backward induction from the final period of life.
To simulate the model, we initialize cohorts to match the values of the SCF for age 22-27
year old households. First, we randomly split the sample into two groups to match the fraction
of homeowners and renters. Then within each group, we split the sample into 4 income bins
and assign the median value of housing and liquid assets from the SCF in that same income
bin. (By definition, the value of housing for the renter groups is always zero). The model is
simulated with 100,000 households and house price impulse responses are computed for each
cohort.
In section 5.1 we introduce long-term debt. In this version of the model, non-adjusting
households can increase voluntary equity with no cost, as in the baseline model, but households
who want to decrease voluntary equity when a < 0 must pay a fixed cost proportional to the
value of their house to do so. We also assume that when households neither refinance or move,
they need not satisfy the collateral constraint on new debt, but they must pay off some fraction
of their existing debt: In particular, when refinancing, households face the constraint:
1−δ
P H 0,
1+r
but when not adjusting, they instead face the constraint:
−A0 ≤ (1 − θ)

A0 ≥


χA,

if A < 0

0,

if A ≥ 0

60

Shocks to house prices in the model are not large enough to ever reach a situation where realized Q is so
negative that households would be unable to choose Q0 ≥ 0 without having negative consumption.

3


Given this constraint, we then solve V (s) = max V adjust (s), V noadjust (s), V ref i (s), V rent (s)
where V noadjust (s) now includes the above constraint, and V ref i (s) is identical to V noadjust (s) in
the baseline problem but with budget constraint A0 + C = (1 + r)A + Y (z) − δP H − F ref i P H,
where F ref i is calibrated to match targets described in the text.
We also explore three extensions which do not allow us to solve the problem using Ĥ instead
of separate states P and H. In particular, moving from Cobb-Douglas to CES preferences,
eliminating the constant price-rent ratio, or eliminating the random walk and working with AR
shocks no longer allows us to make this substitution. In this case, we now include P explicitly
as a state variable, which we allow to take on 25 evenly spaced valued from -25 σP to 25 σP .
That is, each node in the price grid is two standard deviations apart, and the overall price
grid is wide enough that no households hit the boundary during their finite life. Re-solving the
model with a finer grid delivers similar results but substantially slows computations. In order to
avoid interpolating between price grid points, we set µ = 0 in these extensions but recalibrate
our baseline model to match the same moments with µ = 0. Since adding an additional statevariable substantially slows the problem, we reduce the grid for Q to 110 points and the grid
for H to 36 points. Solving the problem with this additional state nevertheless is substantially
slower, so we do not recalibrate the model in these extensions. However, these models still hit
the original targets reasonably well.

A.5

Extension: CES Preferences

In this section, we extend the analytical analysis of the frictionless model in 3 to CES preferences
for consumption and housing. This complements the numerical analysis in 5.3, which explores
the effects of CES preferences in our baseline model.
In the body of the paper, we assume Cobb-Douglas utility—i.e., elasticity of substitution
equal to 1—and use that assumption to derive Proposition 1. Here we show that the proposition
can be extended to the case of CES preferences if we make the additional assumption of θ = 0,
that is, if we consider a very loose collateral requirement. In that case, our sufficient statistic
formula extends naturally by adding a new term that is positive in the case of elasticity of
substitution bigger than 1 and negative in the opposite case. Under plausible parametrizations
the magnitude of the elasticity remains large and the Cobb-Douglas based formula implies results
similar to the exact CES formula.
Let the utility function be:

where  is the intra-temporal elasticity of substitution between non-durable consumption and
4

housing services. For simplicity we focus an environment with constant house prices and analyze
the response to a permanent, unexpected price change, but results extend naturally to the
stochastic case.
Proposition 2 Consider the model with CES preferences, liquid housing wealth, and θ = 0.
The individual response of non-durable consumption to an unexpected, permanent, proportional
change in house prices dP/P is

and an intratemporal utility maximization problem. The solution to the intertemporal problem
is independent of P X as it only appears as a multiplicative constant in the objective function.
So the policy X (W, s) is independent of P . The solution to the intratemporal problem gives

Combining this effect with the effect on X through W , yields the desired result.
An elasticity of substitution different from one implies that there is an additional term,
5

proportional to the implicit share of housing services in the total consumption basket. In the
model, this share is tightly linked to the ratio of house values to consumption. For example,
take an agent with housing-to-consumption ratio 3.5—which is the roughly the average for
agents in the 40s bin. With r = 2.4% and δ = 2.2% this implies a share of housing services
to total spending equal to 0.13. For such an agent if  = 1.1, the additional term is equal to
0.1 × 0.13 = 0.013. If the same agent has an MPC of 0.1 the magnitude of the baseline sufficient
statistic is 0.1 × 3.5 = 0.35, so the additional term plays a minor role quantitatively.
