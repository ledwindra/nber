            THE BABY BOOM, THE BABY BUST, AND THE HOUSING MARKET


                                  ABSTRACT


     This paper examines the impact of major demographic changes on the

housing market in the United States. The entry of the Baby Boom generation

into its house-buying years is found to be the major cause of the increase

in real housing prices in the l97Os. Since the Baby Bust generation is now

entering its house-buying years, housing demand will grow more slowly in the

1990s than in any time in the past forty years. If the historical relation

between housing demand and housing prices continues into the future, real

housing prices will fall substantially over the next two decades.

I. INTRODUCTION

     The dramatic rise in the number of births in the 1950s and the

subsequent decline in the 1970s- - the Baby Boom and the Baby Bust- -are widely

recognized as among the most important changes in the United States in the

past 50 years. At the peak of the Baby Boom in 1957, 4.30 million babies

were born in the United States. The year before the boom began, in 1945,

2.86 million babies were born, and at the trough of the Baby Bust in 1973,

the figure was only 3.14 million. En this paper we examine how such major

demographic changes affect the market for housing.

     Our goals are both retrospective and prospective. We want to assess

what impact these major demographic changes have had on the demand for

housing and, further, how these changes in demand have affected residential

investment and the price of housing. In addition, we want to assess what

more recent demographic pattetns imply about the housing market over the

next twenty years.

     Our analysis of both cross-sectional and time-series data leads us to

three conclusions. First, large demographic changes of the sort we have

observed induce large (and mostly predictable) changes in the demand for

housing. Second, these fluctuations in demand appear to have substantial

impact on the price of housing. Third, recent demographic patterns imply

that housing demand will grow more slowly over the next twenty years than in

any time since World War II.

     These findings have important implications fpr the public policy debate

over housing. Between 1970 and 1980 housing prices rose dramatically:

depending on the index, the real price of housing rose between 19 and 32


                                         I
percent. This development generated many calls for government intervention

to help provide more "affordable" housing. Our results indicate that this

increase in housing prices was i.argely attributable to the aging of the Baby

Boom. Over the next twenty years, the Baby Bust generation will be in its

house-buying years. As Kenneth Rosen (1984) has emphasized, this implies

that housing demand will grow more slowly in the future. Our estimates

suggest that real housing prices will fall substantially- - indeed, real

housing prices may well reach levels lower than those experienced at any

time in the past forty years.

    Our analysis proceeds as follows. We begin in Section II by documenting

the facts about the Baby Boom. We show the rise and subsequent decline in

births and discuss the extent to which these demographic changes were

predicted by contemporary observers.

     In Section III we examine the link between age and housing demand.

Using cross-sectional data frém the Census for years 1970 and 1980, we find

that an individual generates little housing demand until age 20--that is,

children do not substantially increase a family's quantity of housing.

Housing demand rises sharply between ages 20 and 30, and remains

approximately flat after age 30. This finding implies that an increase in

the number of births has little immediate effect on the housing market, but

generates an increase in housing demand twenty years hence.

     We examine in Section IV how demographic changes in the United States

have affected the demand for housing. We combine our cross-sectional

results on age and housing demand with time series on the age composition of

the population. We find that the Baby Boom of the 1950s led to rapid growth

in housing demand in the l97Os, and that the Baby Bust of the 1970s will


                                         2
lead to slow growth in housing demand in the 1990s.

     In Sections V and VI we examine how housing demand affects the price of

housing and the amount of residential investment. Section V is in the

nature of an exploratory data analysis of the impact of changes in housing

demand. We are unable to detect a statistically significant relation

between demographic housing demand and the quantity of residential capital.

Residential investment is such a "noisy" time series that the standard

errors we obtain are very large. There is, however, a significant relation

between housing demand and the price of housing: a one percent increase in

housing demand leads to a five percent increase in the real price of

housing. We use this estimated relationship to examine how the slow growth

in demand over the next twenty years will likely affect housing prices.

     In Section VI we use an intertemporal model of the housing market, in

the spirit of the one proposed by James Poterba (1984), to examine the

impact of changing housing demand. One implication of our findings is that

the Baby Boom caused an increase in housing demand in the l97Os that was

predictable far in advance. The model makes precise predictions about how

such a forecastable increase in demand should affect the housing market. We

examine what the model predicts and compare these predictions to experience.

We conclude that the housing market probably should not be characterized as

an efficient asset market in which prices reflect available information on

future demand.



II. THE FACTS ABOUT THE BABY BOOM

     Figure 1, which graphs the number of births over time, shows the Baby

Boom very clearly. The low level of fertility during the Great Depression


                                        3
and the boom in births that lasted from 1946 to 1964 combine to produce a

sharp step in the population structure. As this step aged, it had effects

on the educational system, the labor market, the housing market, and the

social security system.

    One way to look at the magnitude of the Baby Boom is to look at the

number of people at a given age. In 1960, 24.0 million people, or 13.3

percent of the population, were between ages 20 and 30; in 1980 the

corresponding number was 44.6 million, or 19.7 percent of the population.

Since this is the age in which people are forming new households and

increasing their demand for housing, it is clear that the boom should have

had a large effect on the housing market.

     For our purposes, the exact cause of the Baby Boom is not important.1

That the bulge in the population was significant and could be expected to

move up through the age structure is clear enough that it does not need to

be defended. Whether the booni was seen as being temporary or permanent is a

                                        -
tougher question to answer.

     Figure   2 presents the actual number of births per year from 1950

through 1983, and several contemporary forecasts made by the Census Bureau.2

The lesson to be learned from looking at these forecasts is that forecasting

births is a risky business. Any forecast of housing demand that depended

sensitively on births would be highly suspect. Luckily, as we shall show

below, forecasts of housing demand depend (as a first approximation) only on

the population above the age of 20. Thus, housing demand can be forecast 20

years into the future befote the unreliability of birth forecasts becomes a

problem.




                                            4
III. CROSS-SECTIONAL EVIDENCE ON THE DEMAND FOR HOUSINC BY ACE

    We are interested in how housing demand is affected by changes in the

size of different age cohorts. We begin our examination of this issue by

using cross-sectional data to determine the link between age and the

quantity of housing demanded.

     Looking across individuals, the quantity of housing demanded is a

function of age, income, and a variety of other household characteristics.

Yet here we use data on only the first of these attributes: age. Our

ultimate goal is to construct a variable on the aggregate demand for housing

given information only on the age composition of the population. We are

therefore not interested in the value of the true coefficient on age in a

multiple regression. Instead, we are interested in the best predictor of a

household's quantity of housing given information only on the age of its

members. Any correlation of age with income and other household

characteristics does not pose a problem- - indeed, multicollinearity may be a

strength, for it acts to eliminate any worry over the role of omitted

variables.

     We model demand for housing by a household as an additive function of

the demand for housing of its members:

                     N
             D   —   ED.                                             (1)



where D. is the demand of the j-th member and N is the total number of
       J
people in the household. To the extent that there are economies of scale in

the provision of housing services, this would not be the best way to

estimate the housing demand of a given household. Yet if we are interested

in predicting the housing demand of an entire population, and if the extent


                                         5
of household formation is fairly constant, then our approach should be
            4
accurate.

       The demand for housing of each individual is taken to be a function of

age.    We allow each age to have its own housing demand parameter, so that

an individual's demand is given by:

                D. — a DIJMMYO. + a DUMMY1. +
                      0            1      j
                                                        •... + a99   DUMMY99.   (2)
                 J

where DUMMYO—l if age—0, DUMMY1—l if age—i, etc. The parameter a. tells us

the quantity of housing demanded by a person of age i.

       Combining (1) and (2) gives the equation for household demand:

         0 — a EDUMMYO.
                  0
                            + a
                                  1
                                      EDUMMY1. +   .... + a99   EDUNMY99.
                                                                         j
                                                                                (3)
                                             j

We   estimated (3) on a 1-in-bOO sample of the 1970 Census. The sample

consists of 203,190 individuals grouped into 74,565 households. The left

hand side variable is the value of the property for the unit in which the

household resides. For owner occupied units this is reported directly. In

the case of rental units, we used the approximation that the value is equal

to 100 times the gross monthly rent.5 Leaving out units for which neither

of these figures was available, our sample consisted of 53,518 households.

       The solid line in Figure 3 plots the estimated a's, while the estimates

themselves are in Appendix 1. Since the sample is so large, the standard

errors are extremely small (less than $300 for all of the estimates below

age 64). The dotted line in Figure 3 plots the a's for the same regression

run on a sample from the 1980 Census, deflated into 1970 dollars by the GNP

deflator.

       The primary feature of the estimates is a sharp jump in the demand for

housing between the ages of 20 and 30. As mentioned earlier, people below

 the age of 20 have little impact on the demand for housing. The result is


                                                    6
qualitatively the same for 1970 and 1980 data. In the work below we use

only the estimates from 1970.

        A second feature of the results for both 1970 and 1980 is that the

quantity of housing demanded. appears to decline after age 40 by about one

percent per year. This decline is probably attributable to the fact that,

because of productivity growth, older cohorts have lower lifetime income

than younger cohorts and therefore demand less housing.

        A third feature of Figure 3 is the large shift upward between 1970 and

1980.      The real value of housing for an adult of any given age increased

almost 50 percent over this decade. Part of this increase is attributable

to productivity growth: real disposable personal income per capita rose 22

percent from 1970 to 1980. But much of the rise in house value must be

attributable to the 20 to 30 percent increase in the real price of housing.

As long as the price elasticity of housing demand is less than one, an

increase in the price of housing will increase the value of housing. The

large increase in age-specific house value between 1970 and 1980 thus

suggests that housing demand is fairly inelastic.



IV. SHIFTS IN HOUSING DEMAND DUE TO THE BABY BOOM

        Here we examine how changes in the age composition of the population

affect the demand for housing over time. Our approach is to assume that the

age structure of housing demand (that is, the set of a's estimated in the

last section) is constant over time. We can then see how the age structure

of housing demand interacts with shifts in the age structure of the
              6,7
population.

        More precisely, to obtain a measure that we interpret as the shift in


                                           7
housing demand due to demographics, we multiply the age structure of the

population by the coefficients estimated in (3.3) and sum for all cohorts.

That is, if N(i,t) is the number of people of age i in year t, then housing

demand in year t is then

                              —        a. N(i,t).              (4)

We use the a's from the 1970 cross-sectional demand for housing. This time

series on housing demand, which is measured in millions of 1970 dollars, is

presented in Appendix 2. The growth rate of housing demand is plotted in

Figure 4. For comparison, we also present in Figure 4 the growth in housing

demand computed with the 1980 a's.

     The arrival of the Baby Boom in the housing market., appears clearly as a

swelling in the rate of growth of demand that peaks around 1980. The rate

of increase in housing demand from 1940 to 1950 was 1.84 percent per year;

from 1950 to 1960, 1.16 percent; from 1960 to 1970, 1.31 percent; and from

1970 to 1980, 1.66 percent. Our forecast is that the rate of growth from

1980 to 1990 will be 1.33 percent per year; from 1990 to 2000, 0.68 percent,

and from 2000 to 2010, 0.57 percent.

     It is instructive to compare our estimate of the growth in housing

demand with simpler demographic variables. Since our cross-sectional

estimates indicate a large increase in housing demand from age 20 to 30 and

approximate constancy thereafter, our time series on housing demand is not

very different from a time series on the adult population.   The correlation

between the growth in the population, over 21 and the growth in our housing

demand variable is 0.86. Our estimate of housing demand is, however, very

different from the population including children. The correlation between

 the growth in the total population and the growth in our housing demand


                                           8
variable is -0.57. Hence, although our housing demand variable is quite

similar to the adult population, it is not at all approximated by the total

population.

     Figure 5 shows the forecasts of change in demand that would have been

made usir'g Census birth projections starting at various points in the-

postwar period. Despite the fact that birth projections were not very

accurate, in every case forecasted demand growth tracks actual demand growth

quite well for twenty years after the forecast is made. Because of the low

demand for housing of children, forecasts of total .ousing demand made in

the 1960s would have correctly predicted the increase in the rate of growth

of housing demand in the 1970s.



V. FROM HOUSING DEMAND TO PRICES AND QUANTITIES

     In the last section we combined the cross-sectional results on age and

the quantity of housing demanded with time-series data on the age-

composition of the population to generate a new time series on housing

demand. This time series shows that the Baby Boom profoundly affected the

demand for housing in the l970s and that the Baby Bust will have the

opposite impact on the housing market over the next twenty years. Our goal

now is to examine the link between housing demand as measured by this time

series and developments in the housing market.

    We take two approaches to examining how these fluctuations in housing

demand affect the housing market. Our first approach, which is pursued in

this section, is statistical and relatively atheoretical: we examine how our

time series on housing demand correlates with data on the housing market.

Our second approach, which is pursued in the next section, is more


                                        9
theoretically correct but is relatively data-free: we calibrate a variant of

Poterba's model of the housing market and examine how, according to that

model, large and predictable shifts in housing demand should affect the

housing market. We also examine the extent to which available evidence is

consistent with the model.

    The reason we call the statistical analysis of this section relatively

atheoretical is that any good theory of the housing market must take into

account many subtle intertemporal issues. At any point in time, the stock

of housing depends on past flows of investment; the flow of investment

depends on the price of housing; the price of housing depends on current and

expected future rents; the rent depends on the stock and the state of

housing demand. While the model of the next section incorporates all these

feedbacks, here we ignore them. The goal of the exploratory data analysis

of this section is to see what stylized facts emerge.



     Quantities

     We begin by looking at whether there is any correlation between our

housing demand variables and the quantity of housing. We measure the

quantity of housing as the net stock of residential capital.8 In Table 1 we

regress the log of the stock of housing on a time trend and the log of our

demographic housing demand variable. We correct for serial correlation by

allowing the residual to follow a first-order autoregressive process, which

is estimated using an iterated Cochrane-Orcutt procedure.

     The results are disappointing. The point estimate of the coefficient

for housing demand is near zero, but the standard error is extremely large.

We cannot reject that housing demand has no impact on the stock of housing.


                                       10
We also cannot reject that housing demand has a proportionate impact on the

stock of housing--that is, that the coefficient is one.

     Residential investment is of course a highly cyclical component of CNP.

So perhaps it is not surprising that the standard error we obtain is large.

In an attempt to reduce the residual variance, and thus obtain more precise

estimates, we include the log of real GNP in column 2 of Table 1. As

expected, GNP enters significantly and positively. (Since the equation is

almost differenced, it is essentially relating residential investment- -the

change in the stock- -to the change in GNP. Thus, we are picking up the

investment accelerator.)   The coefficient on demand and its standard error,

however, are not substantially tffected by correcting for the business

cycle.

     The next correction we attempt is for the after-tax real interest rate,

which affects the user cost of hàusing and thus housing demand. The after-

tax real interest rate is (l-#) i -    it, where r is the marginal tax rate, i
is the nominal interest rate, and it   is   expected inflation. We take r to be

0.3, i to be the yield on long-ten Treasury bonds9, and it     to   be the average

rate of change in the GNP deflator over the past two years. When this

variable is entered into the regression, in Column 3 of Table 1, it is not

significant and does not alter any of the other estimates.

     In summary, we cannot find a relation between our demographically

driven housing demand variable and the stock of housing. Yet we cannot

conclude there is no relation. Residential investment is just too "noisy"

to allow any firm inference.




                                            11
    Prices

    Next we examine whether there is any relation between our housing

demand variable and the price of housing. We run regressions analogous to

those above: we regress the log of the real price of housing on a time trend

and the log of our demographic housing demand variable. We also include the

log of real GNP and the after-tax interest rate to correct for other

macroeconomic effects.

     The time series on housing prices we use    is   the residential investment

deflator relative to the GNP deflator. It is diplayed in Figure 6. We

choose this series because it is available for a long sample. For the

period during which it overlaps with other existing series, such as that the

median sales price of existing single family houses collected by the

National Association of Realtors, the different series move closely

together. In particular, all series show real housing prices rising sharply

in the 1970s and relatively fIat in the 1980s.

     In contrast to the results for the quantity of housing, the results for

housing prices are encouraging. The results in Table 2 show a strong and

highly significant relation between housing demand and the real price of

housing. In the full specification in Column 3, the coefficient on housing

demand is 5.3, which implies that a one percent increase in the demand for

housing leads to a 5.3 percent increase in the real price of housing. The

t-sèatistic on this coefficient exceeds 9--the correlation between our

housing demand variable and the price of housing is unlikely to be
            10,11
spurious.

     The strong association between housing demand and housing prices also

appears when one simply plots the data. Figure 7 shows the percentage


                                        12
change over the previous five years in the real price of housing and in our

housing demand variable.     The demographic shifts appear to explain the

increase in housing prices around 1950, the fall around 1960, and the

housing boom throughout the l970s.

      Our finding that shifts in housing demand have great impact on

housing prices suggests that both the supply and demand for housing are

highly inelastic. To see why, consider the following static model of

housing supply and demand

          H5       a+bP               b>O
               —   c-dP+D             d>O
where H is log qaantity of housing, P is log price, and ID is an exogenous

shift in demand.     These two equations imply that

          P        (c-a)/(b+d) +   (l/(b+d))   D

For the coefficient on housing demand to be large, as we found in Table 2,

the sum of the supply elasticity and the demand elasticity (b+d) must be

small. Of course, the housing market is not adequately described in such a

static model. Yet even within dynamic models, such as that examined in the

next section, the substantial impact of demand on prices can only be

explained if supply and demand elasticities are small.

     Since we have found a highly significant relation between housing

demand and housing prices, it is natural (at least for the heroic) to

extrapolate this relation forward to see what it implies for future housing

prices. As we have emphasized earlier, the changes in housing demand caused

by changes in birth rates are forecastable far in advance. Therefore, we

can be confident about our predictions regarding future housing demand.

     The implication for future housing prices is perhaps apparent from


                                          13
Figure 7, which graphs the percentage increase in housing prices and the

percentage increase in housing demand. It shows that housing demand will

grow more slowly over the next twenty than at any time in our sample. If

the historical relation between demand and prices continues to hold, it

appears that the real price of housing will fall about 3 percent a year.

More formal forecasting using the regressions yields the same answer. The

regression in the first column of Table 2 implies that real housing prices

will fall by a total of 47 percent by the year 2007. Thus, according to

this forecasting equation, the housing boom of the past twenty years will

more than reverse itself in the next twenty.

     At this point we should interject a note of caution about this

forecast. Every good student of econometrics can recite the perils of

forecasting beyond the experienäe of the data. The predicted growth of our

housing demand variable is lower than has been experienced over the past

forty years, and the period of low growth is protracted. Hence, we cannot

be confident about precisely what effects this slow growth will have. Yet

experience does tell us that slow growth in demand is associated with

falling prices. Even if the fall in housing prices is only one-half what

our equation predicts, it will likely be one of the major economic events of

the next two decades.



VI. HOUS INC DEMAND   IN AN INTERTEMPORAL MODEL

    We now turn to examining the impact of changing demand in an

intertemporal model of the housing market. The model that we use is a

slight variation on that of Poterba (1984). In contrast to Poterba, we

ignore issues of taxation and of the effect of inflation on the cost of


                                          14
owning a home, and concentrate on the effects of changes in demand
                                               12
attributable to demographic changes.



The Elements of the Model

     Let H be the stock of housing. We assume that the flow of housing

services is proportional to the stock of housing. The demand for housing is

given by the equation

          Rd =   f(R)N             f'>O

where R is the real rental price and N is the adult population. N is a

shift variable which is meant to capture the effect of demographic changes

of the type discussed in Section IV. The market-clearing rent is thus given

by
          R — R(h)                 R'<O

where h=H/N is housing per adult, and R(.) is the inverse of f(.).

      We let P represent the real price of a standardized unit of housing.

(We ignore any distinction between land and structure.) For simplicity we

assume that the operating cost of owning a home is some constant, r, times

the value of the house. This constant is meant to incorporate the

opportunity cost of capttal, property taxes, maintenance, and depreciation.

The arbitrage condition for the path of housing prices is


                     R(h) —   rP   -   P   .
                                                            (5)
This equation says that the rent must equal the user cost, which

equals the operating costs minus the capital gain. This implies



           F— rP- R(h).                                            (6)

This equation tells us how the price of housing evolves over

                                                    15
time.

    Gross investment in housing is taken to be au increasing function of the

price of housing and proportional to the scale of the economy as measured by

the adult population:


               H+5H—(P)N                 *'   >0

where & is the rate of depreciation. Let n be the rate of growth

of the population--that is, n—N/N. We can rewrite this equation

terms    of   h rather than H. Differentiating H/N with respect to time and

substituting gives:


              h —    H/N    -
                                n(H/N)                                          (7)

                 —   *(P)   -
                                (n+&)h

Population growth, n, thus enters as a shift variable in the model.

    Figure 8 combines equations (6)and (7) to give the familiar phase plane

representation of the housing market. In steady state, the state variable h

and the costate variableP are constant. The arrows show the implied

dynamics of the economy when it is out of steady state. For any given value

of h, P jumps to the stable arm               and the economy converges to the steady
state.




Simulating a Baby Boom

    Now consider the effects of a hypothetical Baby Boom. The economy is in

a steady state with growth at a rate of one percent per year. In

hypothetical year 1960 it is announced that from years 1970 through 1979,

the growth rate of the adult population will be two              percent   per year, after


                                                     16
which it will return permanently to one percent. As can be seen in the

phase diagram in Figure 9 the price of housing jumps up upon the

announcement, rises until sometime in the middle of the high growth period,

then gradually falls back to its steady state level.

    To get a feel for the potential magnitude of the price changes, we

simulate the model under the assumption that the demand elasticity is 1/2,

the supply elasticity is 1, the operating cost r is 5 percent, and the

depreciation rate S is 2 percent. Although these supply and demand

elasticities are somewhat smaller than is generally accepted, we choose them

to generate large price responses. Rosen (1979) estimates that the

elasticity of demand is about 1.13 Poterba (1984) estimates that the supply

elasticity is between 0.5 and 2, while Topel and Rosen (1988) estimate that

the supply elasticity is about 3. After studying our base case, we will

consider the price responses generated by these alternative parameters.

     The solid line in Figure 10 plots the simulated path of prices. We see

that upon the announcement of the Baby Boom, the-price of housing jumps

about three percent. From 1960 to 1970, the price rises about three percent

more in anticipation of the increased demand. The price rises an additional

one percent from 1970 to 1975, and then gradually falls back to the original

level.   Thus, the price changes generated by the model under perfect

foresight are not very large, and almost all of the price rise takes place

before the increased demand arrives.

     In assessing this forward-looking model of the housing market, it is

instructive to consider a simple alternative: suppose that market

participants are "naive" in the sense that, whatever the price of housing at

a given time, they expect it to remain constant at that level. If this is


                                        17
the case, there are no expected capital gains, and the price of housing is

determined simply by the rental market. That is,

                       P —   R(h)/r.
In the phase diagram, the economy is always on the P — 0 schedule. One

simple consequence of this assumption is that the anticipation of a change

in demand growth can have no effect at all on the market.14

     The dotted line in Figure 10 plots the simulated path of P under naive

expectations. In contrast to the forward-looking model, housing prices do

not begin to rise until the beginning of the period of high growth in 1970

and they reach their peak at the end of the period of high growth in 1980.

The price changes are also much larger. From 1970 to 1980, the price rises

by fourteen percent- - about twice as large as the total change under perfect

foresight.

    In Table 3 we explore the effects of alternative assumptions about the

demand and supply elasticitieá on the path of prices, in both the forward-

looking and naive expectations models. The hypothetical Baby Boom that we

consider is the one described above. For each set of elasticity parameters,

we give the total amount of the price increase in each model, and for the

forward-looking model we also present the amount of the initial jump in

price and the level that the price has reached in 1970, just as the actual

boom in demand is beginning.

    The result that almost all of the increase in price in the forward-

looking model takes place before the actual boom in demand arrives is quite

robust to the choice of elasticities. In no case that we look at does more

than one-fifth of the total increase take place after the boom has arrived.

The result that the total increase in price under the naive model is about


                                        18
twice as large as that under the forward-looking model is also robust.

Raising either the supply or demand elasticity lowers the total amount of

the price increase in either model. In general, alternative assumptions

about the supply and demand elasticities do not change the qualitative

properties of either model. Setting these elasticities as high as suggested

by some of the literature discussed above, however, does reduce the size of

the price increase in both models, but especially in the forward-looking

model, to near insignificance.



Does the Model Fit Experience?

       While we do not formally test the forward-looking model of the housing

market, there are several reasons to think that it cannot come close to

fitting the data. First, consider the timing of the run-up in prices in the

1970s. Both housing prices and our housing demand series rose swiftly in

this decade. But the increase in demand growth could have been perfectly

predicted ten years in advance. In a forward-looking model, most of the

increase in prices should have taken place before the increase in demand

actually arrived.

       Similarly, the forward-looking model does not properly capture the

timing of the turn-around in prices. An examination of Figure 7 shows that

housing prices peaked at almost exactly the time that the demand growth

began declining. The forward-looking model implies that prices should turn

down before demand growth. The model with naive expectations described at

the end of the last section, by contrast, does have the property that prices

turn   down at the same time as demand.
       Second, consider the magnitude of the price increase. The arbitrage

                                          19
condition in the forward-looking model makes it difficult for prices to rise

very quickly in the absence of news. The forward-looking model reacts to

our simulated "Baby Boom" with a price increase of seven percent -  - far   from

the 20 to 30 percent rise observed from 1970 to 1980. Again the model with

naive expectations comes closer to matching the facts: the total rise in

prices in response to a simulated Baby Boom in this model is much greater

than in the forward-looking model, and it takes place over a shorter period

of time.

    As a means of salvaging the forward-looking model, one might argue that

the rise in prices in the 1970s was due not to the anticipated demand

increases in that decade but to the gradual arrival of "news" about future

demand growth. Figure 5 shows, however, that considering the arrival of

news only makes the forward-looking model look worse. The positive news

about demand in our sample period arrived during the 1950s, when it became

clear that the forecasts of bLrths made in the early 1950s were too low.

During the 1970s by contrast, the news that arrived was negative: the low

birth rates of the decade showed that earlier forecasts were too high. News

about births in the l970s should have made housing prices fall.



Is the HousinE Market an Efficient Asset Market?

     Our simulation of the intertemporal model suggests that naive

expectations better characterizes the housing market than does perfect

foresight. In other words, the fluctuations in prices caused by

fluctuations in demand do not appear to be foreseen by the market, even

though these fluctuations in demand were foreseeable (at least in

principle). Thus, the arbitrage condition (6) appears not to characterize


                                        20
housing prices.

     More direct tests also suggest that the housing market cannot be viewed

as an efficient asset market in which prices fully reflect available

information and returns are unforecastable. We can test the proposition

that real housing prices follow a random walk by regressing the change in

the log of housing prices on the change in the log of our demographic demand

variable. We obtain, with standard errors in parentheses;

             A.log P —   -0.06 + 4.7 alog D
                         (0.02)       (1.1)

             N—40    D.W. —   1.36       2 — 0.30       s.e.e. —.0.016

Remember that this housing demand variable, which forecasts 30 percent of

real capital gains in housing, is known about 20 years in advance. Thus,

housing prices are not at all a random walk.

        The failure of the random walk hypothesis for housing prices, however,

need not imply the failure of (6) and the existence of profit opportunities.

If the rent-price ratio moves in the opposite direction from the expected

capital gain, then the total return (rent and capital gain together) could

be unforecastable.       En fact, using the CPI's component for rent, we find

that the rent-price ratio is negatively related to next year's capital
        15
gain:

             log P — 0.03         -   0.024 R/P
                         (0.02)       (0.018)

             N—40    D.W. — 0.99         B.2 —   0.02   s.e.e. — 0.019

Yet this statistical relation is very weak: the R2 is far smaller for the

rent-price ratio than for the change in demand. When both regressors are

included, we obtain:




                                                  21
           M.og P      -0.11    + 5.8     Alog D + 0.024 R/P
                       (0.04)     (1.4)              (0.019)

           N—40     D.W. a 1.41      2 — 0.32           s.e.e. —   0.016

The change in demand remains significant, while the rent-price ratio has the

wrong sign. In contrast to what an efficient market would require, the

rent-price ratio is not the best predictor of the capital gain. It is

possible, of course, that if we had better data on rents, we would find the

evidence more favorable to the efficient markets hypothesis. Based on the

available evidence, however, it seems that the housing market should not be
                                           16
                                                                           —
viewed as an efficient asset market.


VII. CONCLUSION

     We have documented that changes in the number of births over time lead

to large and predictable changes in the demand for housing. These changes

in housing demand appear to have substantial impact on the price of housing.

If the historical pattern continues over the next twenty years, housing

prices will fall to levels lower than observed at any time in recent

history.

     Does our finding imply that readers of this paper should sell their

homes and become renters? There are at least three reasons that such an

action may not be called for. First, there continue to be substantial

advantages to hoineownership. Some of these advantages are attributable to

the tax code and some are attributable to solving the principal-agent

problem that exists between landlord and tenant. Second, there is

substantial uncertainty about future housing prices. Not only are there

unforeseeable macroeconomic developments, but individual regions of the

country will experience housing booms or busts. The best way to hedge the

                                                22
uncertainty about future housing costs is to pay them in advance--that is,

to be a homeowner. Third, most homeowners have unrealized capital gains (at

least in nominal terms). Becoming a renter requires realizing these capital

gains and paying tax at a current rate of 28 percent. For these three

reasons, thnre is no easy way for the typical person to take advantage of

advance knowledge of a fall in housing prices.

    What effect will the fall in housing demand have on the economy as a

whole? It is of course difficult to judge. Since it appears that current

housing prices do not fully reflect low future demand, the United States may

be currently overinvesting in residential capital. When such drop in demand

does become apparent, it is conceivable that we 'ill see a large and sudden

drop in housing prices and residential investment, which may be a potential

source of macroeconomic instability. Falling housing prices may also induce

increases in saving, as individuals perceive their housing equity as

insufficient to fund their retirement. The macroeconomic effects of falling

housing demand appear to be a fruitful topic for future research.

Note: All values are expressed in percent differences from the steady
state. The hypothetical Baby Boom modelled is an increase in the growth
rate of demand from one percent to two percent, lasting from 1970 to 1979,
this increase having been announced in 1960.

1.   Russell (1982) notes that the boom was caused by increases in the
number of women who married and the number of children per married woman,
and the fact that married women tended to have children earlier. In terms
of fertility, the boom can be •seen in the number of births per 1000 women
aged 15 through 44, which jumped from a depression low of below 80 to a peak
of above 120 around 1960, and fell to below 70 by 1980.


2.   The Census Bureau generally provides several forecasts for births,
based on different assumptions about fertility. In cases where three
forecasts were made, we took the middle one; in cases where four were made,
we took the average of the middle two.
       The series of actual births for the years before 1959 was
subsequently adjusted upward to reflect underregistration. The result is
that census forecasts are well below the actual number of births (even over
short horizons for which birth forecasts should be highly accurate). We
therefore adjust forecasts made before 1959 by a constant multiple computed
by assuming that the first year of any forecast was correct.

3.   The 1983 forecast has been more accurate than most of its predecessors,
at least so far. Actual births in 1987 were 3,829,000, compared to a
forecast of 3,879,000.

4.   Hendershott (1987) studies the effects of changes in the propensity to
form households on the demand for housing. We do not deny that such effects
are important, but our primary interest is in changes in demand that are
forecastable; we do not think that such changes are nearly as forecastable
as changes in the age structure of the population.

5.   To test the robustness of this approximation, we ran (3.3) leaving out
rental units and also with the value/rent ratio set to 80, 90, 110, and
120. The results were quite similar to our baseline case.

6.   To obtain the age structure of the population on an annual basis we
combined data on births with estimates of mortality. Actual births are used
through 1983, and the Census Bureau median forecast thereafter.


7.   Our technique is similar to that employed by Hickman (1974); in place
of our estimated &s he uses age-specific rates of household headship.

8.   End of year total net stock of residential capital, constant cost
valuation, from Fixed Reproducible TanEible Wealth. In this measure,
housing is valued at a base year price regardless of the price in the year
of acquisition - - thus it corresponds to a "physical volume" measure (and
not to price times quantity). In 1985 residential capital was made up of
67.9% owner occupied nonfarm; 27.9% private tenant occupied nonfarm; 1.7%
owner occupied farm; and 2.0% federal, state, and local.

9.   From International Financial Statistics; from 1953 onward, these are 20
year constant maturities.

10.   The results in Table 2 also show that the relative price of housing is
procyclical--a one percent increase in real GNP is associated with a 0.23
percent increase in the relative price of housing. While the point
estimates imply that high interest rates exert a depressing effect on
housing prices (a one percentage point increase in the after-tax real
interest rate depresses housing prices by 0.35 percent), this effect is not
statistically significant.

11. Replacing our demand variable with the adult population in the
regressions produces almost identical results. When both our demand
variable and the adult population are included, our demand variable works
slightly better as measured by the t-statistic or the size of the
coefficient. By contrast, when our demand variable is replaced with the
total population, the total population enters with the wrong sign. When
both our demand variable and the total population are included, the
coefficient on our demand variable remains positive and significant while
the coefficient on the total population is negative and insignificant.
Taken together, these time-series results strongly support the validity of
the housing demand variable generated from the cross-section estimates and
the conclusion that children generate little demand for housing.

12. The model we examine is partial equilibrium in nature. For a general
equilibrium treatment of some of these issues, see Manchester (1988).

13. Rosen's estimate, which is based on cross-sectional data, should
probably be considered a longnn elasticity. Over short horizons, perhaps       -


even as long as a decade, the demand elasticity is likely smaller. Moving
costs play a key role here, since they make the demand elasticity zero for
many people. One weakness of the intertemporal model used here is that it
does not distinguish between long-run and short-run demand elasticities.

14.   The essence of this naive model is that the quantity of housing
demanded depends on the current price of housing and-not on the anticipated
captial gain or loss. Other reasons beyond naivete can potentially explain
this behavior- -a binding borrowing constraint is one example.

15. Unfortunately, since we have only an index of rents, we cannot compute
the total return on housing and examine directly whether it is related to
our demand variable.. This also implies that the coefficient on RIP cannot
be easily interpreted. We should note that Apgar (1987) has argued that the
CPI for rent is a bad measure because of changes in the quality of the
rental units over time.

16.   For further evidence on this question, see Case and Shiller (1988).
