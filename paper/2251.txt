Efficient uMyopichi Asset Pricing in Seneral Equilibrium:

A Potential Pitfall in Excess Volatility Tests

ABSTRACT

Excess volatility tests for financial market efficiency maintain

the hypothesis of risk—neutrality. This permits the specification of
the benchmark efficient market price as the present discounted value of

expected future dividends. By departing from the risk—neutrality
assumption in a stripped—down version of Lucas's general equilibrium
asset pricing model, I show that asset prices determined in a

competitive asset market and efficient by construction can nevertheless
violate the variance bounds established under the assumption of risk

neutrality. This can occur even without the problems of
non—stationarity (including bubbles). and finite samples. Standard.
excess volatility tests are joint tests of market efficiency and risk

neutrality. Failure of an asset price to pass the test may be due to
the absence of risk neutrality rather than to market inefficiency.

Introduction
In this short

note I point out some problems in conventional excess

volatility testing, which may lead to incorrect inferences concerning
financial market efficiency. The volatility tests initiated by Shiller
(1981 a,b] specify the

benchmark efficient market price as the present

discounted value of expected future dividends.1 The maintained

hypothesis of risk neutrality that permits the intertemporal first—order
condition of the consumer—investor to be purged of unobservable marginal
utilities of consumption today and tomorrow, is crucial for the validity

of the model and of the excess volatility tests. Using a stripped—down,

one good, one asset version of Lucass (19783 asset pricing model, it is
very eay to get tractable solutions for the equilibrium asset price for
the constant relative risk aversion family of utility functions.
With logarithmic utility, the price—dividend ratio is a constant in
this model, i.e. only the current dividend affects the current asset
price, regardless of the nature of the stochastic process governing

dividends. In this setting it is easy to come up with examples where
the "bubb1efree" equilibrium asset price with logarithmic utility
violates the variance bound derived under the assumption of linear

Or earnings. My note focuses on problems with the excess volatility
tests that are present even when the countless econometric and data
práblems that complicate empirical tests are absent. The earnings vs.
dividends problem is not present in the model used in this note.

utility. Without bubbles and with arbitrarily largesample size, the
efficiently determined asset price would, according to the misconceived
volatility test, exhibit excessive volatility.

II. The Model and the Equilibrium Behavior of the 1sset Price
The model is a baby version of Lucas's [l97) model of asset prices
in an exchange economy. The competitive exchange economy is inhabited
by a representative infinite—lived household with a time—additive

utility function. There is a single non—durable consumption good. The
economy receives each period a random lendowmentH or "dividend" dt of

this non—durable good. For simplicity, dt is assumed to be strictly
positive for all t, to have bounded support and to follow a Markov

process. The household owns a share in this stream of endowments. This
share is the only asset and there are no other sources of household

income. The share is traded and priced in a competitive market.

period t. Pt is the price in period t (in terms of period t
consumption) of a claim to the entire future stream of endowments i.e.
it is the period t "ex—dividend" price of the asset.

household's demand in period t for a share in the future endowments.

the state variable dt and the true model, including the transition

price function co—determined by the consumer's optimizing behavior is
the same as the price function on which consumer decisions are based:
the equilibrium is a rational expectations equilibrium.

(3). The possibility of violating the variance bounds documented below,
is therefore not due to the presence of speculative bubbles (see e.g.
Flood and Garber El9B,)).

Equilibrium in this exchange economy without durable commodities
requires that the endowment be consumed each period or (equivalently by
Wairas' Law) that the representative household willingly holds all
shares to the future stream of endowments, i.e.

Starting with the work of Shiller t1981 a, b], this expression for
the current asset price (or share price) as the present discounted value
of

currently

expected future endowments (or dividends), has motivated a

number of related tests for the efficiency of financial markets.

The dt process need not

be covariance stationary. If it isnt, its unconditional moments are

in terms of the innovations of (possibly non—stationary) stochastic

positive integer n, the innovation based on period t—n information is
—

The innovation variance is defined by

the variance bound in <12> would have been violated and a

rejection of the joint hypothesis of- asset market efficiency and risk
neutrality would have been established.

Riskneutrality or linear utility is, however, crucial to the
correct interpretation of the results from variance bounds tests, as the

following simple example makes clear. Let u(c) belong to the class of

The

intuition is the following:3 with logarithmic utility, the marginal
utility of consumption is the reciprocal of the level of consumption.
The first—order condition (5) therefore becomes:

The marginal benefit from

postponing consumption in period t (the r.h.s. of (5')) is therefore

independent of dt and of current expectations of future dt+1. The
marginal cost of postponing consumption in period t should therefore

also be independent of dt and of current expectations of future dt+.
This requires that the current asset price moves proportionally with the

An excess volatility test based on the linear

utility model incorrectly rejects market efficiency when utility is
logarithmic.

Conclusi on

Conventional volatility tests are joint tests of rational

expectations, competitive market clearing and risk—neutrality. Relaxing
the latter assumption may (and in the examples solved for in this note)
does make it impossible to interpret violation of variance bounds as
evidence against market efficiency.

The optimal "myopic pricing function in the case of logarithmic
utility permits the construction of easy examples of an efficiently

determined asset price exhibiting apparent excess volatility. Finally,
in the perishable commodity universe of this note, a degree of risk
aversion in excess of that given by the logarithmic case (4/ < 0),

generates a negative effect of future expected dividends on the

12

efficiently determined asset price while current dividends have a more

than proportional positive effect! Its hard indeed to test for
efficiency.
