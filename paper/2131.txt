New Estimates of State and Local Government
Tangible Capital and Net Investment

ABSTRACT

Measures of the state and local government capital stock and
investment are necessary inputs into several areas of economic analysis,

including the measurement of national wealth and its growth. We
estimate net investment and depreciation of state and local government

nonresidential capital.

In aggregate, we estimate a net state and

local nonresidential capital stock of $1.8 trillion in 1985, 17% larger
than that estimated by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.
Net state and local government investment has exceeded the state

and local deficit annually for the last forty-five years. While the
fraction of state and local purchase of goods and services devoted to
net investment has fallen, it has exceeded federal government net

capital formation except during defense buildups and has averaged more
than 40% of private fixed nonresidential net investment since 1951.
Similar comparisons reveal that the state and local government net
capital stock substantially exceeds state and local debt, and is about
twice the federal government capital stock.

Introduction

The United States, much more than most other economies, relies on a

system of fiscal federalism. A large number of state and local
government units provide and finance goods and services, such as
education, highways, hospitals, police and fire protection, sewage

treatment, and assistance programs to low income persons. In 1985,
total state and local government expenditure was $517 billion, or 13.0%

of GNP, and more than half the size of federal government

expenditure.1 It is not surprising, therefore, that the state and
local public sector owns substantial amounts of capital, makes
investment as well as consumption expenditures and transfer payments,
and experiences depreciation and obsolescence in the value of its

tangible capital. While most state and local governments keep separate
capital accounts, they do not estimate capital stocks or depreciation.

Yet measures of state and local government capital stock and investment
can be used both to address significant policy questions and as inputs
into economic analyses:
1.

Separating government consumption and investment would present

a more accurate picture of the use of government funds. Government
investment may have different impacts than transfer payments or
government consumption which have the same effect on traditionally
measured deficits or surpluses.

2. Measures of government capital stock and capital services are

1. Economic Report of the President, 1986, pp. 252, 343.

1

necessary inputs into comprehensive measures of national income and
wealth.

3. Government net investment should be considered part of net
national saving, as recommended in the United Nations system of national

accounts. The more complete saving estimate could illuminate trends
and help the evaluation of tax and expenditure policy affecting saving

and investment. It may, for example, be more appropriate to finance
government capital formation than government consumption by borrowing
rather than taxing.

4. Capital and investment measures can improve our understanding
of fiscal history and emerging fiscal issues, such as the alleged
deterioration of the infrastructure.

5. Government capital formation does not have to meet the same
kind of market test as private investment, so we do not have an analogue
to the stock market to value it.2 Measures of capital and investment,
therefore, may provide information which cannot be inferred from other
data.

6. Finally, integration of the federal and the state and local
government accounts may improve various analyses, including those of
intergenerational equity and of short-run macroeonomic issues.

Consideration of assets, as well as liabilities, provides a clearer

2. The value of state and local tangible capital conceptually can be
derived from property values, the age structure of the capital stock,
maintenance, etc., under the stringent conditions for capitalization
(see Starrett (1981)). The federal government has recently considered
much more extensive asset sales than previously, so some additional data
may eventually be available.

picture of the legacy to future generations. Combining federal and
state and local accounts can also advance the debate regarding possible
crowding-out of private investment.3
Fortunately, the Bureau of Economic Analysis has generated
substantial information on state and local government (as well as
federal government and private) investment, depreciation, and capital

stocks in the United States for the past six decades. In this paper, we
use different depreciation methods to develop alternative estimates of

state and local tangible capital. We estimate that the state and local
government net capital stock and net investment are substantially higher

than estimated by the BEA's method. Moreover, the divergence between
our estimates and the BEA's has grown in recent years.

Despite these differences, both the BEA and the current study
conclude that state and local government capital formation is

substantial. Government tangible capital, two-thirds of which is in the
state and local sector, is more than half as large as the private nonresidential capital stock.

In Section 2, we discuss the methodology employed by the BEA. We
compare their depreciation assumptions with theoretical concepts and
with the empirical estimates, based on used asset prices, of
depreciation in the private sector by Hulten and Wykoff (1981) and

3. In recent years, federal deficits have been partly offset by large (as
traditionally measured) state and local surpluses. As federal grantsin-aid to state and local governments decrease, will the state and local
surplus decrease dollar for dollar? If so, little may be gained in
relief of short-term pressure on capital markets.

3

others. We then describe our methodology.
Section 3 presents our principal results: annual series for net
investment and capital stocks for state and local governments from 1927

to 1985. We compare our series to those using the BEA's depreciation
assumptions and double-declining balance depreciation. In aggregate, we
estimate a net state and local nonresidential capital stock of $1.8

trillion in 1985, 17% larger than the BEA estimate. We also
disaggregate the aggregate amount by component of the capital, such as
education buildings, highways, equipment, etc.
We explore some of the implications of our results in Section 4.

We compare the levels and trends of net state and local government
investment with those of state and local deficits and of net federal and

net private nonresidential investment. We present similar comparisons of
state and local government net capital stocks with net debt and federal
and private capital stocks.

We conclude, that for many issues, improved measures of state and

local net capital and investment can be quite important. We also
discuss, in Section 5, some caveats and directions for future research.

2. Methodology
Goldsmith (1962) and Kendrick (1976) both estimated the state and
local government capital stock as part of their pioneering studies of

national wealth. The most recent and comprehensive estimates of fixed
reproducible government capital stocks have been made by the Bureau of

Economic Analysis.4 All three studies use the perpetual inventory

4

method to calculate net capital stocks: gross investment is cumulated

and estimated accumulated depreciation is subtracted. Since our
estimates use the BEA's gross investment series and most of their

service life assumptions, but use a different depreciation method, we
shall discuss the BEA's methodology in more detail.5
The BEA reports annual stock estimates, beginning with 1925, under

current, constant, and historic cost valuations. The gross investment
data for years since 1929 are similar to those in the National Income
and Product Accounts,6 while investment estimates for earlier years

are based on Goldsmith (1955). The average service lives used for state
and local government structures and equipment are based on the records
of government agencies, comparisons with similar assets that are
privately owned, and the assumptions of Goldsmith.

The BEA assumes straight-line depreciation over the estimated

economic service life of each asset. However, within each category of
structure or equipment, the BEA allows for a distribution in service

lives around the mean, reflecting a retirement distribution.7 Since

4. Musgrave (1980, 1986) and Bureau of Economic Analysis (1982).
5. We have benefitted from discussions on this point with Arnold Katz, John
Musgrave, and Allan Young. Any remaining errors in our description are
our responsibility. See BEA (1982) and Musgrave (1980) for more details
on the BEA methodologies.

6. There are differences in the treatment of intersectoral transfers and
certain projects under construction.
7. A truncated Winfrey S-3 distribution is used to assign service lives
ranging from 45% to 155% of the mean.

5

the assets with shortest assumed service lives are retired first, the
depreciation rate for any category of investment slows down once

retirements start to occur. The resulting overall depreciation pattern
resembles a geometric decay.

The straight-line assumption made by the BEA is basically

arbitrary. A more satisfactory approach to estimating economic
depreciation makes use of the observed sales prices of used assets. For
the private sector, Hulten and Wykoff (1981) collected data on used
asset prices from several sources, weighted these prices by estimated
survival probabilities to account for discarded assets, and estimated

the form and rate of economic depreciation. They used a functional form
which included all the common assumptions --

geometric,

linear, or one-

hoss-shay -- as special cases. Although none of the common forms was

accepted statistically, the estimated price-age profiles were found to

.

-

be close to geometric for the classes of assets considered.

8

The

authors then estimated the constant depreciation rate which provided the
best fit.

These results were used to derive depreciation rates for the 32

types of producers' durables and nonresidential structures defined in
the NIPAs. There was sufficient data to estimate some types directly.

8. Hulten and Wykoff (1981) state that "the age price profiles estimated
using the Box-Cox model were very close, on average, to being geometric
in form." (p. 93) The eight NIPA asset categories for which
depreciation rates were calculated directly as averages of rates for
assets they studied were tractors, construction machinery, metalworking
machinery, general industrial equipment, trucks, autos, industrial
buildings, and commercial buildings.

6

The declining balance rates, R, found for these categories were used to
infer depreciation rates for the remainder from the definition 6 = R/T,

where T equals the BEA estimated service life. The average R value for
four equipment categories was 1.65, so depreciation rates for other
equipment classes were calculated as 6 =

l.65/T.

The average R value

for two types of structures was 0.91, so depreciation rates assigned
other types of structures were 6

0.9l/T.

The Hulten-Wykoff depreciation rates are consistent with the
observations of Young and Musgrave (1980) and Hulten and Wykoff (1981)
summarizing earlier studies: equipment depreciates faster than straight-

line in the early years, while structures depreciate more slowly. These
depreciation rates are certainly significant topics for future research.

We feel that the Hulten-Wykoff depreciation estimates are the best
available.

9

In addition to fitting the used asset price data more closely, the
geometric depreciation assumption has important theoretical advantages.
To see this, a brief review of depreciation theory is appropriate.

Christensen and Jorgenson (1973) distinguish between economic

depreciation and replacement. Economic depreciation is defined as the

decline in the value of an asset as it ages)° Replacement is the

9. See Hulten and Wykoff (1981), DeLeeuw (1981), Taubman (1981), and
Boskin, Robinson, and Roberts (1986), for further discussion of the
strengths and weaknesses of the estimates and the used-asset-price
approach.
10. The BEA uses a different definition of depreciation in its theoretical
discussions (see Young and Musgrave (1980)): the value of capital used
up in production. No discounting is used, and for constant-dollar
series, the sum of depreciation over the life of the asset is
constrained to equal the original cost.

7

level of investment needed to maintain an asset's productive efficiency.

The difference can be illustrated by an asset which provides a constant
service flow over its lifetime - -

a

light bulb or a one-hoss-shay. For

such an asset replacement would be zero until retirement, while

depreciation would be continuous as the discounted value of its future
services declines •ll

The appropriate concept depends on the use. For measuring
productivity and capital input, the appropriate capital stock is

cumulative investment less cumulative replacement. For measuring
national wealth, cumulative economic depreciation should be subtracted

from cumulative investment. Replacement equals depreciation only when
productive efficiency declines geometrically as the asset ages.12 Only
with geometric depreciation, therefore, can the same capital stock

measure be used for both purposes. The other major advantages for
geometric depreciation are that relative asset prices are independent of
the rate of return and that no vintage investment accounts need be kept.
The principal disadvantage is that retirement never occurs.13

Of

11. For the "BEA" definition, it appears that depreciation would equal
(1/service life) annually for the one-hoss-shay. This definition is not
accurate for either of the capital stock measures discussed below.
12. See Jorgenson (1973) for a proof of this.

13. This may not be a significant problem in a growing economy. Under our
depreciation assumptions, 6% of the original value of equipment remains
after 24 years, while 24% of the original value of hospitals remain
after 78 years, but this amounts to a discounted present value of only
2% of the original value when discounted at a 3% real rate. In each
case, the BEA assumes the asset has been completely retired. Vintages
of assets which the BEA has completely retired account for less than one
percent of our estimated state and local capital stock in 1985. We
believe that the empirically superior accuracy of the Hulten-Wykoff

8

course, all simple depreciation formulae assume that depreciation is
constant over time and across assets within a category.
Given the empirical evidence and theoretical advantages, we assume
that state and local government assets depreciate geometrically.

Lacking evidence on prices for used government assets,14 we use the
market evidence on used private assets gathered by Hulten and Wykoff;
that is, the depreciation rate for government equipment is l.65/(service

life) and that for each type of structure is 0.91/(service life). With
one exception, the BEA estimated service lives for the various types of
state and local government capital are used to infer depreciation
rates.15 Based on several studies, we assume a 40 year service life

for highways and streets instead of the BEA's 60 year life.16 In

depreciation rates in the crucial early years more than compensates for
excessively thick tails.
14. As mentioned above, conceptually one could infer values of these assets
for state and local governments from information on property values, the
age structure of the government capital, maintenance, etc., but this is
likely to be a relatively formidable task. However, the depreciation
rates for some components are much less likely to resemble closely those
of private assets. Buildings and equipment may be more reasonably
approximated by private depreciation patterns than, say, highways, for
which no obvious private substitute exists. Even those assets with
private analogs may depreciate differently because of potential
systematic differences in maintenance between the public and private
sectors. For example, if state and local governments systematically
deferred maintenance in the 1970s, our net investment estimates would be
too high.

15. The service lives used by us and the BEA are: equipment, 15 years;
educational, hospital, and other "other" buildings, each 50 years;
conservation and development, sewer and water structures, each 60 years;
and, "other" structures, 50 years.
16. A study done for the U.S. Dept. of Transportation (Jack Faucett
Associates, Inc. (1974)) estimated service lives for highways and
streets at 32 to 42 years. Furthermore, Kendrick (1976) and Goldsmith
(1962) both assumed a 30 year service life for this asset class.

9

all our calculations, we use the BEA's gross investment data.

Results

Our estimates of the net investment and net stock of state and
local non-residential capital in 1985 dollars are presented in Tables 1

and 2. These tables also report the corresponding estimates of the BEA,
updated by us to 1985 dollars.17 Appendix Table 1 shows the same
results in current dollars.

We estimate that the net state and local capital stock is at an
all-time high of more than $1.8 trillion, having grown continuously

since World War II. Our estimates of net investment and the net stock
are consistently above those of the BEA, with our 1985 capital stock
18

figure 17% higher. As can be seen in Figures 1 and 2,
have similar trends to the BEA's -late 1960s - -

which

is not surprising since we use the BEA's estimates

17. The BEA 1982 dollar estimates were updated by the price indices used by
the BEA to derive its constant and current cost estimates. Separate
indices are used for each asset type and values differ slightly for
stocks (end of year) and flows (yearly average).
We attempted to reproduce the BEA estimates from the gross
investment and service life data. We exactly succeeded for 4 of the 9
asset types and very slightly overestimated the others. We believe the
differences result from our incomplete data on BEA adjustments for
intersectoral transfers. To correct for this and other possible
statistical discrepancies, we subtracted the excess of our straight-line
estimates over the BEA's from our BRE estimates.

18. An appendix describes data sources and price indices used in the
figures and not referenced elsewhere. We are mainly interested in a
wealth estimate and thus, it is sensible just to add up the value of the
different types of capital. Were we developing a production study, a
Divisia index weighting the growth rates of components by their shares
in income would be necessary.

10

for gross investment and most service lives. The two net investment
series do diverge in recent years, with our estimates about twice as

large as the BEA's since 1981. The differences between our estimates
and those of the BEA are due almost entirely to our slower rates of
depreciation for structures.

We also estimated the net state and local capital stock using a
frequently-used alternative to straight-line depreciation, double-

declining balance. This series is also shown in Table 1. The doubledeclining balance assumption implies a net stock which is 25-35% below

the estimates of the BEA for the postwar period. Clearly, it is not
only the form - -

declining-balance

or straight-line -

- of

depreciation which

matters, but also the rate.

Highways and education buildings, as shown in Figure 3, account for
57% of total state and local non-residential capital, though the BEA

lists seven other categories of investment)9 In Figure 4, net
investment is divided into three major categories - -

educational

buildings, highways, and other. The "other" category is primarily other
types of structures; equipment is less than 5% of the net state and

local stock. The three components have a similar pattern: after
disinvestment during World War II, all three reach peaks in the late

1960s and drop to troughs in the recent recession. The observed pattern
of aggregate net investment, therefore, cannot be attributed solely to

and net investment for all nine categories.

substantial levels of net investment in the highway and other
categories, even in recessions, casts doubt on reports of a
deteriorating infrastructure

Interpretations and Implications

Our estimates of state and local capital and investment can be used
to illuminate important trends and relationships in national saving and

investment. While most of the trends would also be evident using BEA
estimates, we are not aware of other efforts to exploit government
capital accounts in this way.21

As shown in Figure 5, net investment has substantially exceeded the

NIPA state-local other than social insurance funds deficit.22 As

20. Much of the worry about the infrastructure, however, concerns deferred
maintenance. As Hulten and Peterson (1984) point out, maintenance is
not counted as investment. If governments spend less on maintenance
than the private sector, our depreciation estimates may be too low. Of
course, we are examining the entire state and local sector. The
infrastructure may well be deteriorating in some areas while substantial
investment goes on elsewhere.
21. Hulten and Peterson (1984) discuss trends in state and local net
investment.

22. The total NIPA state-local surplus has been much larger than the measure
which excludes social insurance funds and has been positive in every
year since 1968, but much of this surplus has accumulated in pension
funds for government employees. Pension assets and liabilities would
correctly be included on opposite sides of a comprehensive goverment
capital account. The NIPA figures do not properly record unfunded
accrued pension liabilities. Social insurance funds generally cannot be
used by state or local governments to fund operating expenditures or
capital projects. For these reasons, the NIPA "other than social
insurance funds" surplus better measures the current fiscal status of
state and local governments, although the total figure may be useful for
macroeconomic analyses.

12

net investment fell during the l970s and early 1980s, the state-local
sector moved into a budget surplus, so that the net saving done by these

governments has remained substantial. These data indicate that state
and local governments have been effectively financing most of their

investment out of tax and grant revenue rather than by borrowing. The
growth of state-local debt, which would otherwise appear inconsistent
with this argument, may represent arbitrage by state and local
governments as they issue tax exempt bonds and hold financial assets.
The fraction of state and local government net purchases of goods
and services used for net investment has decreased sharply since the

1960s, as Figure 6 indicates. This percentage decreased from 20.7% in
1967 to only 4.1% in 1983, before increasing slightly to 6.1% in 1985.
We add our estimates for state and local governments to comparable
federal estimates23 to obtain the total government non-residential capital

stock and present the results in Table 3•24 The total, which
includes military capital, exceeded $2.6 trillion in 1985, having more

than doubled in real terms since 1945. By comparison, the BEA

23. The methodology used was that of Boskin-Robinson-Roberts (1986) and the
data used were from the 1986 BEA wealth data tape, and additional data
provided by John Musgrave.

24. These should not be confused with total government assets. Here we
consider only fixed reproducible tangible wealth, which consists of
equipment and structures. Boskin, Robinson, O'Reilly, and Kumar (1985)
show that the federal govenment has substantial holdings of land and
mineral rights and Eisner and Pieper (1984) demonstrate the importance
of federal holdings of financial assets and gold. State and local
governments hold similar assets. See Boskin (1982, 1986, 1987) for more
on federal government budgets.

13

estimates, also given in Table 3, have government capital growing by
68% in the postwar period.

With the exception of World War II, state and local government
capital stocks have been larger than those of the federal government, as

shown in Figure 7. Currently, state and local governments own 68.7% of
total government tangible capital. Except during military buildups,
state and local governments provide an even larger fraction of

government net investment, as shown in Figure 8. The surges in federal
investment roughly coincide with World War II, the Korean and Vietnam
Wars, and the Reagan defense buildup.

State and local government capital is much greater than state-local

debt, as can be seen in Figure 9. Though caution should be used in
interpreting this relationship,25 Figure 9 suggests an aggregate

capital account for these governments would show a significant positive
net balance.

We do not have a completely comparable private capital stock
series, but as shown in Table 4, state and local government non-

residential capital was 56.1 percent of Hulten and Wykoff's estimate of

the private non-residential stock in 1974.26 Table 4 also presents

25. This definition of government capital, as noted above, does not
include all government assets. Furthermore, since long-term pension
debt and other obligations are not included, government debt is not a
comprehensive measure of government liabilities either. In addition,
the government capital stock is valued at cost less depreciation, not at
market value. State and local governments might not be able to sell
their structures and equipment and completely liquidate their debt.
26. The BEA state-local fixed non-residential net capital stock, in current
dollars, was 51.2% of the corresponding BEA private net stock in 1974
and 39.3% in 1984 (Musgrave (1986)).

14

our new federal net capital stock estimates and expresses the statelocal stock as a percentage of the total (government plus private)

national capital stock. This figure exceeded 30% in the late 1960s and
early l970s.

State and local government investment represents a substantial

fraction of total national capital formation. Although our state-local
net investment series and the NIPA net private investment estimates
presented in Figure 10 are not strictly comparable because of the
different depreciation methods used, this comparison does provide an

approximation of their relative importance. In several years, net
state-local investment exceeded net private investment, and state and
local government investment has averaged more than 40 percent of total

fixed non-residential investment since 1951. However, state and local
net investment has been falling since 1968, during a period of growing

worry about the adequacy of private investment. Clearly, these
governments have not taken up the slack.

5.

Conclusion
The above results amply document an important fact of life in the

U.S. economy: the state and local government capital stock is large,
and state and local government net investment is an important part of

national capital formation. The investment and capital stock series
exhibit interesting trends and movement, and in part, these depend upon

the depreciation methods used. We have compared and contrasted a
depreciation method based on estimates from used assets sales data with

the traditional BEA method. We believe that there are important
advantages to the former method, although problems remain. Only further

15

research will enable us to determine better methods and estimates of
depreciation for the state and local, as well as for the federal
government, and of course, for the private sector.
If we are to have improved measures of national capital formation,

discussions of fiscal history, analysis of the efficiency and equity of
financing methods for government expenditures, and better measures of
productivity in the public sector, accurate capital accounts become
increasingly important.

A separate capital account for the United

States federal government is being seriously considered. Many of the
issues discussed here are also relevant for the federal government and
have been treated elsewhere;27 however, the state and local capital
stock is perhaps twice as large as the federal capital stock, and the
corresponding flows of investment and depreciation are also quite large.

While state and local governments do tend to separate capital and
current expenditures in their budgeting, no serious attempt is made by
many of them to pay careful attention to depreciation and obsolescence

of that capital stock. The type of information presented here can be
one important component to more comprehensive and accurate budget
reporting, fiscal policy analysis, and national wealth measurement.

Figure 5.
National Income and Product Accounts, 1929-1976: Statistical Tables, pp.
128-29. Implicit GNP deflator from Economic Report of the President,
1986, p. 256. The GNP deflator was used to convert the "other funds"
deficit into 1985 dollars.

Figure 6. State-local purchases of goods and services from Economic
Report of the President, 1986, p. 255. CNP deflator for state-local
purchases of goods and services from Economic Report of the President,
1986, p.257. The GNP deflator for state and local purchases of goods
and services was used to convert this series into 1985 dollars. The
series referred to as "net purchases" equals state-local purchases of
goods and services minus the BRH depreciation estimate.

Figure 9. State-local debt for:
1984 from Governmental Finances in 1983-84, p. 4.
1974-83 from Statistical Abstract of the United States, 1986, p. 262.
1971-73 from Statistical Abstract of the United States, 1978, p. 287.
1952-70 from Historical Statistics of the U.S., Colonial Times to
1970, Bicentennial Edition, Part 2, p. 1127.
1944-51 from Governmental Debt in 1951.
Implicit GNP defaltor from Economic Report of the President, 1986, p.
256. The GNP deflator was used to convert state-local debt into 1985
dollars.

Figure 10. Net private domestic fixed nonresidential investment series
for structures and producers' durable equipment from Economic Report of
the President, 1986, p. 271. GNP deflators for structures and
producers' durable equipment from Economic Report of the President,
1986, p. 256. The NIPA series for private fixed nonresidential
investment in structures in and producers' durables were each converted
to 1985 dollars by the corresponding GNP deflator and the two series
were summed to obtain the net private investment series used here.
