ABSTRACT
In this paper we present a version of the Melitz (2003) model for the case of a small economy and
summarize its key relationships with the aid of a simple figure. We then use this figure to provide
an intuitive analysis of the implications of asymmetric changes in trade barriers and show that a decline
in import costs always benefits the liberalizing country. This stands in contrast to variants of the Melitz
model with a freely traded (outside) sector, such as Demidova (2008) and Melitz and Ottaviano (2008),
where the country that reduces importing trade costs experiences a decline in welfare.

Introduction

In this paper we present a version of the Melitz (2003) model for the case of a small economy.
We show that unlike the case of the Melitz (2003) setup with large economies, the equilibrium
analysis can be carried out with the help of a simple …gure that summarizes the key relationships
in the model. In particular, we show that the equilibrium can be fully characterized by two
conditions that relate the wage with the productivity cut-o¤ for exporters in the small country.
First, there is a “competitiveness”condition, according to which a higher wage reduces the country’s
competitiveness, and this leads to an increase in the productivity cut-o¤ for exporting. Second,
there is a “trade balance” condition, according to which an increase in the productivity cut-o¤ for
exporting leads to a decline in exports and, hence, a trade de…cit. The de…cit must be counteracted
by a decline in the wage, which increases exports and decreases imports. These two conditions give

us two curves, the competitiveness curve and the trade balance curve, one sloping upwards and one
downwards as shown in Figure 1, and their intersection gives the equilibrium.
We illustrate the usefulness of this approach by exploring the implications of asymmetric changes
in trade barriers. With the aid of our simple …gure, we show that unilateral trade liberalization
(i.e., a decline in the variable or …xed cost of importing) by the small economy does not a¤ect
the competitiveness curve but it shifts the trade balance curve downwards, since a lower wage is
needed to restore trade balance after imports become cheaper. As we see in Figure 1(a), this leads
to a decline in the wage and a decline in the productivity cut-o¤ for exporters. The e¤ect on the
real wage is unambiguous: we show that welfare always moves in the opposite direction as the
productivity cut-o¤ for exporting, hence unilateral trade liberalization increases welfare (i.e., the
price index falls by more than the wage).1 Similarly, a decline in the variable cost of exporting
leads to a shift up in the competitiveness curve with no movement in the trade balance curve,
implying from Figure 1(b) an increase in the wage and also a decline in the productivity cut-o¤ for
exporting. Hence, welfare also increases.
In Section 2 we consider the standard case of two large economies and show that a unilateral
trade liberalization by one of these economies shifts both the competitiveness and the trade balance curves down. Changes in the wage and the productivity cut-o¤s of the liberalizing economy
a¤ect the intensity of competition in the other economy, and this is what leads to the shift in the
competitiveness curve. Since both curves shift downward, the graphical analysis tells us that the
wage must fall but it does not tell us what happens to the cut-o¤ for exports. But this does not
mean that the e¤ect is ambiguous: as we establish in Proposition 1, the cut-o¤ for exports falls,
1

In the text below we show that the free entry condition implies that the productivity cut-o¤s for domestic
production and for exporting move in the opposite directions, and also that, as in Melitz (2003), the productivity
cut-o¤ for domestic production is a su¢ cient statistic for welfare. A direct implication is that a decline in the
productivity cut-o¤ for exporting leads to an increase in welfare.

2

and welfare increases in the liberalizing economy.
The proof of Proposition 1 is somewhat involved, so it is useful to consider simpler scenarios
in which one can more easily analyze the e¤ects of unilateral trade liberalization. A common
approach in the literature has been to assume the existence of an “outside” sector that pins down
the wage (e.g., Grossman, Helpman and Szeidl (2006), Chor (2009), Baldwin and Okubo (2009),
and Baldwin and Forslid (2010)). In our graphical analysis this implies that the trade balance
curve is a horizontal line determined by productivity, so it does not move with trade liberalization.
Since unilateral trade liberalization shifts the competitiveness curve down, the result is an increase
in the cut-o¤ for exporters and hence a decline in welfare for the liberalizing country, the result
shown in the literature (see Melitz and Ottaviano (2008) and Demidova (2008)). In Section 3 we
propose an alternative simplifying assumption, namely that the liberalizing economy is small.2 In
this case, the competitiveness curve does not shift with trade liberalization in the small economy,
but the trade balance curve shifts down. Thus, as in Figure 1, the cut-o¤ for exporters decreases,
implying gains from unilateral trade liberalization.
Our model is similar to Demidova and Rodríguez-Clare (2009), but here our focus is di¤erent:
instead of characterizing the optimal policies to deal with the various distortions in the model, we
show that the model admits a simple and intuitive analysis of the equilibrium determination and
comparative statics.3 Accordingly, we focus here on the consequences of a reduction in iceberg
trade costs rather than tari¤s. We emphasize that these two types of frictions have important
di¤erences. This is most easily appreciated for the case of a small economy, for which welfare is
maximized when iceberg trade costs are eliminated completely whereas a strictly positive tari¤ is
optimal (see Gros, 1987, and Demidova and Rodríguez-Clare, 2009).

2

Case of a Large Economy

To demonstrate the advantage of our approach, we will …rst look at the general Melitz (2003) model
of two large but possibly asymmetric economies. We establish that unilateral trade liberalization is
welfare improving, but also note that the existence of general equilibrium interactions among the
two large economies makes the graphical analysis insu¢ cient in this case.4
2

In the Appendix we show that the case of a small economy can be obtained as the limit of the case with two
large economies as one of the economies becomes in…nitesimally small.
3
Our paper is not the …rst to apply the small economy assumption in the CES/monopolistic competition models.
See, for example, Flam and Helpman (1987), who do it in the setting with homogenous …rms. However, in Flam
and Helpman (1987) wages are pined down exogenously by the presence of a homogenous good sector with constant
returns and perfect competition, while we allow for endogenous wages. Another di¤erence with between our paper
and Flam and Helpman (1987) is that in their model the price index in the large economy is a¤ected by what happens
in the small economy, so their case cannot be seen as the limit of a case with two large countries as one becomes
in…nitesimally small.
4
The complexity of the analysis in this setting is caused mainly by …rm heterogeneity. In the canonical
CES/monopolistic competition case with homogenous …rms, the analysis of trade liberalization becomes straightforward, since the number of …rms in each economy does not depend on trade costs at all. Hence, to show that both
countries gain from unilateral trade liberalization, one only has to look at the trade balance condition to …gure out

2.1

Model

Consider two countries indexed by i = 1; 2 and populated by Li identical households, each of which
has a unit of labor supplied inelastically and earns wage wi . There is a continuum of goods indexed
by ! 2 . The representative consumer has Dixit-Stiglitz preferences in each country with elasticity
of substitution > 1.
Each country has an (endogenous) measure Mie of monopolistically competitive …rms that pay
a …xed cost wi Fi to enter the market and draw their random productivity z from the cumulative
distribution function Gi (z). Given z; a …rm from country i faces a cost wi =z of producing one unit
and decides whether to sell in the domestic market and/or export. Firms from i have to use fij
units of labor in country i to export any quantity to country j – this entails a …xed cost wi fij .
Iceberg trade costs are ij > 1 so that for a …rm in i with productivity z the cost of producing and
selling one unit in j is wi ij =z. We assume that ii = 1 for i = 1; 2.

2.2

Characterization of the Equilibrium

Since pro…ts are monotonically increasing in productivity, z, there is a productivity cut-o¤ zij such
that, among country i …rms, only those with a productivity of at least zij decide to sell in market
j. Letting
1 1= , these cut-o¤s are de…ned implicitly by

Next, let us look at the labor market clearing condition that equalizes total labor demand

given by Mie Fi + 2j=1 Lij to labor supply in country i, Li , where Lij is (variable and …xed) labor

what happens with the wage, which is the only unknown variable in this case. (The proof can be found in the online
Appendix available at the authors’web-sites.)
5
In establishing these conditions for the cut-o¤s, we have used four standard results. First, …rms set prices equal
to unit cost multiplied by the mark-up 1= . Second, …rms’variable pro…ts are revenues divided by . Third, revenues
in market j given a price p are Rj Pj 1 p1 , where Rj are total expenditures in j. And fourth, Rj = wj Lj ; since
due to free entry the only source of national income is labor payments.

Trade balance (Xij = Xji ) can then be written as
Mie wi fij Ji (zij ) + 1

Gi (zij ) = Mje wj fji Jj (zji ) + 1

Gj (zji ) :

(5)

To summarize, there are 10 unknown equilibrium variables: Mie , zii ; zij , Pi , and wi for i; j = 1; 2.
We have 9 equilibrium conditions: two free entry conditions, four cut-o¤ conditions, two price index
equations, and trade balance. Setting labor in one of the countries as numeraire, we can then use
the equilibrium conditions to solve for all the unknown variables.6
For future reference, we note here that, as in Melitz (2003), the e¤ect of trade on welfare is
completely determined by the behavior of the productivity cut-o¤ for domestic sellers. Free entry
implies that there are no pro…ts, so the real wage, wi =Pi , measures welfare per capita in our simple
economy. But (1) directly implies that

Hence, to know what happens to welfare as a result of trade liberalization, we just need to see what
happens to the domestic productivity cut-o¤, zii .

2.3

Graphical Analysis

First, let us normalize wage in country 2 to unity, w2 1: We now show how to use the equilibrium
conditions to re-write 2 equations, the zero pro…t condition for exporters from country 1 and the
trade balance condition as the functions of only 2 unknowns, w1 and z12 : But from (1) we get
z12 = h12 (w1 ; z22 )

and
z21 = h21 (w1 ; z11 )

z11 :

(7)

Furthermore, (3) implies that z22 can be expressed as a function of z21 ; and z11 can be expressed
as a function of z12 . With a slight abuse of notation, we write these two functions as z22 (z21 ) and
6

As is standard in the literature, we assume that iceberg trade and …xed marketing costs are such that zii < zij
for all i; j = 1; 2.

z11 (z12 ). Using these functions together with (6) leads to an expression that relates the productivity
cut-o¤ for exporting from 1 to 2, z12 , to the wage in country 1, w1 ,
z12 =

(w1 ) z22 (h21 (w1 ; z11 (z12 ))) :

(CC)

Using again zii (zij ), from (4) we can express Mie as a function of zij only, which we capture
by writing Mie (zij ). Then, using (7) to get z21 (w1 ; z12 )
h21 (w1 ; z11 (z12 )), we can re-write the
trade-balance condition (5) as an equation in w1 and z12 ,
M1e (z12 )w1 f12 [J1 (z12 ) + 1

G1 (z12 )]

= M2e (z21 (w1 ; z12 ))f21 [J2 (z21 (w1 ; z12 )) + 1

(TB)
G2 (z21 (w1 ; z12 ))] :

This is also an equation in w1 and z12 , which together with Condition CC gives us a system of 2
equations in 2 unknowns. We can prove the following result:
Lemma 1 Condition CC implies a positive relationship between w1 and z12 ; while Condition TB implies a negative relationship between w1 and z12 .
Proof. See the Appendix.
As shown in Figure 1, Conditions CC and TB give us two curves, the “competitiveness curve”
that is sloping upwards (re‡ecting the negative e¤ect of the wage has on the country’s competitiveness, which, in turn, raises the productivity cut-o¤ for exporters) and the “trade balance curve”
that is sloping downwards (re‡ecting the negative e¤ect of the wage on net exports, which must be
compensated by a decline in the export cut-o¤ to restore trade balance). Their intersection gives
the unique equilibrium values of w1 and z12 .

2.4

Unilateral Trade Liberalization

We now explore the e¤ect of unilateral trade liberalization in country 1, which we now call “Home.”
We refer to country 2 as “Foreign.”In particular, we consider a reduction of inward variable and/or
…xed trade barriers in Home, 21 and/or f21 . This leads to a shift downwards in the CC and TB
curves (see the Appendix for the proof). In the case of the competitiveness curve, a fall in import
trade barriers in Home encourages additional entry in Foreign and intensi…es competition in the
Foreign market. Thus, to keep …rms with a given productivity indi¤erent about selling in Foreign,
the wage in Home must fall. In the case of the trade balance curve, lower import trade barriers
in Home increase Foreign imports, so to restore trade balance for a given exporting productivity
cut-o¤ at Home, the wage at Home must fall.
The fact that both curves move down implies that, for the case of unilateral liberalization in
a large economy, our graphical analysis does not provide us with the complete description of the
new equilibrium. Thus, one needs to go through the complicated mathematical derivations to get
the answer. Nevertheless, knowing from our graphical analysis that w1 unambiguously falls with
falling import trade barriers signi…cantly helps with the derivations, so we can prove that:
6

Proposition 1 Welfare increases for a country that unilaterally reduces importing trade barriers.
Proof. See the Appendix.
This result stands in sharp contrast to that in Demidova (2008) for the setting with CES
preferences and Melitz and Ottaviano (2008) for the setting with linear demand, where lowering
import trade barriers reduces welfare. The di¤erence arises from the presence of an “outside”good
in these papers and the absence of such a good in the current paper. The presence of an outside
good allows for a Home Market E¤ect (HME) on specialization patterns. Speci…cally, liberalization
in Home makes Foreign a better export base, which results in the additional entry of …rms there
and a decline in entry of …rms in Home. As a result, Foreign specializes in the di¤erentiated good
sector while Home specializes in the homogenous good sector. As shown in Venables (1987), this
results in a welfare loss in Home. Proposition 1 shows that this result no longer holds when there
is no outside good pinning down wages in both countries. Without this good, HME is no longer
operative on specialization patterns. Instead, trade liberalization in Home leads to a decline in its
relative wage, but this is smaller than the decline in the price index, hence, welfare rises.
Nevertheless, our approach proves to be a useful tool even in models in which an “outside”
good pins down the wage as long as there is no complete specialization.7 In this case the trade
balance curve becomes a horizontal line, with the wage determined by productivity levels in the
outside sector in the two countries. A reduction in importing barriers by Home (lower 21 and/or
f21 ) shifts down the competitiveness curve while not a¤ecting the horizontal TB curve, resulting
in a higher z12 , and hence in lower welfare at Home. Similarly, lower exporting barriers (lower 12
and/or f12 ) shift the competitiveness curve up and increase welfare.
In the next Section we will show how the assumption that the Home country is a small economy
used in Demidova and Rodríguez-Clare (2009) helps to signi…cantly simplify the analysis.

3

Case of a Small Economy

Here we assume Home (i.e., country 1) can be treated as a small economy. Compared to Section
2, the small economy assumption requires two changes. First, we assume that foreign demand for
a domestic variety is given by Ap : The term A includes both the national income and the price
index in Foreign (i.e., country 2). In line with the small economy assumption, A is not a¤ected by
changes at Home, i.e., A is exogenous in our small-country setting. Second, the measure M2e of
monopolistically competitive …rms in Foreign is exogenous. However, since f21 > 0, not all foreign
…rms sell at Home, so the measure of foreign varieties available at Home is endogenous.
In the Appendix we show that our small economy model can be obtained from the model of two
large countries as a limit case, where the share of labor in Home, n L1 = (L1 + L2 ), goes to zero.
Formally, we show that if two large countries are symmetric in everything except for size, and if the
7

It can be easily shown that if Home becomes small enough relative to the Foreign ecomomy, it completely
specializes in the production of the outside good. In that case, our approach, which is based on the existence of the
di¤erentiated good sector at Home, is no longer valid.

7

productivity distribution in both countries is Pareto, then in the limit (as n ! 0) we obtain the
three key assumptions of the small economy model, namely: (1) the domestic productivity cut-o¤
for …rms in Foreign is not a¤ected by changes in Home; (2) the mass of …rms in Foreign is not
a¤ected by changes in Home; and (3) the demand in Foreign for Home goods exported at the price
p can be expressed as Ap ; where A is a constant not a¤ected by changes in Home.

3.1

Characterization of the Equilibrium

As before, productivity cut-o¤s z11 and z21 are determined by (1), but z22 is now taken as exogenous,
while z12 is determined by
A (w1 12 = z12 )1 = w1 f12 :
(8)
In turn, the free entry, labor market clearing, and trade balance conditions at Home remain the
same. To summarize, in the case of a small economy, there are 5 unknown variables in the equilibrium, M1e , z11 , z12 , z21 , and w1 , de…ned implicitly by 5 equilibrium equations: equations (3) and
(4) for i = 1, and equations (5), (7), and (8).

3.2

Graphical Analysis

Next, we show how to reduce the system of 5 equilibrium conditions with 5 unknowns to 2 equations
with 2 unknowns, w1 and z12 : The …rst equation is obtained from (8),
z12 =

1=(
12 f12

1=

w1

( =A)1=(

1)

= :

(CC)

Note that this no longer depends on 21 or f21 . The reason is that these conditions no longer a¤ect
country 2 (Foreign) if country 1 (Home) is small. This will simplify the comparative statics below.
The second equation is the trade balance condition. It is the same as in the case of two large
economies except that M2e is now exogenous,
M1e (z12 )w1 f12 [J1 (z12 ) + 1

G1 (z12 )] = M2e f21 [J2 (z21 (w1 ; z12 )) + 1

G2 (z21 (w1 ; z12 ))] :

(TB)

Conditions CC and TB form a system of 2 equations in w1 and z12 . Again, it can be shown
that Condition CC implies a positive relationship between w1 and z12 ; while Condition TB implies
a negative relationship between w1 and z12 : With the same intuition as before, Conditions CC and
TB give us two curves, the “competitiveness curve”and the “trade balance curve,”as in Figure 1.

3.3

Unilateral Trade Liberalization

Consider again a reduction of variable and/or …xed trade barriers for foreign exporters. Unlike
the case with a large Home economy, the competitiveness curve is not a¤ected, and as shown in
Figure 1(a), only the trade balance curve moves down, implying an unambiguous decline in the
equilibrium levels of w1 and z12 . As before, the decline in z12 implies an increase in z11 and, hence,
an increase in the real wage in Home. The reason that the graphical analysis is now su¢ cient to
establish the result is that the CC curve does not depend on 21 or f21 . In turn, this is because
8

if Home is small so there is no feedback from changes in Home to the Foreign demand curve for
Home goods.
We can also use this analysis to explore the impact of a reduction in the variable trade costs
that Home faces to export goods to Foreign, i.e., a decline in 12 . This causes an upward shift
in the competitiveness curve, as shown in Figure 1(b), as a higher wage in Home is required to
leave the export cut-o¤ z12 unchanged when 12 falls. But there is no shift in the trade balance
curve, and hence, we immediately see that the decline in 12 leads to an increase in Home’s wage
and a decline in the export cut-o¤ z12 . The latter implies an increase in z11 and, hence, an
increase in Home’s real wage. Moreover, it can be shown that the log derivative of the export
productivity cut-o¤ z12 with respect to inward and outward trade barriers 12 and 21 is the same8 ,
i.e., d ln z12 =d ln 12 = d ln z12 =d ln 12 ). Hence, we have the following result resembling the Lerner
Symmetry Theorem: in the case of a small economy, a proportional change in import trade costs
has the same welfare e¤ect as an (equal-sized) proportional change in outward trade costs.
A decline in the …xed cost of exporting by Home …rms to Foreign, f12; is, unfortunately, not
simple. Now both the competitiveness and trade balance curves shift with changes in f12 . Not only
does f12 directly a¤ect both curves, but it also a¤ects the relationship between z11 and z12 implied
by (3), i.e., the function z11 (z12 ) in Condition TB also depends on f12 . This makes it very di¢ cult
to sign the derivative dz12 =df12 .

Conclusion

The complexity of the Melitz model has led many researchers to make compromises in the analysis
of trade liberalization in the presence of monopolistic competition, heterogenous …rms, and …xed
trade costs. Some have assumed that trade liberalization was symmetric in spite of the fact that
liberalization was really asymmetric, often even unilateral. Some have instead added an outside
good sector with zero trade costs as a way to …x relative wages, thereby ignoring general equilibrium
forces that are important for the welfare analysis. In this paper we proposed an alternative approach
that has a long history in the international trade literature, namely, that the country of interest
is a small economy. This may miss important feedback e¤ects when liberalization takes place in
large economies, but for many cases of interest it provides a useful benchmark. And the analytical
bene…ts are signi…cant – for example, the analysis of unilateral trade liberalization can be done
with the help of a simple …gure that helps to understand the key forces at play.
8

To see this, consider Condition TB, which does not depend on
and z21 : The last variable is a function of z12 and the product of

12

and

12 21

21 directly, but depends on z12 ; z11 (z12 ) ;
(from (6) and (7) the equation for z21 is

1

f21 f12
f11 f21

1

z21 = 12 21
that any change in either

z11 z22
;
z12
12 ;

or

where from (3), z11 (z12 ) and z22 (z21 ) do not depend on 12 and 21 :) This means
21 that results in the same change in 12 21 has the same e¤ect on z12 .

Now let us turn to the TB condition. Using (4) to solve for Mie , we can rewrite TB as

Equation (3) implies that an increase in zii leads to a decline in zij (for j 6= i), hence, given the
de…nition of i ; we see that i is decreasing in zii : Again, by using (3) for country 1, the RHS of
(9) can be written as an increasing function of z12 ; while by using (3) for country 2, the LHS of (9)
can be written as an increasing function of z21 : It then follows that if z12 rises, then z21 must rise
as well. From (3) for country 1, z11 must fall with rising z12 : Hence, we conclude from (7) that w1
should fall when z12 increases.

5.2

Proof of Proposition 1

Shift in the curves. First, let us show that for any given z12 , a decrease in 21 and/or f21 shifts
down the competitiveness curve. To see this, note that if z12 is …xed, then from (3), z11 is …xed as
1
well. But since from CC and (7); z12 z21 = 12 21 (f12 f21 =f11 f22 ) 1 z11 z22 ; z22 must rise and z21
must fall (from (3) they move in the opposite directions). Hence, from (6) w1 falls for any …xed
z12 :
Now we need to show that for any …xed w1 ; a decrease in 21 and/or f21 shifts the trade balance
curve to the left, i.e., z12 falls for any given w1 . We will make use of the following two equations,
which are just a reformulation of (7) and (9):

z11
= (w1 ) ;
z21
( 1 + 1) = w1 ( 2 + 1) :

(10)
(11)

We need slightly di¤erent argument for the case of a decline in 21 than for the case of a decline
in f21 . Consider …rst a decline in 21 . We proceed in two steps: …rst, we show that z21 decreases
and then we use this to establish that z12 also decreases.
For the …rst step, we proceed by contradiction, assuming that z21 increases given a constant
w1 . From (10), z11 must rise as well. However, if z21 rises, then from (3), z22 falls, resulting in
increasing 2 ; and (from (11)) increasing 1 ; which from (3) implies that z11 falls, a contradiction.
Hence, z21 falls with a fall in 21 :
Having proved that a decline in 21 results in a fall in z21 , we now proceed to the second step and
prove that z12 decreases. We proceed as follows. First, by (3) the fall in z21 leads to an increase in
z22 . This leads to a decline in 2 , which by (11) must be accompanied by a decline in 1 , implying
an increase in z11 and (again by (3)) a decline in z12 .
Now consider a decline in f21 . The previous logic does not work here because f21 enters the
free entry condition (3) for country 2. Consider then a decline in f21 and assume by contradiction
that z12 rises. Then from (3) for i = 1, z11 falls and, in turn, 1 rises so that from (11), 2 must
1
rise as well. Moreover, from (10) we see that (f21 ) 1 =z21 must rise with falling z11 , hence, since
f21 falls, we need to have z21 decrease. But from the de…nition of 2 we have

Since both 2 and (f21 ) 1 =z21 increase, while z21 falls, then the LHS of (12) must increase,
implying that the RHS must also increase, hence, z22 must fall. Then from (3), f21 J2 (z21 ) should
fall as well. But note that
"Z

f21 J2 (z21 ) = (f21 ) 1 =z21
' 1 dG2 (') (z21 ) 1 (1 G (z21 )) :
z21

We established above that (f21 ) 1 =z21 increases and z21 falls, hence, the RHS of this expression
would increase, implying that f21 J2 (z21 ) would increase, a contradiction. Thus, we proved that for
any given w1 ; z12 falls with a fall in f21 :
12

Welfare change. We know from Figure 1 that if both curves shift down, w1 falls with a fall
in 21 and/or f21 : We now prove that z12 must decrease. We proceed by contradiction. If z12
increases then then from (3), z11 falls. This implies that 1 increases, and from (11) combined with
the decline in w1 we see that 2 must increase. At this point, we need slightly di¤erent arguments
for the case of a decline in 21 and the case of a decline in f21 .
Consider …rst the case of a decline in 21 . The increase in 2 implies a decrease in z22 , which
combined with the decline in 12 and w1 implies that the RHS of (6) falls, whereas by the assumption
that z12 increases the LHS of 6) increases, a contradiction.
Now consider the case of a decline in f21 . Using (6) and (7), we can rewrite 2 as
R1
1 dG (')
( 12 21 ) 1 f12 (z12 )1
2
z22 '
:
(13)
R
2 =
1
1 dG (')
f11 (z11 )1
2
z '
21

Assume by contradiction that z12 increases. From (3) for country 1 then z11 falls. Since w1 falls,
then (6) implies that z22 must increase. We know that 2 increases, so the LHS of (13) must also
increase. But since z12 and z22 both increase and z11 falls, the only way that the LHS of (13) can
increase is for z21 to increase. However, z22 and z21 cannot rise at the same time, since in this
case given a fall in f21 ; the LHS of (3) for country 2, f22 J2 (z22 ) + f21 J2 (z21 ) ; falls (recall Ji (:) is
decreasing), while its RHS remains constant, leading to a contradiction. Hence, as in the case of a
decline in 21 ; z12 falls with a decline in f21 : Therefore, from (3), z11 rises, raising welfare at Home.
To simplify the exposition, in the proofs above we have disregarded the possibility that the
competitiveness curve does not shift or that z12 stays constant given a change in 21 or f21 . It is
straightforward to extend the previous proofs by contradiction to show that this is indeed the case
–that is, that neither the competitiveness curve, nor z12 can stay unchanged. This establishes the
strict monotonicity for the result in Proposition 1.

5.3

Justi…cation of Small Economy Assumptions

Here we will show that the assumptions we use to treat Home as a small economy can be obtained
from the model of two large countries, Home and Foreign, with Home becoming small relative to
the Foreign one (the “limit” case). In particular, if two countries are endowed with n and (1 n)
shares of the world’s labor, L;
L1 = nL;

L2 = (1

n) L;

n 2 [0; 1] ;

then the “limit” case we want to explore is the one when n ! 0:
To simplify our analysis, we assume that 2 countries are symmetric in everything except for
their sizes, i.e., f11 = f22 = f; f12 = f21 = fx ; F1 = F2 = Fe ; 12 = 21 = : Also, we assume
b
that the productivity distribution in both countries is now speci…ed as Pareto: G (z) = 1
z
for z b: Then, the free entry condition in country i can be written as

(

To summarize, for given n; the equilibrium in the model with 2 countries can be described by 2

As n ! 0; the LHS of (14) goes to 0. Moreover, the RHS of (14) rises with w (here we use
< 1): Hence, as n falls, w falls as well, and when n ! 0; the RHS of (14)
the fact that ffx B
goes to 0: Note that if n < 1=2; then w < 1: (If w > 1; then from FE; z11 < z22 : But then
in (14), the LHS<1, while the RHS>1, resulting in contradiction.). Thus, the denominator in
the RHS of (14) is always positive and bigger than 1 ffx B . Hence, as n ! 0; we must have
h

for some n 2 (0; 1=2)? The

answer is no, since in this case the RHS of (14) would become negative, while n= (1 n) > 0: Thus,
h
i 1
as n ! 0; then w falls to ffx B
: Moreover, from FE, if n falls, then z22 falls and z11 rises.
Note that due to the Pareto distribution assumption, z22 cannot fall below b; the minimum
value for ; but from the solution of FE, it seems that z22 ! 0 as n ! 0: How to explain this? The
reason is that as n continues to fall, z22 reaches its minimum so that all foreign …rms survive. As
n continues to fall; z22 remains at level b; and the zero pro…t condition for country 2 is violated,
so that FE is no longer true for country 2.9 This also means that we proved assumption (1):
productivity cuto¤ z22 is not a¤ected by changes at Home, when n is small enough.
Now let us derive the new FE conditions for n small enough so that z22 = b and 22 (z22 ) > 0.
While for Home we have the same FE condition as before, for the Foreign country,

be smaller than Fe + f; then for the RHS! 0; we need (z12 =z21 ) =w ! 0 as n ! 0: Using this
