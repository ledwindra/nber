    "abstract": "\n\nThe causal effects of fertility are a central focus in the social sciences, but the analysis is challenged by the endogeneity of fertility choices. Earlier work has proposed several \u201cnatural experiments\u201d from twin births or gender composition of earlier births to assess whether having more children affects adults\u2019 outcomes, though there are limitations to using rare (twins) and weak (gender composition) instrumental variables for fertility. This paper proposes a new \u201cnatural experiment\u201d approach to assessing the causal effects of fertility by measuring the combination of couples\u2019 genetics in predicting fertility\u2014a dyadic genetic instrumental variable, where the key idea (exclusion restriction) is that the interactions of the couple\u2019s genetics that shift the likelihood of fertility is unknown to the couples. We use a nationally representative sample of couples to examine the long-lasting effects of fertility on older adults\u2019 life outcomes, including labor market outcomes, personality traits, and subjective wellbeing. We find that fertility reduces females\u2019 extraversion and years of working and some evidence indicates that fertility reduces both males\u2019 and females\u2019 lifetime number of jobs worked.\n\n",
