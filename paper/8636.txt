The Curse of Non-Investment Grade Countries

ABSTRACT
Mexico was upgraded from non-investment to investment grade in March of 2000. This paper
examines the impact of this event on the properties of the transmission of shocks between Argentina and
Mexico. The paper shows that there is a statistically significant change in the propagation of shocks the
day the upgrade was announced. Furthermore, it is found that the parameters that shifted are those
explaining the diffusion of shocks through the means, while the transmission through the variances
remained stable. Moreover, the change in the estimated coefficients can explain more than a third in the
unconditional comovement that these assets experienced before the upgrade.
From the methodological point of view, the paper offers an identification procedure based on
conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH) that solves the problem of estimation in a linear simultaneous
equations model that can be used in other Macro and Finance applications.

1 Introduction
On March 7th, 2000, Moody’s upgraded Mexican Debt to investment grade.1 The announcement and the
anticipation of the upgrade improved the external conditions for Mexico: average yields of sovereign debt,
as well as its conditional volatility, came down almost immediately. In principle, these improvements were
not surprising.For example, Kaminsky and Schmukler [2001], show that upgrades are associated with lower
sovereign debt yields, lower country risk, and higher stock market returns. However, it has been striking
the fact that since the upgrading Mexico seems immune to the crises in other emerging markets, and in
particular to the turmoil produced by crises in Turkey and Argentina.
Figure 1 shows the daily yields on Argentinean and Mexican sovereign bonds from January 1999 to May
2001. The data is the stripped yield on the JPMorgan’s EMBI+ indexes of these two countries. The series
are computed as the spreads of Argentinean and Mexican foreign currency denominated sovereign debt over
US treasury bonds of similar duration, where the sovereign bonds yields are adjusted by taking into account
their collateral, callable options, and payments schedules. A casual observation of the data suggests that
the two markets co-moved strongly prior to 2000, but have drifted apart since then. In fact, note that the
relative valuation (the spread between the two countries divided by Mexican yields) was relatively stable
and low during the non investment grade period, and has increased and become more volatile afterwards.
[Figure 1]
In this Figure, it is diﬃcult to assign the improvement and drop in correlation to the single event in
March 2000. It can be argued that Mexico was experiencing a continuous improvement. In the empirical
section, it is shown that indeed the change in rating represents a break in the series.
Concentrating in the second moments, the same behavior can be found in the conditional volatilities
of these two countries. In Figure 2, the rolling variance of the yields using a 60 days window is depicted.
Observe that the variances were close prior to March 20002 . Note that, even though these are smoothed
variances, during the Russian Cold (August 1998) the standard deviation of both yields increased by more
than 10 times. Nonetheless, throughout the recent Argentinean turmoil (the Pampaa Pest) the variance in
Mexico has been falling, while the Argentinean variance has increased in more than 5 times.
[Figure 2]
These two pieces of evidence hint that Argentina and Mexico are co-moving less today than years before.
Therefore, it is not shocking that the correlation coeﬃcients have dropped. In Figure 3, the rolling conditional
correlation of the yields is portrayed. The correlation was extremely high during the Russian Cold, and
relatively high during 1999-2000. After March of 2000, it has decreased to an average of less than 50 percent.
&P upgraded Mexico (on March 13th), but not all the way to investment grade.
This fact is consistent with Edwards [1998] and Edwards and Susmel [2000].

The objectives of this paper are: First, it studies whether or not the transmission of shocks was signiﬁcantly altered by the rating upgrade (or its anticipation). Second, the paper analyzes in which dimensions
the propagation mechanism between Argentinean and Mexican sovereign bonds has changed: is the propagation of shocks through means, or through the second moments weaker? Third, it evaluates the predicted
fall in the unconditional correlations that can be attributed to the event. This is a measure of the drop in
the co-movement implied by the estimates.
Before summarizing the results in the paper, it is worth asking why this change in credit rating is of
particular interest. Certainly, upgrades and downgrades have occurred previously. However, in the last ﬁve
years in the Latin American region, there has been only two cases where the rating has moved between
investment and non-investment grades. In 1999, Colombia was downgraded from investment grade to non
investment grade, and in 2000, Mexico was upgraded.3 Because of regulatory restrictions, these two changes
imply a shift in the investor universe, or at lest in the cost faced by a subset of the investors.4 For example,
in the case of Mexico, the upgrade means that now a broader set of investors, such as insurance companies,
pension funds, and certain mutual funds, can hold Mexican debt. Thus, theories of contagion based on the
identity of the investors can be tested in this experiment. The other changes in rating do not modify the
type of investor holding the instruments. Hence, they are not able to assess the signiﬁcance of segmentation
in the investors type as the source of co-movement.
The three main results of the paper are: First, it is possible to reject the hypothesis that the propagation
of shocks is stable after March 7 of 2000. It is important to highlight that the evidence provided in Figures
1 to 3 is at best suggestive. In order to test for the stability of parameters, a more powerful and robust test
is implemented: the DCC test. This procedure allows to test for parameter stability of a linear multivariate
model in the presence of simultaneous equations and conditional heteroskedasticity, which is the set up
studied here. I ﬁnd that the hypothesis of parameter stability is strongly rejected around March 2000.
Moreover, I show that even though there was some anticipation that Mexico was going to be upgraded, the
strongest rejection of the test occurs around the ﬁrst two weeks of March.
The second result is related to how the propagation has varied. Unfortunately, the DCC only provides
evidence that a regime shift occurred, but does not indicate which parameters have changed. In this paper, a
new methodology is developed to estimate the transmission mechanism explained by two channels: the spread
of shocks that occurs through the means, and the diﬀusion that takes place through the second moments. The
contagion literature mostly studies the propagation by the means, with three notable exceptions: Dungey
and Martin [2001], Edwards [1998], and Edwards and Susmel [2000]. These papers study the propagation
of shocks in ARCH or GARCH speciﬁcations. In order to deal with the simultaneous equations issue they
3 There were other changes from investment to non-investment grade for the Asian countries during the Asian crisis. This is
not a good sample to analyze given that it is hard to argue that changes in the propagation are due to changes in the rating
and not to other political events.
4 Investors are not strictly segmented, but one of the components of the investor universe, the insurance companies, has a
lower cost of capital as the NAIC index acknowledges the change of rating. Sometimes (as in the case of Mexico) one upgrade
to investment grade is enough, sometimes at least two are required.

assume exclusion restrictions on the ARCH structure (Dungey and Martin) or estimate the model on the
reduced form (the two Edwards’ papers). The present paper extends this literature and oﬀers a new procedure
that is able to solve the simultaneous equations problem under a more general set of assumptions. The main
conclusions from this exercise are that there is a sizeable reduction on the propagation of shocks through
the means, while the diﬀusion via second moments has remained relatively stable. The estimates indicate
that during the non-investment grade sample 56 percent of the shocks from Mexico are contemporaneously
transmitted to Argentina, and 43 percent of the shocks from Argentina are immediately transferred to
Mexico. These estimates imply a large unconditional correlation in all states of the world (79 percent).
During the investment grade sample the coeﬃcients are 21 percent and 32 percent respectively. This implies
an unconditional correlation of the order of magnitude of 48 percent. As can be seen, the estimates on the
mean equations already imply high unconditional correlations. These conclusion is quite robust to changes
in the speciﬁcation.
The third result evaluates the predicted reduction in the co-movement due to the change in parameters
taking into account the ARCH eﬀects. The estimates imply a reduction in the predicted unconditional
correlation from 80 percent to 50 percent. In other words, around a third of the co-movement during the
non-investment grade period was explained by the segmented market. This ﬁnding supports those theories of
contagion in which the propagation of shocks occurs because trading occurs in a segmented market. Indeed,
it can be argued that the only change between Mexico and Argentina in March 2000 is the fact that now
a larger, and diﬀerent, set of investors is able to hold Mexican bonds. The paper shows that a sizeable
proportion of the co-movement is explained by this channel.
The correlation among emerging market’s sovereign bonds has puzzle many market observers, academics,
and policy makers. This paper has shown that more than one third of that co-movement can be explained
by the segmentation in the bond market. Some of this segmentation is the result of regulation, but some is
also self-imposed. These results have implications on the way we should think about these regulations, the
beneﬁts of international diversiﬁcation, the role of hedge funds in these markets, and the design of the new
international institutions (or what has been called the international ﬁnancial architecture). Contagion is, in
general, thought to be an important source of instability in emerging markets, that hampers their growth
and policies. This paper indicates that a sizeable proportion of that problem is concentrated in the way the
markets function, and not on the countries that suﬀer from it.
Finally, it is important to highlight that the paper studies one single event, and it is possible that the
conclusions are the outcome of idiosyncrasies of that particular case. Certainly, studying a broader sample
is the next step. For example, the segmentation hypothesis could be tested in US corporate bonds.
The paper is organized as follows: The stability in the relationship is covered in Section 2. Section 3
estimates the contemporaneous propagation between Argentinean and Mexican sovereign bonds. Section 4
studies the changes in the co-movement implied by the estimates. Section 5 extends the model and studies
the robustness of the results in GARCH speciﬁcations. Finally, conclusions are presented in Section 6.

2 Is the propagation between Argentina and Mexico stable?
Conﬁrming Figures 1 to 3, Table 1 shows the reduction in correlation between other major Latin American
Countries and Mexican bonds. These are simple correlations, and therefore, an incomplete picture of the
actual shift. Nevertheless, it is striking that all correlation coeﬃcients dropped signiﬁcantly after March 7th
of 2000.5

These stylized facts are not entirely conclusive about the stability of parameters. As has been argued by
Ronn [1998] the use of conditional correlations to assess regime shifts could produce misleading conclusions.6
In order to test for a regime change, then, I run the DCC test.7 The DCC is designed to test for the stability
of a set of multinomial variables that are simultaneously determined and suﬀer from heteroskedasticity. The
test is based on the assumption that the data can be divided in two sub-samples with a known break. The
null hypothesis is that the heteroskedasticity is explained by the shift in the variance of only one of the
shocks in the original system. The alternative hypothesis is that the change in the volatilities is explained
either by parameter instability or by all variances shifting. The test is implemented by (i) computing the
covariance matrix in each of the sub-samples, (ii) subtracting the estimated matrices, and (iii) calculating
the determinant of the diﬀerence. Under the null, the determinant should be equal to zero. The drawback
of the DCC test is that if it is rejected, it does not provide guidance on the reason of the rejection. In this
section, I concentrate on the ﬁrst question, and once the stability hypothesis has been rejected, the next
section studies in which dimensions the relationship has varied.
The ﬁrst step to implement the test is to deﬁne the date of the break. In the Mexican case, the break
was chosen to be March 7th of 2000. It could be argued that the upgrade was anticipated and the true break
should have occurred earlier. This issue is further discussed below.
The second step is to delineate the two sub-samples where the test will be performed. In other words, the
test requires the determination of the windows where the covariance matrices are computed and compared.
The choice of the length of the windows is not innocuous. On the one hand, the test is rejected if the
heteroskedasticity is explained by changes in the volatilities of all structural shocks. Which is likely to occur
if the windows are too large. From the parameter stability point of view, a rejection because the variance of
all structural shocks is changing is non-interesting. Therefore, this points out to the importance of deﬁning
the windows narrowly enough. On the other hand, if the windows are too small, then the estimates of the
covariance matrix are noisy and the size of the test is unreliable. Hence, I use three diﬀerent windows: For
In the case of Colombia, the sample only includes the period after Colombia was downgraded to non-investment grade.
For the limitations on the correlation coeﬃcient see: Ronn [1998], and its applications to contagion: Boyer, Gibson and
Loretan [1999], Forbes and Rigobon [1998], and Loretan and English [2000].
7 DCC stands for Determinant of the Chance in Covariance matrices. See Rigobon [2000c] for a detailled description of the
test. For applications see: Connolly and Wang [2001], Killeen, Lyons and Moore [2001] and Rigobon [2000b].

the non-investment grade period I use the 30 days prior to the upgrading, and for the investment grade
period I use 10, 20, and 30 days.
The third step in the DCC is to compute the covariance matrices, and calculate the determinant of their
diﬀerence. In Table 2, the results are presented. The asymptotic distribution of the test has not been studied,
and most of the results are based on bootstraps. 1000 draws are computed and it has been assumed that
the covariance matrices are correlated across the two samples. The ﬁrst row corresponds to the mean of the
bootstrapped distribution, the second row is its standard deviation, and the last row is the mass above zero.
The distributions are in general not normal. Hence, it is common that the standard deviations are large
relative to their means. Thus, most of the analysis is based on the mass above zero: in other words, if the
proportion of realizations of the bootstrap that have positive determinant is small, then the null hypothesis
is rejected.

Table 2: DCC Test. Argentina versus Mexico.
As can be seen, the mass above zero is small for all three windows. The proportion of realization with
positive determinant are 6.8, 0.5 and 1.3 percent when the windows are 10, 20, and 30 days, respectively.
These results imply a strong rejection of the null hypothesis even at short horizons. Hence, it is safe
to conclude that the transmission mechanism between Mexico and Argentina was altered by the rating
upgraded.

2.1 Rolling DCC
Figure 4 shows the results of running the DCC test in contiguous rolling windows. This is not a test
to determine the break point in the series, rather it is just suggestive evidence on the robustness of the
assumption that the break occurred on Mach 7th. The DCC is performed assuming that the break occurs
for all days ranging from February 7th to April 4th. This corresponds to 20 business days before and after
March 7th.
The DCC was computed assuming that for each break day, one window is the 30 days prior, while the
other window are the 20 days afterwards. As can be seen, the test is rejected at 90 percent conﬁdence for
all days between March 7th to March 14th. There are no other breaks in the windows analyzed.
[Figure 4]
Finally, observe that the DCC is implicitly testing for a break from December 23rd, 1999 until May
3rd, 2000. In other words, it is possible to argue that the anticipation of Mexico’s upgrade did not aﬀect
5

signiﬁcantly the properties of the transmission mechanism. At least a quarter before the actual upgrade. In
practice, countries are placed in the watched list and the time from the placement to the actual announcement
is usually short. Hence, explaining why not a lot of action is found in the data. Remember, however, that
this is not a test to determine the break. Thus, this explanation should be taken cautiously.

2.2 Preliminary Interpretation
The fact that there is a change in the propagation mechanism when Mexico was upgraded supports the
theories of contagion in which the identity of investors explains the co-movement. As was mentioned before,
in the last 5 years only two changes in credit ratings have implied shifts in the investors universe: Colombia
in 1999, and the case studied in this paper. However, a multitude of other downgrades and upgrades have
occurred. Nevertheless, those changes have not produced a signiﬁcant shift in the propagation mechanism.
It is important to highlight, then, that the shift in the propagation of shocks is due to the modiﬁcation of
the type of investor, and not to a liquidity shock. In the sample analyzed here, there were no margin calls
nor liquidity shocks in the bond market. Therefore, the drop in co-movement is not due to a liquidity shock,
but by the expansion in the investor’s universe.
Furthermore, in the Latin American sovereign bond market the three instances in which the hypothesis
of stability has been rejected are: January-March 1995, August 1998, and March 2000. The ﬁrst two cases,
involved large negative liquidity shocks to market participants. The second one implies a swing in the
investor set that could be interpreted as a positive liquidity shock to Mexico. The ﬁrst two shocks have been
short lived, while this one seems to be long lasting.8
There has been, however, few theories that explain the co-movement across markets based on the identity
of investors. Most of the papers in the contagion literature study liquidity shocks in a segmented market,
but not many study the co-movement driven by the segmentation of the market by itself. Two notable
exceptions are Kaminsky and Reinhart [1998] and Gromb and Vayanos [2001]. Kaminsky and Reinhart
study the increase in correlation due to common lenders, while Gromb and Vayanos developed a model of
asset price co-movement in segmented markets with wealth eﬀects.
In both models the shocks studied is an innovation to the wealth of the common lender or bond holder.
However, both models can be easily extended to study the co-movement caused by the transmission of
shocks across countries because country shocks and wealth constraints. The evidence I ﬁnd here supports
the importance of these channels in the sovereign bond market.

3 Estimating the propagation mechanism between Argentina and
Mexico
The previous section shows that the upgrade altered the diﬀusion of shocks between Argentina and Mexico.
Unfortunately, the DCC is unable to indicate what coeﬃcients, or aspects of the relationship, have changed.
In this section, I explore this question. In order to do so, I have to impose additional constraints in the
model. I propose a “structural” ARCH model approach which allows to estimate the diﬀusion of shocks
through means and second moments.

3.1 Identiﬁcation in a structural ARCH model.
This section derives the structural ARCH approach, and studies the conditions for its identiﬁcation and
estimation. To clarify the intuition, the problem is discussed in the general framework of simultaneous
equations. Consider the following system of equations:

Structural Form:
Argt = ca + βMext + εt,
Mext = cm + αArgt + ηt ,

(1)
(2)

where (1) is the Argentinean equation, (2) is the Mexican equation, Argt is the observed yield in Argentinean
bonds, Mext is the observed yield in Mexican bonds, and εt and ηt are the structural shocks. Given the
characteristics of the data, the structural shocks are innovations to country default risk. Sovereign bonds do
not have exchange rate risk (they are denominated in foreign currency). α and β represent the propagation
of shocks through means.
The structural shocks satisfy the following ARCH model:

(7)

In this model, λεε and ληη capture the ARCH speciﬁc country eﬀect, while λεη and ληε measure the spread
of shocks through the second moments. The objective is to estimate α, β, λεε , ληη , λεη , and ληε which are
the six coeﬃcients that describe the diﬀusion of shocks.
Equations (1) to (7) is deﬁned as the structural model.
The most important assumption that has been imposed in the model is the zero-correlation between the
structural shocks: E (ν ε,tν η,t) = 0, which implies that E (εtηt ) = 0. Actually, this covariance restriction,
together with the existence of heteroskedasticity, are the identifying restrictions. Here, I explore the rationale
behind the assumption, while leaving the discussion of the necessity of the restriction for the Appendix (See
Appendix B).
The data analyzed corresponds to the stripped yield of Argentinean and Mexican foreign currency denominated debt. Therefore, by construction, this data has no currency risk, nor US interest rate risk (these
are the spreads over US interest rates). Innovations to these series are mainly default risk, or country risk. It
is reasonable to assume, then, that if the countries were completely isolated, the innovations to default risk in
Mexico should be uncorrelated to the innovations in Argentinean default risk. In other words, under autarky
(α = β = 0) the stripped yields should be uncorrelated. This structural interpretation of the equations grants
the covariance restriction. In this model, the only interrelationship across the country risks comes from the
fact that the two countries trade, share macroeconomic policies, export similar goods to third markets, have
common lenders, share investors, etc. These channels are summarized by the contemporaneous coeﬃcients:
α, β , and λ.
There are four minor remarks that deserve some attention. First, the structural model assumes the
standard supply and demand setup. This is equivalent to assume a latent factor model too. Both models
have the exact same problems of identiﬁcation, and essentially, one is a transformation of the other. See
Appendix C for a detailed derivation.
Second, notice that it has been assumed that the ARCH eﬀects only include one lag. This assumption is
harmless in terms of the properties of the identiﬁcation problem discussed here.
Third, λ is not triangular. Observe that if (at least) one of the oﬀ-diagonal elements of λ is zero, then
the system is identiﬁed. This is equivalent to an exclusion restriction. See Dungey and Martin [2001] for
the estimation of multivariate GARCH models in which this assumption has been imposed. However, in
8

this application, there is no reason to assume that the volatility in one market has no eﬀect on the future
variance of the other one.
Finally, It is well known that equations (1) and (2) cannot be estimated consistently with standard procedures. However, in terms of the standard ARCH and GARCH literature, the simultaneous equation issue
does not represent a problem. Most of the literature studies the predictability of the variables. Therefore,
the estimation is almost always implemented on a reduced form. In this paper, I look at a diﬀerent problem.
I am interested in identifying a structural form by using the reduced form estimates.

Reduced Form: In Appendix A the reduced form is derived from the structural equations. Here, I
summarize the relevant equations. The reduced form residuals are given by:

The reduced form is deﬁned by equations (8) to (12). Note that this is a restricted multivariate ARCH
that can be estimated by GMM or simulated moments. Furthermore, the structural parameters are identiﬁed
from the reduced form estimates. In particular, from the multivariate ARCH, A can be estimated, providing
six equations that have to be explained by the six structural coeﬃcients. Hence, the estimation procedure
computes the reduced form ARCH, and then the parameters of interest are recovered from Â.
The reduced form ARCH model estimated here is quite diﬀerent from the typical multivariate setup in
the literature. In fact, the standard multivariate ARCH has the following structure:

where the most general version assumes no constraints on B (See Engle and Koner [1993]). However, this is
usually complicated to estimate and several alternatives have been proposed : First, a popular approach is
to restrict B to be diagonal or lower triangular. Second, following Bollerslev [1990], it can be assumed that
the conditional moments have a constant correlation. Thus,

Finally, Diebold and Nerlove [1989] and Engle, Ng, and Rothschild [1990] introduced a latent factor ARCH
model, where the factors are assumed to have independent ARCH behavior.
All these techniques impose some type of constraint on the matrix B is order to simplify the estimation
procedure. In this paper, the restrictions on B arise from the structural form equations (1) to (7). In the
particular case derived here, the assumption of zero correlation of the structural equation implies that B (in
the vech speciﬁcation) has a column of zeros, and that the other elements are given by equation (12).
Before estimating the model for Argentina and Mexico it is instructive to discuss why identiﬁcation is
achieved: the covariance restriction on the structural shocks together with the model of heteroskedasticity
of the structural residuals, impose important constraints on how the reduced form heteroskedasticity can
evolve. There is a new literature studying identiﬁcation under heteroskedasticity. Most of that literature
10

studies the case of unconditional heteroskedasticity. In this paper, I extend those procedure to the more
general case of conditional heteroskedasticity. See Fiorentini and Sentana [1999], Klein and Vella [2000a, b]
and Rigobon [2000a]. It is important to highlight that is the combination of both aspects what allows for the
identiﬁcation of the structural parameters. On the one hand, in the absence of heteroskedasticity, the system
would be underidentiﬁed. Even if the structural shocks are uncorrelated the structural parameters cannot be
recovered from the reduced form estimates. This is the typical problem of simultaneous equations. In fact, in
most macro applications the zero correlation on structural residuals is usually imposed, and still the system
needs further restrictions. On the other hand, if the covariance of the structural shocks is unrestricted,
then the presence of the heteroskedasticity does not add any constraint to the system of equations. In the
Appendix this case is discussed.

3.2 Argentina and Mexico’s sovereign debt
In this section, I estimate the propagation of shocks between Argentina and Mexico in the two sub-samples.
The objective is to compare the parameters and understand in which dimensions the transmission of shocks
has been modiﬁed by the Mexican upgrade.
The model is an extension of the structural ARCH described before, where I have included lags in the
mean equation. This does not change the conditions nor the assumptions to achieve identiﬁcation. The
speciﬁcation is as follows,

Argt = ca + βMext + φa Xt + εt,
Mext = cm + αArgt + φm Xt + ηt ,
where Xt−L is the vector of L lags of Argentinean and Mexican yields, and L lags of US interest rates. In
this model the residuals of the reduced form ARCH have the same structure as equations (8) to (12).
The parameters of interest are α, β , and λ.9 The data for the non-investment grade period corresponds
to the daily EMBI+ yields of Argentina and Mexico from January 1996 to March 6th, 2000. The investment
grade sample covers from March 7th, 2000 until May 28th of 2001.10 I compute the reduced form ARCH
using 5 lags in the mean equation, and restricting the conditional moments by using equations (10) and (12).
I estimate the model by GMM.11
In Table 3, the results from estimating the non-investment grade sample are shown. The ﬁrst column is
the point estimate, the second column is the standard deviation computed using the asymptotic distribution,
and, the third column are the simple z-statistics.
9 Additionally, it would be possible to estimate φ and φ . However, I am not interested in the dynamic adjustment of the
a
m
shocks. I am mainly concerned with the estimation of the contemporaneous parameters.
10 The beginning and end points of the non-investment grade sample were changed for shorter periods, and to exclude March
at all. No qualitative diﬀerence in the results were found; and therefore, I report only the results using all the sample.
11 I also implemented an indirect estimation technique as the one described in Duﬃe and Singelton [1993], Dungey and Martin
[2001], Gallant and Tauchen [1996] and Gourieoux, Monfort, and Renault [1993]. The point estimates were very close to the
ones obtained here.

Table 3: Estimated Coeﬃcients for the Non-Investment Grade Sample.
The estimates show that 56 percent of the innovations in Mexico sovereign debt are contemporaneously
transmitted to Argentina, and that 43 percent of the Argentinean innovations are spread to Mexico. Both
estimates are statistically signiﬁcant and economically relevant. Indeed, these coeﬃcients mean that the
minimum possible correlation between Argentina and Mexico is 78.9 percent.
It could be argued that the coeﬃcients are large because in the speciﬁcation there is an omitted variable
that is positively correlated with both country risks. However, remember that in the construction of the
data exchange rate and US interest rates risks have been taken into consideration. Therefore, the only
unobservable is changes in risk preferences in this particular market that are not reﬂected in the US interest
rate. Still, by any measure, this degree of co-movement is extremely large.
The next four coeﬃcients in Table 3 are the propagation of shocks by the variances. As can be seen,
there is a strong country eﬀect (both λεε and ληη are close to one), while the cross market coeﬃcients are
relatively small: λεη and ληε are not statistically diﬀerent from zero.
In Table 4, the estimates during the investment grade sample are presented. The interpretation is the
same as before.

Table 4: Estimated Coeﬃcients for the Investment Grade Sample.
First, observe that the contemporaneous coeﬃcients are smaller than those estimated during the noninvestment grade period. The diﬀusion of shocks from Mexico to Argentina is only 21 percent, while the
transmission from Argentina to Mexico is 32 percent. These coeﬃcients imply that the minimum possible
correlation between the countries would be 48.2 percent. Which is substantially smaller than the one found
in the previous sample.
12

Second, the propagation of shocks through the variances have point estimates that are close to those
obtained before.
Finally, tests of equality of the two mean coeﬃcients across speciﬁcations can be performed. Using the
asymptotic distribution, it is possible to reject the hypothesis of joint equality at 95 percent conﬁdence. In
conclusion, this evidence suggests that the upgrade to investment grade reduced the propagation of shocks in
the mean equation (α and β drop), while the transmission of volatility shocks remained relatively constant.

4 Investor Universe Co-movement
In this section, I analyze the implications of the previous estimated parameters on the co-movement of
sovereign bonds. The objective is to study the predicted fall in correlations due to the swing in the investors
universe.
The base of comparison is the unconditional correlations. 10000 draws of the structural shocks are
generated, and using the estimated coeﬃcients in each of the sub-samples, the new data is constructed and
the implied unconditional correlations are computed. The results of this exercise are presented in Table 5.

Table 5: Predicted change in co-movement.
The ﬁrst row is the variance of Argentina, the second row is the covariance between Argentina and Mexico,
the third row is the variance of Mexican innovations, and the fourth row is the correlation coeﬃcient. All
variables are unconditional; meaning that they were computed using all the sample. The ﬁrst column
shows the results from using the non-investment grade coeﬃcients, and the second column correspond to the
moments obtained by the investment grade estimates.
Two remarks can be extracted from Table 5. First, the predicted unconditional correlations are close to
the actual ones shown in Table 1. During the non-investment grade period the unconditional correlation in
the data is 88 percent, while the predicted one is 80 percent. In the investment grade sample, the predicted
correlation is 51 percent and the sample one is 44. Obviously these are within sample comparisons, but the
model ﬁts remarkably well these unconditional correlations.
Second, 36 percent of the correlation is explained by the change in the investors universe. Note that the
reduction in unconditional correlations is 29 percent (81 − 51), which as a percentage of the non-investment
grade unconditional correlation is more than a third. Furthermore, this reduction would have been even
larger if markets were calm. The fact that Argentina is going through a major crisis implies that the
variance of both countries (and their covariance) are larger, biasing upward the correlation estimates. This
evidence indicates that a sizeable proportion of the co-movement across markets is due to the segmentation
13

of the investors universe.
It could be argued that the reduction in the correlation is because during the non-investment grade
sample several crises increased the co-movement between Argentina and Mexico. However, this is not the
case. These estimates are qualitatively the same as those obtained if only one year of the non-investment
grade sample is used. The reason to perform this exercise is that from March 1999 to March 2000 there was
no major liquidity shock in the bond market. The estimates of this sub-sample are shown in Table 6.

Table 6: Estimated Coeﬃcients for the Non-Investment Grade Sample. Using only one year of data.
Note that the coeﬃcients are very close to those in Table 3. In fact, the null hypothesis that the coeﬃcients
are the same cannot be rejected at a reasonable conﬁdence (at least 85 percent conﬁdence). These coeﬃcients
imply an unconditional correlation of 77 percent, and a minimum possible correlation of 72 percent. Results
that are strikingly close to those using the whole sample.
The implication of these results is that the reduction in the correlation cannot be explained because
during the non-investment grade there were more common shocks than afterwards. Indeed, if something has
happen is the opposite. During the investment grade sample the emerging economies have been subject to
Turkey and Argentina’s turmoils. Which reverses the previous logic.
Hence, the results point to the conclusion that in smaller and more segmented investor’s markets, asset
prices tend to be more correlated.

5 Robustness
There are several questions that can arise from the previous speciﬁcation. First, what happen to the estimates
if the break occurs before March 7th. Second, here I have implemented an ARCH speciﬁcation, but it is
possible that the true model has GARCH eﬀects. Third, the non-investment grade sample includes several
important aggregate shocks (The Russian Cold, and the Brazilian Sneeze are particularly important).
Regarding the ﬁrst question, it should be clear that in this model if the break occurs before the estimates
during the non-investment grade sample are biased downward. Therefore, the drop in coeﬃcients is larger
than the ones I have reported above.
Part of the second complaint was address before when the non-investment grade sample was restricted
14

to one year. However, here I discuss both questions further. Assume the data is explained by the following
“structural” GARCH can be estimated, where the mean equation is the same as before:

Argt = ca + βMext + φa Xt + εt,
Mext = cm + αArgt + φm Xt + ηt ,
and where the structural shocks have the same constraints (3), (4) and (5), but where the conditional variance
equation is extended to include GARCH eﬀects:

where γ and λ are matrices. Observe that it is easy to show that the reduced form GARCH has a similar

I estimated the GARCH model for three diﬀerent non-investment grade samples: All the sample, from
March 1st 1998 to March 6th 2000, and from March 1st 1999 to March 6th 2000. This evaluates how sensitive
the parameters are to the inclusion or not of previous turmoil periods. The results are presented in Table 7

6 Conclusions
This paper examines the properties of the transmission of shocks between Mexico and Argentina before and
after Mexico was upgraded from non-investment grade to investment grade. The contributions of the paper
are twofold: The ﬁrst one is related to the relationship between Mexico and Argentina, and the second one
15

is methodological.
I show that the upgrade implied a signiﬁcant regime shift. The estimates of the contemporaneous relationship between Argentinean and Mexican sovereign bonds indicate that most of the change occurred
in the propagation of shocks through the mean equation, while the diﬀusion through the second moments
remained relatively stable. Finally, the last section argues that more than one third of the co-movement has
been reduced by the upgrade. The evidence provided in this paper suggests that the change in the investor’s
universe is the cause of the reduction in co-movement. The paper argues that even though there has not
been a liquidity shock or wealth shock to investors that could explain the lack of co-movement (recently), the
change in investors universe makes recent wealth shocks less important. Further research should continue
exploring this channel.
From the methodological point of view, the paper oﬀers a new identiﬁcation procedure to solve the
problem of simultaneous equations when the data suﬀers from conditional heteroskedasticity. The present
paper is a ﬁrst pass to the estimation of this type of structural ARCH models. And clearly the model
describing the bond yields is very simple. Future research should generalize the present speciﬁcation to deal
with more complex setups.

In order to derive the reduced form ARCH, I construct a vech speciﬁcation in the spirit of Bollerslev,

expectations on the conditional reduced form residuals can be written in terms of hε,t , and hη,t. Deﬁne
hArg,t ≡ Eω 2Arg,t , hArgMex,t ≡ EωArg,t ωMex,t , and hMex,t ≡ Eω 2Mex,t, then

The zero covariance restriction on the structural shocks allows us to express the structural conditional
moments as a function of only two of the reduced form conditional moments. Conversely, if the covariance is
unrestricted, then the moments of the structural form residuals are three, and they require all three reduced
form moments to been able to write them. See next Appendix.

B Lack of identiﬁcation under an unconstrained structural model.
This section studies the case in which a common heteroskedastic shock is included in the speciﬁcation. It
shows that identiﬁcation of the structural parameters is not achieved. To simplify the exposition assume the
constants in the mean equation are zero.
Assume that the structural model is:

Argt = βMext + γzt + εt,
Mext = αArgt + zt + ηt,
where zt is a common shock. Assume the structural shocks satisfy the following ARCH model:

The inclusion of a heteroskedastic common shock is equivalent to assume no restrictions on the covariance
between εt and ηt. This model is simpler from the expositional point of view.

where ωArg,t and ωMex,t are the reduced form innovations. From the structural equations, the expected

Finally, using the reduced form equations the structural errors ε2t−1 , η 2t−1 , and zt2−1 can be written in terms of
ω2Arg,t−1 , ωArg,t−1 ωMex,t−1 , and ω 2Mex,t−1 . This implies that the reduced form ARCH model can be written
as

where B is a three by three matrix.
Note that from the reduced form the number of estimable parameters from B is nine, while the number
of structural form coeﬃcients is 12: three from the mean equations (α, β , γ ) plus nine from the ARCH
model (λ). Thus, the system is underidentiﬁed.
As was indicated above, the reason why the identiﬁcation is not achieved in this case is because the
structural assumptions impose no constraints on the reduced form. Note that indeed, the reduced form
obtained here is the unrestricted vech setup

C Equivalence between the supply-demand speciﬁcation and the
latent factor model.
The structural form assumed is the following:

Argt = ca + βMext + εt,
Mext = cm + αArgt + ηt ,
several papers have adopted a latent factor model as follows:

Argt = ca + γ a ηt + εt ,
Mext = cm + γ m εt + ηt .



The two models are equivalent. Solving for the country yields in the ﬁrst, the following reduced form is
found:

Argt

=

Mext

=

ca + 1 −1αβ (βηt + εt ) ,


cm + 1 −1αβ (ηt + αεt) .


Note that if the variance of the structural shocks are normalized by 1−1αβ , then γa = β , and γm = α. The
constants satisfy ca = 1 1αβ (ca + βcm ) and cm = 1 1αβ (αca + cm ). Therefore, the two models produce the
exact same reduced form implications, and even the interpretation of the coeﬃcients is the same. The only
diﬀerence is in the size of the variance of the identiﬁed shocks.
