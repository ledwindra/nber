A Reappraisal of Recent Tests of the
Permanent Income Hypothesis
ABSTRACT

Hall (1978) showed that the permanent income hypothesis implies that
consumption (1) follows a random walk, and (2) cannot be predicted by past

income. Reexamination of Hall's data results in rejection of the random walk
hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis of positively autocorrelated

changes. Evidently this is due to Hall's choice of a quadratic utility
function. A logrithmic utility function implies a random walk in the log of
consumption which is supported by the data.

Hall reported that past income had a negative but insignificant relation

to consumption. Changes in the log of income, however, do have a positive
predictive relation to changes in the log of consumption. The adjustment of
consumption to income seems to be spread over two quarters.

Flavin's (1981) test of the theory is formally equivalent to Hall's except
for assuming stationarity around a time trend. Mankiw and Shapiro (198L+) have
pointed out that the effect of detrending may be to tend to rejection of the

theory when it is in fact correct. For Hall's data the effect of detrending
is to reverse the sign of the coefficient on past income. Its magnitude is
what the Mankiw—Shapiro analysis predicts under the permanent income
hypothesis.

Introduction

Recent tests of the permanent income/life—cycle hypothesis exploit the

implications of the theory for the time series properties of consumption

and its relationship to income. In particular, Hall (1978) showed that
(1)

consumption should follow a random walk with drift, and (2) changes

in consumption should be uncorrelated with lagged values of other
variables, including income. Hall concluded from tests based on quarterly
U.S. per capita data that consumption does indeed behave like a random walk

and that past values of income are only marginally useful in predicting

consumption in the presence of past consumption. This encouraging
assessment seems to be dashed by the contradictory conclusion of a
subsequent paper by Flavin (1981) who claims to find evidence implying
decisive rejection of the permanent income hypothesis in the form of an
'excess sensitivity' of consumption to income. The objective of this paper

is to take another look at the evidence presented in these two papers and

examine the sources of their differing conclusions. Briefly, I conclude
that Hall's data are more strongly at variance with his hypothesis than his

tests suggest, but that Flavin's negative results are due at least in part

to inappropriate detrending of consumption and income as suggested in a
recent paper by Mankiw and Shapiro (1984).

2.

flail's Model

The basic theoretical result from which Hall proceeds is that
consumers maximizing the expectation of the utility of future consumption
subject to the present value of uncertain future income will adjust curreiit

expenditures so that

1

E[u'(ct+i)] =

[(l+&)/(l+r) ]u'(c)

whereEt[ ] denotes expectation as of time t, u(c) is the contribution of
current consumption to utility, 6 is the rate of time preference, and r is

the real interest rate. This is the expected value version of the
condition that marginal utilities of consumption, appropriately discounted,

will be equated across time periods. In the case of a quadratic utility
function the conditional expectation of consumption next period is

E(ct÷i)

[(r—&)/(1+rfl + [(i.+&)/(i+r)]ct

because marginal utility is linear in consumption with c being the bliss

level of consumption. Since r must be greater than &, the intercept is
positive and since 6 and r are both small the slope is close to but less
than unity.

The realized value of Ct÷i will be this conditional expectation plus a

random error, that is a random walk with drift or very nearly so.
Estimating the model over Hall's sample period (quarterly, 1948:1—1977:1)

using his variable definitions but revised data from Business Statistics

1982 I obtained results using SHAZAM (White, 1978) which are nearly
identical to those reported by Hall,

Ct =

SE =

—13.9 + 1.011 Ct_i + e
(7.7)
(.003)

13.9;

R2 = .9989; D.W. =

1.70.

Standard errors are in parentheses below the coefficients. Hall interprets

these results as supporting the random walk hypothesis. I find these
results less encouraging. The theory predicts a positive intercept, not a

2

negative one. It also predicts a slope close to but less than unity, but

the estimated slope is larger than unity. In addition, we know that the
least squares slope in these models is downward biased; see Fuller (1976)
and Evans and Savin (1984). The Durbin—Watson statistic is not appropriate

for testing the hypothesis of serially random errors in a model with a
lagged dependent variable. The h—statistic suggested by Du.rbin (1970) for

these situations is standard normal under the null hypothesis. Its
computed value is 1.58 in this instance which is significant at the .05

level against the alternative of positive autocorrelation which would
correspond to the usual notion of a business cycle.

To see whether prior values of consumption have predictive power,
which would contradict the theory, Hall adds three more lags of consumption

to the regression. My near—replication is

Ct

—8.6 +
(8.0)

1.132

(.092)

(.138)

(.140)

(.091)

SE. = 13.8; R2 = .9989; D.W. = 1.96.
Hall reports a positive intercept which must be a typographical error. The

F—statistic for testing the hypothesis that lags 2, 3, and 4 do not enter
the equation is 1.60 which is acceptable. This may not, however, be a very

powerful test if changes in consumption are autocorrelated. If that were
the case we would have:

c—c1 = al(ct_i—ct_Z)
Ct

=

(l+aj)c1

+

+

a2(ct_2—ct_3)

(a2—ai)ct_2

+

3

+

a3(ct_3—ct.4)

(a3—a2)ct3

—

a3ct.4

+

et

÷ et.

Thus the coefficients of c_2 and c_3 may well be small under the
alternative hypothesis and the coefficient of ct_i, ignored in Hall's F—

test, may contain information about autocorrelation in the changes. In

particular, rearranging the coefficients in Hall's regression we
obtain a1 = .13, a2 = .07, a3 = .13 or .125

depending

on how one uses the

four coefficients to solve for the three a's. Estimating the a's directly

I obtained a1 .173, a2 = .104, a3 = .169 with t—ratios of 1.92, 1.13 and

1.86 respectively. The F—statistic is 4.10 which is significant at the
0.01 level.

It would seem then that past changes in consumption do predict future

changes, seemingly contrary to the permanent income hypothesis. Rejection
is assumed, however, because of the linear form arising from the assumption

that utility is quadratic. In Hall's equation, all growth in consumption

is attributed to the constant term involving .

Actual

growth in

consumption is exponential rather than linear. The arithmetic of growth
ensures that the coefficient of past consumption will exceed unity and that

changes in consumption (imposing a unit coefficient) will be positively

autoregressive. The quadratic utility function is valid as a local
approximation with (c—i) reflecting the local value of marginal utility.

In the long run there is no bliss level of consumption and C
time. In effect,

is a missing variable in the Hall regression and lagged

consumption gains additional weight in the regression as its proxy.

3.

Tests Based on a Logaritbaic Utility Function

A more reasonable form of the theory comes out of assuming a
logarithmic utility function for consumption each period. This implies

4

Et(1/c+i) =

[(l+&)/(l+r)](1/ct)

since u'(c) =G/c, Ga constant. The ratio (ct/ct+i) is always positive
aid might reasonably be assumed to be distributed log—normally, in which
case we would have

=

where j.t

is

[(1+8)/(1+r)]

= exp(j.t +

1/2

a2)

the expected value of ln(c/ct+i) and a2 its variance. The

evolution of consumption is then given by

ln(c) =

where

—

ln(c_i)

c. is i.i.d. N(0,a2). Sample values of ji

and a2 in Hall's data are

—.0047 and .36E — 04 respectively, implying

[(l+&)/(1+r)]

.9953

—.0046 + .9953 r.

These estimates satisfy the condition that the rate of time preference is
less than the real interest rate.

The permanent income/life cycle hypothesis predicts that changes in
ln(c) are serially uncorrelated. The sample autocorrelation at lag one is

0.14 with a standard error of 0.09. The sample autocorrelations at lags
two through twelve are all smaller than this and their Q—statistic is only

9.6 which is less than its expected value. In contrast, for the unlogged
data the corresponding statistics are 0.24 at lag one with standard error

0.09 and a Q—statistic of 21.5 which is significant at the 0.05 level.
Regression of the change in ln(c) on the past three changes yields

an F—statistic of 1.2, close to its expected value under the null

5

hypothesis that ln(c) is a random walk. Therefore we have little evidence
that changes in ln(c) can be predicted from past changes.

The logrithmic utility version of the permanent income hypothesis also

implies that the coefficient of ln(ci) is properly taken to be unity. As

mentioned earlier, the least squares coefficient in the regression of a
random walk on its lagged value is biased towards zero and tests based on

standard classical regression theory can be highly misleading. Further,

Evans and Savin (1984) have shown that the distribution of the least
squares coefficient depends on the unknown value of the intercept. A
procedure which does provide an operational test has been developed by

Dickey (1976) and Fuller (1976). The obvious competitor to the unit
coefficient model is one with stationary fluctuations around a trend since
a trend also would account for long term growth. The basic regression is

ln(ct) = .301 +

.960 ln(ct_l) +
(.021)

.231 E_03*TIME +

et.

Although the coefficient of ln(c_i) is about two conventional 'standard

errors' less than unity it is well within the body of the sampling
distribution under the null hypothesis as tabulated by Dickey. Similarly

the 't—ratio' of —1.90 is also well within sampling bounds. Nelson and
Plosser (1982) reported a mean t—ratio of —2.22 in a Monte Carlo study
based on sample size 100.

Since the distribution of the t—ratio was shown

to be insensitive to sample size by Dickey, this can be taken as an
indication that the t—ratio reported above is actually a bit above the

value expected for a random walk. The coefficient and t—ratio are
unchanged (to three decimal places) when one or three lags ofAln(c) are

6

included in the regression to allow for possible autoregression in first
differences.

4.

Do Changes in Income Predict Changes in Consumption?

If consumers adjust fully to information about their future incomes,

past income and income changes should be uncorrelated with the change in

consumption. Hall's test was to regress current consumption on lagged
consumption and lagged income (Hall, 1978, Table 3). Rerunning his first
regression I obtained

Ct

(17.2)

13.8;

SE =

K2 = .9989; DW =

which gives a stronger indication of an influence for lagged income (t
1.63) than the results reported by Hall, presumably due to data revisions.

The effect is nevertheless not significant and it is negative, as Hall
reported.

If

the coefficient of ct_i is close to unity, however, then the

equation describes first differences in consumption and it

imposes a unit coefficient on c1 the F—statistic for the four lags of

income jumps to 3.58 which is significant at the 0.01 level.

This income effect appears tobe largely spurious, however, due to
lagged income proxying for lagged consumption changes. This can be seen

when both lagged income changes and lagged consumption changes are
included:

Note that the t—ratio on Ayt_i is only 1.29 while that for Act_i is 1.62.
Adding two more lags of Ay results in a partial F—statistic for income of

only 0.61 but Act_i has a t—statistic of 1.52.
conclusion

Thus the positive

reached by Hall on the irrelevance of past income is supported

by first difference regressions.

The corresponding regression for logarithms gives quite different
results, however. The estimated relation is

which indicates a significant predictive content for past income (t =

2.5).

As expected, the lagged consumption term is not significant since rates of
change in consumption display little autocorrelation. Adding two more lags
in the income variable we have

Aln(ct) =

+

.003 + .011 Aln(ct_i) ÷ .130 A1n(y_1)

(.046)

SE = .0058; R2 = .0746; DW =

200;

h = N.A.

The partial F—statistics for these additional lagged income terms is only

0.34. Evidently, the predictive value of income is confined to a one

8

quarter lag.

This is further clarified by regression on the

contemporaneous income change and past income changes:

Aln(c) =

+

.003 + .207 Mn(yt) + .130 Aln(y_i)

Myt3) + et

SE = .0053; R2 = .2295; DW =

2.23.

Changes in the log of income display little autocorrelation: —0.03, —0.01,

and 0.04 at lags one through three. Thus the changes are essentially
innovations in the income process which is akin to a random walk. The
response of consumption to the current innovation in income is consistent

with the permanent income hypothesis, but the response to the previous

innovation is not.

The lagged effect of income implies positive

autocorrelation in Aln(c) of about .08 at lag one quarter compared with a
sample value of .14.

The data are averages for each quarter and temporal aggregation can
induce the appearance of lags when in fact there are none in the underlying
relationship defined over some shorter time interval as Tiao and Wei (1976)

have shown. As a rough check on this possibility I collected third—month—

of—quarter data which reduces the degree of temporal aggregation. The
consumption variable is nondurables only, and no adjustment is made for
population, although population contributes very little variation to the
per capita numbers. The monthly data is available only for the second half
of Hall's sample period, starting in 1961. The basic regression result is

reflective of the smaller sample size. Indeed, when two and three lags are
added they are more significant; the partial F—statistic for three lags of
Aln(y) is 2.71 which just misses being significant at the 0.05 level.

5.

Fla'vin's Test and the Mankiw-Shapiro Critique

Flavin (1981) adopts the conventional specification of the permanent
income hypothesis and shows that it implies the conditions tested by Hall.

Permanent income is defined as the annuity value of the individual's
discounted future income and consumption is permanent income plus an error.

Consumption changes only in response to innovations in income because
forecastable movements in income have already been taken into account in
the calculation of permanent income. If the income process is

then consumption responds according to

measures 'excess sensitivity' of Act to Ayt. Flavin shows that the income

process along with the consumption equation constitute a just—identified
structural system which may therefore be estimated in its reduced form

ACt

has been eliminated by substitution.

This formulation makes sense if income is a stationary process, p < 1.

If income is a random walk then Ayt is the innovation Cl,t

and

we have no

way of distinguishing excess sensitivity from appropriate sensitivity

unless somehowwe know8. Flavin, however, imposes stationarity(in the
sense of mean reversion) on the data by removing a fitted trend. The
resulting 'detrended' data will behave like a stationary time series even

if the process generating them is a trendless random walk. In a previous
paper lang and I showed that a detrended random walk will tend to exhibit

cycles which is reflected in an autocorrelation function that is shaped
like a damped sin wave (Nelson and lang, 1981 and 1985). This introduces a

predictability into the detrended data which is purely artifactual. Mankiw

and Shapiro (1984) have pointed out recently that this will result in a
spurious indication of excess sensitivity even if there is none. They show

that in the case where consumption is equal to income detrending leads to
an estimate of 13

equal to one, that is 'complete excess sensitivity.'

More generally, suppose that the income variable we measure is a
random walk so that its first differences are its innovations. Under the

11

permanent income hypothesis, consumption responds to these innovations as

well as to other increments in information. The consumption—income
relation would be

+

Act =

is the accumulation of the c. through time t. For given sample

size the detrending operator is well defined and the same for each
variable, hence we have

ot

where tildes indicate detrended variables. Now the least squares
coefficient it in Flavin's regression is easily shown to be

it =

6(p1—l) +

t—1' —i1

where p1 is the sample autocorrelation of detrended income at lag one. The

second term involves only the sample covariance between errors and income

which are independent by assumption. The value of p1 tends to be about
(1—10/N) for a detrended random walk, which is 0.92 in the case of N121
for Hall's data set. Thus it will tend to be about —.08 & even when there

is no excess sensitivity. Under Flavin's specification this would be
interpreted as 3(p—l) so the effect of detrending is to misinterpret &,

excessively sensitive to income is not clear from this number——it may

reflect an entirely appropriate value of 8 and inappropriate detrending of
the data.

If the random walk specification is correct then p1 and it no longer
has the interpretation of excess sensitivity to the current income change.

It nevertheless is the case that past income should have no predictive

value for Aln(c) if consumption reflects available information. The
regression results without detrending are

Aln(ct) =

1.92. Note that the sign of it has reversed from

negative to positive as a result of not detrending the data, and the
statistical significance is substantially greater. This suggests that the
mean of Aln(c) is not consjant but drifted upward over the sample period.

Summary and Conclusions

Hall

(1978) showed

that the permanent income theory of consumption

implied under certain assumptions that (1)

follows a random walk, and (2)

real consumption per capita

that consumption is not predictable from

past income (or any past information) given prior consumption. Although
Hall found the random walk hypothesis acceptable, a reexamination of the,
data using tests designed to detect serial dependence leads to rejection.

13

This turns out to be due to Hall's choice of a quadratic utility function
which is equivalent to assuming that growth in real consumption is linear.
A logrithmic utility function implies exponential growth and a random walk
in the log of consumption, a hypothesis which is supported by the data.

Past income was reported by Hall to have a negative but insignificant

predictive value for consumption. Changes in the log of income, however,
do have predictive content for changes in the log of consumption and the

correlation is positive. Briefly, the adjustment of consumption to
innovations in income seems to take place over the current and following

quarter. The coefficient on the prior income innovation while
statistically significant is small, about half as large as the response to
the contemporaneous innovation.

The test of the permanent income theory proposed by Flavin (1981) is
formally equivalent to Hall's test, but the coefficient on lagged income is

shown to be a measure of excess sensitivity of consumption to income. This

interpretation depends on income being stationary around a time trend and

Flavin detrends income and consumption prior to testing. Mankiw and
Shapiro (1984) have pointed out that the effect of detrending will be the

spurious appearance of excess sensitivity when the theory is in fact
correct and both series are random walks. The effect of detrending over
Hall's sample period is to produce a negative coefficient on lagged income

which is roughly the size predicted by the Mankiw'-Shapiro analysis given

the contemporaneous sample correlation between changes in the log of
consumption and income. It is therefore not clear from the Flavin test
that consumption is excessively sensitive to income changes.

14

One reaction to finding a lag in the response of consumption to income

is simply that the theory fails. My own is that the theory holds up
remarkably well in view of the severity of its assumptions, its simplicity,

and the quality of the data. Numerous studies suggest that the real rate
of interest is not constant but varies over time. It would be surprising
therefore if the log of consumption were a strict random walk with constant

mean rate of change. The lag in the response of consumption to income is

short, only one quarter. It is not costless for consumers to reassess
their income position and consumption patterns and it would be surprising

if they did so instantaneously or if all did each quarter. Finally, the

quality of the data is not to be taken too seriously. According to
Business Statistics 1982, certain components of personal consumption
expenditures are based on interpolation between benchmark surveys and
annual data. The

effect

of interpolation in general would be to create the

appearance of slower adjustment than what actually occurs.
