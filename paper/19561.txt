ABSTRACT
We study the extent of macroeconomic convergence/divergence among euro area countries. Our analysis
focuses on four variables (unemployment, inflation, relative prices and the current account), and seeks
to uncover the role played by monetary union as a convergence factor by using non-euro developed
economies and the pre-EMU period as control samples

1. Introduction
The creation of the European Monetary Union (EMU) in 1999 was widely
expected to become a catalyst for further economic integration and convergence
within Europe. But the ongoing sovereign debt crisis and, more generally, the
differential macroeconomic performance across euro area members in the
aftermath of the financial crisis have called that prediction into question. It has
even led some commentators to argue that the adoption of a common currency
may have instead been a factor of divergence and, in particular, a source of a
growing gap between a “virtuous core” and a “sinful periphery.” The goal of
the present paper is to assess whether the data supports that view. In particular,
we examine the extent of macroeconomic convergence/divergence among euro
area countries over the 19992012 period, and the role that sharing a common
currency may have played in accounting for that evolution. Our analysis
focuses on the differential performance across countries of labor markets, as
reflected in the unemployment rate, as well as measures of inflation and
competitiveness. The relation between price-competitiveness and current
account imbalances is also explored, paying special attention to the role played
by non price-competitiveness factors. Throughout we treat the performance
during the pre-EMU period, as well as the experience of a number of non-euro
developed economies, as control samples.2
Our main findings can be summarized as follows. The first nine years of EMU
witnessed a strong converge in unemployment rates across euro area countries.
But both the long-term trends and the extent of the short-term comovement of
unemployment rates appear to be shared by other non-euro economies. With
the onset of the financial crisis, however, that convergence process among euro
area countries has been interrupted and largely reversed, more so than in other
non-euro economies.
Secondly, we report strong evidence of convergence towards low inflation rates
over the past quarter century, though that convergence seems unrelated to
monetary union itself since it has been experienced by most advanced
economies. The previous long-term trend notwithstanding, our analysis
uncovers persistent inflation differentials within the euro area during the EMU
period and, as a result, large cumulative changes in relative prices.
Interestingly, though, rather than representing increasingly divergent patterns,
those inflation differentials have implied a substantial convergence in price

Our focus is on macroeconomic convergence. For overview of the impact of EMU on trade and
financial integration see, e.g., Lane (2006), Santos-Silva and Tenreyro (2010), and Kalemli-Ozcan
et al. (2010).

levels, especially in the case of tradable goods. This feature contrasts with the
evidence regarding other developed economies.
Thirdly, we point to the presence of large differences in the evolution of the
current account balance across euro area countries. Perhaps more surprisingly,
those differences seem to display little relation with “narrow” measures of
competitiveness, as represented by relative price levels of tradable goods.
Instead they seem to bear a stronger relation with broader, non-price
competitiveness factors. A possible implication of that finding is that internal
devaluation policies may have limited success in the medium run at reducing
external imbalances unless accompanied by structural reforms that boost some
of those non-price factors.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we analyze the
behavior of the unemployment rate. Section 3 considers the degree of nominal
convergence, as reflected in inflation differentials. Section 4 examines the
evolution of relative prices, distinguishing between tradable and non-tradable
sectors. The relationship between price-competitiveness and the current
account is explored in Section 5 of the paper, which also introduces other nonprice components of competitiveness. The final section summarizes the main
results and concludes.

2. Patterns of Convergence of Unemployment Rates in the Euro
Area
As of April 2013, the unemployment rate in the euro area was holding at 12.1%,
almost five percentage points higher than in March 2008, when it had reached a
record low since the start of EMU. The aggregate unemployment rate, however,
conceals huge differences across countries, as brought out in Figure 1. The
lowest unemployment rates can be observed in Austria (4.8%) and Germany
(5.4%), while the highest are found in Greece (26.9%) and Spain (26.8%). Thus,
the range of unemployment rates is above 20 percentage points. The standard
deviation is 6.6%.

Figure 1. Unemployment Rate in Euro Area Countries (April 2013)

The large dispersion in unemployment rates is likely due to several factors,
including the presence of asymmetric shocks and/or propagation mechanisms,
the limited labor mobility within the euro area and the lack of a fiscal union that
could act as a stabilizing risk-sharing device in the face of country-specific
shocks. Factors of this sort are often viewed as making the euro area fall short of
an optimal currency area.3 In that light, it is useful to contrast the evidence
above with that of the states in the U.S., another large currency union. Thus, in
June 2013, when the U.S. national unemployment rate was 7.6%, the range of
unemployment rates across U.S. states went from 3.1% in North Dakota and
3.9% in South Dakota to 9.6% in Nevada and 9.2% in Illinois, with a standard
deviation of 1.6%. The contrast with the euro area is indeed stark, as reflected in
the histogram in Figure 2.

Mundell (1961) and Kenen (1969) were among the first to emphasize the importance of those
factors in order to determine whether the costs of a currency union (associated to the lack of a
country specific monetary policy) would more than offset the benefits (associated with greater
trade and financial integration).

Figure 2. Distribution of Unemployment Rates across Euro Area Countries (April
2013) and US States (June 2013)

Can the large dispersion in unemployment rates across the euro area be
attributed to the adoption of the single currency and a common monetary
policy? Or has the latter led instead to a more similar labor market
performance? In order to address those questions, we begin by looking at the
evolution of the unemployment rate in eleven euro area countries: Belgium,
Germany, France, Italy, Netherlands, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, Greece, Austria
and Finland. We also report evidence for an aggregate (referred to henceforth as
EA12) comprising the previous countries plus Luxembourg. We compare the
statistics for our set of euro area countries with those of ten other economies,
which we use as a control group. The latter includes the United States, Japan,
Canada, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland, Australia and
New Zealand, as well as the EA12 as a whole. We refer to this group as “other
developed economies.” For both groups of countries (in the present section as
well as for the remainder of the paper) we use annual data spanning the period
1985-2012.
Next we describe some of the patterns of convergence and/or divergence of
unemployment rates found in the data, using a few simple graphs.
Figure 3.a displays the unemployment rate for the group of euro area countries
in selected years: 1985, 1998 (the year before EMU), 2007 (the last year of
expansion), and 2012 (the last year for which we have annual data). The
unemployment rate for the EA12—shown in black in Figure 3.a—does not
5

display a marked trend over the fourteen years preceding the inception of
EMU. But that aggregate pattern masks non-negligible trends in individual
countries: some experience large increases in their unemployment rates (most
noticeably Finland), while others experience large decreases (e.g. Ireland). A
similar “diversity of trends” can be detected for other developed economies in
that period, as shown in Figure 3.b. In both cases, however, the different trends
worked in the direction of strengthening the convergence in unemployment
rates.

Figure 3.b. Unemployment Rate in Other Developed Countries: Selected Years

During the expansionary phase of the EMU period (19992007), we observe a
generalized decline in the unemployment rate of euro area countries (with the
exception of Portugal), accompanied by an apparent reduction in the dispersion
of that variable. This is also the case among other developed economies.
On the other hand, the period that starts in 2007 is associated with a generalized
rise in unemployment. The extent of the rise differs substantially across
countries, as is apparent in Figures 3.a and 3.b. Thus, and compared with 2007,
the unemployment rate in 2012 was 16.7 percentage points higher in Spain, 16.0
in Greece and 10.1 in Ireland. In contrast, it went down 3.2 percentage points in
Germany over the same period. A similar qualitative pattern holds true for the
other advanced economies, though the extent of the dispersion is more limited.
Figure 4.a shows the evolution of the cross-sectional standard deviation of the
unemployment rate, for the two groups of countries separately. We refer to a
reduction in that measure of dispersion for any variable as evidence of “σconvergence.” Note that the dispersion in unemployment rates is higher in the
euro area than in the control group over the entire sample period. Dispersion
declines between 1985 until 2007 both in the euro area and in the control group,
thus pointing to substantial σ-convergence during that period. The decline in
dispersion was not continuous, however: it was reversed during the
recessionary episodes of the early 90s, and more so among euro area countries.
Figure 4.a also suggests that σ-convergence may have been slightly faster for
the euro countries during the EMU years and up to the start of the financial
crisis, though starting from larger dispersion levels. As noted above, during
that expansionary period σ-convergence took largely the form of a decline in
the unemployment rate everywhere (Portugal being the exception), with a
larger decline in countries with a higher initial unemployment rate (Spain being
the prime example of that phenomenon). The dispersion of unemployment
rates across euro area countries has gone up dramatically since 2008, much
more so than for the control group (which also displays a small rise), and it has
attained levels exceeding those prevailing anytime since 1985. It is worth
mentioning that during the recessionary episode of the early 90s, dispersion
increased during three consecutive years (1991-1993), instead of the (at least)
five years registered during the current recession.

Figure 4.a Dispersion of Unemployment Rates

Changes in the dispersion of unemployment rates discussed above are likely to
capture the extent of convergence/divergence in both the structural and cyclical
components of unemployment. In order to isolate the cyclical component and,
hence, assess the evolution of the degree of cyclical synchronization across
countries using that variable, we have also computed the cross-country
dispersion in the first-difference of the unemployment rate. We report the
corresponding time series for both groups of countries in Figure 4.b.
Interestingly, the overall pattern is not too different from that observed in
Figure 4.a (though the sign of the gap is no longer uniform). In particular, the
degree of dispersion appears to increase in recessionary periods, most
dramatically in the case of euro area countries during the most recent crisis
episode. Yet, leaving the latter episode aside, it is hard to see any major
differences across the two groups of countries, both in the levels and the trends
of dispersion, suggesting a limited role of monetary unification in strengthening
the degree of cyclical synchronization, at least as measured by our
unemployment-based indicator. The previous evidence is largely consistent
with recent studies of changes in the degree of cyclical comovement within the
euro area during the EMU years.4

See, e.g., Giannone et al. (2010) and the references therein for evidence on the role of monetary
unification as a potential source of greater synchronization of business cycles.

Figure 4.b Dispersion of Unemployment Rates (First-Differences)

Figures 5 shows a scatterplot of the change in the unemployment rate against its
initial level for three different sample periods, together with the estimates of
regression slopes (separate for each group of countries, shown in different
colors). We use the term “β-convergence” to refer to the existence of a
significant negative relation between the initial levels and subsequent changes
in a variable. The evidence displayed in Figure 5 reinforces some of the findings
discussed above. Thus, in the period before EMU (Figure 5.a) as well as during
the expansionary 1999-2007 period (Figure 5.b), we see evidence of substantial
β-convergence in unemployment rates, both in the euro area and outside. The
rate of convergence is similar, both across periods and across groups, as
reflected in similar slopes. The previous pattern is broken during the 2008-2012
period, for which there is no longer evidence of further β-convergence. In the
case of the euro area this is largely due to Spain and Greece (and to a lesser
extent, Portugal), which have experienced the largest increases in the
unemployment rate, despite having some of the highest levels of that variable
in 2007. 5

Excluding these three countries, the regression coefficient becomes negative, although nonstatistically significant at standard levels.

Overall, the evidence reported in this section suggests that EMU in its initial
design has had no significant impact on the process of convergence of
unemployment rates across euro area countries. That process has been
underway since 1985 for all advanced economies, not only those in the euro
area, being interrupted only by major recessions. Most importantly, EMU has
not prevented a dramatic surge in the dispersion of unemployment rates within
the euro area during the recent crisis. The fact that the increase in dispersion
across euro area countries has been much larger than for non-euro countries is
consistent with the hypothesis that the common currency jointly with the lack
of stabilizing risk-sharing devices may have been a factor behind the large
differences in unemployment performance.

3. Patterns of Convergence of Inflation in the Euro Area
Figure 6 shows the average annual rate of inflation over the 1999-2012 period
for eleven euro area countries (plus the EA12), as measured by the average
percent change in the harmonized index of consumer prices (HICP). Note that
annual HICP inflation for the EA12 over this period is 2%, which coincides with
the upper threshold of the inflation target range set by ECB. Differences across
countries are, however, substantial, with Germany (1.6%) and Greece (3%) at
the opposite ends of the spectrum. The cross-sectional standard deviation is
0.4%.6

The size of inflation differentials across euro area countries during the EMU
years pales when compared with those observed before EMU. In fact, as shown
in Figure 7.a the process of “nominal” convergence across euro area countries
between the mid 1980s and 1998 was substantial. This is also mirrored in the
evolution of the cross-sectional standard deviation, shown in Figure 8, which
displays evidence of strong σ-convergence in the pre-EMU years. But, as shown
in Figures 7.b and 8, that phenomenon was not restricted to euro area countries,
but affected instead most advanced economies. Most likely, thus, it was related
to the widespread adoption of monetary policy frameworks stressing central
bank independence and explicit inflation targets, and to a lesser extent, by the
moderate behavior of commodity prices.7 Of course we cannot know whether
all current euro area countries would have succeeded in adopting credible
monetary policy frameworks consistent with low inflation rates had the
monetary integration process not gone underway.8

Furthermore, and as figures 7 and 8 make clear, the bulk of the inflation
convergence process took place before the birth of EMU.9 Since 1999 inflation
dispersion within the euro area has remained quite stable, whereas the
corresponding measure for other advanced economies has experienced a mild
increase (partly due to deflation in Japan and Switzerland).

The scatterplots in Figure 9 and the corresponding β-convergence regressions
shed some additional light on nominal convergence. Both point clearly to the
existence of strong β-convergence in the period before the advent of EMU,
across all advanced economies and independently of their eventual
membership in the euro area. The rate of convergence across the two groups is
also surprisingly similar. Starting in 1999, however, countries within the euro
area keep experiencing strong β-convergence. This is true both during the
expansion and the crisis periods, though it appears to have been strengthened
in the latter period. This result is reinforced by the fiscal consolidation process
implemented by the euro countries (mostly those affected by the financial
crisis), as it includes important increases in indirect taxation.
On the other hand, β-convergence appears to have come to an end after 1999 for
advanced economies outside the euro area. Yet, as made clear by Figures 9.b
and 9.c, the lack of “reversion to the mean” among the control group is largely
due to Japan and Switzerland, which have been stuck with persistently low or
negative rates of inflation.10
In summary, the evidence in this section suggests that EMU in its initial design
has not been a critical factor behind the convergence of inflation rates observed
among euro area countries. The reason is that the phenomenon of inflation
convergence got underway well before the creation of EMU, and has not been
restricted to euro area countries. Furthermore, the operation of EMU does not
seem to have strengthened or accelerated that convergence, at least in
comparison to other developed economies.

10

Excluding these two countries form the regression, the convergence parameter becomes
negative, although non-statistically significant at standard levels.

Figure 10. Relative Price Levels in Euro Area Countries (2012, EA12=100)

Figures 11.a and 11.b display the evolution of relative price levels for euro area
countries and other developed economies, respectively. In the latter case, price
levels are converted to a common currency (the US dollar). In both cases prices
are measured relative to the EA12, which is normalized to 100 every period.
The evolution of the corresponding dispersion measures is shown in Figure 12.
Overall, the data points to a strong process of σ-convergence within the euro
area. The decline in relative price dispersion starts well before the creation of
EMU and persists during the EMU period, though it appears to stabilize at a
later stage and rise slightly during the recent crisis. On the other hand, the
dispersion of relative price levels for other developed economies does not
appear to display any marked trends, though it shows non-negligible
fluctuations (possibly linked to exchange rate fluctuations). Note also that while
dispersion appears to have been greater among euro area countries than among

16

other developed economies in the mid 1980s, this is no longer the case since the
1990s.11

Figure 12. Dispersion of Relative Price Levels

Figure 13 points to significant β-convergence both before and after the creation
of the euro area and until the onset of the crisis, and for both groups of
countries. Thus, while there is no clear progress in reducing price level
differentials across the non-euro economies, there is evidence of significant βconvergence among those countries, i.e. of some reversion to “average” relative
prices. That tendency appears to have been interrupted during the crisis years,
as illustrated in Figure 13.c.

Figures 14 through 17 present analogous evidence focusing on tradable goods
only. A number of observations are worth stressing.
First, as a comparison of Figures 10 and 14 makes clear, the degree of current
relative price dispersion within the euro area is much smaller for tradables, as
one would expect, with the range between the highest and lowest price levels
being of 26 percentage points, as opposed to 40. In fact, the standard deviation
is 8.3%, 20 percent lower than that of GDP deflator. Perhaps most surprisingly,
the ranking of relative price levels is considerably different than that for all
goods, pointing to a weak cross-country correlation between tradable and nontradable prices.

Secondly, in the case of tradables there is evidence of σ-convergence for both
groups of countries, and not only for those belonging to the euro zone. That
convergence is interrupted and mildly reversed with the advent of the recent
crisis. The evidence pertaining to β-convergence, points to strong convergence
for both groups of countries in the pre-EMU as well as the expansionary part of
the EMU era, but no longer during the recent crisis episode; this behavior is
qualitatively similar to that for all goods and services.

Overall, the evidence suggests that the patterns of evolution of relative price
levels within the euro area have been roughly similar to those observed among
other developed economies. In particular, while the dispersion in tradable
goods prices is substantially smaller within the euro area, progress in terms of
convergence during the EMU years appears to have been stronger among noneuro economies.
5. Patterns of External Imbalances in the Euro Area: The Role of Price
Competitiveness
Real and nominal convergence within the euro area should have led to a greater
convergen ce in the size of external imbalances. In the present section we
explore whether this has been so. Up to now, the answer seems to be negative.
We try to ascertain the role played by price competitiveness as well as other
factors in accounting for the observed divergence.
Figure 18.a summarizes the evolution of current account balances (as a percent
of GDP), in the euro area countries. A few observations are worth stressing.
First, the size of current account (CA) imbalances experienced by euro area
countries was quite moderate in the pre-EMU, though by 1998 three countries
were showing substantial imbalances: Portugal (deficit), and Belgium and
Finland (surpluses). Second, the EMU era includes two very different episodes.
The economic expansion, associated with an important widening of current
account imbalances across euro area countries, much more important than that
of other developed countries. On the contrary, almost all of this increase in
dispersions is reversed between 2007 and 2012 that is the last recession. This
suggests an important cyclical pattern underlying this medium-run dynamics.
By way of contrast, and as shown in Figure 18.b, the dispersion of current
account imbalances among non-euro economies appears to have grown steadily
over the past quarter century, but at a slow rate; there was a substantial
correction right before the crisis, remaining stable afterwards (see Figure 19).
In fact, it seems that the reduction in the current account imbalances occurs
with a certain delay in the euro area relative to the one observed during the
crisis in the developed countries. Most of the adjustment took place in the euro
zone after 2009, two years after that in the other developed countries (see Figure
19). Finally, is worth noting that most of the contribution to the reduction in the
dispersion of the current account imbalances in the euro area is coming from
the reduction of the deficits while the surpluses remain at pre-crisis levels.

24

These patterns extend beyond these euro-one economies. They are present also
in differences between advanced economies (Figure 18.b).

Next we try to explain the evolution of current accounts for both groups of
countries and different periods. Conventional candidate explanatory factors
include measures of “price competitiveness” and of the cyclical position of the
economy. We also explore the role of less conventional non-price measures of
competitiveness.
Table 1 presents cross-country regressions of changes in the current account on
GDP growth (as a measure cyclical position of the economy), as well as two
measures of price competitiveness (the relative price deflator for tradables or
relative unit labor costs in the private sector). Specifically, the table shows the
results of estimating by OLS different cross-section regressions for the average
changes in the current account:
[1]
where
stands for the average change in the current account balance over the
relevant period,
is the average growth rate of GDP in that period and
is the percent change in the competitiveness variable. As before, we
consider three time periods: pre-EMU (19851997); EMU-expanssion
(19982007) and EMU-recession (20082012). The regressions are run
separatedly for the euro area countries and other developed countries.

We discuss some of the main findings. First, for most specifications involving
euro area countries there is a significant negative effect of GDP growth on
current account. That is, economies in recessions tend to “improve” their
current account. That cyclical effect seems to have become stronger during the
EMU years. The regressions using data for other developed countries (see
bottom panel) also point to a negative effect of economic activity, though the
estimated effect is insignificant in all but the pre-EMU specifications.
In the case of euro area countries our estimates also tend to uncover the
anticipated negative link between price competitiveness (measured both using
relative price of tradables and unit labor costs) and the current account: relative
increases in prices tend to be associated with increasing current account

27

deficits.12 The findings for euro area countries described above do not seem to
carry over to our control group of other developed economies: for the latter the
relation between external inmbalances and price competitiveness tends to be
small or insignificant, once cyclical factors are controlled for.
Going back to the euro area countries, we observe the price effects are on the
current account appear to be quantitatively small and weakening over time.
The use of the unit labor costs as the main measure of price competitiveness
seems to improve the fit of the regression, specially during the euro-area
period. Our results seem to support the conclusion that absent any depreciation
in the external value of the euro, the competitiveness problem of some euro
area members arises from the inability of members to devaluate, and the
correction of the external imbalances calls for a process of internal devaluation.13
As we have shown, the level of the relative price of tradable goods does not
seem to be the key determinant of existing external imbalances.
Next we broaden the scope of the previous analysis and look at a larger set of
factors that could explain the evolution of current account imbalances and its
link to competitiveness. What are possible additional dimensions of
competitiveness that one may want to incorporate into our analysis? Below we
explore the explanatory power of the index of competitiveness constructed by
World Economic Forum using a comprehensive set of variables (beyond
relative prices or wages), and usually referred to as the Global Competitiveness
Index (GCI).14 That variable has often been as a tool when thinking about
macroeconomic and institutional elements that are critical to understand the
determinants of competitiveness and more broadly the growth process.15
The GCI is composed of twelve “pillars,” all of which are widely accepted as
being critical to economic growth. Using a combination of publicly available
data and information provided in the Forum’s Executive Opinion Survey—
Lane (2006) emphasizes the differential impact on the competitiveness of different euro area
countries of changes in the external value of the euro, due to the diversity in the composition of
trade partners.
13
Blanchard (2007) constitutes an early analysis on the different options that an euro area
country like Portugal had to recover losses of competitiveness.
14 Several regulation indexes elaborated by the OECD could be used to assess the link between
labor market regulation and good market regulations and external imbalances. The Doing
Business indicators elaborated by the World Bank can be also used for this purpose. As we
discuss below, these aspects constitute key elements of the index elaborated by the World
Economic Forum and some of them are assessed to analyze the robustness of our conclusions.
15 This index was elaborated by Xavier Sala-i-Martin and Elsa Artadi and published by the
World Economic Forum, and it expands on two previously considered indexes: The Growth
Competitiveness Index and Business Competitiveness Index. For more details, see
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Competitiveness_Report.

28

which provides qualitative information on difficult-to-measure concepts—these
pillars are brought together into the index. Hence, the index covers aspects such
as the quality of the macroeconomic environment, the state of a country’s public
and private institutions, the increasing importance of technology in the
development process, a country’s technological readiness, the extent to which
the country has a well-developed transport and communications infrastructure
network, the quality of education as evaluated by the business community as
well as staff’s training as a proxy for skill’s workers. More importantly, the
index also covers goods, labor, and financial markets efficiency and
development.16
As illustrated in the top line of Table 2, the explanatory power of the overall
GCI on current account positions is relatively high, with an R 2 of the crosssectional regression around 0.74 in 2007, while 2012 shows a substantial
reduction in the explanatory power of the indicator. In addition, although the
predictive power of the GCI is no negligible in the case of the group of
developed countries in our group of control, the differences are apparent
relative to the euro area group. Hence, non-price disparities among euro area
play a significantly more important role in explaining current account
imbalances among euro area countries.

Southern European countries display both low levels of broadly defined
competitiveness and large current account deficits. If we give a causal
interpretation to that relation, external adjustment would require continued
gains in competitiveness, beyond the scope provided by further reductions in
wages. To understand how this could be brought about we now turn to the
analysis of which pillar or component of the GCI is driving the strong correlation
between current account imbalances and competitiveness.
Table 2 also shows the R2 of the pairwise cross sectional regressions between
the current account level and each of the components of the GCI. There are four
factors that stand out in terms of their explanatory power for current account
performance: (i) goods markets efficiency, (ii) technological readiness (i.e., the
ability of entrepreneurs to adopt existing technologies to enhance the
productivity of its industries), (iii) business sophistication (i.e., the quality of a
country's business networks and supporting industries), and (iv) innovation
capabilities. Only the three last components explain the bulk of the non-price
contribution to current account imbalances among the developed countries
included in our group of control.
Table 3 tries to introduce some robustness analysis into the previous exercise.
To this end, we ran bivarate regressions of the current account against a series
of qualitative and quantitative indicators that have been developed by variaous
international institutions aiming at capturing similar aspects of the economy
included in the GCI. Factors affecting innovation and R&D effort and
competition in the product market seems to have most of of the explanatory
variables. The World Bank indicators of institutional strengh are also very
relevant, quite in line with the recent findings by the IMF (2013).
The conclusions seem to be clear and robust across most of the qualitative
variables used in our empirical exercises. Our analysis suggests that a
comprehensive strategy aimed at reducing and sustain the large current
account deficits of some of the euro area countries should include, beyond
reduction in wages, structural reforms that help enhance some of the factors
above.

6. Conclusions
We have examined the patterns of convergence and divergence in
unemployment rates, inflation, relative prices and current account balances
among euro area countries over the past quarter century. A number of
observations stand out.
The first nine years of EMU were associated with a strong converge in
unemployment rates across euro area countries, a process that was interrupted
and reversed during the crisis. A similar process has been underway since 1985
for all advanced economies, not only those in the euro area, being interrupted
only by major recessions. However, especially during the last recession the
EMU has not prevented a dramatic surge in the dispersion of unemployment
rates within the euro area. The fact that the increase in dispersion across euro
area countries has been much larger than for non-euro countries is consistent
with the hypothesis that the common currency in its initial design and the lack
of country-specific monetary policies or stabilizing risk-sharing devices to
accommodate country specific shocks may have been a factor behind the large
differences in unemployment performance.
Secondly, and despite the persistence of significant inflation differentials, our
analysis points to a strong convergence of inflation rates among euro area
31

countries. But as in the case of unemployment rate, the evidence suggests that
EMU has not been a critical factor behind that convergence. The reason is that
the phenomenon of inflation convergence got underway well before the
creation of EMU, and has not been restricted to euro area countries.
Furthermore, the operation of EMU does not seem to have strengthened or
accelerated that convergence, at least in comparison to other developed
economies.
Thirdly, rather than generating ever increasing gaps, the pattern of inflation
differentials in euro area countries has been associated with a substantial
convergence in relative price levels, especially in the case of tradable goods.
Finally, we have argued that variations in current account balances across euro
area countries seems to display a small correlation with “narrow” measures of
competitiveness, as represented by relative price levels. Instead, they seem to
bear a stronger relation with broader, non-price competitiveness factors. It
follows that internal devaluation policies may have limited success at reducing
external imbalances in the medium run unless accompanied by structural
reforms that boost some of those non-price factors.

Appendix: Data Sources and Description of the Variables
Most of the data used in this paper has been obtained from the statistical office of the European
Union
(Eurostat),
at
the
web
site:
http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/statistics/themes. In some cases the
time series were forward extended using other data basis, such as AMECO (ECFIN European
Commission):
http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/ameco/user/serie/SelectSerie.cfm
and EU-KLEMS: http://www.euklems.net/.


In particular, the European unemployment rates were obtained from the Labor Force Survey,
using the conventional definitions (population aged 15-64):
http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/employment_unemployment_lfs/d
ata/database.
On its side, the US unemployment rate corresponds to the household data of the Bureau of
Labor Statistics: http://www.bls.gov/news.release/laus.t01.htm.



The European and other countries inflation rates were obtained from AMECO, and they
correspond to the harmonized or domestic concept as available:
http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/statistics/themes.



GDP, value added and their deflators, employment (heads and hours, total employment and
wage earners) and compensation of employees correspond to their National Accounts
definitions. These time series were obtained from Eurostat at the web site:
http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/national_accounts/data/database
In this respect, the tradable sector corresponds to the NACE activities A to E; the nontradable sector to F to E.



The source of the purchasing power parities (PPP) used in the construction of the price levels
is also Eurostat and the International Monetary Fund WEO database:
http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/purchasing_power_parities/data/
database
For the euro area countries, the tradable sector is identified with total goods and the nontradable sector with total services. For other developed countries, relative prices of the
tradable sector in the base year correspond to those of the GDP.
http://www.imf.org/external/ns/cs.aspx?id=28



Information on the current account was also obtained from the balance of payments
compiled by Eurostat and the International Monetary Fund WEO database:
http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/balance_of_payments/data/databa
se
http://www.imf.org/external/ns/cs.aspx?id=28

Unit labor costs are defined as the ratio between wages and labor productivity. Wages are
obtained by dividing compensation of employees on hours worked by employees. Finally, labor

35

productivity corresponds to GDP (Value added) divided on hours worked by total
employment.
The Global Competitiveness Index corresponds to the elaboration of the World Economic Forum:

A brief description of the GCI twelve pillars provided in the main report.
First pillar: Institutions. The institutional environment is determined by the legal and
administrative framework within which individuals, firms, and governments interact to
generate wealth. Government attitudes toward markets and freedoms and the efficiency of its
operations are also very important: excessive bureaucracy and red tape, overregulation,
corruption, dishonesty in dealing with public contracts, lack of transparency and
trustworthiness, inability to provide appropriate services for the business sector, and political
dependence of the judicial system impose significant economic costs to businesses and slow the
process of economic development.
Second pillar: Infrastructure. A well-developed transport and communications infrastructure
network is a prerequisite for the access of less-developed communities to core economic
activities and services. Effective modes of transport-including quality roads, railroads, ports,
and air transport-enable entrepreneurs to get their goods and services to market in a secure and
timely manner and facilitate the movement of workers to the most suitable jobs.
Third pillar: Macroeconomic environment. A proper management of public finances is also critical
to ensuring trust in the national business environment. This pillar includes indicators capturing
the quality of government management of public finances. Running persistent fiscal deficits
limits the government's future ability to react to business cycles and to invest in
competitiveness-enhancing measures. It is important to note that this pillar evaluates the
stability of the macroeconomic environment, so it does not directly take into account the way in
which public accounts are managed by the government.
Fourth pillar: Health and primary education. Poor health leads to significant costs to business, as
sick workers are often absent or operate at lower levels of efficiency. In addition to health, this
pillar takes into account the quantity and quality of the basic education received by the
population.
Fifth pillar: Higher education and training. This pillar measures secondary and tertiary enrollment
rates as well as the quality of education as evaluated by the business community. The extent of
staff training is also taken into consideration because of the importance of vocational and
continuous on-the-job training-which is neglected in many economies-for ensuring a constant
upgrading of workers' skills.
Sixth pillar: Goods market efficiency. Healthy market competition, both domestic and foreign, is
important in driving market efficiency and thus business productivity by ensuring that the
most efficient firms, producing goods demanded by the market, are those that thrive. The best
possible environment for the exchange of goods requires a minimum of impediments to
business activity through government intervention. Market efficiency also depends on demand
conditions such as customer orientation and buyer sophistication. For cultural or historical
reasons, customers may be more demanding in some countries than in others.

36

Seventh pillar: Labor market efficiency. The efficiency and flexibility of the labor market are critical
for ensuring that workers are allocated to their most effective use in the economy and provided
with incentives to give their best effort in their jobs. Efficient labor markets must also ensure a
clear relationship between worker incentives and their efforts to promote meritocracy at the
workplace, and they must provide equity in the business environment between women and
men.
Eighth pillar: Financial market development. An efficient financial sector allocates the resources
saved by a nation's citizens, as well as those entering the economy from abroad, to their most
productive uses. A thorough and proper assessment of risk is therefore a key ingredient of a
sound financial market. In order to fulfill all those functions, the banking sector needs to be
trustworthy and transparent, and-as has been made so clear recently-financial markets need
appropriate regulation to protect investors and other actors in the economy at large.
Ninth pillar: Technological readiness. The technological readiness pillar measures the agility with
which an economy adopts existing technologies to enhance the productivity of its industries,
with specific emphasis on its capacity to fully leverage information and communication
technologies (ICT) in daily activities and production processes for increased efficiency and
enabling innovation for competitiveness.
Tenth pillar: Market size. Therefore we continue to use the size of the national domestic and
foreign market in the Index. Thus exports can be thought of as a substitute for domestic
demand in determining the size of the market for the firms of a country.
Eleventh pillar: Business sophistication. The quality of a country's business networks and
supporting industries, as measured by the quantity and quality of local suppliers and the extent
of their interaction, is important for a variety of reasons. Individual firms' advanced operations
and strategies (branding, marketing, distribution, advanced production processes, and the
production of unique and sophisticated products) spill over into the economy and lead to
sophisticated and modern business processes across the country's business sectors.
Twelfth pillar: Innovation. The final pillar of competitiveness focuses on technological innovation.
In particular, it means sufficient investment in research and development (R&D), especially by
the private sector; the presence of high-quality scientific research institutions that can generate
the basic knowledge needed to build the new technologies; extensive collaboration in research
and technological developments between universities and industry; and the protection of
intellectual property, in addition to high levels of competition and access to venture capital and
financing that are analyzed in other pillars of the Index.
