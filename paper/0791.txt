The OPEC Surplus and US—LDC Trade

ABSTRACT

This paper explores the connections between the shift of world saving
toward OPEC and the changing structure of U.S. trade with the non—oil

developing countries. The basic point of the paper is that during the
l970s, the U.S. economy has become more interdependent through trade with

the newly industrializing countries (NICs) in the developing world. The
shift of world saving toward OPEC in the l97Os effectively internationalized the supply of saving, as OPEC places its surplus in the international

financial system. The NICs and other developing countries borrow the surplus
and direct it to domestic investment. Investment in the NICs stimulates
the demand for U.S. capital goods. The reallocation of resources towards
capital goods production in the U.S. stimulates excess demand for consumer

goods, which appear as imports from the NICs. U.S. exports of capital
goods to these countries have grown rapidly in the 197Os, as have U.S.

imports of non—food, non—auto consumer goods from them. Thus the structure
of U.S. trade has been reoriented to become

complementary with the rapidly—

growing developing countries, and perhaps more competitive with Europe
and Japan.

THE OPEC SURPLUS AND US-LDC TRADE

I.

Introduction and Summary
This paper explores the connections between the shift of world saving

toward OPEC and the changing structure of U.S. trade with the non—oil

developing countries. The basic point of the paper is that during the
1970's, the U.S. economy has become more interdependent through trade
with the newly industrializing countries (NICs) in the developing world.

U.S. exports of capital goods to these countries have grown rapidly, as

have U.S. imports of non—food, non—auto consumer goods. Thus the structure
of U.S. trade has been reoriented to become complementary with the rapidly—

growing developing countries. Formulation of U.S. foreign economic policy
should be sensitive to this change.

The basic facts are presented in tables in the paper. Tables 1 and 2
show the growth of the developing countries in the 1970's, which was not

slowed appreciably by the OECD recession. Table 5 shows the high level of
investment and rapid growth of the NICs, in particular. The extent of borrowing by these countries is well—known, and the numbers are shown in
Tables 3 and 4.

Essentially, the NICs borrowed the OPEC surplus, invested,

and grew. The changing structure of U.S. trade is shown in Tables 6 through
10. In Table 6 we see the shift of U.S. trade toward surpluses in capital
goods and agriculture that approximately finance the deficit on energy.

In Tables 7 and 8 the growth of U.S. exports of capital goods to the de-

veloping countries is shown. From 1975—1980 these grew at an annual rate
of 11.2 percent in real terms. In 1970, 30 percent of U.S. capital goods
exports went to the developing countries; by 1980 the fraction was 42 per-

cent. In Tables 9 and 10 we see a similar development of U.S. imports of

2.

non—food, non—auto consumer goods.

The paper interprets these changes as follows. The shift of world
saving toward OPEC effectively internationalized the supply of saving,
as OPEC places its surplus in the international financial system. The

ICs and other developing countries borrow the surplus and direct it to
domestic investment. Investment in the NICs stimulates the demand for

U.S. capital goods. The reallocation of resources towards capital goods
production in the U.S. stimulates excess demand for consumer goods, which

appear as imports. Thus the resource shifts as the U.S. make its economy
more complementary to the developing countries, and perhaps more conpetitive
with Europe and Japan.

The structure of the paper is as follows. In section II we briefly
review models of interdependence, and argue that the channel that allocates
world saving to local investment is increasing in importance.

In section

III we show the pattern of borrowing, investment, and growth in developing

countries. Then in section IV we discuss the changing structure of U.S.
trade. The numbers give the impression of an economy in the process of resource reallocation toward its comparative advantage in a world of interaction between financial flows and trade.

3.

II. Models of Macroeconomic Interpndence
A basic argument of this paper is that the rise of OPEC as a supplier
of world saving has made growth in developing countries less dependent on

the OLCD countries. In this section we will sketch the basic theoretical
framework for studying interdependence between the OECD (and U.S.) and the

developing countries (DCs). We will focus here on "macro—level" interdependence, to draw a distinction with "structural interdependence" between
the U.S. and the DCs, which is discussed below in section IV.

By interdependence at the macro level we mean interdependence of
aggregate variables such as GNP or the price level between countries
or regions.

At this level, interdependence can work through many channels.

Movements in demand in one country can spill over into demand for another's
exports, and this in turn can feed back into the country originating the

disturbance. There are in the economics literature models with various
levels of complexity that focus on trade as a channel of interdependence.

Examples are found in Robinson (1952) and Branson—Rotemberg (1980). We
will call these "demand side" links.

Another family of economic models focuses on the world allocation

of saving and investment through international capital markets. In the
extreme version of this model, with "perfect" capital mobility, all saving
flows into a world pool, and is then allocated to national investment

according to relative expected real rates of return. In this model an
increase in saving in the U.S. would show up as an increase in investment
in the developing countries, but increased investment in the U.S. would

draw capital away from the developing countries. We will call this the
"supply—side" link; a good recent paper giving a sophisticated version

4.

is Lipton—Sachs (1980). The rise of OPEC as a world investor with capital
seeking a high and safe return has increased the relevance of this model
in the l97Os.
A.

Demand-side Links
_______________
To illustrate the variety and complexity of interdependence through

demand—side links, we will summarize three fairly simple models that analyze

interactions between two countries. The first is a one—commodity purchasing—power—parity model, taken from Branson—Rotemberg (1980). The second is
the two—commodity fixed—price model of Robinson (1952).

The last is the

two—commodity model with flexible prices of B,ranson—Rotemberg (1980). Even

in this overly simplified model the complexities are apparent: it is quite

possible that an increase in demand in one area reduces putput in the

other
1.

One commodity with rigid wages
We begin by describing the simplest macro model that yields interesting

results for the effects of demand policy. We will just outline the argument
and summarize a results here. Technical details are presented in Branson—
Rotemberg (1980).

Think of a world of two countries, each producing the same good

(the "schmoo"). Trade is free, so if the price of the good in the tiforeigni?

ar fixed by custom or contract in the short run. Finally, let us make

th standard assption that employers viii expand output and empioent
if their output price rises relative to the wage rate.

Consider now what happens if demand is expanded, by monetary or

fiscal policy in Western Europe. This pulls up wages and prices there,
with no effect on output or employment, demand expansion is purely in-

flationary. But what happens in the United States? The expansion in
demand in Western Europe spills over into demand for U.S. exports. As
U.S. prices rise relative to wage rates, output and employment rise.
Thus this demand stimulus in Western Europe is purely inflationary there.

It reduces the European trade surplus and the U.S. trade deficit. Finally, the expansion in Europe increases output and employment in the

U.S. It is easy to see why the U.S. argued for demand stimulus in Europe
in 1976 and the Europeans resisted.
If, however, money wages were sticky in Europe as well as the U.S.,

the result would be different. The demand stimulus in Europe would raise
prices, output, and employment in both Europe and the U.S. The European
trade surplus and the U.S. deficit would be reduced. This is the model
the U.S. side of the 1976—78 discussion probably had in mind. Branson—
Rotemberg (1980) argue that it is not appropriate for most of Europe,
and Japan, where real wage rates tend to be more sticky.
What is the effect of growth in the developing countries in this

model? If growth rates increast autonomously in the developing world
(due, perhaps, to an improvement in policy or efficiency), demand for the

6.

exports of both the U.S. and Europe will increase. In Europe, with real

wage rigidity, this will increase the trade surplus and inflation, but

not employment or output. In the U.S., with sticky money wages, employ—
ment and output will rise, as well.

2.

Two commodities with rigid prices
Another model giving the same general and clear—cut result that a demand

expansion in one country raises output in the others through the trade channel is the two—country multiplier model of Romney Robinson (1952). In Robin—
son's framework, each country produces a different good, or bundle of goods,

but movements of relative prices are suppressed in the analysis, to focus on
the Keynesian demand—side multiplier mechanism.
In the Robinson model, each country's imports from the other depends on

its own level of output (and income). Each country's exports are the other's

imports. what is the effect of a policy—induced demand expansion in this
model? Suppose demand is stimulated by fiscal or monetary policy in Europe.
This increases income in Europe by a Keynesian

The Robinson model yields clear—cut results for interdependence by

assuming fixed prices. In that case the international trade feedbacks

add

to the standard Keynesian multipliers. However, the assumption of fixed

argue

that this may be an im-

portant element in the relations between the U.S. and the rest of the major
OECD countries (Europe and Japan).

We can see how this possibility arises just by studying labor supply

and demand in one country. Consider a situation in which each of two countries
specializes in production of one good, and they trade. The relevant price
level for producers on the demand side of the labor market is the price of

the home good P. However, workers consume both goods, the home good with

price P, and the import with price P. The relevant price level for labor
supply decisions is the CPI, which is weighted average of P and P. Thus
the demand for labor depends on P,; as P rises the demand for labor increases.

The supply of labor is responsive to both P and P. When either rises, the
supply curve shifts up as workers demand higher wages. Equilibrium employment in this situation is shown no N0 in Figure 2.

Now consider what happens when demand rises abroad, pulling up P

This increases the CPI, and reduces the real wage labor receives. This
"terms of trade effect" shifts the labor supply function in Figure 2 up,

reducing employment and output at home. Thus it is possible that the demand
expansion in one country reduces output in the other through the terms—of-

trade effect. This theoretical possibility was noted by Argy and Salop
(1979) and Sachs (1979), and Branson—Rotemberg (1980) argue that it may be
a reasonable characterization of reaction in western Europe and Japan to expansion in the U.S.
The relevance of these results for interdependence between the U.S.

and developing countries results from consideration of the US—Europe—Japan

relationship. Assume for a moment that most developing countries and the
U.S. have sticky money wages, but that Europe and Japan follow the model of

Figure 2. Then an expansion of demand in the U.S. could reduce output in
Europe and Japan. The total effect on demand for the output of the developing countries would be unclear; it would depend on the weights of the U.S.

vs Europe and Japan on their exports. Similarly, the effect of an expansion
in demand in the developing countries on the U.S. would be unclear. The con—
tractionary result in Europe could outweigh the expansionary effect from the
developing countries.

These complexities and ambiguities arise in the simplest of models when

we consider carefully supply—side effects. Their empirical importance and relevance for policy are not clear now; research in this area is only beginning.—'
But at least this tells us to beware of

reliance on simple demand—side

multiplier models of trade interaction.

countries, using a few examples of potentiallY

13.

(a) Increase in U.S. saving.
A policy that increases the U.S. saving ratio would increase the
world saving pool, and increase investment in developing countries
and in the U.S. by their marginal shares of the pool.

(b) Increase in U.S. investment.
An increase in U.S. investment could be achieved by increasing
the U.S. real rate of return, perhaps through tax incentives.

Through the world saving—investment channel, this would increase
investment in the U.S. and reduce investment in the developing

countries, holding world saving constant. Of course, through
the demand—side links this might be offset by an expansion of

income and saving in the U.S., which could also offset the effect through the saving—investment channel, but only partially.

(c) Increase in developing country productivity.
This is the effect studied in detail by Lipton—Sachs (1980) in
their more sophisticated model of the world saving—investment

mechanism. An increase in the real rate of return in developing
countries will shift the allocation of saving toward investment
in the developing countries, and away from investment in the
U.S.

(d) Shift in world distribution of income.
The increase in the real price of oil shifted the world distribution of income from the U.S. and developing countries and

toward the oil—exporters. If we assume that the latter's

14.

saving rate exceeds those of the importers, which seems to be

the case, this will increase the world saving rate. Investment in the developing countries will then rise by their mar-

ginal share of the world saving pooi. This seems to have been
an important effect in the 197Os, as developing countries maintained investment and growth rates by borrowing in the euro—

markets while the OECD world went into stagnation. We will review this evidence more thoroughly in Section III below.
In addition to the simple effect of an increase in world saving,

the shift of the locus of saving toward OPEC probably increased the importance of the supply—side link by increasing the international mobility
of capital. The OPEC surplus tends to go to the Eurouiarkets which are
major suppliers of funds to the developing countries.

In a sense, the

shift toward OPEC has increased the degree to which saving and investment

are internationalized. This has weakened the dependence of developing
countries on bilateral links and OECD growth.

Each of the examples (a) —

(d) discussed the effect of a single shift

in saving or investment. One could combine these to analyze the effects
of simultaneous shifts. In general, the results of combinations of events
in one area for growth in other areas of the world will depend on the
originating area's net draw on the world saving pool.

If a change in

tax policy in the U.S. increases saving and investment, U.S. growth

will increase. If saving rises more than investment, the world saving

15.

pool will increase, on balance, and investment will rise in the de-

veloping countries. If an increase in efficiency in the developing
countries raises their saving and investment, their growth rates will

rise. The result for U.S. investment and growth will depend on whether
saving increased more than investment in the developing countries. Thus
an event can, in general, benefit all if it raises saving more than investment locally, adding to the world saving pool on balance.
III. Empirical Evidence from the 1970s

The demand—side mode? of section Il—A would lead us to expect that
growth in GNP in developing countries would be closely tied to growth in the

industrial countries. The supply—side model of section lI—B would shift
the focus of interdependence toward the international capital markets. It
would suggest more independence of developing country growth rates from
those of industrial countries, and more dependence in international saving

flows. Here we review the evidence from the 1970s, and conclude that a
shift toward thinking along the lines of the supply—side model is appropriate
for the 1980s.
A.

Real Growth Rates and Terms of Trade
Table 1 presents a sununary of global growth rates for the period

1950—77. In the data on GNP per capita, we see industrialized countries'
growth rising from 2.5 percent per year in the decade 1950-60 to 4 percent

in 1960—70, and then falling back to 2.4 percent in 1970—77. The low—
income developing countries follow a roughly similar pattern, although
their pattern within the 1960—70 decade was quite different from that of

the industrialized countries. It is interesting to note that the 1950—60
and 1970—77 relation between the growth rates of these two areas rates
is identical.

model. However, the behavior of the low—income countries seems
relatively more consistent with the demand—side model.

B.

External Borrowing

The data on external borrowing by developing countries in the 1970s
support this conclusion. Over the period since 1973, the cumulative deficit

of the DCs has approximately equalled the cumulative surplus of OPEC. The

data are shown in Table 3, borrowed from Cohn Bradford (1981). The cumulative OPEC surplus is $453.8 billion, and the cumulative DC deficit is

$415.9 billion. Thus in effect, the developing countries borrowed the
OPEC surplus.

Details for borrowing by the newly industrializing countries (NICs)
among the developing countries (DC—NICs), and a group of countries identified by Bradford (1981) as "next tier" NICs are shown in Table 4.

There we show external public debt in billions of dollars and as a percent of GNP, and the debt—service ratio, in 1970 and 1978 (end of year)
for low—income and middle income countries.

Among the 38 countries listed by the World Bank as "low—income,"
India, Pakistan, and Indonesia were by far the major international debtors

in 1979. Their total of $37 billion in 197 was about 63% of the aggregate
$57 billion for low—income countries; the next largest low—income debtor
in 1979 was Zaire, with $3.8 billion.

In 1970, India, Pakistan, and Indonesia together owed $13.4 billion
Out of an aggregate of approximately $17 billion for the low—income countries.
Thus during the l970s, among the low—income countries the debt of these
"big three" increased from $13.4 to $37 billion; the debt of the rest of

the 38 countries increased from about $3.6 billion to $19 billion. While
India, Pakistan, and Indonesia remained the major borrowers, intexnatinal
debt finance showed a significant increase among the rest of the low—
income group.

The really major borrowers in the 1970s were, however, the 52

countries listed by the World Bank as "middle—income." Their total
external public debt was approximately $250 billion at the end of 1979.

These countries all show major debt expansion in the 1970s as they
borrowed to finance investment and growth.

C.

Investment and Growth

The data on investment and real GDP growth in the NICs and record—
tier NICs,
and

gross

are

summarized in Table 5. We show growth rates of real GD?

domestic investment for the decades 1960—70 and 1970—79.—'

Investment as a percentage of GD? is shown in the last two columns for
1960 and 1979.

In more than half the countries in Table 5, the growth rates of real

CDP and real investment rose in the 1970s relative to the 1960s. In almost
all cases, the growth rate of investment was larger than that of GD? in

the 1970s. And in all cases the investment — GD? ratio was larger in 1979
than in 1960, usually showing a big increase.

The data thus show a substantial rise in investment in the NICs and
next—tier countries in Table 5, financed by the increase in borrowing

shown in Table 4. These coUntries borrowed the OPEC surplus and invested
it. The result was a maintenance or increase in growth in the l970s in
the face of the OECD slowdown.

/Note that Taiwan is not in Table 5 since it no longer appears in
World Development Report tables.

IV. Structural Interdepefldefl!Betyrt

the U.S.

During the 1970s the US and the developing economies, especially
those which are rapidly—growing and jdustrialiZiflg, have

developed another type of interdependence,

which we will call

'structural interdependence.' This is the type of interdependence
contetplated by classical or neo—classiCal

econies specialize along lines of
tion, and

then

trade theory, in which

cnparatiVe advantage in produc-

trade with each other to obtain a diversified consump-

are final goods, so
tion bundle. in standard trade theory, all goods
complementarities are achieved by specialization in production of
final goods.
Iii U.S. trade, however, there is an

increasing trend toward

specialization iii production of capital goods, chemicals, and agri-

cultural product, in exchange for imports of fuel, autos, and cori

sumer goods. These trends are documented in Branson (1980). A
suzunary is provided in subsection A below.

In its trade with developing countries,
growing exports

of

the U.S. has rapidly

capital goods and imports of consutnei goods. As

the developing countries industrialize, they import U.S. capital

goods. In 1980 the U.S. surplus on trade in capital goods reached
approximatelY $45 billion. In exchange, the U.S. imports final

consumer goods. This is an example of comparative advantage at work,
making the two sets of econcxnies structurally cczipletnefltarY, or

interdependent. The result is increasing efficiency, in general, but
if the process moves too quickly it can generate significant adjust

ment costs.

26.

In subsect{on B below we look at the growth in capital goods
exports to developing countries, and in subsection C we look at U.S.

consumer goods imports. Section D summarizes.

27.

A.

The Composition of U.S. Trade

At the end of World War II, the pattern of U.S. trade was distorted
by the fact that industrial capacity had been significantly reduced in

the other major advanced countries. Trade in consumcr goods provides a
good example of this distortion. In every year from 1925 to 1938 the

U.S. was a net importer of consumer goods. But in 1946 the U.S. emerged
from the war as a net exporter, and in 197 the surplus on consumer

goods was $1 billion. As industrial capacity was rebuilt in Europe and

Japan, the surplus sbrank teai1v, and in 1959 the U.S. aain bec&me a
ret importer, with a deficit in consumer goods that has grom steadil':

since then. This example is typical of the pattern we see in the
long—run data on the composition of trade. During the years since 1950
the composition of U.S. trade has moved back toward its longer—run base

of comparative advantage. By the mid—l960s we see growing surpluses in
trade in capital goods, chemicals, and agriculture, and deficits in con-

sumer goods and non-agricultural industrial supplies and materials. Trade
in automotive products switched from surplus to deficit in 1968.

The

evolution of the composition of U.S. trade is discussed in detail in
Branson (1980).

The U.S. trade position in 1980 is an extension of the trends

detailed there; it is summarized in Table 6. There we show

U.. trade in 1979 and 1980, by major end—use categories. The
patterns of surpluses and deficits are instructive.

The surpluses in capital goods and chemicals have grown since the

period just after World War II. These are clear areas of comparative
advantage. The deficit on consumer goods we already have discussed;

that on autos has existed since 1968. The deficit on petroleum is ob—
vious, and the agricultural surplus became a major element also around
1974.

If we aggregate the data slightly differently, we see more clearly

the post—1974 adjustment in U.S. trade. In 1979, the deficit on trade
in petroleum of $58 billion was substantially offset by surpluses of
$18 billion in agriculture and $16 billion in non—petroleum manufac-

tures, leaving a net trade deficit of $24 billion. In 1980, the petroleum deficit was $76 billion, but the agricultural surplus was $24 billion
and the manufactures surplus was $30 billion, leaving a net deficit of
$22 billion.

Thus the petrpleum deficit is largely offset by surpluses in agriculture and manufacturing. Within maiiufacturing there is a clear division

by comparative advantage, with a very large and gro'ing surplus in capital
goods and smaller but significant deficits on consumer goods and autos

and a surplus in chemicals. In its trade in manufactured goods the U.S.
is becoming increasingly specialized alorg lines of comparative advantage.

30.

The U.S. economy has responded to the oil price

increase, which is

generating a $76 billion deficit by 1980, by expanding its trade surpluses along its lines of comparative advantage.

The degree of adjust-

ment is indeed quite remarkable; by 1980 the total trade deficit was

$22 billion. The movement in the real exchange rate helped, improving
the U.S. competitive position. Thus it appears that adjustment has
worked well in the U.S.

31.

B. U.S. Exports of Capital Goods to Developing Countries
A striking development in U.S. trade in the 1970s was the
acceleration of growth in capital goods exports and the surplus in
trade in capital goods, which was nearly $45 billion by 1980.

During

the mid—1970s there was a quantum jump in U.S. exports of capital
goods to oil exlxrters and to industrializing developing countries

rFranson (19O), p. 220]. Growth in capital goods exports to these
countries continues to increase, and should provide an area of

strength for U.S. trade on the 1980s. Rapid growth in manufacturing
capacity in the developing countries is clearly good for the exercise

of U.S. ccparative advantage in capital goods exports.

Table 7 presents data on U.S. exports of capital goods, in

constant 1979 dollars. Table 8 presents the growth rate summary of
the data in Table 7.

In Table 7 we see rapid growth in spurts through-

out the period since 1965. The period 1965—72

saw fairly steady growth

from $13.6 billion to $24 billion (1979 dollars). Then there was a jump
in three years to $43.5 billion in 1975, a pause to 1977, and then another jump to $67.2 billion in 1980.

The data for exports to the developing countries show

differing

patterns of growth in the l970s. To Latin America we see a doubling
of exports in 1972—75, a pause,and another jump in 1977—80. The major

period of growth in exports to the Near East ended in 1976. The
growth in South Asia has been irregular, with a surge in 1976—80.

Southeast Asia resembles Latin America, with the jump in 1972—75, a
pause, and another jump in 1977—80. A peak in Africa was reached

in 1976, with a jump in 1980. The general impression is that exports of
capital goods to the Near East and Africa follow jumps in the oil price,

and that exports to Latin Pnerica and South and Southeast Asia are tied

to growth in manufacturing output in those areas. In 1970, exports to
the developing areas shown in Table 7 were 30 percent of total capital
goods exports; in 1973 this share was 32 percent, and by 1980 it was up
to 42 percent.

Table 8 gives the growth rate summary for total capital goods.

Let us focus on the period 1973—80. During this period U.S. real GNP
grew at an annual rate of 2.4 percent. In Table 8 we see that total capital

goods exports grew at 11.2 percent, substantially faster than total

real demand. Since the share of exports to developing countries was
rising over the period, they were growing faster yet.

As we run across

the columns in Table 8 for 1973—80, we see that exports of capital goods
to each developing—country area except Africa grew faster than the total.
Thus in the 1970s growth in capital goods exports was much faster than
growth in total U.S. demand, and the share of the developing countries
as a market for capital goods exports grew.

Growth in manufacturing

capacity in the developing countries, based significantly on international
borrowing, appeared as demand for exports of capital goods in the U.S.

35.

C. U.S. Imports of Consumer Goods from Developing Countries
U.S. imports of non—automotive consumer goods have also grown

increasingly rapidly in the l970s. By 1980 the overall deficit in
trade in this category was $18 billion, small in cnparison to the
capital goods surplus, but still significant. U.S. imports from
developing countries grew from 25 percent of total non—automotive

consumer goods imports in 1970 to 52 percent in 1980. Thus as U.S.

imports of consumer goods fr developing countries grew in the
l970s, U.S. exports to them provided the basis for expanding these

consumer good industries. To some extent, the growth of consumer
goods imports in the U.S. released resources to provide for the

expansion of capital goods exports. The U.S. economy became
increasingly interdependent with the economies of the developing
countries through this pattern of growth in trade.

Table 9 presents the data in U.S. imports of non—automotive
consumer goods, in constant 1979 dollars, and Table 10 gIves the
growth rate suixary of the data in Table 9.

In Table 9 we see fairly steady growth in total imports of
non—automotive consumer goods except the recession year of 1975 and

the growth recession that began in 1979. In the data for imports
from Latin America we see a quadrupling from 1970—74, a drop in 1975

and more gradual growth since. Imports from the Near East and South
Asia slxw steadier growth paths, with South Asia the steeper. Im—
ports from Southeast Asia doubled from 1970—74, paused in 1975, and

then doubled again to 1980. Imports from Africa increased six—fold

over the period 1970—80. The share of the LDCs in total U.S. imports
of non—automotive consumer goods ran from

25 percent in 1970 to 33

billion
percent in 1973 and 52 percent in 1980. Their total of $16.3
in 1980 was much less than U.S. exports of capital goods to them ——

$28 billion in 1980.
The growth rate summary of Table 10 shows U.S. total imports of

non—automotive consumer goods growing at an annual rate of 6 percent
1973—80, again faster than total real demand. Imports from each
developing country area grew substantially

faster, as their share

increased. Thus as manufacturing capacity grew in the developing
countries in the 1970s, their output found a

market in the U.S.

D. Sumrny

In

its trade with developing countries in the l970s, the U.S.

has become increasingly complementary

and specialized. The overall

composition of U.S. trade, reviewed in subsection A, has moved increasingly toward export surpluses in capital goods, agricultural
and
goods, and chemicals, with deficits in autos, consumer goods,

fuels. By 1980, the U.S. had surpluses on the order of $25—30 billion
on manufactured goods and agriculture.

39.

In its trade with the developing countries, the U.S. Is increasingly an exporter of capital goods and an importer of consumer goods,

with a surplus on this exchange of about $26 billion in 1980. This
fits well with basic notions of comparative advantage, and it
reflects an efficient re—allocation of resources in the U.S.

This increase in structural interdependence with the developing
countries also fits nicely into the picture of interdependence at the

macro level. As the industrializing developing countries borrow internationally to finance growth, they buy capital goods from the U.S.
In turn their manufactured consumer goods find a market in the U.S.

The picture of interdependence through capital markets and through
industrial structure is consistent and probably efficient in the long
run.
