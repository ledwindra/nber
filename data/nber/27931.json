    "abstract": "\n\nWe propose a tractable model of dynamic investment, spino\ufb00s, \ufb01nancing, and risk management for a multi-division \ufb01rm facing costly external \ufb01nance. Our main results are: (1) within-\ufb01rm resource allocation is based not only on the divisions\u2019 productivity\u2014as in \u201cwinner picking\u201d models\u2014but also their risk; (2) \ufb01rms may voluntarily spin o\ufb00 productive divisions to increase liquidity; (3) diversi\ufb01cation can reduce \ufb01rm value in low-liquidity states; (4) corporate socialism makes liquidity less valuable; (5) division investment is determined by the ratio between marginal q and marginal value of cash. We further generalize our model to account for capital redeployability, M&As, and managerial entrenchment.\n\n",
