NBER remains a popular informal forecasting tool in spite of the original

criticism that its use represents "measurement without theory." This
paper seeks to evaluate the performance of the index in comparison to
alternative

time series methods in predicting business cycle behavior.

Introduction
If the success of a specific approach to economic analysis can be measured

by its longevity and continued use under a variety of environments, then the
use of the index of leading economic indicators, originally developed by researchers at the National Bureau of Economic Research (see Burns and Mitchell
1946 and Moore 1961) and now published by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis

for prognostication about the business cycle, must stand near the top (one might

say peak) of the list of such successes. This is rather remarkable in light of
the criticism under which it has been since Koopmans (1947) first decried the

lack of any theory behind the NBER business cycle methodology. The use of
leading indicators survived through the period of advancement and demise of the
structural approach to econometric forecasting and, if anything, has enjoyed a
resurgence in recent years as more sophisticated time series techniques of
"weasurement without theoryT' have been developed. In fact, the relationship

between the leading indicator approach and general time series methods of the
type described by Box and Jenkins (1970) was formalized by Sargent and Sims
(1977), who pointed out that forecasting with a composite index may be seen as
the imposition of a specific set of restrictions on the vector autoregression
containing the individual series included in the index.

From this standpoint, it is possible to evaluate the index of leading indicators as a tool for prediction, and such is the purpose of this paper.

There are a number of questions to be answered. Among them are:

(1) Is the

index

of leading indicators of significant value in the

prediction of cyclical variables?

(2) Is the method used currently to construct the index optimal, in
a statistical sense?

—2—

(3) Would a second index composed of the same individual series help
further in predicting cyclical variables?

In short, can a logical justification be found for the continued popularity of
the leading indicator approach, or should its appeal, like that of astrology,

be ascribed to the desire for simple answers to questions for which no answers
exist.

II. Methodology
One of the problems that existed until recently was that there was no

objective way to evaluate the index of leading indicators. Much time was spent
"scoring" the index and its component series in terms of how well they predicted

business cycle turning points, but here arose the difficulty in determining

just what these series were predicting. The common approach was to say that
three successive drops in the monthly index signalled a turning point, but when

was the turning point so predicted supposed to occur? Indeed, as Neftci (1978)
has suggested, the whole emphasis on turning points, as opposed to behavior
throughout the cycle, suggests the implicit view that the "model" which under-

lies the economy undergoes a discrete change when turning point occur. As this
assumption seems rather restrictive and because of the difficulty in even defining a turning point, our analysis will use ordinary time series estimation
techniques.

In general, we will be estimating regressions of the form

number of periods (months) ihead the prediction is being made. In various
situations, x will either be set equal to the BEA composite index of twelve
leading indicators, or chosen simultaneously with the estimation in (1) as a

way of finding the optimal composition of the index using the same twelve

series. We make no attempt to identify other series not included in the
twelve which might provide additional help in predicting y.

Assuming y and x to be stationary time series, we may then apply the
causality test of Granger (1969) to determine whether x "causes" y or, equivalently, whether the leading indicator is significant, in a statistical sense,
in forecasting cyclical behavior.

By allowing the joint, maximum likelihood

determination of the vector of coefficients, , and the weights w, of the
twelve series making up the index x, we may determine how good the present

method for choosing weights is. We may also test whether these weights should
be the same for different lags, or whether some series are good for "near"

prediction and others better for "far" prediction. An important general issue
is whether various versions of equation (1) are stable over different sample

periods, and how out of sample prediction compares to within sample fit. The
well—known "Lucas critique" of prediction using estimates of structural models

applies in principle to time series prediction as well. As long as relationshIps between independent and dependent variables are not invariant with re-

spect to policy, within sample fits may be misleading. One argument in favor
of the use of leading indicators in this context might be that the relation-

ships estimated are of a more fundamental nature and hence less subject to

instability due to policy changes. For example, one of the twelve series in—

months hence, it is hard to imagine any realistic government policy that could

alter the relationship. While this type of relationship is difficult to posit
for many of the other twelve series, it is conceivable that a useful purpose
for the composite index could be found in prediction during an unstable policy
environment.

Before turning to the actual estimation results, we describe briefly in
the next section the data and methodology used by the BEA

in

its calculation

of the index of leading indicators.

III. Data: Individual Series and the Composite Index
The selection of leading indicators was begun by Wesley Mitchell and

Arthur Burns at the NBER in the l930s. Since then, periodic reviews have been
made with each new business cycle of the value of various individual series as
predictors of general economic performance and the composition and weights of
the most frequently cited of these series, the index of leading indicators, have

been adjusted. The most recent revision was done in March 1979, when, at the
time of introduction of the new money stock classifications, the obsolete Ml

was dropped from the index and M2 was substituted in its place, with all twelve

series having their respective weights adjusted. However, for two reasons, we
shall work with the index as it existed until this last revision. First,
several series, including the money stock, have been revised in such a way that:
comparison with corresponding series from earlier periods is difficult.

Second,

there has not been enough time since this revision to measure fairly the new

index's out of sample performance. It would not be appropriate to truncate
the estimation period at, say, the end of 1973 when we know that the chief
reason for the substitution of M2 for Ml in the index is the erratic performance
of Ml over recent years.

—5-.

We thus rely on the series and corresponding version of the index devel-

oped most recently before 1979. As described in Zarnowjtz and Boschan (1975),
the twelve series and their weights were determined after

evaluating the per-

formance of many series over the period 1948—1970 with respect to the following
six criteria:

(1) Economic significance
(2) Statistical adequacy (in describing the economic process in question)
(3) Timing at revivals and recessions
(4) Conformity to historical business cycles

(5) Smoothness
(6) Currency or timeliness (how promptly the statistics are available)
The series were given overall scores, and twelve with high scores chosen for
the index, with an intentional inclusion of some series outside the "top twelve"

for the purpose of diversified economic coverage. The twelve included series

were then weighted by their scores in computing the overall index. Descriptions of these series and their weights are presented in Table 1. The weights
are applied to percent changes1 of the individual series, after these changes
have been "standardized" by dividing by their mean absolute values over the
period 1948-.1975.2 The resulting number is the percent change in the composite

leading indicator. In the final step used to calculate the indicator actually
reported, these changes are themselves standardized to make them have the same
hn L

volatility as changes in the composite index of coincident indicators, and
flc!

then cumulated to form the leading indicator index itself. For our purposes,
the unstandardized composite changes will be sufficient.

Because the series weights vary so little (from .930 to 1.079), the index
is basically the unweighted sum of the standardized versions of the original

series. It is a little surprising that so much effort is expended in updating

series scores to recalculate the weights,

as is done frequently, given that the

weights never vary significantly from this pattern. It is hard to imagine that
the series would behave

very differently if equal weights were assigned. In

fact, calculating the changes in the

duces a time series that, for the sample period used in this paper, has a correlation with the actual series of

changes in the composite index which is

indistinguishable from 1.0 to at least three decimal

places. Thus, whatever

merit there is in using a composite index to smooth out fluctuations in individual series, the mechanism used to choose

seemingly complicated procedure and just

adding up the series.

The series which we will attempt to predict are the Federal Reserve Board's
Index of Industrial Production (JQ) and the unemployment rate for men and women

over sixteen (RU). These variables are chosen because they are available
monthly, have been used in previous studies, and while they both are associated
with the business cycle, their timing is not identical. Thus, it will be
possible to evaluate the leading indicators in prediction of different cyólical
patterns.

IV. Predicting with the Leading

Indicators

The first issue we shall explore is whether the index as constructed by
BEA is helpful in predicting the unemployment rate and the FRB index or, equivalently, whether the vector 13 in equation (1) is significantly different from

zero for x set equal to the changes in the composite index. Such tests have
been performed for the same two dependent variables and eleven of the twelve
individual components of the composite index for the period 1948:1 to 1971:12

by Neftci (1979), with the finding that only six of the eleven (series 1, 3,

—8—

8, 12, 20 and 32) helped predict (at the .05 level of significance) JQ, with
the same six series being the only ones helpful in predictin RU.

As these

variables are all highly correlated, a test which Includes them all at the
same time would be valuable.

Equation (1) was estimated for eachdependent variable with the composite
index for the sample period 1949:6 to l977:8 with the first and last lags j

and k set equal to one and ten respectively.5 Corresponding equations were
estimated with

set equal to zero, and the F statistics constructed using the

sums of squared residuals from the constrained and unconstrained regressions.
These results are displayed in Table 2 and show that changes in the index are
clearly helpful in predicting changes in the cyclical variables.

Given that the index as a whole is useful in forecasting changes in RU and
JQ, is it possible to construct an alternative index from the same twelve series
that would perform significantly better, or are the equal weights fairly appro-

priate? The use of positive and roughly equal weights for the various series
in constructing the index has been criticized in the past by several authors.
For example, Hymans (1973) argued that some of the weights should be negative.
He estimated the "appropriate" weights using a regression

of the BEA's coinci-

dent index on the component series of the leading index, using only one lag
from each series corresponding to the number of months by which that series
was supposed to lead the business cycle.

Finding some of the coefficients to

be negative, he took this as evidence that the weights of these series should

be negative. As the twelve series are highly correlated, it is not surprising
that at least some would have negative coefficients in such a regression. However, it is unclear why one would use such an arbitray procedure to choose
the weights of the index.

jointly estimate the vectors a,

of y on the lagged values of itself and the twelve individual leading indicator

weights of the leading indicator, and will allow us to determine how much better
we can do with the same data, and restriction to the use of a single index, than
is accomplished using the BEA index.
Since one of the parameters in either

those from the regressions using the BEA index, we may construct test statis—
tics, which asymptotically approach a chi—squared distribution with eleven
degrees of freedom, corresponding to the hypothesis that the BEA index weights
are optimal.

These results are interesting for a nuniber of reasons. First of all,

they suggest that the equal weight index used by BEA can be significantly improved upon in predicting the unemployment rate (RU), while the same cannot

the weights optimal in predicting the two cyclical series are the same. Third,
some of the weights derived from the regressions are negative, although only
one series has a negative weight in both regressions.

Given this methodology for choosing the weights of the index, one might

there to be two indices, one used for predicting the near future and a second

factor driving the business cycle. The results of such "split—lag" estimation
are reported in Table 4, with

set equal to 5; series x1 is used for lags 1

through 5, and series x2 is used for lags 6 through 10. The test statistic

using sums of squared residuals is asymptotically distributed as

Here,

the constraints are rejected for prediction of the FRB index, but not for pre-

diction of the unemployment rate. Thus, there is at best mixed evidence
favoring the use of a single index.

One final question concerns the stability of the relationships estimated

in this section. We have found that for at least one of the two cyclical variables being predicted, the sample fit can be significantly improved by using

weights other than those used by the BEA. But how stable is this result?

The 1974—75 recession was the

worst during the postwar period, and few

predictions were very accurate in

forecasting its severity. Thus, shortening

instructive.
For each dependent variable, RU and

JQ, we estimated equation (1) for the

three assumptions about the composite index (no index, BEA index, estimated

index) and for two sample periods, 1949:6 — 1973:10
and 1963:8 — 1973:10.

in 1963:8, although the latter do better for certain subsamples, particularly

the last year of prediction, 1976:11—1977:10. For the full sample estimates,
an interesting result may be noted: use of the BEA index results in better
prediction than a simple regression on own lagged values; moreover, it is also

superior to the index chosen with "optimal" weights. (This outcome is even
clearer when the half—sample estimates are used in prediction.) For the unemployment rate, the root mean squared error is smaller using the BEA index
rather than the estimated index for each after the four twelve—month subperiods,

despite the fact that a test of within sample fits (in Table 3) found the esti-

mated index to be superior. For the FRB index, ft is smaller for three of the
four periods and only slightly larger for the fourth.

A second finding which is consonant with the notion that leading indicators
should be most valuable in predicting turning points is that the prediction
error in using the BEA index versus a simple autoregression is lower largely
because of improved results during the first two years of the prediction period,
1973:11 — 1975:10, when the recession was unfolding.

While choosing the index weights statiscally does not appear to help in
predicting future business cycle behavior, one still might suppose that a

better leading indicator could be formed by simply dropping certain series
that do not seem to be very helpful individually in predicting the unemployment

rate or the FRB index. However, at least one simple test indicates that this
is not so. An index was formed from the unweighted sum of the six series found
by Neftci to help in explaining JQ and RU. This index proved inferior to the
BEA index in out—of—sample prediction of both dependent variables. To summarize the results, the root mean squared error in predicting RU for the period
1973:11 — 1977:10 was .03647 and .03862 using late sample (63:8 —

73;lO)

and

—18—

full sample (49:6 —

73:10) estimates, respectively, compared to .03632 and

.03317 for the BEA index. In predicting JQ, the RNSEs were .01325 and .01189
using late and full sample estimates, compared to .01235 and .01009 for the
BEA index.

VI. Conclusions
The aim of this paper has been to evaluate the BEA index of leading eco-

nomic indicators. Our results may be summarized as follows:

(1) The method of choosing series for inclusion in the index has not been
directly evaluated. However, the extensive effort devoted to assigning
and updating weights for the series included in the index has no apparent

purpose. The weights are always so close to being equal that simply
assigning the series equal weights would have no distinguishable effect
on the resulting index.

(2) Though previous work has found that only about half of the individual
series were of significant help in predicting cyclical variables, the
composite index itself is strongly significant.

(3) There is some evidence that a better within—sample fit can be obtained
by allowing the index weights to be estimated jointly with the other

coefficients in the constrained autoregression. The weights so obtained
do not resemble closely those of the BEA index, and some are negative.

(4) The stability of equations using the estimated index is rejected, while

(5) Out—of—sample prediction suggests that the BEA

index

performs better than

the estimated index, despite poorer within—sample fits.

(6) Simply excluding from the index those series which do not individually
help explain business cycle variables

worsens the performance of the BEA

indicator in out—of—sample predictions.

These findings suggest that if there really is a single index underlying
cyclical fluctuations, its identity in relation to the twelve component series
of the BEA index is unstable over time.

Thus, the equal—weight procedure

serves to smooth out such shifts. Though this does not mean that better time
series predictors cannot be found, it does suggest that, whatever the motiva-

tion of its creators, the index does serve a useful function.

Footnotes
1.

For series 3, 32, 36, 92 and 104, first differences are used, as these

series are already expressed as percentages.
2.

The index weights and standardization factors are updated more frequently

than the twelve series are determined. The weights and standardization factors
reported here are from the Handbook of Cyclical Indicators.
3.

All but series 104, the percent change in total liquid assets, smoothed,

were studied. Also examined were several other individual series not included
in the twelve making up the composite index.
4.

This period was the longest one for which comparable data was available

for all series.
5.

The ten period lag was found after some experimentation to be sufficient

in that coefficients for lags eleven and beyond were rarely significant.
6.

An alternative method of allowing for this information lag would be to

use the one—step—ahead forecasts based on estimated values of the yet un-

observed explanatory variables with lags less than three. The two methods
should yield approximately the same results.
