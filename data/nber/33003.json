    "abstract": "\n\nThe paper explores empirically the tight links between exchange rates and the global network of equity holdings. Exchange rates can be expressed in terms of \u201cequity net currency supplies\u201d, i.e. local currency stock market capitalization minus equity holdings, denominated in investors\u2019 currencies, as well as elasticities, reflecting the \u201ccentrality\u201d of currencies in global equity markets. The observed components of our exchange rate decomposition account for, on average, 95% of the monthly variation of 28 bilateral currency crosses vis-\u00e0-vis the USD and 98% vis-\u00e0-vis the EUR. We use the decomposition to elucidate the unique role of the USD in transmitting risk aversion and U.S. macroeconomic news throughout the global equity network. Our findings contribute towards explaining global financial cycles and \u201crisk-on\u201d/\u201crisk-off\u201d episodes.\n\n",
