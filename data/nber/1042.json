    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper reviews a variety of estimates of the demand and supply elasticities of educated labor. It finds that elasticities of substitution between more and less educated labor range fran 1.0 to 2.0 and that elasticities of the supply of students to colleges are also on the order of 1.0 to 2.0 while elasticities of supply to specific professions are on the order of 2.0 to 3.0. With elasticities of this magnitude, wages and employment depend on both supply and demand factors, with shifts of either schedule influencing both market outcome variables.\n\n",
