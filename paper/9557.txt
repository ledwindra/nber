Inflation Inertia and Credible Disinflation - The Open Economy Case
Guillermo Calvo, Oya Celasun, and Michael Kumhof
NBER Working Paper No. 9557
March 2003
JEL No. E31, E52, F41
ABSTRACT
This paper develops a model of inflation inertia based on optimizing forward looking staggered price
setting in a small open economy. Unlike in current models of sticky prices, transitions to a lower
steady state inflation rate take time even if they are fully credible, and they are associated with
significant output losses. There is a welfare trade-off between these output losses and the gains from
smaller inflationary distortions. For reasonable parameter values inflation stabilization improves
welfare. The optimal steady state is reached at the Friedman rule.

1 Introduction
An expanding literature on monetary policy analysis uses optimizing dynamic general
equilibrium models in which forward-looking agents face nominal rigidities. This literature builds
on the original time-dependent price adjustment formulations of Taylor (1980), Rotemberg (1982)
and Calvo (1983).1 The renewed interest in this line of research was motivated by empirical
evidence showing that monetary policy has significant short-run real effects.2 But whether the
inflation specifications derived from such models can fully account for all short-run empirical
properties of inflation and output has recently been much debated.3 In particular, starting with
Fuhrer and Moore (1995), existing rational expectations staggered pricing models in which agents
have perfect information have been shown to display a much lower degree of inflation inertia than
what is found in the data. This in turn implies that disinflation policies have minimal real costs,
or even that anticipated disinflations cause booms (Ball, 1994a), which is also inconsistent with a
large body of empirical evidence (see e.g. Gordon 1982, 1997). This paper proposes a tractable
generalization of the Calvo (1983) staggered pricing model that generates both inflation inertia and
recessionary disinflations in a fully specified dynamic general equilibrium model.

Comprehensive surveys can be found in Gali (2001) and Lane (2001).
See, for example, Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans (1996, 1998) and Leeper, Sims and Zha (1996).

Our model retains the commonly used Calvo (1983) assumption of exogenous and stochastic
timing of price changing opportunities. Where we depart from the existing literature is in the
specification of price setting behavior. In the realistic case of a positive steady state inflation rate,
we suggest that it is plausible to assume that firms employ pricing rules which keep them as close
as possible to their flexible price optimum without incurring reoptimization costs. To keep the
model tractable, we specifically assume that once a firm gets the chance to change its pricing plan,
it jointly and optimally chooses an initial price level and a rate at which it will update its price in
the future, a ‘firm-specific inflation rate’.4 This approach differs from the two dominant approaches
in the literature. In one (e.g. Woodford , 2001) firms choose only a price level without updating. At
positive steady state inflation this has been shown to generate a monetary nonneutrality (Rotemberg
and Woodford,1998) where higher steady state inflation implies lower steady state output through
increased price dispersion. This nonneutrality is removed in the second approach, starting with
Yun (1996), where firms still choose only a price level but update their prices at the steady state
inflation rate at all times.5 But under both of these approaches only the aggregate price level is
sticky while inflation is flexible. Credible disinflations therefore do not cause recessions.
By contrast, when firms employ pricing rules of the kind we propose, an unexpected and
permanent decline in the steady state inflation rate targeted by monetary policy entails a slow
As our pricing rule does not take the simple form of setting new price levels, it is important to stress that our
motivation for time dependent nominal rigidities is not based on menu costs (Akerlof and Yellen (1985)) but instead
on reoptimization costs, such as costs of information gathering, decision making, negotiation and communication.
The empirical evidence presented by Zbaracki, Ritson, Levy, Dutta and Bergen (2000) emphasizes the importance
of such reoptimization costs relative to menu costs. Christiano et al. (2001) also stress the reoptimization cost
motivation.

As we allow for updating, our model also removes the nonneutrality.

inflation response and output losses, even if the change in policy is perfectly credible. There
are two main reasons for this. The first is the lingering effect of historic pricing decisions. The
economy initially contains a large number of firms that have chosen their price updating rates under
the previous policy, and the weighted average of such updating rates is an important component of
aggregate inflation. The second reason is the behavior of new price setters. The spread between
firms’ initially chosen price and the aggregate price level—termed front loading by Christiano et
al. (2001) —is the second component of aggregate inflation. Because firms have the option of
updating their prices, front loading will initially respond little to the policy change, contributing to
the sluggishness of the inflation response. Finally, the real interest rate change induced by the slow
inflation response gives rise to a recession.6
The motivation for our work was first developed in Calvo, Celasun and Kumhof (2001), and
is similar to that of Mankiw and Reis (2002). The latter present a model where price setters
are assumed to be able to reset their price every period, but receive information only at random
intervals. This is equivalent to assuming that firms choose a price path, and it implies that aggregate
inflation responds to monetary policy changes with a lag and that disinflations are recessionary.
The Mankiw and Reis (2002) model is capable of generating predictions that qualitatively match
the inflation inertia and recessionary disinflations features of the data. Its drawback, however, is
that the model’s microeconomic foundations are not fully laid out, which makes it harder to explore

Empirical tests of the pricing model based on Mexican data, and reported in Calvo, Celasun and Kumhof (2001),
are supportive of our inflation specification, suggesting that our formulation is a sensible way of capturing inflation
inertia in similar countries.

its quantitative predictions and their sensitivity to the values of structural parameters. It is therefore
also not possible to conduct welfare analysis. The general equilibrium model of Burstein (2002)
can be seen as a way of providing microeconomic foundations for the Mankiw and Reis (2002)
formulation.7 However it is a nonlinear model and therefore complex to solve. We argue that it
is reasonable to focus on equilibria characterized by a constant steady state growth path for the
nominal anchor. The model can then be solved by linearizing around that steady state. In that case
it is sufficient to allow firms to specify their pricing policies up to the growth rate of their price
path. A considerable advantage of this approach is that our model can be solved with conventional
solution methods, which makes it straightforward to conduct quantitative work including welfare
analysis, as will be shown in Section 4.
The literature related to inflation inertia also encompasses models of backward-looking
behavior, imperfect credibility, learning and supply side rigidities. Until quite recently the literature
mostly relied on specifications that were not explicitly built on forward-looking optimizing
behavior. Fuhrer and Moore (1995) present a relative real wage model, while Ghezzi (2001) and
Clarida, Gali and Gertler (1999) modify the Calvo (1983) model to allow for a share of price setters
to be backward looking, in the sense of using a rule of thumb that depends on lagged inflation. A
well-known explanation for inflation inertia during disinflations is lack of credibility, e.g. the
papers by Ball (1995) and Calvo and Vegh (1993). However, in many countries where disinflations
were costly the monetary authority enjoyed a high degree of credibility, as argued e.g. by Ball
In Burstein’s (2002) model pricing decisions are state- as well as time-dependent, but a pure time dependent
model is shown to be sufficient to characterize disinflationary dynamics when the disinflation is not too large.

(1994b). This is therefore only a suitable explanation for a limited number of cases. Models of
learning about monetary policy have recently become popular, and clearly such models do give rise
to inflation inertia. Two examples are Woodford (2001) and Erceg and Levin (2002). Christiano,
Eichenbaum and Evans (2001) generate inflation and output inertia in a rational expectations model
by introducing a number of nominal and real supply side rigidities. Their most successful model
variant does however still rely on a backward-looking price and wage updating scheme.
The pricing mechanism we propose is very general and can be embedded in a variety of
macroeconomic models. The key features of inflation inertia and recessionary disinflations are
robust across such environments.8 For this paper we choose an open economy setting, and for
our specification of disinflationary monetary policy we choose exchange rate targeting.9 The
disinflations we have in mind are the moderate disinflations experienced by several industrialized
countries in the 1970s and 1980s, and by a number of countries in Latin America in more recent
years.10
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the model. Section 3
discusses model calibration and computation of solution paths for a permanent and credible
disinflation. Section 4 evaluates the welfare trade-off between the output losses and efficiency

For example, Kumhof, Cespedes and Parrado (2002) analyze the closed economy case in a discrete time stochastic setting.
9
A model of inflation targeting is analytically more complex while displaying very similar qualitative features.
10
Historically, many exchange rate based stabilizations of very high inflation have been characterized by an
initial consumption boom followed by a later recession, see Calvo and Vegh (1999) for a survey. Our model
does not incorporate elements that could generate such a boom, such as lack of credibility or wealth effects.
Our result that inflation inertia by itself leads to an initial recession is consistent with Calvo and Vegh (1994),
who posit a wage setting equation that is not derived from optimization.

appendices.11

2 The Model
Consider a small open economy which consists of a government, a continuum of measure one
of identical price-taking infinitely-lived households, and a continuum, indexed by j ∈ [0, 1], of
monopolistically competitive infinitely-lived nontradable goods producing firms. The economy
trades goods with the rest of the world, and for the prices of these tradable goods purchasing power
parity is assumed to hold. Normalizing the foreign price level to one this implies that the nominal
price of tradables equals the nominal exchange rate Et . The nominal price level of nontradable
goods is denoted by Pt , and the associated inflation rate by π t = Ṗt /Pt . The relative price of
tradables and nontradables, which will be referred to as the real exchange rate, is et = Et /Pt . The
economy can also freely borrow from or lend to the rest of the world, and uncovered interest parity
is assumed to hold:
it = r + εt .

(1)

Here r is the exogenous, constant and positive real international interest rate, εt = Ėt /Et is
the rate of exchange rate depreciation, and it is the nominal interest rate on domestic currency
denominated assets.

Households
Households maximize lifetime utility, which depends on their consumption of homogenous
tradable goods c∗t , heterogeneous nontradable goods ct (j), j ∈ [0, 1], and utility from leisure 1−Lt ,
where 1 is the fixed endowment of time and Lt is total labor supply to firms. To rule out inessential
dynamics households’ personal discount rate is assumed to equal the real return r on international
bonds denominated in units of tradable goods bt . Aggregate nontradables consumption is given

which given our assumption of predetermined positive exchange rate depreciation (see below)
and uncovered interest parity must be greater than zero. The cash-in-advance constraint will
therefore be binding at all times. Households receive a fixed endowment of tradable goods y ∗ ,

Here λ is the constant multiplier of the lifetime budget constraint (8), equal to the shadow
value of lifetime wealth. Equation (9) equates the marginal utility of tradables consumption to
the marginal utility of wealth times the effective price of consumption, the latter being equal to
the purchase price plus the cost of holding the money balances necessary to conduct transactions.
Equation (10) equates the marginal rate of substitution between tradables and nontradables to their
relative price, the real exchange rate. Equation (11) equates the real wage to the marginal rate of
substitution between consumption and leisure, corrected for a monetary distortion. The latter is
increasing in deviations from the Friedman rule.

Firms
Firms in the nontradables sector are distributed uniformly along the unit interval and have linear
production functions in labor input lt (j):
yt (j) = lt (j),

j ∈ [0, 1] .

(12)

They are price takers in the labor market and monopolistically competitive in the goods market.
Firms distribute all nominal profits Πt (j) to households in a lump-sum fashion:
Πt (j) = Pt (j)ct (j) − Wt lt (j),

j ∈ [0, 1] .

(13)

Following Calvo (1983), it is assumed that firms only get infrequent opportunities to change
their prices, and that these opportunities arrive as exogenous random processes. For each firm they
follow an exponential distribution with probability density δe−δt , and are therefore independent
of their last occurrence. They are also independent across firms. This allows the application of
10

a law of large numbers and implies that firm-specific uncertainty does not translate into income
uncertainty for the representative household.
Firms maximize the present discounted value of real future profits each time they are allowed
to change prices. Their discount rate is the own rate of interest for nontradable goods r + εt − π t ,
and in addition they weight profits at each future time by the probability that today’s price will still
be in force. Firms’ real marginal cost equals the real wage in terms of nontradables wt = Wt /Pt ,
where Wt and Pt are taken as given. Firms receive a proportional output subsidy sub = (σ − 1)−1
from the government. This offsets the steady state markup distortion that arises under monopolistic
competition (see e.g. Woodford (2002)). Crucially for this paper, whenever firms do receive a price
changing opportunity they determine an optimal price schedule, consisting of today’s price level
Vtj and a firm specific inflation rate vtj . If the price schedule of product variety j was last set at
time t, we therefore have for all s > t that

It is clear that υ t is a jump variable. When there is a discrete change in the monetary policy
regime it will be optimal for firms receiving a price changing signal to allow discrete changes in
both their current price and their firm specific inflation rate.

This variable is predetermined, and its time derivative is
(30)

ψ̇t = δ(vt − ε̄) − δ(ψt − ε̄) .
Using the definition of ψt we can rewrite the expression for aggregate inflation as

(31)

(π t − ε̄) = δ(pt − 1) + (ψt − ε̄) .

This is a key equation. The second term reflects inertia in the aggregate inflation rate through
the historic pricing policies of firms which have not yet received a price changing opportunity. The
first term, the initial relative price of new price setters pt , is free to jump at time 0. Therefore,
despite the presence of an inertial component, aggregate inflation is a free or jump variable. Its
derivative with respect to time is found, after some algebra, to equal
π̇t = −(3δ + 2r)(ψt − ε̄) + 2δ(vt − ε̄) + (δ + 2r)(π t − ε̄) − 2δ(δ + r) (wt − 1)

(33)

The system of differential equations (30), (32) and (33) in ψ, π and v must be closed with
a fourth equation for real marginal cost w, derived from (11), to fully characterize the dynamic
behavior of this economy. To do so we must first describe government behavior and define
equilibrium.

Government
The government owns a stock of net foreign assets ht , issues money Mt , and makes lump-sum
transfers τ t . Its flow budget constraint is
ḣt = rht + ṁt + εt mt − τ t − sub(ct /et ) ,

A government policy is defined as a list of time paths {Et , τ t }∞

Ricardian. As for exchange rate policy {Et }∞
t=0 , we assume that the government reduces inflation
by a surprise announcement at time 0 of a permanently lower rate of exchange rate depreciation:
εt = εh , t ∈ (−∞, 0) ,
εt = εl , t ∈ [0, ∞) .

economy’s overall level of net foreign assets. Then equilibrium is defined as follows:
A perfect foresight equilibrium given f0 is an allocation, a price system, and a government
policy such that (a) given the government policy and the price system, the allocation solves
the household’s problem of maximizing (5) subject to (6) and (8), with (6) binding, (b) given

(38)

Combining this constraint with the first order condition (9) one can derive the path of tradables
consumption. This is trivial for the case of a constant nominal interest rate such as in our assumed
permanent stabilization policy, which features a constant predetermined exchange rate depreciation
path. We have
c∗t = y ∗ + rf0 ∀t .

(39)

Note that, even for the more general disinflation policies discussed in Section 4, the equilibrium
paths of tradables consumption and therefore of net foreign assets can be computed independently
from the rest of the economy because they are functions only of endowments (f0 and y ∗ ) and of
exogenous world and policy variables (r and εt ). This is useful in computing the equilibrium of
the nontradable goods market.

Complete Dynamic System
The results of the previous subsection can be used to derive a differential equation for real
marginal cost w from (11). We begin by linearizing the equation around the steady state, obtaining
(wt − 1) = (ln ct − ln c̄) +

α
L̄
(εt − ε̄) +
(ln Lt − ln L̄) .
1 + αı̄
1 − L̄

(40)

To make further progress we have to establish a relationship between c and L. It is shown in
Appendix A that L̄ = c̄ and that, after linearizing, one obtains
ln Lt − ln L̄ = ln ct − ln c̄ .

(41)

Therefore (40) simplifies to
(wt − 1) =

1
α
(ln ct − ln c̄) +
(εt − ε̄) .
1 − c̄
1 + αı̄
17

(42)

Note that steady state nontradables consumption c̄ is a strictly decreasing function of the
exogenous steady state nominal interest rate ı̄. This reflects the negative effect of deviations from
the Friedman rule on steady state output, which will play an important part in the welfare analysis.
It can be seen in the steady state version of (11):
c̄ =

(1 − γ)
.
(1 − γ) + κ(1 + αı̄)

(43)

Next we linearize equation (10) to obtain the first term of equation (42):
(ln(ct ) − ln(c̄)) = (ln(c∗t ) − ln(c̄∗ )) + (ln(et ) − ln(ē)) .

(44)

To derive a differential equation for wt note first that, given (9) and our assumptions about
government policy, exchange rate depreciation and the tradables consumption profile satisfy ε̇t = 0
and ċ∗t = 0. Secondly, for the real exchange rate we have
•

(ln et ) = εt − πt

.

(45)

Therefore we finally obtain

This equation says that a real appreciation, i.e. a rising relative price of nontradables, is
associated with a fall in real wages in the nontradables sector. The reason is that the higher relative
price lowers the demand for nontradables output and therefore for labor, which depresses the real
wage.
We now show that wt is a predetermined variable. Consider equation (42) and the possibility
of jumps at time 0. The excess demand component is decomposed in (44). The real exchange
18

rate is predetermined under predetermined nominal exchange rates and sticky prices, while the
tradables consumption path is a function only of exogenous lifetime resources and government
policies. This makes excess demand a predetermined variable. See Ghezzi (2001) and Calvo and
Vegh (1994) for similar arguments. Jumps in εt in equation (42) are also exogenous. Therefore
wt is a predetermined variable, along with ψt . The variables vt and πt are free to jump at time 0.
The full dynamic system for this economy is represented by equations (30), (33), (32) and (46). In
matrix form it looks as follows:

In Appendix B we prove that this system has two eigenvalues with positive real parts and two
with negative real parts. Given our results about the number of predetermined variables this proves
that the system is saddle path stable. It can further be shown numerically that for a very large range
of relevant parameter values13 all roots are real.

3 Model Solution and Discussion
Calibration
In this section we compute solution paths for the model after assigning the parameter values
shown in Table 1. The time unit for calibration of stock-flow ratios is one quarter. We consider a
relatively moderate disinflation from 20% to 10%, which is of the order of magnitude of several
recent and current Latin American disinflations. The parameters α and r are calibrated based on
13

We searched over δ ∈ [0.05, 2], leaving all other values at those used below in the calibrations.

19

sample averages for Brazil between the beginning of 1995 and the end of 1998, corresponding to
the main period of that country’s exchange rate based disinflation plan. Inverse velocity α is set
equal to the average of the M2/GDP ratio, giving α = 1.118. The real marginal cost of Brazil’s
borrowing in international capital markets is given by the nominal Brady bond yield adjusted for
US inflation, which equals r = 12.68% p.a.. A 50% share of tradables in consumption γ is
empirically reasonable for most countries, see De Gregorio, Giovannini and Wolf (1994). The
value for the proportion of time spent working in steady state, L̄ = 1/3, is based on the evidence
cited in Cooley and Prescott (1995). We assume that this is the value associated with the high
inflation steady state, and compute the larger value associated with low inflation from (11). Finally,
the average length of price quotations of four quarters implied by δ = 1/4 is reasonable, see the
evidence cited in Obstfeld and Rogoff (1996, chapter 10) and Taylor (1998).
Without loss of generality we normalize the tradables endowment to y ∗ = L̄ = c̄, and initial net
foreign assets to f0 = 0. Note that for the purpose of presenting computed solution paths in Figure
1 we renormalize the initial steady state values of tradables and nontradables consumption to 1.
The log-linear specification of the utility index implies an intertemporal elasticity of substitution of
one. Empirical estimates of this elasticity are typically below one, as in Reinhart and Vegh (1995).
However, see Ogaki and Reinhart (1998) and Eckstein and Leiderman (1992) for examples of
estimates closer to one.

Dynamic Response to Disinflation
Figure 2 shows equilibrium paths for an unanticipated permanent inflation stabilization from
20% p.a. to 10% p.a. In a conventional Calvo-Yun sticky price model this would have no real
effects, and aggregate inflation would immediately jump to 10%. By contrast, in our model
inflation π does not immediately jump to the new lower steady state level. As can be seen in
equation (31), this has two main reasons. The first is the lingering influence of historic price
setting decisions on current aggregate inflation through the weighted average of past firm-specific
inflation rates ψ. While ψ immediately starts to decline it can only adjust slowly as and when
additional firms revise their pricing policies. The second reason is the behavior of current price
setters. Given the permanent nature of disinflation, the response of their updating rate vt is very
strong, and consequently the extent of their front loading pt need not change very much. But pt
is the second component of aggregate inflation. Inflation therefore also responds slowly because
current price setters can spread their response to new information out over time, unlike in the
Calvo-Yun model.

21

The slow response of nontradables inflation combined with the immediately lower exchange
rate depreciation implies that the real exchange rate appreciates sharply. In other words, the own
real rate of interest on nontradables r+ε−π initially falls sharply, giving rise to a downward sloping
path of nontradables consumption. The lowest point, an output loss of around 2%, is reached at
the time nontradables inflation starts to undershoot exchange rate depreciation, thereby starting to
depreciate the real exchange rate to its new equilibrium level. The nontradables recession is fairly
long-lived at around a two-year duration.
In the new steady state nontradables output is permanently higher, reflecting the efficiency
gain resulting from a reduction in the monetary distortion to the consumption-leisure choice, see
equation (43). Disinflation therefore entails initial output costs and eventual permanent output
gains. A welfare-theoretic evaluation of this trade-off is undertaken in Section 4.

4 Welfare
In analyzing the effects of disinflation policy in the previous section, it was found that there is a
trade-off between costs due to an initial recession and benefits due to eventually smaller inflationinduced distortions to the consumption-leisure choice. The appropriate metric to evaluate this
trade-off is the compensating variation in lifetime consumption introduced by Lucas (1987). The
net welfare gain accomplished by a permanent reduction in the rate of exchange rate depreciation
is defined as the fraction by which consumers’ original steady state consumption basket c̄∗γ c̄1−γ
would have to be increased to make them indifferent between their lifetime utility in the

old, high inflation steady state and the lifetime utility achieved along the equilibrium path to the
new, low inflation steady state. For the disinflation shown in Figure 1 this calculation produces
a small welfare gain of 0.0272%. That is a very small gain from a 10% reduction in inflation.
Some further comments are therefore warranted. Most importantly, this is a net gain after taking
account of the welfare costs of the nontradables recession. Furthermore, it is not clear that adding
more features to the model would necessarily increase that gain significantly. On the one hand
one may prefer to introduce different or even multiple monetary distortions, which would produce
larger efficiency gains. But another reasonable generalization would be the introduction of wage
stickiness, which could considerably increase the cost of the recession. Therefore, what we wish
to emphasize in the current paper is the existence of a trade-off when disinflating under inflation
inertia, rather than the precise welfare numbers obtained.
Next we explore the sensitivity of our welfare results to two parameters, the degree of price
stickiness and the speed of disinflation. We parametrize the latter by considering gradual linear
disinflation policies of the following form:
ε̇t = −η

for t < (εh − εl )/η ,

(48)

0 for t ≥ (εh − εl )/η ,
where the parameter η characterizes the speed of disinflation. The results are presented in
Figure 2 below in terms of contours of net utility gains. The horizontal axis is the overall length
of the disinflation period or degree of gradualism (εh − εl )/η while the vertical axis is the average
duration of pricing policies 1/δ. The figure shows that, for reasonable average contract lengths of
24

up to four quarters, a disinflation from 20% p.a. to 10% p.a. produces small net welfare gains of
around 0.03% - 0.05%. These gains are always decreasing in 1/δ, because the latter deepens and
prolongs the nontradables recession. For any given 1/δ greater gradualism causes a milder real
appreciation and therefore a shallower nontradables recession. But the downside of gradualism
is the fact that the efficiency gains associated with the new less distorted steady state are realized
later. At high 1/δ the first effect is stronger and greater gradualism improves welfare. But for lower
1/δ excessive gradualism starts to reduce welfare because the efficiency gains are delayed for too
long. This is reflected in the fact that the welfare contours eventually bend downwards. Figure 2
suggests that for our chosen value of δ the length of the disinflation period should be quite short,
between one and two years.
The same qualitative results hold for any size of disinflation in our model. Whether welfare is
increased depends on the size of the monetary distortion, the average duration of pricing policies,
and the degree of gradualism. Similar results will also hold if the monetary distortion is introduced
in other ways as long as lower steady state inflation implies higher steady state welfare.
Finally, the minimum possible rate of steady state inflation is given by the Friedman rule −r,
which is also the welfare maximizing steady state. This is in contrast to a recent literature14 which,
using a framework where firms can only choose a price level, finds that the welfare maximizing
steady state minimizes relative price dispersion and is therefore found close to zero inflation, not
at the Friedman rule.

5 Conclusion
This paper proposes a model of inflation inertia in an environment of maximizing, rational,
forward-looking agents. It has set out one way to reconcile rational expectations staggered pricing
models with important empirical regularities that have been hard to explain, namely inflation
inertia and recessionary disinflations. In the proposed framework it becomes possible to conduct
an explicit welfare analysis of disinflations that quantifies the trade-off between initial recessions
and eventual efficiency gains. Under our parameterizations the latter were found to be always
larger. As a by-product it was also shown that under our price-setting assumptions the Friedman
rule continues to attain the optimal steady state.

26

An attractive feature of this approach is that it accomplishes these objectives while otherwise
remaining firmly within the ’New Keynesian’ modelling tradition. This opens up rich possibilities
for expanding an already large research agenda.

Appendix A. The Relationship between Labor Supply and
Nontradables Consumption
We begin by defining the aggregate output index yt as

(A.1)

From the definition of equilibrium we know that yt (j) = ct (j) and therefore yt = ct . Then (3)
and (4) give us

Next we define the aggregate output quantity index ỹt , using (12) and (37), as

and the alternative price index P̃t as

But from (27) the right-hand side of this equation is zero. For the linearized system we therefore
obtain the simple relationship

ln Lt − ln L̄ = (ln ct − ln c̄) .

(A.9)

Appendix B. Roots of the Dynamic System
The characteristic equation of system (47), for simplicity but without loss of generality
evaluated at the original steady state c̄ = 1/3, can be derived as
¡
¢
λ4 − 2rλ3 + λ2 r2 − 3δ(δ + r)

+λ(3δ2 r + 3δr2 ) +

(B.1)

¢
3¡ 2
δ (δ + r)2 = 0 .
2

In the following we make use of Theorem 1.2.12 in Horn and Johnson (1985, p. 42). Let the
4 × 4 coefficient matrix in (47) be denoted by A, and the four roots by λ1 , λ2 , λ3 , λ4 . Then it must
28

be true that
λ1 λ2 λ3 λ4 = det(A) =

¢
3¡ 2
δ (δ + r)2 > 0 .
2

(B.2)

There must therefore be zero, two or four roots with negative real part. Furthermore,
(B.3)

λ1 + λ2 + λ3 + λ4 = tr(A) = 2r > 0 .

This rules out the case of four roots with negative real part. For the final part of the proof, let
χx,y,z be the 3 × 3 principal minor of A associated with columns and rows x, y and z. Then the
theorem states that the following must hold:
λ1 λ2 λ3 + λ1 λ2 λ4 + λ1 λ3 λ4 + λ2 λ3 λ4 = χ1,2,3 + χ1,2,4 + χ1,3,4 + χ2,3,4

.

(B.4)

For the sake of our argument, let the roots λ3 and λ4 have positive real parts. We compute the
right-hand side and rewrite the left-hand side of (B.4) to get
(λ1 + λ2 )λ3 λ4 + λ1 λ2 (λ3 + λ4 ) = −3(δ 2 r + δr2 ) < 0 .

(B.5)

The second term on the left-hand side is positive, and therefore we must have
λ1 + λ2 < 0 .

(B.6)

This requires that these two roots be either real and negative or complex with negative real
parts. As mentioned in the text, it can be established numerically that they are in fact real for all
interesting parameter values. The same is true for the positive roots.
