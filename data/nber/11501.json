    "abstract": "\n\nParis was the undisputed capital of modern art in the nineteenth century, but during the early\ntwentieth century major innovations began to occur elsewhere in Europe. This paper examines the\ncareers of the artists who led such movements as Italian Futurism, German Expressionism, Holland's\nDe Stijl, and Russia's Suprematism. Quantitative analysis reveals the conceptual basis of the art of\nUmberto Boccioni, Giorgio de Chirico, Kazimir Malevich, and Edvard Munch, and the experimental\nbasis of the innovations of Wassily Kandinsky, Paul Klee, and Piet Mondrian. That the invention of\nabstract art was made nearly simultaneously by the conceptual Malevich and the experimental\nKandinsky and Mondrian emphasizes the importance of both deductive and inductive approaches\nin the history of modern art.\n\n",
