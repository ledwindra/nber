The first is to develop a methodological framework that can be used to introduce and discuss alternative explanations of the correlation between health and schooling.  The second is to test these explanations empirically in order to select the most relevant ones and obtain quantitative estimates of different effects.  The empirical work is limited to one rather unique body of data and uses two measures of health that are far from ideal.  The methodological framework can, however, serve as a point of departure for future research when longitudinal samples with more refined measures of current and past health and background characteristics become available.\n\n",
