Introduction
It is well known that the use of deductions in the
federal income tax to encourage certain expenditures
results in unequal subsidy rates.

In the case of most

charitable contributions, for example, the government's
effective rate of subsidy is equal to the taxpayer's
marginal tax rate if the taxpayer is an itemizer.
resulting "upside—downt' pattern of subsidies,

The

in which "the

opportunity cost of virtue falls as one moves up the income
scale" (Nusgrave and Musgrave, 1980,

p.

362), has been

criticized for its "plutocratic bias" (Vickrey, 1947, p.
131)1.

Others accept this pattern as a natural by-product

of using the deduction form in tax incentives.2 Whatever

its desirability, no one can doubt that rich taxpayers

typically face a

lower

cost of contributing

subsidy rates depend on whether a tflpayer it an itemizer.
and on the Amount of other deductions, there are other
factors that affect regio1 differences. If most
charitable gifts tend to stay close to a donor's home,
variations in subsidy rates may have a significant impact
on regional patterns of giving and on relative growth rates
in the nonprofit sector. Without evidence on the extent of
variation in subsidy rates by state or region, however, it
is impossible to judge whether such differences in
of courss, bi due to

aggregate subsidy rates are worth worrying about.

differences in average tax subsidy rates among states.

rates do tend to be based on normative considerations of

decomposition of subsidy rates.

Why Subsidy Rates Differ

When the income tax allows

a

taxpayer to deduct an

item of personal expediture, such as mortgage interest or

3

charitable contributions, the government in effect
subsidizes the expenditure at the taxpayeres marginal tax
rate.

The subsidy rates applying in such cases differ

among individuals for two reasons.
rates differ,

First, marginal tax

generally rising with income,

Second,

deduction-'based subsidies are available to taxpayers who

itemize their deductions.

The

majority who

take the

standard deduction receive no subsidy at all for additional
expenditures on favored items.

subsidy we wish to consider here

is

The rate of

in this case is equal to the marginal tax rate

for taxpayers who itemize their deductions and zero for

those who do not.

The effect of this subsidy is to reduce

the taxpayers net cost per dollar of the expenditure to
$l(l—s).

Subsidy rates can of course be calculated for

other types of provisions, such as tax credits, deductions
subject to ceilings or floors, or percentage deductions,
but in the present paper we restrict our attention to a
simple deduction with no limitation.

(1)

This formulation makes clear that subsidy rates vary
on the basis of three factors: income, deductible

expenditures, and taxpayer characteristics such as family
size and marital status.3

The effect of income on the

subsidy rate is likely to be positive, but the effect is
not unambiguous due to the negative effect of increased
deductible expenditures on the marginal tax rate, given by

Thus average

Similarly, the opportunity to make deductible
expenditures has opposing effects on the subsidy rate.

s'(X) = m It(X) + I m'(X).

(3)

Where the increase in the subsidy rate due to an increase
in itemization shown by the first term on the right

outweighs the effect due to the reduction in the marginal
tax rate, the overall impact of having more or more
expensive deductible items

is

to increase subsidy rates.

This effect is illustrated by the observation that one of
the best predictors of a taxpayers subsidy rate for
charitable gifts is whether the taxpayer is a homeowner,
since home ownership

usually accompanied by large

deductions which make it advantageous to itemize
deductions.

Similarly, living in

a state

with expensive

housing increases a taxpayerts chance of itemizing.
At the aggregate level, the effect of deduction levels

6

on subsidy rates implies that in states and regions with
higher levels of deductible expenditures (other than
charitable contributions) subsidy rates for contributions
will tend to be higher.

States with expensive housing and

heavy tax burdens, for example, will have more itemizers
and thus higher average subsidy rates for giving.

In

the amount of state and local taxes paid by a

household is largely nondiscretionary given one's state of
residence.

Taxpayers in

a

given state have little control

over the amount of state taxes they pay, although they can
influence the amount of local taxes through their choice of
a house.

There is more individual control over the size of

the mortgage interest deduction, though that cost is
certainly a function of the cost of housing in
region.

Other deductible items would appear to have only a

The states at the top have rates roughly twice the size of
those at the bottom.

When individual subsidy rates are

weighted by income, the absolute differences are greater,
although the rates are still roughly twice as high in the
top states as in the bottom states.

At the extremes, the

less than the average price of .90 in South Dakota.

If the

price elasticity of contributions is -1.3, this difference
in the net cost of giving would imply differences in

contributions of roughly 20 percent.4

To the extent that

differences such as this merely reflect geographical
differences in income alone, this gap is just an aggregate
manifestation of the income-bias inherent in the deduction
form of subsidy.

In order to assess the importance of

these disparities, it is necessary to distinguish the pure
effect of income from the effect of other regionally—
specific aspects.

Of this difference,

the disparity in income

distributions accounts for almost half and the itemization
effect for slightly more than half.

Differences in the

tendency of taxpayers to itemize their deductions therefore
is more important in explaining the difference in subsidy
rates than is the disparity in incomes between the states.

but would still differ by

.05.

The Role of the State and Local Tax Deduction
As the previous section makes clear, the itemization

effect exerts a significant effect on subsidy rate
dispersions.

The amount of itemized deductions, holding

income level constant, evidently differs markedly among
states.

One important deduction that varies by region is

the state and local tax deduction.

Taxpayers in states

with heavy tax burdens are more likely to itemize, other
things equal, than taxpayers in low—tax states.

rates from .027 to

as noted above.

When the effect

It comes as no surprise that subsidy rates for

charitable giving differ among individuals or that average
subsidy rates differ across states.

Such differences are

It

that the likelihood of becoming an

itemizer varies independently of income, causing taxpayers
in high-itemization states to be subsidized at high rates

than other taxpayers.

In particular,

taxpayers in high-tax

states tend to receiving higher federal matching rates for
their contributions than taxpayers living in low-tax
states.

This regional pattern of subsidy rates is

difficult to justify on the basis of conventional concepts
from welfare economics.
To what extent these disparities affect the regional

pattern of giving depends on the price-sensitivity of
charitable giving and the degree to which contributions
tend to be directed to local or regional institutions.

If most contributions end up in the donor's home
region, which seems likely, such simulations suggest that

the current deduction's system does have a built—in
regional bias.

The size of the bias seems small when

considering a marginal change such as eliminating the
apparently unrelated deductibility of state and local
taxes, but it appears quite significant when considering
the deduction itself as the form of the charitable
incentive.
