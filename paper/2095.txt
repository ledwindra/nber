Forecasting the Depression:

Harvard Versus Yale

ABSTRACT

Was the Depression forecastable? After the Crash, how long did it take
contemporary economic forecasters to realize how severe the downturn was
going to be? How long should it have taken them to come to this
realization? These questions are addressed by studying the predictions of
the Harvard Economic Service and Yale's Irving Fisher during 1929 and the
early 1930's. The data assembled by the Harvard and Yale forecasters are
subjected to modern statistical analysis to learn whether their verbal
pronouncements were consistent with the data. We find that both the Harvard
and Yale forecasters were systematically too optimistic, yet nothing in the
data suggests that the optimism was unwarranted.

I. Introduction
James Tobin relates the following story, which was told to him and
other members of the Harvard graduate economics club by Professor W.L. Crum.
In the 1920's the Harvard Economic Service (HES) issued monthly reports on
the current and. their expected future state of the economy. HES used three

indices, representing speculation, business, and money, to help predict the

future. Crum said that in the summer of 1929 the statistical assistant at
HES became alarmed when she noticed that the charts indicated that a sharp

downturn in economic activity was imminent. Crum did not see in the current
business situation any cause for this adverse forecast. Moreover, he feared
that a pessimistic forecast by the influential service could itself have an

adverse effect on financial markets and economic activity. Therefore, he
suppressed the pessimistic findings of the assistant,1 and the published
report did not speak of a potential downturn.

The data, in fact, provide only mild support for this account. The
account does, however, raise an interesting and general set of questions.

Was there anything in the data prior to the October 1929 stock market crash

that indicated the economy was about to enter a protracted slowdown? How
should the news of the crash have revised forecasts of economic growth? To
address these questions, we study two sets of data assembled by contemporary

business-conditions forecasters. The first consists of the three HES
indices. The second consists of commodity and stock price indices compiled
and analyzed by Irving Fisher. Fisher, who was at Yale from 1891 until his

death in 1947, was a competitor of HES. He also released periodic reports
on the state of the economy. Moreover, he was a critic of the HES indices.
In the next section, we discuss the data and procedures of the Harvard

Economic Service and Irving Fisher. We discuss how the data were prepared
and analyzed. We also compare the verbal forecasts about economic
performance in 1929 and in the early 1930's. In the following section, we
analyze the two data sets using modern statistical techniques. This allows
us to address the questions concerning the forecastability of the depression

and the effect of the crash on the statistical forecasts. We can then ask
whether the verbal pronouncements made by the contemporary forecasters match
the pattern we find in the data.

II. Description of the Economic Forecasting Services
The Harvard forecasting service was from the beginning marketed as a

business tool for executives for short- and long-range planning. By
contrast, the Fisher service was designed originally to serve as an

educational tool for the public betterment. Fisher described his service's
goal as "to accustom the public to the thought that the dollar is not a

constant but a variable" [Fisher (1934, p.385)]. By contrast, the Harvard
brochure introduces its product with the following advertisement:

As you go about your various tasks today, shaping your plans for the
coming year's business - plans which will determine largely the profits
of your concern during the coming months - ask yourself this: Wouldn't
it be really worth while if you and other members of your organization
had a tried and dependent means of judging future conditions, thus
eliminating largely the chances you must otherwise take?
[Harvard
University Committee on Economic Research (1923a, p.3)]
Later, perhaps realizing the potential profits to be had, Fisher was to

market his own service fully as aggressively as did Harvard. His prose

3

became ultimately at least as purple as that of his Harvard peers, as in
this passage from 1929:
'Dead reckoning' won't do -- even the man of millions needs the
guidance of precedent. The Fisher Digest stands between the
average investor and the loss that may follow the ill-timed or
ill-advised investment2-- it is the weather-vane, the trustworthy
barometer of commerce.

Harvard Economic Service
HES offered businessmen a comprehensive forecasting service beginning

in 1919. A subscription to the service cost $100 per year ($623 in 1986
dollars) and consisted of the Weekly Letter, which contained the Index of
General Business Conditions and an accompanying analysis and forecast, the
Quarterly Review of Economic Statistics, and special statistical

supplements. The Index of General Business Conditions was created by HES's
first editor, Warren Persons. Its three curves were meant to represent
"speculation" (the A-curve), "business" (the B-curve), and "money" (the C-

curve). The Harvard forecasts were then based on the relations determined
to exist among the three curves during any given phase of the business cycle

and on the magnitude of the movement from crest to trough of each curve.
The Harvard analysts believed that the A-curve was a leading indicator

of the B-curve. They specified a specific lag structure. Declines in the
A-curve (speculation) were interpreted as forecasting that the B-curve
(business) would begin to decline in six to twelve months [Harvard

University Committee on Economic Research (l923b, p.9)]. Although HES is
clear about A leading B, its description of the dynamics of the C-curve

(money) is ambiguous. It notes that troughs in C follow troughs in B. That

advertisement was printed in the Herald Tribune on February 25,
1929.

4

is, interest rates, which make up C, are low coming out of recessions. At
points, HES describes this as causal relationship [Harvard University

Committee on Economic Research (l923b, p.11)]. At other points in the
discussion of the indices, 1-IES notes that troughs in C precede peaks in

activity [Harvard University Committee on Economic Research (1923b, p.9)].

The problem, which HES never directly addresses, is that a leading indicator

also appears to be a lagging indicator of the previous cycle. This
ambiguity is present in all atheoretical analyses of business cycles. When
we analyze the HES series statistically, either we will assume _nat interest
rates lead activity, which is consistent with a wide range of theories of
the business cycle, or we will make no assumption concerning the ordering of
the lags.

Although the specific series that made up the three curves changed over
the thirteen years that HES published the indices, the basic index

methodology remained the same. Curve A, representing speculation, included
a series of New York bank clearings and industrial stock prices; curve B,

representing business, included outside bank debits and commodity prices;3
curve C, representing money, was based upon commercial paper rates.
To construct each of the three indicators, the Harvard methodology was

3Curve B, as first constructed by Warren Persons in 1919, was a
composite of economic series that reflected business conditions, including
both production of materials and goods (most notably pig iron production)
and transactions in commodities and services. The curve was revised in 1923
to include only bank debits and a ten-commodity price index. The position
of the baseline (Bradstreet's index) used in constructing curve B "was
determined by shifting the curve upward so that the crossing points with the
ten-commodity index would correspond to the dates of crossing given for pig
iron production, the index of trade, and outside debits" [Persons (1923,
p.187)]. Therefore, although a measure of industrial production was not
directly included in the revised B-curve, pig iron production entered into
its construction.

as follows. First, the underlying component(s) in the index were adjusted
for seasonality. Then, for each underlying component, a "similar" series
not in the index was isolated, which was thought to represent a secular

trend relative to the cyclical component in question. (For example, for the
"money" series, the baseline was the average yield of ten prime railroad

bonds of distant maturities.) Percentage deviations between each component
of the index and the "baseline" series were taken and then normalized by the

appropriate standard deviation. The resulting groups of adjusted components
were then averaged to form the relevant index curve.
The resulting indices are illustrated in Figures 1 and 2 for,

respectively, the years 1904-1913 and 1919-1931. As can be seen, there
appears to be strong predictive power in the earlier period. A close
inspection of HES's brochure suggests, however, that the remarkable fit was
in fact achieved by an "exhaustive study of business statistics, for the
primary purpose of developing a reliable index of general business
conditions" [Harvard University Committee on Economic Research (1923b, p.8)]
and that this exhaustive study was performed using data from the years 19041913.

At first glance, the data in Figure 2 do not appear to correspond
closely to Crum's account, namely that the Harvard indices in the summer of

1929 foretold the coming business collapse. All three indices appear to lag
the crash, rather than anticipate it. The brochure states that "the index
(C) also forecasts speculation" and that "a persistent rise in interest

rates was the forerunner of a decline in security prices; after such a
decline in security prices, a decline in business of several months
duration. .

." [Harvard University

Committee on Economic Research (l923b,

6

p.11)]. In the period 1927-1929 curve Chad reflected exactly such a
persistent rise in interest rates, and while it is not clear from the
service's description exactly when such a rise should ultimately be expected
to imply a stock market downturn, it is entirely possible that by the summer

of 1929 the staff saw a market decline as imminent. More importantly, the
speculation index (A) shows a major decline during the second quarter of

1929. It peaked in March and by June had declined by over ten percent.
This major but transitory decline is almost lost in a graph of curve A
including the crash, but it would have looked substantial to the Harvard
analysts during the second quarter.4
If the Harvard staff did believe that the data foretold business doom,

this was not apparent in their public pronouncements through the period of

collapse. The service painted a considerably gloomier picture earlier in
1929, only to moderate its view as the stock market continued to boom.
In April 1929, HES issued the following warning about the overheated
economic environment:

Recent developments - notably the weakness of certain commodity prices,
as well as the money tension - suggest some recession from the present
level of business. ...
A renewed unsettlement of stock prices, perhaps
a protracted liquidation, might well result under present conditions of
money tension.... Business is not in the strained condition which has
led to real depression in the past; and, while interest rates are now
higher than at any other time since 1921, the present large resources
of the reserve system give assurance that no shortagg of credit for
industrial purposes will develop.
[HES (4/20/1929)]

This view persisted through the summer of 1929. In May, the service

4mis decline is not present in either Fisher's stock price index or
the Cowles (1939) stock price index. Hence, it may have been spurious.

7

noted that "The signs pointing to recession continue to pile up" [HES
(5/18/1929)1

By mid-September, when the speculation index was rising, the tone
moderated considerably:

Recent developments (reduced volume of construction projects, below
average crop prospects, unfavorable international trade balances) have
tended to emphasize the unfavorable elements in the business (as
distinguished from the financial) situation.... But no sharp decline
has appeared in general business, and activity remains high.
[HES
(9/21/1929)]
The week prior to Black Friday, the assessment was that
If recession should threaten serious consequences for business (as is
not indicated at present) there is little doubt that the reserve system
would take steps to ease the money market and so check the movement.
[HES (10/19/1929)]
This tone persisted as calamities mounted over the coming year.

Immediately following the crash, in early November, the appraisal was that
Doubtless the losses entailed by the decline in stocks will increase
the extent of the present business recession. On the other hand, money
rates have declined promptly and considerably ... this is in itself
evidence of the soundness of the present business situation. Under such
conditions, we believe that the present recession, both for stocks and
business, is not the precursor of business depression, but will prove
intermediate in character. [HES (11/2/1929)]
By late December 1929, the Harvard staff was even forecasting recovery.
Today a depression seems improbable, and continuance of business
recession is all that is in prospect. This justifies a forecast of
recovery of business next spring, with further improvement in the fall,
so that 1930, as a whole, should prove at least a fairly good year.
[lIES (12/21/1929)]

Confidence then continued as the downturn worsened.

Since our monetary and credit structure is not only sound but unusually
strong, commercial credits are liquid, and production for some months
has probably been less than current demands, there is every prospect
that the recovery which we have been expecting will not be long
delayed, and that the only change that need be made in our forecast is
that this fall business will not acquire as much impetus as we have
been expecting. [HES (8/20/1930)]

8

Except in construction activity, the current depression seems to be
following much the same course as that of 1920-21, as respects the
length and severity of decline and the inception of recovery; and we
conclude that improvement in business volumes, the first step in
business recovery, is already under way. [HES (6/30/1931)]

A dawning awareness that this economic downturn was not similar in nature to

those preceding it is found in the final months of 1931. In August, the
Service noted that "If financial unsettlement continues in Europe, real

business recovery here may be prevented..." [HES (8/22/1931)]. And by
December of that year, the assessment had finally become quite bleak:

But though the threatening elements in the situation are wer,
adequate grounds for forecasting business revival have not yet
appeared. [HES (12/19/1931)]
The Fisher Index
Beginning in January 1923 the Fisher Index was published weekly in the
author's syndicated column, The Fisher Business Page, which was widely

carried by leading newspapers. Only in early 1930 did Fisher begin to
market a separate and more detailed financial service. Initially, The
Business Page included the Fisher Commodity Price Index and the Purchasing
Power of the Dollar Index, along with weekly discussions of relevant

economic issues of the time. In 1925, a stock market value index was added.
The later Financial Analysis Service, published by the Index Number
Institute (a company founded by Fisher), also included explicit analyses and
economic forecasts based upon the Fisher indices.6

Of the two indices published in Fisher's weekly column, the Commodity

6The Financial Analysis Service was succeeded by a similar service
named Trade and Money Index in late 1931. This service was in turn succeeded
by Market Indicators, which ceased publication in 1934.

9
Price index is substantially Fisher's "Ideal" index,7 which "is an
aggregative formula representing the fluctuations in value of a fixed budget
or an imaginary cargo consisting of specified quantities of 200 goods. The
index number for any date is simply the ratio of the value of the cargo, at
said date, to its base value, multiplied by the base number."8

The

Purchasing Power of the Dollar index is simply the inverse of the Commodity
Price index -- and
thus a duplicative measure. The duplication is, however,

central to Fisher's missionary ideas for his service. He aimed to educate
the public and thereby eliminate money illusion. His stated view of the
Purchasing Power index is that:
The purchasing power of the dollar is shown separately from the
commodity price level, although one is the reciprocal of the
other, to emphasize the importance of the purchasing power of the
dollar. As the price level goes up, a dollar will buy less; as
the price leel declines, the dollar will buy more.
[Fisher
(5/14/1924)
The stock price index that was later added to the service consisted of a
weighted value index for the market, with stocks picked based on a standard

of "popularity." The index was computed based on averaging the value of the
7Fisher's book The Making of Index Numbers is a "complete
survey of all
possible index formulae as any hitherto attempted." It concludes that the
"'ideal' is the best form of index number for
general purposes." In this
book Fisher analyses a number of indices published at the time. In a
footnote, Fisher comments on the Harvard index
methodology: "One of the most
interesting kinds of index number is Prof. Person's new index number for use
as a barometer of trade. In this case the selection of the 10 commodities
included is based, not on any of the usual criteria, but on their previous
behavior in relation to the business
cycle" [Fisher (1927, p.336)].

The formula . is J[(Ep1q0/Epq0)(Ep1q/Epq)J
that is, a geometric
average of base and current perioa weightea indices [Fisher

(1923, p.835)].

previous week's fifty best-selling stocks, based on total market value of

share turnover. The index was linked across weeks by calculating a
composite average based on the subsample of stocks that appeared in both

weeks' indices)0
Unlike HES's, Fisher's forecasts were simple and straightforward
applications of the classical paradigm, allowing for some rigidities slowing

adjustment. Thus, for example, a falling dollar and rising commodity prices
"shows that the volume of money and credit available is increasing faster
than its utilization in the production and exchange of goods and services.

When more money and credit are applied to the same (or smaller) volume of
goods and services, it results in increased competition by the funds for the

available goods and services."11 Rising commodity prices would thus
engender a forecast of declines in real interest rates, a rising industrial
production rate, and increasing inventories due to increases in the value of
goods.

The Fisher Service is closer to a modern economic analysis and

forecasting tool. It simply provided businessmen, policy-makers and the
public with an analysis of current macroeconomic data from the perspective

of then-current macroeconomic and financial theory. Fisher's service thus
stands in contrast to the chartist exertions produced by members of the
Harvard Economic Service.

Although Fisher's economic analysis are on firmer theoretical grounds
than Harvard's, his predictions in the period before and after the crash,

10See Fisher (1927) for a description of the index methodology.

methodology, "How to Use Fisher Indexes" by Newdick, was part of the
Financial Analysis Service subscription package.

11

were no closer to the mark than those of his Harvard

brethren. Indeed, his

analyses during 1930 and 1931 were, consistently, even more optimistic than
Harvard's.
In September 1929, Fisher was bullish about

future prospects, seeing

none of the potential warning signs that the Harvard service had noted
through the summer of that year.'2

We have witnessed probably the
greatest expansion in history, within
any similar period of time, of the real income of a people.... The
alarm over the supposed inflation of security values seems unjustified
by the recent record of dividend yields, increases which doubtless will
be followed by much larger increases. [Fisher (9/2/1929)]
The day before Black Friday, Fisher continued bullish in the face of the
(relatively) small perturbations that had rocked the market in recent weeks
and stirred concern on Wall Street.

The (stock-market) break certainly exhibited signs of a market rendered
topheavy by the activities of shoals of speculators,
acting
unintelligently, who at last became frightened and dumped millions of
shares in a way temporarily to
swamp the Exchanges.... The only event
which can bring about a serious decline in stock value is a severe
business slump, which does not seem likely from present indications.
[Fisher (10/28/1929)]
Immediately after the crash, the outlook remained optimistic.
The price of industrial stocks at less than 11 times their earnings
seems too low a ratio, in view of the expectation of a faster rate of
earnings in future and of the diminished risks of modern investment
methods.... The market has, therefore,
good reason for recovering on a
new plateau. [Fisher (11/4/1929)]
As the recession deepened, Fisher's optimism bordered on advocacy,
inveighing against dire interpretations of the direction of current
indicators.
12

.
.
.
.
.
optimism, however, is consistent with his data. In contrast
to the Harvard speculation index (A) which shows a ten percent decline from
March to June 1929, the Fisher stock price index shows no decline.
Similarly, the Cowles (1939) stock price index, which has been widely used
in recent studies, has some fluctuations
but is essentially flat over the interval.

Fisher's

12

It should be noted that while the stock exchange endured the severest
panic in history, this did not suffice to shake the price level of
stocks off a warrantable high new plateau, which had been built up
since 1922.... The function of the stock market is to reflect the
discounted value of future increased business, as clearly foreshadowed
in the increasing rate at which earnings are plowed-back into industry.
[Fisher (12/30/1929)]

While prediction is always hazardous in economic statistics, and I wish
to avoid making any definite prediction, it would not be surprising if
by next month the worst of the recession will have been felt and
improvement looked for. [Fisher (1/20/1930)]
In the early summer of 1930, Fisher remained unwilling to read calamity into

the current economic situation. Comparisons with the 1920-21 recession
predominated in his analysis -- as they did in Harvard's --

but

Fisher's

brand of optimism remained both stronger and more colorful.
It seems maiifest that thus far the difference between the present
comparatively mild business recession and the severe depression of
1920-21 is like that between a thunder-shower and a tornado. [Fisher
(5/19/1930)]

By winter of that year, Fisher finally acknowledged the seriousness of the
economic situation; yet like members of the Harvard group, he continued to
see the potential for an imminent upturn and expressed his hopes with
mounting drama.
Doubtless, to many, this will be the winter of our discontent, and to
all of us it is as gloomy as the darkness that precedes dawn.... One
would expect the bottom to be reached in the stock market prior to the
upturn in commodity prices. Since the middle of November this seems to
have been the case.
[Fisher (12/1/1930)]
In attempting to review and estimate the business situation, it is
sometimes necessary, during a business depression such as this, to find
hopeful signs in negative figures. Such a peculiar state of affairs
holds true just now.
[Fisher (2/2/1931)]

The industrial giant has become conscious again. He is beginning to
move around slowly in an effort to regain his feet, as the cobwebs from
a knockout blow gradually clear from his brain. [Fisher (2/23/1931)]
By the end of 1931, when the Harvard team had begun to admit to the reality
contained in the steady flow of bleak economic data, Fisher maintained his

13

optimism.

Business showed further gain last week, and if improvement continues at
the present rate, September should mark the low of the depression.
Particular attention is called to the fact that commodity prices for
both raw materials and agricultural products were strong. No single
factor would be as helpful to business as a cessation in the commodity
price decline that has been continued for the past two years. [Fisher
(10/17/1931)]

III. Statistical Analysis
The above excerpts from the Harvard and Yale services make it clear
that the services neither explicitly predicted a downturn in their written
analyses nor, following the crash, predicted correctly its dire implications

for future macroeconomic activity. Harvard's C-curve might have warranted a
pessimistic forecast before the crash, but this evidence is not very strong.
The question considered in this section is whether the use of modern
statistical procedures reveals any evidence in the data of a forthcoming

depression. The data examined are Harvard's A, B, and C indices and
Fisher's commodity price and stock price indices.13
In the first statistical exercise, we attempt to formalize the timing

relationships among the A, B, and C indices posed by HES. The B series is a
contemporaneous measure of business activity. In this first exercise, we
take the B series as the object to be forecast. The B series did turn down
sharply at the time of the crash. According to HES, the B series was lead 6

130ne way to analyze the question of whether the depression was
forecastab].e would be to construct a structural econometric model based on
the data prior to the depression and then see if the model predicts the
depression based on predictions of the future exogenous variable values that
seems likely to have existed at the time. Our aim in this paper is much
more modest. We simply want to examine the monthly Harvard and Fisher data
for signs of an impending slowdown. Hence, we estimate reduced forms that
would be consistent with a wide range of models.

14

to 12 months by the A series, which was largely determined by movements in

stock prices. The conventional valuation model for asset prices also
suggests that the stock market should be a leading indicator of activity.

Asset prices should react instantaneously to events that take time to affect

real activity. As discussed earlier, the Harvard analysts are less clear
about the relation of the B and C series. At points they suggest that C
should lag B, but elsewhere they suggest that it, like A, should be a

leading indictor.14 Of course, absent a theory, the question of whether a
series leads or lags in the cycle is wholely arbitrary. In the following
analysis, we treat both A and C as leading indicators of B.
To capture the timing relationships posited by the Harvard analysts, we

estimate the following regressions. The analysts sometimes suggested that
the A series (speculation) was forecastable by other series, which is, of

course, inconsistent with the martingale model for asset prices. We

estimate a univariate, second-order autoregression for A)5 In the equation
for series B, we include lags 6 through 12 of both series A and C to capture

the timing relationships discussed above. We also include the first two
lags of B itself. Without them, errors remain strongly serially correlated.
Because of the ambiguities in the analysts' discussion of series C, we treat
series C symmetrically with series A, that is, as a univariate, second-order
autoregression.

14See Harvard University Committee on Economic Research (l923b, p.9-li).
151f series A were point-in-time data just for stock prices, we would
expect a random walk model to be the best approximation. The data, however,
are averaged and include information on bank clearings, and so we include
the extra lag. If required returns are predictably time-varying, perhaps C
should forecast A. This possibility is allowed in subsequent
specifications.

15

These and all the subsequent equations include constant terms and are
estimated using the data as published, which are corrected for trend and

seasonal factors.'6 All data used in this paper are presented in the
Appendix. The equations are estimated by ordinary least squares.
To evaluate whether the A, B, and C series were useful in forecasting

the depression, we estimate the system just described and then compute

dynamic forecasts based on the estimates. Estimation is carried out through
the month prior to the beginning of the forecast period. The first month of
the estimation period is January 1920. The forecasts are computed over a 24

month horizon. The first forecast period considered begins in July 1929,
and so the first estimation period ends in June 1929. The three estimated
equations for this first estimation period are (standard errors are in
parentheses):

16We expect that the Harvard Economic Service's detrending procedure
induces spurious cyclicality in the published series. See Nelson and Kang
(1981) and Mankiw and Shapiro (1985). Because we are trying to mimic the
contemporary procedures, we do not wish to attempt to correct for any
spurious cycles.

Equation (1) reveals that A is nearly a random walk. C in equation (2) is a
second order autoregressive process with approximately a unit root. In
equation (3) none of the A and C variables is individually significant,

although the hypotheses that the coefficients of the A series are jointly
zero and those of the C series are jointly zero are both rejected with more
than 95 percent confidence.17
Table 1 presents the actual and predicted values of the B series.

Column 1 contains the actual values, and column 2 contains the predicted
values from equations (1) -

(3)

above. The forecast in column "

contains no

evidence confirming the statistical assistant's fear that a collapse in

business activity was imminent in the summer of 1929. If anything, the
A,B,C series indicated a strong economy over the next six months. Although
there is a slight downturn forecast at the beginning of 1930, the predicted

fall is very mild. Hence, this forecast implies that Crum appears to have
been correct in his view that the data did not bear out the alarm raised by
the assistant.

Seven more forecasts are presented in Table 1. Starting dates for
these forecasts are October, November, and December 1929; January, May, and

September 1930; and January 1931. For each of these forecasts the above
three equations were reestimated through the month prior to the beginning

month of the forecast. The beginning month for all estimation periods was
January 1920.

The forecast in column 3, which is the forecast immediately before the

crash, shows very robust economic activity. This forecast is driven by the
huge increase in the value of stock prices, which continued through early

17The F(7,6l) statistics are 2.34 and 2.20 for the respective tests.

autumn. The first forecast that reflects the news of the decline of the
stock market (column 4) does not have the very favorable outlook of the

previous forecast. Yet, it shows a continued strong medium run outlook with
only a small downturn in the first half-year. The next forecast (column 5)
is, however, much more pessimistic because the decline in stock prices is

fully reflected in the lagged values in the equation for A. Subsequent
forecasts show temporary downturns over the forecast horizons, but fail to

capture the continuing decline in activity into 1931. The pessimistic
forecast in the last column reflects the continuing decline in the B series

throughout 1931. In summary, our analysis of the HES data using the lag
structure suggested by the Harvard analysts does not show that the

depression was forecastable. It also indicates that the slow adjustment of
the forecasts to the bad news of the crash was consistent with the data.
For the rest of the statistical work we use an alternative measure of

economic activity from the B series. The series we consider is the Federal
Reserve Board's monthly, seasonally adjusted industrial production index,

denoted IF.18 This index is available beginning in 1919. The industrial
production index, of course, was never in the information set of the

contemporary forecasters. Yet, it is one of the best indicators of economic
activity available to modern researchers. Insofar as the contemporary
forecasters were interested in predicting the level of activity, it is of
interest to see how well they could predict the IF series.
For a basis of comparison, we first estimate second order

autoregressive equations for IP and use these equations to forecast. The
equations are specified in log form. The estimation periods are the same as
those used above except that the beginning month for all periods was March

1919 rather than January 1920. The estimated equation for the period
through June 1929 is:

(4) log IP = .0374 + l.399.log 1P1 - .4l3.log
1P2
(.0322) (.081)
(.082)
DW =

1.97, R2 = .980,

SE = .0253

Sample period: March 1919 - June 1929.
The coefficients on the two lags of IP suni almost exactly to one. Hence,

shocks to IP are estimated to be permanent, yet will lead to some short run
fluctuations.

The actual values of IP are presented in column 1 of Table 2, and the
predicted values from equation (4) are presented in column 2.

(The results

in Table 2 are reported in terms of the level of IP even though the

estimated equations are in terms of logs.) The sum of the coefficient
estimates of the two lagged values in equation (4) is close to one.

Therefore, the shocks to IF are essentially permanent; the forecast in

column 2 exhibits little short-run dynamics. This is also true of the other
forecasts in Table 2. All the sums of the two coefficient estimates in the
reestimated equations are close to one. The predicted levels in columns 3
through 9 thus follow the decline in the initial conditions as the

depression unfolds, but they do not anticipate the continuing negative
19

growth.

191fl analyzing these forecasts (as well as the ones to come), it is
worthwhile to keep in mind the period over which the underlying equations
are estimated. Except for a sharp downturn in 1920 and 1921, the sample

19

The next exercise is to see how accurately the Harvard indices predict

IP. We already have forecasting equations for A, B, and C, namely equations
(1) -

(3),

and so we merely need to add an equation relating IP to these

indices. It seems consistent with the thinking of the Harvard analysts to
include the values of the B variable in the IP equation but not the values

of the A and C variables. As noted above, the B variable is meant to be the
measure of current economic activity, whereas the A and C variables are

leading indicators. The IP equation that we estimate includes B, B lagged
once, and the first two lags of IF. We included the two lags of IF to
eliminate serial correlation of the error term and to nest the previous

experiment in this one. We used the same estimation periods as we used for
the first experiment, where the beginning month is January 1920. The
equation estimated through June 1929 is:

The B variables are significant, and the standard error has dropped from

0.0253 in equation (4) to 0.0249. There is thus a slight improvement in
explanatory power. The coefficient estimate for B is positive and that for

B1 is negative, as expected. The sum of the two coefficients is negative,
which is not as expected, although the sum is small and not significant.2°

reports the forecasts of B for the same system, the mid-summer forecast
(column 2) shows no evidence of an imminent collapse of the economy.

Interestingly, the October forecast in column 3, which is the last one
before the crash, does show a moderate decline in output (6.4 percent over

two years). About the same rate of decline is predicted in the next month's
forecast (column 4), which is based on initial conditions that include the

crash. In subsequent months, however, the forecasted levels remain flat.
We have so far been following the six to twelve month timing

relationships seen in the data by the Harvard analysts. For the next
exercise we drop these relationships and instead estimate a second order

vector autoregressive (VAR) model for the A, B, and C indices. We use this
model to forecast A, B, and C. We also estimate an IP equation, where log
IP is regressed on a constant, log IF lagged once and twice, and A, B, and C

unlagged and lagged once. The beginning month for all the estimation
periods is March 1919. The estimated equations for the period ending in
June 1929 are:

Series A, which is dominated by the stock market, is, not surprisingly,

approximately a random walk. Shocks to series B are also very persistent,
although the financial series A and C do enter with the appropriate signs.

Again, series C is close to having a unit root. Series B does, however,
enter the equation significantly (on a joint test), and so the HES view that

causality runs only from C to B can be rejected. In the IF equation both B
and C are significant.
The forecasts from equations (6) -

(9)

and the rolling reestimated

versions are presented in Table 4. The July 1929 forecast (column 2)
provides some support for the view that the A, B, and C indices contained

evidence for an adverse outlook in the summer of 1929. For this forecast IP
falls almost 15 percent over two years. As it turned out, such a forecast
was optimistic in light of the events, but it is very pessimistic when

viewed from the prospective of the strong performance of the 1920's. The
pessimism of the statistical forecast is driven by the decline in the
speculation index during the second quarter of 1929 from its peak in March.

The index had lost over ten percent of its value from March to June. This
decline was also probably the source of the pessimism in the HES's verbal

discussion at this time. The outlook had, however, turned optimistic by the
October forecast (column 3). The optimism is driven by the increases in the
speculation index. Even the crash was not enough to make the November

22

forecast (column 4) show a decline in IP, although subsequent forecasts

become more and more pessimistic. The burst of optimism in mid 1930 is due
to a transitory, sharp increase in the speculation index.

The mid-summer 1929 forecast based on the HES VAR does provide some weak
support for the account that the HES data signalled the coming downturn.

This forecast is driven by the decline in the speculation index in the

spring. That decline was not present in other stock price indices and may
be spurious. Consequently, Cruxn may have been justified in suppressing its

implications in the verbal pronouncements. His action was justified by the
upturn in the summer and fall of the speculation index, and hence, the
general outlook.

To summarize, our statistical analysis of the HES data produces the
same, persistently negative forecast errors as found in the HES's verbal
pronouncements.

Irving Fisher did not publish an indicator of business activity. His
service was more immediately concerned with financial markets. Nonetheless,
his articles made clear statements about the performance of the economy.
The real indicators should be linked to the financial ones in Fisher's view.

"Every enlargement of the dollar tends to hurt business shortly afterward

and every shrinkage of the dollar tends temporarily to boost business. Thus
the dollar's changes forecast, so far as any one factor can do, the volume

of trade and unemployment" [Fisher (1934, p.386)]. For our last exercise we
consider a VAR model using Fisher's stock and commodity price indices,

denoted S and P. We estimate a second order VAR model for log S and log P
and an IP equation with log IP regressed on a constant, log IP lagged once

and twice, and log S and log P currently and lagged once. The beginning

23

month for all estimation periods was March 1925, which is the earliest we

could get all the data. The estimated equations for the period ending in
June 1929 are:

The stock market equation has a significant second own lag, although the sum

of the two coefficients is almost exactly one. These higher order dynamics
may be accounted for by Fisher's procedure for changing the series in the

index. Recall that Fisher's stock price index was calculated using each

week's fifty best-selling stocks. Including stocks that do well might
account for the acceleration of the series during the weeks before the

crash. The commodity price index appears essentially unrelated to stock
prices. In the IP equation the stock price variable is weak.
The forecasts from equations (10) -

(12) and the rolling reestimated

versions are presented in Table 5. Unlike the results in Table 4 for the
Harvard system, the Fisher forecasts show strong growth during the summer

and early fall of 1929, The implied growth rates of over 10 percent at

24

annual rate were very optimistic. As news of the crash is incorporated into
the system, forecast growth remains positive, but much less strongly so.

These results are consistent with Fisher's continued optimism in late 1929
and early 1930 despite the recent, rapid declines in output and asset
prices.

IV. Conclusion
We have presented two types of evidence concerning the ability of the

two forecasters to predict the depression. First, we have exwAned their
verbal pronouncements over the months preceding and following the stock

market crash. Both Fisher's and the Harvard Economic Services's forecasts
were optimistic before the crash. After the crash, each saw the unfolding
events as transitory setbacks that did not diminish prospects for growth in

the future. Hence, as the economy continued to decline, the forecasters
appeared to be systematically too optimistic. Second, we have used the
series published by the forecasters to construct statistical forecasts of

economic activity. In doing so, we have taken advantage of our superior
ability to measure economic activity by using the Federal Reserve Board's

index on industrial production. Thus, we have asked what the forecasters
would have predicted based on their data had they been equipped with a
modern indicator of economic activity and modern statistical techniques.
The statistical findings -

- except

support for Crum's account - -

are

for the one forecast that provides mild

broadly consistent with the verbal

pronouncements. The statistical findings mirror the verbal pronouncements'
systematic overprediction of economic activity. Hence, the verbal
pronouncements are consistent with the underlying correlations in the data.

25

Examination of the estimated equations,

or equivalently of the tables

of forecasts, reveals why it would be incorrect to criticize the forecasters
for their persistent optimism about the prospects for recovery. The
dynamics of the equations for the real variables are dominated by unit

roots. The levels of the forecasts are driven almost

exclusively by the

initial conditions; they display negligible short run fluctuations.
Consequently, the view embodied in the verbal pronouncements that the
economy had sustained a serious shock, but could be expected henceforth to
grow much as it did in the past, is exactly what
time series would read from the estimates.

a practitioner of modern

Neither the onset nor the

persistence of the decline in the economy in the 1930's was predictable from

the data for the l920's. One might thus conclude that Harvard and Yale
tied. They were both justified in holding to what turned out ex post to be
an incorrect view.

various issues of the Review of Economics and
Statistics 1919-1922, and
the Harvard Weekly Letter 1923-1931.

Fisher's Wholesale Price Index appeared in various issues of the Journal of
the American Statistical Association 1923-1930, a revised series
appeared in JASA Reprint, September 1930.
Fisher's Stock Index was collected from Fisher
Scrapbooks 1925-1927 (Yale
Manuscript and Archive Collection) and Index Number Institute releases
