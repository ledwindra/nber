ABSTRACT
As the level of retirement-related assets has grown, so too has public and private interest in so-called
"Socially Responsible Investment" (SRI), an investment strategy that employs criteria other than the
usual financial risk and return factors when selecting firms in which to invest. This study evaluates
whether SRI indexes would alter portfolio risk and return patterns for the new defined contribution
pension plans currently on offer in Japan. We conclude that SRI funds can be included as an option,
albeit with some cost; consequently, mandatory investment in SRI portfolios cannot reasonably be
justified.

Socially Responsible Investment in Japanese Pensions
It is sometimes suggested that socially-targeted investment objectives may overlap with
individual investment strategies for retirement saving products, by mediating the process of
social targeting through individual preferences and the capital market. This study examines the
pros and cons of socially responsible investment (SRI) criteria for pension investors in Japan, to
develop a better understanding of how such criteria might be introduced into investment
strategies for pension plans, and what the implications of SRI rules might be on investment
performance.
There are many different definitions of SRI both in the West1 and in the growing Asian
funded pension market.2 Defining what constitutes SRI is difficult, since criteria selected to
target “in favor of” or “against” companies are often subjective and vary from one group,
individual, and nation, to another. In addition, formulating benchmarks and evaluating
performance for such socially targeted investments is a complex, involved, and sometimes costly
objective process.
In the Japanese case, interest in SRI rules is just beginning to evolve, although questions
of corporate governance have a longer history (Hiraki et al 2003). As indicated by recent
amendments to the methods used for investment of Japanese Postal Saving System (JPSS) assets,
fiduciaries are gradually moving JPSS investment allocations away from social targeting toward
1

For example, the Social Investment Forum (http://www.socialinvest.org/Areas/SRIGuide/)
defines SRI as “[i]ntegrating personal values and societal concerns with investment
decisions …[it]considers both the investor's financial needs and an investment’s impact on
society. With SRI, you can put your money to work to build a better tomorrow while earning
competitive returns today.”

A discussion of SRI activity in Asia is provided by ASRIA [2002] who argues that “sustainable
and Responsible Investment (SRI), also known as Socially Responsible Investment, is
investment which allows investors to take into account wider concerns, such as social justice,

2

more conventional financial criteria, in part because of concerns that sub-optimal investment
decisions were made in the past [Lincoln, 2001]. Nevertheless, many Japanese intellectuals,
business leaders, and politicians remain convinced that socially targeted investment of some kind
will be important for the future of the nation [Nishimura and Saiko, 2003].
The pension asset market in Japan is substantial. In March 2005, the Bank of Japan
reported total pension fund assets at JPY 93.6 trillion.3 Since 2001, Japan has been encouraging
the development of defined contribution (DC) plans, and there is currently debate over whether
SRI portfolios should be offered in these plans. While Japan SRI portfolios are quite small, they
are likely to grow rapidly in coming years.

In what follows, therefore, we begin with a

discussion of the introduction of SRI developments in Japan and a comparison between the two
most important SRI indices marketed in Japan, namely Morningstar SRI and FTSE4Good. The
following section compares the performance four hypothetical SRI funds derived from these two
SRI indices with that of standard Japanese stock market indices. Then we discuss our methods to
adjust the survivor bias that might be introduced in backward looking analysis.
We find that the hypothetical SRI portfolio performance is not significantly different
from that of the corresponding hypothetical market portfolio. Subsequently we turn to the
question of whether an SRI designation contains market information in its own right regardless
of the weights attaching on each SRI stock, and again we use hypothetical portfolios to address
this question in an econometric approach. A final section concludes.

economic development, peace or a healthy environment, as well as conventional financial
considerations.”

This compares with USD7.3 trillion in US pension funds [Bank of Japan 2005]

Social Responsible Investment in Japan
Few English-language papers discuss the topic of SRI funds in Japan (c.f. ASRIA ,
[2003], Kawamura [2002, 2004], and Solomon et al. [2004]), and while they are informative on
the newly developing SRI movement in Japan, they offer little in the way of technical analysis of
the performance of Japanese SRI funds. To this, we turn next.
Japanese SRI Indices. There are currently two established SRI indices and around 10 SRI
funds in Japan, most of which are environmentally-focused. The first SRI index was introduced
by Morningstar in May 2003; in September of 2004, FTSE launched its FTSE4Good index for
Japan.

Both indices focus on socially responsible corporations in Japan. Our approach in

addressing SRI performance in Japan is to focus on these two SRI indices, which we compare
against key market indices. Because the indexes were established only recently, we also take a
backward look at the performance of the SRI indices (from Jan 1997 to Feb 2005). The time
period used is, in part, imposed by data availability; but also SRI advocates argue that it is only
in the last few years that SRI principles have been explicitly and consistently adhered to by
responsible firms. For this reason, they argue that a longer time period may in fact confuse the
analysis.
Understanding Japanese SRI Indexes.

Our comparison relies on the components of the

Morningstar-SRIJapan and the FTSE4Good indices as of September 2004. In that month,
Morningstar reported 150 stocks in its SRI index, whereas there were 166 in the newly launched
FTSE4Good set. Taken as a whole, 233 Japanese stocks were included in SRI Japan indices, but
only 83 stocks were common to both indices. As indicated in Table 1, if we regarded these 233
Japanese stocks as the possible universe of socially responsible Japanese corporations, the
FTSE4Good index includes 71% of the SRI stocks, and Morningstar includes 64% of the set.

4

Table 1 here
Our further analysis also indicates some rather interesting differences between the two
SRI-Japan indices, both in terms of the companies that are included and also in their weights.
One striking finding is that the two indices differ strongly with regard to the top ten stocks
included (Table 2). The top 10 group represents about 40% and 35% of the index weights for the
FTSE4Good Japan and Morningstar SRI Japan indices, respectively. Most prominently,
FTSE4Good includes the two large motor companies Toyota and Honda, while these are omitted
by Morningstar. Conversely, Morningstar includes the Mizuho Financial Group and Takeda
Chemical, but these are excluded by FTSE4Good.
Table 2 here
It is also interesting that the weights of the eight stocks that both indices list in their top
10 differ markedly. Thus, Toyota and Honda represent about 15% of the FTSE4Good Japan
index, while Mizuho Financial Group and Takeda account for about 9% of the Morningstar
index. Although both indices used free floating market capitalization as the basis of their index
weights, it is apparent that important differences remain in the top 10 stock rankings for the two
SRI indices. As another example, NTT is ranked first in the Morningstar SRI, representing
5.31% of the portfolio, but that firm ranks only 9th by FTSE4GOOD, representing 2.40% of the
mix.
Why do these two SRI portfolios differ so substantially? First, the two rating firms report
that they draw from a different underlying stock universe in developing their indices. Elements
in the FTSE4Good Japan list are selected from the FTSEJapan list. By contrast, Morningstar’s
SRI stocks are selected from 3600 listed Japanese companies. Second, the stock screening
processes used by the two SRI groups are unlikely to be identical. This is because FTSE

5

indicates that it relies more heavily on international SRI conventions, 4 while Morningstar
appears to adhere to more localized criteria.
In evaluating the performance of these two indexes, we are faced with the problem that
the firms included in the two sets may have been influenced by “cherry-picking:” that is, the
particular firms selected might have been influenced not only by positive screening reports, but
also because of positive past returns. If this were the case, a positive retrospective statistical
relationship between social and financial performance could be contaminated by selection bias.
This problem is difficult to solve. The most persuasive study would have to compare the future
performance of the SRI indices selected years earlier, against future market experiences.
A Retrospective Assessment of Japanese SRI Performance
In the meanwhile, we believe that a retrospective analysis does provide useful
information. Specifically, we compare the financial performance of several alternative Japanese
SRI portfolios against the major Japanese stock index TOPIX.5 A top 10 constituent portfolio
and a full index portfolio were constructed respectively for Morning Star SRI Japan (MS) and
FTSE4GOOD Japan (F4G) according to their launching weights as of in May 2003 and Sep
2004. The portfolios then were rebalanced monthly using their initial weights constantly.
Results of the retrospective analysis appear in Figure 1. One striking finding is that all
four SRI portfolios outperformed the TOPIX index over the 98-month sample period (Jan 1997 ~
Dec 2003). Indeed, it is rather remarkable that, while the TOPIX lost about 20% in this span, all
of the alternatively-weighted SRI portfolios achieved positive returns. Figure 1 indicates that
4

http://www.ftse.com/ftse4good/news/FTSE4Good_Criteria_Development_Report_2004.pdf.
Morningstar SRI was developed by the Public Resource Centre and Professor Kanji Tanimoto of
Hitotsubashi University.

6

FTSE portfolios gained above 60% while Morningstar SRI hypothetical funds achieved over
50% total return in a 8-year recession period.
Figure 1 here
Of course, higher returns may come with higher risks, so next we ask whether holding a
Japanese SRI portfolio might have reaped higher performance in exchange for risk. Table 3
shows that the SRI portfolios we have devised were generally not significantly more volatile than
the Japanese market indices, at least over the period from 1997-2005. For example, the
annualized monthly volatilities were around 16% and 17% for the two responsible full-index
funds, just slightly below or equal to that of the TOPIX (17%). Further, as the entire stock
market was moving, none of the funds appeared more volatile than the market as a whole, as
indicated by the fact that all the betas of SRI portfolios are below one.
Table 3 here
To summarize, these results indicate that the Japanese SRI portfolios constructed using a
constant-weighting method with the Morningstar and FTSE4Good set of stocks outperformed the
market averages using TOPIX over the 98 months ending in Feb 2005, without taking on
additional market risk. Yet caveats remain. First, few years of data are available to track SRI
fund performance. Second, it must be recognized that because the SRI indices are quite new in
Japan, retrospective analysis runs the risk of cherry-picking and other bias. Additional years of
data will be required to generate firmer conclusions.
SRI versus Alternative Benchmarks
Thus far we have used TOPIX as the main Japanese benchmark against which we
compare various hypothetical SRI portfolios derived from two key SRI indices in Japan. But a
5

TOPIX is selected as a proxy for the Japanese stock market because it is a market-cap weighted

7

problem with this is that the TOPIX is a dynamically-changing index, whereas our analyses of
SRI stock portfolios are of necessity backward-looking. Thus potential benefits of a hypothetical
SRI portfolio are easily conflated with the benefits of hindsight. We have already mentioned
cherry-picking, but there is also the broader issue that performance of the TOPIX index reflects
corporate failures, mergers, and acquisitions, which a backward-looking approach does not take
into account.
Accordingly, we seek to correct for this inconsistency by developing a hypothetical
market portfolio of our own for the purpose of comparing it with alternative SRI portfolios. This
market portfolio, for convenience labeled the JMP index, is constructed from the Nikkei 500 and
the FTSE Japan index, 6 augmented to include those Morningstar SRI stocks not included in
either index, for a total of 563 stocks. We then consider these as a ‘universe’ of current Japanese
stocks, from which the SRI stocks may be drawn. Next we construct what we call a “JMP SRI
index” (JMP-SRI), which includes all the stocks in both the Japanese MS SRI and the
FTSE4Good indices. Altogether, 233 SRI stocks are included, almost all of them drawn from the
two market Japan portfolios.
To construct both portfolios, we use dynamic market capitalization as weights, rebalance
monthly, and, consistent with our earlier analysis, we exclude dividends.7 Both the JMP and
JMP-SRI indices include only stocks which existed in September 2004, and for which at least
two years of data are available. Both are thus subject to symmetric survivor bias. In our

index, although it is not as popular as the NIKKEI225.
6
The number of stocks within the FTSE Japan index is about 480 over time; as of 15 March
2005 there were 479 stocks included.
7
In Japan, the size of dividend change has been found to have a strong positive effect on the
magnitude of the excess returns (Kato et al 2002). However, the dividend effects show no
significant differences between the SRI stock group and non-SRI stocks; detailed regression
results available on request.

8

comparison analysis, we therefore implicitly assume that this bias has similar effects on both
portfolios.
Figure 2 plots the price performance of the JMP and JMP-SRI funds over our sample
period; for comparison, we also reproduce the TOPIX index line. The results are striking: the
JMP and the JMP-SRI portfolios track each other closely over the sample period, while the
TOPIX return line falls significantly below these two. In other words, the apparently superior
performance of the SRI portfolio detected in the previous section when compared to the TOPIX
evaporates when we use our alternative all-Japan market benchmark.
Figure 2 here
We also note that the combined SRI portfolio substantially underperformed the various
hypothetical SRI portfolios such as MS150 or F4G166. A possible explanation could be the
different weights attached to various stocks and the rebalancing strategies. The constituent
weights of firms in both SRI index funds are not precisely consistent with their market
capitalization due to liquidity, investability and other possible considerations.8
The Information Value of an SRI Flag in Japan
Our last finding raises the question of whether new information is provided by knowing
that a firm has been selected to be a member of a SRI portfolio. To investigate this question, we
pool the data across both time and stocks in order to learn whether any information is carried by
an SRI designation on a stock-by-stock basis, regardless of the weights.9
Accordingly, Model 1 compares stock-by-stock performance with the overall market
represented by the JMP portfolio and asks whether an SRI flag adds statistical explanatory power.
8

Morningstar adjusts the market capitalization weights on the basis of liquidity considerations,
while FTSE adopts the concept of “investability.”

9

Specifically, we regress the excess return of each JMP stock over the 98 months for which we
have data, on the monthly excess return of the market and an indicator which indicates whether a
stock has been designated as SRI-admissible in either the MS-SRI or FTSE4Good set. The
hypothesis is that if an SRI flag contained important market information, the flag would be
significant. The regression equation for model 1 is thus given by:

ri ,t − r f ,t = α + β (rJMP,t − r f ,t ) + γ ⋅ SRI i + u1
where ri ,t − r f ,t is the excess return of ith stock in tth month over the corresponding risk free
return; rJMP,t − r f ,t gives the excess return of our JMP hypothetical portfolio over the risk free
return in tth month; and SRI i is the dummy variable representing the life-time SRI label10 for ith
stock. In a second formulation, we add controls for market cap bias11 and investment style bias12
(Model 2):
ri ,t − r f ,t = α + β (rJMP ,t − r f ,t ) + γ ⋅ SRI i + ψ ⋅ CAPi ,t + ω ⋅ PBi ,t +u 2
where CAPi ,t represents the market cap of ith stock in tth month; and PBi ,t represents the price to
book value ratio of ith stock in tth month.
The two models above are designed to reveal the ability of SRI flag to carry additional
alpha. One step further, one might also be interested in finding the potential information of risk.
Model 3 and 4 add to the first two models an additional interaction term (rJMP,t − r f ,t ) × SRI i , so

9

Large-cap stocks often dominate the overall performance of a portfolio, and therefore the
equally-weighted approach may be a good compromise to control for weighting bias.
10
We also tried the monthly SRI flags as possible candidates but they are statistically
insignificant.
11
Small company effects and fund size effects are suggested by Luck et al. [1992], Wood [1992]
and Gregory et al. [1997].
12
See also Bauer et al. [2002] for more detail on investment style bias in SRI analysis.

10

that the impact of SRI flag on beta can be studied. Furthermore, a pre- and post- comparison is
also carried out around the time when the first SRI index was launched in May 2003.
Econometric estimates appear in Table 4. Model 1 indicates that the SRI flag is now not
significantly different from zero for the period prior to the initial launch of the SRI index. After
that, the SRI flag has a negative impact on financial performance. We also expand the regression
models to take account of differences in cap size and price-to-book value ratios. Here we again
find a negative but slightly reduced impact when controlling on market capitalization bias and
growth/value style bias in Model 2. In Models 3 and 4, we evaluate the impact on intercept
(alpha) and also the potential information on the slope (beta). Interestingly, the negative impact
of alpha is no longer statistically significant, but the betas of SRI stocks are now significantly
lower than the average of non SRI stocks.
Table 4 here
From a statistical perspective, then, we conclude that the SRI flag is not informative
about a stock’s performance before the concept of SRI was officially introduced to Japan; that is,
ex ante, SRI stocks did not perform better. By contrast, the post-launch evidence suggests that
holding a SRI portfolio might involve financial sacrifice13 vis a vis a diversified market portfolio.
This is of course consistent with conventional portfolio theory [Rudd 1981 and Chami et al
2002], although others (for example Evans and Guido [2004]) find no underperformance in a
global context. Other explanations also exist for our results. Bauer, Koedijk and Otten [2005]
and Bauer, Otten and Rad [2005], for example, provide evidence that SRI funds tend to perform
poorly in their early years, when going through what they term a “learning effect” or “catching
up phase”, and subsequently perform much better. As well, returns might be reduced because of

11

the cost of compliance associated with SRI accreditation. Our results also suggest that Japanese
SRI companies are risk adverse14 in their financial decision making and market performance. A
possible explanation for this is that firms adhering to SRI principles, or striving to meet SRI
criteria, take less risk and have a generally more conservative management style than others.
Conclusions and Implications

We examine socially responsible investments in Japan, focusing on possible roles for SRI
in pension portfolios. Because the two key indexes in Japan, the Morningstar-SRI Japan and
FTSE4Good Japan indexes, were established only recently, we opt first to take a backward look
at the performance of these indices for the eight years between December 1996 and Feb 2005.
Looking backward, we find that these SRI portfolios outperformed the TOPIX stock market
index over the sample period, quite an accomplishment since the market as a whole lost about
20% over the period. Another interesting finding is that the SRI portfolios we examine were not
significantly more volatile than the TOPIX index. The short time span available for analysis,
however, is a concern, particularly because some of the SRI portfolios underperformed the
market immediately after the introduction of the Morningstar SRI index. When we look forward
over the short period since the establishment of the funds, results suggest a risk-adjusted return
somewhat below the market.
The implication is that Japanese historical evidence offers no support for the position that
Japanese pension participants would benefit from being required to invest in firms included on
SRI lists. At the same time, we also find no strong reason to preclude Japanese pension

13

Risk-adjusted underperformance is estimated at around 18 basis points per month (2.2% p.a.)
below the market average. See Appendix A for more detail.
14
The cap-weighted SRI portfolio had beta of 0.92 with JMP hypothetical market portfolio as the
benchmark in a post launch analysis. Further, the volatility of SRI portfolio was about 74 basis
points lower than that of the proxy of market.

12

participants from investing part of their pension assets in an SRI-based portfolio if they so desire,
provided participants are made aware of the potential costs of this decision.15 To this end, the
experience of one of the largest US pension plans may be instructive, that of TIAA-CREF, a
$325B (US) retirement system covering faculty and staff in higher educational and research
institutions. This large and influential pension system offers pension participants several
investment choices, among them a Social Choice Account which currently manages more than
$6 billion (US) in assets. Individual employees and retirees may elect to invest in this, or several
other funds, as they see fit.
SRI funds in Japan are still quite new, but we anticipate that they are likely to grow in
popularity as pension asset pools develop and as individual employees are granted more
influence over their pension asset allocation decisions. Accordingly, our analysis should be of
use in demonstrating how performance measures for socially-targeted investment funds might be
constructed and evaluated in the Japanese context. Additional research is required to evaluate
whether SRI funds should be expected to play a different role in defined benefit versus defined
contribution pensions, and also whether public sector versus corporate pension funds should take
a different stance regarding SRI policies. Further analysis is also required on how pension
supervisors and regulators might respond if socially-targeted investments in pension funds were
to become very popular in Japan. As pension asset pools become increasingly important in
financing the retirement benefits of a growing elderly population, clearer policies will be needed
defining when and how pensions might be permitted to opt for SRI investments.

et al. [2004].

# Model 1 is an OLS regression of the monthly excess returns of each stock in JMP against the excess returns of
JMP index and a stock-specific SRI flag; Model 2 adds an additional risk control of big/small cap bias and
value/growth style bias; Model 3 adds an interaction term between SRI flag and excess return of JMP; Model 4
combines Models 2 and 3.
* indicates the parameter estimation is statistically significant at the 0.05 level.
**Pre refers to the 77 months of the sample period prior to the formal launch of SRI indices in Japan (Jan 1997 to
May 2003); Post stands for the rest of the sample period from June 2003 to Feb 2005 for a total of 21 months.

Sources: Authors’ calculations based on data supplied by the Securities Industry Research Centre of Asia-Pacific (SIRCA) on behalf of Reuters over the 98
month period up to Feb 2005. A top-10 and a full index portfolio were constructed respectively for Morningstar SRI Japan (MS) and FTSE4GOOD Japan
(F4G) according to their launching weights as of May 2003 and Sep 2004. The portfolios were then rebalanced monthly using their initial weights. Some of
the stocks were not listed over the whole period of study, so their weights were shared by other stocks accordingly. JMP stands for a hypothetical portfolio
constructed by the authors as a representation of the Japanese stock investment universe; it contains 563 stocks and is weighted by market cap and
rebalanced monthly. The portfolio comprises all stocks in the NK500 index, the FTSE Japan index, and the Morningstar SRI index as of Sep 2004 (as long
as there were at least 24 monthly return observations over the period). The rationale for the JMP portfolio is to control for survivorship and new company
bias. JMP SRI is the SRI subset of JMP index containing 233 SRI stocks, either from MS150 or F4G166. This combined SRI portfolio was rebalanced
monthly using market capitalization. JMP_E and JMPSRI_E are equally weighted JMP and JMPSRI portfolios. They are included in our study to have a
control of big cap bias. Dividends are not included in the comparison, since an accumulation TOPIX did not exist until June 2001. Alpha and Beta are
monthly estimates of the CAPM model. Pre-launch refers to the 77 months of the sample period prior to the formal launch of SRI indices in Japan (Jan 1997
to May 2003); Post-launch stands for the rest of the sample period from June 2003 to Feb 2005 for a total of 21 months.
