    "abstract": "\n\nFinancial crises are bank runs. At root the problem is short-term debt (private money), which while an essential feature of market economies, is inherently vulnerable to runs in all its forms (not just demand deposits).  Bank regulation aims at preventing bank runs. History shows two approaches to bank regulation: the use of high quality collateral to back banks\u2019 short-term debt and government insurance for the short-term debt. Also, explicit or implicit limitations on entry into banking can create charter value (an intangible asset) that is lost if the bank fails.  This can create an incentive for the bank to abide by the regulations and not take too much risk.\n\n",
