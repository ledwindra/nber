ABSTRACT
We examine the properties of house price fluctuations across eighteen advanced economies over the
past forty years. We ask two specific questions: First, how synchronized are housing cycles across
these countries? Second, what are the main shocks driving movements in global house prices? To
address these questions, we first estimate the global components in house prices and various macroeconomic
and financial variables. We then evaluate the roles played by a variety of global shocks, including
shocks to interest rates, monetary policy, productivity, credit, and uncertainty, in explaining house
price fluctuations using a wide range of FAVAR models. We find that house prices are synchronized
across countries, and the degree of synchronization has increased over time. Global interest rate shocks
tend to have a significant negative effect on global house prices whereas global monetary policy shocks
per se do not appear to have a sizeable impact. Interestingly, uncertainty shocks seem to be important
in explaining fluctuations in global house prices.

I. Introduction
House prices in many advanced countries have moved in tandem during the past decade. They first
increased unusually rapidly prior to the global financial crisis reaching in some cases levels not
previously seen. House prices then collapsed over the period 2006-11 and have recently started to
rebound in some of these countries. These highly synchronized fluctuations in housing markets first
coincided with a period of high growth, but then were followed by severe financial disruptions and
deep recessions. In light of these observations, this paper addresses two specific questions to have a
better understanding of fluctuations in global housing markets: First, how synchronized are housing
cycles across countries? Second, what are the main shocks driving movements in global house prices?
Our interest in house prices is clearly motivated by recent developments, but there are also simpler,
and probably more fundamental, reasons to study the dynamics of housing markets because of the key
role housing plays in modern societies. First, housing satisfies peoples’ need for shelter. Second,
housing related activities account for an important fraction of GDP and household expenditures. Third,
housing is the main asset and mortgage debt is the main liability held by households in many advanced
countries. Therefore, large movements in house prices, by affecting households’ net wealth and their
capacity to borrow and spend in residential investment, can have serious macroeconomic implications.
In theory, interactions between house prices and the real economy can be amplified when financial
imperfections are present. This amplification largely occurs through the financial accelerator and
related mechanisms operating through firms, households and countries’ balance sheets. According to
these mechanisms, an increase (decrease) in asset prices improves (worsens) an entity’s net worth,
enhancing (reducing) its capacity to borrow, invest, and consume. This process, in turn, can lead to
further increases (decreases) in house prices and produce general equilibrium effects.1 In other words,
disturbances in housing markets can translate into much larger cyclical fluctuations in the real
economy.
A number of recent theoretical studies have shown how developments in housing markets can magnify
and transmit shocks to the real economy using the financial accelerator mechanism in the context of
DSGE models. For example, Iacoviello (2005) constructs a model with firms’ collateral constraints
connected to real estate, and finds that collateral effects are critical to replicate the changes in
consumption in response to movements in house prices.2 Other studies have focused on how credit
constraints affect macroeconomic fluctuations using a framework where house prices and business
investment are linked (Liu, Wang, and Zha, 2011).

Early contributions include Bernanke and Gertler (1989), Bernanke, Gertler, and Gilchrist (1999), and Kiyotaki and
Moore (1997). Surveys of this literature can be found in Gertler (1988) and Claessens, Kose, and Terrones (2012).
2
Aoki, Proudman and Vlieghe (2004) quantify the effect of shocks on housing investment, house prices and
consumption in a model in which houses serve as collateral to reduce agency costs related to borrowing. Other studies
analyze the importance of disturbances in housing markets in explaining certain features of business cycles (see
Monacelli (2009) and Davis and Heathcote (2005)).

3
A series of recent empirical studies document strong linkages between developments in housing
markets and the real economy. For example, Claessens, Kose, and Terrones (2010, 2012) report that
downturns in housing markets are highly synchronized across countries and that the degree of
comovement rises especially during periods of synchronized recessions (Figure 1). Their results
suggest that recessions accompanied with housing busts tend to be longer and deeper than other
recessions, and recoveries associated with housing booms are often shorter and stronger (Table 1).3
Despite the apparent consensus on the importance of housing market movements for the real economy,
our understanding of the sources of synchronization in housing markets is rather limited. As we
summarize in the next section, a number of studies analyze the sources of house price movements, but
they report mixed findings. Moreover, the nature and identification of shocks vary significantly across
studies making the interpretation of their findings difficult. For instance, some studies emphasize the
importance of country-specific house price shocks in the transmission and synchronization of house
prices. Others argue that interest rate shocks play a key role in driving movements in house prices.
There are also other studies highlighting the importance of demand and supply shocks in housing
markets and country-specific structural characteristics.
Our study contributes to the large body of research by focusing on the extent and sources of the
synchronization in global housing cycles. Specifically, we extend the literature in four dimensions.
First, we study different measures of the synchronization of house prices and analyze how the features
of house price cycles compare with cycles in output and other financial variables. Second, we identify
shocks driving house prices using various approaches commonly employed in the literature, including
a standard recursive method and one based on sign restrictions. In the former, we consider how shocks
to output, house prices, equity prices, credit, and interest rates affect movements in house prices. In the
latter, we formally identify and study the importance of a sequence of structural shocks, including
monetary, credit, productivity, and uncertainty shocks.
Third, we employ a series of FAVAR (Factor Augmented VAR) models to analyze the importance of
different types of shocks in explaining movements in global house prices. It is critical to study how
house prices react to worldwide shocks to get a better understanding of the synchronization of global
housing cycles. Finally, we consider the impact of shocks on housing cycles in different groups of
advanced countries over a long period.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we briefly summarize recent
research analyzing the roles of different types of shocks in explaining house price movements. In
Section III, we introduce our database and methodology. In Section IV, we present the main features of
housing cycles and analyze the synchronization of housing cycles. In Section V, we analyze the
3

Leamer (2007) documents that there are strong linkages between cycles in housing markets and business cycles in
the United States. There is evidence that the duration and amplitude of housing cycles vary widely across
geographical areas and through time (Cunningham and Kolet, 2007; Hall, McDermott and Tremewan, 2006). Alvarez
and others (2010) report that regional housing markets are weakly correlated in the major euro area countries. This
reflects variations in demand-supply conditions, characteristics of housing finance, and linkages between housing and
real activity.

importance of a variety of shocks in driving house prices. Section VI concludes.
II. What Do We Know About Synchronization of House Prices? A Brief Review
There is a growing literature that analyzes the importance of various shocks in driving national and
global house prices. We present a brief review of this literature considering three types of studies
according to the methods they employed. As the review shows, the literature paints a rather blurry
picture about the relative importance of different types of shocks.
Studies employing VAR models. The first group of studies examines the roles played by shocks to
interest rates or monetary policy in explaining national house prices using VAR models. Some of these
studies use a recursive scheme to identify shocks (Assenmacher-Wesche and Gerlach, 2010; Calza and
others, 2009; Goodhart and Hoffmann, 2008; Cardarelli and others, 2008; Gupta and others, 2012). In
these studies, shocks to interest rates are often interpreted as monetary policy shocks. Others employ
sign restrictions to identify monetary policy shocks (Carstensen et. al, 2009; Del Negro and Otrok,
2007; Jarocinski and Smets, 2008). Some recent studies also consider the importance of the housing
sector in the transmission of monetary policy (see Feroli and others, 2012). Sa, Towbin, and Wieladek
(2011) find that house prices respond more to monetary policy shocks in countries with more
developed mortgage markets using a VAR model. In his survey of this growing literature, Kuttner
(2012) concludes that the evidence suggests “the impact of interest rates on house prices appears to be
quite modest.” In particular, he notes that the estimated impact of interest rates shocks on house prices
reported in these studies are consistently smaller than the predictions of the standard user cost theory of
house prices.
Studies employing Global VAR (GVAR) models. Studies in the second group mostly use GVAR models
to analyze the transmission and synchronization of house prices across countries. Ambrogio CesaBianchi (2011), for instance, report that house price shocks originating in the United States play a
significant role in driving global house prices. In contrast, Hiebert and Vansteenkiste (2009) conclude
that house price shocks play a relatively minor role in explaining house price spillovers in the euro
area. Vansteenkiste (2007) consider the same approach in the context of the US states and find that
house price shocks in California appear to be an important factor driving prices in other states. The
GVAR methodology does not structurally identify shocks implying that there is no economic
interpretation of the housing shocks in these studies. In addition, since the methodology characterizes
cross-border linkages by averaging variables into a global aggregate, it is difficult to understand how
country weights affect the influence of individual country variables in the transmission of shocks
across borders.
Studies considering a wider range of shocks and methods. The third group of studies includes research
that employs various other methodologies, including dynamic factor and FAVAR models. These also
provide mixed results about the importance of different types of shocks in explaining housing cycles.
For example, Case, Goetzmann and Rouwenhorst (1999), who study the dynamics of international
commercial real estate markets from 1987-1997 using global factors, report that the comovement
among commercial real estate markets is through output linkages. Terrones and Otrok (2004) examine
the synchronization of housing prices in a sample of 14 advanced countries using a FAVAR model
from 1970-2004. They find evidence of a global housing cycle, which moves closely with global GDP
but they do not identify the sources of the changes in house prices. In a related study, de Bandt,

5
Barhoumi and Bruneau (2010) find that house prices in the United States lead movements in house
prices in other OECD countries using a FAVAR model. Beltratti and Morana (2010) also consider a
FAVAR model using the G-7 countries. They identify shocks using a recursive decomposition and
consider demand, supply, house price, stock price, and oil price shocks. They report that both house
price and supply shocks are important in explaining global house price movements.4
III. Database and Methodology
III.1. Database
Our main dataset includes quarterly series of GDP, house prices, equity prices, credit, and the shortand long-term interest rates of 18 advanced OECD countries for the period 1971:1–2011:3. We
concentrate on this sample because it provides a broad perspective of fluctuations in global housing
markets and it is a common denominator of the cross-country data we analyze. Our sample provides a
good representation of developments in global housing markets as it accounts for slightly more than 60
percent of global GDP over the 1971–2011 period (in PPP exchange rates).
We provide a systematic examination of the synchronization of house prices and the sources of this
synchronization over two different sub-periods. The first sub-period, 1971:1-84:4, witnessed a set of
common shocks associated with sharp fluctuations in the price of oil and contractionary monetary
policy in major industrial economies. We call this period the “pre-globalization period.” The second
period, 1985:1-2011:3, represents the “globalization period” in which there were dramatic increases in
the volume of cross-border trade in both goods and assets. This period also covers a substantial portion
of the so-called “Great Moderation” era as well as the latest global financial crisis, and coincides with
a rapid increase in trade and financial linkages among the advanced countries and a broader converge
of their business cycles (see Kose, Otrok, and Whiteman, 2008). This demarcation is helpful for
differentiating the impact of common shocks from that of globalization on the degree of comovement
of housing cycles.
House prices correspond to various measures of indices of house or land prices depending on the
source country.5 Equity prices are share price indices weighted with market value of outstanding
shares. Our measure of credit is aggregate claims on the private sector by deposit money banks. This
measure is also used in earlier cross-country studies on credit dynamics (Mendoza and Terrones, 2008;
and Claessens, Kose, and Terrones, 2010). We track aggregate business cycles with real GDP
measured by chained volume series. The short-term interest rates correspond to nominal short-term
4

Igan and Loungani (2009) document that long-run house price dynamics in advanced countries are mostly driven by
local fundamentals such as demographics and construction costs, though market structure and regulatory factors may
cause short-run fluctuations.
5
It would be useful to include a measure of house volumes in addition to house prices (Moench and Ng, 2010; Stock
and Watson, 2009). However, such a measure is not available for the large cross-country sample we are exploring
here. House price series are also subject to various problems given that different countries use different concepts to
keep track of price movements in housing markets (Silver, 2012).

6
government bill rates, generally the Treasury Bill Rates, and the long-term interest rates typically are
those of the long-term government bonds.
We also use measures of uncertainty, reserves, credit spreads and default rates. Following Bloom
(2009), uncertainty is constructed using the volatility of daily equity prices of the G-7 countries.6
Reserves series correspond to total reserves. Unlike other variables, credit spread and default rates
series are available for only the United States. In order to measure credit spreads, we use corporate
bond spreads which are the yield differences between Moody's Seasoned Aaa and Baa corporate bonds
for the U.S. The Aaa bonds are “judged to be the highest quality with minimal credit” risk while the
Baa bonds are “subject to moderate credit risk and possess certain speculative characteristics”.7 The
default rate series corresponds to the monthly rates for Moody’s rated U.S. speculative-grade corporate
bonds. As in the case of credit spreads, we take the observation of the last month of each quarter as our
quarterly default rates.
Before constructing our factors and estimating the VAR models, we make appropriate transformations
in each data series. Whenever necessary, we deflate the series using the CPI to obtain real variables.
We take four-quarter growth rates of house prices, credit, equity prices, and GDP. All variables are
seasonally adjusted and expressed in percentages. We provide a detailed list of the data series and their
sources in Appendix I.
III.2. Methodology
Since our objective is to analyze the extent and sources of synchronization of house price fluctuations,
we undertake our exercise in three steps. First, we study the main features of house price movements
by paying special attention to the extent of their synchronization. For this purpose, we use a range of
approaches, including basic correlations and concordance statistics. Second, we estimate the common
component (global factor) in each variable. Third, we use a set of FAVAR models to analyze the
importance of various shocks that could explain fluctuations in house prices. We briefly explain next
the estimation of global factors and FAVAR models.
Estimation of Global Factors. To estimate the global factors, we extract the first principal component
of each variable in our database. There are, of course, alternative approaches to construct global
equivalents of these variables. For example, we could employ a full-fledged dynamic factor model, as
in Kose, Otrok, and Whiteman (2003). Their method is particularly useful to simultaneously estimate
different common factors, such as the global, regional, and country-specific factors. However, the
6

Some other measures of uncertainty, including policy uncertainty, have recently been introduced. However, their
coverage are not comprehensive enough for our purposes here (Bloom, 2009; Baker, Bloom, and Davis, 2012).
7
Since there is no single accepted measure of credit spreads, the recent literature on the importance of credit shocks
employs various alternative ones. For instance, Meeks (2012) uses a measure of credit spreads defined in terms of a
risky bond portfolio that belongs to Moody’s B1/B2 category. Such a portfolio is described by Moody’s as being
subject to “high credit risk”. Gilchrist, Yankov and Zakrajsek (2009) take a panel of credit spreads and estimate a
common factor of these spreads as their measure.

7
global factor obtained with a dynamic factor model is quite similar to the first principal component.
We use the simpler approach here since we are only interested in the global component of each
variable.
Figure 2 presents some of the estimated global factors. The estimated factors are broadly consistent
with a number of well-known cyclical episodes in the global economy. For instance, the downturns in
the estimated global house price factor take place around the global recessions. The downturn during
the latest episode is particularly striking because of its highly synchronous nature and its depth. The
increase in the global housing factor in the mid-1980s was larger than that prior to the recent financial
crisis because a larger number of countries experienced greater growth in house prices over a short
time period in the former episode. In contrast, global house prices grew gradually over a long period
before the financial crisis. The global factor has recently started picking up because of the growth of
house prices in some countries, including Australia, Canada, Switzerland, and some Nordic nations.
The global output factor is able to capture the growth dynamics around global recessions and
recoveries. The estimated factors of other financial variables also reveal interesting patterns as they
register significant declines prior to or during the periods of global recessions. The global credit factor
features contractions during periods of downturns in housing markets illustrating the strong
interactions between credit and housing markets.
FAVAR Models. The FAVAR models we estimate can be represented by:
୲ ൌ ሺ଴ሻ ൅  ሺଵሻ ሺ୲ିଵሻ ൅  ሺଶሻ ୲ିଶ ൅  ǥ Ǥ ൅ሺ୪ሻ ୲ି୪ ൅  ୲ Ǣ
 ൌ ͳǡ ǥ ǡ , and l=1,…,L

where ୲ is an  ൈ ͳ vector of variables at date t, ୪ is an  ൈ  coefficient matrix for each lag of the
variable vector with ሺ଴ሻ being the constant term, and m is the number of variables in the model. ୲ is
the vector of one-step ahead prediction error. We consider two types of FAVAR models, which differ
only in terms of the set of variables in the ୲ vector. The first type contains only the estimated global
factors. The second type mostly includes a mix of the estimated global factors and some country
specific variables, such as default rate, and spreads.8 In our estimation, the lag length, ݈, is kept at four.
When we use sign restrictions to identify the shocks, we employ Bayesian methods to estimate the
models. We use a symmetric (across variables) prior with a harmonic decay.9 We present a discussion
of the identification of shocks and the use of these models in section V.
8

The model follows the work of Bernanke, Boivin, and Eliasz (2005) who developed the FAVAR model to study the
effects of monetary policy in a closed economy framework. They compare FAVARs that treat estimated factors as
data as is done here, with more sophisticated Bayesian estimates that account for uncertainty in the estimated factors.
They conclude that there is no real gain from the more computationally intensive Bayesian methods for this type of
problem. It would be useful to consider a model explicitly accounting nonlinearities to analyze the impact of shocks
on house prices during periods of high and low financial stress episodes (Hubrich and Tetlow, 2011).
9
We estimated our FAVAR models using RATS. The tightness parameter is 0.2. We experimented with a tightness
of 0.1 and 0.5 and found the results to be unchanged other than small differences in the coverage intervals.

8
As it is often the case in the VAR literature, we need to make challenging decisions with respect to our
modeling choices. Ideally, we would use the same set of variables in each model. However, this would
require a grand model to nest all the different specifications we have because identification of each
shock with sign restrictions requires different data series. One approach to address this, for instance,
could be to estimate a large model and then be aggressive on using priors as shrinkage (as is done in
the forecasting literature). However, this could lead to problems in identifying some of the shocks, if
one pushes the coefficients on some of the variables towards zero which may be needed for the
identification of one shock but not another. Instead, we include as many of the same variables as
possible across our models but we note that each model contains a few time series not present in the
other models. We do not consider a formal lag length test in each model, but again given that we have
a limited number of observations in some of our models, our selection of four lags provides a
reasonable benchmark and is consistent with other studies in the literature (Peersman and Straub,
2009).
IV. House Price Fluctuations: Basic Facts
We start this section with a brief discussion of the main features of fluctuations in house prices, equity
prices, credit, interest rates and output. We then study the degree of comovement between house
prices, output and other financial variables within countries using simple correlations. We conclude
with a study of the synchronization of house prices and other variables across countries using different
approaches.
IV.1. Growth, Volatility and Comovement
House prices in advanced economies grew almost at the same pace as economic activity but the growth
rate of house prices has accelerated over recent decades (Table 2). Over the past four decades, real
house prices have grown at an average rate of 2¼ percent per year, slightly slower than the growth of
output. The growth of house prices differs significantly across countries (ranging from less than ½
percent per year in Germany, Japan, and Switzerland to over 3 percent per year in Spain and the United
Kingdom) and over time.
House prices are volatile with an average standard deviation of almost 7½ percent per year. The
volatility of house prices has fallen slightly over time, partly reflecting the widespread reduction in the
volatility of inflation and output in advanced countries prior to the crisis. House price volatility also
varies significantly across countries, and is generally higher the more rapid the rate of underlying
house price growth, although this relationship has weakened over the past decade. Compared with
equity prices, house prices exhibit slower growth and less volatility.
An overview of simple correlations between house prices and some key macroeconomic and financial
variables points to three key results (Table 3): First, house prices in advanced economies are
procyclical, rising in expansions and falling in recessions. The average correlation between house
prices and output is close to 0.5 over 1971-2011. The strength of the comovement between house
prices and output, however, varies across countries, being weakest in Australia, Canada, Italy, and
Switzerland, and strongest in Denmark, Finland, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. The procyclicality
of house prices can be a reflection of strong linkages between housing market and private sector

9
absorption (particularly residential investment). However, there does not appear to be evidence of a
strong lead/lag pattern between house prices and economic activity (Table 4).
Second, there is a relatively high degree of comovement between house prices and credit (Table 3).
The strong relationship can be a reflection of that housing is used as collateral in mortgage lending and
that house price movements affect the borrowing capacity of households and firms. There is also
evidence that credit often leads house prices, consistent with the findings of Mendoza and Terrones
(2008). Third, there appears to be virtually no contemporaneous correlation between housing and
equity prices and between housing and interest rates (Table 4). However, house prices often lead
movements in equity prices (see also Quan and Titman (1998)). The lack of comovement between
house prices and interest rates suggests that the availability of credit (especially during periods of lax
lending standards) might be one of the dominant drivers of house price movements in advanced
economies. Indeed, the recent house price boom prior to the global financial crisis coincided with a
period of ample liquidity in the financial sector.
IV.2. Synchronization of House Prices
The world economy has become increasingly more integrated over the past two and a half decades,
reflecting rising trade and financial linkages. Economic theory does not provide clear guidance
concerning the impact of increased trade and financial linkages on the degree of business-cycle
synchronization (Kose, Otrok and Prasad, 2012). However, some researchers have argued that
increased international linkages have led to more synchronized business cycles (Hirata, Kose, and
Otrok, 2012). Indeed, the degree of comovement of output growth across advanced economies has
increased over the globalization period. With increasingly integrated financial markets, asset prices,
credit and interest rates across advanced countries have also become more synchronized (Table 5). The
average cross-country correlation of house prices is close to 0.2. This finding is consistent with those
reported previously in the literature for other sample periods. In addition, house prices have become
more synchronized over time. The increase in the degree of synchronization has been especially
pronounced over the last six years, as house prices in several advanced economies have fallen since
2006.
Figure 3 presents the distributions of cross-country correlations of house prices, equity prices, credit
and output for each sub-period and the full sample. These figures show that the temporal increase in
the degree of correlations in these variables is statistically significant over time. These results are
consistent with the growing evidence that house prices in advanced economies have moved in tandem,
at least during certain periods (Claessens, Kose, and Terrones (2012) and Helbling and Terrones
(2003)). The recent increase in the degree of synchronization of house prices coincided with similar
developments in the real and financial sectors across advanced economies, e.g., increased degree of
synchronization of national business cycles.
In addition to simple correlation statistics, we study the degree of synchronization of house prices
across countries using the concordance index developed by Harding and Pagan (2002b). This index
measures the fraction of time that the two series are in the same phase of their respective cycles. This
definition implies that the two series are perfectly procyclical (countercyclical), if the concordance
index is equal to unity (zero). To analyze the degree of synchronization of house prices and other

10
variables across countries, we first compute the concordance statistic for each country pair, and then
calculate the median of the relevant statistic for each variable.
Temporal changes in the degree of synchronization based on the concordance metric align well with
our findings based on correlations. For the full sample, cycles in the real economy display the highest
degree of synchronization, whereas housing cycles exhibit the lowest degree (Table 6). The degree of
concordance for all variables has increased over time. In the case of house prices, for example, the
fraction of synchronized cycles has increased from 51 percent to more than 63 percent.
IV.3. Variance Explained by Common Factors
We next study the fraction of variance explained by the common factors to get a better sense of the
synchronization of house price fluctuations. As explained earlier, we estimate the first principal
component to identify the global factor in each variable. The global factor explains almost one-third of
the variation in the growth rate of house prices (Table 7). Perhaps more importantly, the fraction of the
variance of house prices explained by the common factor has increased over time from about 20
percent during the pre-globalization period to about 35 percent during the globalization period. The
common factor also plays a sizable role in explaining the variation in output and other financial
variables. In parallel to our previous findings, the common factor of each variable has become more
important over time.10
The impact of global factors on house prices varies across individual countries. For example, in the
globalization period, global factors appear to explain about 75 percent of house price movements in the
United Kingdom and the United States, but only about 10 percent in New Zealand. We run some
preliminary regressions to understand how country characteristics relate to the variance of national
house prices explained the global factor by focusing on the following explanatory variables: the level
of financial integration, population density, development of local mortgage markets, and ownership
ratios. Our results indicate that the variance of national house prices due to the global factor is
positively associated with the degree of financial integration and negatively associated with the
population density. Other studies report that the global factor of house prices is positively correlated
with the depth of mortgage markets and gains in home ownership ratios (Terrones and Otrok, 2004).
There have also been structural changes in the functioning of financial markets, due to various
financial market reforms, that can lead to more or less synchronized movements in housing markets.
The financial sector reform across advanced economies has varied in speed and depth. This has
resulted in segmented-mortgage markets, which has probably affected the extent of synchronization of
credit and housing markets across countries.
We also examine the cross-country correlations of the common factors to get a sense of the degree of
synchronization of global aggregates (Table 8). There are two major observations: First, the common
factor of house prices is highly correlated with the factors of credit and output for the full sample.
10

We also examine the linkages between global factors of house prices, output, and other financial variables using a
series of Granger causality tests. These tests indicate that there are bidirectional causation linkages in the Granger
sense between most of our global factors.

11
Second, the correlations between the common factor of house prices and the factors of credit and
output have declined over time. These observations suggest that, at the global level, the links between
housing markets and real activity have become weaker over time and house price dynamics have
increasingly moved away from fundamentals. In the case of credit, the increased integration of housing
finance into the broader financial sector during the globalization period has probably made credit less
important in driving house prices in the advanced economies.
Finally, we assess whether our findings with respect to the basic features of fluctuations in house
prices are influenced by the crisis period after 2007. This is obviously a concern given that this period
witnessed highly synchronized business and financial downturns across advanced countries. We reestimate all of the statistics for the Great Moderation period for 1985:1-2007:4. We find that our
headline results with respect to the synchronization of house prices are mostly preserved for the Great
Moderation period. For example, we find that the concordance of housing cycles went up from 51
percent in the pre-globalization period to 64 percent during the Great Moderation period.
V. Explaining House Price Fluctuations
In the previous section, we established that house price movements across the world are synchronized
to some degree. This is an interesting empirical fact in and of itself, but it naturally leads to the
question of why they are synchronized. In this section, we study how various shocks affect global
house prices.
V.1. Identification of Structural Shocks
The identification of structural shocks (monetary policy shocks, productivity shocks, etc.) in the VAR
framework has generated an enormous literature over the years. In identifying shocks, we attempt to
include the same variables in each model we use to the greatest extent possible. However, due to the
different data needed to implement sign restrictions for different shocks, there is some variation across
models. The shock identification methods we employ are not unique to this paper as the restrictions
imposed have been shown elsewhere to be derived from economic theory. We briefly provide some
intuition to motivate the theory but do not present a discussion of the corresponding structural models.
Our first identification strategy uses a simple recursive structure. The variables we include in the VAR
are the global components estimated in the previous section. The order we use is the following: output,
house prices, interest rates, credit, and equity prices. This setup is motivated by the fact that real
variables are likely to adjust slower than do financial market variables, so the order is from most
slowest temporal adjustment to the fastest. The VAR with this identification scheme provides
preliminary evidence on what types of global shocks are likely to matter and motivates the more
structural identification approach that we employ next. It also helps to reconcile our results from the
identification of structural shocks with the related literature that has used a recursive structure.
Our second identification strategy involves the use of a set of sign restrictions imposed on impulse
responses following Uhlig (2005). This identification approach allows us to produce impulse responses
that are qualitatively consistent with standard theoretical predictions. To impose sign restrictions, we
draw random impulse vectors and retain only those that meet the restrictions on the sign of the

12
response for some of the variables in the model. Implementation of this method requires us first to
draw a set of parameters from the posterior of the VAR model. We then draw a random impulse
response vector which is retained if it meets the sign restrictions implied by theory. We continue
drawing until we have 5,000 accepted impulse response vectors.11 We keep the horizon for sign
restrictions at four quarters to maintain symmetry across models we use. The selection of four quarters
also captures the idea that the impact of each shock lasts for at least a year.12 We now briefly discuss
the identification of productivity, monetary, credit and uncertainty shocks we employ.
Productivity shocks. These shocks have a long history in economics as being an important driver of
both cycles and trend movements in output. In the international business cycle literature, Crucini, Kose
and Otrok (2011) find that much of the common cycle in output can be attributed to fluctuations in
common productivity. We study instead the role of productivity in driving global house prices.
Towards this objective, we use the identifying restrictions derived in Peersman and Straub (2009).
They show that, for a wide class of DSGE models, following a positive productivity shock, output rises
and inflation falls. Productivity increases lower marginal cost which, in turn, drives down inflation in a
New Keynesian model.13 The FAVAR model used to study productivity shocks includes the growth
rates of equity prices, reserves, output and house prices as well as the levels of long- and short-term
interest rates and inflation.
Monetary policy shocks. As we discuss in the introduction, there is a large literature analyzing the
potential impact of monetary policy shocks on house prices. By changing interest rates and the cost of
borrowing, central banks may affect house prices. To identify monetary policy shocks, we use the sign
restrictions following Uhlig (2005). The restrictions are that, in response to the monetary shock, shortterm interest rates rise, reserves fall, and inflation declines (for the first 3 periods). The FAVAR model
we use to examine these shocks is similar to the previous one, except we use global credit growth
instead of the growth of equity prices.
Credit market shocks. The recent global financial crisis is suggestive that developments in credit
markets are important for economic activity. Helbling and others (2011), for instance, examine the
implications of credit market shocks for the evolution of the growth of global output. They document
that while global credit supply shocks on average do not seem to have a significant impact on global
output; they do matter in periods with elevated financial stress and difficulties in credit markets. There
appears to be a tight link between credit and housing markets in light of the correlations we reported in
11

If we reach 1,000,000 draws without getting 5,000 accepted draws, we would stop. However, this never occurred
for the models used in this study.
12
The selection of horizon length closely follows Peersman and Straub (2009) who also use the same length to
identify productivity shocks for the Euro area. There are some studies that keep the sign restriction horizon shorter
than the one we use. For instance, Uhlig (2005) identifies monetary policy shocks by keeping the sign restrictions
horizon at 2 quarters. In the context of credit market shocks for the U.S., Meeks (2012) identifies a credit shock by
imposing sign restrictions on spreads for 2 quarters and those on defaults for 12 quarters. We have conducted
sensitivity exercises to check the robustness of our results to alternative identification restrictions and horizon
assumptions. All of our main results are robust to these variations.
13
They argue that wages should rise following a positive productivity shock. This is true in models with Walrasian
labor markets. However, Otrok and Pourpourides (2011) find that micro-level wage data is inconsistent with the
prediction of models with Walrasian labor markets. We do not impose this restriction since it is not robust.

13
the previous section. We use the sign restrictions proposed by Meeks (2012) to identify credit market
shocks. The restrictions imply that, after a negative credit supply shock, credit falls while the spread
between low grade and high-grade corporate bond yields rise. An additional restriction that Meeks
proposes is that default rates do not rise. This restriction is designed to ensure that the shock is a pure
supply shock and not an endogenous response of lenders to adverse economic news.
An important data limitation we face is that we have default and spread data only for the United States.
Given that transactions in the U.S. markets constitute a substantial fraction of transactions in global
financial markets, we use these series as proxies for the world in our FAVAR models. In addition,
since the default series are available since the late 1980s only, we are unable to run our models for the
pre-globalization period with the credit shocks. The FAVAR we utilize to study credit market shocks is
similar to the previous one except that we use spreads and default rates instead of reserves and longterm interest rates. In other words, our model includes the following variables: growth rates of credit,
spreads, defaults, output, house prices, and the levels of short-term interest rates and inflation.
Uncertainty shocks. Recently, there has been significant interest in understanding the role uncertainty
plays in driving macroeconomic fluctuations. In theory, there are multiple channels through which
macroeconomic uncertainty can have an impact on output. On the demand side, for example, when
faced with high uncertainty, firms reduce investment demand and delay their projects as they gather
new information, because investment is often costly to reverse (Bernanke, 1983; Dixit and Pindyck,
1994). Households’ response to high uncertainty is similar to that of firms; they reduce their
consumption of durable goods as they wait for less uncertain times. On the supply side, firms’ hiring
plans are also negatively affected by higher uncertainty reflecting costly adjustment of personnel.
Moreover, financial market imperfections can amplify the negative impact of uncertainty on activity.
Recent empirical studies also confirm the significant role of uncertainty shocks. For example, Bloom
(2009) finds that increases in uncertainty have a pronounced negative impact on output and
employment. Uncertainty shocks account for about one-third of business cycle variation in advanced
economies and up to half of cyclical volatility in emerging market countries, implying that these
shocks play a sizable role in driving the dynamics of recessions and expansions (Bloom and others,
2012; Baker and Bloom, 2012; Carrière-Swallow and Céspedes, 2011). Other relevant research
concludes that shocks associated with uncertainty were one of the primary factors that led to the Great
Recession (Stock and Watson, 2012).
We follow Bloom (2009) and identify the shocks using a recursive scheme with the following
ordering: equity prices, uncertainty, the short- and long-term interest rates, house prices, inflation and
output. There are four main differences between our model and the setup of Bloom (2009). First, he
uses data on wages, employment, and hours instead of interest rates and house prices. Second, his data
series are monthly whereas ours are quarterly. Third, he uses HP filtered levels for aggregates with
trends while we use growth rates. Finally, we estimate a measure of global uncertainty shock using the
first principal component estimated from individual uncertainty series of the G-7 countries whereas he
focuses on uncertainty shocks in the United States.

14
V.2. Evidence on the Sources of House Price Fluctuations
V.2.1. Recursive Identification
Global interest rate shocks have a significant but delayed negative impact on global house prices
(Figure 4A). This result is consistent with earlier findings in the literature analyzing the impact of
national interest rate shocks on domestic house prices (Kuttner, 2012). The result is commonly
interpreted by some researchers as evidence of that monetary policy drives house prices.
Our interpretation of this result is that surprise shocks to interest rates—which may be market driven or
originate from the actions of the Central Bank—drive down house prices by increasing the cost of
borrowing. Mortgage credit is indeed the most important source of financing that households have in
many of these countries. However, there are important differences across countries with the
Netherlands, United States and United Kingdom showing the highest mortgage-to-GDP ratios and
France, Italy and Japan showing the lowest.
Considering these cross-country differences, we further analyze the role of interest rate shocks in
driving house prices by conducting two exercises. First, we check the impact of global interest rate
shocks at the country level. Although the immediate response of national house prices to interest rate
shocks is negative in most cases, there is substantial variation in the magnitude of responses across
countries, as shown in Figure 4B. Second, we estimate the same FAVAR model using the series of G-7
countries (instead of our benchmark sample of 18 countries). We again find that interest rate shocks
have a significant negative impact on house prices during the full sample and globalization periods.14
We present results based on a more rigorous identification strategy for monetary policy shocks in the
next sub-section.
The response of global house prices to an increase in global credit is positive and significant. Not
surprisingly, in both sub-periods, when there is robust growth in credit, house prices tend to appreciate.
House prices seem to not respond to innovations to equity returns in a significant way. This is probably
a reflection of the low contemporaneous correlation between these two asset prices we documented
earlier. Shocks to global output have a small positive impact on global house prices. We interpret this
as suggesting that robust economic growth tends to provide modest support for housing markets.
Table 9 presents the variance decompositions for global house prices and output. In the full sample,
global interest rate shocks account for close to 30 percent of the movements in house prices, with
credit contributing a more modest 10 percent. Innovations to house prices themselves account for
about half of the variation in house price series. We view this as the fraction of movements in global
house prices that we are unable to explain with the FAVAR model.

14

In addition, we consider how our results change, if we use a sample of countries for which the global housing factor
explains a larger role in explaining national house prices. Specifically, we select countries for which the global house
factor accounts for more than 25 percent of the variance of national house prices during the globalization period. We
repeat all of our exercises with this sample of ten countries. Although there are changes in our quantitative findings,
the headline results we report here do not change in any significant way.

15
We also consider some sensitivity exercises to assess the robustness our findings. First, we estimate
our models for the Great Moderation (1984-2007) period. Second, we consider the ordering of
financial variables and re-estimate our models. The results of these exercises do not lead to any major
changes in our headline findings. In addition, we undertake a simple exercise to analyze the
transmission of national shocks to global house prices. Specifically, we check the responses of global
house prices to country-specific shocks by using the national variables (instead of global ones) along
with the global housing factor in our models. Our findings are mostly consistent with the headline
results reported here but there are some differences across countries, as one would expect. This
exercise suggests that, at least in the case of large countries, such as the United States, the nation
specific shocks can generate impulse responses similar to those associated with their global
equivalents.
Our conclusion from these exercises then is that income whether earned (output) or through portfolio
(equity returns) have a muted impact on global house prices. On the other hand, the availability of
credit and the cost of that credit, i.e., interest rates, appear to have significant and persistent effects on
house prices in most specifications. These results are reduced form in the sense that each shock is
likely to be a combination of underlying structural shocks. However, we find the exercise useful for at
least two reasons. First, much of the literature uses this identification scheme and then applies a
structural interpretation to the results. This interpretation has important consequences as it is often
employed in the context of policy discussions. By comparing the results from such an exercise with a
more robust identification approach as we do in the next sub-section, we can present a better
understanding of the current literature. Second, reduced form evidence is quite valuable in suggesting
which structural shocks are likely to matter and hence provides a roadmap for progress.
V.2.2. Identification with Sign Restrictions
Monetary policy shocks. Since there is a general perception in the literature that interest rate shocks
are an important driver of house prices, as our findings mostly confirmed above, we begin with a
discussion of our results based on a formal identification of global monetary policy shocks. The results
indicate that monetary policy shocks do not appear to have a significant impact on house prices at the
global level (Figure 5A). This is in contrast to the earlier result that interest rate shocks do drive house
prices. These findings suggest that the surprise movements in interest rates that drive house prices
seem not to be originating solely from the actions of central banks. Monetary policy shocks explain 12
percent of house price variation in the full sample period (Table 10A). However, the importance of
monetary policy shocks in explaining house prices has not changed much over time.
Why do we find that interest rate shocks appear to play an important role in driving house prices but
monetary policy shocks do not? An interest rate shock is associated with an unexpected movement in
interest rates in our FAVAR model, which is not caused by shocks to income, house prices, or credit.
Moreover, interest rate shocks can be driven by factors other than just monetary policy decisions. For
example, interest rates can move unexpectedly due to changes in tax policies, changes in policies with
respect to debt accumulation, spillovers associated with international crises, and possibly many other
reasons. Our results indicate that the monetary policy part of the reduced form innovation to interest
rates is not significant, but shocks stemming from the “non-monetary policy” part are important. Our
finding of the “insignificant” role of monetary policy helps eliminate one of the main suspects seen as
a main driving force of house prices. It also provides a cautionary tale when interpreting interest rate

16
shocks in GVARs as being related to monetary policy. For the most part, interest rate shocks and
monetary policy shocks appear to be different.
The impact of monetary policy shocks on the global level differs somewhat from the results reported
by Del Negro and Otrok (2007) for the United States. They find that the impact of a monetary shock on
house prices is statistically significant. A major reason for the difference is that there are probably
more and larger shocks to country specific policy in the context of the United States then there are
global shocks to monetary policy, i.e., a shock that is simultaneous across countries. The frequency and
size of monetary policy shocks in the United States likely lead to sharper results. Another reason could
be that they study the pre-crisis period (1986-2005) but we consider a much longer period, including
the recent crisis. The impulse responses to a monetary shock reported here for the globalization period
have the same sign as the one in Del Negro and Otrok (2007), but it is not statistically significant. On
the other hand, they find that monetary shocks account for only 10 percent of house price volatility—
very close to our finding of 12 percent.
Credit shocks. We next study the importance of credit supply shocks (Figure 5B). The responses of
house prices to these shocks are essentially zero. Credit shocks have a negative and significant impact
on output for one year. They account for 14 percent of house price growth and 12 percent of output
growth. These variance shares also appear to be stable over time. The reduced form credit shocks
identified in Figure 4A had credit shocks playing a positive role on house prices. In contrast, we here
find that exogenous supply side movements in credit have not been a significant driver of house prices.
One interpretation of this finding is that credit markets usually function well and shocks in these
markets are often relatively small. Hence, shocks in credit markets do not on average appear to drive
fluctuations in house prices. This is similar to what Helbling and others (2011) find in the case of the
impact of credit shocks on the global business cycle. They report that credit supply shocks affect
fluctuations in global output especially during severe disruptions in credit markets (as it happened
during the 2007-09 global financial crisis and during the credit crunch in the United States in the early
1990s).15
Why, then, do we find that credit shocks matter in the earlier section using the recursive identification
strategy? In Section III, we document that credit and house prices move together. The result in Section
IV then is capturing these correlations in a reduced form setting. It is not appropriate, however, to
place a structural interpretation to the previous result we reported. Additionally, our finding here
implies that credit supply shocks do not matter much. It may be the case that credit demand shocks
have an impact on house prices. A possible extension is to use the framework in Eickmeier,
Gambacorta, Hofmann (2012) to separate out the impact of shocks stemming from credit supply and
credit demand.
Productivity shocks. Not surprisingly, global productivity shocks tend to drive up global output
(Figure 5C). However, their impact on output, despite being significant, is quite small. These shocks
15

The important role played by credit market disturbances in explaining the severity of certain recessions is also
reported by some recent studies (see Perri and Quadrini (2010); Mian and Sufi (2010) and Claessens, Kose, and
Terrones (2009, 2010)).

17
tend to have a positive but insignificant effect on house prices. Given that the impact of shocks to
output growth on house prices is modest, the insignificant impact of productivity shocks on house
prices is not surprising. That is, productivity here matters mostly because it drives up income, which in
theory would allow bidding up house prices. In practice, however, this economic mechanism appears
to be weak.16
V.2.3. The Impact of Uncertainty Shocks
To study uncertainty shocks, we use a recursive identification strategy and include the following
variables in our FAVAR model: equity, uncertainty, interest rates, house prices, and output. We
consider uncertainty as an exogenous variable in the same spirit that productivity is often considered
exogenous in both VAR identification schemes and in structural models. Causality between
uncertainty and the business cycle is difficult to establish—does uncertainty drive real and financial
variables, or do developments in real and financial markets lead to uncertainty? Although empirical
findings on this question are mixed, economic theory points to clear channels through which
exogenous uncertainty shocks can have a negative impact on growth, as discussed earlier.17
We present the impulse responses of global house prices, equity prices and output to uncertainty
shocks in Figure 6A. These shocks reduce output for the full sample period and globalization period.
This shows that the results by Bloom (2009) for the U.S. holds for the global economy as well, though
the impact is stronger during the globalization period.18 Our results are a bit weaker in terms of the size
of the response relative to Bloom but the shapes are similar. These shocks account for around 10
percent of output variation during the full sample period (Table 11A). Uncertainty shocks also have a
negative and significant impact on equity prices.
The impact of uncertainty shocks on global house prices is not significant in the full sample. In the first
sub-period, the impact is modest and negative. In the second sub-period, the response is positive,
significant and of long duration. However, when we focus on the G-7 countries, this shock becomes
significant for both the full sample and globalization periods (Figure 6B). More surprisingly,
uncertainty shocks tend to drive up house prices in the G-7 countries. They account for 30 percent of
house price variation in the G-7 during the globalization period (Table 11B). In other words,
uncertainty plays a central role in explaining why there is a common cycle in house prices. One reason
why this might be true is that uncertainty seems to be quite common across countries. The average
correlation of country level uncertainty with the G-7 factor is 0.81, while the average correlation of
uncertainty across G-7 country pairs is 0.62.
16

An alternative approach to identifying TFP shocks is to order productivity first in a VAR model where shocks are
identified using a recursive scheme. This of course requires a productivity series, which we have readily available for
the United States, but not the world. We analyze the implications of productivity shocks in the United States
following this approach. The results are quite similar to those from the FAVAR model we report here in that
productivity shocks have a minimal impact on house prices.
17
Bachmann and Moscarini, (2011) find that the direction of causality runs from recessions to uncertainty. In
contrast, Baker and Bloom (2011) offer evidence using disaster data as instruments, that the causality runs from
uncertainty to recessions, and Bloom and others (2012) report that growth does not cause uncertainty.
18
Our results also echo the findings in a broader area of research on the negative impact of macroeconomic and
policy volatility on economic growth (Kose, Prasad, and Terrones, 2006; Fatas and Mihov, 2012).

18
We interpret these results as follows. First, uncertainty seems to move in tandem in the G-7 countries.
Second, uncertainty seems to matter for house prices. These two facts lead to global innovations in
uncertainty accounting for a significant amount of movements in the global component of house
prices for the G-7 countries. Third, the role that uncertainty plays in explaining house price movements
is more pronounced during the globalization period. This may be due to the fact that stock market
participation has increased over this period and that housing market has benefited from other vehicles
of financing (other than conventional mortgages).
Lastly, our finding that the increase in stock market uncertainty drives up house prices is likely
because when there is heightened uncertainty in a risky asset people resort to buying more of an asset
that is perceived to be relatively safer. For example, in currency markets during periods of global
crisis, investors move into the “safer” currency, which is the dollar. Is housing a safe asset? While
recent experience suggests otherwise, the empirical facts we report in the previous section find that
house prices are generally less volatile (or safer) than equity prices during the globalization period. It
would be natural then that in a time of uncertainty that the demand (and price) for houses would
increase because of the decline in demand for volatile equities. While we are unaware of micro level
evidence of this interpretation, we think that it is a result worth further exploration.
VI. Conclusion
We study house price fluctuations in advanced countries over the past four decades. We focus on two
specific questions. First, how synchronized are housing cycles across countries? Second, what are the
main shocks driving movements in global house prices?
To answer the first question, we present an extensive analysis of the degree of comovement of house
prices across countries using various metrics, including basic correlations, concordance indices, and
variance decompositions of national house prices into global and country-specific components. Our
analysis of basic correlations leads to following observations. First, house prices in advanced
economies tend to move together. Second, house prices have become more synchronized over time.
The degree of concordance of housing cycles has increased from 51 percent during the preglobalization period to more than 63 percent in the globalization period. Lastly, the fraction of variance
of house prices explained by the global house price factor has increased from about 20 percent during
the pre-globalization period to 35 percent in the era of globalization.
Next, we employ various FAVAR models to examine the main shocks driving global house price
fluctuations. To identify these shocks, we use two identification schemes commonly used in the
literatureʊa recursive method and a sign restriction method. The first method is useful to gain a better
understanding of the previous results in the literature and points to which structural shocks are likely to
matter. However, it does not allow us to assign a structural interpretation to our findings. The second
method relies on sign restrictions borrowed from a wide range of general equilibrium models and
allows us to draw structural interpretations from the results.
We report four major results about the sources of global house price fluctuations. First, global interest
rate shocks tend to have a significant effect on global house prices in most specifications when these

19
shocks are identified using a recursive scheme. This finding has led some observers to argue that the
use of monetary policy of low interest rates prior to the 2007-09 global financial crisis has been an
important driver of house prices in advanced economies, especially in the United States (Taylor, 2008).
However, it is not clear what drives interest rate movements when one simply relies on the recursive
identification. Are they market driven? Or are they the results of policy decisions by central banks?
To shed light on this issue, we turn to the identification of global monetary policy shocks with sign
restrictions. This brings us our second finding: global monetary policy shocks per se do not appear to
have a sizeable impact on global house price movements. In other words, monetary policy cannot be
the sole reason explaining the boom-bust behavior of house prices in advanced economies over the last
decade. In addition, considering our first finding, this result also implies that surprise movements in
interest rates that drive house prices cannot be exclusively explained by changes in monetary policy.
Third, neither productivity nor credit shocks appear to have a significant impact on house price
movements. Productivity shocks have a small impact on output, and shocks to output tend to have a
modest influence on the growth rate of house prices. These in turn imply that the role of productivity
shocks in explaining global house price movements is small. With respect to the minor role of credit
shocks, we argue that credit markets often function well and shocks stemming from these markets are
on average small. The implication is that shocks originating in credit markets have on average a small
impact on house prices. However, this result does not preclude the possibility that when there are
sizeable movements in creditʊduring periods of credit booms or crunches, for exampleʊcredit
market shocks can lead to significant fluctuations in house prices, as the global economy witnessed
over the past decade.
Last, but not the least, we find that uncertainty shocks tend to have a significant impact on global
house price movements. Specifically, one third of the global cycle in house prices can be attributed to
uncertainty shocks in the sample of G-7 countries. This is an economically large role for a single shock
to explain, and hence an important empirical fact. It is difficult to measure uncertainty because of its
latent nature. We employ a widely used measure here and consider the importance of uncertainty
shocks associated with the volatility of stock returns. From a mechanical perspective, uncertainty
series are highly correlated across countries implying that they have a significant common component.
This component appears to be important in explaining the common variation in house prices. Another
interpretation of our finding is that when the volatility of stock returns increases, agents appear to shift
their portfolio composition towards safer assets, such as housing. While housing may no longer be
perceived as a relatively safe asset by many, it was, at least for an extended period, before 2007.
Our results from various time-series models point to the necessity of a deeper study of sources of
house price movements. We consider four possible avenues for future research: First, it is important to
consider the roles played by a wider range of shocks in explaining house prices, including shocks
associated with fiscal and financial policies, in the context of time-series models with heterogeneity
and nonlinearities. This will require designing models that allow nonlinear feedback effects between
policy choices and interactions among the real economy, housing sector, and financial markets.
Second, although we provide preliminary evidence about the sources of common movements in house
prices, we do not articulate why house prices have become more synchronized over time. A natural
next topic to explore is a deeper analysis of differential effects of shocks and structural features of

20
countries, including their linkages through the banking system, on the temporal changes in the degree
of synchronization of house prices.
Third, we study the average impact of shocks on house prices over the past 40 years. It would
beneficial to go a step further and study how shocks affect house prices during certain episodes. For
example, one would expect that house prices respond differently to shocks during periods of
pronounced cycles in credit and housing markets, such as credit booms/crunches and house price
booms/busts. Understanding the dynamics of house prices during such episodes would require
designing counterfactuals to study the implications of the presence (or absence) of certain shocks
around these periods. Finally, it would also be useful to analyze the roles of these shocks using
dynamic stochastic multi-country general equilibrium models that can account for spillovers across
housing markets in different countries.

Notes: All statistics, except "Duration", correspond to sample medians. For "Duration", sample means are reported. Duration
for recessions is the number of quarters between peak and trough. Duration for recoveries is the number of quarters it takes to
attain the level of output at the previous peak. The amplitude for recessions is defined as the decline in output from the peak to
the trough. The amplitude for recoveries is the one year change in output after the trough. Cumulative loss combines
information about the duration and amplitude to measure the overall cost of a recession and is expressed in percent. The slope
of a recession is the amplitude from the peak to the trough divided by the duration. The slope of a recovery is the amplitude
from the trough to the period where output reached the level at its last peak, divided by the duration. Booms correspond to the
observations in the top 25 percent of upturns calculated by the amplitude. Busts correspond to the obsservations in the worst
25 percent of downturns calculated by the amplitude. Recessions, recoveries, housing busts and booms are identified
following Claessens, Kose, and Terrones (2012). ***, **, and * denote that recessions (recoveries) with house price busts
(booms) are significantly different than those without house price busts (booms) at 1 percent, 5 percent, and 10 percent levels,
respectively.

countries experiencing house price downturns, and the gray bars represent the years of global recessions
(1975, 1982, 1991, and 2009) and the preceding (1974, 1981, 2008) and succeeding (1992) periods.
Recessions and house price downturns are identified following Claessens, Kose, and Terrones (2012). At
the beginning and end of samples only complete episodes are included. The dates of global recessions are
from Kose, Loungani, and Terrones (2009).
