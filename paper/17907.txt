International Portfolio Diversification and Multilateral Effects of Correlations

NBER Working Paper No. 17907
March 2012, Revised December 2014
JEL No. F36,F41,G11,G15
ABSTRACT
Not only are investors biased toward home assets, but when they do invest abroad, they appear to favor
countries with returns more correlated with home assets. Often attributed to a preference for familiarity,
this ‘correlation puzzle’ further reduces effective diversification. However, a multi-country DSGE
model of portfolio choice makes clear that the effects of a bilateral stock return correlation must be
studied in the context of the full covariance structure. For example, the attractiveness of a foreign country
as a hedge depends upon its hedging potential relative to other potential destination countries. This
paper develops a new empirical approach based upon a multi-country theoretical model that controls
for the full covariance structure in a theoretically rigorous yet tractable manner. Estimation under this
approach overturns the correlation puzzle, and finds that international investors do seek the diversification
benefits of low cross-country correlations as theory would predict. Since covariances are central to
modern theories of portfolio choice, this empirical methodology should be useful also for other applications.

1. Introduction
Home bias in equities is a longstanding puzzle in international finance: investors on
average prefer to hold too large a share of their portfolios in domestic assets, given the
diversification benefits of assets abroad. 1 Further, even when investors diversify abroad,
evidence suggests that they prefer countries with a high correlation in returns to their home
country.2 Because a high correlation lowers diversification potential, this behavior compounds
investor losses from home bias. Some researchers have explained this second anomaly, termed
the ‘correlation puzzle,’ as a preference for familiarity when investing abroad.3
This paper argues that resolving the correlation puzzle requires a multi-country
perspective, both theoretically and empirically. General equilibrium asset-pricing models have
become widespread in international macro-finance research, with the development of higherorder approximation techniques.4 However, these models are generally two-country frameworks
which permit analysis of the first anomaly of home bias—whether to invest abroad—but do not
permit analysis of the second anomaly—where to invest abroad.5
The main theoretical implication of an N-country general equilibrium framework is that
the optimal share of country i’s portfolio in the assets of a foreign country j depends not just on
the correlation of returns between countries i and j, but also on the broader set of correlations
with other countries. Attempts to estimate the effect of the bilateral correlation on portfolio
shares must adequately control for the correlations with all other countries. As one example,

See Devereux and Sutherland (2011) and Tille and van Wincoop (2010) for a discussion of methodology, as well as
Engel and Matsumoto (2006), and Evans and Hnatkovska (2007) for applications. Stockman and Dellas (1989),
Obstfeld and Rogoff (2000), and Coeurdacier (2009) explain portfolio allocation with trade cost and non-tradable
goods. Martin and Rey (2004) and Heathcote and Perri (2004) show portfolio choice by invoking a transaction cost
or tax on international financial asset trade.
5
The few papers that model more than two countries in general equilibrium tend to assume the countries are
symmetric and have independent returns, such as Baxter, Jermann and King (1998), so these cannot study the choice
of investors between alternative destination countries. Okawa and van Wincoop (2012), discussed further below,
develop a multi-country model where financial frictions drive portfolio choice among countries. They also consider
an extension with a general covariance structure, but their focus is on the role of financial frictions rather than
heterogeneous correlations. Further they conclude that an estimable equation can be derived only for the special case
of zero cross-country correlations, which clearly precludes study of the “correlation puzzle.” The idea of considering
heterogeneous correlations across multiple assets or countries is longstanding in classic finance theory such as the
Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). However our model differs in key respects. CAPM presumes that investors
take a diversified portfolio, so that it only considers correlations of an asset with the diversified market portfolio. In
contrast, our model studies the choice among foreign assets in a context that is consistent with overall home bias in
the portfolio. Another key difference is that we take a general equilibrium approach in solving the portfolio model.

suppose the stock return correlation between France and Spain were higher than that between
New Zealand and Australia. One might predict less asset diversification between France and
Spain than between New Zealand and Australia, because the higher return correlation implies a
lower diversification benefit. However, it may be that France has even higher correlations with
the other countries surrounding it in Europe that would be an alternative to Spain for
diversification, so it might make sense for France to purchase assets in Spain because of the
relatively lower correlation compared to the alternatives. Hence, we may find a positive
relationship between stock return correlation and bilateral asset holdings when we focus on only
the bilateral relationship between country i and j without controlling for the correlations with
other countries.7
We use the N-country general equilibrium model to derive an estimation equation that
controls for the overall covariance structure in a theoretically rigorous yet tractable manner. The
idea is to extend the use of a second order Taylor approximation, widely used for dealing with
the nonlinear Euler equations in portfolio models, to take a second order approximation of the
overall portfolio solution as well. We choose for the point around which to construct the
approximation a point that exhibits symmetry across countries. It turns out that in this case the
proliferation of covariances implied by the covariance matrix in the portfolio solution of an N
country model collapses down to three key average covariances: the covariance between source
and destination country, the average covariance between source and other potential destination
countries, and the average covariance between the destination and other counties. This means
that the aspects of the full covariance matrix relevant to a second order approximation of the
portfolio solution can be summarized by adding three new covariance terms to the empirical
regression.
Estimates of coefficients in this equation provide a resolution to the correlation puzzle
above. In the absence of the recommended controls, where the only covariances included are the
bilateral covariances between source and destination, estimation reflects the puzzle by predicting
a preference for high correlations. But the sign in the bilateral correlation reverses when
including the other covariance terms recommended by our theoretical derivation. In particular,
controlling for the covariances with other potential destinations, investors prefer countries which

(2003, 2004) with respect to how trade costs affect trade flows.

offer the diversification benefits of low covariance with home equity returns. Our empirical
results are robust after controlling for other familiarity factors from previous literature, such as
distance, border, common language, etc, as well as controlling for legal restrictions on capital
market openness.
Our theoretical model is similar to that of Okawa and van Wincoop (2012), and we agree
with their critique of attempts to estimate with an ad hoc and incomplete specification of the
covariance structure. However, we go on to propose an empirical methodology that can satisfy
this critique and deal with correlations in a theoretically rigorous yet tractable manner. We hope
that this methodology also will be useful to other researchers. Covariances are central to modern
theories of portfolio choice, and the correlation puzzle we study provides one example where
international covariances are essential to the problem, and where an empirical methodology to
deal with them clearly is needed.
Coeurdacier and Guibaud (2011) offer an alternative explanation for the correlation
puzzle, based upon the endogeneity of correlations. Our results are robust to controlling for
endogeneity, and also suggest the two explanations are complementary.8
Section 2 introduces the N country portfolio choice model with full covariance structure
and presents simulations of a 3-country version of the model for intuition. It also derives the
theoretically-based empirical equation. Section 3 describes data, with empirical results presented
in section 4. Concluding remarks follow.

2. Theory
2.1. An N country, N+1 Asset Model
The model builds upon the two-country model of Devereux and Sutherland (2011), but
expands to an N-country setting, with non-zero covariance structure on incomes. Consider a
consumer’s dynamic optimization problem below.

8

While the instrumental variable approach of Coeurdacier and Guibaud (2011) is effective in resolving the puzzle in
their results, we find that this explanation is sensitive to the specification of the instrument as non-time varying. An
alternative but also conventional specification of the instrument using one-period lags of the correlation does not
effectively resolve the puzzle on its own. Further, the instrument used in Coeurdacier and Guibaud, a non-time
varying correlation from a period before the sample, resembles the country-pair fixed effects in some of our
specifications, which our theoretical derivation shows may also indirectly help control for multilateral effects of
correlations.

We assume a risk-free bond in the same manner of Okawa and van Wincoop (2012). This assumption can be
justified by the existence of nearly risk-free assets such as insured bank deposits or government bonds. Above all,
the assumption is useful to derive an empirical specification for equity holdings. Without the risk-free asset as an
anchor asset, the optimal equity holdings would depend additively on the expected returns on all equity, thus making
it harder to derive a simple form of empirical specification. Note that our real risk-free bond is not related to
exchange rate risk. While a bond is used to allow for hedging exchange rate risk in recent studies, Coeurdacier and
Gourinchas (2011) argue that equity holdings are not driven by real exchange rate risk, and Engel and Matsumoto
(2009) show similar results in a specific model with nominal rigidities.

Previous studies such as Kang and Stulz (1997) and van Nieuwerburgh and Veldkamp
(2009) emphasized the role of information asymmetry on portfolio choice. We follow Okawa
and van Wincoop (2012), and introduce this information friction into risk factor (variance of
returns). Domestic agents are more informed than foreigners about idiosyncratic payoff
‘innovations’ on domestic equity claims due to differences in language and financial system. So,
from the perspective of agents in country i considering an asset in a foreign country j,  i,t has a
mean of 0 and variance  ij jj where  ij  1 . Equity home bias in our model arises from this
information asymmetry.
Combine FOCs on N assets for country i, and write them in terms of the excess return of
country j’s asset, ( R j ,t  R f ,t )

where a risk-free bond, f is used as a numeraire, so ( RN ,t  R f ,t ) measures the “excess return” on

From N equations of (6’) for country i, we make pairs between country i and k, and derive
N ( N  1) equations like below
Et [(Cˆ i ,t 1  Cˆ k ,t 1 )( Rˆ j ,t 1  Rˆ f ,t 1 )]  0 for j=1,…,N, and i, k=1,…N, k≠i.

(10)

The first order accurate solution for (Cˆ i ,t 1  Cˆ k ,t 1 ) is also straightforward to derive from (2’).
Substitute it into (10), and the first-order accurate behavior of Rˆ j ,t 1  Rˆ f ,t 1 is particularly simple
in this model. First-order approximations of (4) and (5) imply Rˆ j ,t 1  Rˆ f ,t 1  Yˆ j ,t 1  O( 2 ) (See
Appendix A).
Hence, the distribution of first order components of excess equity returns follows that of first

Based on equation (10), we construct a matrix system to express the equity holdings (See
Appendix B).
Α  B

Α   1 B .

(11)

where A is an N 2  1 vector of equity holdings, B is an N 2  1 vector which consists of the
variance and covariance of the excess stock returns, and  is an N 2  N 2 matrix (see Appendix B
for a representation of the  matrix).
While a full analytical solution to this system is not possible, (11) makes clear our main
point that portfolio holdings in ( A ) depend upon the full set of covariances among all countries,
contained in the inverse of the full covariance matrix (  1 ), rather than just the bilateral
covariance of a given source country and a given destination country. This point will be
demonstrated further below.

2.2. Numerical Simulations

Given that the system with general covariances is too complex to support analytical
solutions, we demonstrate some key properties of the solution using numerical experiments.
Consider a three country version of the model (N=3). See Appendix C for an explanation of the
full model solution.
The input to the simulation consists of information asymmetry parameter, τi and a 3×3
covariance matrix among capital returns across countries, 33 . For illustration, we assume a
uniform unit variance for all assets, and a uniform expected return for all assets, and choose
values of the information cost τ =1.3 when j≠i, τ =1 when j=i. The output consists of the 3×3
~
transformed equity share matrix, Α33 . To help provide economic intuition, define each
7

~
component of matrix Α33 as the ratio of country j’s equities held by country i to total equities of

country i (

 ji
  ji ), where  Yi is the total value of equity of country i (i=1,2,3) in our
 Yi

simulations. We add 1 (endowment itself) to the domestic equity holdings; thus, the sum of
equity holdings of each country is equal to 1.

The simulation illustrates three key properties of the portfolio solution. First, the bilateral
equity holding between two countries is positively affected by a fall in the bilateral stock return
correlation. This property is apparent when comparing cases (i) and (ii) in the table above in
regard to the relationship of countries 1 and 2: a fall in the correlation  12 from 0.8 to 0.6 raises
equity holdings Α33 (1, 2) from 0.154 to 0.246. A second lesson is that a bilateral equity holding
between two countries is negatively affected by a fall in the bilateral stock return correlation of
one of the countries with a third country. This property is apparent when comparing cases (ii)
and (iii) in the table above: a fall in the correlation between countries 1 and 3 from 0.4 to 0
lowers the equity holdings between countries 1 and 2 from 0.246 to 0.14. Combining these two
experiments and comparing case (i) to (iii) illustrates the main claim of the paper, that bilateral
asset shares can appear to violate the first lesson above, so that higher correlations sometimes are
associated with higher rather than lower asset holdings. But these cases reflect third country
effects, and they are still consistent with a portfolio that maximizes hedging benefits. Finally, we

8

note that the degree of home bias12 (represented in element Α33 (1,1) ) affected the full set of
international correlations in this model: an improvement in the opportunities for diversification
as represented by a fall in one or more bilateral correlations leads to a fall in the degree of home
bias in home equities.
Finally, we summarize a more comprehensive set of simulations of the 3-country model
to more broadly characterize the partial derivatives of portfolio share with respect to bilateral and
third-country correlations. 13 Figure 1 reports the derivatives of the portfolio share held by
country 1 of country 2 equities with respect to the covariance of bilateral returns between
countries 1 and 2 and the third-country covariance between country 1 and 3. As in the
simulations above, we calibrate   1.3 , but we consider a range of values for the covariance

country (

21

2.3. Derivation of Estimation Equation

The theoretical model makes clear that an empirical equation explaining bilateral equity
holdings should account not just for the covariance between source and destination country, but
also the broader covariance structure. However, the matrix algebra for portfolios in equation (11)
of an N country model does not produce a linear empirical specification for equity asset
holdings.14 We derive an estimable equation by taking a second order Taylor approximation.
Given that a second order approximation was already employed to derive the Euler equation (6’)

12

For present purposes we define the term home bias as the degree to which the share of home assets in the home
portfolio exceeds the share of home market capitalization in the world market.
13
Analytical derivatives are not possible in our N-country general equilibrium setting. In contrast with the model of
Coeurdacier and Guibaud (2011), third-country correlations affect also the degree of overall home bias, which
complicates the task of assigning a sign to partial derivatives. While we are able to generate analytical expressions
for these derivatives with the aid of computer software, the expressions are extremely long and impossible to sign,
even in the case of N=3.
14
As shown in Okawa and van Wincoop (2012), a model with a general covariance structure does not imply an
estimation equation that is a true gravity equation, in which bilateral asset holdings are the product of country
specific variables and a bilateral friction.

9

used in constructing (11), taking a second order Taylor approximation of the resulting equation
(11) is a simple extension of this methodology, and is a logical approach to deriving a reasonable
approximation to the theory that both captures the key predictions and is amenable to estimation.
The equity share solution for a source country i in an N-country world is written as

This puts our left hand side variable in the usual units of the dependent variable from previous

empirical studies of the correlation puzzle, which will facilitate comparison of our results with
the existing literature. Now consider the equity holdings of the source country i in a particular
destination country j,

Next, take a second-order Taylor approximation of (13) with respect to all terms. For the
point around which we construct the approximation, we choose a point where all countries are

10

symmetric, so that, Rˆk  Rˆ f , Y ,  ,  ii   ,  ij   (for i, j=1,…N), respectively. As derived in
Appendix E, the second order approximation is written:

 ji    D  Et ( Rˆi  Rˆ f )  E  Et ( Rˆ j  Rˆ f )  F   Et ( Rˆk  Rˆ f )  G  ii  I   jj  J    kk

where D , E , F , G , I , J , K , L , P and Q are coefficients that are functions of covariances of
returns evaluated at the point of approximation (see the specific formula of each coefficient in
Appendix E).
Note that the equity holdings indeed depend on the full covariance structure, in that all
variances and covariances in the covariance matrix i appear. A convenient property of
constructing the Taylor approximation around a point of symmetry is that the various
covariances can be grouped into four categories, each of which is multiplied by the same
coefficient in the Taylor approximation. The first is the covariance between source country i and
destination j,  ij , In the empirical equation (15) below, this regressor will be labeled EQCOVij,
and is of particular interest in our estimation. Appendix E provides a proof that the theoretical
model implies the coefficient on this regressor should be negative.
The second set of regressors are the covariances between the source country i and
countries other than j, ik .While each of these N-2 covariances can differ from each other, the
fact we evaluate the Taylor approximation coefficient at a point of symmetry means that each of
these covariances is multiplied by the same coefficient, which we label as L in equation (14).
See appendix E for a proof of this claim, as well as the analogous claims for the other groups of
regressors. This means we can sum up these covariances and factor out the common coefficient.
In our estimation equation (15) below, this summation of covariances becomes a regressor we
label as MTij, representing “multilateral effects” of covariances in alternative destinations. A
large value for MTij indicates that there is a high correlation of returns between country i and all
other countries other than j. So, it is expected that this MT term is positively associated with
bilateral financial asset holdings between countries i and j. Appendix E provides a proof that the
theoretical model implies the coefficient on this regressor should be positive.
11

The third group of regressors are the covariances between the destination country j and
countries other than i,  jl . Appendix E again shows that even while these individual covariances
will differ from each other, they take the same coefficient in the Taylor approximation and
therefore can be summed up to form a regressor with a common coefficient. This regressor we
label DTij, representing “destination” effects. As shown in Appendix E, the theoretical model
implies an ambiguous sign for this regressor.
Fourth are covariances between countries other than i and j. Again these (N-2)2
covariances will differ from each other in value, but they can be summed together as a single
regressor, which while label as OTij, representing “other” country effects. As shown in Appendix
E, the theoretical model implies an ambiguous sign for this regressor.
To summarize, we rewrite the equity holdings solution (14) to form the estimation
equation:
Equityij    1 EQCOVij   2Vari   3Varj   4 MTij   5 DTij   6OTij
  7 ERi  8 ER j  Tij     ij

(15)

Each term in this estimation equation corresponds to a term in the theoretical equation
(14) above. In addition to the composite covariance regressors discussed above, the regressors
Vari and Varj are the names we assign to the variances of returns terms  ii and  jj in (14). The

regressors ERi and ERj are the names we assign to the expected excess returns terms Et ( Rˆi  Rˆ f )
and Et ( Rˆ j  Rˆ f ) in (14). The dependent variable, Equityij , is the log of equity holdings. 15
Lastly, we note that if one sums the four composite regressors, it becomes the sum of all
elements in the covariance matrix. This will be the same for all country pairs, and implies a
colinearity problem. If the values of 3 variables out of the 4 variables, EQCOVij, MTij, DTij, and
OTij, are known, the value of any fourth variable is determined and the information on the fourth

variable is redundant. Thus, in the regression analysis, we need to control for any 3 variables
among the 4 variables, and we therefore will drop OTij. This also applies to Vari, Varj and the
15

We take a log of equity holdings for scaling, which also makes our depending variable directly comparable to that
usually used in the related empirical literature. This is easily incorporated in the Taylor approximation by writing the
dependent variable as exp(log(  ji )) before taking derivatives. This simply introduces a constant factor of

1/  which is included in each of the constants

D , E , F , G , I , J, K, L, P , and , Q in the equation (14).

vector T of common regressors, including distance, border, common language, etc.

3. Data and Measurement

This section discusses how data are used to measure the regressors in the estimation
equation (15) above.

3.1 Main Variables

Data for the bilateral portfolio equity holdings, the dependent variable, come from the
Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS) published by the International Monetary Fund
(IMF). The survey has been conducted annually since 2001 (and for the first time in 1997). The
first CPIS involved 29 source economies, while the CPIS has expanded participation up to 73
source economies in 2006, including several offshore and financial centers. In each case, the
bilateral positions of the source countries in 218 destination countries/territories are reported.
The CPIS provides a breakdown of a country’s stock of portfolio investment assets by
country of residence of issuer. Lee (2008) and Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2008) point out the
shortcomings of survey methods and under-reporting of assets by participating countries (See the
details in Lane and Milesi-Ferretti 2008). Nevertheless, the survey presents a unique opportunity
to examine foreign equity and debt holdings of many participating countries. We choose bilateral
equity holdings for 2006 and take a log.17

N

16

The results with the sum of third country’s variances (



k i , j

kk

) do not change our main message. The results are

available from the authors upon request.
Equity holdings are reported in terms of millions of U.S. dollars. A unit is converted from millions to thousands.
All values are real: we convert nominal value into real term using US GDP deflator (2005=100).
17

13

We introduce equity return and stock market capitalization variables. The stock market
capitalization variable is constructed by taking a log of product of source and destination
countries’ market capitalization divided by world market capitalization. Domestic stock market
capitalization data is available from the Global Financial Database. The measure for equity
return variance-covariance (or correlation) of 49 countries (21 advanced countries and 28
emerging and developing countries: see Appendix F for the list of countries) is constructed using
stock price indices collected from the DataStream. We compute annual equity return variancecovariance over preceding 4-years from 2006, for each country pair, using bilateral monthly
return data.18
To demonstrate robustness, we use the alternative measures, equity return correlation
(EQSYNC) and output co-movement (SYNC)19 (see Portes and Rey, 2005, and Lane and MilesiFerretti, 2008, which also utilize both equity return correlation and output correlation). Either
measure is consistent with our theoretical endowment economy model where the distribution of
first order components of excess equity returns follows that of output. We also construct the
multilateral correlation term using both measures: for each country pair i and j, we sum the

3.3. Other Controls

We include other important determinants (T) of bilateral equity asset holdings identified
by previous literature, including specific geographical, political and cultural factors. To control
for explicit barriers to international equity investment, we consider a country’s equity market
liberalization index based on Bekaert and Harvey (2004) and Bekaert, Harvey, and Lundblad
(2005). Official equity market liberalization indicator is coded as 1 when a country’s equity
market is officially liberalized—foreign investors officially have the opportunity to invest in
domestic equity securities—and zero otherwise. We construct bilateral equity market
18

The reason why using the preceding 4 years data (48 monthly observations, 2003-2006) for equity covariance is to
make avoid extraordinary crisis events that may result in abnormal equity correlation or equity flow patterns, such as
Latin America economic crisis in the early 2000s (2001-2002) and Asian Financial crisis in the late 1990s (19971998). In addition, previous study such as Longin and Solnik (1995) presented equity return correlation computed
using a 4 year rolling window.
19
EQSYNC is also computed over preceding 4-years with bilateral monthly return data and SYNC is using preceding
10-years real GDP data from Penn World Table.

liberalization indicator by multiplying each equity market indicator in a country pair.20 However,
in our sample of 2006, equity markets of most developed and emerging economies are
categorized as ‘officially liberalized’ and the measure has not much cross-sectional variation in
2006 (The mean of the measure is about 0.9). Thus, for the robustness of the results, we
introduce the alternative measures of capital account openness proposed by Quinn (1997) and
Quinn and Toyoda (2008) and Chinn and Ito (2006) respectively and construct bilateral measure
by multiplication.21
To measure geographical proximity, we use two variables from Rose and Spiegel (2004):
(i) the log of bilateral distance between countries and (ii) a binary variable indicating a shared
border. To control for cultural and historical affinities between countries that can affect crossborder asset holdings, we add binary variables for common language, for country pairs with a
history of colonization, and for common colonizer. Common language may lower information
costs between countries, so investors can more easily access each other’s financial market. The
same colonial experience may predict more familiar financial institutions in another country.
We include indicators for currency unions as they may decrease transaction costs and
also remove risk from exchange rate volatility (Coeurdacier and Martin, 2009). Previous studies
introduce a time zone difference dummy to proxy for communication difficulties when the
overlap between office hours is limited (Portes and Rey, 2005 and Lane and Milesi-Ferretti
2008). We include the difference in longitude between countries to measure time difference,
where the data is from the CIA World Fact book.
Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2008) find that OECD countries and emerging market countries
differed in the factors determining the pattern of equity investments. So we add an OECD
dummy variable coded as 1 if two countries in a pair are both OECD members. This variable
also control for income level and development of financial institution of a country pair. A

20

We include not only bilateral equity market liberalization but also each country’s equity market liberalization
separately in our regression. Both ways of controls do not affect our main results.
21
The results with Quinn’s measure and Chinn and Ito’s measure are consistent with our main results and are
available from the authors upon request. Quinn (1997) constructs a measure by taking into account severity of
restrictions balancing across all categories of financial transaction from AREAER, IMF. The measure is scored 0–4,
in half integer units and the maximum value of 4 represents an economy fully open to capital flows. The data are
available for 95 countries for 1940-2004. Chinn and Ito (2006) also creates a measure based on three financial
current binary indicators in the AREAER. Their measure takes the value of 2.44 if countries are “most financially
open” while it takes score of -1.86 for the “least financial open” countries. So when we make bilateral measure, we
add 2 before multiplying by countries’ measures in a country pair. The data are available for 1970-2011 for 182
countries.

15

variable of common legal origin indicates if both source and destination countries have a legal
system from the same origin; English (Common), French, German or Scandinavian law.
Common legal origin is likely to lead to similar institutions, regulation and custom for financial
transaction between countries. The information on legal origins is from the Rose and Spiegel
dataset. We also follow Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2008) and Coeurdacier and Guibaud (2011) in
including an indicator variable if the source and destination countries have a tax treaty enacted
prior to 2001 and in force until 2006.22
Lastly, we include a log of bilateral trade (sum of imports and exports between countries)
divided by the sum of GDPs between two countries in line with Aviat and Coeurdacier (2007)
and Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2008).23 We report summary statistics and correlation of variables
in Appendix G.

4. Empirical Results
4.1. Main Results

The coefficient estimates reported in the first three columns of Table 1 convey our main
message. Column (1) shows that we reproduce the basic puzzle identified in past research: the
estimated coefficient on international equity returns covariance (EQCOV) is significantly
positive at the 10% critical level. Despite the theoretical benefits of diversifying the composition
of the foreign portfolio, investors seem to prefer countries with fluctuations in returns that are
similar to their home country. However, the result is completely transformed once we control for
the full covariance structure by including the multilateral effects (MT) term and the destination
effect term (DT) of returns covariance, which captures returns covariance with the multilateral
partners. Column (2) shows that the estimated coefficient of EQCOV becomes significantly
negative at the 5% critical level. Thus, we confirm that a higher return covariance lowers
bilateral equity asset holdings once we adequately take into consideration covariances with third
countries. Furthermore, the estimated coefficient of MT term is significantly positive, as our
theory would predict.

22

This control varies by country pair. The data are available from the IBFD Tax Treaty Database
(http://www.ibfd.org).
23
Our trade intensity measure reflects trade relationships between countries that are not induced by countries sizes.
Moreover, using other trade measures such as log of bilateral trade or log of trade over product of GDP does not
affect our main results.

16

Column (3) includes more variables that represent frictions across countries in terms of
geography, language, culture, and also countries’ real economic linkage such as trade in goods
and services that previous studies considered. Also we control for legal barriers to equity market
investment (equity market liberalization index). Column (3) shows that the estimated coefficient
of EQCOV is still positive and of similar magnitude as in column (1) but statistically
insignificant. Column (4) supports our main message. Further addition of our MT and DT
controls in column (4) makes the estimated coefficient of EQCOV become negative and
statistically significant at the 1% critical level as well as larger in magnitude. Hence, controlling
for the full covariance structure in the regression contributes to resolving the correlation puzzle.
Throughout columns (1)-(4) in Table 1, other standard explanatory variables have the expected
signs. Countries’ stock market capitalizations have a positive effect on bilateral equity holdings.
Higher asset holdings are associated with higher equity returns in both countries, as are common
language, colonial relationship, tax treaty and currency union. Distance has a negative effect.
Bilateral asset holding is found to be positively influenced by bilateral trade intensity.
Column (5) shows that our results on EQCOV are preserved if we expand the sample by
defining the dependent variable as ln(equity+1), to prevent observations from dropping when
taking a log of zeroes.24 We implement tobit estimation to consider left censored observations of
the dependent variable, including MT and DT terms. The estimated coefficient of EQCOV is
significantly negative at the 1% critical level. Also most of the estimated coefficients remain as
the same as those of column (4) but the effect of equity liberalization index turns out to be
significantly positive.25

4.2. An Instrumental Variable Approach

The empirical investigation of the effects of equity returns covariance on equity asset
holdings may encounter an endogeneity problem, as discussed in Coeurdacier and Guibaud
(2011). The causality can run in the opposite direction: financial asset holdings between
countries (financial integration) may have either a negative or a positive effect on equity returns
correlation. Hence, the former estimates of equity returns covariance on bilateral asset holdings
might be biased. As a robustness check, this section implements an instrument variable (IV)
24

Our equity holdings are measured in thousands of US dollars. So, 1 means a thousand US dollar.
To check the robustness of the result, we implement the same analysis with alternative samples for 2001-2005.
The results are qualitatively similar to those in Table 1. See the additional Appendix.
25

17

approach, using past information on equity return correlation as an instrument, as suggested by
Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2008) and Coeurdacier and Guibaud (2011).
Panel B of Table 2 presents the first stage regression of IV. We instrument EQCOV on its
lagged information. The estimated coefficient of our instruments on current returns covariance
(EQCOV) is reported in Panel B. F-test statistics on the first stage regression all exceed the
critical values at 10% maximal IV size which is 22.4 for weak instruments as reported by Stock
and Yogo (2002). Thus, we can reject the null hypothesis that the IV equation is weakly
identified and confirm that the instrument variables are statistically powerful. We also find no
evidence of an over-identification problem. The joint-null hypothesis for the over-identification
test—which implies that instruments are uncorrelated with the error term—cannot be rejected.
The p-values of Hansen J-statistics in both IV regressions of Table 2 support the exogeneity
hypothesis of our instruments.
Panel A of Table 2 reports estimates from the second stage instrumental variable
regressions, beginning with a specification drawn from column (2) of Table 1. Results confirm
the conclusions from previous tables. Comparing columns (1) and (2) shows that once again
including our control for MT and DT terms confers statistical significance (at the 1% level) to the
negative relationship between equity holdings and equity returns covariance (EQCOV). And
once again, we show that our results with full covariance terms are robust to controlling for
endogeneity.
4.3. Measure for Returns Correlation: Equity Return and Output Co-movement26

To reinforce the robustness of the results, we repeated our estimation while replacing
equity return covariance (EQCOV) with the alternative measures, equity return correlation
(EQSYNC) and output co-movement (SYNC). Previous studies consider equity return correlation
as a determinant of bilateral asset holdings, so we report the results with equity return correlation
for a comparative purpose. We also use output correlation instead of equity return correlation as
another alternative measure. An advantage of the output measure is that it is available for a much

26

More robustness checks considering country pair and time panel structure are reported in Bergin and Pyun (2012).

18

wider set of countries, doubling the sample size (see Appendix F for the list of countries in the
sample). 27
Table 3 shows the estimation results which correspond to the results of Tables 1 and 2.
In column (1), we reproduce the correlation puzzle again without considering full covariance
structure. However further addition of our MTEQSYNC and DTEQSYNC controls in columns (3) and (4)
confers statistical significance (at the 1% level) to the negative relationship between equity
holdings and equity returns correlations (EQSYNC). Moreover, IV regressions in columns (5)
and (6) of Table 3 again supports our main message. The estimated coefficient of EQSYNC starts
as positive in column (1) despite controlling for endogeneity and becomes significantly negative
once we control for multilateral effects of returns correlation (MTEQSYNC) and the correlations
among destination countries (DTEQSYNC) in column (6). Note that our IV regressions pass the tests
for weak instruments and over-identification.28
Table 4 shows that the results with SYNC are consistent overall with our baseline results
with EQSYNC. Hence, we confirm that a higher return correlation indeed lowers bilateral equity
asset holdings once we adequately control for return correlations with multilateral partners.

5. Concluding Remarks

This paper studies how asset diversification between a pair of countries is affected by
correlations with third countries. Our N-country theoretical framework offers one explanation for
why recent empirical work has found that higher return correlations are sometimes associated
with higher portfolio holdings, which is contrary to the pursuit of risk hedging. Because bilateral
asset holdings depend not only upon bilateral stock return correlation with the destination
country but on the full covariance structure, the attractiveness of a foreign country as a hedge
27

The finance literature has established the empirical relationship between stock returns and production growth rates
(Fama, 1990, and Schwert, 1990, for the U.S., and Choi, Hauser, and, Kopecky, 1999, for G-7 countries). For
instance, the model of simple discounted cash flow valuation maintains that stock prices reflect investors’
expectations about the future real economic variables such as corporate earnings, or its aggregate proxy, industrial
production. If these expectations are correct on average, lagged stock returns should be correlated with the
contemporaneous growth rate of industrial production. So, another benefit of using output growth correlation is that
we avoid a simultaneity problem between stock return correlation and bilateral stock holdings because output comovement is highly correlated with the lagged stock return correlation.
28
Instruments are a year lagged EQSYNC, 4 year lagged EQSYNC, and a year lagged EQSYNC growth. F-test
statistics on the first stage regressions of columns (5) and (6) are above the critical values at 10% maximal IV size
for weak instruments as reported by Stock and Yogo (2002). This implies that our first stage has good power and
instruments are not weak. We also find no evidence of an over-identification problem. The p-values of Hansen J
statistics in both IV regressions support the exogeneity hypothesis of our instruments.

19

depends upon its hedging potential relative to other potential destination countries. The model
suggests a means for controlling for third-country effects, and empirical specifications
implementing these controls reverse this finding of preceding literature. This issue illustrates an
advantage of taking a multi-country perspective in modeling bilateral asset holdings.

Appendix
A. The first-order accurate behavior of ( Rˆ j ,t 1  Rˆ f ,t 1 )

Rˆ j ,t 1  Rˆ f ,t 1  Yˆ j ,t 1  Zˆ Ej ,t  Zˆ Bj ,t  O( 2 ) .
where O( 2 ) is a residual which contains all terms of order higher than one, so

Et ( Rˆ j ,t 1  Rˆ f ,t 1 )  Et (Yˆ j ,t 1 )  Zˆ Ej ,t  Zˆ Bj ,t  O( 2 ) .
The return on equities must equal to each other, up to a first-order approximation. Moreover, first
components of the equity return and bond return are assumed to be equal,

Et ( Rˆ i ,t 1  Rˆ f ,t 1 )  0 , so
Zˆ Ej ,t  Zˆ Bj ,t  Et (Yˆ j ,t 1 )  O( 2 ) where Et (Yˆ j ,t 1 )  0 .
Therefore, Rˆ j ,t 1  Rˆ f ,t 1  Yˆ j ,t 1  O( 2 )

B. Solving for the portfolio holdings, equations (10) and (11)
(10) Et [(Cˆ i ,t 1  Cˆ k ,t 1 )( Rˆ j ,t 1  Rˆ f ,t 1 )]  0 for i,j=1,…N, and k=2,…,N, k≠i

The value of each component, a,b,c,d, in the inverse covariance matrix is a function of

The leading principal minor of the inverse matrix (when   1 ) is positive ( a2  b2  0 )
due to the property of positive definite matrix, and a  0  a  b  0
b) When    , b( ),c( ), d ( )  0 except for a( ) based on the inverse matrix
