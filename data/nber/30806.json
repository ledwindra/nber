    "abstract": "\n\nOil and gas lease negotiations provide mineral owners the opportunity to negotiate for both compensation and clauses that may protect their health and the enjoyment of their properties. We use optical character recognition to assemble the most comprehensive dataset to date on royalty rates and clauses in nearly 60,000 leases signed in Pennsylvania\u2019s Marcellus Shale. We leverage our data to produce three descriptive findings. First, we find a positive relationship between royalty rates and the prevalence of protective clauses. Second, we find that as development of the shale play progressed over time, royalty rates rose and leases became more likely to contain several protective clauses. Third, we find that royalty rates and the presence of protective clauses bear a weak relationship with the geologic productivity of nearby wells, explained by few firms competing in geographically segregated leasing markets. Some leases simultaneously containing higher royalty rates and more protective clauses suggests that there is a bargaining surplus in leasing markets, but the division of this surplus does not depend on the productivity of the mineral estate. Instead, it may reflect differing preferences, as well as differing negotiating skills, legal resources, and access to information. By documenting 43 clauses found in shale leases and their prevalence\u2014more than double the number identified in past research\u2014we provide critical information that can help mineral owners overcome information asymmetries and increase transparency and equity in leasing markets.\n\n",
