ABSTRACT
The recent expansion of health-plan choice has been touted as increasing competition and enabling
people to choose plans that fit their needs. This study provides new evidence challenging these proposed
benefits of expanded health-insurance choice. We examine health-insurance decisions of employees
at a large U.S. firm where a new plan menu included a large share of financially dominated options.
This menu offers a unique litmus test for evaluating choice quality since standard risk preferences
and beliefs about one’s health cannot rationalize enrollment into the dominated plans. We find that
a majority of employees – and in particular, older workers, women, and low earners – chose dominated
options, resulting in substantial excess spending. Most employees would have fared better had they
instead been enrolled in the single actuarially-best plan. In follow-up hypothetical-choice experiments,
we observe similar choices despite far simpler menus. We find these choices reflect a severe deficit
in health insurance literacy and naïve considerations of health risk and price, rather than a sensible
comparison of plan value. Our results challenge the standard practice of inferring risk attitudes and
assessing welfare from insurance choices, and raise doubts whether recent health reforms will deliver
their promised benefits.

Across the many financial decisions facing Americans, those involving health insurance are
among the most economically consequential and poorly understood. A majority of insured Americans
worry that unexpected health expenses pose a threat to a secure retirement and financial well-being, but
only 14% of the insured are able to define the basic cost-sharing concepts fundamental to most health
insurance plans (Loewenstein et al. 2013). 1 This lack of health-insurance literacy mattered less when most
individuals simply accepted the single-plan offered by their employer, Medicare, or Medicaid, but in recent
years there has been a trend towards providing individuals with greater choice. Seniors select from
numerous and highly differentiated plan options when enrolling in Medicare Part D or Medicare
Advantage, and the median enrollee on the exchanges of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) chooses from
47 available plans. In theory, choice should improve consumer welfare both by enhancing the ability of
individuals to sort into suitable plans and by encouraging provider competition. As Kathleen Sebelius,
former Secretary of Health and Human Services, stated during the rollout of the ACA exchanges,
“Exchanges offer Americans competition, choice, and clout. Insurance companies will compete for
business on a transparent, level playing field, driving down costs, and Exchanges will give individuals…
a choice of plans to fit their needs.”
However, recent research has challenged the economic rationale for expanding health-plan choice
by questioning whether consumers can sensibly navigate the choices they face. A series of influential
studies established that seniors make poor decisions about drug coverage on the highly complex Medicare
Part D exchanges. Abaluck and Gruber (2011) conclude that a majority of enrollees could have selected
alternative plans with both lower premiums and lower variance in cost suggesting widespread inefficiency
in choice. 2 Kling et al (2012) find that providing seniors with simple information on the expected
spending associated with different plans led to substantial plan switching, implying that seniors had not
previously compared the financial value of different plans. Seniors do reduce excess spending over time
(Ketcham, et al. 2012), but appear to exhibit considerable inertia when it comes to changing plans
(Ericson, forthcoming). Outside the complicated domain of Medicare, most evidence on the quality of
plan choice has been limited to the problem of consumer inertia. Inertia in plan choice has been
documented in employee populations (Strombom et al. 2002; Frank and Lamiraud, 2009), and Handel
(2013) reports cases in which this inertia leaves employees with substantially dominated plans. Assessing
the quality of active employee choices from straightforward plan menus has been more challenging since

these choices reflect factors such as a tolerance for risk and expectations regarding future medical care
that are not readily observed by researchers.
In this paper, we present new evidence on the quality of insurance plan choices made by over
50,000 employees of a large US firm. Employees in our sample were required to assemble their own
health plan by selecting options for four cost-sharing dimensions (deductible, out-of-pocket maximum,
copay and coinsurance). The resulting “build-your-own” menu featured 48 plans which varied in costsharing and premium but were otherwise equivalent.
The decisions faced by these employees provide a unique litmus test for assessing the quality of
health plan choices, due to two key features. The first key feature is that the majority of the plan options
were financially dominated by other available plans. That is, employees chose from a menu in which some
plans were less costly regardless of the employee’s ultimate level of medical care. A menu with a
significant share of financially dominated options can reveal choice quality without assumptions about
consumer beliefs or risk preferences. As an illustration of plan dominance, employees shopping for
single-person coverage who had the choice of four deductibles ($1000; $750; $500; $250) typically had to
pay more than $500 to reduce their deductible from $1,000 to $750, holding all other plan features
equivalent. This price difference cannot be rationalized by any level of health-care utilization since the
employee could save at most $250 with the lower deductible. 3 Of the 36 low-deductible plans available,
35 were dominated in this way. The second key feature is the fact that the plans, apart from varying
across the four cost-sharing dimensions and premium, were otherwise identical and were presented in a
highly standardized manner. The plans were provided by the same health insurance company (eliminating
possible differences in provider reputation) and featured the same coverage in- and out-of- network. As
a result of these two features, the apparent dominance of plans should not have been confounded by
actual, or perceived, differences in other plan attributes, and the identification of such dominance should
not have required extraordinary consumer sophistication.
Our main empirical result is that the majority of employees chose plans that were financially
dominated. 4 The economic consequences of these poor choices for those who made them were
significant. The average employee opting into a dominated plan could have saved $373 per year by
choosing an otherwise equivalent plan with a higher deductible, which is equivalent to 2% of mean annual
income and 42% of the average employee-paid premium.

Choice quality varies by employee

While we focus on employees choosing single coverage plans, we find that choices of other employees are similar.
61% chose a transparently dominated plan before tax considerations, while 55% chose a dominated plan adjusting for the differential tax
deductibility of premiums over out-of-pocket spending.

characteristics: Lower-income employees, female employees, older employees, and employees with
chronic health conditions were all significantly more likely to select dominated contracts. Indicative of
the welfare consequences of these choices, employees in the lowest band of reported income could have
saved over 4% of annual income, on average, with the actuarially best plan. This evidence suggests that
the burden of complex insurance decisions may disproportionately affect the most financially vulnerable.
We also find, consistent with prior studies documenting consumer inertia, that only a modest share of
employees switched into new plans the subsequent year. While the plurality of these switchers moved to
financially superior plans, switching rates were lower for low-income employees.
Given the financial consequences of plan choice, why do so many employees choose dominated
plans? One possibility is that sophisticated employees knowingly pay a premium for the ease and
predictability of incurring steady payroll deductions as compared to a more variable flow of out-of-pocket
expenses. However, for the 36% of employees choosing the mid-level $500 deductible, such preferences
imply paying an additional $625 in premiums to avoid an expected marginal increase of $230 in out-ofpocket expenses, and a maximum of $500 in such expenses, over the course of the year. While we cannot
definitely rule out this explanation, given the availability of alternative sources of financing available to
most employees (e.g., flexible savings accounts) and the fact that dominated plans would generally change
the flow of out-of-pocket costs only for a narrow range of total medical expenses, it is unlikely that
consumer preference for improving the predictability of expenses accounts for a large share of the
observed behavior. Similarly, while sophisticated employees might choose dominated options to avoid
underusing valuable health-care in the face of cost-sharing, as suggested by recent theory (Baicker,
Mullainathan and Schwartsztein 2013), such costly commitments are of limited benefit in a setting like
ours in which such “behavioral moral hazard” could change marginal incentives for only a narrow range
of observed outcomes. 5
Assuming, then, that the observed choices of dominated contracts represent a financial mistake,
we investigate explanations through a series of online experiments.

These experiments involved

thousands of subjects who were asked to make plan choices from stylized menus that were designed to
mimic the firm’s menu in price and structure, but were dramatically simplified. Speaking to the reliability
of the experiments, subjects across a range of conditions produced the same double-peaked pattern in
deductible choice, with peaks in demand for the $500 and $1,000 deductibles, as that exhibited by the
firm employees. We initially test whether employee choice was due to the search complexity associated with
5 The marginal incentives for using health care differ across plans primarily for the small range of outcomes where the total yearly medical
bills fall between two deductibles (e.g., between $500 and $1,000).

the large number of available plan options and the particular design of the enrollment interface faced by
employees. 6 Our experimental test of search complexity, in which we varied the number of plans and
plan attributes available, the ease with which subjects could compare plans, and the consistency with
which plan premiums and deductibles were presented, suggests that reducing such complexity improves
choice, but only modestly. A majority of subjects failed to detect dominated plans even when presented
with an extremely simple menu featuring four plans differing only on deductible and price.
Given the modest role of search complexity in explaining choice quality, and in light of prior
research on the pervasiveness of health illiteracy, in a second online experiment we explored the
possibility that poor choice was a consequence of either a deficit in search motivation or low levels of health
insurance literacy. While we found that a majority of subjects do not anticipate that plan menus might
include plans of low financial value, our attempts to inform people of the financial implications of choice
led to very little choice improvement. Consistent with this latter result, most subjects lacked definitional
and conceptual understanding of insurance concepts such as a deductible and copayment, and these
deficits in insurance literacy predicted poor plan choices. Further implicating the importance of literacy
in explaining poor choice, the introduction of real-time decision-aids designed to educate subjects led to
significant improvements in choice quality.
While the choice inefficiency exhibited by employees and experimental subjects appears largely
attributable to consumer illiteracy with respect to the basic structure of insurance, the deductible choices
we observe are far from random. In particular, we document evidence for adverse selection in that older
and sicker employees are more likely to select into plans with more insurance coverage. In a final
experiment, we explore how beliefs about health risk predict demand for coverage. We again present
subjects with simple menus and dominated options, but systematically vary the relative cost of plans and
elicit perceptions of risk and health. We find that while consumer choice is modestly sensitive to changes
in the relative cost of price sharing across menus—a demand elasticity which resembles consumers
choosing insurance from non-dominated plans (Einav, Finkelstein and Cullen 2010)—it is strongly
predicted by perceived health status. Less healthy subjects are far more likely to choose additional
coverage even when the cost of that additional coverage is so high as to result in dominated options.
Overall, the choices appear consistent with a heuristic choice strategy in which individuals sort themselves
into plans based on an inference about varying plan generosity and perceptions of their own relative
6 The online interface through which employees enrolled in a plan was designed to emphasize the sense that employees could “build” their
own health plan by sequentially selecting levels within each of four cost-sharing attributes after which plan features and the monthly cost
was displayed. After building a first candidate plan, employees had the option of enrolling in that plan or building subsequent plans which
would be iteratively added to a plan comparison matrix.

healthiness, but without a full financial comparison of plan values (a la Prelec, Wernerfelt & Zettelmeyer
1997, Kamenica, 2008).

The possibility that individuals rely on imperfect heuristics to navigate

consequential decisions is consistent with broader research showing that individuals, faced with complex
choices, make systematic, and costly, mistakes, due to limits to cognition, motivation, and self-control
(see DellaVigna 2009).
The poor health plan choices we document have implications for policy. A first implication is
that the pervasiveness, and persistence, of poor plan choices undermines the stated rationale for choice
expansion. If employees are not able to sensibly compare across plans in a standardized menu in which
all plans have the same insurance provider and vary on only a few features, then it is unlikely that
consumers faced with the far more heterogeneous menus in public exchanges will make much better
choices. Rather than improving plan selection, our findings suggest that the availability of choice may
have led to an increase in spending and loss of consumer welfare that outweighs other consequences of
healthcare reform— e.g., the downward effect on premiums of competition in healthcare exchanges (e.g.,
Burke et al. 2014), or the effect of the mandate on plan prices (e.g., Eibner and Price 2012)—that have
attracted considerable policy attention. Beyond the effects of choice on individual well-being, the inability
of consumers to financially compare plans may cause providers to leverage product complexity to extract
additional economic rents (Sandroni and Squintani 2007; Ho, Hogan, and Morton 2014; Gabaix and
Laibson 2006; DellaVigna and Malmendier 2004; Heidhues and Koszegi 2014).
The widespread lack of health plan literacy also speaks to the potential benefits of facilitating
consumer decisions with simplification and appropriately tailored decision-aids. Among both employees
and our experimental subjects, those with low literacy or low self-reported income made inferior plan
choices. In the experiments, simplification and, to a far greater extent, education, improved choice
quality, especially among employees with lower incomes. Yet, the persistence of a non-trivial share of
poor choice across our studies— even with aggressive treatments, nearly 30% of subjects continued to
select dominated options—implies a ceiling in the efficacy of even the most benevolent of choice
environments. These results lend support to recent arguments that policies requiring providers to restrict
choice sets to plans that are suitable for a particular consumer, or to simplify and standardize the structure
of insurance products may be more effective at improving consumer welfare and ensuring competitive
prices than policies aimed at simplifying choice environments. (Loewenstein and Volpp 2011; Bhargava
and Loewenstein 2015).
Finally, the results of this study have broader implications for evaluating risk and welfare from
consumer choices in insurance markets (see Einav, Finkelstein and Levin, 2010 for a review). The
5

approach in this literature builds on the canonical model of insurance choice (Rothschild and Stiglitz,
1976), in which the demand for insurance comes from the value of reducing variance in spending for
risk-averse consumers with private information about their health risk. However, as Handel and Kolstad
(forthcoming) discuss, if consumer demand for insurance reflects informational frictions or decisionmaking bias, inferences regarding risk attitudes and welfare dynamics made from such choices may be
misleading. 7 Our results, in which a majority of employees and online subjects select dominated
contracts, complement this work by documenting clear violations of the standard model of insurance
choice. Since our setting involves poor choices across options that vary only on price and cost-sharing
dimensions, our findings motivate the need for new approaches for describing insurance demand which
reflect an even more fundamental departure in how people evaluate health plans than those adopted by
prior work.
While individuals may not commonly face dominated health plan options of the sort examined
here, the economics and welfare implications underlying the behavior we observe may be far more
widespread. We illustrate the broader applicability of our findings using the framework developed by
Einav, Finkelstein and Cullen (2010). First, we show how, in the face of substantial adverse selection,
high prices for modest reductions in cost sharing for health plans (including dominated pricing) can
emerge. 8 In such situations, high-risk individuals who lack insurance sophistication may select into high
coverage plans that reveal one’s risk type while offering only benefits through additional insurance (Baker
2011). Next, we highlight simple indicators in this framework that help identify when choices deviate
meaningfully from the standard model even in situations without strictly dominated contracts. The
health-plan choices by employees in the Einav, Finkelstein and Cullen (2010) study, for example, exhibit
these indicators of non-standard preferences even though that setting does not involve dominated
options. Finally, through a simulation of plan choices, we show that failing to account for a heuristic
choice process, consistent with the behavior we document, can lead to a substantial mis-estimation of
the welfare loss associated with adverse selection.
Our work builds on several interconnected literatures. Our primary analysis of plan choice and
inertia follows up on studies documenting sub-optimal health plan decisions and inertia among seniors.
Unlike the complex environment of Medicare Part D, which features a wide variation in plan price,
coverage, and design, and requires consumers to make complicated multi-attribute comparisons, we

See also Anatasov and Baker (2014) who provide some similar evidence about biased beliefs about health plans.
This happens if plan prices are based on the total average cost differences between groups selecting different plans rather than on the average
cost of the additional coverage provided to those opting for lower cost sharing plans.

investigate choice in highly standardized setting. The experiments we use to explore decision-making
mechanisms, and to identify possible strategies to improve choice, parallel other studies in which subjects
are asked to make choices from hypothetical plan menus (Johnson et al. 2013; Schram and Sonnemans,
2011; Bhargava, Loewenstein and Benartzi 2015). In documenting the pervasiveness and consequences
of low health plan literacy, we contribute to a growing literature which points to the likelihood that
individuals misconstrue important health incentives (e.g., Loewenstein et al. 2013; Winter et al., 2006;
Handel and Kolstad 2013). Our findings regarding the large, and potentially regressive, costs of
complexity are in line with other demonstrations of how complexity adversely affects behavior across a
range of economically important settings. 9 Finally, our work contributes to the rapidly emerging literature
on behavioral considerations in insurance markets, and highlights the importance of continued research
on the role of cognitive limitations and search frictions (Fang, Keane and Silverman, 2008; Handel and
Kolstad, forthcoming; Spinnewijn, 2014, Schmitz and Ziebarth, 2015), non-standard risk preferences
(Koszegi and Rabin, 2007; Sydnor, 2010; Bordalo et al., 2012; Barseghyan et al., 2013, 2014) and decision
heuristics (Ericson and Starc, 2012).

SECTION 2. DATA AND INSTITUTIONAL BACKGROUND
In our main analysis, we draw on administrative data on medical claims and plan choice for 2010
and 2011 from a Fortune 100 firm whose identity we suppress for confidentiality. This section
summarizes relevant institutional detail, the data, and descriptive statistics. We separately describe the
data and subject characteristics for the mechanism experiments in Section 4.
2.1. Background and Institutional Detail
Structure of Health Plan Menu. In 2010 the firm replaced its existing menu of three plans and a
highly varied bundle of plan attributes (Basic, Plus, Premium), with a “Build Your Own” regime in which
employees were offered a choice from a standardized menu of 48 plans. For employees choosing single
coverage, the focus of our analysis, these plans represented the full conjoint of available options across 4
annual deductibles ($1000; $750; $500; $350), 3 levels of maximum-out-of-pocket spending above the
deductible ($3000; $2500; $1500; MOOP), 2 coinsurance rates on coverage above the deductible and
before the out-of-pocket max is hit (80%; 90%), and 2 office copayments ($15 for Primary Care Visits /

programs (Bhargava and Manoli 2014).

$40 for Specialist Visits; $25 for Primary Care Visits / $35 for Specialists). Out-of-network, all plans
featured a $3,500 deductible a $7500 out-of-pocket maximum and either a 50% or 60% coinsurance rate
depending on the choice of in-network coinsurance. Beyond the described variation in cost-sharing, plans
were otherwise identical. In the following year, the set of available plans did not change with respect to
their cost-sharing features. Table 1 reports details for the plan menu. 10
Plan Pricing and Dominated Choices. Our ability to characterize choice quality rests on the price
domination reflected in plan menus and a high degree of plan standardization which facilitates easy
comparisons across plans. For example, Plan 13 is identical to Plan 37, except in the deductible level
which varies by $500. Plan 13 (with the $500 deductible) costs $638 more in annual premium than Plan
37 (the $1,000 deductible). Because the difference in plan premiums exceeds the difference in deductibles,
Plan 13 is financially dominated by the otherwise equivalent plan with the $1,000 deductible. Of the 36
low-deductible plans, 35 are financially dominated as indicated by the highlighted sections of Table 1,
with the premium of Plan 24 falling $20 short of a fully dominated plan menu by deductible.
Figure 1 presents an alternative way of visualizing the dominance of plan menus. This figure
shows the schedule of medical spending (i.e., employee premium plus out-of-pocket costs) an employee
would be responsible for as a function of total medical expenses/bills for plans with a maximum out of
pocket of $2,500, 80% coinsurance and the $25/$35 copay level. Of employees choosing single coverage,
15.5 percent chose a plan from this set which contains the second most popular plan option overall (i.e.,
the $500 deductible). The figure depicts schedules for the four different deductible levels available and
normalizes the premium of the $1,000-deductible plan at $0. One plan is dominated by another if that
plan’s cost schedule is above the other for the entire range of medical spending. Among plans in this
representative set, each plan with a lower deductible is dominated by the plan with the $1,000 deductible
while the $350 deductible plan is dominated by all of the other deductible levels.
Given that health-insurance premiums are generally tax deductible, while out-of-pocket expenses
are not, plans that appear to be dominated on a nominal basis may not be strictly dominated after
adjusting for an employee’s marginal tax rate. Table 1, which also depicts plan dominance using the
average marginal federal income tax rate (implied by salary bands available in the data) across employees
of 19% to adjust for premium deductibility, shows little erosion in the share of dominated plans due to

10 Plan prices feature small differences across geographic area and business units. Prices are averaged across geographies and business
units (but not coverage tier) for our analysis. According to the Firm, such price differences are modest, and do not meaningfully affect
price differences across plans for a given geography area x business unit.

tax adjustments in that 30 plans remain dominated. When feasible, we report our analysis of plan choice
after adjusting for taxes using estimates of employee-specific marginal federal income tax rates.
Our analysis includes a description of plan switching by employees in 2011. While the plan menu
faced by employees in 2011 was identical with respect to the structure of plans, plan prices grew by an
average of 31% across plans and this increase was fairly consistent across plans by level of cost-sharing.
The consistency in this price increase actually led to an increased degree of price domination in 2011 such
that, without tax adjustment, all 36 low deductible plans were financially dominated.
Plan Enrollment. During the open enrollment period in May 2010, eligible employees, excluding
new hires, were asked to enroll in a medical plan for “Plan Year” 2010 extending from June 1st, 2010
through May 31st, 2011. 11 For simplicity, we refer below to plan years by the year in which the selection
was made (e.g., 2010 refers to PY 2010). Eligible new hires were permitted to choose a plan outside the
enrollment period, after a three month waiting period, unless the hiring date was proximal to the
enrollment period. Given that plan options changed in 2010, employees were encouraged to make an
active choice into a new health plan. If an employee with existing coverage did not actively elect a new
plan, he or she was defaulted into Plan 48, which had minimum premium and the maximum possible
cost-sharing on each dimension and, importantly, was not dominated.

Default effects, therefore,

weighed against choice of a dominated plan. While we cannot distinguish enrollment into Plan 48 due to
default from an active election, given intensive marketing effort prior to open enrollment, the firm
reported that active choice of plans was high. Our estimate, based on the plan choice of new hires not
subject to a default, and existing employees who were, is that the presence of a default led to an additional
enrollment of 2 percent in the plan designated as the default. Stated differently, active choice was 98%. 12
While there was a default option available for existing employees who did not visit the enrollment
interface, the interface itself did not feature a default.
The online interface through which employees enrolled in a plan was designed to emphasize the
sense that employees could “build” their own health plan feature by feature. Employees were asked to
build candidate plans by sequentially selecting levels within each of four cost-sharing attributes, (e.g.,
“Which annual deductible meets your needs?”), after which plan features and the monthly cost was
displayed. Employees were urged to consider the tradeoffs between price and coverage (e.g., “Remember,

11 Employees could change plan elections outside of open enrollment only in the event of a change in “qualified status” (e.g., birth of a
child, or change in marital status).
12 If we estimate the probability of choosing the default plan (Plan 48) controlling for age and chronic conditions and an indicator for
existing coverage, we find that those with existing coverage were 2 percentage points more likely to choose Plan 48 than similar new
employees who did not have the default option.

a lower deductible means higher annual paycheck costs”). After building a first candidate plan, employees
had the option of enrolling in that plan or building subsequent plans which were then iteratively added
to a plan comparison matrix. As such, the interface encouraged side-by-side comparisons of plans, but
did not facilitate comparisons of marginal differences across plan attributes. The interface offered
employees the option of viewing the entire plan menu in a link but it was not prominently displayed.
2.2. Data on Plan Choice, Health Spending, and Employee Characteristics
Overview of Data. For each benefit-eligible employee in 2010, the data include plan choice, medical
utilization, and spending (subject to restrictions enumerated below), while for 2011, the data include only
plan choice. Utilization data summarizes employee visits to a primary care physician, specialist, and ER
and for preventative care. Medical-spend data reflects total medical expenses for each employee as well
as the decomposition of spending into the share of employee’s out-of-pocket expenses and the residual
expenses covered by the firm. Importantly, the firm additionally estimated counterfactual medical spend,
for both the member and firm, associated with each of the 47 plans not chosen by the employee
(assuming fixed employee utilization). These estimates assume prices that are averaged across different
locations and, as such, obscure any geographic price variation in prices. We obtained additional employeelevel demographic and health characteristics including age range, gender, salary band, location (3 digit zip
code), start year of employment, position at the firm, length of firm tenure, and the presence of preexisting chronic medical conditions.
Sample Restrictions. Starting with the original set of benefit eligible employees, the firm generated
a restricted sample for analysis using three screening criteria. First, in order to simplify the calculation of
medical spending, the sample was restricted to employees continuously enrolled for the entirety of the
plan year (June 2010 through end of May 2011). Second, for data integrity, employees who changed plans
outside of open enrollment due to a life changing event were excluded. Finally, a small number of
employees were excluded due to incomplete basic demographic information. The analysis presented in
this paper is restricted to employees choosing single-coverage plans. A more extensive analysis, not
reported here, suggests that employees choosing plans with expanded coverage behaved similarly to those
described in the present analysis.
2.3. Summary Statistics
After imposing the sample restrictions, the resulting data describe plan choice, utilization, and
medical care spending in PY 2010 for 51,192 employees, of whom 23,894 are employees with single-only
10

coverage.

Table 2 reports summary statistics for this latter sample.

Overall, the sample is

disproportionately female (71%), and only 7% of employees were newly hired in 2010. The average
premium for employees, $1,205, is in line with the $999 national estimate for the average single-coverage
employee premium in 2012, while the plans offered by the firm have lower deductibles than a typical firm
of its size. 13 The firm covers approximately 45% of total employee medical spending, and the average
per capita employee spending of $3,567 is slightly lower than the $4,547 national per capita average for
enrollees of employee sponsored plans. 14
SECTION 3. ANALYSIS OF PLAN CHOICE AND SWITCHING
In the previous section we introduced the plan menu offered by the firm and described how the
majority of plan options with lower deductibles were financially dominated. In this section we document
employee choices and the financial consequences of those choices.
3.1 Plan Choice Patterns
Figure 2 presents histograms of plan choice by employees electing single coverage for 2010.
Despite the financial domination of nearly all plans with deductibles less than $1,000 prior to tax
adjustment, 63% of employees selected a low deductible (Panel A). After tax-adjustment using the
inferred marginal tax rate for each employee based on their reported salary range, 55% of employees
selected a plan that was financially dominated by another available plan option, and 27% of employees
chose $350 or $750 deductible plans that were typically dominated by a large extent. The focus on
deductibles alone, however, obscures meaningful patterns in plan choices. Panel B of the figure depicts
the distribution of choice across all 48 plan combinations ordered by the degree of plan cost-sharing (by
deductible, out-of-pocket maximum, coinsurance, and then copayment). The wide variety of chosen
plans—every one of the 48 plans has a non-trivial share of enrollees—is evidence that the online
enrollment process did not privilege the choice of any particular plan or plan attribute and further
suggests that employees exhibited a range of plan preferences and/or search strategies. The single most
popular plan was Plan 48, which was the least expensive, featured the highest degree of cost-sharing on
all dimensions and was the default plan for those with existing coverage who did not choose a plan in the

new interface. As noted above, though we cannot unambiguously distinguish between those actively
choosing Plan 48 from those defaulting into the plan, comparisons to new hires suggest that the vast
majority of choices were actively made.
The choice patterns of Figure 2 reveal what appears to be a number of distinct strategies which
govern the selection of plan attribute combinations. Among employees opting for the expensive $350
deductibles, most appeared to minimize cost-sharing across all dimensions, and the most conservative,
lower MOOP, lower copay and higher coinsurance option was the modal choice. Employees who chose
the $500 and $750 deductible levels, in contrast, chose plans consistent with the desire to balance across
cost-sharing dimensions. The modal plan for employees selecting both the $500 and $750 deductibles,
for example, included the mid-level MOOP ($2,500). Ignoring the default option, such balancing is also
evidenced among employees choosing the $1,000 deductible where a significant share of employees chose
the high-cost sharing MOOP ($1,500). This coherence in attribute patterns suggests that employees may
have had some understanding of the tradeoffs between the level of coverage associated with plan
attributes and plan premiums, a possibility which we explore in greater detail later in the paper.
3.2 Savings from Counterfactual Plan Choice
While characterizing the degree of dominated plan choice does not require knowledge of an
employee’s health spending, such spending is useful in assessing the financial consequences of these
choices. For example, consider that for an employee paying an additional $501 in premiums to lower the
deductible from $1,000 to $500, the magnitude of ex-post excess spending due to plan dominance could
be as high as $501 or as low as $1 depending on the employee’s use of medical care for the year while exante excess spending would be somewhere between those values depending on expected medical need.
Figure 3 presents an analysis of the financial consequences of employee plan choices using data
on health spending. Each panel in the figure compares the distribution of actual total employee spending
(premium plus out-of-pocket health-care costs) to estimated spending given a distinct counterfactual plan
choice. Counterfactual spending is calculated at the individual level for each employee on a tax-adjusted
basis and assumes that the utilization of each employee would be unchanged across plans, or equivalently
that employees are not subject to moral hazard in their utilization of care. Although health insurance
plans with lower deductibles likely result in some degree of moral hazard, it is generally difficult to
disentangle moral hazard from adverse selection (Einav and Finkelstein, 2011). If present in this setting,
moral hazard would imply that our analysis would underestimate the financial consequences of plan choice.
Such underestimation would arise since a share of the spending associated with low cost-sharing plans
12

might be deemed unnecessary in the event of the shift to the high-cost sharing plan and could lead to
even greater savings for such individuals.
The first panel of Figure 3 depicts potential cost-savings for each employee currently in a low
deductible plan, relative to a switch to the otherwise equivalent plan with a $1,000 deductible (i.e., same
MOOP, coinsurance, and copayment). We show the empirical cumulative distribution of this ex-post
net savings separately for each of the three low deductibles. The lines associated with the choice of $350
and $750 deductibles both start above $0, indicating that, consistent with the earlier demonstration of
dominance, all employees in such plans would have benefited from the prescribed plan switch. Among
employees who chose plans with $350 deductibles, the average savings amounts to $590 with an interquartile range of $439 to $843. The top 10% (generally those with little to no health expenditures) would
have saved over $1,000. The average potential savings for those selecting plans with the $750 deductible
is $343 (IQ range of $239 to $430), and for those choosing $500 deductibles, the average savings is $159
(IQ range of $102 to $502) inclusive of the 2% of employees with negative potential savings reflecting
the absence of financial domination for all of these plans.
Overall, we find that the individuals who selected plans with deductibles lower than $1,000 could
have saved $353 on average in after-tax dollars had they chosen the $1,000 alternative with virtually no
risk of losing money. 15 Considering that over half of these employees have annual salaries below $30,000,
the $353 in potential after-tax savings is likely of significant economic value. We calculate that the
potential savings for employees selecting dominated plans represents an average of 2% of the employees’
annual salaries and 42% of the annual premiums paid by the typical employee.
In Panel B we present a similar analysis but consider potential savings relative to the “actuarially
best” plan associated with the lowest average spending across all employees (Plan 41 with a $1,000
deductible, $2,500 MOOP, 90% Coinsurance, $25 Copay). 16 This exercise permits us to investigate the
benefits of moving all employees to a single plan. While Plan 41 does not fully dominate the other options,
84% of all employees, and 97% of those with lower deductibles, would have benefited or been left no
worse off, under the contemplated switch. Across employees, average savings would have amounted to
$320 including $448 for those in low deductible plans, and $103 for those with the $1,000 deductible.
The largest loss for any single employee under the projected switch is less than $1,000 and no more than
5% of employees would lose more than $20. These results suggest that, assuming fixed plan prices, an

The welfare value of those potential savings is quite similar even if we allow for substantial levels of risk aversion in a standard expected
utility framework. Those calculations are available from the authors on request.
16 Only 1% of employees actually selected this plan and 26 plans were chosen more frequently.
15

13

informed third-party could have made a simple and generic plan recommendation that would have
benefited the vast majority of employees.
Finally, we replicate the analysis but with Plan 48, the default plan option for employees and the
plan with the highest cost-sharing, as the counterfactual plan. We estimate that such a plan switch would
have benefited, or left unharmed, 85% of employees, and would produce an average savings of $182 for
these employees. As with the other counterfactuals, most of these savings would have accrued to those
presently in low deductible plans, for whom savings would have averaged $283. Relative to the other
counterfactuals, the switch to this highest cost sharing plan would have generated greater risk of excess
spending with a maximum increase in spending of about $1,600 and with 5% of employees spending an
additional $650 or more. Nonetheless, the large share of employees, and particularly those currently with
low deductibles, would have benefitted from simply being placed in the default plan.
3.3 Heterogeneity in Choice and Adverse Selection
The consequences of poor plan choice vary significantly across employees. Figure 4 displays the
share of employees choosing dominated plan options by a primary dimension of interest – employee
salary (Panel A). While a significant share of employees at every salary level chose dominated plans,
employees in the bottom two salary bands (i.e., $0 to $20k, plotted as $10k, and $20 to $30k, plotted as
$25k), representing over half of all employees, were disproportionately likely to have chosen dominated
plans. Using the actuarial best plan (Plan 41) as a counterfactual, the second panel of the figure displays
the average potential plan savings for each employee relative to employee salary (Panel B). For the 19%
of employees in the lowest salary band, the plot implies average savings amounting to over 4% of annual
salary while for the 33% of employees earning from $20 to $30k such savings represents 1.7% of salary.
Table 3 reports the heterogeneity in dominated plan choice across a broader set of employee
characteristics. Each column represents a separate regression in which the dependent variable in the first
column is an indicator for dominated plan choice, and in the final two columns is the magnitude of
potential savings from a switch to a counterfactual plan (with premiums adjusted for tax deductibility in
all cases). These regressions reinforce the pattern evident in Figure 4 in demonstrating a significant
gradient in choice quality by salary— lower-salary employees were 24 to 30 percentage points more likely
to choose a dominated deductible than the highest salary employees. Additionally, female employees
were 6 percentage points more likely to choose dominated plans, and, conditioning on other
characteristics, older, more highly tenured employees, and those with chronic conditions were all more
likely to select dominated plans. Because the dominated plans in this setting are those offering the highest
14

coverage (i.e., low cost-sharing), if people choose naively, the gender and age difference in decision quality
may be consistent with prior work documenting the preference of females and older employees for low
cost-sharing plans.
These results also highlight important patterns related to adverse selection in plan choice. In
particular, the fact that older employees and those with chronic conditions are more likely to select lower
deductibles, is indicative of adverse selection in employee-plan choice. We discuss these patterns of
adverse selection and their importance for understanding the nature of insurance pricing we observe here
in more detail in Section 5.
The second column of the table shows how these characteristics predict the expected
counterfactual savings that employees could have achieved by switching to a $1,000 plan deductible,
holding other plan features constant. For this regression we include all employees and code the potential
savings for those presently with a $1,000 deductible as $0 by construction. These estimates are consistent
with earlier patterns with respect to employee income, age, and tenure, but reveal a different pattern for
women and those with chronic conditions. Although these groups were more likely to choose plans that
were financially dominated, they could expect to save less by switching to a high deductible plan given
their higher relative levels of health spending. The final column considers the expected savings from a
switch to Plan 41 and yields similar patterns to the choice estimates, and with generally larger marginal
effects, which suggests that the same characteristics that predict the choice of a dominated deductible
also tend to predict the choice of plans with lower average value on other dimensions as well.
3.4 Employee Plan Switching
Do employees improve plan choice over time? The stability of the plan menu permits us to
examine whether employees improved plan choices the year following their original plan choices. In the
second year of the build-your-own plan regime, the firm offered an identical set of plans to employees
but with plan prices which increased by an average of 31%. The change in plan prices led to a slight
increase in plan dominance such that all 36 plans were financially dominated (on a tax-unadjusted basis).
Employees, who were insured in 2010, but did not actively choose a plan in 2011 were defaulted into
their existing plan.
Figure 5 summarizes switching behavior for employees by deductible choice. Overall, 77% of
employees kept their existing plan, consistent with numerous studies documenting consumer inertia in
insurance choices (e.g., Strombom et al. 2002; Frank and Lamiraud, 2009; Sydnor, 2010; Handel, 2013;
Ericson, forthcoming). Those with low deductible plans were more likely to switch plans relative to those
15

with the $1,000 deductible. However, switching rates for employees in $350 and $750 deductible plans,
for whom the benefits of switching was the highest, were lower than those in $500 deductible plans.
Switching generally resulted in higher deductibles, but not always to the optimal $1,000 deductible. On
average, however, the moderate degree of plan switching we observed was beneficial with respect to plan
dominance.
Finally, in light of the significant heterogeneity in choice quality by employee income, it is natural
to ask whether lower or higher income employees are more likely to switch into efficient plans in the
following year. We find that employees in the lowest two salary bands are actually significantly less likely
to switch plans, with a switching rate of 18%, relative to higher income employees who switch at a rate
of 28% (p < .01). Among those who do switch, low income employees are also significantly less likely
to switch into the $1,000 deductible. Indeed, the considerable plan inertia in this setting, if anything,
serves to exacerbate the already substantial differences in choice quality across income groups.
SECTION 4. MECHANISMS UNDERLYING POOR CHOICE
Why would individuals choose financially dominated health plans? In this section we test
candidate mechanisms for the observed behavior through a set of experiments in which we ask online
subjects to make hypothetical health plan choices from stylized plan menus meant to reflect the choices
made by employees.
4.1 Candidate Explanations for Poor Plan Choice
A first explanation we consider, in the first study, is whether search frictions generated by the
complexity of the plan menu and the enrollment interface contributed to poor decisions. We broadly
interpret such search complexity to encompass the large size of the plan menu (see Botti and Iyengar 2006
for a review of the “choice overload” literature), the number of attributes characterizing each plan, and
the ease with which employees could compare plans. Search frictions may be particularly relevant in the
setting we examine, given that the enrollment interface faced by employees may have discouraged
appropriate plan comparisons.
We test two additional mechanisms through our second experiment. First, we consider whether
poor plan choice is the result of deficits in health insurance literacy (e.g., Loewenstein et al. 2013; Handel
2013). We interpret literacy to include definitional knowledge of cost-sharing features (e.g., the ability to
define and identify a plan’s deductible and coinsurance rate), the conceptual ability to apply definitional
16

knowledge to evaluate and compare the financial value of plans (e.g., given a set of plans for which other
cost-sharing parameters are fixed, plan values can be compared by simply comparing the plan deductibles
and premiums), and the computational ability to carry out required calculations. Second, we examine the
possibility that poor choice may result from insufficient motivation on the part of employees to search
and compare plans. Such a deficit might result from a false belief that the employer would not offer plan
options of transparently lower economic value.
In a final experiment we explore the sensitivity of plan choices, in the presence of a largely
dominated plan menu, to perceived health status and changes in plan prices. This experiment permits us
to consider the degree to which individuals rely on the inputs—plan prices and health risk—typically
expected to be relevant for plan choices. To the extent that individuals respond to trade-offs between
dominated plan options as they would in the face of fairly priced menus suggests that plan selections may
be the result of heuristic choice strategies.
Beyond the mechanisms which we test experimentally, the possibility exists that the observed
behavior may, at least partially, reflect a sophisticated preference for financing health spending through
payroll deductions rather than, more predictable, out-of-pocket expenses. This preference could result
from the high costs of budgeting or liquidity constraints that make unexpected expenses difficult to
manage. Models of non-standard risk preferences also predict demand for low-deductibles. For instance,
individuals might rely on a separate “mental account” for expected monthly payroll contributions as
compared to unexpected, and more hedonically painful, out-of-pocket expenses, (e.g., Prelec and
Loewenstein 1998), may be subject to reference dependent preferences such that unexpected expenses
are subject to loss aversion (e.g., Koszegi and Rabin 2007), or may be eager to avoid cost-sharing if they
anticipate that such cost-sharing would lead them to underutilize valuable healthcare (Baiker,
Mullainathan and Schwartzstein, 2013).

Given that the typical employee who chose a dominated

plan paid $631 more relative to the high deductible option, and benefited by an average of $259 in reduced
out-of-pocket spending, for differential preferences across payroll and out-of-pocket dollars to rationalize
the observed choices, employees must value an expected out-of-pocket dollar 2.4 times more than a dollar
deducted from payroll. Moreover, the relief from unexpected expenses involves the marginal reduction
of expenses over a very narrow range of out-of-pocket spending. For example, an employee choosing
the $500 deductible over the $1,000 option only sees a reduction in out-of-pocket costs if total health
spending is between $500 and $1,000. While we cannot definitely rule out this explanation, given the
availability of alternative sources of financing almost certainly available to most employees, the narrow
range of expenses over which the choice of a dominated plan might reduce out-of-pocket spending, and
17

the high degree of literacy required to appropriately act on these preferences, we do not believe that a
preference-based explanation is likely to account for a large share of the observed inefficiencies in choice.
4.2 Experiment 1 - Search Complexity
In our first study, conducted in June 2014, subjects were paid to take an approximately 10 minute
survey in which they were asked to select an insurance plan from a hypothetical plan menu. The stylized
menu featured fewer plans than the actual firm’s menu but reflected the same degree of price domination.
While our study was not incentive compatible, in similar studies other researchers have detected no
differences in choice quality as a function of incentive compatibility (Johnson et al. 2013). The size and
structure of the plan menu, as well the effort required to compare plans, was randomized between
subjects in order to test how transitioning from a fairly complex interface, roughly approximating the
firm environment, to a highly simple interface, influenced the quality of decisions. Appendix A overviews
details of each experiment.
Subjects. The first study involved N = 2,379 U.S. subjects drawn from the Qualtrics Online
Sample. Of 3,895 subjects who began the survey, 1,516 subjects failed an early attention screen and were
not invited to complete the instrument. 17 The final sample, while not strictly representative of the US
population, was diverse across gender (57% female; 43% male), age (M=46.5, s.d. = 11.1), education
(48% college graduate; 33% some college; 18% high school or equivalent), race (84% white; 9% black;
other 8%), and inferred income (M = $67,700; s.d. = 26,900). Much like the employee sample in the
main analysis, subjects were predominately full-time employees (91% full-time; 3% part-time; 6%
unemployed or student) who had employer-provided insurance (86% employer insurance; 9% insured
but not through employer; 5% uninsured). Overall, the experimental sample was older and wealthier
than the employees in the main analysis.
Research Design. The study, hosted on the Qualtrics platform, required subjects to provide
background information on their demographics and health, after which they were asked to imagine that
they needed to select a (single coverage) health plan from a plan menu presented to them by their
employer. The menu featured plans resembling those of the firm in price and in cost-sharing features,
but featured fewer plans and were characterized by a smaller number of attributes. Mimicking the actual
firm interface, subjects were presented with a table that defined each attribute and were instructed to
17 The screen involved a question with introductory text and 4 response options. The last line of the text asked subjects to not click on
any response but instead, to simply click on next (unlike other forced-response questions, in this question, subjects were permitted to click
“next” without indicating a response option). We pre-committed ourselves to not collecting any data from anyone who failed the attention
screen.

18

consider their expected health usage when choosing a plan. 18 To test the link between choice quality and
complexity, we randomized, in a conjoint design, the choice interface across three dimensions. The first
was whether plan premiums were expressed annually or monthly. In the actual choice interface
confronted by employees at the firm, premiums were presented on a monthly basis, whereas deductibles
were for the year; we conjectured that this incompatibility may have made it more difficult for employees
to evaluate the tradeoff between the two. Second, to test whether the inherent complexity of the
insurance products may have played a role, we varied whether menus featured plans differing across two
attributes (i.e., four deductibles and three MOOPs resulting in twelve options), or a single attribute (i.e.,
four deductibles resulting in four options). If complexity contributed to poor choice, then we should
expect to observe lower quality choices with two attributes than with one. Third, in a condition designed
to examine the impact of the company-provided web decision aid, we manipulated whether options were
displayed simultaneously on a single table, permitting easy comparisons, or (as was the case in the Firm)
displayed sequentially by attribute. 19 In the latter condition, subjects were asked to make each attribute
choice separately, after which the resulting plan price was displayed. Subjects could then finalize a choice
or continue “building” another plan through the same sequential process, similar to what employees at
the firm who used the company-provided decision aid experienced. 20

Examples of interventions are

displayed in the Appendix.
Results. An initial outcome of the study, which speaks to the ecological validity of the online
study, is that the overall distribution of subject deductible choice resembled that of employees in the main
analysis (Figure 6, Panel A). The second panel of the figure reports decision quality, reflected by the
share of $1k deductible choice, across experimental interfaces varying from the complex analogue faced
by firm employees (2 attributes, sequential choice, monthly premiums) to a highly simplified menu
featuring four plans characterized by a single attribute and annual premiums. The share of nondominated plan selection across this gradation of complexity suggests significant gains from simplifying
plan comparisons through the simultaneous display of plans (p = 0.01). Further simplification through
the display of annualized premiums, or the movement from 2 attribute choices (and 12 plans) to a single
attribute (4 plans) did not improve choice quality. Although some of the experimental treatments had an
effect, even in the condition that should have made it easiest for subjects to choose wisely— the one with
Subjects were told that plans were equivalent apart from the attribute variation displayed in the menu, and that each plan included a
“modest copay” for doctor visits.
19 In the menu featuring plans varying across only deductible, subjects were told to assume a $1,500 out-of-pocket maximum.
20 We note, however, that while this condition was designed to most clearly mimic the setting at the firm we study, we suspect that
introducing sequential choices is especially likely to cause low effort in a hypothetical setting, as there is no compelling reason for a subject
to go back and “build another” plan.
18

19

the simplest menu featuring 4 simultaneously displayed plans varying by deductible and annualized
premiums— 66% chose a financially dominated plan option; almost the same as the fraction of
employees who chose dominated options.
Much like the employee setting, we observe considerable heterogeneity in the quality of choices
by subject income. In a linear model of overall response across conditions, controlling for other
observable demographics, we estimate that those reporting annual earnings of less than $50k make
inferior choices to those earning greater than $80k (p < 0.05). 21 Simplification also appeared to
disproportionately aid subjects of low income (Panel C).
4.3 Experiment 2 - Insurance Literacy and Search Motivation
While the first study offers modest evidence of the role of menu and interface complexity on
choice quality, our second experiment presented subjects with relatively simple plan menus, to investigate
whether literacy of health insurance concepts and economic motivation to scrutinize plans affects
decision quality. The study, therefore, scrutinizes the possibility that it may not be the complexity of plan
search, but the more fundamental complexity of the structure of insurance that leads to inefficient choice.
Subjects. The second experiment, conducted in July 2014, involved N = 624 U.S. subjects
recruited from the same panel as the first study and subject to the same attention screen. The final sample
again reflects a diversity of gender (56% female), age (M=49.8, s.d. = 12.3), education (39% college
graduate; 38% some college; 21% high school or equivalent), race (86% white; 7% black; other 7%), and
inferred income (M = $50,600; s.d. = 30,700). Subjects in the second study were more diverse in
employment (43% full-time; 13% part-time; 43% unemployed) and insurance status (37% employer
insurance; 52% insured not through employer; 12% uninsured) than either the original study or the
empirical sample.
Research Design and Protocol. The second experiment featured a similar structure and design
as the first study but included assessments of literacy and beliefs. The former was implemented by
presenting subjects with a short narrative scenario of a recent health insurance enrollee in which they
were asked to identify various health insurance concepts (i.e., deductible, out-of-pocket maximum,
coinsurance and copayment). We assessed subject beliefs regarding the likelihood that they would be
offered plan options of low financially value by asking: “When enrolling in health insurance, typically
you would be asked to choose from a set of health plans with very different prices (premium). What
21 We elicited income in five ranges, but we consolidate the highest two income categories ( income greater than $120k, and income
between $80k to $120k) for increased power and analytic tractability.

20

would you expect to be true about these plan options?” Subjects could indicate that the price differences
usually reflect differences in quality or coverage (“you get what you pay for”), do not reflect such
differences (“many plans are simply a bad deal”), or uncertainty about what to expect.
To experimentally test whether improving health literacy and search motivation might affect
choice quality, subjects were randomized into one of three conditions in which they were asked to make
a choice first from a menu with 4 plan options (varying by deductible) and then from a menu with 12
plan options (varying by deductible and MOOP). All menus featured low deductible options which were
dominated by the highest deductible plan. Prices were approximated from the firm menu, but differed
nominally across the two menus to avoid presenting subjects with identical plans. In the control
condition, subjects were simply asked to make the two plan choices. In a second condition, we attempted
to manipulate search motivation by displaying a screen prior to the choice screen which informed subjects
that the options were not designed to be appropriate for everyone and that poor plan choice could lead
to additional spending of nearly $500 annually. In a final condition, subjects were guided, prior to the
choice, through a scenario-based tutorial offering instruction as to how to compare the financial value of
plans, including a quiz, and a “rule-of-thumb” to help subjects avoid financially dominated plans. 22
Results. A majority of the study subjects did not report suspicions that plan menus contain
options of low economic value. 23 As evident in Figure 7 Panel A, subjects who believed that offered
options might differ in their price-quality tradeoff (i.e., subjects included in the bars marked “Suspicious”)
were only marginally more likely to choose non-dominated options than “Trusting” subjects (in the single
attribute choice, pair-wise comparison not significant; in the two attribute choice, pair-wise comparison,
p < 0.10). Finally, as can be seen in Panel B of the same figure, cautioning individuals that the choice
they face may be consequential (bars labeled “motivate”) did not improve choice relative to subjects in
the control group. In sum, while we document widespread ignorance of the possibility of dominated plan
options, we find only weak support for the possibility that such ignorance is alone mediating poor plan
choice.
Turning to the impact of literacy, consistent with earlier studies, we find that 71% of subjects
were not able to identify the basic cost-sharing features from a simple health scenario. 24 Moreover,
literacy, was highly predictive of subject ability to detect dominated plan options (both pairwise
22 Subjects were informed that if other plan features were identical, a dominated plan can be detected by comparing the difference
between plan deductibles and plan premiums.
23 28% expected plans to typically feature such options, 54% believed that price differences typically reflect quality differences, and 18%
were unsure.
24 We counted inverted responses for the coinsurance question as correct, otherwise 82% of participants failed to identify the four costsharing principles correctly.

21

comparisons, p < 0.01), as can be seen in the right hand graph of Panel A. Providing further support for
the importance of literacy, the information intervention aimed at improving literacy (see Appendix for
details of the intervention) significantly improved choice quality relative to the control (both questions,
p < 0.01). Moreover, as revealed in Panel C, the education intervention led to larger relative increases in
response quality for those of low, as compared to high, baseline literacy. As in the first study, we observe
a ceiling in choice quality in that thirty to forty percent of subjects persist in poor choices even with a
fairly aggressive intervention designed to improve choice.
4.4 Experiment 3 – Responsiveness of Choices to Plan Price and Perceived Health Status
The first two experiments found that a majority of subjects chose dominated options even when
faced with extremely simple menus. While most subjects suffer from low plan literacy, our empirical
analysis of the employee data shows correlations between choices and health status that suggest those
choosing dominated options are not just choosing randomly. In our third study we more directly explore
the considerations that shape insurance demand by examining the sensitivity of choice the perceived
health risk of subjects and to price differences between plans, across menus with many dominated
options.
Subjects. The third experiment, a 15 minute online instrument, was completed by a sample of N
= 734 subjects recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk in December 2014. The sample was again
diverse across demographic characteristics such as gender (49% female; 51% male), education (49%
college graduate; 40% some college; 10% high school), and race (76% white; 7% black; 17% other) but
is somewhat younger (M=36.5, s.d. = 12.0), and of lower inferred income ($40,940, s.d. = 19,117). 80%
of subjects had health insurance, and 59% were employed full time.
Research Design and Protocol. The study was similar in structure to earlier experiments in
capturing a range of demographic characteristics, but included a number of additional questions designed
to assess perceptions of subject healthiness relative to peers (“Extremely Healthy”, “Fairly Healthy”,
“Somewhat Healthy”, “Unhealthy”), financial literacy, using two commonly used elicitations as discussed
by Lusardi (2008), as well as a series of other questions constructed for a separate research study on risktaking. 25 The survey’s main outcome of interest was plan choice from a simple menu featuring four plans
characterized by a deductible and an annual premium (and otherwise identical). As can be seen in Table

The study was a part of a larger survey originally administered for separate on-going research examining risk preferences and driving
behavior conducted by Bhargava and other coauthors. Subjects in this survey were screened on ownership of a vehicle and were
restricted to those 21 years and older.

25

22

4, in a first condition, we presented a menu featuring four popular plans from the firm’s menu (Plans 46,
34, 22, and 10) which spanned the range of available deductibles ($350, $500, $750, $1,000) and shared
other cost-sharing features. In the second condition (“More expensive”), we fixed the annual price of the
$1,000 deductible ($817) but increased the costliness of reduced cost-sharing by pricing the low
deductible plans so that the marginal cost of each dollar of reduced deductible, relative to the highdeductible option, was 125% of the original marginal cost. That is, while the original $750 plan cost
$1321, or $504 more than the $1,000 plan, in the expensive condition, this plan was priced at $1447 which
reflects a $630 differential. In a third condition (“Less expensive”) we adjusted prices so that the marginal
cost of a reduced dollar in deductible was only 75% as costly as the original marginal cost. Across these
conditions, low-deductible plans in the baseline and expensive conditions were financially dominated by
the $1,000 plan, while in the cheap condition the $500 deductible plan fell $49 short of being dominated
(price difference of $451).
Results. Figure 8 summarizes the result of the third experiment. Panel A shows that subjects
were moderately responsive to the price differentials across the different treatments despite nearly all of
the lower deductible options being dominated across all treatments. The fraction of subjects choosing
the $1,000 deductible is around 11 percentage points higher in the “More expensive” treatment than the
“Less expensive treatment” (p < 0.03). Importantly, this price elasticity is similar to that observed by
Einav, Finkelstein and Cullen (2010) for employees choosing from menus that do not include dominated
options. Einav, Finkelstein and Cullen (2010) estimate that every dollar of additional premium reduces
the share of individuals willing to pay to eliminate an in-network deductible by $500 by 0.0007. If we
consider the differential demand for the $500 and $1,000 deductibles (a difference in $500 in cost-sharing)
among subjects in the experiment, the reduction in the share purchasing the lower deductible yields a
similar 0.0005 per additional dollar in premium. Consistent with the correlation in health status and plan
choice exhibited by employees, Panel B shows that subjects’ perceived health status strongly predicts the
choice of deductible. The 24% of subjects who perceived themselves to be extremely healthy were
significantly more likely to choose the $1,000 deductible option than those with lower perceived health
status (51% vs 33%; p < 0.01). Not depicted in the figure, the 16% of subjects who viewed themselves
as only “Somewhat Healthy” or “Unhealthy” were significantly more likely than their counterparts to opt
into the lowest available deductible (p < 0.05).
The results of this experiment suggest that subjects, when faced with menus involving financially
dominated options, attend to the same key determinants of plan price and health risk in determining their
demand for insurance than they would in menus with plans that are reasonably priced. As with the
23

employees in the main analysis, subjects do not appear to make choices randomly, but instead appear to
recognize the existence of tradeoffs involving plan prices and health risk. Such coherence with respect
to plan tradeoffs may ultimately be naïve, however, given that it is exercised without regard to the
underlying financial value of plans in a particular menu.
4.5 Discussion of Mechanisms
The experiments offer a number of insights into the mechanisms underlying plan choice. First,
while there are modest benefits to simplifying search by facilitating plan comparisons (Experiment 1),
even with highly simplified menus featuring a small number of plans and plan attributes, a majority of
subjects fail to detect dominated plans. Moreover, the widespread lack of health insurance and financial
literacy, and low awareness that menus might feature dominated plans, support the likelihood that most
employees were unable, or perhaps unmotivated, to rigorously compare the financial value of plans
(Experiment 2). Despite their economic inefficiency, however, the choices of study subjects display the
same non-random character of those made by employees, including peaks in demand for $500 and $1,000
deductibles and correlations with health risk.
Overall, these experiments suggest that the costly choice of dominated options is not driven by
the complexity of the enrollment interface but by a more fundamental challenge of sensibly comparing
the economic value of different plan options. Faced with plans that are difficult to compare, due in large
part to deficits in basic insurance literacy, individuals might be expected to choose randomly— instead
we find consistent patterns in choice that seem to reflect recognition of the trade-off between plan price
and plan coverage. That the healthiest and sickest individuals sort themselves into the least, and most,
generous of plans, without much consideration for the overall differences in plan value (i.e., the
comparison between differences in coverage and average plan costs), suggests that individuals may be
employing a heuristic choice strategy in which individuals sort into available plans based on perceived
need and the marginal differences in plan prices but not a full financial comparison of plans. Such a
strategy, while potentially reasonable when menus are fairly priced to the individuals, leads to costly poor
choice in the presence of menus with dominated options. The possibility of such heuristics is hinted at
by a range of studies that have demonstrated the sensitivity of choices to the configuration, or framing
of the choice menu (e.g., Tversky and Kahneman 1974; Slovic 1995; Ariely, Loewenstein, and Prelec
2003), research that suggests that, in the absence of fully formed preferences, individuals may rationally
infer the appropriate choice from the information contained in the choice menu (Kamenica 2008; Prelec,

24

Wernerfelt, Zettelmeyer 1997, Kamenica, 2008), or may be drawn to relatively salient choices in such a
menu (Bordalo, Gennaioli, and Shleifer 2012).
SECTION 5. UNDERSTANDING THE PRICING OF PLAN OPTIONS
A natural question is why a firm would offer its employees dominated health insurance options.
All the evidence we have is that they were unaware of doing so. In this section we speculate about how
this happened, proposing that the provision of dominated options was a natural consequence of
substantial adverse selection, average cost pricing, and the expansion in plan choice over narrow ranges
of cost-sharing.
5.1 Actuarial Practice and Average Cost Pricing
In establishing the build-your-own platform, the firm partnered with an actuarial/healthinsurance consulting firm to help price the plan options. As Handel (2013) notes, the standard actuarial
practice for plan pricing centers around the calculation of average insurer costs (i.e., covered insurance
payouts) across plan options. Handel (2013) studied the evolution of plan pricing at a large firm and
concluded that the considerable adverse selection in initial employee plan choice combined with price
adjustments updated to reflect average-cost differences caused certain plans, which were not initially
dominated, to become financially dominated as pricing gradients widened.
Table 5 presents a series of regressions to explore the consistency of our firm’s menu with such
an average-cost pricing strategy. In the first column of the table we regress each of the 48 plan premiums
on indicators for different cost-sharing features, omitting the highest-cost sharing option in each category.
These estimates capture the marginal difference in plan price associated with each cost sharing feature.
For example, plans with $500 deductibles cost an average of $625 more than the equivalent plan with a
$1,000 deductible which is consistent with the earlier discussion of plan dominance. While the pricing
of the firm menu may reflect more complicated interactions, the simple regression, with an R-square of
0.99, explains most of the observed variation in prices across plans.
The second column of the table estimates how the average incremental cost to the insurer (i.e.,
employer) for the employees who selected that coverage is related to each cost-sharing attribute. This
regression shows how the amount of covered spending for an employee is affected by the different costsharing options. Comparing Column 2 to Column 1 confirms the large potential savings from avoiding
dominated deductibles. The estimates show, for example, that, all else equal, employees have to pay an
25

average of $625 to lower the deductible from $1,000 to $500, but such a shift would save the employees
who select that coverage an estimate of only $230 through reductions in out-of-pocket spending
(equivalently, increases in covered spending). In every case, except for the 90%-coinsurance versus 80%coinsurance comparison, the premium differences employees face for additional coverage exceed the
expected out-of-pocket savings the employee would see from that additional coverage.
The third column of the table suggests that the observed pricing appears more reasonable if one
were to rationalize premium differentials by attending to differences in the average total costs to the insurer
associated with each plan. This column reports a regression of average total medical spending covered
by the insurance on plan features for those employees selecting into each plan. The coefficients from
this regression reflect both the incremental cost to the insurer for covered health spending (Column 2),
as well as differences in total health spending between employees by plan choice. Consistent with the
adverse selection documented in Table 3, the regression implies large differences in total insurer cost for
individuals selecting additional coverage on each dimension of cost-sharing. As illustration, employees
choosing plans with $500 deductibles generated an estimated $1,211 more in total insurance costs than
those choosing higher deductibles, all else equal. A comparison of the average total insurer costs from
the final column against the corresponding employee costs reported in the first column suggests that the
large price differentials can be at least partially rationalized by differences in average cost of each plan to
the insurer. Figure 9 displays how the premiums from the firm menu reflect an approximately equal
share of covered health spending (e.g., “total premium”) paid by the employee (i.e., “employee premium”)
across plans. We estimate that, on average, this share is just over 40% across plans associated with each
cost-sharing feature.
These results suggest two intriguing implications for the economic consequences of plan choice.
First, the consequences of poor choices for less sophisticated employees could be diminished if, rather
than reflecting differences in average total cost, price differentials between plans were capped at the
average incremental cost of providing additional coverage. Such a policy would ensure that pricing would
never violate dominance.

Second, simply educating the employees to make more sensible plan

comparisons, and in this case encouraging the choice of $1,000-deductible plans, while clearly beneficial
to the employees making the largest mistakes, is likely to lead to more muted benefits if the firm adjusts
prices in accordance with average cost pricing.

26

5.2 Average-Cost Pricing and Dominated Plan Menus
The prior analysis of plan pricing offers insight into how a menu featuring expensive highcoverage plans might emerge from standard pricing practices. The emergence of a menu with plans of
widely ranging financial value additionally requires the assumption that firms are able to accurately
forecast the extent to which employees sort by health risk into plans, and, at least implicitly, that
employees would fail to recognize or negatively react to exaggerated plan prices. 26 While seemingly
reasonable, this interpretation raises the question of why dominated plan menus, of the sort we analyze
in this paper, are not more pervasive across insurance settings with significant adverse selection. While
prior work has documented the regularity that insurance menus with low-cost sharing plans tend to be
highly priced (e.g., Einav, Finkelstein and Cullen 2010; Handel 2013), we are not aware of evidence that
menus with severely dominated plan options are widespread.
A potential explanation for this puzzle may be that the firm’s efforts to expand employee choice
through the “build-your-own” plan regime was overly ambitious. The plan menu generated by the firm
permitted employees to choose between plans that differed only in their deductible, while most employersponsored plans bundle together multiple cost-sharing features. The consequence of such plan flexibility
is that employees were permitted to sort across plans which differed in cost-sharing only along the narrow
dimension of a deductible. In the presence of average-cost pricing, expected differences in health
spending across employees by deductible choice, due to sorting by health risk, would generate large
differences in plan prices that could easily lead to dominated pricing. In traditional settings, where
differences in deductibles are typically associated with differences in other cost-sharing attributes (e.g.,
MOOP), price differentials driven by anticipated employee sorting can be supported by a wider range in
cost-sharing, and, as such, are less likely to yield dominated plan menus.
As a simple illustration of this point, consider if our firm had only offered the two plans with
greatest and lowest cost-sharing (i.e., Plan 48 and Plan 1). Suppose employees presently choosing the
$350 or $500 deductible, would sort into Plan 1 ($350 deductible, $1,500 MOOP, 90% Coinsurance, and
$15 Copay) under the new regime, and that those presently with $750 or $1,000 deductibles would sort
into Plan 48 ($1,000 deductible, $3,000 MOOP, 80% Coinsurance, $25 copay), Based on the
counterfactual estimates of plan spending, the firm’s share of average health-care spending would be
$3,847 for Plan 1 and $1,849 for Plan 48. If the firm required employees to pay premiums that cover

26 Given the wealth of information actuarial consulting firms have about health-care use across plans they help to design and administer
for different companies, it is not particularly surprising to us that they would have good projections that capture the type of risk sorting
we see here.

27

40% of their expected covered spending (consistent with Figure 9), this would suggest a premium
difference of $799 between the two plans. For the individuals sorting into Plan 1 over Plan 48, the
marginal difference in health spending that would be covered would be, on average, $622. Although the
differential price of $799 for Plan 1 would far exceed its expected value, Plan 48 would not dominate
Plan 1 in this scenario since the maximum potential reduction in out-of-pocket spending for the employee
is over $2,500 and, indeed, 28% would benefit ex-post from enrollment into the more expensive plan.
SECTION 6. IMPLICATIONS FOR ANALYSIS OF INSURANCE MARKETS
A significant literature has emerged which analyzes consumer choices in insurance markets, and
health-insurance markets in particular, using individual-level data on observed choices from plan menus
that vary in both price and cost-sharing provisions (see Einav, Finkelstein and Levin, 2010 and Einav and
Finkelstein, 2011 for reviews). While the observed menu offered to the employees in our analysis is
unique for having many dominated options—indeed, it is such uniqueness which permits us the rare
opportunity to cleanly evaluate plan choice quality—we believe that the economic and psychological
factors identified in this setting are widespread. With respect to firm behavior, in the previous section
we documented that the prices we observe are consistent with the common practice of average-cost
pricing coupled with a particular manner of implementing the also common trend towards expanding the
choices available to consumers. With respect to consumer choice, the willingness of our employees to
choose low deductible plans is consistent with prior studies in which employees have shown a strong
preference for more generous plan coverage (Einav, Finkelstein and Cullen 2010). 27

Moreover, the

relative insensitivity to price differentials we document in Experiment 3, where individuals made choices
involving dominated menus, is quite close to estimates from Einav, Finkelstein and Cullen (2010), in
which employees made choices from plans which did not feature strict financial domination. To clarify
the implications of our study for the broader literature, we use the graphical framework developed by
Einav, Finkelstin and Cullen (2010) to show how choice predictions from standard insurance models
differ once we permit consumers to make decisions which reflect a more heuristic choice process broadly
consistent with the patterns we observe.

27 The authors document that nearly half of Alcoa employees were willing to pay $570 additional premium to lower their in-network
deductible from $500 to $0 (and out-of-network deductible from $1,000 to $500) and that this willingness was efficient, ex-post, for about
6% of employees.

28

6.1 Analysis of Insurance Markets within Standard Model
The standard approach in the literature on insurance demand starts from a canonical model in which
individuals select insurance coverage based on their anticipated risk and preference for risk aversion.
Willingness to pay for insurance in the standard model emerges from the value of reducing the variance
of spending. Following the exposition and notation in Handel and Kolstad (forthcoming), we can denote
an individual’s utility for a health-insurance plan as:
∞

𝑢𝑢𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 = � 𝑓𝑓𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 �𝑠𝑠�𝜑𝜑𝑗𝑗 , 𝜇𝜇𝑘𝑘 �𝑢𝑢�𝑊𝑊𝑘𝑘 − 𝑃𝑃𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 − 𝑠𝑠, 𝛾𝛾𝑘𝑘 �𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑
0

where 𝑢𝑢𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 is individual k’s utility under plan j, 𝑃𝑃𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 is the premium the individual must pay for the plan,

𝑊𝑊𝑘𝑘 is initial wealth, 𝑓𝑓𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 �𝑠𝑠�𝜑𝜑𝑗𝑗 , 𝜇𝜇𝑘𝑘 � is the probability density of out-of-pocket costs for the individual in
that plan -- which depends on the cost-sharing provisions of the plan (𝜑𝜑𝑗𝑗 ) and the individual’s ex-ante

health risk (𝜇𝜇𝑘𝑘 ) -- and 𝛾𝛾𝑘𝑘 is the individual’s coefficient of risk aversion. The standard approach

assumes that individuals select the available plan which maximizes utility given accurate beliefs about
the financial consequences of choices and ex-ante health risk.

In Panel A of Figure 10 we present a graphical analysis following Einav, Finkelstein and Cullen (2010)
based on a very simple simulation of choices over two health plans that vary only in deductible, with
options of $1,000 or $500. We assume that all costs above the deductible are fully covered, individuals
have private information about their probability of experiencing a health shock (𝜋𝜋𝑘𝑘 ~𝑈𝑈[0.01,0.99]), and
that total medical spending (covered + cost-share) is $3,500 when a health shock occurs and $0 otherwise.
While this process is clearly a rough approximation of that which might generate true medical spending,
it is meant to reflect a realistically wide variation in underlying health risk of consumers. Finally, we
assume that individuals have CARA utility functions, with coefficient of absolute risk aversion parameters
(independent of health-shock probabilities), 𝛾𝛾𝑘𝑘 ~𝑈𝑈[0.0001, 0.003], which implies both high degrees of

risk aversion on average and substantial heterogeneity in risk aversion. 28 We draw 20,000 combinations

of risk type and risk aversion from these distributions and then record which of the two plans the
individual would choose based on the expected utility formula above for a range of plan price differences.
The first panel of the figure corresponds to the analysis in Einav, Finkelstein and Cullen (2010) and
shows both a downward sloping demand curve and also a downward sloping incremental average cost
curve, which reflects the adverse selection that occurs when people select coverage based partly on
28 The mean risk aversion parameter from that distribution matches the average estimated coefficient of absolute risk aversion required to
rationalize health-plan selections in Handel and Kolstad’s (forthcoming) baseline case before accounting for informational frictions and
inertia.

29

information about their health risk. Point A in the figure represents the efficient level of insurance where
marginal cost equals demand. Since everyone in the simulation is risk averse and has accurate beliefs
about their expected health risk, willingness to pay is always at least as high as the expected marginal cost
of the additional insurance. If price levels converge in equilibrium to the average incremental cost of
additional insurance coverage, the equilibrium will instead be at point B in the figure, resulting in a
deadweight loss due to the distortion of adverse selection on prices given by the shaded region in the
figure. The potential equilibrium price is $340, which reflects that the probability of a health shock is on
average 0.68 for those purchasing the additional $500 in coverage (340=0.68*500).
While this equilibrium is the primary focus of the analysis in Einav, Finkelstein and Cullen (2010),
the figure also highlights that in situations where individuals choose plans that vary in their degree of
cost-sharing, the difference in the total average cost of providing insurance to groups selecting the
different plans can be much higher than the average incremental cost of additional insurance. In the
graph we see that at the potential equilibrium point B, the average total cost of providing insurance to
those with the lower deductible, point D, is much higher at $1,460. The difference in average total cost
reflects not only the expected additional insurance coverage ($340) but also the difference in coverage
that would have occurred at the higher deductible for these groups ($2,500 in spending multiplied by
group-level average differences in the probability of a health-shock). It is possible that in the absence of
regulation or other price controls that market forces or standard actuarial prices might push price
differences toward these average total cost differences. However, as we see in the graph, if prices rise
the market will quickly unravel to point C, where no one purchases the lower deductible, since rational
consumers here will never pay for coverage at dominated prices. Achieving a point like Z, which reflects
our empirical and survey findings, is simply not possible within the standard framework.
This discussion highlights the relevance of our study for understanding the dynamics of risk sorting
that we might observe in competitive markets or employees-sponsored plans where individuals are asked
to choose plans that vary in their cost-sharing. Rothschild and Stiglitz (1976), and the research that
followed, highlighted that competitive insurance markets could exist even in the presence of adverse
selection by allowing different risk types to sort into separate contract options that reflect their differences
in risk. However, this work also warned that with too much risk-heterogeneity in the population, offering
many options might lead the market to unravel. With only very small differences in cost-sharing (e.g,.
deductible differences of $500), standard theory would predict the impossibility of supporting an
equilibrium in which there is substantial sorting by risk type. In order for such an equilibrium to emerge,
high-risk consumers would have to be willing to pay extreme costs for only modest expansions in
30

coverage. The choice patterns we observe suggest that high-risk individuals may lack sophistication in
their evaluation of plans and that poor choice quality may lead to stable separating equilibria even over
very small cost-sharing differences. 29 If true, in the absence of regulation on pricing or other risk-pooling
transfers, sophisticated 0healthy consumers may be able to avoid cross-subsidizing less healthy individuals
who are unsophisticated about insurance without sacrificing much in the way of insurance coverage.
6.2 Incorporating Heuristic Choice into the Analysis of Insurance Markets
Standard insurance models are unlikely to predict the existence of equilibrium points such as Z in
Figure 10. Handel and Kolstad (forthcoming) incorporate a range of informational frictions into the
standard model and discuss how such amendments have implications for welfare analysis. However, the
informational frictions they introduce are not likely to rationalize the choices we observe given that
employees and experimental subjects violate dominance even in the face of transparent differences across
contracts that vary on simple cost-sharing dimensions. The high willingness to pay for low deductibles
and low elasticity of demand with respect to price could potentially be rationalized given substantial noise
in how consumers evaluate cost-sharing features, yet such noise would also suggest a lack of correlation
between choices and risk types. We present an alternative strategy for amending the standard model
which is more consistent with the heuristic-choice process suggested by our experimental evidence.
While this is not a formal modeling exercise and we doubt the simple model here captures the more
complicated psychology underlying actual decisions, it offers insights into how the incorporation of
heuristic choice strategies may substantially influence the analysis of insurance markets.
Drawing on the findings from our experiments, we first assume that consumers are largely, but not
completely, inattentive to price differences when making plan choices but fairly sensitive to their risk
type. A simple way to model this process is to assume that the perceived expected utility of a plan option
is a convex combination of the actual expected utility of the plan and the expected utility of the plan
under the naïve (and inaccurate) assumption that prices reflect actuarially fair cost to the employee. Under
this assumption the perceived utility of a plan choice is:
∞

𝑢𝑢�𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 = (1 − 𝜃𝜃)𝑢𝑢𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 + 𝜃𝜃 � 𝑓𝑓𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 �𝑠𝑠�𝜑𝜑𝑗𝑗 , 𝜇𝜇𝑘𝑘 �𝑢𝑢�𝑊𝑊𝑘𝑘 − 𝑃𝑃�𝑗𝑗 − 𝑠𝑠, 𝛾𝛾𝑘𝑘 �𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑
0

A further important consequence of these dynamics is that apparent stability of health-insurance markets could be highly misleading. In
particular, if one were able to introduce an effective decision aid into a situation like the one we observe, we would likely see a massive and
rapid change in consumer choices. It may be, then, that markets that appear initially stable may collapse and unravel suddenly if
unsophisticated consumers are better informed about available options.

29

31

where 𝑃𝑃�𝑗𝑗 is the actuarial fair price to the consumers for the coverage in the population and the
parameter 𝜃𝜃 is a price-inattention parameter that lies between 0 and 1. 30 As 𝜃𝜃 goes to 1 individuals use

only a simplifying heuristic where they do not need to evaluate the actual prices of policies and instead
for any given risk-aversion level can simply choose based on their ex-ante risk type.

In Panel B of Figure 10 we present the results of a simulation of this model using the same parameters
as the analysis in our standard-model simulation but incorporating a 𝜃𝜃 of 0.85, which is chosen so that
the observed demand passes through point Z on the curve. Because individuals are still sorting largely
based on ex-ante health risk, the observed incremental average cost remains downward sloping and is in

fact very close to the average cost curve from the standard model. The difference, however, is that
inattention to price causes the demand curve to be very steep. In this example, if one were to apply the
type of analysis developed by Einav, Finkelstein and Cullen (2010) to choices produced by this heuristic
choice process, one would estimate the efficient quantity of insurance at point A’ and the equilibrium
price at B’. The measured welfare loss (shaded region) would suggest an average welfare loss of $2.93
per individual. However, the true welfare loss at this point, as measured from the underlying model
parameters (i.e., WTP from the original equation), would instead be $16.42. The standard analysis would
understate welfare losses by a factor of five, primarily because the price-insensitive demand curve leads
one to conclude that the efficient level of insurance is much lower than it actually is.
While our analysis, and this example in particular, point to the importance of understanding the role
of decision heuristics and biases in the choice of insurance, Panels A and B also offer simple indicators
to which researchers can appeal to identify when non-standard preferences are likely to be critical for
analysis. The first, and most obvious, indicator is when estimated demand curves predict violations of
dominance. A second, more subtle, indication that consumer biases may be strongly influencing decisions
is when the efficient level of insurance (MC = D) projected by an analysis like this does not involve full
insurance. Indeed, a setting in which a substantial share of consumers value insurance less than its
marginal cost—a pattern that appears to characterize the employees in the analysis reported by Einav,
Finkelstein and Cullen (2010)—implies that such consumers are either risk-loving or suffer from
inaccurate beliefs regarding their health risk. 31

30 This type of behavioral model where utility is a convex combination of the standard model and a biased utility level is common in the
behavioral economics literature (see DellaVigna, 2009 for a review), and this particular formulation shares much in common with the
cursedness framework of Eyster and Rabin (2005)
31 This assumes that the analysis measures marginal cost based only on insured claim differences and not other inputs to claims-processing
costs, which is consistent with our example here and the empirical analysis in Einav, Finkelstein, and Cullen (2010).

32

SECTION 7. CONCLUSION
Our principle contribution is to document widespread and costly violations of dominance in the
health-insurance decisions of a large and diverse sample of U.S. employees. Unlike most prior work, our
paper is able to transparently assess choice quality without making assumptions about risk preferences or
beliefs, by analyzing employee choice from a standardized plan menu with a large share of financially
dominated options. For the majority of employees who chose dominated plans—a disproportionate
share of whom were of low income—the adverse financial consequences of poor choice outweigh the
estimated benefits of recent policy measures (e.g., the effect of the exchange on insurance premiums, or
the penalty associated with the individual mandate) that have attracted far more policy attention.
Our initial results prompted us to address the question of why employees make such
disadvantageous decisions. Through a series of online experiments with hypothetical choices modeled
on the firm’s plan menu, we find evidence for a modest role of search/menu complexity and much larger
role of low health literacy.

Confirming other research, we find widespread deficits in employee

understanding of the insurance choices they face. Even with simple menus with few options, we observed
significant errors in plan choice, suggesting that plan choice is difficult to improve. The online studies
suggest that poor choice may partly reflect a heuristic understanding of health insurance such that
consumers sort into plans based on perceived health risk and inferences about plan generosity from the
rank-ordering of plan deductibles rather than a careful assessment of financial plan value.
The promise of recent reforms that expand choice and aim to increase provider competition is
premised on the assumption—challenged by our research—that enrollees will make sensible plan choices.
While efforts to improve choice through simplification, education, and other modifications to the choice
environment may improve the quality of decisions, our results suggest value in shifting focus from helping
consumers navigate complicated insurance options to simplifying and standardizing the options
themselves. At the extreme, if all firms offered identical products, then competition would be far more
likely to focus exclusively on price and quality. Beyond implications for policy, our study asserts that
traditional attempts to infer risk preferences from health insurance choices may be misguided. Rather
than reflecting rational deliberations involving cost, need, and risk, many health plan choices likely reflect
heuristic choice strategies grounded in a fundamental deficit of health plan literacy.

Total Medical Expenses
Notes: This figure shows the schedule of employee spending as a function of total medical expenses by deductible
levels for contracts with $2,500 out-of-pocket max (above the deductible), 80% coinsurance above the deductible
and $25/$35 copayments (which did not count against deductible or out-of-pocket max). Employee spending
includes both the out-of-pocket medical expenditures and premium expenses. To facilitate comparison we norm the
annual employee premium for the $1,000 deductible contract to zero such that the point where the schedules for the
other deductible options intersect the y-axis reflects the additional yearly premium charge for those plans relative to
the $1,000 deductible option.

Notes: Panel A shows the fraction of subjects choosing the $1,000 deductible for each of the
treatment groups in the experiment. The baseline pricing matches the price levels for Plans 46,
34, 22, and 10 (listed in Table 1). The less expensive treatment lowers the price differentials
between lower deductibles and the $1,000-deductible option by 25%, while the more expensive
treatment increases the price differentials by 25%. Panel B shows the correlation of choice
with self-reported health status. The percent of subjects reporting each health-status level is
given in parenthes. Bars indicate +1/-1 standard error intervals.
