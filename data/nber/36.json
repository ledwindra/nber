    "abstract": "\n\nThis working paper is a draft of a chapter in a larger manuscript which is concerned with the time series variations in fertility in the United States since 1920. This chapter asks how economic models of fertility aid our understanding of our demographic history. Thus little attention is given here to the suitability of economic models for the explanation of cross-sectional fertility differentials.\n\n",
