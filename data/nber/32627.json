    "abstract": "\n\nThis article addresses developments in the literature on The Rise of Market Power. First, it summarizes research about the result of De Loecker 2020 that the sales-weighted  average markup has increased in the United States. Second, it summarizes and evaluates a set of industry studies that examine market power over long time horizons in specific settings.  A theme that emerges from these industry studies is that technological advancements matter a great deal for the evolution of economic outcomes. By contrast, the studies do not point to weak antitrust enforcement as contributing to greater market power. The article concludes by outlining directions for future research.\n\n",
    "acknowledgement": "\nI regularly consult with antitrust authorities and private companies on antitrust matters, and some of those consulting relationships are confidential. In 2022, I testified on behalf of the United States about the Northeast Alliance of American Airlines and JetBlue Airlines. I have had no consulting relationship in the past three years related to the other industries discussed in this article.
