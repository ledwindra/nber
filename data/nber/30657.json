    "abstract": "\n\nIn 2017, \u201cThe Big Three\u201d institutional investors launched campaigns to increase gender diversity on corporate boards. We estimate that their campaigns led American corporations to add at least 2.5 times as many female directors in 2019 as they had in 2016. Firms increased diversity by identifying candidates beyond managers\u2019 existing networks and by placing less emphasis on candidates\u2019 executive experience. Firms also promoted more female directors to key board positions, indicating firms\u2019 responses went beyond tokenism. Our results highlight index investors\u2019 ability to effectuate broad-based governance changes and the important impact of investor buy-in in increasing corporate-leadership diversity.\n\n",
