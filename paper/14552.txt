ABSTRACT
This paper is an attempt to assess the existence and magnitude of local research spillovers in France.
We rely on the model of an extended production function (Cobb-Douglas and Translog) with both
local and neighborhood R&D capital stocks. We estimate this model on 312 employment areas as
of 1999, first for the whole economy, then separately for five large manufacturing industries. The estimated
elasticities of productivity with respect to R&D capital are significant and plausible, both within own-area
and across neighboring areas as well as within own-industry, but they are weaker across different industries.

Introduction
Assessing the local spillover impacts of firms’ R&D investments on the various

dimensions of economic development: productivity, employment, innovation, …, both in the
geographic area where they are located and in neighboring areas, is one the most difficult and
important challenge of recent empirical investigations in the economics of research and
innovation1. Since the seminal book of KRUGMAN [1991] and the renewal of economic
geography, these issues and the related ones of understanding the determinants and
consequences of the localization and agglomeration of firms’ activities have received
increasing attention. Firms tend to locate where the factors of production are abundant and
less expensive, or where the demand for their products is strongest. They have, however, to
balance production costs and costs of transportation. Many authors recognize that various
types of externalities play also a major role in the localization of firms, arising from particular
historical and geographical contexts, from policies of regional planning, from the
agglomeration of natural, human and other economic resources, and in particular from that of
specific knowledge assets leading to local increasing returns.

As emphasized by GRILICHES [1992], the search for knowledge spillovers is
specially challenging. While other externalities can be assessed more or less directly, even if
not easily, knowledge spillovers are not directly observed. Economists can only strive to
measure the effects of knowledge flow and stock variables on outcome variables like numbers
of innovations or patents, and labor or total factor productivity. A related and difficult issue is
to assess the spatial extent of knowledge spillovers. Other major problems are encountered in
1

See AUDRETSCH, FELDMAN [2004] for a survey, and AUTANT-BERNARD, MAIRESSE, MASSARD

[2007] for a summary account of recent empirical studies published in a special issue of Papers in Regional
Science on “Spatial Knowledge Diffusion through Collaborative Networks”.

trying to understand and analyze the underlying channels and “mechanisms” by which they
operate, and the conditions allowing firms to benefit from them2.

In this exploratory econometric analysis, we basically try to identify local
knowledge spillovers by estimating the effects of firms’ R&D investments on productivity at
the aggregate level of some 300 French employment areas for 1999. We do so by relying on
the framework of an extended production with both local and neighborhood R&D capital
stocks, in addition to the more traditional factors of production of labor and physical capital3.
We specify this production function both as a simple Cobb-Douglas function and a more
general Translog function, and we estimate it for the French economy as a whole as well as
for five large manufacturing industries. On the basis of this framework and our data, we can
distinguish between local R&D spillovers within the range of employment areas themselves
and within the range of neighboring areas. We thus focus on estimating as our two main
parameters of interest the elasticities of productivity with respect to R&D capital, both
“within own-area” and “across neighboring areas”: first for the whole economy in Section 3,
and then separately by manufacturing industry in Section 4. In this last Section, we also try to
distinguish between local R&D spillovers “within own-industry” and “across other
industries”.

Although our results remain exploratory, they are surprisingly encouraging, leading
to estimates of R&D capital elasticities both within own-area and across neighboring areas
which are statistically significant and seem economically plausible. Local spillovers thus

usefulness as well as many of the conceptual, measurement and econometric issues it raises, see the seminal
article of GRILICHES [1979].

extend largely beyond the average range of employment areas, but they also appear to be
limited to neighboring employment areas that does not reach farther than an average of 100
km. We also find evidence that local spillovers tend to be mostly industry specific, with
significant estimates for R&D capital elasticities within own-industry in all five
manufacturing industries, and significant ones for elasticities across other industries for two
industries out of the five: consumption goods and equipment goods industries.

Before turning in Sections 3 and 4 to the detailed presentation of our results, we
have in Section 2 to explain briefly the construction of the data at the level of the French
employment areas in 1999, and comment on some the descriptive statistics for our main
variables, stressing in particular the extreme geographical concentration of R&D firms’
investments.

Data and main descriptive statistics

2.1

Construction of the necessary data at the level of French employment

areas for 1999

Many previous studies in order to assess the importance of geographical knowledge
spillovers have been relying on regional or departmental data4. We investigate this issue here

4

See for example CICCONE [2002], GAMBARDELLA, MARIANI, TORRISI [2002], or AUTANT-

BERNARD, LESAGE [2008].

for France at more detailed geographical level which is a priori preferable, that of the
“employment areas (“bassins d’emploi”).

The data we use relate to the non-agricultural business sector excluding financial
activities and interim employment, for “Metropolitan” France without Corsica5. They are
constructed at the level of “employment areas” for the year 1999. Employment areas are
economic zones where local firms are likely to hire their workers. They have been precisely
defined by INSEE and the Ministry of Labor, first in 1983 and then revised in 1994, on the
basis of statistics on residence-to-work displacements6. Employment areas are much smaller
than regions and departments (which correspond respectively to the NUTS 2 and NUTS 3
levels of the European Union classification). There are 341 of them in Metropolitan France
(without Corsica), of which we retain only 312 in our analysis, after discarding 29 as
unsuitable because they had no or very small R&D investments or very low employment
levels (with an estimated R&D capital stock of less than 100 K€, or with less than 5 000
workers)7.

Our R&D data come from the annual surveys conducted by the Ministry of Research,
which give detailed information on firms’ internal and external R&D expenditures, numbers
of R&D employees, financial sources, … These individual data are allocated to one of the
36 000 French local municipalities on the basis of the postal code (ZIP code) of the firms’
main laboratories, and then aggregated at the level of the employment areas. Finally, using
5

Financial activities and interim employment are excluded for lack of good coverage in the administrative data

we use. Corsica is left out because of geographical distance and its insular situation (and very little R&D
investments).
6

See INSEE [1994].

7

10 employment areas are excluded on the basis of these two criteria, 13 only on that of very small R&D

investment, and 6 of very small employment.

here only the internal R&D expenditures obtained for the six years 1993 – 1998, and applying
the so called permanent inventory method with a 15% depreciation rate, we can construct an
R&D capital stock K at the beginning of 1999 for all employment areas. (See Appendix A for
more details.) In order to investigate the spatial range of local spillovers beyond the
employment areas, besides measuring the local R&D capital stocks K, we have also computed
so called “neighborhood R&D capital stocks” such as K100 or K200. For a given
employment area, these are simply computed as the sums of the R&D capital stocks K of all
their neighboring employment areas in a “circle” of 100 km or 200 km. (See also Appendix A
for more details.)

The employment data come from the firms’ declarations to the Social Security (i.e.
the Déclarations Annuelles de Données Sociales or DADS). Being separately available for the
different firms’ establishments, they can be merged into an INSEE database constructed at the
establishment level which provides other economic key variables for 1999: total sales, value
added, gross earning before interests and taxes, and the book value of fixed assets8.
Establishments being localized at the municipality level, these variables are aggregated at the
level of the employment areas as in the case of R&D. The General Census of Population of
1999 is also a source of complementary information at the level of municipalities and
employment areas.9

8

In fact this establishment database is constructed on the basis of firm level statistics. For mono-establishment

firm, this evidently raises no difficulties, but for multi-establishments firms this has been achieved by using,
various methods of imputation based on very detailed industry ratios by establishment size and localization.
9

See JULIA [2003] for more detailed explanations on these aspects of the construction of our database.

2.2

Main descriptive statistics

Table 1 gives the mean, standard deviation, minimum, median and maximum, as
computed over the 312 employment areas, for the main variables in our investigation. It
shows the very large dispersion and skewness (asymmetry) of most of these variables in
absolute levels (that is before being normalized by size and being taken in logs). While the
surface (S) of the largest employment area (Toulouse) is already 140 times that of the smallest
one (Vitry-sur-Seine) and the mean surface (1600km2) is about 10% higher than the median
surface (1430km2), the employment (L) of the largest employment area (Paris) is of about 190
times that of the smallest one (Gannat), and the mean employment (40160) is about twice the
median employment (20510). These two max-to-min and mean-to-median ratios are even
larger for value-added (Y) and physical capital (C) than for employment, and even much more
so for local R&D capital (K) and our preferred measure of neighborhood R&D capital
(K100). As could be expected, however, when we normalize by employment size and
consider labor productivity (Y/L), physical capital intensity (C/L), and local and
neighborhood R&D capital intensities (K/L and K100/L), we see that their distributions
across employment areas appear much less dispersed and skewed. Going one step further and
taking logarithms which is what do when estimating the Cobb-Douglas and Translog
production functions regressions, we can also see that their log-distributions become roughly
symmetrical.

Table 1: Main Descriptive Statistics (ABOUT HERE)

The distributions of the local and neighborhood Log R&D capital stocks per
employee [Log(K/L) and Log(K100/L)] remain nonetheless very dispersed across the
employment areas, as compared to Log labor productivity [Log(Y/L)] and to Log physical
capital stock per employee [Log(K/L)]. This corresponds to an extremely high concentration
of firms R&D activities in a few zones. This geographical concentration of R&D activities is
particularly striking since it much more pronounced than that of productive activities. This
appears most clearly by looking at the Lorenz curves shown in Figure 1 respectively for the
surface (S), total employment (L), value added (Y) and local and neighborhood R&D capital
(K) and (K100), and by comparing the corresponding Gini coefficients10. We can see that the
10% (i.e. the 31) largest employment areas in terms of surface, employment, value-added and
physical capital correspond to 23 %, 47 %, 53 % and again 53 % of the total surface, total
employment, total value-added and physical capital respectively, while the 10% largest
employment areas in terms of local and neighborhood R&D capital account respectively for
as much as 88 % of the total R&D capital stock and for as much as 71 % of the “total
neighborhood R&D capital stock”11.

Figure 1: Concentration Curves and Gini Coefficients (ABOUT HERE)

10

The Gini coefficients for physical capital (C) and value-added (Y) are nearly equal, and we cannot distinguish

their Lorenz curves (3) and (4) in Figure 1. Note also that the Lorenz curve for the neighborhood R&D capital
K100 appears less concentrated than that for local R&D capital K, because of the fact that the different
neighborhood areas are by construction greatly overlapping, and the fact that local R&D capital stocks K are
very small for most employment areas.
11

Note that because of the high concentration of R&D capital K in few employment areas in Paris, Lyon,

Toulouse, Grenoble and their neighborhood areas, and because of the important overlap of these neighborhood
areas, the mean neighborhood R&D capital K100 appears much larger (by a factor of nearly 30!) than the mean
R&D capital stock K.

Figure 2 shows the localization and importance of R&D activities in terms of
employment in the 312 employment zones in France. These activities are mainly concentrated
in the Paris region, and to a lesser extent in the Rhône-Alpes region with Lyon and Grenoble,
and in the Toulouse region, and they are quite modest or negligible in most other parts of
France. The huge concentration we already stressed in terms of R&D capital is of course also
true for R&D employment. About 90% of the R&D employees (researchers and technicians)
employed by firms are located in the 40 employment areas largest in terms of R&D
employment, and 70% in the 10 first of them: 7 in Paris Region and 3 in the province (i.e. by
decreasing order: Nanterre, Versailles, Boulogne-Billancourt, Paris, Toulouse, Lyon, Les
Mureaux, Grenoble, Saint-Denis, Vitry-sur-Seine).

Finally, Table 2 gives the Moran’s coefficients of spatial autocorrelation for our
main variables (in logs) using four different contiguity matrices12. We can see that these
spatial autocorrelation coefficients are statistically significant (at the 1% confidence interval)
for all variables and for all four contiguity matrices. They also tend to be somewhat higher
when more weight is given to close proximity, that is when they are computed with the first
contiguity matrix (W1) based on the neighboring areas, or the fourth one (W4) based on the
inverse of the squared distance. We note also that they are generally close enough for all the
variables, in the range of 0.15 to 0.25, with few exceptions. This is a relatively modest order

12

of magnitude, which is high enough, however, to warrant the use of spatial econometric
techniques.

where i denotes the employment area i (i = 1 to 312), and where our main parameters of
interest are γ1 and η1 for the Cobb-Douglas specification, together with γ2 and η2 (and
possibly γ3 and γ4) for the Translog specification13. Note that all capital stocks (C, K and
K100) are measured at the beginning of the year 1999. Note also that all the squared and cross
product Log terms in the Translog specification are taken in deviations from the
corresponding means, which implies for example that the estimated γ1 and η1 in the Translog
specification directly measure the local and neighborhood R&D capital elasticities at the
mean values of the variables, and that they should be not too different from the constant
elasticities γ1 and η1 as estimated in the Cobb Douglas specification14. Note finally that in
order to take into account the different industry structure of the employment areas, we have
included in the two Cobb-Douglas and Translog productivity equations eleven control
variables measuring the value added shares of the different industries (at the NES16
classification level) in the employment areas.
13

We have not included in the Translog specification the three cross-terms involving Log(K100/L), that is

Log(L)* Log(K100/L), Log(C/L) * Log(K100/L) and Log(K/L) * Log(K100/L), since these three variables are
strongly collinear.
14

In the Translog specification, the elasticities are not constant, but are function of the variables. For example,

the elasticity of physical capital stock is :

βˆ = β + 2β
1

2

( log ( C / L) − log ( C / L) ) + β ( log ( L) − log(L) ) + γ ( log ( K / L) − log ( K / L) )

As we have seen in the previous section, our main variables Log(Y), log(L), log(C),
log(K) and Log(K100) are not only extremely dispersed but they also exhibit spatial
autocorrelation patterns, and we can thus expect that the error terms ε in the productivity
Cobb-Douglas and Translog equations (1) and (2) are also spatially autocorrelated. To take
account of such a spatial autocorrelation, we rely on the spatial econometrics methods as
developed in ANSELIN [1988], LESAGE [2000] or LE GALLO [2002]. After various
experimentations, we have focused on the Spatial Autoregressive Regression (SAR) estimated
by maximum likelihood. The SAR specification performs better than the usual regression as
estimated by Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), that is when tested against the null hypothesis of
no spatial autocorrelation (ρ = 0). It is also performs better when tested against the Spatial
Error Model (SEM) in the framework the Spatial General Model (SGM) encompassing both
the SAR and the SEM specifications. It also does well when tested with the Spatial Durbin
Model (SDM). (See Appendix B for detailed explanations.)

Tables 3 and 4 give the results of the estimation by maximum likelihood of the
spatial autoregressive regression (SAR) for the Cobb-Douglas and Translog equations
respectively.

Table 3: Estimates of Cobb-Douglas production function with local R&D spillovers
and
Table 4: Estimates of Translog production function with local R&D spillovers
(ABOUT HERE)

Making first a few general observations, we see that for all eight different
regressions that we thought useful to document in these tables, the absence of spatial
autocorrelation is rejected at 5% level, while the Spatial Autoregressive Regression (SAR) is
accepted against the Spatial General Model (SGM). The spatial autocorrelation parameter (i.e.
the coefficient of W*Log(Y/L)) is statistically significant of the order of 0.3 to 0.4 depending
on the regressions. This can be interpreted as indirect evidence of local spillovers effects,
other than the direct evidence provided by the estimates of the R&D capital stocks elasticities.

We also observe that the general fit of the regressions are strongly improved when
we move from the Cobb-Douglas to the Translog specifications. This is mainly accounted by
the inclusion in the equations of the squared log-variables (and not by the cross-product
terms), as indicated by the likelihood ratio tests. Following the interpretation of such a result
proposed by CREPON-MAIRESSE [1993], we can view it as strong evidence of the
heterogeneity of the production function across individual units: that is for us here across
employment areas. The Translog equation takes explicitly into account such heterogeneity by
including squares and cross-product of the log-variables, contrary to the more parsimonious
Cobb-Douglas equation. Note, however, that, as could be expected, the estimates of average
elasticities (i.e., when computed at the sample means of the variables for the Translog
specification) are all practically the same for both type of equations.

We find estimates of the average elasticity of physical capital stock β̂ A , which are

both statistically very significant and of a reasonable order of magnitude of 0.25 in all eight
regressions. The Translog estimates show, however, that the elasticity β is far from being
constant across employment areas, increasing strongly with physical capital intensity:
βˆ

(

)

0.23 + 0.28 log ( C L ) − log ( C L ) . We also find small but significant increasing returns to

scale ν of about 3 to 5%, which appear to be practically constant across employment areas
(contrary to β).

Turning now to our parameters of main interest: the elasticities of local and
neighborhood R&D capital, we see first that in all eight regressions the average elasticity of
local R&D capital γ̂ A is as statistically significant as the average elasticity of physical capital

β̂ A , and about equal to 0.03. Such an order of magnitude, which may seem small, is in fact on
the high side of what could be expected. The similar cross-sectional estimates of R&D capital
elasticity performed at the firm level for samples of R&D doing firms in manufacturing
industries are in the range of 0.05 to 0.1015. Considering that only a minority of firms do
R&D, a simplistic guess would be that at the aggregate level of employment areas, the
estimated elasticity of local R&D capital would be a great deal smaller. Finding that it is
actually of about 0.03 is clear evidence for the existence of sizeable R&D spillovers within
employment areas. The Translog estimates show that the elasticity γ, like β, is not constant
across employment areas but is strongly increasing with the intensity of local R&D capital:
γˆ

(

)

0.03 + 0.02 log ( K L ) − log ( K L ) .

Looking next at the estimates of the average elasticity η̂ A of neighborhood R&D
capital in regressions (2), (4), (7) and (8) where we used our preferred measure K100, we see

15

See for example CREPON-MAIRESSE [1993] for such cross-sectional estimates for French manufacturing

industries. See also MAIRESSE-SASSENOU [1991] for a survey of both cross-sectional and time series types of
estimates for other countries, which remains representative of the results that can be found in recent studies.

that they are statistically significant and of nearly 0.015, half of the average elasticity

γ̂ A 16.

The Translog estimates show again that the elasticity η is not constant across employment
areas but appears to increase moderately with the intensity of the neighborhood R&D capital.
In regressions (3) and (4), we present two among the different regressions we did in order to
assess approximately the spatial range of R&D spillovers beyond employment areas, using
different measures of neighborhood R&D capital stocks K80, K150, K200 and K250
constructed as the R&D capital stocks of all employment areas in circles of increasing radius
(respectively equal to 80km, 150km, 200km and 250km). We see in regression (3) that the
average elasticity η̂ A becomes not statistically different from zero if we use the broader
definition of neighborhood R&D capital K200 instead of our preferred one K100.
Equivalently, if in addition to Log(K100/L) we include in regression (4) the variable
Log(K200-K100)/L measuring the intensity of R&D capital stocks in the neighboring
employment areas centered in the 100km to 200km ring, we see that this variable is also not
statistically different from zero.

Industry R&D Spillovers

In this section, we attempt both to confirm and be more specific about our findings
on local R&D spillovers by pursuing our analysis at the level of five large manufacturing
industries and by differentiating between own-industry and other-industry R&D spillovers.
16

Taking for K and K100 their median values (in Table 1) that only differ by 20%, this implies that the

corresponding gross rate of return of neighborhood R&D capital would be about 60% of that of local R&D
capital, which is quite high, still plausible enough.

We have been able to partition our employment area database according to the French onedigit industry classification NES 16, and we can focus on five large manufacturing industries,
leaving aside trade, transport, services, and other industries which typically invest very little
in R&D. These five broad manufacturing industries are the following: (B) Food and beverage
industries; (C) Consumption good industries; (D) Motor vehicles industries; (E) Equipment
good industries; and (F) Intermediate good industries.

We are thus now considering a much larger sample of 1538 “industry-employment
area” observations for which we computed, as we did previously for the whole economy, both
an “own-industry” local R&D capital stock (K) and an “own-industry” neighborhood R&D
stock (K100)17. To test whether we could find evidence of R&D spillovers across different
industries, we also defined an “other-industry” local R&D capital stock (Kdif), simply
computed for all industry-employment area observations as the sum of the own-industry local
R&D capital for the four other industries18.

Table 5 reports the estimates of the R&D capital stocks elasticities of interest for
three regressions of the Translog productivity equation. All three regressions include fixed
industry effects, and the results shown are the usual within-industry OLS estimates, since we
do not find anymore significant evidence in favor of the (SAR) specification in our larger
sample, once we control for industry effects. Regression (9) assumes that all parameters are

17

We deleted 22 observations (out of 5x312=1560) because of zero own industry local and neighborhood R&D

capital stocks K and K100.
18

We also computed an “other-industry” neighborhood R&D capital stock (Kdif100); however the regression

estimates of the corresponding elasticities were very small and non significant, and not worthwhile to be reported
here. The same observation applies for the estimates we obtained when we tried to include in the regressions
separately the logs of the “own-industry” local R&D capital stocks for the other industries, as four additional
separate variables instead of the log of their sum Log(Kdif).

equal across industry (except for the industry fixed effects), while regression (10) only
restricts the R&D capital elasticities to be equal across industry, and regression (11) also
allows the R&D capital elasticities to be industry specific. The within-industry OLS estimates
of regression (11) are thus the same as the OLS ones, when estimating it separately for each
five industries. The complete estimates for regression (11), including the elasticities for
physical capital, are recorded in Table C1 in Appendix C.

Table 5: Estimates of Translog production function with local and industry R&D spillovers
(ABOUT HERE)

Looking first at the χ2 tests of equality of the R&D capital stocks elasticities in
regression (11), as well as the likelihood ratio tests of the fully pooled and semi-pooled
regressions (9) and (10) against the more general regression(11), the evidence goes in favor of
the latter specification. However, it also appears that the specification of regression (10) is
mainly rejected because of very significant industry differences in the estimated elasticities of
the local R&D capital Log(K/L). Actually, the estimates of the five other R&D capital
elasticities in the Translog equation, that is for Log(Kdif/L), Log(K100/L), Log(K/L)2,
Log(Kdif/L)2 and Log(K100/L)2 are not statistically different across industry at the 5% (or
more) confidence level.

Focusing now on the magnitude of the estimates, we see that the average elasticity

γ̂ A of the local R&D capital, as estimated for all five industries in regressions (9) an (10), is
again statistically very significant (as when estimated for the overall French business non

agricultural economy in the previous section), but that it is of a much higher order of
magnitude of about 0.09 (as against 0.03 before). This important difference in size is largely
explained by the fact that we are now considering manufacturing industries only19. We also
see that the elasticity γ is not constant across industry and employment areas and that it is
increasing as before, but even more strongly, with the intensity of local R&D capital:

(

)

γ̂ = 0.09 + 0.05 log ( K L ) − log ( K L ) . We find, however, when considering regression (11),

that the estimated average elasticity γ̂ A can be quite different across industries. It is
significantly higher, of about 0.21, in the Motor vehicles industries, but falls in the range of
0.05 to 0.10 in the other industries. It is noteworthy that the average elasticity γ̂ A remains
statistically different from zero at the 1% confidence level, except in the Food industries
where it only significant at the 10% confidence level. It is also interesting to observe that the
elasticity γ tends to be significantly increasing with local R&D capital intensity Log(K/L)
even within industry.

The estimates of the average elasticity η̂ A of the neighborhood R&D capital in
regressions (9) and (10) remain statistically significant as before, but with the same order of
magnitude of 0.015 (or perhaps just slightly higher), contrary to the average elasticity
estimate γ̂ A . We also find a moderate tendency for the elasticity η to increase with the
intensity of neighborhood R&D capital. We observe in regression (11) that the industry
estimates of η do not statistically differ and are roughly constant across industries, again
contrary to the corresponding estimates γ for local R&D capital.
19

It is also explained by the related fact that γ̂ A is now measured at a different sample average value

log ( K L ) of the local R&D capital intensity, which is much higher for manufacturing industries than for the
overall business economy.

Finally, we only find weak evidence that local spillovers are not only industry
specific, but are also significant and sizeable across different industries. The estimated
elasticities of other-industry local R&D capital (Kdif) in regressions (9) and (10) are just
significant at the 5% level of confidence and of about 0.01, that is much smaller by a factor of
nearly 10 than the estimated elasticities of own-industry local R&D capital (K). In regression
(11) we see that the elasticities of other-industry local R&D capital are significant and of
about 0.02 for two industries out of the five: consumption goods and equipment goods
industries20.

Conclusion

This note is a contribution to the existing literature on the effects of local R&D
spillovers on productivity in their geographic and industrial dimensions. Our estimations of
Cobb-Douglas and Translog extended production functions with local and neighborhood
R&D capital are performed at the level of some 300 employment areas for the French non
agricultural business economy as a whole in 1999. They are also generalized for five broad
manufacturing industries, using a larger sample of some 1500 observations crossing industry
and employment area data. Even though R&D investments are very highly concentrated in a
few employment areas around Paris and other large French cities, we find statistically

20

Using data at the level of the 94 French departments for 11 manufacturing industries from 1992 to 2000,

AUTANT-BERNARD, LESAGE [2008] find evidence of stronger cross-industry effects of private R&D
activity on patenting than we do here for productivity.

significant and large but plausible spillover effects of local R&D capital on productivity. In
addition to these effects, we also find statistically significant but smaller effects for
neighborhood R&D capital in the neighboring employment areas extending on average as far
as 100km but not beyond. We also observe that these effects are not constant across
employment areas, but increase very significantly with R&D capital intensity. These findings
are strongly confirmed at the industry-employment area level, which show that local R&D
spillovers tend to be mostly industry specific, while the evidence for R&D spillovers across
different industries is much weaker.

Although surprisingly good and robust, our results should still be considered as
exploratory in view of many shortcomings related mainly to the data, and in particular its
cross-sectional nature, and the consequences in terms of econometric modeling and
estimation. Data on comparable cross-sectional employment areas data for a few number of
years, and least one more recent year than 1999 would be very useful, but the data
construction is complex and costly. An analysis at a more detail industry classification level
might also be possible, though difficult. Investigating localized data at the establishment
level, and preferably panel data, is a priori the preferable way to go; however, it also has its
own important problems.21

and estimation of the production function using micro-panel data.

Moran's coefficients of spatial autocorrelation and the z-tests of no spatial
autocorrelation are respectively shown in normal characters and in italic characters
(in parentheses). Both are distributed as the standard normal variable under the
null hypothesis of no spatial autocorrelation. Under this hypothesis the expected
value of Moran's coefficients of spatial autocorrelation is equal to (-1/N) where N is
the number of observations (i.e. = -1/312 =-0.003), and their standard errors
depend on the contiguity matrix. They are respectively 0.034 , 0.021 , 0.023 and
0.028 for W1, W2, W3 and W4.

APPENDIX A:

Measurement of local and neighborhood R&D capital variables

The R&D data we use to measure the R&D capital stocks at the employment area
level are provided by the annual surveys on firms’ R&D expenditures conducted by the
statistical office of The French Ministry of Research since the seventies. In these surveys,
since 1993, firms which have several laboratories or research centers are asked to report the
geographical decomposition of their total internal R&D expenditures and total number of
R&D workers by French “departments” (NUTS 3 level). We use this decomposition together
with the postal addresses of firms’ establishments to determine the localization of their R&D
expenditures and number of workers at the very detailed level of the some 36 000 French
“communes” or municipalities. These estimates are then summed up to the level of the 341
employment areas which are aggregates of municipalities.

The local R&D capital stocks (K) at the beginning of year 1999 are estimated by the
permanent inventory method applied on the basis of the past internal R&D expenditures (R)
so obtained for the six years 1993 – 1998, after deflation by an overall R&D price index and
after depreciation assuming a constant depreciation rate δ of 15 %, that is using the following
formula:

31

K 1999 =

1998

∑ (1 − δ)

τ =1993

1998 − τ

Rτ
PτRD

(A-1)

Note that we did not try to make any adjustment for the unknown initial stock of
R&D capital in 1993, since this should not affect noticeably our cross-sectional estimates of
the R&D capital elasticities of interest here. With a rate of depreciation δ of 15 %, it is also
the case that about 38 % of the R&D capital stock at the beginning of 1992 is not depreciated
at the beginning of 1999, which will represent about 28 % of the R&D capital stock at the
beginning of year 1999, when assuming that R&D investments have been growing at an
average annual growth rate of 5 %.

The neighborhood R&D capital stock (K100) for any given employment area is
simply computed by summing up the R&D capital stocks (K) in the employment areas which
are in a circle of 100 km around this given area. In this procedure, we assume that all the
R&D capital of an employment area is localized at its geographical center. Precisely, we have
constructed a matrix A100 which indicates if the distance between two employment areas i and
j is less then 100 km:

[ ]

A100 = ai , j

⎧1 if 0 < dist (i, j ) ≤ 100km
such that ai , j = ⎨
⎩0 otherwise

(A-2)

Denoting by K the vector of local capital stock for all employment areas and by

K100 the corresponding vector of neighborhood capital stock, we can compute simply the
latter as:

32

K100 = A100 K

(A-3)

Note that by construction the matrix A100 is symmetric and the coefficients of its
main diagonal are zeros. Note also that this matrix is not row-standardized as a classical
spatial weight matrix since K100 is defined as the sum (not the average) of the local R&D
capital stocks K for the neighboring areas.

To assess approximately the spatial range of R&D spillovers we have also considered
different measures of neighborhood R&D capital stocks, based on alternative choices of
distance between the geographical centers of an employment area and its neighboring areas.
Besides using K100, we have thus experimented with K80, K150, K200 and K250, costructed
as the R&D capital stocks of all employment areas in circles of increasing radius (respectively
equal to 80km, 150km, 200km and 250km). See Table 3 where we report different estimates
of the Cobb-Douglas productivity equation using respectively K100 and K200 alone, and both
K100 and (K200 – K100).

APPENDIX B:

Brief overview of spatial econometric methods

We use the classical spatial econometrics method developed by ANSELIN [1988],
LESAGE [2000] or LE GALLO [2002]. We can treat the error terms as a first-order spatial
autocorrelation process to give the Spatial Error Model (SEM), but we prefer to add the spatial
lag of the dependent variable as an additional explanatory variable and consider the Spatial
Autoregressive Regression (SAR), or spatial lag model. If we write y the vector of
observations on the dependent variable, X the matrix of the regressors, and W the contiguity
matrix, the (SAR) model can be written as:

y = ρWy + Xβ + ε

(B-1)

This model cannot be consistently estimated by least-squares because it includes the spatially
lagged dependent variable as a regressor. We have instead to rely on the maximum likelihood
method. Assuming normality of the error term:

(I − ρW )y − Xβ = ε ≈ N (0, σ I )
2

the log likelihood function is the following:

34

(

( )

log(2π ) − log σ 2 − log I − ρW

1 ⎡
′
− 2 ((I − ρW )y − Xβ ) ((I − ρW )y − Xβ) ⎤
⎥⎦
2σ ⎢⎣

log L ρ, β, σ 2 = −

Using the transformation proposed by ORD [1975], the log of the determinant |I – ρW| can be
computed as:

log I − ρW = ∑ log(1 − ρωi )
N

i =1

where ωi are the eigenvalues of the contiguity matrix W, which can be computed themselves
once for all in the iterative maximization procedure. The global solution for maximization of
log likelihood function is quite fast using a Matlab estimation program software adapted from
the routines provided by James LESAGE on the web site: http://www.spatialeconometrics.com/.

Following ANSELIN [1988] or ANSELIN-BERA-FLORAX-YOON [1996] and
using Lagrange multiplier tests, we perform various specification tests of the SAR
specification against other specifications. First of all, we can test the (SAR) regression for the
null of no spatial autocorrelation (ρ = 0), that is against the usual regression as estimated by
Ordinary Least Squares (OLS). We can also test the (SAR) model against a more general
model called the Spatial Generalized Model (SGM), which allows spatial autocorrelation in
the error term, and thus encompass the SEM specification as well as the SAR specification.
The SGM model can be written as:

y = ρWy + Xβ + u

with u = λWu + ε

(B-2)

35

or also as the following second order spatial autoregressive model:

y = (ρ + λ )W y + ρ λ W W y + X β − W X λ β + ε

(B-3)

with one cofactor restriction on the parameters of the spatial lagged regressors. When there is
no lagged dependent variable (ρ = 0), the spatial error model (SEM) is again obtained as:

y = λWy + Xβ − WXλβ + ε

(B-4)

Finally without the cofactor restriction, we obtain a model proposed by Durbin,
called the Spatial Durbin Model (SDM), which can be tested against the previous SEM:

y = λWy + Xβ + WXγ + ε

(B-5)

Figure B1 summarizes the relations between the usual (non spatial) regression (OLS)
and the four spatial regression models: SEM, SAR, SGM and SDM. We have tested that the
SAR specification was preferable to the OLS and SEM specifications and was an acceptable
restriction to the SGM and SDM specifications.
