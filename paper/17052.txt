Disability Pension Program and Labor Force Participation in Japan: A Historical Perspective
Takashi Oshio and Satoshi Shimizutani
NBER Working Paper No. 17052
May 2011
JEL No. H55,J26
ABSTRACT
This paper utilizes historical information to explore the relationship between labor force participation
of middle aged and old people and the disability program in Japan. In particular, we explore the time
series dimension to identify what has determined the trend in disability program participation over
time and relate it with the labor supply. We find that mortality and health measures have been largely
unrelated to the disability program participation rates. While major revisions to the disability program
have slightly expanded the eligibility for DI programs, the program participation is still very low; thus,
the effect on labor force participation is very limited in Japan, which is in contrast with some European
countries that have high take up rates, inducing early retirement.

1. Introduction

In Japan and other developed countries, disability pension programs commonly have
a long history in public pension programs. The Japanese disability pension program, which
started in 1944, has gradually expanded over several major revisions and has contributed to
improving the living standards of the disabled. Indeed, the eligibility criteria have been
generally eased, and the number of program recipients has shown a trend of modest
increase. In contrast to some European countries (Börsch-Supan, 2005), however, the
disability pension program is rarely related with labor force participation (of the elderly) in
Japan.
However, the fact that the disability pension program has so far been unlikely to be
detrimental to labor force participation in Japan does not imply that the disability pension
will not be relevant for retirement decisions in Japan. Indeed, the number of recipients of
disability pension benefits has increased in recent years. It has been established that the
aging population in Japan is growing at a remarkable speed, and the proportion of the
elderly aged 65 and over in the total population had reached 20 percent in 2005 and will
reach 30 percent in 2025 and approximately 40 percent in 2050 (National Institute of
Population and Social Security Research, 2007). In the future, together with the historically
lower fertility rate, population aging will cause a decline in the numbers of the labor force,
and the situation might be exacerbated by expanding disability program participation. From
this aspect, it is worthwhile to investigate the reason for the low take up rate in Japan,
focusing on a distinction between institutional aspects (i.e., tight eligibility conditions) and
non-institutional ones (i.e., better health conditions), which have not been sufficiently
explored in Japan.

1

To this end, this paper utilizes historical information to explore the relationship
between the disability pension program and labor force participation in Japan. In particular,
we examine the time series data to identify what has determined the trend in disability
program participation. Specifically, this paper performs two-fold analyses to separate
institutional factors from non-institutional factors accounting for program participation.
First, we provide historical information on mortality and health status measures in
Japan. A change in health status is sure to affect participation in disability insurance
programs even without any revisions. Hence, understanding the trends in health status over
time is critical to distill the effect of health conditions on the program participation. This
task is not easy, however, because there is no “true” measure of health status. Thus, we
must explore, over time, the relationships among representative measures of health,
mortality rates, and subjective health status.
Second, we attempt to understand the relationship between changes over time in the
disability program and program participation. We identify three major revisions of the
program in the post-war period and examine the relationship between these changes and the
program participation rate so that we identify how trends in the disability program have
been related with institutional revisions.
Our discussion proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides a historical overview of the
disability program in Japan, focusing on major revisions that are to be examined in later
sections. Section 3 investigates historical representative data on health status, i.e., mortality,
subjective health status, and other measures and relates them with each other in Japan.
Section 4 describes the development of labor force participation, examines the relationship
with program revisions, and quantifies the effect of the disability program revisions on
“activity” measured by labor force participation rate. The last section concludes.

2. Disability Program and other social security program reforms

2. 1 Historical overview
This section gives an overview from a historical perspective of the disability program and
other related reforms to the social security program in Japan. At the outset, we need to
clarify that what is often referred to as the “disability insurance (DI) program” in other
countries corresponds to the “disability pension program” in Japan; the program was
constructed in the public pension scheme, and all revisions to the disability program have
been linked to those to the core pension programs. Among several programs to assist the
disabled, the disability pension plays the most important role in terms of income
compensation; therefore, we will focus on the description of the disability pension program
and briefly mention related programs at the end of this section.
The Japanese public pension program consists of three programs: the Employees’
Pension Insurance (EPI; Kosei Nenkin) whose pensioners are private employees; the
National Pension Insurance (NPI; Kokumin Nenkin) whose pensioners are self-employed or
agriculture, forestry, and fishery cooperative employees; and the Mutual Aid Insurance
(Kyosai Nenkin) covering employees in the public sector and private schools. In terms of
the number of pensioners, the EPI and the NPI contribute to the total by slightly less than
half, respectively, and the MAI occupies the remaining small portion.1 We will describe
below the revisions of the disability pension program over time, focusing on the EPI and
NPI (Table 1).

See Oshio, Shimizutani, and Oishi (2010) for a detailed description of the Japanese public pension program and its
historical development.

When the EPI was launched in 1944 as the first social insurance style public pension
program, it contained the disability pension program. 2 The initial program rated the
disabled using two grades (Grade 1 and Grade 2) once qualified. The grading depended on
functional ability to perform activities of daily living, rather than on loss of earning ability.
Grade 1 referred to a condition in which a person was unable to perform activities of daily
living (e.g., severe disability affecting both hands or complete blindness). Grade 2 referred
to a condition in which a person faced very severe limitations in performing activities of
daily living (any severe disability affecting either hand). We need to pay attention to the
fact that the program insured persons with mental disorders from the beginning, via the EPI.
The revision of 1954 introduced Grade 3 to cover more disabled persons with less severe
conditions than those in Grade 2.3
After establishment in the EPI, the disability pension program has expanded in some
ways. To date, there have been four major revisions during its development. We will
consider them, focusing on who has been most affected in each revision. The first revision
was the introduction of the NPI effective in 1961. The NPI began to insure those who were
not covered by the EPI, i.e., self-employed workers and agricultural, forestry, and fishery
sector workers. The introduction of the NPI was important, as it launched the universal
pension system in the Japanese public pension program. The NPI drastically expanded the
coverage of the disability pension program to more groups than just employees in the

2
A brief review of development of the disability pension program was provided by the Ministry of Health, Labour and
Welfare (2009). The previous program of the EPI, which was called the “Workers Pension Insurance (Roudou Sha Nenkin
Hoken Seido)” was launched in 1941 and covered only male and non-office workers. In 1944, the name of the program was
changed to the EPI, and it began to cover office workers or females; this was very similar to the current system in terms of
coverage.
3
The EPI had only a single layer of a wage proportional benefit before 1954 in the old-age pension program and was
reconstructed to a double tier structure (fixed rate part as the first tier and a wage proportional part as the second tier) in
1954. Even after 1954, however, the disability pension program had a single tier structure until the 1985 revision.

private sector. Unlike the EPI, the NPI had not covered mental disease at the time of its
introduction.
The NPI had two types of disability programs for recipients with premium
contribution and for those without. The first was the “Disability Pension Program (Shogai
Nenkin),” which was designed for those who contributed the premium. The NPI was
motivated by the spirit of social insurance and thus required the recipients to contribute the
insurance premium to receive benefits. The second was the “Disability Welfare Pension
Program (Shogai Fukushi Nenkin),” which was designed for those who did not make
premium contribution. Eligibility to receive disability pension benefit was judged at the
time of the first doctor’s visit to survey the extent of the disease that made the person
disabled. Thus, those who had received the first visit before reaching the age of 20 (the
minimum age for NPI participation is 20) or before 1961 were not insured by the disability
pension program under the NPI. They were covered by the disability welfare pension
program, which was financed by the government. The eligibility for this program was
means-tested, and the amount of benefit was lower than that of the disability pension
program.
The second revision took place in 1974. It called for expanding the coverage for
mental disease. The NPI began to insure mental disorders in 1964 and mental deficiency in
1965.4 However, the coverage for mental disability was very limited. While those who
paid the premium were eligible to receive the disability pension benefits once qualified as
Grade 1 or 2 (note that there was no Grade 3 in the NPI), the disability welfare program
insured the disabled only if rated as Grade 1. In 1974, the disability welfare program began

4

In 1966, the NPI began to cover all diseases including liver and kidney diseases among other internal disorders.

5

to cover Grade 2 as well, and many patients with mental disorders or deficiencies became
eligible to receive the benefit.
The third revision was implemented as a part of the major revision of core public
pension programs in 1985 (effective from 1986). This revision was most drastic in recent
years, as it harmonized all the public pension programs into an integrated form (see Oshio,
Oishi, and Shimizutani, 2010). It reduced the benefit multiplier and flat-rate benefit in the
old age pension program for the first time, aiming to restrain an increase in total pension
benefits. Three revisions were implemented with respect to the disability pension programs.
First, a double tier structure was introduced. The NPI pensioners, both with and
without premium contributions, were entitled to receive (1) the flat rate “Disability Basic
Pension (Shogai Kiso Nenkin)” benefit as the first tier, which was linked to the Basic
Pension Benefit, and (2) the wage proportional “Disability Employees’ Pension (Shogai
Kosei Nenkin)” program as the second tier. The Disability Welfare Pension, which was
funded by the government before the revision, was replaced by the Disability Basic Pension,
which was funded by the government and premium contributions of the NPI pensioners.
Second, the benefits for the disabled without premium contribution were raised to be
at the same level as those for the disabled with premium contribution in the NPI. Both
groups of the disabled were entitled to receive the same Disability Basic Pension benefit,
and the amount doubled for the recipients of the disability welfare pension benefit. This is a
remarkable revision for those who received the disability welfare pension, given that the
1985 revision reduced old age pension benefits in general.
Third, grading of disability conditions was harmonized across programs. Before the
revision, there was disparity in qualification criteria for the disabled even if the disability
condition was the same. However, even after the harmonization of the grading, the

6

Disability Basic Pension covered the disabled only in Grades 1 and 2. The EPI program
covers the disabled in Grade 3 too and provides “disability compensation” for a disabled
pensioner with a disability less severe than Grade 3 if the disabled condition is fixed.5
Lastly, the government allowed the Disability Basic Pension recipients aged 65 years
or above to additionally receive EPI benefits if they had made any EPI contributions in the
past. This revision became effective as of 2006, most probably providing the elderly with
incentives to apply for disability pension benefits.
In sum, the disability pension programs in Japan have a long history starting in 1944.
The disability pension program for private firm employees (EPI pensioners) was introduced
relatively early and was generous in that it covered mental diseases as well as patients who
were less severely disabled. The coverage of the disability pension has expanded. From
1961, NPI pensioners were entitled to receive the disability pension benefits, a move that
included the self-employed. From 1974, the disabled without premium contribution were
entitled to receive the benefits if rated as Grade 2, thus including many persons who were
mentally deficient or had mental disorders. From 1986, the disabled without contribution
were entitled to receive the disability basic pension benefit, which was same as for those
with contribution. Finally, the Disability Pension Benefit recipients with any EPI
contributions were entitled to additionally receive EPI benefits in 2006.
Despite the domestic expansion, however, the size of the disability pension benefit is
still relatively small in terms of economic size and public expenditure from an international
perspective. According to OECD’s Social Expenditure Database, the share of the
expenditure on disability pension benefits out of GDP was 0.3 percent in Japan in 2005,

5

Since the EPI pensioners were required to join the NPI in the 1985 reform, the entitlement to receive disability pension
became contingent on the grading of the NPI (Disability Basic Pension), even if a disabled person had been approved to
receive disability pension benefits in the EPI or MAI program. The MAI program has a Grade 3 as well.

7

much lower than that in Denmark, Sweden, and the UK, which register about 2 percent.
Further, the share of the expenditure on disability pension benefits out of total public
expenditure is about 2 percent, which is again much lower than that in other countries.

2-2 Current scheme
Under the current scheme, a person who visited a doctor for the first time for consultation
about the cause of the disability when he/she was under the age of 20 or when he/she was
an NPI pensioner is entitled to receive the Disability Basic Pension benefit. Note that there
is no limitation in terms of age for receiving disability pension benefits, unlike in some
other countries where the recipients of disability pension benefits are converted to
eligibility to receive old age pension benefits after attaining the eligible age (i.e., age 65).
The formula to compute the benefit is as follows.

Grade I = Basic Pension benefit × 1.25 + additional benefit for dependent children.
Grade 2 = Basic Pension benefit + additional benefit for dependent children.

The amount of the Basic Pension benefit is 792,100 yen per year and that of additional
child benefit is 227,000 yen each for the first and second children and 75,900 yen each for
the third and subsequent children.
In addition to the Disability Basic Pension, a person who consulted a doctor to
identify the cause of the disability when he/she was an EPI pensioner is entitled to receive
wage-proportional Disability Employees’ Pension benefit or Disability Mutual Aid Pension
benefit (for the MAI recipients). The formula to compute the benefit of the second tier is as
follows.

8

Grade 1 = Wage proportional benefit × 1.25 + Additional benefit for a spouse.
Grade 2 = Wage proportional benefit + Additional benefit for a spouse.
Grade 3 = Max [Wage proportional benefit, 594,000 yen].

The amount of additional benefit for a spouse is 227,900 yen per year.6
Figure 1 reports the number of the recipients who received the disability pension
benefits between 1970 and 2006.7 The data source is the Annual Report of Social Security
Administration (Shakai Hoken Jigyo Nenpo) published by the Social Security Agency.
Unfortunately, there is no data available by gender or age. The number of recipients was
about 0.5 million in 1970 and increased to 2.0 million in 2006; it expanded four times over
36 years. As seen from the figure, the dominant recipients are the NPI pensioners, who
share about 80 percent of the total. Because most of them are self-employed, their labor
supply is less likely to be associated with the generosity of the disability pension program
and its institutional changes. In contrast, the EPI recipients have occupied less than 20
percent of the total. As discussed below, their labor supply is likely to be affected by
institutional changes in eligibility of the disability pensions but their proportion is relatively
small. Finally, the number of MAI pensioners to receive the disability pension, who are
also likely to be affected by institutional factors, has been very small, 2–3 percent in all
years.8

6

Momose (2008) used the purchasing power parity to compare the amount of benefits in Japan with that in the US and
Sweden. While the amount of benefits of the disability employee pension (Grade 1 or 2) is larger than that in the US and
Sweden, that of the disability basic pension (Grade 1) is much smaller and that for Grade 2 is a half of the standard benefit
in US and Sweden.
7
The fiscal year starts in April and ends in March in Japan. The figures are measured as of the end of the fiscal year.
8
The number of MAI pensioners to receive the disability pension is not available; that of MAI pensioners eligible to
receive the benefits is available in the Annual Report on Social Security Statistics (Shakai Hoken Tokei Nenpo) compiled
by the National Institute of Population and Social Security Research. We compute that the number of MAI pensioners to
receive the disability pension, assuming the proportion of those to receive out of those eligible, both of which are available
in the Annual Report of Social Security Administration, is the same for the EPI and the MAI programs.

9

The impact of past revisions to disability pension programs on DI participation are
illustrated more clearly in Figure 2, which shows the growth rate of disability pension
recipients. We observe three jumps: in 1974–75, 1985–86, and 2005–06. As described in
Section 2-1, the 1974 revision added a Grade 2 level for the NPI Disability Pension
program. The 1985 revision raised the benefit for the NPI pensioners without premium
contributions (i.e., Disability Welfare Pension recipients) to the level for those with
contribution. Finally, the 2006 revision allowed Disability Basic Pension recipients to
receive the EPI benefit as well, if they had made EPI contributions. These jumps, albeit
with limited impact on the total labor force, confirm that the DI participation is affected
more directly by institutional changes than they are by changes in health status.

2-3 Other programs for the disabled
In addition to the disability pension, there are some other programs to assist the disabled.
One is employers’ compensation for employees who were injured, diseased, disabled, or
killed during work-related activities, including a disaster while commuting. Even a firm
employing one employee is required to join the insurance scheme by law at the firm’s cost.
The benefits include compensation for the treatment, labor in absence, and a disabled status
after a treatment as well as benefits for family members if the employee is killed. While the
employers’ compensation covers the mentally disabled, the eligibility is very limited, and
the number of those approved for the mentally disabled benefit, which is relevant to the
rapid increase in the number of the recipients of the disability insurance in Europe, has been
small.9

9
According to The Current Condition of Work Disaster Compensation for Mentally Disabled (Seishin Shougai nado no
Rousai Hoshou Jyokyo) annually released by the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare, the number of the approved was

10

Another program is public assistance. While eligibility does not require a disabling
condition to receive public assistance, the proportion of those who receive public assistance
is larger for the recipients of the disability pension, suggesting that the disability pension
benefits are not sufficient to compensate for the minimum living standards. This is
particularly the case for those with mental disorders, and the share of the disabled to receive
public assistance has increased for the physically disabled and those with mental disorder.10

3. Historical data on health

This section reviews some long-term time series data on representative measures of
health status. First, the trend of mortality in Japan is examined. Second, another measure of
health status, a subjective health status is used to describe the development of health status
in Japan. Third, we will relate the two measures—mortality and subjective health status in
Japan.

3-1 Mortality
Mortality trends are of course not identical with health status, and thus with disability trends,
but are probably the only historical measure available in Japan and that comparable with
other countries. We present the mortality trends in three ways. Figures 3-1 and 3-2
illustrate the ages of equal mortality probability for males and females, respectively. The
very small (9 between 1983 and 1996 (14 years)) but increased to 100 in 2002 and around 270 in 2007 or 2008
(http://www.mhlw.go.jp/bunya/roudoukijun/rousaihoken04/090316.html).
10
Momose (2008) remarked that 250,000 persons received an additional allowance (Shougai Sha Kasan) for the disabled
among the public assistant recipients in 2006 and the number has substantially increased, compared to 100,000 in the
mid-1990s. According to a survey by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government (“Shougai Sha no Seikatsu Jittai”), the
proportion of the recipients of public assistance is 6.4 percent (in 2003 and 7.0 percent in 2008) for the physically disabled,
3.4 percent (in 2003 and 2.7 percent in 2008) for the mentally retarded, and 25.7 percent (in 2003 and 31.0 percent in 2008)
for those with mental disorders, all of which are larger than the average proportion of the public assistance recipients. The
high proportion of the mentally disabled is accounted for by the low employment rate, the high rate of remaining single, and
the high rate of non-recipient of pension benefit.

11

historical data on mortality by age and gender in every year from 1960 to 2007 is available
in “Simplified Life Table (Kan-I Seimei Hyo).”11 We set the mortality at age 60 and 65 in
1960 as the reference points in the base year and computed the corresponding figures in the
subsequent years, assuming the mortality increases linearly with the ages. As seen in Figure
3-1, for males, the mortality at age 60 in 1960 corresponds to that at age 71.1 in 2007 (11.1
years extension), and the mortality at age 65 in 1960 does so to that at age 75.6 in 2007
(10.6 years extension). Those results show that the mortality in Japan drastically declined
over 50 years. Figure 3-2 reveals that the extension is more remarkable for females. The
mortality at age 60 in 1960 corresponds to that at age 74.0 in 2007 (14.0 years extension),
and the mortality at age 65 in 1960 does so to that at age 78.1 in 2007 (13.1 years
extension). On a closer look, it can be observed that the tempo of extension for males has
accelerated in the 1970s and has become slightly stagnant in the 1990s. A similar pattern is
observed for females too, but the weak trend in the 1990s is less evident.
Figure 4 presents the mortality trends in a different manner. It shows the two-year
mortality rates by age and gender in 1960 and 2005. If we take the 5 percent level of
morality, the corresponding age for males in 1960 and 2005 was 68.7 and 78.9, respectively,
while that for females in 1960 and 2005 was 72.5 and 84.0, respectively. The gap in the two
years is larger for males probably because the starting age in the initial year is lower than
that for females. This figure also demonstrates that the mortality rate has substantially
declined over 45 years.
Figures 5-1 and 5-2 report the mortality rates at ages 55, 60, and 65 in every year for
males and females, respectively. This again shows that the mortality rate has declined over
half a century. The mortality has been monotonically declining and has always been lower
11

Unfortunately, data is available only for every five year since 1995. We interpolated a linear trend for the 5 years to
obtain the data in every year.

12

for females than it has been for males. As observed in Figure 4, the decline in the male
mortality rate is greater in the 1970s but slower in the 1990s, while that for the female
mortality rate is linear.

3-2 Self-rated health
Next, we move on to discussing other health measures. A representative measure of health
status is a self-rated health status, which has been widely used to stand for the state of
progress of the condition. While there are some critiques for the measure because of its
subjective nature, it is accepted as a popular aggregate health measure that is easily
obtained at a low cost. A standard version of self-reported health status is the North
American version with five answer categories ranging from “excellent” to “poor.” Another
is the European version with five answer categories ranging from “very good” to “very
poor.” The North American version is more popular and employed in some large data sets
in Japan, including the Comprehensive Survey of Living Conditions of People (CPSLCP)
compiled by the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare starting in 1986 and JSTAR
(Japanese Study of Ageing and Retirement), which is internationally comparable to
HRS/ELSA/SHARE (Ichimura, Hashimoto, and Shimizutani, 2009), starting in 2007. We
utilize the data of self-rated health on a five-point scale from the CPSLCP—“excellent,”
“very good,” “good,” “fair,” and “poor.”
Figures 6-1 and 6-2 illustrate the developments of the self-rated health status in
males and females, respectively—the shares of those assessing their heath conditions
“excellent” or “very good and those assessing them as “very good” or “good”—as well as
the shares of respondents reporting subjective symptoms and of those who visit a
hospital/clinic among those aged 55–64 (per thousand persons), along with the mortality

13

rate for the same age group over the period between 1986 and 2007. The CPSLCP began in
1986 and is performed every three years. While the morality rate has been steadily
declining, the share of those reporting good health increased up to the middle of the 1990s,
although it has displayed a declining trend to date. With no clear trend observed from the
other two health measures, it suggests that there is a negligible relationship between the
health measure and the decline in mortality.

3-3 LFP and DI versus mortality
This section examines the relationship between LFP and DI in comparison to mortality. To
this end, we first collected data of the number of DI recipients by age group and gender
from the Review of Public Pension Finances (Zaisei Saikeisan), which the Ministry of
Health, Labour, and Welfare releases almost every five years. Next, we linearly
interpolated the figures for other years with some adjustment.12 Figures 7-1 and 7-2 show
the trends of employment and disability along with the mortality rate for those aged 60–64
for males and females, respectively. While the mortality rate has been declining steadily,
the trend of the employment rate has been slightly downward for males and almost flat for
females, with some cyclical movements for both. More importantly, the share of DI
recipients has remained very low for both males and females, albeit with a slight upward
trend, and had no clear co-movements with the employment rate and the mortality rate.

12
In the Review of Public Pension Finances, the number of recipients by age and gender for EPI pensions is available in
1979, 1983, and 1986 and that of the eligible is in 1991, 1996, 2001 and 2007. We use the shares of the recipients (or the
eligible) by gender and age group (multiplied by the total number available in the Annual Report on Social Security
Administration) to estimate the number of the recipients in those years. We assume that the shares for MAI pensioners are
identical with those of EPI pensioners. The number of recipients of NPI pensioners under the old program before 1985 is
available in 1978, 1981, 1986, 1991, 1996, 2001, and 2007 and those under the new program after 1985 in 1986, 1991,
1996, 2001 and 2007 (the number of the eligible instead of the number of recipients since 1991 for both). We applied the
same method to compute the number of recipients in those years. After those computations, we performed linear
interpolation.

14

Figures 8-1 and 8-2 show the relationships between the employment rate and age
and between the employment rate and mortality risk for males, where mortality risk is
one-year mortality rate at a given age. The employment rate by age declined slightly from
1980 to 2005 but that by mortality risk declined more substantially. More specifically, the
employment rate was 50 percent at an approximate age of 70 in 1980 and at an approximate
age of 66 in 2005, while it was 50 percent at the mortality rate of about 3.5 percent in 1980
and only about 1.4 percent in 2005. Although the mortality rate declined substantially over
the past 25 years, the elderly have become more inclined to retire. See Figures 9-1 and 9-2
for females. The employment rate by age shifted upward up to age 60 and remained almost
unchanged beyond that between 1980 and 2005. The mortality-employment curves skewed
to the vertical axis, and the level of the mortality rate that corresponds to a 50 percent
employment rate stayed approximately 0.5 percent over the same period.

4. Historical data on activity and program participation rates

This section explores the historical relationship between labor force participation and
disability pension programs.13 The goal is to assess the effect of each revision in the
disability pension program on the labor market by discovering trends that may be explained
by the revisions.

4.1 Historical labor force data

employment, unemployment, and not being in the labor force for three age groups: 40–44,
50–54, and 60–64 over 1970–2010 for males and females. For males, the employment rate
shows cyclical movements with a slightly downward trend for those aged 60–64, while it
has remained stable at a high level for the younger two age groups. Correspondingly, the
oldest age group shows clearer cyclicality of the rates of those unemployed and of those not
in the labor force as compared to the other age groups. For females, the rates of those
employed and of those not in the labor force show a modest uptrend and downtrend,
respectively, for the two younger age groups, while they are stable for those aged 60–64.
The unemployment rate has been moving almost the same way across age groups.

4.2 Historical DI data
Figures 13-1 and 13-2 present long-term trends of the shares of DI beneficiaries in total
population for three age groups: 40–45, 50–54, and 60–64 for males and females,
respectively, between 1970 and 2010. The figures also indicate the three major revisions in
1974, 1986, and 2006. We observe that the share of DI recipients has been modestly
increasing for all the age groups in both males and females, though the share remains low.
For males, the share is 1–2 percent for those aged 40–45, whereas that for those aged 50–54
and 60–64 increased from 1–2 percent in 1970 to 3-4 percent in 2010.
Taking a closer look, we see that there are small jumps in 1974–75, 1985–86, and
2005–06—albeit not for all age groups—consistent with Figure 2. All of them are caused
by the revisions to disability pension programs. In particular, for both males and females
aged 60–64, we observe a remarkable increase in the DI beneficiaries following the 1975
revision and the jump in 2006. In 1974, the disability welfare program began to cover
Grade 2 as well, and many patients with mental disorders or deficiencies became eligible to
receive the benefit. The 2006 revision allowed Disability Basic Pension recipients aged 65

16

or above to additionally receive EPI benefits, providing the elderly with more incentives to
apply for Disability Basic Pension. However, these trends in the DI participation rates are
unrelated to those in the unemployment rates in all age groups (see Figures 11-1 and 11-2),
suggesting that there is no trade-off between DI and unemployment benefit receipts.

4.3 Historical data on DI participation versus mortality and health
Next, we try to relate the DI participation and health measures. Figures 14 and 15 present
long-term trends in mortality at age 45 and 60 and DI participation rates at ages 40–44 and
60–64 for males and females. It is clear that there is no reasonable relation between the two
series in each figure. Instead, we observe a contradicting pattern: the DI participation rate
has increased despite the lower mortality implying that people have become healthier.
Figures 14–15 show that there are two small bumps in the DI participation rate after the
1974, 1985, and 2006 revisions, which are evident for males aged 50–54 and 60–64. In
contrast, there is no jump in the mortality rate in the same period, reinforcing the idea that
the small increases in the DI participation rate were motivated by the DI program revisions.
This justifies the observations that there is no discontinuity in the DI participation rate after
some disturbances in the mortality rates in the second half of the 1990s and the beginning
of the 2000s, which is the case for both males and females.
Figures 16–18 illustrate long-term trends of self-rated health status at age 55–64 and
DI participation rates at age 60–64 for males and females, respectively. Figure 16 shows
that there is little correspondence between DI participation and the shares of those who
reported their health was “excellent” or “very good” and those who reported it as “fair” or
“good.” The share of the latter group increased until the mid 1990s but declined from the
end of the 1990s, while the share of the former remained virtually the same. However, the
DI participation rate showed an uptrend. This is the case for both males and females.

17

Figure 17 also shows little association between DI participation and the share of
those who reported bad health (“poor” or “very poor”), which is again the case for both
males and females. The share of people suffering from bad health declined until the mid
1990s but increased slightly from the end of the 1990s, while the DI participation rates
continued to increase.
Figure 18 computed a score of self-rated health status, which assigns “five” to the
best of the five choices and “one” to the worst. Again, there is no clear relationship between
DI participation and the score of self-perceived health status. These figures show that the
trend of DI participation is unrelated with self-rated health status, the same as for the
relationship between DI participation and mortality, although we need to be careful in
interpreting the comparison of self-rated health status across individuals and time.

5. Concluding remarks

This paper investigates historical information to explore the relationship between
labor force participation of middle aged and old people and the disability program in Japan.
In particular, we explore the time series dimension to identify what has determined the
trend in disability program participation over time and relate it with the labor supply.
We find that the mortality and other health measures have been largely unrelated with
the disability program participation rates. While major revisions of the disability program
have slightly expanded the eligibility for the DI program, the program participation is still
very low; thus, the effect on labor force participation is very limited in Japan, in contrast to
some European countries with a high take up rate inducing early retirement.
