    "abstract": "\n\nWorker shortages are common in many industries. This paper examines the effect of government subsidies to address these shortages in the context of a reform that tied Medicaid payments to nursing home staffing levels. We find that the reform substantially increased staffing, especially for facilities serving many Medicaid patients. Facilities responded primarily by hiring workers in lower-wage roles rather than increasing hours of incumbent or high-wage staff. This contrasts with null effects we estimate for a non-incentivized rate increase, suggesting that the incentive structure of government payments\u2014rather than just the level\u2014is key to boosting employment in sectors facing worker shortages.\n\n",

I received payments exceeding $10,000 from the NIA IMPACT Collaboration through Brown University for research related to nursing homes. I also received research funding exceeding $10,000 within the last three years from the National Institute on Aging. I also have received internal funding in excess of $10,000 from internal UCLA grants. To my knowledge, these organizations do not have any interests in the findings of this research. Moreover, they do not have any right to review the manuscript. In 2023, the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services paid me $3,500 to participate as one of multiple academics advising on a proposed grant application for healthcare workforce collaboratives. This grant program was unrelated the paper.\n\n\n"
