The Tax Reform Act of 1986 and Economic Growth

Both economic and productivity growth declined sharply in the 19705.

growth depends on changes in both the capital/output ratio and the level of
work effort, variables that can be affected by tax policy.

small that actual gains will be swamped by the direct effect of a smaller

My analysis is divided into three basic parts and a conclusion.

The

basic parts discuss the likely impact of the 1986 Tax Act on work effort,
saving, and the quantity and quality of business investment.

I begin each pert

with an analysis of potential gains from tax changes and then examine the 1986
Tax Act.2

The conclusion summarizes the earlier analyses and briefly discusses

future policies to stimulate economic growth.

I.

Tax Reform and Labor Supply

One touted benefit of tax reform is greater work effort in response to a
reduction in marginal tax rates on labor income.

While economists disagree on

many issues, there is substantial consensus that labor supply, especially that

of secondary workers, is highly responsive to increases in the return from
work.

Because greater labor supply expands national income, many advocated tax

reform on this basis.

A.

Potential Gains

A revenue-neutral, distributionally—neutral
tax rates on labor income in just three ways:

tax reform can lower marginal

by broadening the tax base, by

shifting thestatutory tax burden from households to businesses, or by reducing
the effective progressivity of the tax burden.

However, an increase in labor

supply is likely only if the tax rate reductions are achieved by reducing the
system's effective progressivity because only in this case will most workers be
able to purchase more goods for an extra hour of work (Browning and Browning,
1985, and Slemrod, 1987) .

In

the other two cases, the price of some goods, as

well as the after-tax wage rate, will rise, making an increase in the real
return from work uncertain.

—3.-

Base broadening consists of either taxing previously untaxed sources of
income or disallowing existing deductions.

If the previously untaxed sources

are labor income, including them in the tax base and using the revenues to
lower statutory tax rates doesn't lower effective marginal tax rates and won't
increase labor supply.

A change from a 50 percent tax rate applied to 50

percent of income to a 25 percent rate applied to all income reduces the
incentive to take income in the previously nontaxed form but shouldn't affect
labor supply.

In either case, 25 percent of a marginal dollar of income goes

to the Treasury and 75 percent is retained by the worker.
Disallowing existing deductions or taxing previously untaxed capital
income and using the funds to lower tax rates also probably doesn't increase
labor supply.

The incentive to work depends on the amount of goods one can

purchase with an additional nour of work, not just the after-tax wage rate.
While a cut in marginal tax rates increases after-tax income from the hour of
work (and thus the reward in terms of goods not included in the base
broadening)

,

disallowing

deductions

increases the 'after-tax" prices of goods

that were previously tax—favored, reducing the reward for work in terms of
these goods.

Thus the quantity of goods one can purchase with the greater

after-tax wage does not necessarily increase, and no increase in hours worked
should be expected.

To see this point more clearly, consider some specific deductions.
largest is that for home mortgage interest.

The

The revenue raised from

disallowing this deduction would allow a significant reduction in marginal tax
rates and thus would increase the after—tax wage.

But the annual coat of

financing housing would rise from the after—tax mortgage rate, say three—
quarters of 10 percent, to the full before—tax rate, 10 percent in our example.

—4—

Would people work herder in response to an increase in their after-tax marginal
wage rete, even though the cost of a major component of their consumption has
increased even more sharply?

Probably not.

What about the deductibility of state and local income, sales or property
taxes?

First of all, loss of the state and local income tax deduction would

not necessarily permit lower marginal total tsx rates when federal, state and
local tsxes are considered.

For example, a 30 percent federal rate along with

a fully deductible 5 percent state rate gives a 33.5 percent total rate.
Removing the deductibility and lowering the federal rate to 28.5 would leave
the total rate unchanged.

Second, while loss of the sales tax deduction would

allow a reduction in marginal tax rates, for itemizers it would also raise the
effective price of goods subject to the tax (and for nonitemizers
raise any revenue) .

Third,

it wouldn't

loss of the property tax deduction would raise the

effective price of municipally—provided

services that property taxes finance.

Because the prices of some goods and services rise, even a higher marginal
after-tax wage rate need not trigger greater work effort.
But what if lower household tax rates are achieved by shifting the tax
burden to business?

This doesn't change the argument because business taxes

are ultimately paid by households, either as lower wages

In either case, greater labor supply would not be likely to follow;

a higher price would tend to offset the positive incentive of a higher aftertax marginal wage rate on work effort.

—5—

Browning and Browning

(1985)

make the case with a simple example.

If the

tax liability under both old and new law is $3,000 on an income of $30,000 and
$5,000 on an income of $40,000 (the tax change is distributionally neutral)

then the effective marginal tax rate applied when income rises from $30,000 to
$40,000 is 20 percent for both laws.

And work effort will likely be the same

even if one law has low marginal rates applied to a broad base and the other
has higher rates applied to a narrower base.

B.

Slemrod (1987)

The 1986 Tax Act

suggests two means by which the distribution of tax

burdens within income clssses could be altered so as to increase labor supply
within the context of a revenue neutral reform
standard deduction and in the personal exemption.

reductions in the minimum
Both would increase marginal

tax rates (from zero to the lowest marginal rate) for a subset of taxpayers who
paid no taxes prior to the reductions but now would pay taxes.

The revenue

pick-up from these taxpayers would allow the marginal tax rates of all others

to be cut.

The positive labor response of the latter group should roughly

offset the negative response of the former group.

In addition, though, the

reduction in standard deduction and/or personal exemptions of those who
previously paid taxes would allow a further reduction in their marginal tax
rates, and this should then lead to an increase in total labor supply.
Lowering the personal exemption has another advantage.

Because the

number of personal exemptions per tsx return rises with income, marginal tax
rates could be reduced without changing the distribution of the tax burden by
income class.

The 1986 Tax Act will not provide labor supply incentives through either
of these channels.

In fact, the 1986 Act went in the opposite direction,

raising the standard deduction and personal exemption in order to increase
fairness.

Moreover, partly because of these changes the Tax Act is likely not

—6—

distributionally neutral.

In fact, if the increased corporate taxes era

assumed to fall entirely on capital income recipients, then the tax burden is
noticeably ahifted from those earning under $tO,000 to those earning over

views on this issue and then turn to

the specifics of the 1986 Tax Act as it affects first personal saving and then

Assuming the Tax Act is revenue neutral, changes

change in total saving determines

After-Tax Returns and Personal Saving

Most economists believe personal saving to be relatively insensitive to
net returns to saving.

While economists have constructed models in which

vehicles, with widely varying taxation and risk, how this return should be

Because of the measurement problems, many economists look directly to
historic periods where net rates of return clearly changed for evidence on the

.

Moreover, real pretax interest

Thus many point to the post-1981 period as one where the

saving rate should have risen noticeably if saving is interest sensitive.
However, the officially reported personal saving rate has plummeted from 7.3
percent of income in 1980-81 to about 4.4 percent in 1985-86, a decline of 40
percent.

conclude

—8—

This conclusion rests on two premises;

the official savings rate is a

reasonable measure of household saving and other forces were not deterring
saving in the lgBQ5.
(1988)

Both presumptions are incorrect,

Hendershott and Peek

have examined the official computation of this saving rate and found it

lacking for three reasons:
consumption,

(1) purchases

(2) contributions

of durable goods are treated as pure

to government retirement plans are counted as

government, not household, saving, and (3) the inflation-generated

premium in

interest rates, which simply compensates for expected capital losses on fixed—
dollar financial assets, is included in household income.

When Nenderahott and

Peek recompute the personal saving rate in the 1980s, it is flat, not plunging.
Moreover, the rise in the stock market between the summer of 1982 and the
end of 1986 added over a trillion dollars to household wealth.

Such an

increase would be expected to reduce saving out of current income.

The

constancy of the personal saving rate, correctly measured, in the face of this

wealth increase, suggests a positive response to the net return on saving.

The

1981 expansion in retirement saving incentives may have stimulated household
saving in spite of the observed decline in the official aaving rate.

B.

The 1986 Tax Act and Personal Saving

Numerous provisions

in the 1986 Tax Act affect the return to saving.

These include changes in tax rates on dividends, interest and capital gains,
changes in the taxation of tax shelter activities, and changes in the
deductibility of IRA and 40l)k) retirement contributions.

I first discuss the

tax rate changes and attacks on tax shelters and then turn to the changed
deductibility of retirement saving.
Table 1 contains marginal tax rates (federal plus net state and local)
under both 1965 tax law and the Tax Act of 1986 for homeowners

incomes in 1988 and different household status.

incomes are for

The after—tax

households if they rented; if they owned they would have lower tax liabilities.

-9—

The marginal tax rates are for owners and reflect substantial housing-related
deductions; for renters the marginal rates would be higher.

As can be seen,

tax rates on marginal dividend and/or interest income are cut by

5

to 15

percentage points for married owners with incomes between $35,000 and $45,000
and above $65,000.

For household heads and singles, respectively, such cuts

occur for incomes above $50,000.

This represents about 25 percent of married

couples but only 10 percent of single and other household heads.
declines tend to raise the after-tax return to savers.

Such rate

On the other hand, the

statutory capital gains tax rate is increased by 8 to 15 percentage points for
these same households.

Also acting to lower returns to savers are the anti—tax shelter
provisions of the new law.

For many years, different sources of income have

been taxed differently under the federal tax code.

For example, until 1981

"unearned" (nonlabor( income was subject to a far higher maximum tax rate than
was

earned' or labor income.

Also, capital gains have generally been taxed

less heavily than other income, owing both to the gains exclusion and deferral
until realization.

Moreover, portfolio capital losses, while fully deductible

against portfolio capital gains, have been deductible against only $3,000 of
other income.
The 1986 Act introduces a new income class, passive income, with
restrictions somewhat analogous to those on portfolio capital losses.

Passive

income is defined to include income generated from business and trade
activities in which the taxpayer does not materially participate and from
rental activities such as real estate.

For individuals, partnerships, trusts,

and personal service corporations, losses from passive activities can be used

to offset income from other passive activities, but not other income (e.g.,
wages, interest, etc.(.

Losses that cannot be claimed in a particular

year can

be "banked" and uaed to offset passive income in foture years.3

Also,

cumulative losses are deductible in full at the time of sale of the property,
icrespective of whether a gain or less is recognized.
The 1986 Act also strengthened the minimum tax considerably.

and 150 percent declining balance)

,

bonds, and the appreciation component of charitable contributions.

These

expansions will increase the likelihood of taxpayers paying the minimum tax.

On net, the anti-shelter provisions and increase in capital gains
taxation would appear to more than offset the decline in marginal tax rates on
interest and dividends.

The declines are significant for only the fifth of

households with the highest incomes, and these households are just those most
likely to have been using tax shelters and paying capital gains.

The net

return to saving is probably decreased.
The 1986 Act also reduces the tax

advantages of retirement saving.

IRA

contributions for those with established pensions will no longer be deductible
for households with incomes above $35,000 (singles)

or $50,000 (married

couples, and they will be only partially deductible for singles with incomes
between $25,000 and $35,000 and marrieds with incomes between $40,000 and

$50,OO0. Also, the maximum deductible annual contributions to supplemental

—11—

retirement accounts [40l(k)s) has been lowered from $30,000 to $7,000.

These

changes certainly reduce the net return to savers, but many contend the
reduction affects few on the margin.

For high savers, IRA contributions are

not the marginal dollars saved because the contributions are limited to $2000 a
year.

Moreover, previous saving can be transferred from taxable accounts to

tax-exempt accounts.6

Thus the surge in retirement contributions in the early

1980s (roughly $40 billion to IRAa and $20 billion to 401(k)s in 1985 alone)
may not have reflected an incentive-induced increase in saving, and removing
these tax incentives may not reduce aaving.
While these observations are relevant, a significant part of these
contributions baa likely affected behavior at the margin.

Nearly 40 percent of

IRA contributors made contributions below the maximum amount, and half of
401(k) contributions may have been by individuals contributing over the $7,000
limit (Nauaman and Potarba, 1986)

.

For these households, the reduced

deductibility limits will lower the marginal return to saving.
Overall the marginal return to saving will decline.

In the absence of

C.

The 1986 Tax Act and Corporate and Foreign Saving

The effects on corporate and foreign saving are
likely to be even more
important than those on personal saving.

The 1986 Act substantially increases

the tax burden on corporations while lowering it on households.
1987—92 period, the shift is $120 billion.

Over the

This will certainly lower corporate

—12-

saving, at laast until pretax corporate returna rise to offset the impact on
after-tax earnings.

The issue is whether household saving will rise to offset

the decline in corporate saving.
If the greater cofporate taxation were on existing capital, then we would
expect stock prices to decline and thus household wealth to fall.
households would increase their saving.

In response,

This increase, plus the normal saving

owing to the $120 billion increase in disposable income, would likely offset
the decrease in corporate saving.

However, under the 1986 Tax Act existing

capital is taxed more favorably; Summers (1987)

estimates that taxes on old

capital will be $70 billion less in bhe 1987—91 period, while taxes on new
capital will be $190 billion more.

With old capital less heavily taxed, stock

prices will rise, not fall, and household saving should be depressed as a
result

An alternative analysis of the impact of the increase in corporate
taxation on household saving asks whether households

"pierce the corporate

veil" without specifying the process through which this piercing occurs.

However, both

the measurement errors are negatively correlated because households are net
creditors and corporations are net debtors.

(and augmented by other adjustments) and corporate saving is raised by the
corporate inflation premium, the coefficient of adjusted corporate saving

US.

As a result, foreign

saving will decrease, the decline in interest rates will be dampened, and the
U.S. capital stock will grow less rapidly.

Kruqman

(1985)

suggests that half

of the potential rate decline would be offset by reduced foreign saving, and

Summers

(1985)

analysis is consistent with this.

III.

Investment

Probably the most widely—cited economic benefit of tax reform is the
efficiency gain from a better allocation of capital.

The double taxation of

corporate capital, the zero (or low) taxation of owner-occupied housing and
state and local capital, the investment-credit bias in favor of equipment over
structures, all lead to misallocations.

A more efficient capital stock would

be a more productive capital stock.

A.

Potential Benefits

A major conclusion of the extensive research in recent years on
efficiency is that the potential gains from a more efficient allocation of
capital are not nearly as large as once thought.

More specifically, the

potential gains are probably less than one percent of GNP (Fullerton and
Henderson, 1988) .

A simple

example

will

illustrate

why the

gains

are so small.

Say that the economy has equal amounts of two types of capital with equal
depreciation rates earning gross returns of 11 percent at the margin in one
case and 9 percent in the other owing to a tax preference.

A productivity gain

—14-

can be achieved by equating returns in the two uses.

Assuming Cobb-Douglas

technology, roughly one-tenth of the currently tax-preferred capital earning
between 9 and 10 percent would be shifted into the currently tax-diacriminated
capital.

The shift is one-tenth because the marginal groaa return is changing

by one-tenth-

The return on the shifted capital would rise from the g to 10

percent range to the 10 to 11 percent range.

That is, the one—tenth of the

capital stock reallocated would earn an additional percentage point.

Thus, the

initial 2 percentage point tax wedge reduced the average rate of return on the
capital stock by only a tenth of a percentage point.

With an average rate of

return on capital of 10 percent and an output/capital

ratio below unity, the

output gain is less than one percent.
This is not an unrealistic example.

While net returns on apecific types

of capital under old tax law may have differed by as much as four percentage
points (as shown in Table 2( ,

the

average net returns on the higher-earning

half of the capital stock was less than two percentage points more than that on
the lower-earning half.

A second source of productivity enhancement is an increase in the rate of
business investment owing to either greeter total investment or a reallocation

of a given investment level from housing to business outlays.
potential

Here, the

output gains are more substantial.

Summers

(1981b)

provides some illustrative computations again assuming

Cobb-Douglas technology.

With exogenous technological growth, an increase in

the share of output devoted to net business investment would temporarily raise
the rate of productivity growth as the economy moves to a higher output level.
Eventually, though, a new output/capital ratio will be achieved, and the rate

of growth of output and capital will return to the long-run rate given by the
growth rates of labor supply and technology.
business-investment

With a one—third increase in the

share of output, the productivity growth rate increases by

—15—
only 0.1 percent per year in the first decade and lesser amounts thereafter.
The long—run output path, however, is 7½ percent higher.8

If instead

technological progress is embodied in capital goods, the same increase in
investment has a larger short—run impact because it accelerates the
introduction of new technology.

The increase in the productivity growth rate

is nearly 0.2 percent per year during the first decade.

However, the long-run

output path is not any higher; the economy just gets there quicker

(Phelps,

1962)
This output gain is not free.

If an increase in saving is the source of

the greater business investment, then consumption is reduced during the
transition to the new equilibrium.

If reduced housing investment is the

source, then the consumption-of-housing-services

path is lower forever.

1986 Tax Act

The Tax Reform Act of 1986 has negative direct implications for virtually
every type of capital good.

Longer depreciation lives raise the investment

housing, the elimination of investment tax credits increases hurdle rates for
equipment and public utility structures, the decrease in the corporate tax rate

The magnitude of the decline depends on the interest

sensitivities of both the supply of domestic and foreign saving and of
investment demand itself.

Hendershott

(1987)

constructed a model in which

total saving is independent of rates of return and the demands for capital are
approximately unitary elastic with respect to the rental prices of capital
goods.

In this model, interest rates have to decline by well over a percentage

Of course, interest rates will decline less if the supply of ssving is
reduced, and a reduction should be anticipated.

As discussed above, a decline

in private saving should be expected owing to the reduction in retirement
saving incentives and the shift of the tax burden from low saving households to
higher saving corporations.

Moreover, a tendency toward lower interest rates

will be mitigsted by decreased foreign saving.

Table 2 contains estimates of the changes in investment incentives
contained in the 1986 Tax Act.

The first column reports net (of depreciation)

pretax required annual returns (investment hurdle rates) for a variety of
corporate and noncorporate investments under 1985 law.

The next two pairs of

columns report estimated changes in these returns under two assumptions
regarding tax—induced changes in interest rates, a percentage point decline and
no change (the appendix contains the specifics of these calculations).

As can

be seen, under 1985 tax law the especially tax-favored assets were owner—
occupied housing of high-income households, equipment, and intangible capital;
the especially tax-disadvantaged assets were corporate inventories and
industrial structures.

The investment tax credit gave equipment its advantage,

the expensing of advertising and R&D outlays accounts for the intangible
advantage, and the nontaxation of owner housing returns explains that large
advantage for high tax bracket households.

Corporate

investments are generally

at both the business

(personal) levels.

The 1986 Tax Act is effective in reducing disparities among hurdle rates
within each broad sector.

In every case, the hurdle rate of the previously

most tax—favored asset rises the most (equipment and owner housing of high—
income households) and that of the least tax-favored asset falls or rises the
least (inventories and owner housing of low-income households)

.

In

fact, the

investment hurdle rates for business capital under the 1986 Act are remarkably

terms of sectors.

In contrast, the Tax Act is perverse in

Hurdle rates for the most heavily taxed corporate sector are

increased the most, while those for the least heavily taxed sector, owner—

—18—

occupied housing, deccesse or incresse the lesst.

According to my

calculations, the losses from less equal trestment of sectors exceed the gsins

from more equal trestment of assets.
Fullerton, Henderson and Mackie
Fullerton, Henderson and Hackie (1987)

have made comparable calculations

using a far more detailed general equilibrium model.

The model contains 15

consumer goods produced by 18 producers goods which, in turn, have labor and 38
types of both corporate and noncorporste capital as imputs.

The 38 capital

goods include 20 types of equipment, 5 utility structures, 10 other structures,
inventories, and 2 types of land.

In contrast, all owner housing

is presumed

to be held by a single, aversge tax-bracket household.
The Fullerton-Henderson-Mackie
similar to my simple model.

(FilM)

model gives results remarkedly

Their average changes in hurdle rates for the

investment aggregates under two model specifications for corporations are
listed in column 4 of Tsble 2.

The chsnges are generally in between those in

columns 2 and 3, which is just as expected because their calculations presume a
30 basis point decline in interest rates.

The

FilM

model simulation actually computes a 60 basis point interest rate

decline to maintain the aggregate demand for capital.

Host of the difference

between this and my larger estimated decline stems from their ihclusion of
land.

Land constitutes 60 percent of noncorporate capital and 30 percent of

all capital.

Because land is not taxed more heavily under the 1986 Tax Act,

including land in the model as an elastically supplied good greatly dampens the
interest rate decline needed to maintain the aggregate demand for capital.

The inclusion of land is also important to
efficiency results.

and

With no saving response, corporate capital decreases by 8

percent, noncorporate—nonhousing
rises by 2 percent.

FilM's capital stock

capital increases by 7 percent, and housing

Honcorporate capital rises because most land is in this

—19—

sector and the demand for land rises absolutely when interest rates decline.

With land excluded, corporate and noncorporate-nonhousing capital decrease by
10 percent and 2 percent, respectively, giving a decline in total business
capital of 8 percent.
If one views nonland business capital as the key total capital variable
because one does not accept the assumption that land is as easily produced as
plant and equipment (or because new technology is not embodied in land)
the Tax Act has a significantly negative effect.

,

then

The decline in business

capital, and thus the negative impact of the Tax Act, will be magnified by the
anticipated decreases in private and foreign saving.
Fullerton, Henderson and Mackie find that the efficiency gains from
better asset allocation within sectors outweigh the greater losses from poorer
sectoral allocaticn)°

One might expect the far more detailed asset treatment

to lead to such a result if different classes of equipment or of structures
were taxed far more differently under old law than new.

In fact, though,

different classes were not taxed all that differently under old law and do not

seem to be taxed more evenly under the 1986 Tax Act (compare the differences in
effective tax rates in FHM, Table 3)

.

The greater FHM gains come from the

inclusion of land which, with inventories, was the heaviest taxed asset under
old law and is about averaged—taxed under the new 1986

Act1

Galper, Lucke and Toder
Galper, Lucke and Toder

(GLT)

take an approach nearly opposite to FHM.

GLT emphasize financial behavior, risk taking, and taxation at the personal,
rather than, business level.

All housing is assumed to be owner-occupied,

and

it and consumer durables are held by 400 different households, differentiated
by income, wealth, marital and itemization status.

In contrast only, single,

conglomerated corporate and noncorporate business capital stocks, rather than

38 classes, are analyzed.

—20—

The GOT model computes a percentage point decline in interest rates to
maintain the aggregate demand for capital.

The major capital stock changes are

a 12 percent decrease in state and local government capital and a roughly
offsetting, in dollar amounts, 6 percent increase in consumer durables,

two

assets not included in the FHM model.

Corporate and noncorporate capital each

decline by a single percentage point.

These declines could rise to as much as

5 percent when a decline in private saving and an endogenous fall in foreign
saving in response to the decline in interest rates is incorporated.
Summary
All three models suggest five to ten percent declines in business
investment.

A ten percent decline, lowering the share of net business

investment in net output from 0.045 to 0.04, would, from the growth
calculations discussed earlier, lower the long—run output path by three
percent.

IV.

Conclusion

The Tax Reform Act of 1986 will lower the share of net output channeled
into net investment and will tilt net investment from industrial to other uses.
Both effects will reduce the long-run output path.

On the other hand, the

industrial investment made will be marginally more efficient.
will be largely unaffected.

Labor supply

On net, the long—run output path will be reduced

by two to four percent, and productivity growth will slow until this lower path
is reached.

That legislation shifting the tax burden from labor and existing

capital to new investment would have this result should hardly come as a
surprise.
Let me expand briefly on these conclusions.
is generally taxed at a lower rate.

Interest and dividend income

On the other hand, capital gains are taxed

more heavily, tax shelters are restricted (new passive loss rules and a more
inclusive minimum income tax base( , and deductible contributions to retirement

and ensure that it is channelled into industrial capital?

Within the given constraints, a growth policy would be the following.
First, additional

tax revenues would be raised, either by increaaing all tax

rates a faw points or introducing a new consumption

tax)3

Second, part of

the revenues would be earmarked to reduce the federal deficit (increase

national saving) and part would be used to reintroduce business investment
incentives to ensure that most of the increased national saving flows into

business investment, rather than being offset by a decline in foreign saving
or being diverted into other capital.

Much of the rate decline should have occurred prior to enactment of the Tax
Act.

All tax reform plans considered in 1986 proposed elimination of the

investment tax credit for equipment and public utility structures retroactive
to ths beginning of 1986, and the likelihood of some version of tax reform
passing was high virtually all year.

Thus the decline in interest rates and

the weakness in equipment expenditures experienced in 1986 was partially
attributable to the anticipeted removal of this provision.

Indeed, half of

model—calculated decline in interest rates is due solely to the elimination of
this credit.

does not reflect the negative impact of the vsrious accounting and specific
industry rule changes on investment demand.

Inclusion of tangible capital and

incorporation of these other impacts could easily reverse the FilM results.

It is worth noting thst both the

the difference is importent only when an undue emphasis is placed on the sign

nonconporate real estate because the required equity rate is higher owing to
the double taxation of dividends.

For nuncorporate structures I assume a real

after-tax interest rate of 0.0275 both before and after tax reform )the cut in
tax rates tends to raise r but a decline in pretax interest rates lowers
real rate of 0.0375 is assumed for corporate investments.

As it turns out, trading was advantageous under 1985 law but will not be under
the Tax Reform Act of 1986.

In this analysis, we assume that the marginal tax rate of the marginal
investor was 0.45 (including state and local income taxes) under old law and
0.36 under new.

The 0.0275 real rate and 0.045 expected inflation rate are

consistent with a 0.09 percent risk—free interest rate and a 0.023 percent risk
premium under old law and a 0.08 percent risk-free rate under new law.
