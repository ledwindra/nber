    "abstract": "\n\nWe show that supply networks are inefficiently, and insufficiently, resilient. Upstream firms can adjust capacity investments to hedge against supply and demand shocks. However, the social benefits of such investments are not internalized, because of market incompleteness and market power. Upstream firms underinvest in resilience, passing on the costs to downstream firms, and drive trade excessively toward the spot markets. Policies designed to incentivize capacity investment, reduce reliance on spot markets, and enhance competition ameliorate the externality.\n\n",
