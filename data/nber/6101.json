    "abstract": "\n\nCountries differ greatly in R&D spending, and these differences are particularly striking when comparing developed with developing countries.  The paper examines the extent to which the benefits of R&D are concentrated in the investing countries.  It is argued that significant benefits spill over to other countries in the world.  The argument is supported by quantitative estimates of such cross-country effects.\n\n",
