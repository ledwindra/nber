THE EFFECT OF ILLICIT DRUG USE
ON THE WAGES OF YOUNG ADULTS

ABSTRACT

This paper examines the effects of cocaine and marijuana use
on the wages of a sample of young adults drawn from the NLS Youth

Cohort. The endogeneity of drug use in a wage equation is
considered and a 2SLS procedure is implemented. The rather
surprising results suggest that for this sample, increased use of

marijuana or cocaine is associated with higher wages. The
positive relationship between drug use and the wage does not

diminish with age, but remains substantially positive. We also
investigate whether systematic differences in the return to
measures of human capital investments can explain the observed

positive relationship between drug use and wages. The results
from this analysis do not support such a hypothesis.

INTRODUCTION

The use of illicit drugs has become one of this country's most pressing
public health concerns, with the issue occupying a prominent place in the

political debate at all levels of government. An important feature of this
debate relates to the consequences of drug use in the workplace, with
particular attention being drawn to declining productivity, product quality

and public safety. Economists have developed several theoretical models
that explain the types of behavior often observed among drug users
(e.g. addiction) but little empirical work has been done to quantify the
individual differences resulting from drug use (Becker and Murphy 1988,

Iannaccone 1984, Mullahy 1985, Stigier and Becker 1977, Pollack 1970). This
paper is an attempt to identify one such difference, namely the effect of
illicit drug use on wages.

In particular, we analyze whether the frequency of use of cocaine or
marijuana affect the wage rates of a sample of young adults drawn from the

National Longitudinal Survey of the Work Experience of Youth (Center for

Human Resources 1987)1. The adverse impact of illicit drug (i.e. cocaine
or marijuana) use on the physical and psychological veil being of

individuals has been extensively documented2. The health effects of

illicit drug use are both acute (iediate or short term) and chronic (long
term) in nature. With respect to cocaine, the acute effects include raised
blood pressure, hyperactivity, seizures and heart failure, and the chronic
effects include anxiety, irritability and paranoia (Stone—Fromme and Xagen

1984, Long 1986, Kozel and Adams 1985). In the case of marijuana, the acute
symptoms include paranoia, memory loss and lack of coordination with some
chronic effects being decreased motivation and irritability (Jones and

Lovin.ger 1985, Mann 1985). Given this medical background and the assumption

1103e

—1—

that employees receive the value of their marginal product as pay, we would
expect to find that Illicit drug use would be associated with lower levels

of productivity and thus lower wages (Berger and Leigh 1988). In fact
however, the results of this analysis do not appear to support such a

conclusion. Among the current sample of young, working adults, illicit drug
use is not associated with lover wages.

The balance of the paper will be divided into the following parts. In
the next section the empirical model used in the analysis will be

described. This section will be followed by a description and examination
of the current data set. The results of estimating the models will follow
the data section, and the paper will close with a summary of results and
suggestions for future research.

EMPIRICAL SPECIFICATION

The detrimental physical and psychological effects of drug use suggest

that wages should be a negative function of illicit drug use. Following
closely to Becker and Murphy (1988), wages are a function of the stock of an
addictive good's (drug) consumption capital and the stock of human capital;

(1) W =

f(S,

H),

where W is the wage (in period t

drug consumption

capital, and

— subscripts

omitted), S is the stock of

H is the stock of human capital. The wage is

expected to be negatively related to the stock of drug consumption capital

and positively related to the stock of human capital. Estimation of a
simple human capital wage function, augmented by the addition of a measure
of drug use however, is not appropriate for several reasons, which upon
examination suggest

(i.

estimating a simultaneous model of wages and

e. drug consumption capital).

drug

use

The fact that drugs are a consumption good makes the level of such use

dependent on income. Since wages constitute a large portion of income, an
increase in the wage will lead to an increase in the consumption of drugs,

assuming drugs are a normal good. Thus, individuals with higher wages will
be expected to have higher levels of drug use. For example, the popularity
of cocaine use among the college educated, who would also be expected to
have a high relative wage (i.e. income), might be partly due to an income

effect associated with the consumption of drugs3. The popular media is
also full of references to the use of drugs, especially cocaine, by highly
paid athletes, entertainers and business people. There is a perception,
grounded in economic theory, that higher wages leads to increased drug use.

Thus, when examining the relationship between drug use and wages, it is
necessary to develop a model in which the causality runs in both directions.

A second reason for expecting the causality between drug use and wages
to be interdependent, also relies on the nature of drug use as a consumption

good. The motivation here comes from the Michael and Becker (1973), or
Stigler and Becker (1977), treatment of drugs and wages as inputs used in

household production. Depending upon the relationship between drugs and
time in household production, there can be a positive or negative dependence

of drug use on the wage4. The wage Is assumed to be equal to the value of
time in home production.

A final reason why a single equation model is inappropriate, is due to
the fact that unobserved attributes that affect wages could also influence

drug use. In particular, Becker and Murphy (1988) demonstrate that
individuals with a high rate of time preference are much more likely to use

drugs. This is due to the fact, that drug use involves a tradeoff between
current and future utility.5 It is also the case, however, that

1103e

—3—

individuals with higher rates of time preference will select themselves into
jobs that have flatter age (experience) earnings profiles (Mincer 1974).
Thus we would expect drug use to be correlated with the error of a wage

equation. Those with high, but unobserved, rates of time preference will
have high drug use levels and

high

wage levels. This could be true for

other unobserved attributes, such as anti—social attitudes, which could lead
to similar biases but in the opposite direction as that suggested for the

rate of time preference. The problem is one of unobserved heterogeneity

which

is

common to many

cross

sectional analyses. Some authors have

for this problem by using some type of instrumental variable. In
this paper we utilize a two equation model, and Two Stage Least Squares
corrected

(2SLS) estimation method that can

be interpreted as an instrumental variable

procedure6.

The three problems outlined above, prevent
from

simple OLS wage regressions

yielding unbiased estimates. One solution to

this

problem is to

estimate a simultaneous system of equations with wages and drug use being

jointly determined. The models that will be estimated in this paper are:

2)W

a0 +aX+aD+E
1
2
w

3)D = bo+blZ+b2W+Ed
where W is the natural log of the wage, D is drug use, X and Z are vectors

of independent variables, the aj and b1 are parameters and Ed are
error terms. The wage equation includes a measure of ability (armed forces
qualifications test), experience, experience squared, education, education
squared, an interaction between ability and education, an interaction

between experience and education, demographic variables (e.g. age, race) and

llO3e

—4—

several geographic measures. Also included in the wage model are several
lifestyle variables intended to control for sample heterogeneity7. The
drug use equation contains psychological, lifestyle, household structure,

and demographic variables as well as income and price variables (Kandel and

Logan 1984, Becker and Murphy 1988). In the drug equation, geographical
location dmuny variables should be a suitable proxy for price, since this is

a cross sectional analysis. The system represented by equations 2 and 3
will be estimated by a 2$LS procedure.

Equation 3, is inconsistent in several respects, with the model of

"rational addiction" proposed by Becker and Murphy (1988). In their model
the variable of interest is the addictive good's (drug) stock of consumption
capital, while presently, we use the frequency of lifetime, or past thirty

day, drug use as a measure of the stock of drug consumption capital. These
two concepts are clearly different. Our measure ignores depreciation of the
stock and intensity (dosage) of use. We also ignore the intertemporal
aspects of the Becker and Murphy (1988) model which links current

consumption to past and future consumption (or prices). The current data
are not adequate for the purposes of estimating a dynamic model. We do,
however, include variables, such as family structure at age 14 and
psychological indices measured during the late teens, that gauge early

lifetime events that would be expected to influence drug use. In stary,
to the extent that drugs are an addictive good among this sample, equation 3

probably suffers from some mis—specification. As Becker and Murphy (1988)
point out, however, "Addictions involve an interaction between persons and

goods.". It is quite possible that drugs are not an addictive good for the
majority of this sample, and as such the problem of mis—specification would
be diminished.

1103e

There are several problems, associated with estimating equations 2 and

3,

that distinguish them from the ordinary 2SLS procedure. The first

problem is that the measure of drug use available in the current data set is

a categorical variable (see table 1). Thus, the drug use equation, (3), is
best estimated by maximum likelihood methods. In this paper we make use of
a probit procedure for the binary case (i.e. no use/use), and an ordered
probit procedure for the multinominal case (i.e. no use, moderate use, heavy

use). It has been shown that the estimates obtained from two stage
procedures, similar to that of the ordinary 2SLS procedures, but with a
qualitative or limited dependent variable, are consistent estimates of the

true parameters (Amemiya 1979, Maddala 1983, Forrest and Nelson 1978). The
appropriate standard errors for the models are somewhat complex and need to
be constructed separately8.

A second problem has to do with the fact that the analysis is focused on
wage rates, and so by definition only those individuals with positive wages

are included in the sample. This "sample selection" criteria has the well
known

effect

of leading to biased estimates if ignored (Heckrnan 1976,

1979). Fortunately, it has been shown that the Meckman two stage procedure
can

be

applied as part of the two stage least squares procedure (Maddala

1983). In estimating the system of equations the inverse Mill's ratio of
the Heckman procedure, is simply added to the model as another exogenous
variable9.

To sarize, it is the dual nature of drug use as a consumption and
investment good that necessitates modifying the standard procedure for

estimating the wage equation. The high probability that the inclusion of
drugs in a wage regression will lead to biased estimates calls for the use

of the 2SLS technique. A description of the data will be given next.

THE DATA
The data set used for this analysis is the youth cohort of the N'LS in

the year 1984. In 1984 the NLS

included

questions regarding the

respondent's current and lifetime frequency of use for a variety of illicit

drugs. The youth cohort (18—27 in 1984) are a group of particular interest,
since much of the concern over the use of illicit drugs is centered on this
age range.

It is unfortunate, however, that an older cohort was not asked

similar questions in order to better identify the long term effects of drug

use. It also should be pointed out that the respondents were only
questioned about their drug use at the 1984 interview, and this limits the
use of the data set to primarily a cross sectional analysis of the

relationship between wages and drug use. The questions regarding drug use
are not extensive enough to build a longitudinal record for individuals,
which would be necessary in developing a dynamic empirical model compatible
with that of Becker and Murphy (1988).

The current sample consists of males and females who were not in school,
not in the military and not self employed at the time of the 1984

interview. In addition to these criteria, individuals with missing data
were also excluded from the analysis

persons of which 3901 (47%) were male and 4381 (53%) were female. Among the
entire sample, 69 percent were currently employed at the time of the 1984

interview. Male respondents had a labor force participation rate of 77
percent, while female respondents had a 62 percent participation rate as
measured at the time of the 1984 interview.

being; the increase in years of experience and education, especially for
women, the decrease in the proportion of the sample that is black, and the

decrease in the mean number of dependents for women. An interesting finding
is the relative similarities between working males and females with regard

to experience, tenure and education. The mean wage of males however is
significantly higher than that of females.

Of particular interest in this study are the drug variables. The
respondents were asked about lifetime and current (past 30 days) frequency

of use for cocaine and marijuana. The responses to these questions were
grouped by intervals. Table 1 is a frequency distribution of respondents by

amomt of reported drug use. Table 1 is divided into males (A) and females
(B). About 23 percent of employed male respondents had reported cocaine use
over their lifetime and about 6 percent reported that they bad used cocaine

1103e

in the last 30 days. For females, these figures are 15 percent for lifetime
use and 3.5 percent for current use. These numbers are somewhat lower than

those

in a National Institute on Drug Abuse study of 18—25 year old adults,

that reported lifetime prevalence in 1982 of 35 percent for males and 22
percent for females (Kozel and Adams 1985)12. The same study reported

past 30 day prevalence of 9 percent for males and 5 percent for females.

use.

The severity of drug use cannot be identified since dosage is not
included as a question, but one would expect to find that dosage and

frequency of use are positively correlated. Among male respondents who have
tried cocaine in their lifetimes, approximately half have tried it 1—9 times
and only about 15 percent of the users (3.5 percent of the total male

sample) have used cocaine more than 100 times. Among male respondents who
reported lifetime marijuana use there are quite a few with a large number of

reported times of use. Over 37 percent of the sample of users has used
marijuana more
repeated

than 100

among female

times. The same pattern observed for males is

respondents. About half of female cocaine users have

tried cocaine approximately 1—9 times and about 10 percent of the users

reported a frequency of use of 100 or more times. The relative severity of
marijuana use among females is comparable to that among males.

ESTIMATION RESULTS
A variety of empirical models were estimated in order to provide

some

benchmark (OLS) estimates and to highlight the main questions of this

paper. The variables of Interest in the analysis are the reported frequency
of use of cocaine and marijuana. Within each drug category the distinction
between current (past 30 day) and lifetime use is exploited in order to

compare short and long term effects. The drug use measures were entered
into the model in three forms; as a linear term, as a binary (no use/use)

measure, and as a series (no use, moderate use, heavy use) of duiy

variables. OLS estimates were generated for each gender group, drug type
(4), and fmctional form (3) with the results listed in table 314, All
models were estimated with and without a correction for the "selectivity"

bias which arises due to the labor force participation decision of the

ll03e

—10—

respondents. Table 3 contains the estimates of the coefficients for the
drug variables. As columns 1 and 3 of table 3 illustrates, there are
several anomalous results that present themselves at this stage of the

analysis. Many of the coefficients associated with the drug use variables
are positive and significant, indicating that increased drug use leads to

higher wages. The only exception to this conclusion is for the male sample
when estimating the effects of marijuana use on wages. These are surprising
results in light of the evidence regarding the effects of drug use on the
physical and psychological well being of individuals, and results that would
appear to support the hypothesis that a more sophisticated econometric

approach is warranted. The first explanation that most economists would
appeal to in order to explain these results, is that the positive
correlation observed in table 3 is primarily the result of an income

effect. This is precisely what has been argued in the earlier part of this

paper. Thus the next part of the analysis is concerned with the results of
estimating a simultaneous system of equations, where drug use and wages are
endogenous.

before moving to this set of results, three additional points need to be

raised. The first is that the correction for sample selectivity did
remarkably little to change the results listed in table 3. The selection
equation includes all of the other exogenous variables from the wage (2) and

drug (3) equations. It is a reduced form model, since both wages and drug
use might be expected to influence labor force participation. The
correction term (LAMBDA) itself is always insignificant when included in the
regressions, and the effect of this procedure on the parameter estimates of

the model is negligible. In light of these results, all remaining models
will be estimated excluding the correction term, and the procedures used to
derive

effects associated with increased marijuana use among females, are smaller
and less

and significant. For the male sample, the results of table 4 are
quite similar to those in table 3. The effects of lifetime cocaine use are
positive, significant, and of the same approximate magnitude. The results
of table 4 are generally consistent with those of table 3, and both are

quite surprising. To

further explore the relationship between drug use and

wages, a simultaneous equations model was estimated.

variables. A linear form of drug use (i.e.,

the drug use variable was used, and the system was estimated in two ways;

equation by a probit procedure. Finally, an ordered probit

model of drug use was estimated, and the predicted probabilities of being in
a particular drug use category (i.e., no use/moderate use, heavy use) were

used in place of the series of diy variables in the wage equation.
The estimation of the structural equations raises the issue of

identification. In this paper it was assumed that the non—wage income
(OThINC) of the respondent is not a factor that affects productivity, and

thus wageg7. Given this assumption, tests of overidentifying
restrictions were carried out on a subset of variables that were thought to

affect drug use, but not wages. The test consists of estimating the exactly
identified model of wages, and testing sets of coefficients using the
appropriate submatrices of the estimated covariance matrix (Wegge 1978,

Bwang 1980). It is important to note, that in several of the models the
covariance matrix needs to be estimated with proper attention to the fact
that one of the right hand side variables is a predicted value (Murphy and

Topel 1985). The results from these tests yielded a set of three variables
that along with non—wage income could be excluded from the wage equation.

This set of variables includes the frequency of religious attendance in
1979, the number of current dependents, and the number of delinquent acts in

1980. This set was tested for all of the models that result from using a

different drug measure. Several other lifestyle and psychological
variables, however, were included in the wage equation. These variables
include, among others, whether the respondent lived with both parents at age
14 (PARENT), a self esteem scale measured in 1979 (ESTEEII), a measure of the

respondents feelings about control over their lives as of 1980 (ROTTER), and

age of the respondent. The results from these models are listed in

llO3e

—13—

table 518

Columns 1 and 3 contain the results for the 18—27 year old

cohort and columns 2 and 4 contain the results for the 23—27 year old

cohort. What table 5 clearly illustrates, is that the anomalous results
obtained from the OLS regressions are not due to the hypothesized income

effect or other simultaneity biases. The magnitude of the positive
relationship between wages and drug use has been increased. The changes are
dramatic. The results hold uniformly for both gender groups, age groups and
both types of drugs. The size of the effect of drug use on wages is
substantial. For example, the results indicate that male respondents who
have tried cocaine earn about 21—22 percent more per hour, than respondents

who have never tried cocaine. The same figure for marijuana is 17—18
percent. Among the female sample, users of cocaine are predicted to earn
about 6 percent more per hour than non—users, and for marijuana the same

figure is 7—8 percent. It should be noted that many of the effects of drug
use on wages are insignificant, although quite large in size. This is
especially true for the female sample. The two stage procedure used to
estimate the model often results in large standard errors, and less precise

estimates. The most powerful finding of table 5, however, is the virtual
absence of negative drug effects, and the relatively large magnitudes of the
positive effects.

When drug use is constrained to be a linear measure, and estimated by
OLS methods, the sign of the drug coefficient is uniformly positive, and in
the case of the male sample, always significant at conmionly accepted levels

of significance. Several other results in table 5, however, especially
among the female sample, suggest that the effect of drug use on wages is

non—linear. There appears to be a large positive return to initiation into
drug use, but as the frequency of use grows, the positive effect tends to

llO3e

—14—

diminish. This raises an interesting question concerning the nature of the
effects of drug use on wages. The current data are unable to answer this
question satisfactorily, since drug use is measured by intervals with
relatively large ranges (see table 1).

There does not appear to be any discernable pattern regarding the
differences in the effect on wages of current (i.e. past 30 day use) versus

lifetime drug use. In some cases, such as cocaine use among males, the
current effects tend to be much larger thin the lifetime effects, while in

other cases the reverse is true. Also, there no longer appears to be a
diminishing of the drug effects with age among the female sample, as that
exhibited between table 3 and 4.

The simultaneous framework that has been utilized to this point, is not
useful for investigating whether the positive relationship between drug use
and wages is a result of the drug user's relatively high rate of time

preference. To recall, it was hypothesized that an individual who uses
drugs would also be more likely not to invest in on—the—job training, and
could potentially have a flatter wage profile, but a higher wage at this

point in their lives. In order to investigate this, and other differences
in the returns to various human capital measures, an endogenous switching
regression model of wages will be estimated (Lee 1978, Maddala 1983).
Separate wage regressions will be estimated for drug users and non—users.
The dependence of drug use on the wage is retained through the estimation of

an equation which determines selection into drug use. The model can be
represented as follows:19

The model assumes that u, e1 and e2 are distributed multivariate

normal. This i a simultaneous system of equations with 'selectivity based
on a probit criteria function." In their current form, OLS methods will
yield biased estimates of equations 5 and 6, since the expected value of' the

error terms are not equal to zero. This problem can be rectified by
applying a tvo stage procedure (Reckman 1976, Lee et al. 1980). The first
stage is to obtain probit estimates for the reduced form of equation 4, and
the second stage is to use the estimates from the first stage to construct
an additional regressor for each wage equation, that along with its

parameter, measure the expected value of the error terms in equations 5 and

6 conditional upon drug use. To complete the second stage, an OLS wage
regression is estimated which includes the additional selection (into drug

use) term. Tables 6 and 7 contain the results for this model. Table 6

sarjzes the effect of an additional year of experience, education, and
age on the wage. Table 7 lists the predicted wage differentials.
The positive relationship between drug use and wages might arise from
differences in the returns to experience and other human capital variables.

It was argued earlier that a particularly important variable in this respect

is labor market experience. Drug users could be systematically choosing
jobs with flatter experience/earnings profiles, and be receiving higher

wages than non—users at this relatively early point in their careers. The
results reported in table 6, however, do not support such a hypothesis. The

market experience are

in fact larger for drug users in half

of the cases listed in table 6. This is especialy true for males, who also
had the moat statistically significant drug effects. The respondents age
was also included in the analysis, and

it

is expected that age and

experience would be highly correlated. Thus, an examination of the returns
to age could provide the support for the hypothesis that drug

users

The predicted wage differentials between drug users and non—users are

contained in table 20• The first col

of table 7 lists differences in

the endowments or mean characteristics of the sample, while column 2 lists

the differences in the return to those characteristics. In general, the
differences in endowments tend to be quite small, with the only exception
being female cocaine users who would be expected to have a wage 9 to 12

percent higher than non—users. The expected wage differentials due to
differences in the returns to observed characteristics, however, are quite
large, and in most cases would predict that non—users would have a much

larger wage than drug users. For example, among males

with the large positive effects of drug use

obtained in table 5. It is important to note that column 2 is calculated
without the inclusion of the intercept or selection term. Column 3 adds the

llO3e

—17—

differences in the intercepts between non—users and drug users Co the

figures in column 2. This additional component of the predicted wage
differential leads to dramatic changes in the sign and magnitude of the

predicted difference. It is now the case that male drug users can expect a
substantial premium (14—26 percent) over non—users, and female non—users
would be predicted to have a much smaller premium than those in column 2,
and in some cases would be predicted to have a lower wage than drug users.
Thus it is not the returns to observed characteristics that is responsible

for the positive effects of drug use on the wage, but the unobserved
component as evidenced by the large differences in the intercepts of the
wage models between drug users and non—users.
The importance of several variables in explaining differences in drug

use can be seen by examining the results from the estimated drug use

models. The drug use equations were estimated as reduced forms, since there
were no variables that a priori would be expected to affect the wage, but

not drug use. The main concern of this paper is the effects of drug use on
wages, and not the reverse. Table 8 contains the estimates of a model of
lifetime cocaine use where the dependent variable is a binary measure, and
the model is estimated by probit methods21.

An

interesting

finding contained in table 8 is related to the size and

significance of the variables used to identify the wage equation. The
effects of frequency of religious attendance, number of delinquent acts, and

non—wage income are all significant predictors of drug use. Several of the
other lifestyle variables are also significant, and the signs of the

coefficients are generally what would be expected. For example, respondents
who live at home with their families are less likely to have tried cocaine,
as are those respondents who had a two parent household during their early

llO3e

—18—

teen years. It is also the case that non—wage income is positive and
usually significant. This could support the idea that drugs are a normal
consumption good, but the reduced form nature of the model wakes it hard to
interpret the results.

CONCLUSION

Contrary to popular belief, the results of this analysis suggest that
illicit drug use, as measured by the reported frequency of use, does not

have the expected negative affects on wages. The analysis actually implies
that increased frequency of drug use leads to higher wages. The results
appear to be consistent across gender groups, age cohorts and drug type

(i.e. cocaine and marijuana). The present research also demonstrates the
sensitivity of the parameter estimates to the method of estimation. The
2SLS procedure produced results that were radically different from those of

OLS. The fact that the results of the 2SLS procedure, as compared to the
OLS results, were even more contrary to what was expected, should not
diminish the significance of the findings.

The results also indicated that the positive relationship between drug

use and wages does not diminish with age. This is inconsistent with the
hypothesis that drug users invest less time in on—the--job training and

therefore would have flatter age earnings profiles, but higher wages. This
explanation of the observed positive relationship between drug use and wages

was also rejected by the evidence from a switching regression model. The
results of this analysis indicate in some cases steeper experience/earnings

profiles for drug users, and smaller returns to other observed

characteristics. Predicted wage differentials were also calculated, and
show that drug users are in moat cases expected to have higher wages than

1103e

non—users. The wage premium, however, comes not from differences in the
returns to observed characteristics, but due to differences in the

unobserved characteristics embodied in the intercept of the models. The
positive wage premium generally observed is consistent with the results from
models in which drug use enters directly into the equation.
The analysis was imperfect in many regards, and there is much need for

further research. The first problem pertaining to this issue, is the
possibility of under—reporting of drug use. If heavy users of drugs
severely tmer reported their usage and were also doing poorly in the labor
market, this might explain the observed results. There does appear to be
some under—reporting in the sample mainly for cocaine, although of what

nature is not determinable. Less than 1 percent of the respondents had
missing values for their responses to the drug questions. Related to this
is the idea that the measure of drug use is inadequate for the intended

purposes. Using the Becker and Murphy (1988) terminology, it is the stock
of drug consumption capital that is of importance but which is unobservable.

Secondly, there are several unobservable variables that are expected to

be of importance, but were not accounted for in the analysis. These
variables include an individuals subjective rate of time preference, and a
respondents demand for health care or other factors affecting the

depreciation of the stock of drug capital. Any increase in health capital
might offset the negative health consequences of drug use (Grossman 1972,

Becker and Murphy 1988). Finally, the 2SLS procedure is based on several
assumptions

been violated in the analysis. The drug

true value. This would affect the results of the parameter estimates of
drug use in the wage equation.

We can derive (estimate) the effect of a change in the wage (W) on the
demand for drugs (1)). Then we will know if the factors are Hicks—Allen
substitutes or complements. If they are complements, then drug use
would depend negatively on the wage.
5. There is a tradeoff between current and future utility because past
consumption raises the price of future consumption (tolerance). As the
stock of drug capital increases, the marginal utility of drug use
declines. See Becker and Murphy (1988) for a thorough treatment.
6. This procedure, although in the same spirit as that of say Altonji and
Shakotko (1987), does not totally resolve the basic problem of
mis—specification. The analysis does include a wealth of explanatory
variables that should reduce sample heterogeneity problems.

7. The lifestyle variables were included due to the fact that a test for
overidentifying restrictions of the wage model rejected the hypothesis
that they should be excluded.

8. It is important to note that the standard errors derived from the second
stage OLS estimates of the wage model (equation 2) are incorrect when
the measure of drug use is replaced by its predicted value. In this
paper, drug use is estimated in a variety of ways; by OLS when drug use
is a linear measure, by probit methods when drug use is transformed into
a binary measure and by an ordered probit procedure when drug use is
transformed into a series of duy variables. In the first case, when
drug use is estimated by OLS methods the correct standard errors are
those that are derived in any econometrics text (Ementa 1986) and
produced automatically by most statistical packages (SAS). When drug
use is estimated by probit methods the correct standard errors need to
be carefully constructed. Maddala (1983), and Murphy and Topel (1985)
give the appropriate expressions for calculating the correct standard
errors of this model, and these are the estimates used throughout this
paper when drug use is estimated as a binary variable. In regard to the
case, where drug use is estimated by an ordered probit procedure, this
paper makes use of the standard errors from an OLS regression, which are
underestimates of the true values (Murphy and Tope]. 1985).
9. The model described be equations 2 and 3 thus becomes the following;

2a)Wa0+a1X+a2D+ if W>O
3a)fl=bO+blz+b2W+Ed if WO
4)WD0
if WQ
The problem in this case, is that the expected value of the error term
is not equal to zero for the structural or the reduced form equations.
Thus it is necessary When estimating the reduced form model to account
for the "selection effect". Carrying out the usual two stage procedure
(Eeckan 1977, 1979) when estimating the reduced form equations should
yield consistent estimates of the endogenous variables, which can in
turn be used to obtain estimates of the structural equations. The
standard errors should, theoretically, account for the fact that not
only are the endogenous variables replaced with a predicted value but so
is an additional regressor, namely the selection term. The standard
errors used in this paper when estimating the model with "selectivity"
are those derived from the procedures outlined in footnote 8. The fact
that there is an additional estimated variable is ignored. It is
important to note that the problem would be observationally identical if
only equation 2a was subject to selection, since both reduced forms
would contain the selection term.
Since equation 3a is sometimes presented as a binary variable and
estimated by probit methods, adding the inverse mills ratio amo!mts to
assuming that Ed, the error term, is normally distributed conditional
on all the regressors including the inverse mills ratio.

10. Once again the problem of "selectivity" arises. If the exclusion of
these individuals is systematically related to wage rates, the estimates
of parameters of the model will be biased. Presently it is assumed to
be random. Less than 1 percent of the sample were missing responses to
the drug questions.

NLS see NLS Handbook. (Center for Human Resources 1988).
12. This is an appropriate study for comparison since the sample was 18—25
in 1982 which would make them 20—27 in 1984 which is approximately the
age of the current sample.
13. The large proportion of respondents who live in the south might be the
reason for part of this discrepancy. People in the south have lower
rates of reported use of illicit drugs (Abelson and Miller 1985,
Johnston, O'Malley and Bacbman 1986).
14. The parameter estimates of a representative model are listed in appendix

results were unchanged from those reported in the paper. See footnote 9

The estimates are similar to those in table AS of the appendix.

an exactly identified model (Huang 1980).

2. The NbA (U.S. Dept. of MHZ) figures come from the National Household
Survey of Drug Use and are for a sample of individuals with an
age
range of 18—25.
3. The National u.S. (Johnston et al.) figures come from

figures
are from a sample of individuals with an age range of 18—27The
in 1965.
4. The New York State (Kandel and Logan) figures come from a sample of
New York State High School graduates who were interviewed in 1970
and again an 1980. The mean age of this sample was 24.7 in 1980.
