    "abstract": "\n\nThe rise of shadow banking and attendant financial fragility in China can be traced to intensified deposit competition following the global financial crisis (GFC). Deposit competition intensified after the GFC because the GFC slowed down banks\u2019 deposit growth from cross-border money inflows and simultaneously led to fiscal stimulus supported by banks\u2019 credit expansion. Exploiting the fact that one big state-owned bank was particular affected by the GFC through these two channels, we document\u2014by exploring small and medium-sized banks\u2019 branch-level overlap with this big bank\u2014that deposit competition increased banks\u2019 reliance on shadow banking. In particular, exposed banks issued Wealth Management Products (WMPs)\u2014short-maturity, off-balance-sheet substitutes for deposits\u2014creating rollover risks for the issuers, as reflected by higher yields on new WMPs, higher borrowing rates in the interbank market, and lower stock-market performance during liquidity stress.\n\n",
