    "abstract": "\n\nWe examine union-non-union differentials in wages and hours in the United States over the last 50 years using data from the Current Population Survey (CPS).  The regression-adjusted difference between union members\u2019 and non-members\u2019 hourly earnings has been falling since the Great Recession.  The union differential in weekly wages has been more stable.  Although it fell by around 5 log points during COVID it remains 15 log points.  This weekly earnings differential arises from both a higher hourly wage of around 10 log points and longer working hours (5 log points).  The working hours differential partly reflects unions\u2019 ability to tackle under-employment, such that union workers work closer to the hours they desire than their non-union counterparts.  The traditional focus on hourly wage differentials underplays the important role trade unions play in maintaining members\u2019 weekly earnings by ensuring workers receive the paid hours they desire.\n\n",
