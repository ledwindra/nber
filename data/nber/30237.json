    "abstract": "\n\nWe use a unique data set of linked birth records from Florida to analyze the intergenerational transmission of health at birth by parental gender. We show that both paternal and maternal birth weights signi\ufb01cantly predict the child\u2019s birth weight, even after accounting for all genetic and environmental factors that are common and time-invariant within a family. Our estimates reveal that a one standard deviation increase in mother\u2019s birth weight (535 grams) translates into a 0.13-0.24 standard deviations increase in child\u2019s birth weight (70-128 grams), accounting or not for maternal grandmother \ufb01xed e\ufb00ects. On the father\u2019s side, we \ufb01nd that a one standard deviation increase in father\u2019s birth weight (563 grams) translates into a 0.10-0.15 standard deviations increase in child\u2019s birth weight (56-78 grams), accounting or not for paternal grandmother \ufb01xed e\ufb00ects. The signi\ufb01cant role of both maternal and paternal health at birth in explaining o\ufb00spring health at birth is con\ufb01rmed when using alternative metrics: intrauterine growth, being small for gestational age or being too heavy (i.e., macrosomic).\n\n",
