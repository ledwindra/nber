    "abstract": "\n\nWe conduct a lab-in-the-field experiment to identify parents' preferences for investing in their children. The experiment exogenously varied the short-run returns to educational investments to identify how much parents care about maximizing total household earnings, minimizing cross-sibling inequality in \"outcomes\" (child-level earnings), and minimizing cross-sibling inequality in \"inputs\" (child-level investments). We show that while parents place some weight on maximizing earnings, they also display a strong preference for equality in inputs, forgoing roughly 40% of their potential earnings or 90% of a day\u2019s wage to equalize inputs. We find no evidence that parents care about equalizing outcomes.\n\n",
