    "abstract": "\n\nWe use a detailed micro dataset on product availability to construct a direct high-frequency measure of consumer product shortages during the 2020\u20132021 pandemic. We document a widespread multi-fold rise in shortages in nearly all sectors early in the pandemic. Over time, the composition of shortages evolved from many temporary stockouts to mostly discontinued products, concentrated in fewer sectors. We show that unexpected product shortages have signi\ufb01cant in\ufb02ationary e\ufb00ects within three months. We develop a model of inventories in a sector facing both demand and cost disturbances, and use the observed joint dynamics of stockouts and prices to show that these e\ufb00ects can be associated with elevated cost of replenishing inventories.\n\n",
