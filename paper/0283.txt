Temporary Income Taxes and Consumer
Spending

Both economic theory and casual empirical observation of the U.S.
econonly suggest that spending propensities from temporary tax
changes are smaller than those from permanent ones, but neither
provides much guidance about the magnitude of this difference.

l'his paper offers new empirical estimates of this difference and
finds it to he quite substantial. The analysis is based on an amend-

ment of the standard distributed lag version of the permanent inconic hypothesis that distinguishes temporary taxes froni other income on the grounds that the former are "more transitory." This
amendment, which is broadly consistent with rational expectations.
leads to a nomilinear consumption function. Though the standard
error is unavoidably large, the point estimate suggests that a temporary tax change is treated as a 50-50 blend of a normal income tax

change and a pure windfall. Over a 1-year planning horizon, a
temporary tax change is estimated to have only a little more than half

the impact of a permanent tax change of equal magnitude, and a
rebate is estimated to have only about 38 percent of the impact.

In 1968, faced with a classic case of demand inflation, Congress
enacted a temporary increase in personal income tax payments to

curb aggregate demand. In 1975, near the trough of our worst postwar recession, Congress enacted a tax rebate and other temporary
decreases in taxes and increases in transfer payments designed to
stimulate aggregate demand. Questions have been raised about the
effectiveness of both measures.

The questions have both theoretical and empirical rools. On
theoretical grounds, the permanent income—life cycle hypothesis
seems to argue that temporary income tax changes should have little
effect on consumer spending in principle. On empirical grounds, data
on consumer behavior seem to suggest that the impacts of the two
temporary taxes on spending were also small in practice. In 1968, the
savings rate fell from 7.5 percent in the quarter immediately preceding the tax surcharge (1968:2) to only 5.6 percent in the first quarter

of the surtax, suggesting that consumers kept spending despite the
tax. In 1975, the savings rate ballooned from 6.4 percent just prior to

the rebate to a stunning 9.7 percent in the quarter of the rebate

(1975:2), suggesting that little of the rebate was spent.
The purpose of this paper is to study these two temporary tax
changes in some detail. Precisely what prediction does economic
theory make about the relative effectiveness of temporary versus
permanent tax changes? And what conclusions can be reached from
U.S. time-series data? The fact that the Carter administration asked

for (hut did not get) a repeat performance of the rebate in 1977

suggests that there is more than academic interest in the answers to
these questions.
Section 1 outlines the theoretical issues, beginning with an idealized

life-cycle model and proceeding to introduce some important "real
world" considerations. Since the discussion shows quite clearly that
the issue is an empirical one, Section II reviews previous empirical
work on the subject very briefly. Section III explains the underlying
basis of the empirical model of this paper, relating it to recent literature on rational expectations and the permanent income hypothesis
(PIH), and then Sections IV and V show how this basic conceptual
framework was converted into art operational empirical model. The
estimates are presented and analyzed in Section VI, and Section VII
summarizes the main conclusions.

I. The Implications of Theory: Pure and Impure
I. The Pure Permanent Income—L[e Cycle

Theoiy

As Eisner (1969) pointed out some time ago, the PIH casts doubt on
the effCctivéness of income tax changes that are labeled as temporary
because such measures have only minor effects on permanent income.

JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY

To develop a theoretical benchmark for the marginal propensity to consume (MPG) that the PIH suggests might apply to a temporary tax, consider a rarefied world in which consumers with exogenous earnings streams select consumption paths to maximize lifetime

utility. If capital markets are perfect, only the discounted present
values of the earnings streams matter, so suppose all households earn
a constant income y per year. Assume further that households differ

only in age, a; that the real rate of interest is zero; and that the
subjective rate of time discounting is also zero.' The question is, If
income taxes are raised by z per capita for the period from I = 0 to I =
t,, how much less will consumers spend over this interval?
In answering this question, there are three population groups to
keep track of. People who are "alive" (in the economic sense) at I = 0
and who live past the expiration of the tax suffer an income loss of t1z
over the period. If T denotes the length of life, then each such person
ofagea consumes a fraction i11(T — a) of this loss during the years in
which the temporary tax is in effect. Thus the change in consumption

per capita is C1 = zt/(T

—

a).

Old people who are alive at! = 0, but die before! = I,, lose only (T
—
a)z in income. However, since they have MPCs of unity during the
surtax period as a whole, their change in consumption per capita is
C2 = (T — a)z.
Finally, we must worry about people who are born between I = 0
and I = I,. Ii a, a negative number between 0 and —I,, denotes the age
of such a person, and he lives for 1, + a <1, years during the period 0
i,, his income loss is (I, + a)z. Since he spends a fraction (I +
a)/T of this income during the period 0 t I, the change in his
consumption is C3 = z(t, + a)2]/T.
To derive the aggregate change in per capita consumption, weight
these groups by the age distribution, considering the ages —l a
T. In the simplest case of a uniform age distribution, [(a) = lIT, the
change is

TEMPORARY INCOME TAXES

To take a concrete example, suppose the typical lifetime of a

household head as a household head is T = 50 years. Then, according
to this formula, the MPG for a 1-year tax (t = 1) is .09, while that for a
2-year tax (t = 2) is .15.2 The MPG = .09 for a 1-year temporary tax is
only a rough benchmark representing the pure PIH, and there are a

number of reasons why the theory probably systematically understates the responses of consumers to temporary taxes (see below), so

we should not take this number too seriously. Still, there are two
lessons worth drawing from this simple exercise—lessons that have
often been forgotten in the temporary-tax debate.
a) Income gains and losses from temporary taxes will eventually be

spent just like any other increment or decrement to lifetime resources: if less is spent at first (because t1 < T), then more will be spent
later. Thus if we want to inquire- about the "effectiveness" of tempo-

rary taxes, we must specify a time horizon. Over a long enough run,
they must be just as "effective" as permanent ones.
b) The so-called zero effect view—that constimers ignore the surtax
and consume as if it never happened—does not represent the PIH at
all. Instead, that theory says that consumers should spend precisely
what they would on receipt of a windfall gain (or loss) of 11z. In the
illustrative calculation, this turns out to be the "9 percent effect" view.
2.- Caveats and Imperfictions

There are several reasons why surtaxes may affect spending more
strongly than indicated by pure theory. First, tax-induced income
changes that are not consumed must be saved, If windfall gains are
used to purchase durable goods, consumer spending may rise much
more strongly than consumption; the converse may happen when
there are windfall losses. The magnitude of the marginal propensity
to spend windfalls on durable goods is, of course, an empirical question .

Second, some households may be subject to liquidity constraints
that are usually ignored by the PIH. If we stay within the certainty

context, these constrained households will react strongly to even temporary income changes.4 Thus the aggregate MPG for a temporary
tax is a weighted average of the low MPGs of unconstrained households and the high MPGs of constrained ones. Again, the importance
of this phenomenon is an empirical question.

to the uncertainty case.

Third, as Okun (1971) pointed out, consumer behavior depends on
what people believe rather than on what the government announces.
If consumers disbelieve the government when it tells them that a tax
hike is only temporary, then the spending response will be greater

than that suggested by a naive application of the PIH.5 Since the
perceived duration of the surtax, not the declared duration, is rele-

ant from the standpoint of the PIH, this too raises an empirical issue.
Finally, we must recognize the possibility that households may not
do the kind of rational long—term planning envisioned by Modigliani
and Brumberg (1954) and Friedman (1957) or, what amounts to the
same thing, have very high subjective discount rates. If they are very
shortsighted, then temporary fluctuations in disposable income may
have substantial effects on spending.

II. previous Empirical Work
Okun's (1971) study opened the empirical debate on this issue. Using
the consumption equations of four econometric models, he compared
the "full effect" view that the 1968 surtax was just as effective as a
permanent tax increase to the "zero effect" view that consumers totally
ignored the surtax. While he concluded that the full effect view fit the
data better, an intermediate "50 percent effect" view actually does

better than either extreme.6 Springer (1975) criticized Okun's
econometric procedures and then performed a similar experiment
with a consumption function based on the PIH. He concluded that
the zero effect view perfornied better.
juster (1977), using a series of savings equations based on the
Hoitthakker-Talor (1966) model, reached conclusions about the
1975 rebate similar to those of Okitn for the 1968 surtax. But Modigliani and Steindel (1977) found that the rebate had very little impact

over a horizon of 1 or 2 quarters. Their modified version of the
life—cycle niodel implied, however, a virtually full effect view over a
6-quarter horizon. Modigliani and Steindel assumed that the nonrehate portions of the 1975 tax cuts were treated like permanent taxes
and handled the 1968 surtax with dummy variables.
The existing empirical literature thus offers little consensus. The
issue seems quite open.

III. The Distributed Lag Model of Consumption
The basic vehicle for investigating the effectiveness of temporary
income taxes in this paper is the distributed lag version of the PIH.
This point has rather less cogency with respect to tax cuts; but here tOo Consumers
may believe t hen to he more permanent than the government annonnces.
On this, see Blinder and Solow (1974, pp. 1 07—9).

TEMPORARY INCOME TAXES

While this is the standard way of implementing the PIH empirically,

the recent literature on rational expectations has seemed to raise
doubts about its validity.7 This section shows how the PLH and
rational expectations together lead to an estimating equation very
much like the one I use in this paper.
As Muth (1960) pointed out, the P1 H is basically a !flOtt1(1-looking

model of consumer behavior. It states that consumers, in deciding on

their current spending, weigh their current asset holdings, their cur-

rent income from labor, and their expected future income from
labor. Specifically, permanent income at time I is defined as

Y = A, +

\z (1 + r)

where A, is the stock of real assets at the beginning of period 1, }', is

noninterest income in period 1, and
is the mathematical (i.e.,
rational) expectation of
that is formed at time 1. (By convention,

= Y,.) However, if the stochastic process generating income can be

described by a time-series model such as
where €, is

= a Y,_1 + aJ,_2 + . . . + a1 }',__ + €,,
a white noise error term, then the resulting empirical

model of consumption will be bakward looking. For example, if the
theoretical consumption function is
C, = + kY + u,,
then the empirical consumption function will be

C, =

+ kA, + b,,Y, + h1 }',., + ... + b,,}',_,, + u,.
To see this, it is only necessary to note that the (rational) expecta—
ti()n of income in period I + s can, in view of (2), be based only on the
information set {Y,, Y,_,, Y,
}. Thus, for example,
(lj Y, + 2 )',_ I + (i '(--2 +

. + 0n+ I

+ a2), + a;,Y,_1 + . + ('+i il--fl-f I,
= (a + °2)}', + (0102 + a3)Y,_1 + .
= a11Y,,1

and so on. Substituting all such expressions into the definition (1) and

theii into the consumption function (3), it is clear that (4) is (lerived.
As pointed out by Sargent (1978) and others, the coefficients b, in
equation (4) will be complicated functions of the coefficients a in (2).
Suppose then that, as suggested by Dolde (1976), we can clistiiiguish
among two or more sources of' income whosegenerating fuiictions (2)
may differ. The PIH in conjunction with rational expectations then
See 1,iicas (1976) and esp. Hall (I 97M).

32

JOURNAl. OF PoliTiCAl. ECONOMY

implies that the h's in (4) should follow a different pattern for each
income source. A simple example will illustrate this point and also
give us some feeling for possible magnitudes. Consider several income sources, each of which is generated by a first-order autoregressive:

= p1Y1,1_1

+ €.

(5)

Working out the expectations and plugging into (1) gives us a simple
expression for the permanent income attributable to each source:
=

I +r
1+r—

Y0,

if p < 1 + r.

(6)

Notice that, despite the long time horizon contemplated by the PIH,
consumption depends only on current income. In general, consumption will depend on past income only up to lag n, where ii + 1 is the
longest lag considered in equation (2).
Now compare two income sources, one of which is entirely permanent (p = 1) and the other of which is entirely transitory (p = 0). A
$1.00 increase in the permanent component will, according to (6),
raise permanent income by $(l + r)Ir and thus raise consumption by

$k(1 + r)/r. This may imply a very large immediate spending response.8 By contrast, a $1.00 fluctuation in the purely transitory
component will, again according to (6), raise permanent income by
only $1.00 and thus raise consumption by only $k. The lesson, of
course, generalizes and applies far beyond the confines of first-order

autoregressives: income sources deemed to be more permanent will elicit
prompter spending responses than income sources deemed to be more temporary.

The application of this principle to permanent versus temporary

changes in taxes is apparent and immediate and was elucidated clearly
by Lucas (1976). It is the basic notion underlying the empirical model
to be developed in the next section.
However, lest confusion arise, I should stress that there is no sense
in which the rationality of expectations is either assumed or imposed
in the consumption functions estimated here. My point is only that the

distributed lag formulation of the PIH is consistent with rational
expectations. As Sargent (1978) has emphasized, rational expectations

delivers a set of restrictions across equations (2) and (4) that can be
imposed in estimating the two jointly. I have made no attempt to
impose these restrictions here because my interest was in getting the
best possible consumption-function estimates, not in testing
rationality. Furthermore, it is well known that quite different models
8 Suppose the rate of subjecttve time discounting is equal to the rate of interest, so
that a constant consumption stream is optimal, and that B is the lifetime propensity to
consume (i.e., — B is the propensity to bequeath). Then k will beBr/(1 + r), so thatk(1
+ r)/r will be B, which is close to unity.

of consumption behavior (e.g., habit persistence) can lead to an es—
tinlatilig equation ver', much like (4). It is not my purpose to discriminate among alternative ways of arriving at (4).

IV. Derivation of an Estimating Equation
The preceding discussion makes it clear that different distributed lag
coefficients might be associated with different sources of income.
While the actual empirical analysis considered four types of income,
the model is most readily explained if I suppose there are only two:
income (positive or negative) attributable to temporary tax measures,

which I denote as. S(special income"); and all other disposable
income ("regular income"), which I denote asR,. TheR, should not be

confused with permanent income, since it has both permanent and
transitory components. The basic idea underlying the estimating
equation is that S1 is identifiably "less permanent" than R1.
Suppose consumption responds to R1 according to a set of distribn. Since the w) depend
uted lag weights: w = ôC,I&R1_,j = 0, 1
on the stochastic process generating R1, it is worth reporting that the
deviations of R1 from a logarithmic time trend are well described by
the following second-order autoregressive :9

y, =

'35Yt-2,

(.09)

R2 = .91, D-W = 1.86.

(.09)

When income follows a second-order autoregressive, permanent income as defined in (1) is:

(1+r)2

(1 + r)(1 + r — a1) — a2
+

a2(1 + r)

(1 +r)(1 +r—a1)—a2 )t—I
if a1 + a2/(1 + r) < 1 + r, where K1 is the present value of the trend
component of labor income and yt and Yt-i are current and lagged
deviations from trend. Given the estimates of a1 and a2 above, and for

r=

.0074

(a 3 percent annual real interest rate), the implied

coefficients are Y =-A1 + K + IS.5y — 4•7Yt—i. This leads us to expect
a very large value of w0, followed by swiftly declining w's—possibly

even turning negative. The empirical results bear this out.
As Lucas (1976) has argued, income changes that are clearly "more

temporary" than regular income should get different spending
Standard errors are in parentheses. Longer autoregressives, however, give slightly
better fits. E.g., if t — 11 is the longest lag allowed to enter the regression, significant
coefficients are obtained at lags 1, 2, 3, 4, and 11. An F-test for the zero restrictions
implied by the second-order model, however, yields an F-ratio of only 1.77, which is

well below the critical 5 percent point of the xi distribution.

to S,, first break down S into its components:
S/ = S + S + . . +
(7)

S,

where S indicates the income gain or loss in quarter I from the ith
temporary tax. (In the empirical work, m = 3.) It will help clarify the
treatment of the S if I define a hypothetical set of lag coefficients f3 as
the effect on G of a $1.00 pure windfall gain received in quarter 1 —j.
The treatment of S depends on whether or not the ith temporary

tax is still in effect. If it is, 1 assume that S is treated as a weighted
average of regular and windfall income, so that it gets the distributed
lag weights

If the temporary tax is no longer on the books, I assume that consumers look upon S_ in retrospect as if it had been a pure windfall and so

meaning that the "long—run MPC' out of any type of income is
identical. However, the PIH-cum -rational-expectations approach
suggests no such adding-up constraint. To see this, follow Sargent
(1978, pp• 681—82) in rewriting (2) in the form X, = HX1_1 + m
(Sargent's eq. 8), where

and Y, = dX,, where d = (1, 0, . . . , 0). As Sargent notes (his eq. 9),
rational expectations implies ,X, = HX,, whence ,Y,+. = dHX,.
Substituting this into (1) gives the following expression for permanent
income:

Y =A1 + {

]xt,

which is of the form (4) with coefficients

b(b0,b1,. . . ,bn)=>.,

dHs

(1+r)

The sum of the b has no obvious interpretation. Thus, in a model
with several sources of income, there is no particular reason why the
various sets of distributed lag coefficients should have a common sum.
Where, then, does the lifetime budget constraint enter? The answer
is that (4) implies a unitary lifetime MPG for any values of k and the b,.
The proof involves some straightforward but tedious algebraic manipulations of the difference equations (4) and

A,1 = (1 + r)A1 + Y1 — C1
(10)
and hence is relegated to Appendix A.
With these preliminaries out of the way, it is easy to explain the
estimating equation. If there were no special taxes to worry about, the
basic empirical model of consumer behavior would be as follows:
C1 = k0 + k1r1Y, +

are entered into the consumption function, including the constraint

Now consider the separation of disposable income into its two

estimating equation because additional income sources were distinguished, because the distributed lag coefficients were constrained in
several ways, and because corrections were made for both heteroscedasticity and serial correlation in the error term. Details are spelled
out in Appendix B. Nonetheless (14) is the most useful form for
interpreting the estimated parameters. The model is nonlinear because of the parameter it—the crucial parameter of this study.
As noted above, theory does not imply that Lw3 = If3. To investigate this further, this adding-up constraint was imposed in (14) and its
validity tested as follows.'0 Let 1' denote the likelihood ratio. Then,
under the assumption of normality, —2 log
T log (SSRr/SSR) is
distributed as a x2 with r degrees of freedom, where: T = number of
observations (= 100 throughout this paper), SSR = minimized value
of the sum of squared residuals in the unconstrained regression (eq.

{14J in this case), SSRr = minimized value of the sum of squared
residuals in the constrained regression (obtained by imposing 1f3 =
Lw), and r = number of restrictions (= 1 in this case). As reported in
table 1, row 1, the constraint was rejected at the 10 percent level but
not at the 5 percent level. There being no persuasive theoretical
rationale for it, the constraint was dropped.
Tacitly, however, (14) embodies a number of other constraints that
are equally lacking in theoretical justification—constraints that each
type of regular income is subject to the same set of distributed lag
coefficients. These constraints were tested by a series of likelihood
ratio tests, which are described in the balance of this section.

First, "regular" disposable income was disaggregated into its two

main components—personal income and "regular" personal taxes:

(15)

Personal income is assumed to be spent according to the lag
weights
W, while regular taxes are assumed to be subject to a different set of
lag weights v. Special taxes are treated as previously explained, except that the v's replace the w's in equations (8) and (9). That is, while
the tax is on the books, a special tax is treated as a weighted average of
a permanent tax and a windfall. Thus the basic consumption function

three constraints on equation (16). Row 2 Of table 1 shows that these

rejected (x = 19; see row 4 of table 1). This time, however, the data
also rejected the adding-up constraint I4 = Iw, which therefore was
not imposed (table I, row 5). In fact, most of the difference between
the 4 and the w was in their sums; the time patterns were remarkably
siniilar.

To summarize these tests, we are left with a model that assigns
distributed lag weights w to factor income, 4 to transfers, v to

regular taxes, and to windfalls. The Iv and Iu' are apparently

equal, but the other sums are not.

V. Issues in Estimation
1. Data
Following the suggestion of Darby (1975), I used consumer expenditures, rather than pure consumption, as C1. This seems most
appropriate where the focus is on the evaluation of stabilization poi-

icy, as it is here, rather than Ofl testing the PIH. Furthermore, it

For this purpose, both employer contributions and business transfers are con-

sidered to be factor income, and the aspects of the 1975—76 tax cuts that are classified as

transfer payments in the national income accoums are grouped with temporary taxes.

avoids many complicated issues of definition (e.g., Which goods are
durables? How fast do they depreciate? etc., etc.). The cost of this
shortcut is that the theoretical interpretation of some of the parameters is lost. For example, k includes the effects of r1 on
both pure
consumption (which may be positive or negative) and spending on
durables (which should be negative). Similarly, the lag weights w
might be expected to be less smooth thanlag
theof pure consumption
behind income because of the lumpy nature of durables.13
Data for the 1968 surcharge were taken from Okun (1971) and
converted to 1972 dollars by the deflator for personal consumer
expenditures; these comprise Se'. Data for the various 1975—76 tax
cuts are shown in table 2; they were similarly deflated and segregated
into two time series. The S? series is defined

as the explicitly one-shot
measures: the tax rebates and the social security bonuses (hereafter
referred to as "the rebate"). The rest is considered as S. Since the
1975 cuts were extended several times and are now a permanent
feature of the tax code, an arbitrary decision had to be made as to

when they became "permanent."4 I decided to cut off S after

1976:2, because by then the cuts had already been extended once in
the Revenue Adjustment Act of 1975 and a second time in the Tax
Reform Act of 1976.
To account for the special features of expenditures on consumer durables, several
additional variables were tried in some earlier regressions. Neither the stock of dura-

bles, nor the relative price of durables, nor the unemployment rate succeeded in

significantly lowering the sum of squared residuals, In several
the signs of the
coefficients were even the opposite of what theory suggests.cases,
It may be that these

variables are more relevant to the choice between saving in the form of durables vs. in
financial form than they are to the choice between
and saving.
14 At an early stage of this research, I experimentedspending
with a learning model in which a
temporary tax gradually came to be considered permanent as it remained on the books
longer and longer. This experiment was unsuccessful.

40

JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY

Data on consumer net worth (W1), and its breakdown into stock
market (A1) and non—stock market (W1 — A1) components, were taken

from the data bank of the MPS model and converted to 1972 dollars.
They are based on a number of primary sources, the most important
of which is the flow of funds.
Because of the recent findings of Boskin (1978), I thought it important to use a real after-tax interest rate. Since the construction of
this series was a fairly involved affair, I explain it only in Appendix C.
2. Distributed Lag Estimation

The many distributed lags in equation (18) were estimated by an
adaptation of the Almon (1965) lag technique, as a method of conserving on parameters. Generally, a third-degree polynomial with a
zero constraint at the far end was used. Preliminary tests suggested
that these end-point constraints (w1 = 0, etc.) could not be rejected.
An unconstrained version of one specification, run as an experiment,
showed that the polynomial constraint had very little effect on the w
coefficients but did influence the f3 coefficients.
The distributed lag effects of assets were estimated as follows. In
some preliminary regressions, the two components were combined
and a cubic distributed lag over it quarters was estimated. Then the
two components were disaggregated. These preliminary tests showed
quite clearly (a) that the coefficients were not the same and (b) that the
lag was much shorter than it quarters. (As explained just below, ii was
chosen to be 7.) In the case of non—stock market wealth, an estimated
distributed lag over 4 quarters attached virtually all of the weight to
the current (start of period) value, so all lagged values were omitted.
In the case of stock market wealth, when a cubic was estimated overj
= 0, 1
7, the coefficients turned out to be almost linear and to be
virtually zero afterj = 2 (a small positive value forj = 3 and small
7). Thus a linear distributed lag overj =
negative values forj = 4
0
3 was adopted as the final specification.

The length of the distributed lag, it, was selected by running a
preliminary version of the regression for alternative values of it
ranging from 6 to 10. A very clear minimum in the sum of squared
residuals was found around n = 7 or it = 8, with the former having a
slightly better fit and slightly better coefficients. On this basis, n = 7
was selected for all subsequent work.
3. Treatment of the 1975 Rebate

As has been noted already, the model divides the 1975—76 tax cuts
into two parts: S includes the rebate, while S includes all the rest.

TEMPORARY INCOME TAXES

This makes a strong (and questionable) assumption about how consumers treated the rebate. In particular, it assumes that they treated it
just like the 1968 surcharge and the other 1975 reductions: essentially
as if a fraction A of it was a regular increase in income, while a fraction
I — A was a pure windfall. Given the nature of the rebate, this is

questionable, to say the least.
An alternative assumption—equally strong as the first—.-is that con-

sumers treated the rebate as a pure windfall right from the start.'5
While it is not obvious that this is true, since consumers might have
anticipated a repeat performance with some reasonable probability,
it does seem a plausible working hypothesis. Fortunately, it is not
difficult to modify any of the three models to accommodate this
alternative hypothesis; all that is necessary is that the lag weights /3 be

applied to S starting immediately in 1975:2. When this was done in

one version of the model, the resulting equation had virtually an
identical SSR, almost the same estimated A, and very similar implications about spending patterns out of the rebate. Thus the conclusions

of this study seem insensitive to the treatment of the rebate.

VI. Empirical Results
1. Parameter Estimates and Interpretation

Estimation was done by the numerical optimization package developed by S. M. Goldfeld and R. E. Quandt. The results from estimating equation (18) on quarterly data covering 1953: 1—1977 :4 are
presented in table 3. The number in parentheses next to each estimated coefficient is its asymptotic standard error (or rather a numerical estimate thereof).
In interpreting the standard error of the regression, it should be
mentioned that, as explained in Appendix B, the equation was actually transformed so that the left-hand variable was the average
propensity to consume (APC), CIY€, rather than consumer spending.
Thus, the standard error of .0038 is relative to a typical value for the
APC of about .90. This represents an excellent fit.'6 At 1977 income
levels, it translates to a standard error of about $3.5 billion in predicting consumer spending. Of course, obtaining a good fit with a

consumption function is hardly a notable achievement, and the
equation—like most consumption functions—does suffer from some
autocorrelation (p = .54).

°

Since the rebate was off the books by 1975:3, and hence treated as a windfall in any
case, only 1975:2 is at issue here.
The standard errors of a comparable equation in Modigliani and Steindel (1977)
are .0056 with an autocorrelation correction and .0065 without.

Turning to the coefficient estimates, the most critical parameter for
purposes of this study is A, the weight attached to regular income in
equation (8). The point estimate of .50 suggests that temporary taxes
that are still on the books are treated like 50-50 blends of windfalls
and regular taxes. However, the standard error is regrettably large;

there are, after all, pitifully few observations that can be used to
estimate A. The null hypotheses A = 0 or A = 1 can nonetheless be
tested by likelihood ratio tests. When these tests were run with equation (18) as the unconstrained regression (see table 1, rows 6 and 7),
the null hypothesis that A = 0 (temporary taxes are regarded as pure
windfalls) could not be rejected (x = 1.32). But the null hypothesis
that A = 1 (temporary taxes are regarded as regular income) could be
rejected if we were not too fussy about significance levels (x = 2.84).
I turn next to the distributed lag coefficients of the various income
terms. The w's for factor income are very large and positive at first,
then turn small and negative, and finally become positive again at the
end. This general shape accords well with our expectations.17 The 4
coefficients for transfer payments follow a similar shape but are much
more erratic and less well pinned down econometrically. A notable

the large estimate for w0. See Appendix B.

feature is that their sum is nearly 1.2, indicating "overspending"
during the first 2 years after receipt of a transfer payment.
The v coefficients for regular taxes also exhibit a characteristic
U-shape, but in much more muted fashion. As compared with factor
income, spending in the first year after a regular tax cut is apparently
substantially less, after which it catches up. This was surprising at first,
since Dolde (1976) and Modigliani and Steindel (1977) had suggested

that regular tax changes are "more permanent" than regular income.'8 However, it turns out that the following second-order alltoregressives describe the deviations from trend of personal income
(P1) and regular taxes (T1):
P1 = l.32P1_,
(.09)

T, =

Using the formulas derived earlier for permanent income, these
time-series models imply that "permanent personal income" and
"permanent taxes" are given byP' = 14.9P1 — 5.7P1_, and T' = 9.3T1
—

1.9T1_,, so that, contrary to Dolde and Modigliani and Steindel, we
should actually expect a stronger short-run response of consumption
to fluctuations in P1 than to fluctuations in T1, which is exactly what I
find.

The next column, the /3's, are in some sense out-of-sample extrapolations since there are no "pure windfalls" recorded in the
data.'9 Their only use is to form the weighted average )tw + (1 —
which

is reported in the column marked "y,." These are the ex-

penditure coefficients for income from a temporary tax that remains
on the books for the entire 2-year horizon. To illustrate the opposite

extreme, the column marked "Rebate" shows the spending
coefficients for a temporary tax that lasts only 1 quarter. These two
columns differ in details but are quite similar. There is a moderate

spending response in the initial quarter, followed by very little
spending over the next 3 or 4 quarters. Most of the spending out of a

temporary tax cut, according to these estimates, comes 5 or more
quarters after the cut.
The coefficient of assets (.02) is comparable to what others have
estimated, though a bit on the low side. A likelihood ratio test of the
null hypothesis k2 = 0 (which, in this constrained form, also implies k3

changes is stressed.

significant at any reasonable significance level (table 1, row 8).
If we ignore the fact that income from property is included in the

measure of income, the parameter k2 can be given an interesting
theoretical interpretation. In the basic life-cycle model, the consumer
maximizes a utility function of the form

subject to a lifetime wealth constraint. It can be shown by straightforward computations that the optimal solution for initial consumption is
C0 = [(r — g)/(1 + r)]W, where W is lifetime wealth and g is the optimal
growth rate of C,, defined asg =
+ r)/(1 + p)]' — 1. This means
thatk2 corresponds to the theoretical coefficient (r —g)/(1 + r), which
for small values of r and p is approximately equal to r + (lTh)(p — r).
Thus for small values of r the estimated valuek2 = .02 implies that the

percent per quarter for plausible values of &
One striking result, though it is peripheral to the subject of this
study, is the tiny coefficient of the real after-tax interest rate.2° This

finding turned up in every specification of the model, including
several alternative measures of the rate of interest. (Sometimes the
coefficient was trivially negative, sometimes trivially positive, but always trivial.) While it accords well both with my earlier work (Blinder

1975) and with the work of others, it stands in sharp contrast with
Boskin's (1978) recent finding of a strong positive interest elasticity of
saving.

2. Temporary versus Permanent Taxes

We can now address the principal issue of this study: How effective
are explicitly temporary income tax changes as compared to those
announced to be permanent? Table 4 contains the answers derived
from the model, using the parameter estimates presented in table 3 to
make equation (4) operational and using an annual real interest rate
of 3 percent in updating wealth according to equation (10). It can be
seen from column 4 that a temporary tax is about one-half as effective
as a permanent tax in the first year, rising to about three-quarters as

effective in the second year. Spending out of a rebate is somewhat
slower than this. My estimated cumulative spending propensities out

specific coefficient in table 3 means that a 1 percentage point rise in r lowers
savings by about .02 of 1 percent of disposable income—a trivial amount.

of a rebate are larger than those estimated by Modigliani and Steindel

(1977) for the first few quarters but smaller thereafter.
These findings carry two important messages to fiscal policy plan-

ners. First, and most obvious, is that temporary taxes are less powerful
devices for short-run stabilization purposes than are permanent ones.
Second, and perhaps almost as important, the short-run relative ineffectiveness of such taxes implies that the impact of these measures in

the second year is larger than might be expected. For example,
according to table 4, each $1.00 of permanent tax reduction adds
$0.25 to spending in the second year, while each $1.00 of a rebate
adds $0.45. If the need is for a truly short-run stimulus to aggregate
demand, this effect may also be unwanted.
Both of these points can be illustrated by examining what the
equations have to say about the 1975—76 episode. First, it is useful to

display the observed APCs for this period in table 5. There are two
obvious phenomena crying out for explanation in these data. First,
why did the APC drop so sharply in 1975:2? Second, why did it
thereafter begin a steady climb to what is a truly extraordinary level
by 1977:1? (The corresponding personal savings rate was only 4.2

percent—the lowest figure that had then been recorded since the

Korean War.)
According to the estimates presented in this paper, the temporary

tax cuts of 1975—76 contributed to both phenomena. Using the

spending coefficients presemed in table 4, table 6 shows the estimated
direct (excluding multiplier) effects on consumer spending of the tax
cuts of 1975:2 through 1976:2, inclusive.21 It appears that (1) very
little of the rebate was spent in 1975:2, (2) rather little of the disposable income attributable to the temporary tax cut package was spent

during the remainder of 1975, and (3) more spending out of the

temporary tax cuts was done in 1976 and yet more in 1977. Both the
low APC of 1975:2 and the high APCs of late 1976 and early 1977 are
tracked very well by the model. One observation which virtually
jumps from table 6 is how very small these estimated spending im-

pacts are relative to the size of the economy they were meant to
stimulate (real GNP in the neighborhood of $1,250 billion).
Finally, there is one more question. If, instead of the 1975:2—
1976:2 package of temporary measures, the government had cut
taxes "permanently" in 1975:2 and then restored theni to their origi-

nal level starting in 1976:3, how large a tax cut would have achieved
the same average effect on aggregate demand?22
Table 7 summarizes the model's answers to this question for three
different choices of the horizon over which the "average effect on
aggregate demand" might be defined. The first column gives the
average (lirect impact on spending attributed by the model to the

1975—76

5-quarter period (1975 : 2—1976 :2) in order to achieve the same direct

impact on spending through a permanent tax cut. Since the total
5-quarter revenue loss from the 1975—76 package was $20 billion,
these numbers mean, for example, that a permanent tax cut about
half as large ($9.5 billion vs. $20 billion) would have had the same
first-year effect on aggregate demand. Over a 2-year horizon, however, the 1975—76 package had about 80 percent as much "bang for
the buck" as a permanent tax cut.

VII. Summary
Both economic theory and casual empirical observation of the U.S.
economy suggest that short-run spending propensities from temporary tax changes are smaller than those from permanent ones, but
neither provides much guidance about the magnitude of this difference. This paper offers new empirical estimates of this difference and
finds it to be quite substantial.
The analysis is based on an amendment of the standard distributed
lag version of the PIH that distinguishes temporary taxes from other

income on the grounds that the latter is "more transitory." This
amendment, which is broadly consistent with rational expectations,
leads to a nonlinear consumption function.
Though the standard error is unavoidably large, the point estimate
suggests that a temporary tax change is treated as a 50-50 blend of a
normal income tax change and a pure windfall. Over a 1-year planning horizon, a temporary tax change is estimated to have only a little
more than half as much impact as a permanent tax change of equal
magnitude, and a rebate is estimated to have only about 38 percent as
much impact. The model tracks both the extraordinarily high savings
rate of 1975:2 and the extraordinarily low savings rates of late 1976
and early 1977 very well and attributes part of both phenomena to the
temporary tax measures of 1975—76. Finally, it is estimated that a

JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY

48

permanent tax cut of about $9.5 billion (in 1972 dollars) would have
had the same impact on aggregate demand over the first 4 quarters as
the $20 billion of 1975—76 tax cuts.

For purposes of reducing heteroscedasticity, the assumption was made that

Appendix C

Calculation of the Real After-Tax Interest Rate
The real after-tax interest rate is defined as ï, = i(l — r,) — 7T, where i is the
nominal interest rate, r, is the marginal tax rate, and 7T, is the expected rate of
inflation.
',TominaI interest rate. —Four different iiomiiial interest rates were tried: a
corporate bond rate, the 4—6 month commercial paper rate, the 3-month
Treasury bill rate, and a weighted average of rates received on various time
and savings accounts. While all four led to very similar results, the Treasury
bill rate gave the best fit and so was adopted.
Marginal tax rate. —The marginal tax rate was created from the average tax
rate in the following way. Let T(y) be the tax function facing an individual

TEMPORARY INCOME TAXES

taxpayer, and let 1(y)
the frequency distribution of income. The only
directly observable tax rate is the aggregate average rate, which is A =
be

[J 1'(y)f(y)dyj/Ifyf(y)dy].

Now suppose the whole income distribution shifts to the right with no

change in its shape; that is, it shifts from fly) toJly(I — h)J, where h connotes a

"small" multiplicative shift. The average income is then Y(h) = f)jTy(l —
/z)Id, so that, for small shifts (h near zero), dY/dh = — Jy2f(y)1y. Similarly,
average tax payments after the shift are T(/i) = I T(y)JIy(l — h)1d, so that
dT/dh = — 5yT(y)f'(y)dy. The aggregate marginal tax rate, M, is the ratio of

these: M fyT(y )f' (y )dy ]/fy2f (y )dj.

To evaluate these integrals and obtain a closed expression for MIA, I
adopted the following functional forms:

(h>l,a>0),

T(y)=ay5

f(y)=ye (y>O).

With these assumptions, the two ratios of integrals work out to be A =

ay2/'/)F(b + 1), M = (ay3I2y2)U(b + 2), where f(n) is the

"gamma
Function," namely, F(n + I) = nI'(n). Hence MIA = (b + 1)/2, and using a tax

elasticity of b = 1.6 gives M = (1.3)A.
The average tax rate was computed, quarter by quarter, by dividing the
sum of federal and state-local personal tax and nontax payments by personal
income excluding transfers (an approximation to the tax base). These are all
official national income accounts series.

Expected rate of inflation—Inflationary expectations were generated by a

model based on what has been called "economically rational" expectations.23
The idea is that agents, in informing themselves, begin with the data that are
cheapest per unit of informational content and then proceed to process more

costly data until the marginal cost and (expected) marginal benefits are
equated. In this particular application, I assumed that consumers base their
expectations of the inflation rate (P1) on its own past history and on the history
of the growth rate of the money supply (M,). Thus I estimated an equation

F, = a0 +

b,i1,_ + e,

on actual U.S. quarterly data, using the deflator for personal consumption
expenditures for P, and M2 for i'd,, and assumed that consumers used this
equation to generate expectations. In estimation, I used the Almon (1965) lag
technique with third-degree polynomials, no end-point constraints, and various choices for] and!. The best results were obtained with] = II and! = 17,

17 lagged values of Al.
