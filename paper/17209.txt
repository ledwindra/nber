ABSTRACT
Remittances of Continental Dollars to the national treasury from each state by year from 1779 through
1789 are used to determine state compliance with congressional resolutions regarding Continental-Dollar
redemption. From 1781 through 1789, the states as a whole stayed well ahead of the remittance schedule
set by Congress in 1779. Individual state compliance, however, varied considerably. By the time Congress
changed redemption requirements with the Funding Act of 4 August 1790, a majority of the net new
Continental Dollars ever emitted by Congress had already been redeemed by the states and remitted
to the national treasury to be burned.

State Redemption of the Continental Dollar, 1779-1790
By Farley Grubb*
Remittances of Continental Dollars to the national treasury from each state by year from
1779 through 1789 are used to determine state compliance with congressional resolutions
regarding Continental-Dollar redemption. From 1781 through 1789, the states as a whole
stayed well ahead of the remittance schedule set by Congress in 1779. Individual state
compliance, however, varied considerably. By the time Congress changed redemption
requirements with the Funding Act of 4 August 1790, a majority of the net new
Continental Dollars ever emitted by Congress had already been redeemed by the states
and remitted to the national treasury to be burned.

Congress financed the War for Independence by issuing paper money—the Continental
Dollar. From 1775 through 1779, net new emissions of Continental Dollars totaled almost $200
million (face value) and accounted for 77 percent of congressional spending. No new emissions
occurred after November 1779.1 Congress requested that the states remit on a set schedule
prescribed quotas of Continental Dollars to the national treasury to be burned. This permanent
removal of Continental Dollars from circulation comprised their final redemption by the
government. Congress left each state free to determine how best to redeem Continental Dollars
from its citizens, namely to determine which state taxes and fees could be paid in Continental
Dollars.2 The redemption and removal of Continental Dollars from circulation was necessary to
control their value and establish the soundness and credibility of Congress' war-financing
strategy. State compliance with congressional resolutions regarding the remittance of Continental
Dollars is documented here more clearly and comprehensively than has been done previously.3

1

The history of the Continental Dollar shaped the debates and decisions at the 1787
Constitutional Convention regarding how monetary powers would be changed in the new U.S.
Constitution. For example, on 16 August 1787 the Convention explicitly voted to remove the
power to emit paper money, i.e. the Continental Dollar, from the list of constitutional powers
granted to Congress—a power Congress had enjoyed under the Articles of Confederation and in
the draft constitutions at the Convention up to that point. The Convention, however, did not
recount the history of the Continental Dollar, its redemption, or any specifics about Congress'
paper-money policies. The delegates offered only general statements about "mischiefs" that
caused "disgust" with paper money.4 Sorting out the quantitative evidence on state compliance
with congressional resolutions regarding the redemption of Continental Dollars contributes to
our understanding of congressional finances and the role played by the Continental Dollar in
reshaping monetary powers in the early Republic.

.....
When Congress emitted Continental Dollars it also established procedures for their final
redemption and removal from circulation. For the first emission, the first three million—those
with the date May 10, 1775 printed on the bills, Congress passed remittance instructions on 29
July 1775.5 States were to remit set quotas of Continental Dollars to the Continental treasury to
be burned. Each state's quota was roughly proportional to each state's population share in the
union. Congress left each state free to decide how best to redeem Continental Dollars from the
citizens within its jurisdiction. For the first emission, state remittances to the Continental treasury
were to be in four equal installments spread over a contiguous four-year period, beginning on 30
November 1779 and ending on 30 November 1782. No state was required to remit more than its
quota. States with a deficient amount of Continental Dollars would make up the deficiency in

2

specie. Citizens with Continental Dollars in states that had already filled their quotas and had
ceased redeeming Continental Dollars could redeem their Continental Dollars at face value in
specie directly from the Continental treasury. They were claiming the specie remitted to the
Continental treasury by the states with a deficiency of Continental Dollars.6
For the second emission of Continental Dollars, the second three million—those with the
date November 29, 1775 printed on the bills, Congress passed remittance instructions on 26
December 1775. These instructions were identical to those issued on 29 July 1775 for the first
emission, except that the four equal installments spread over the contiguous four-year remittance
period were moved forward to begin after the last of the first emissions were remitted, namely to
begin on 30 November 1783 and end on 30 November 1786. For the next eight emissions,
totaling 95,500,300 Continental Dollars authorized—those with dates printed on the bills
beginning with February 17, 1776 and ending with September 26, 1778, no remittance
instructions were issued by Congress.7
The states, however, could deduce the pattern of required remittances on these eight
emissions from the remittance pattern set by Congress for the first two emissions. This pattern
set remittances far into the future, only beginning in late 1779 for the first bills emitted in 1775.
Extensive redemption could not occur until the war was over and taxable commerce had returned
to normal. In addition, this pattern established remittance intervals that were within feasible and
historically acceptable taxation levels, namely the amount of taxation that real production and
trade could bear during peacetime. Across the first two emissions, the redemption of just
$750,000 each year implied a tax rate per capita per year of $0.33. In the 13 colonies between
1770 and 1774, the average tax rate per white-capita per year was $0.41.8
Finally, the pattern set by Congress for remitting the first two emissions revealed a

3

forward-shifting contiguous four-year remittance period for each successive three million
emitted. This implied that future emissions would be redeemed successively further into the
future. This pattern maintained a feasible yearly taxation rate. In short, remittances would occur
only under feasible conditions. These feasible conditions included the war winding down enough
so that taxable commerce could return to normal and remittances spread out over time so that
taxation rates per capita per year could be maintained at feasible, historically acceptable, levels.
Congress' remittance instructions for the first two emissions were widely disseminated.
Sometime between 29 July and 25 October 1775, Congress printed and circulated a handbill that
contained Congress' resolutions regarding the Continental Dollar passed between 22 June and 29
July 1775, including all the remittance provisions discussed above.9 This handbill was reprinted,
in its entirety, in numerous newspapers—the first being in the Connecticut Journal, & NewHaven Post-Boy, 25 October 1775. Between 25 October and 4 December 1775 all three
newspapers in Connecticut, three of the four in Massachusetts, one of the two in Rhode Island,
one of the four in New York, and two of the five in Pennsylvania reprinted it. Out of the
surviving newspapers consulted, 10 of the 24 reprinted the handbill in its entirety.10 The
redemption procedures covering the second emission of Continental Dollars, passed by Congress
on 26 December 1775, were reprinted in The Pennsylvania Evening Post, Philadelphia, PA, on
12 March 1776. In addition, this information was disseminated when Congress published its
journal at the end of 1775.11 Between the direct circulation of the handbill, the reproduction of
said in the nation’s newspapers, publication of Congress' journal, and publication of
congressional resolutions in The Pennsylvania Evening Post, the public was well informed, with
the possible exception of citizens in the Southern colonies, of Congress' procedures for
redeeming and remitting the Continental Dollar.

4

On 2 January 1779 Congress changed state remittance requirements.12 All the structural
remittance procedures from 1775 were kept in place except the installment amounts and
contiguous-year remittance interval.13 In addition, all past and future emissions of Continental
Dollars were now lumped together to be treated equally. The states, in total, were now to remit
15 million in 1779 and an equal amount each year through 1797, the amount needed to exhaust
the remainder.14 While this resolution filled in the missing remittance instructions for the eight
preceding emissions, and provided remittance instructions for all future emissions, it also
replaced the explicit remittance instructions for the first two emissions passed by Congress on 29
July and 26 December 1775.
Congress set a $200 million limit for total net new emissions on 1 September 1779. They
reached this limit on 29 November 1779.15 Thus, by the end of 1779 the states, in total, were
now required to remit 10,277,778 Continental Dollars each year from 1780 through 1797 to the
Continental treasury to be burned. Eighteen years times 10,277,778 plus 15,000,000 for 1779
equaled 200 million Continental Dollars, i.e. the total for all net new emissions.16 The tax
implications of this change in remittance requirements placed it beyond what was feasible, or
historically acceptable, for the states if Continental Dollars were taken at face value. The tax rate
per capita per year for the 2 January 1779 remittance structure was $6.60 for 1779 and then
$4.52 for 1780 falling continuously to $2.63 by 1796 (due to population growth).
On 18 March 1780 Congress changed state remittance requirements again. States were to
remit 15 million Continental Dollars each month over the next 13 months. Thirteen months times
15 million equaled 195 million or 97.5 percent of all net new Continental Dollars ever emitted.
The remaining 5 million were presumably due from Georgia in the future, as she was temporarily
exempt from making remittances due to being invaded. The states were also allowed to substitute

5

one Spanish silver dollar in lieu of 40 Continental Dollars when filling their quotas. The 18
March 1780 resolution did not remove the option that citizens had to redeem their Continental
Dollars directly at the Continental treasury for their face value in specie as stated in the 29 July
and 26 December 1775 resolutions and as implied by the discussion in Congress on 14 June
1779.17 The tax implications of this change placed it well beyond what was feasible, or
historically acceptable, for the states. If Continental Dollars were taken at face value, the tax rate
per capita per year for this remittance structure would be $79.20 for 1780. If using the 40 to 1
depreciation rate, it would still be $1.98.18
On 20 March 1780 Congress recommended that states "revise their laws…making the
continental bills of credit a tender in discharge of debts and contracts, and to amend the same in
such manner as they shall judge most conducive to justice, in the present state of the paper
currency…" From late 1780 through mid-1781 the states complied by revoking their laws
making the Continental Dollar a legal tender in their respective states. For example, Delaware
passed its law revoking the legal-tender status of the Continental Dollar on 8 November 1780;
New Jersey on 5 January 1781; Virginia on 5 May 1781; and Pennsylvania made its temporary
suspension of legal-tender status permanent on 21 June 1781. By all accounts, Continental
Dollars ceased to circulate as a currency in May of 1781.19 Throughout the rest of the 1780s,
Congress frequently indicated that the Continental Dollar would be redeemed at or near face
value, or at historic market value, in the near future. No definitive plan, however, was made or
action taken.20
Congress' Continental-Dollar remittance requirements were never rescinded in the 1780s.
They were only superseded by the Funding Act of 4 August 1790. From 1779 to 1790, the states
were expected to redeem and remit Continental Dollars, or their specie equivalent as determined

6

by Congress, to the Continental treasury to be burned.21 Did the states comply and, if so, which
of the several remittance resolutions did they follow?

.....
Three documents report remittances of Continental Dollars from each state to the
Continental treasury by year. They span from 1779 through 1789. These documents report final
redemption remittances, as the Continental Dollars received were burned rather than re-spent.
Cross-corroboration of the three documents is required to establish a comprehensive listing and
consistent interpretation of the remittances recorded. Close attention to whether gross or net
emissions are being counted is also needed to make sense of this evidence.
On 14 January 1786 Joseph Nourse, the Registrar of the Treasury from 1781 to 1829,
reported to Congress the amount of Continental Dollars—face value—paid into the Continental
treasury from May 1779 through 1785 by month, year, and source.22 In May of 1782 the
Continental Treasurer, Michael Hillegas, reported to state governors a portion of the report given
by Nourse to Congress in 1786—the portion covering from 25 November 1780 through 23
February 1782.23 Hillegas' report is identical to Nourse's report for the period that the two
overlap except that Hillegas identifies which of the remittances were just currency swaps, i.e.
those affecting gross but not net emissions.24 Finally, on 11 May 1790 Alexander Hamilton,
Secretary of the Treasury, reported to Congress the amount of Continental Dollars—face value—
paid into the Continental treasury from November 1780 through March 1789 by day, month,
year, and state.25 With the exception of a few minor omissions and discrepancies noted below,
the three reports are the same for the periods when they overlap. This cross-corroboration gives
confidence to the numbers reported by each series when they do not overlap.

7

These series, slightly rearranged (put into chronological order), are reproduced in Table
1. The numbers in the Hillegas report, being redundant, are not listed separately.26 Combining
the three series gives a continuous quantitative monthly series from May 1779 through March
1789 of the amount of Continental Dollars—face value—remitted by each state to the
Continental treasury. Eliminating the overlap or duplication between the series yields a total of
$153.5 million Continental Dollars—face value—remitted to the Continental treasury and
burned by 1790. Interpreting this number, however, requires additional scrutiny.
[Place Table 1 Here]
The Hillegas report identifies the purpose of each remittance, something not done in the
Nourse and Hamilton reports. In particular, Hillegas identifies which remittances from the 20
May 1777 and 11 April 1778 emissions were being swapped dollar-for-dollar for the emission of
14 January 1779.27 Comparing the entries in the Hillegas report with those in the Nourse and
Hamilton reports for the period when the three reports overlap indicates that the Nourse report
includes the remittance of Continental Dollars that were part of this currency swap, whereas the
Hamilton report deliberately excludes these remittances, see Table 1. As such, the Nourse and
Hillegas reports are counting remittances in reference to gross emissions or total printings of
Continental Dollars ($241,500,000) whereas the Hamilton report is counting remittances in
reference to net new emissions ($199,990,000).28 By inference, the numbers in the Nourse report
for the period before Hamilton’s report commences must represent only remittances that were
part of the currency swap and so are not a reduction in net new emissions.
This interpretation of how to count remittances is consistent with the timing of
congressional legislation. The period over which bills from the 20 May 1777 and 11 April 1778
emissions could be exchanged for bills of the 14 January 1779 emission ran from the spring of

8

1779 through 1 January 1781. While most of the currency swap took place before that deadline,
some of the exchanged bills continued to trickle into the treasury through 1781. The total sums
that were eligible for exchange were $41.5 million. Nourse's remittances through 1 January 1781
totaled $34.4 million and through April of 1781 totaled $39.9 million. That total rises to $41
million when the amounts that Hillegas explicitly identifies as being exchanges of the 20 May
1777 and 11 April 1778 emissions that took place after April 1781 are added. The closeness of
this total to $41.5 million, given that Nourse admits that his numbers are neither comprehensive
nor complete, is further indication that Nourse's numbers, at least into late 1780, include mostly
the return of old Continental bills that were being swapped for new Continental bills and not a
reduction in the net amount of Continental Dollars outstanding.29
The requisition act of 18 March 1780, with its "Continental-State" Dollar scheme,
induced the first serious effort by the states to remit Continental Dollars—a net removal of
Continental Dollars from circulation rather than just the currency swaps discussed above. Under
this scheme states removed between $31.8 and $41.4 million Continental Dollars from the public
and remitted them to the Continental treasury between late 1780 and late 1781. The estimated
range comes from conflicting statements over how many Continental-State Dollars were issued
by the various states under this scheme. For every 20 Continental Dollars remitted to the
Continental treasury to be burned, a state was allowed to emit on its own account one
Continental-State Dollar. The Continental-State Dollar experiment collapsed by mid-1781 and
was never revived.30
Remittances of Continental Dollars under the Continental-State Dollar scheme would not
begin to roll into the Continental treasury until late in 1780, which is consistent with the
commencement date (November 1780) of the Hamilton report. The last to roll into the

9

Continental treasury under this scheme, given its mid-1781 collapse, would be mid-to-late 1781.
Hamilton's total, starting in November of 1780, reaches these amounts ($31.8 and $41.4 million
Continental Dollars) by August and November 1781, respectively, see Table 1.
From July 1780 through 1781, Continental Dollars were remitted to the Continental
treasury both as part of the Continental-State currency scheme and as part of the currency swap
of the emissions of 20 May 1777 and 11 April 1778 for the emission of 14 January 1779. The
evidence does not always distinguish the reason for each specific remittance. The Hamilton
report, which does not start until November 1780, is thought to exclude the currency swaps,
whereas the Nourse report which starts in May 1779 is thought to include the currency swaps. By
November 1781, total remittances across the entirety of both the Nourse and the Hamilton
reports, sans overlap and duplication, were enough to fully account both for the $41.5 million
currency swap and the upper estimate of $41.1 million remitted under the Continental-State
currency scheme.
The sums remitted after 1781 were part of the normal quotas being filled by the states.
Interestingly, both Nourse and Hamilton indicate that no Continental Dollars were remitted to the
Continental treasury between late 1783 and mid-1786. Apparently, once the revolution was over
and independence was officially recognized with the Treaty of Paris (end of 1783), states saw no
need to continue remitting Continental Dollars. Only when it became clear that there would be a
reckoning of accounts between the states and the national government did remittances of
Continental Dollars pick up again—presumably as states positioned themselves for credits with
the national government.31
For example, Thomas Jefferson, writing to James Madison from Annapolis on 25 April
1784, reasoned, "Would it not be well for Virginia to empower persons privately to buy up her

10

quota of old Continental money. I would certainly advise this were I not afraid that possession of
her quota on such easy terms would tempt her to refuse justice to the other states on this
matter.… If she would…do what is right, I should much wish to see her adopt secret measures
for the purchase. I think some states will do this, and I fear with unjust views."32
By 1790 the total amount of Continental Dollars (face value) still unremitted was $80.5
million ($200 million of net new emission minus $119.5 million remitted through 1789 as
reported by Hamilton) or $88 million ($241.5 million of gross emissions minus $153.5 million of
gross remittances as the result of combining the Hamilton and Nourse reports), see Table 1.
Because Nourse admitted that his numbers were not complete, the $80.5 million will be taken as
the better estimate. Thus by 1790, 11 years after ceasing to issue Continental Dollars and seven
years after the end of the revolution, the states had managed to remove from the public roughly
60 percent of the net new Continental Dollars ever emitted ($119.5 million / $200 million). This
was quite an accomplishment—a success seldom noted in the literature—especially considering
that 1784 through 1787 were depression years for the U.S. economy and that Congress' 2 January
1779 resolution did not require states to complete their remittances of Continental Dollars until
1797.33
The $80.5 million Continental Dollars estimated above that were still unremitted in 1790
is corroborated by other evidence. It is close to the guess made by the 28th Congress that $78 to
$80 million remained unredeemed and unfunded as of 1791, and it is close to Hamilton's implied
estimate for 1789. Hamilton placed the national debt at $77,124,465 for 1789/1790. In this
number Hamilton included $2 million Continental Dollars which he calculated at its specie value
of 40 Continental Dollars to one specie dollar as set by Congress on 18 March 1780 for crediting
state remittances—$80,527,631 Continental Dollars outstanding in 1790 in face value converts

11

to $2,013,191 in specie value at that rate.34
Congress adopted the new U.S. Constitution in 1789 and under its auspices restructured
its finances with the Funding Act of 4 August 1790. This act set 100 Continental Dollars being
exchangeable for one dollar in Federal Government interest-bearing bonds. It also, for the first
time, made the default on the Continental Dollar vis-à-vis the public irrevocably permanent.
Dollars not swapped for bonds under this plan would thereafter be worthless. The bonds were
callable perpetuities that paid 6 percent annual interest, but with one-third paying no interest
until 1800. Only $6 million were so exchanged between 1791 and 1797—when the exchange
program was ended.35 Thus, by 1797 $125.5 million of the $200 million net new Continental
Dollars ever emitted (63 percent) can be accounted for as remittances to the national treasury.
What happened to the rest? Some were likely lost or destroyed.36 Judging by the
numerous petitions sent to Congress and the Secretaries of the Treasury after 1790, most were
held by citizens hoping for a better redemption rate than the 100 to 1 rate set by the 1790
Funding Act. They were disappointed. Redemption ceased at the end of 1797 and the
government would give nothing for Continental Dollars thereafter. In 1843, the 28th Congress,
when investigating what happened to the Continental Dollar, concluded that $72 to $74 million
(face value) had been a total loss to the public, never funded or redeemed.37

.....
The quantitative time path of emissions and remittances of Continental Dollars from 1775
to 1790 is presented in Figure 1 as the cumulative net total still outstanding by year (face value).
Emissions began in June of 1775 and ended in November of 1779. They totaled $199,990,000
net new emissions. All were still outstanding as of 1780. Congress printed an additional
$41,510,000 to be swapped one-for-one with already emitted Continental Dollars, replacing

12

existing Continental Dollars that were either too torn or ragged to continue in circulation or were
under threat of being counterfeited. Most of these currency swaps took place between 1779 and
1781. Adding the $41,510,000 issued for currency exchange to the $199,990,000 net new
emissions yields $241,500,000 in gross emissions or total printings of Continental Dollars.38
Separating gross from net emissions is necessary for evaluating the evidence on remittances.
Remittances to reduce net new emissions were to begin in 1779. Yet no remittances for
that purpose were made in 1779, and only $1,302,387 for that purpose was made in 1780. In
1779, remittances for currency swaps only were made, and most of the remittances made in 1780
were for currency swaps as well. Before 1779, the states were expecting to remit, in total, only
750,000 Continental Dollars in 1779, and the same amount again in 1780, toward the reduction
of net new emissions. By the end of 1780, the states as a whole were close to being on target
with that pre-1779 remittance expectation, $1,500,000 expected versus $1,302,387 actually
made.
The change in remittance requirements made by Congress on 2 January 1779, to a total of
$15 million for 1779 and $10,277,778 for 1780, may have caught the states unprepared for such
an unexpectedly large increase in remittances. It was also unachievable tax-wise at face value.
The war was not over and taxable commerce had not returned to normal levels. The tax rate
needed to raise such a sum was well outside feasible and historically acceptable limits. Yet,
between 1781 and 1782, total remittances for the purpose of reducing net new emissions
accelerated, surpassing the level needed to adhere to the remittance schedule set by Congress on
2 January 1779. While remittances stayed ahead of this schedule from 1781 through 1790, after
1785 they tracked it closely, see Figure 1.
After 1780, the states as a whole appear to have adhered to the remittance schedule set by

Congress on 2 January 1779, and largely ignored the new remittance schedule set by Congress
on 18 March 1780. This 1780 schedule changed remittances to $15 million per month through
April 1781, for a total of $195 million remitted by that date. In fact, a mere $7.3 million were
remitted by that date, and only another $47.7 million were remitted through the rest of 1781.
How the states were able to meet the remittance schedule that they actually did is unclear
and a topic for future research. The methods for redeeming Continental Dollars were left to the

14

individual states. They likely varied considerably from state to state. One thing is clear: to meet
the remittance schedule that the states actually met, either tax rates per capita per year, especially
in 1781 and 1782, had to be well above what had been historically acceptable, and/or states had
to acquire Continental Dollars from their citizens at significant discounts off their face value. For
example, 1781 and 1782 were the two years with the most remittances, 53,690,923 and
24,506,561 Continental Dollars, in face value, respectively. The per capita per year tax rates
needed to raise these two sums were 57.6 and 26.3 times higher than the average per (white)
capita per year tax rate of $0.41 in the colonies for all taxes levied between 1770 and 1774.
Alternatively, to hold the average per capita per year tax rate at $0.41 solely for acquiring the
Continental Dollars that were redeemed and remitted would entail acquiring Continental Dollars
at considerably depreciated rates, namely 57.6 Continental Dollars equal to $1 in specie for
1781, and 26.3 Continental Dollars equal to $1 in specie for 1782. Some combination of higher
tax rates and depreciated acquisitions were likely used, with considerable variation across the
states.
Removal of the Continental Dollar's legal tender status by the states in 1780-1, at the
suggestion of Congress, may have been necessary for the states to meet such large remittance
requirements. Adhering to the remittance schedules passed by Congress after 1778, and the
actual remittances observed after 1780, forced these outcomes, namely the removal of the
Continental Dollar's legal tender status, steep discounts given when paying taxes in anything
other than Continental Dollars, and excessively high tax rates by historical standards.

.....
Broadly interpreted, after 1780 the states as a whole appear to have adhered to the
remittance schedule set by Congress on 2 January 1779, see Figure 1. However, some states ran

15

well ahead of that schedule, while others lagged far behind. Only on average was that schedule
of remittances the one to which the states appear to have adhered. Table 2 and Figure 2 illustrate
the variation in remittance-compliance among the states. Table 2 tracks the remittance
requirements (quotas) per year for each state as established by Congress on 2 January 1779. It
calculates the percentage of these yearly quotas each state had filled as well as the percentage
each state had filled of its accumulated yearly quotas to that date. The last columns in Table 2
provide a yearly summary of the remittance information in Table 1. Figure 2 combines the
information in Table 2 with Hamilton's evidence in Table 1 to chart the progress each state had
made toward filling its entire assigned quota of remittances of Continental Dollars.
[Place Table 2 Here]
Delaware was the first to completely fill its entire quota, doing so with a single payment
on 7 January 1782, see Figure 2. Massachusetts and New Hampshire also quickly filled their
entire quotas, completing their payments by late September 1782. After that only Rhode Island,
with a single payment on 13 August 1787, completely filled its entire quota. Pennsylvania
reached 90 percent of its entire quota by 1783, and New York reached 80 percent in 1786. New
Jersey reached just over 50 percent by 1783 but made little progress thereafter. The other states,
with the exception of South Carolina and Georgia who recorded no remittances in the 1780s,
made slow and intermittent progress but never reached over 50 percent of their total assigned
quotas. The behavior of New York, Virginia, Rhode Island, and Maryland after 1785 is
consistent with Jefferson’s rationale (quoted above) for how states reacted to positioning
themselves for credits with the national government, given the pending reckoning of accounts
between the states and the national government over apportioning war debts. No state is recorded
as having remitted more than its total assigned quota of Continental Dollars.

Fig. 2 Progress in Total Quota Fulfillment by State in
Remitting Continental Dollars, 1780-9
Sources: Tables 1 and 2.
Notes: See the text for construction. Square markers indicate that only a single payment
was observed for that state. Lines start at the first payment remitted for each state, respectively,
and chart the cumulative progress in fulfilling that state's total assigned quota. The two-month
unit interval counts January with February, March with April, and so on.

In the early 1780s, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and
Delaware were far ahead; New York and Virginia were somewhat behind; and the rest of the
states were way behind the remittance schedule set by Congress on 2 January 1779, see Table 2.
If we consider remittances just through the end of 1782, it appears that some states were more
closely adhering to the remittance schedule set by Congress on 18 March 1780. This schedule

17

asked each state to remit its entire quota (last row in Table 2) by mid-1781. By the end of 1782,
New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and Delaware had completely filled, Pennsylvania had filled 91
percent, and New Jersey had filled 54 percent, of their entire quotas, see Figure 2. By contrast,
through 1782, Virginia and New York appear to have been trying to adhere to the 2 January 1779
remittance schedule. The rest of the states were ignoring remittance requests.
The extreme variation in remittances across the states implies that the per capita per year
tax rates, and/or the acquisition of Continental Dollars at depreciated rates, that was necessary to
achieve the remittance amounts observed were in some states accentuated well above, and in
other states depressed well below, the average calculated above for all states as a whole. To what
extent this extreme state-level variation caused confusion and conflict among the states regarding
the remittances of Continental Dollars is unclear and a topic for future research.39

.....
The history of the Continental Dollar influenced debate over monetary powers at the
1787 Constitutional Convention. That history, which previously has been murky regarding what
happened after 1779, is more firmly established here. Allowing Congress to emit paper money
may have been "the mark of the beast in Revelations" as George Read put it at the Constitutional
Convention.40 But it was not because of a failure of the states, as a whole, to comply with
congressional resolutions, particularly those made before 1780, regarding the Continental
Dollar's redemption, remittance, and removal from circulation. After 1778, the unexpected,
frequent, and unfeasible changes which Congress made in the remittance schedule likely created
confusion, compliance variation, and conflict among the states regarding redeeming the
Continental Dollar.

Sources: Derived from Joseph Nourse, Registrar's Office, Board of Treasury, 14 January
1786 report as recorded in the JCC (30: 22-5); and Alexander Hamilton's 11 May 1790 report to
Congress (American State Papers 1832, Class III, Finance, 1: 58-9; Elliot 1843, 73-6; United
States Congress 1834, 2: 1544, 1566) "Schedule E. Statement of the sums, in the old continental
emissions, paid by the following States into the treasury of the United States, on account of their

27

several quotas of the requisitions of Congress, of March 18, 1780." Both sources record no
payments made by Georgia and South Carolina, and no payments made for the years 1784 and
1785.
Notes:
* Identified by Michael Hillegas, Continental Treasurer, in May of 1782 as being bills of
the 20 May 1777 and 11 April 1778 emissions remitted as part of the authorized currency
exchange for new bills that occurred between 25 November 1780 and 23 February 1782
(Ferguson, et al., 1980, 5: 139).

These appear to be the same entry. Which is correct and which is a typo is unclear.
b
These appear to be the same entry. Which is correct and which is a typo is unclear.
c
These might be the same entry, though that is not entirely clear. If they are, which is
correct and which is a typo is not clear. For the purpose of calculating the "Grand Combined
Total (sans overlap)" they were counted as independent and separate entries.
d
Nourse indicated that his numbers were neither comprehensive nor complete. As such
they represent a lower bound of what was actually removed and destroyed in this period.
e
Because the number in note d above is a lower bound, this value is biased high.

Notes: The congressional resolution of 2 January 1779 established remittance amounts
through 1797. The 4 August 1790 Funding Act, however, removed state remittance obligations.
The horizontal line drawn between 1790 and 1791 is a reminder that state remittance obligations
33

became non-operative after 1790.
a
The percentage in brackets by each state is the quota assigned on 7 October 1779 when
Georgia was exempt due to being invaded. Georgia, however, was required to eventually raise
"its proportion." See JCC (15: 1150). The percentage used in the calculation, the un-bracketed
percentage by each state, assumes that Georgia was eventually assigned $5 million out of the
total of $200 emitted as its share to remit. The percentage distribution was then recalculated
among the states. The $5 million for Georgia comes from the residual between the amount
emitted ($200 million) and the amount assigned to be remitted to all the other states except
Georgia ($195 million) in 1781. See the accounting as stated by Charles Thomson, Secretary of
Congress, on 28 June 1781 in Ferguson, et al. (1973, 1: 194).
b
Congress thought it had issued a total of $200 million in net new emissions when in fact
it had only issued $199,990,000. See Grubb (2008a). No adjustment is made here for this
discrepancy.

In 1866, Henry Phillips (1866, v) concluded that, "the history of the notes [Continental

Dollars] and the reasons why they were not fully liquidated [redeemed by the states], have been
but imperfectly known." Our knowledge has improved little since. Most discussions of the topic,
both in the classic and in the modern literature, are cursory at best. For example, a
comprehensive documentation and discussion of state redemption of Continental Dollars does
not appears in Baack (2008), Bolles (1969), Breck (1843), Bronson (1865); Brown (1993),

Congress also asked the states to remit Continental Dollars to Congress as loans that

Congress could then re-spend: a 5 million Continental Dollar loan requested on 22 November
1777, a 45 million loan requested on 21 May 1779, and a 135 million loan requested on 6-7
October 1779. States received a credit for the principal loaned plus 6 percent interest per annum
accruing on the amount loaned. These were not remittances of Continental Dollars for the
purpose of their final redemption and removal from circulation. The states were still required
ultimately to redeem these re-spent Continental Dollars and cause them to be permanently
removed from circulation by remitting them under the procedures that led to their being burned
at the Continental treasury. As such, these loan remittances are not considered here as they were

37

not final redemption remittances. In addition, the amounts the states remitted as loans are not
clear. Little compliance to these loan requests can be found. The states may have ignored them
because the per capita per year tax rates needed to comply with these loan requests in
Continental Dollars at their face value, between $2.2 and $79.2, were many times higher than
what had been historically feasible. The lack of state compliance with these loan requests is also
implied by the language used in the remittance request made on 18 March 1780. JCC (8: 650,
731; 9: 953-8; 14: 626; 15: 1147-50; 16: 263).
13

The specie redemption option for citizens at the Continental treasury stated in the

remittance procedures for the first two emissions was not mention in the 2 January 1779
resolution. However, it was implied as being still operative in the preamble to a discussion on
finances on 14 June 1779. Therein it was said, "In consequence [to the discontinuance of
emission of new bills]...it may be expected that the currency will gradually appreciate until the
time limited for its redemption, when possessors will be entitled to receive the amount expressed
in each bill in gold and silver." JCC (14: 728).

JCC (13: 20-1). The 2 and 14 January 1779 congressional resolutions on paper money

were made quickly available to the public. For example, they were reprinted in their entirety on
the front page of the Pennsylvania Gazette, Philadelphia, PA on 27 January 1779.

The 2 and 14 January 1779 congressional resolutions restructuring the remittance of

the Continental Dollar also entailed a currency swap. The entire emissions of 20 May 1777 and
11 April 1778, totaling 41,500,000 Continental Dollars, were to be exchanged one-for-one for
new bills, those with the date January 14, 1779 on them. The emissions of 20 May 1777 and 11
April 1778 were under threat of being counterfeited. The currency swap was to remedy the

38

counterfeiting problem. Remittances of Continental Dollars by the states to the Continental
treasury for the purpose of this currency exchange need to be distinguished from remittances that
were intended to remove Continental Dollars permanently from circulation. Grubb (2008a); JCC
(13: 20-2, 64-5).

made public on the front page of the Pennsylvania Gazette, Philadelphia, PA on 29 March 1780.
18

The 18 March 1780 resolution also allowed states, but did not require them, to issue

one "Continental-State" Dollar on their own account for every 20 Continental Dollars remitted to
the Continental treasury to be burned. Continental-State Dollars were state-specific paper monies
and not financial obligations of the national government. Each state that issued their own
Continental-State Dollars was also required to give 4/10ths of its issue to the national
government for the national government to spend as it pleased. Each state, however, was still
financially obligated to redeem the 4/10ths that it had given to the national government. The
Continental-State Dollar experiment collapsed by mid-1781 and was never revived. American

The only major exception in the cross-corroboration is the May 1781 amount for

Virginia ($5,785,555) which is missing from the Hillegas report. As such, the numbers in the
Hillegas report are not listed separately in Table 1 since they are both redundant and incomplete
relative to the Nourse report.

28

See note 16; Grubb (2008a). This conclusion is consistent with what Nourse (1828)

reported to the 20th Congress as total emissions. Therein he included the full authorization of 14
January 1779 ($50 million) without netting out bills swapped for the bills of the 20 May 1777
and 11 April 1778 emissions.
29

Grubb (2008a). Francis Hopkinson, treasure of loans, reported the cumulative total

amounts of the emissions of 20 May 1777 and 11 April 1778 that had been received and
destroyed, namely those that had been swapped for new bills, as being $3,852,766 by 19 July

40

1779, $19,847,268 by 1 January 1780, and $32,304,372 by 22 March 1780 (Pennsylvania
Gazette, Philadelphia, PA on 28 July 1779, 12 January 1780, and 29 March 1780, respectively).
Hopkinson's totals fully account for Nourse's remittance totals in Table 1 to those dates,
respectively. Nourse's totals to the end of March 1780 are $710,441 below Hopkinson's totals as
of 22 March 1780.
30

See note 18. The total Continental-State Dollars issued across the states in 1780 and

1781 were reported to Congress in 1790 by the Registrar of the Treasury, Joseph Nourse, to be
$2,070,485. Alexander Hamilton, Secretary of the Treasury, reported a different total to
Congress on 11 May 1790, namely $1,592,222 for the same period. If these numbers are correct,
then during 1780 and 1781 a total of either $41,409,700 or $31,844,440 Continental Dollars were
called out of circulation via this mechanism—given the 20 to 1 rate allowed in Congress'
requisition act of 18 March 1780. American State Papers (1832, Class III, Finance, 1: 58);
Archives of Maryland (48: 22); Elliot (1843, 11, 65-83); Nourse (1999, 9: 930-6); Syrett (1962,
6: 412-4); United States Congress (1834, 2: 1544, 1566). See also American Almanac (1830,
183); Ferguson (1961, 30); Gouge (1833, 2: 25); Hepburn (1967, 16); and Perkins (1994, 97).
Elliot (1843, 11) also reported estimates by Senator Woodbury, former Secretary of the Treasury,
of $2,070,240 and $2,071,085 total Continental-State Dollars emitted. By contrast, Ratchford
(1941, 38) said that "$4,468,625 of these new bills [Continental-State Dollars] were put into
circulation" citing Harlow (1929, 62). However, Harlow (1929, 62) really said, "Less than half
the authorized total—about $4,468,625—was put into circulation…" Half of $4,468,625 is
$2,234,313, which is almost the total given by Elliot (1843, 11); Gouge (1833, 2: 25); and
Hepburn (1967, 16). Unfortunately, Harlow cited JCC (19: 399-400) [15 April 1781] as his
source. It turns out there is no entry in the JCC for 15 April 1781—it was a Sunday and Congress

41

did not meet—and none of Harlow’s numbers are mentioned on the pages he cited. For another
possible source of this $4,468,625 number see Bronson (1865, 125) and Bullock (1895, 138;
1900, 72). Bronson (1865, 126) estimated the total emissions of Continental-State Dollars to be
$3,980,556. He arrived at this total by taking the number reported by Hamilton and assuming this
was only the Federal Government's share, i.e. four-tenths of the total emitted. Scaling up from
four-tenths yielded $3,980,556 for the total emission of Continental-State Dollars. This also
seems to be the source of Bullock's estimate of $4 million Continental-State Dollars issued.
Hamilton's statement is somewhat ambiguous as to whether the reported sum is the global total
or just the Federal Government's four-tenths share. However, the $80 million Continental Dollars
that would have had to have been called out of circulation by the states in 1780 and 1781, given
the 20 to 1 rate set by Congress, to be consistent with the $4 million Continental-State Dollars
these authors say were emitted cannot be sustained by the direct evidence or made consistent
with the other evidence these authors present, see Table 1 and Grubb (2008a). The confusion can
be straightened out by the report sent to Robert Morris by Charles Thomson, the Secretary of
Congress, on 29 June 1781 (Ferguson, et al., 1973, 1: 193-4). Thomson reported $195 million
Continental Dollars outstanding, which if all were cashed in for Continental-State Dollars would
yield $9.75 million Continental-State Dollars of which Congress would get four-tenths or $3.9
million Continental-State Dollars. As such the $4 million is the maximum amount possible that
Congress could acquire (200,000,000 * 0.05 * 0.4 = 4,000,000) of Continental-State Dollars and
not what it did acquire. As such, Bronson, Bullock, and Ratchford may have simply confused the
maximum amount possible that Congress could have gotten for the actual amount of
Continental-State Dollars emitted by the states.

Sumner (1968, 1: 98); Syrett (1962, 6: 85-7); United States Congress (1834, 2: 2243-

often to have been either misinterpreted or ignored in the secondary literature, see notes 3, 30,
35, and 37.
35

Elliot (1843, 12); Newman (1997, 69); Sumner (1968, 1: 980); United States Congress

(1834, 2: 2243-51). Ferguson (1961, 67) says in regard to the mass of Continental Dollars issued
and outstanding prior to the 1790 Funding Act, "Eventually the dead mass of currency was
drawn in by the states. A good part of it was scattered or destroyed, and in 1790 only about
$6,000,000 remained in the hands of individuals." Ferguson's source for his $6 million number is
Elliot (1843, 12). Ferguson misinterpreted his source. The $6 million was the number estimated
to have been actually exchanged at the 100 to 1 rate for bonds after 1790, not the amount
outstanding at this date in the hands of the public, which was estimated to be $78 to $80 million
in the same source. In addition, in reference to 1780 and the withdrawal of old Continental
currency, Ferguson (1961, 181) says that the "states absorbed nearly $120,000,000." Ferguson's
statement here also appears to be the source of the statement by Perkins (1994, 97) that "They
[the states] collected monies [continental currency] with a face value of $119 million ($3 million
in specie) in the early 1780s, approximately half the total volume issued by Congress." These
two statements are erroneous. No other sources show that much absorbed in 1780 or in the early
1780s. If by chance Ferguson and Perkins really meant that the total absorbed by the states
between 1780 and 1790 was $120 million, then they would be close to that estimated here in
Table 1 and to the evidence in Ferguson's primary source (Elliot, 1843, 12, item #3).

See the stories recounted in Breck (1843, 15-6); Ferguson (1961, 66); Phillips (1866,

185). A common image offered today is that worthless Continental Dollars were smoked in pipes
(or used to light smoking pipes). So far, I have not been able to find any actual reference to said
from this era. This image may be a latter day myth based on a statement taken from a poem
about Maryland paper money in the 1730s—the only American reference to using paper money
to light smoking pipes that I have found. See Cooke (1730, 8).
