Australian Government Balance Sheet Management

NBER Working Paper No. 12302
June 2006
JEL No. H5, H6
ABSTRACT
Since almost eliminating net debt, the Australian Government’s attention has turned to the
financing of broader balance sheet liabilities, such as public sector superannuation. Australia will
be developing a significant financial asset portfolio in the ‘Future Fund’ to smooth the financing of
expenses through time. This raises the significant policy question of how best to manage the
government balance sheet to reduce risk.
This paper provides a framework for optimal balance sheet management. The major
conclusions are that:
– fiscal sustainability depends on both the expected path of future taxation and the risks around that
path;
– optimal balance sheet management requires knowledge of how risks affect the balance sheet (and
therefore volatility in tax rates); and
– the government’s financial investment strategy should reduce the risk to government finances from
macroeconomic shocks that permanently affect the budget.
Based on this framework, we find that a Future Fund portfolio that included (amongst other
potential investments) domestic nominal securities and equities of selected countries would reduce
overall balance sheet risk.

AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT
Wilson Au-Yeung, Jason McDonald and Amanda Sayegh

1. INTRODUCTION
The Australian Government has taken steps over the past decade to improve the sustainability of
government finances. In particular, the Government has significantly reduced its debt liabilities,
avoiding many of the risks associated with high debt levels.
Having achieved a low level of debt, the Government’s attention has turned to the financing of
broader balance sheet liabilities, such as superannuation obligations to its employees. The
Government has announced that it will establish a Future Fund to finance public sector
superannuation liabilities. 1 This will assist in relieving future generations of some of the
financing burden associated with other intergenerational fiscal pressures which are expected to
emerge over the medium term.
The creation of the Future Fund raises the significant policy question of how best to structure
the Government’s balance sheet to reduce overall financial risk. This paper sets out a
framework for optimal government balance sheet management and presents some preliminary
estimates of the types of financial assets and liabilities that would reduce overall financial risk.2

These liabilities relate to public sector employees only, not broader social insurance obligations found in
many OECD countries.
The paper does not discuss the appropriate size of government expenditure, the level or composition of
taxation necessary to fund it or the optimal size of a net asset portfolio (Future Fund) through time.

2. THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT BALANCE SHEET
The Australian Government’s Charter of Budget Honesty Act 1998 (the Charter) highlights the
need for governments to manage balance sheet risks. The purpose of the Charter is to improve
fiscal policy outcomes by requiring the fiscal strategy to be based on principles of sound fiscal
management and by facilitating public scrutiny of fiscal policy and performance.
The Charter facilitates optimal balance sheet management in two ways. First, the Charter
requires governments to make regular financial reports that comply with external reporting
standards, including the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Government Finance Statistics
(GFS) and Australian Accounting Standards (AAS). This means the government balance sheet
is comparable across entities and jurisdictions. Second, the Charter requires the ‘prudent’
management of financial risks, including those relating to the broader government balance sheet
(such as risks relating to the tax base). By requiring transparent presentation of the balance
sheet and effective management of financial risks, the Charter allows the community to hold the
government accountable for its financial performance.
2.1 The balance sheet
The Australian Government general government sector has published a balance sheet in the
budget papers since 1999-2000 consistent with international reporting standards. 3 The balance
sheet reported in the 2003-04 Final Budget Outlook is reproduced below.

3

The Charter requires a balance sheet to be published as part of the budget papers (usually produced in May),
the mid-year economic and fiscal outlook (by the end of January in each year, or within six months after the
last budget, whichever is later) and at the final budget outcome (up to 3 months after the end of the financial
year). The Charter requires the balance sheet to be on both the ABS GFS and AAS basis. However, the
primary budget statements (and therefore all references in this paper) are on a GFS basis.

The major assets on the Government’s balance sheet are: financial equity, mainly reflecting the
government’s remaining share in Australia’s major telecommunication company Telstra
($50 billion); non-equity assets, mainly taxes owed but not yet received by the Government
($17 billion); and investments, loans and placements, largely deposits at the Reserve Bank
($24 billion). The major liabilities are superannuation liabilities ($88 billion) and gross debt
issuance ($61 billion).

There are two notable aspects to the Australian Government balance sheet. First, the
government has reduced net debt to very low levels — net debt has fallen from $96 billion
(18.2 per cent of GDP) in 1996-97 to $23 billion (2.9 per cent of GDP) in 2003-04. This is in
stark contrast with the net debt positions in nearly all other OECD countries (Chart 1).

The reduction in net debt reflects fiscal surpluses and asset sales over a number of years. It also
reflects that these surpluses have been invested in debt assets. Following the Review of the
Commonwealth Government Securities Market 2002, the Government decided to maintain the
domestic bond market to facilitate interest rate risk management by the private sector. The
Government therefore maintains a stock of around $50 billion of mainly long dated securities,
while investing the proceeds of debt issuance in term deposits at the Reserve Bank of Australia.
The other notable feature about the balance sheet is that the Government’s most significant
financial liability is public sector superannuation, estimated to grow to $105 billion (9.9 per cent
of GDP) by 2008-09 (Commonwealth of Australia, 2005). While this liability is expected to
increase further in the future, a significant portion reflects liabilities to past government
employees. The Australian Government closed the main public sector superannuation fund to

7

new members from 1 July 2005. This means the government will pay the superannuation
liability for new public servants employed after this date as they accrue, rather than growing the
superannuation liability further. Also, in 2004-05 the government paid $4.6 billion to Telstra
and Australia Post to extinguish remanent superannuation liabilities from the corporatisation of
these firms a decade or so ago.
Despite these policies, the existing superannuation liability is expected to remain sizeable,
reaching $140 billion in 2020 (7.1 per cent of GDP), largely due to growth in the superannuation
schemes for Military and Defence employees.4

In response to these financial management challenges, the government has announced the
creation of a ‘Future Fund’ with the aim of offsetting the Government’s unfunded
superannuation liabilities by 2020. The fund will assist in increasing the Government’s net

worth and increasing national savings. Contributions will be made to the fund whenever the
budget is in surplus. That is, rather than realised budget surpluses being used to retire debt or
build up term deposits at the Reserve Bank as currently occurs, they will be invested in the fund.
The fund will be established using accumulated cash reserves currently on term deposit with
the Reserve Bank. Additional contributions from realised surpluses and the reinvestment of
returns on the fund’s assets will be needed to meet the Government’s target.

2.2 Contingent risks
The government balance sheet provides important information on the financial performance of
the government from period to period. An increasing net worth means that a government is
reducing rather than increasing net liabilities on future generations. However, there are many
rights and obligations of government that are excluded from the balance sheet, mainly because
of valuation problems. The most significant item missing from the balance sheet is the ‘primary
asset’ of the government — the power to tax. 5 While this power is limited by such factors as the
constitution, international tax competition, the size and growth of the economy, the effects of tax
rate and base changes on economic efficiency and equity — the taxing power provides strong
assurance of the government’s ability to meet its liabilities.
On the other side of the ledger, certain explicit government obligations that do not meet
accounting standards tests for the recognition of liabilities are also not recorded. 6 Under the
international IMF GFS framework, only obligations payable in any event are on balance sheet,
whereas those that occur only on uncertain events (even if they are probable) are not
(International Monetary Fund, 2001:34). Unless presented carefully, this can lead to

5
6

Problems also exist in valuing substantial heritage assets on the balance sheet, such as Parliament House and
the Australian War Memorial.
This paper is concerned only with explicit financial risks, defined as rights or obligations on government
established by law or contract. Implicit financial risks provide a different set of policy problems, such as
policy issues, which are beyond the scope of this paper.
9

mis-understanding of the underlying economic value of specific assets and liabilities on a
government’s balance sheet. For example, the Australian Government departs from the GFS
framework by recording provisions against expected defaults on student loans in the balance
sheet. 7
Probably the largest contingent liabilities not recorded on the balance sheet relate to future
pensions and public health costs. However, these obligations to fund future expenses have an
impact on the economy today, as well as on fiscal sustainability. So the Charter also requires
the government to produce an inter-generational report every five years, which essentially
captures those obligations not recorded on the balance sheet. The last report from 2002-03
projected spending associated with an ageing population to require a fiscal adjustment of
5.0 per cent of GDP by 2041-42, or $87 billion in 2002-03 dollars (Commonwealth of Australia,
1:2002a).
These conceptual and measurement problems mean the government balance sheet is not directly
comparable with similar private sector financial statements. 8

Government balance sheet

management therefore requires a different framework for determining whether investment
strategies are optimal. In particular, contingent assets and liabilities are likely to have a
significant influence on how best to structure the government balance sheet to reduce risk and
improve fiscal sustainability.

The Swedish government budgets by appropriating the anticipated loss from guarantees for individual risks,
ensuring equivalence between traditional outlays and financial instruments that transfer risk to the
government (Hagelin and Thor, 2003). Similarly, the governments of the United States and the Netherlands
explicitly appropriate the subsidy component of concessional loans and loan guarantees (Schick, 2002:90).
The Australian National Audit Office has valued the potential exposure from other selected financial
instruments containing contingent risks — such as financial guarantees — at $115 billion (ANAO, 2003).
Indeed, the National Commission of Audit (Commonwealth of Australia, 1996) recommended that the term
‘balance sheet’ be replaced with ‘Statement of Assets and Liabilities’ to avoid misleading comparisons with
the private sector.

3. GOVERNMENT BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT
The government balance sheet is a measure of the government’s financial position at a point in
time. Government balance sheet management is concerned with how the balance sheet may
move through time. Managing the risks affecting the government balance sheet can assist in
avoiding, or at least ameliorating, sharp changes in the financial position flowing from
macroeconomic shocks. In particular, a government’s balance sheet can be significantly
affected by contingent risks affecting the tax base. This paper argues that a government
financial portfolio – including financial assets, superannuation liabilities and government
securities – can be structured to reduce the financial impact of these risks.
Despite reportedly sound monetary and fiscal policies, as well as high domestic savings rates,
many Asian economies suffered serious recessions in the late 1990’s (for example World Bank,
1993). These recessions were compounded, if not caused, by the crystalisation of contingent
liabilities, particularly around commitments to support exchange rates and banking systems.
Public injections into the banking system after the Asian crisis more than doubled the size of
government debt to GDP in Korea and Thailand (Wheeler, 2004:105). 9 In emerging countries
more generally over the 1990s, bail outs to public enterprises and banking systems have
contributed more to the build up of government debt than recurrent deficits (Kharas and Mishra,
2001). Indeed, the deterioration in the debt positions of emerging countries since the 1990’s has
been largely attributed to interest rate and exchange rate movements and the recognition of
off-balance sheet and contingent liabilities (International Monetary Fund, 2003:117).
For developed nations, managing balance sheet risks may not be as important in averting crises.
However, balance sheet management can be used to improve the fiscal sustainability of

Korea’s government debt to GDP ratio went from 10.5 per cent to 26.5 per cent after the costs of bank
recapitalisation, while Thailand went from 14.6 per cent to 46.6 per cent.
11

government through time (and ultimately, avoid financial crises). 10 Since governments can rely
on taxation to finance themselves, the concept of fiscal sustainability must relate in some way to
the expected path of taxation. Fiscal sustainability not only requires that governments are likely
to remain solvent — in the sense that the anticipated path of taxation is reasonable — but that
the volatility (or risks) around that path are not significant. The International Monetary Fund is
incorporating country risk analyses into their fiscal sustainability assessments for some countries
(for example, Barnhill and Kopits, 2003). Indeed, the relationship between taxation and balance
sheet assets and liabilities is central to the economics literature on balance sheet management.
3.1 A framework for analysis
3.1.1 Inter-temporal budget constraint
An important conceptual tool for analyzing government balance sheet management is the
inter-temporal budget constraint. This budget constraint requires that at any date the sum of net
worth and the net present value of taxation be equal to the net present value of government
spending.
In this way, the inter-temporal budget constraint relates the government balance sheet in any
period to the contingent asset and liabilities that can affect the balance sheet.

11

If current

period government spending is higher than current period taxation, the government can issue
debt (or some other liability). However, this simply means taxes need to be higher sometime in
the future. In this framework, debt (and other liabilities) passed onto the future are effectively

10

11

There are other potential objectives of debt management policy, such as attempting to ameliorate the effects
of incomplete or imperfect markets (eg improving market efficiency through improved risk sharing).
However, alternative objectives have a less secure conceptual basis and some implementation problems (see
Missale, 1997).
In a series of excellent papers (from Bradbury et al, 1999 and Grimes, 2001, onwards) the New Zealand
Treasury has used the inter-temporal budget constraint to derive the concept of ‘comprehensive net worth’
for balance sheet management purposes.

12

‘congealed taxation’. The inter-temporal budget constraint requires taxes to rise from their
current levels to finance future anticipated expenses.

3.1.2 Tax smoothing
Once the limit to future taxation and spending is identified, the optimal path of taxation needs to
be found. Barro (1979) uses the standard public finance assumption that the excess burden of
taxation rises by more than any rise in the tax rate — a doubling of tax rates has more than twice
as many costs. These costs are the loss in overall welfare caused by tax rates distorting
individual’s and firm’s consumption choices.
Given anticipated government expenditure, these costs are minimised through time if tax
(defined as a proportion of GDP) is constant, with temporary macroeconomic shocks leading to
deficit financing and surpluses. That is, for a given financing requirement, a constant tax rate
through time will impose a smaller cost on the economy than would a low tax rate in one year
and a high tax rate in the next. An important implication of tax smoothing is that it is
anticipated future tax rises, rather than simply current tax rates, which distort economic
behaviour. For example, if tax rates are expected to rise significantly in the future, investment
(and therefore growth) is likely to be discouraged. This standard result on optimal long run
fiscal policy accords with the Australian Government’s commitment of ‘no increase in the
overall tax burden from 1996-97 levels’.
This result depends critically on assumptions of the excess burden of taxation. 12 In the absence
of these costs, there may be no role for Government to smooth taxes through time, since
individuals could adjust their own portfolios to account for the uncertainty in future tax
liabilities. It is the presence of such costs which gives government balance sheet management
its power.

12

If the loss function is linear, then there is no need to minimise the variance in tax rates (Hansen, 2003:9).
13

3.1.3 Balance sheet risk
For a macroeconomic shock that temporarily reduces economic growth, the government could
resort to deficit financing by selling financial assets or issuing debt. However, if an
unanticipated shock lead to a permanent change in the resources available to government (for
example, a fall in the present value of taxation revenue), the government would need to adjust
fiscal policy because deficit financing would not be sustainable. Alternatively, governments
could attempt to structure their financial portfolios to hedge against such risks.
Bohn (1990) extends the tax smoothing result to incorporate such uncertainty, by imposing a
budget constraint across all anticipated states of the world, as well as across time. Bohn shows
that the government can reduce the expectation that tax rates will change, by holding and issuing
specific financial instruments. 13 In particular, an effective budget hedge would see the
government’s financial returns vary negatively with tax revenue during a macroeconomic shock.
For example, the government’s balance sheet is protected somewhat if it issues debt where
repayments fall with economic growth and tax revenue.
This framework suggests that the optimal portfolio for a country depends on the structure of the
economy. If an economy is susceptible to supply side shocks, where inflation and growth move
in opposite directions, then nominal debt issuance performs such a role. For example, the real
value of government debt falls if an oil shock causes recession and inflation. Alternatively, if an
economy is subject to demand side shocks, where inflation and growth are positively correlated,
then inflation-indexed and variable interest rate debt are better hedges. Of course, ex ante, it is
extremely difficult to form an assessment of the types of shocks an economy will be subjected to
in the future.

13

Bohn (1990) assumes risk neutral individuals, so the costs relate to the expectation that taxes will change.
For risk averse individuals, the uncertainty that the government will raise taxes at times of low financial
returns (i.e. high marginal utility of consumption) is an additional cost (see the Appendix in Hansen, 2003).
14

3.2 Formal presentation of the model
The intuition expressed above is set out more formally below and draws on the model developed
by Bohn (1990).
Individuals are assumed to be infinitely lived and risk neutral, and maximise the expected utility
derived from all future consumption:
U t = Et ∑ ρ j ct + j

(1)

j ≥0

where ρ is a discount factor, and ct+j is consumption in period t + j.
Individuals receive a stream of endowments Yt+j and pay taxes on endowments at a rate τt. As
taxes are distortionary there is an excess burden of taxation denoted by a convex loss function
h(τt). Individuals are also able to trade a given set of assets, so that the individual budget
constraint is given by

ct + ∑ pt ,k At ,k = Yt [1 − τ t − h(τ t )] + ∑ ( pt , k + f t ,k ) At −1, k
k

(2)

k

where At,k is the quantity of asset k held at the end of period t; pt,k is the price of asset k (denoted
in terms of consumption goods); and ft+j,k is the stream of cash flows derived from holding asset
k. Individual optimisation implies that expected returns across assets are equal, that is:
Et(1+rt+1,k) = 1/ρ for all k, where rt+1,k = ( pt +1, k + f t +1,k ) / pt , k − 1 . This assumption is non-trivial,

particularly so when we introduce equities into our analysis.
The government can use tax revenues τtYt and issue debt, Bt,k, to finance government
expenditure, Gt (which we treat as exogenous in this model), and to meet outstanding debt
obligations. The government budget constraint is given by:

τ tYt + ∑ pt ,k Bt ,k = Gt + ∑ ( pt ,k + ft ,k )Bt −1,k
k

(3)

k

15

The government can choose the type of debt instrument, k, and may be a net lender or net
borrower in any security, as such Bt should be interpreted as the government’s net liabilities.
B

Following Bohn, we recast the objective function in terms of government policy by substituting
(2) and (3) into (1), which gives 14

{

}

U t = Et ∑ ρ j Yt + j ⎡⎣1 − h (τ t + j ) ⎤⎦
j ≥0

(4)

The government chooses an optimal tax rate and debt portfolio to maximise individual utility (4)
subject to its own budget constraint (3). In effect, the government’s objective is to choose the
structure of taxes and debt that minimise the expected present value of the excess burden of

h(τt). The first-order conditions are 15
Et ⎡⎣ h ' (τ t +1 ) ⎤⎦ = h ' (τ t ) for k = 0

ρ Et ⎡⎣ h ' (τ t +1 ) (1 + rt +1,k )⎤⎦ = h ' (τ t ) for k > 0

(5)

where k = 0 is the risk free asset. That is, optimality requires that the expected marginal excess
burden of taxation is constant through time.
As in Bohn, we assume a quadratic excess burden, so that the deadweight loss of a tax rate, τt, is

h(τt) = (h/2)τt2. It follows then from the first order conditions that an optimal policy requires
Covt (τˆt + 1, rˆt + 1, k ) = 0

(6)

where τˆt +1 = τ t +1 − Eτ t +1 is the innovation in the tax rate, and rˆt + 1, k is the innovation in the return
to asset k. These innovations reflect the unanticipated components of changes in tax rates or
returns.

14 As in Bohn (1990) we drop exogenous terms for simplicity, as they are irrelevant for deriving the first order
conditions for optimality.
15 See Appendix A for derivation of the first order conditions.
16

Equation (6) implies zero conditional covariance between taxes and returns on available
securities. That is, if the covariance between innovations in the tax rate and returns, for a
specific debt, is negative then the government could improve tax-smoothing by issuing more of
this form of debt. The converse is also true: if the covariance is positive then the government
could improve tax smoothing by purchasing more of this form of debt. This is the principal
conclusion of Bohn — the government should smooth tax rates across different states of the
world, as well as over time.
3.3 The optimal structure of the Government’s balance sheet

To estimate the government’s optimal portfolio an expression for the innovation in tax rates is
required. The innovation in the tax rate determined by the government’s budget constraint is:
⎡

⎤

τˆt +1 = (1 −ψ ) e− y ⎢ ∑ rˆt +1,k dt ,k + ∑ ρ j gˆ t +1+ j ⎥ − τ t ∑ψ j yˆt +1+ j
⎣

k

j ≥0

⎦

(7)

j ≥0

where yt is the growth rate of real output and y is its mean. The term

∑

ψ j yˆt +1+ j is the

j ≥0

present value of innovations in future growth rates of real output, where ψ is the discount factor
and yˆt +1+ j = Et +1 yt +1+ j − Et yt +1+ j . That is, it captures unexpected permanent changes in output and

therefore in the government’s ability to raise tax revenues at a constant tax rate. Similarly,

∑

j ≥0

ρ j gˆ t +1+ j is the present value of innovations in government spending relative to output,

where gˆ t +1+ j = ( Et +1Gt +1+ j − Et Gt +1+ j ) / Yt . The ratio of security k debt to output is denoted by dt,k.
The intuition behind equation (7) is that the present value of tax revenues must cover initial debt
plus the present value of government spending. That is, tax rates will need to adjust whenever
there are unexpected changes in the value of government debt, government spending or output
growth. For a government that is already optimally managing the balance sheet, the current tax
rate already incorporates anticipated obligations.

17

Substituting the above into equation (6) gives the optimality condition for each government
security:

where wt = ⎢
⎥ τ t is a weighting factor.
⎣ (1 −ψ ) ⎦
That is, the government can smooth taxes to offset unexpected shocks in the present value of
government spending and output through the issuance or purchase of state contingent securities.
As the paper focuses on shocks that affect the present value of output growth, we assume that
the covariance between innovations in the present value of government spending and returns on
assets (the second term in equation (8)), is zero. The following equation provides us with a
solution to the government’s optimal portfolio: 17

where

r

is the variance–covariance matrix of returns (assumed to be non-singular) and

innovations in real output growth.
3.3.1 Methodology

In order to solve equation (9) and evaluate the optimality of various portfolios of government
assets, we need to calculate innovations in returns and the present value of future rates of growth
in real output.

16

17

For the purposes of the empirical analysis, we assume a discount factor of 0.98 (which equates to a 2 per
cent per quarter discount), an average tax rate of 24 per cent and an average real growth rate of 0.75 per cent
per quarter. The value of the weighting factor does not affect any of the qualitative conclusions.

We limit our analysis to a bivarate comparison. For our first analysis we are interested in the
optimal share of long-term domestic debt and long-term foreign debt. We then extend this
analysis to consider alternative asset classes, such as equites.
The real return on long-term domestic debt, rt+1,d, is influenced by the domestic nominal long
term interest rate lt+1, changes in the current long-term market interest rate (which is used as an
approximation of the capital gain component), and domestic inflation, πt+1. 18 Foreign long-term
debt returns, rt+1,f, will in addition be influenced by the change in the exchange rate Δst+1.
Innovations in returns are therefore given by:
rˆt +1, d = − (

rˆt +1, f = − (

t +1, d

− Et

t +1, d

t +1, f

− Et

t +1, f

) − (π
) − (π

t +1

− Etπ t +1 )

t +1

− Etπ t +1 ) + ( Δst +1 − Et Δst +1 )

To calculate these innovations in real returns, vector autoregressions (VARs) are used to
formulate expectations for the inflation rate, the percentage change in the exchange rate, the
long-term domestic interest rate and the long-term foreign interest rate. Following Hawkesby
and Wright (1997) expectations are formed for each variable (yt+1, πt+1, lt+1,d, Δst+1, lt+1,f) by
regressing that variable on a constant and one lag of the variable, together with one lag of all
other variables. 19 As expectations at time t depend only on information available up to time t,
we must run a new VAR for each time period. 20

18

19

20

The proxy used for capital gains may lead to an understatement of this component in the innovation of real
returns since it does not take into account the time to maturity. The longer the time to maturity the larger will
be the capital gain (or loss) associated with changes in interest rates.
The lag specification was chosen based on the lag length that minimised the Akaike and Schwarz
information criteria. The estimated model does not capture the full range of variables that could be expected
to determine output and inflation. For a more complete model of the Australian economy see Dungey and
Pagan (2000).
This essentially involves growing the sample size with each estimation. We also investigated an alternative
approach of rolling the sample, thereby keeping the sample size constant. However, this did not have a
material impact on the results.

19

The same method is used to calculate innovations in the growth of real output:
yˆ t +1+ j = Et +1 yt +1+ j − Et yt +1+ j

. Expectations for real output growth need to be formed at each time

period for rates of growth in all future time periods. That is an expectation is formed at time t,
for (yt+1, yt+2,…..yt+n) and at time t+1 for (yt+1, yt+2,…..yt+n) given the additional information. The
differences in expectations are then discounted at a rate, ψ (assumed to be 0.98). 21 This process
is repeated for each time period to derive a time series for innovations in the present value of
output.
The methodology used to derive innovations in equity returns and output is the same as that
outlined above, with innovations in equity returns given by:

(

)

rˆt +1,e = pt +1, f − Et p t +1, f − (π t +1 − Etπ t +1 ) + ( Δst +1 − Et Δst +1 )

(

)

where pˆ t +1 = p*t +1 − Et p*t+1 is the unanticipated component of capital gains. Capital gains are
calculated using accumulation share indices for each country, which incorporate both share price
growth and dividend growth.
3.3.2 Data

All data are quarterly data for the post float period 1983:4 — 2004:3. Long-term interest rates
are the long-term government bond yields converted into quarterly returns. We take the first
difference in bond yields, as we cannot reject non-stationarity over the sample period (based on
the Augmented Dickey-Fuller and Phillips-Perron tests). Expectations for bond yields are then
derived from the summing the expectations of the first difference. Equity returns are derived
using accumulation indices when these are available and for the periods where they are not,
capital weighted share indices are used (this effectively assumes that dividend growth is

We also estimated the results using a lower discount factor, which did not change our broad conclusions.
However, the case for investing abroad was slightly weaker under this scenario.
20

constant over this period). The exchange rate data is the log difference of the spot exchange rate
expressed as the Australian dollar price of foreign currency. Inflation is estimated by taking the
log differences of the GDP deflator. Growth rates in output are the log differences of real GDP.
3.3.3. Results

Table 2 shows the variance-covariance matrix for innovations series using domestic and foreign
debt. The results show that innovations in domestic returns and foreign returns vary negatively
with innovations in output. This suggests that it is optimal for the Australian Government to
purchase securities denominated in both domestic and foreign currency. These results are
consistent with the findings of Hawkesby and Wright (1997) and Missale (1999).

Note: The above results are for pair-wise comparisons between Australia and the reported country. This means that
a separate VAR is calculated for each country including five variables: output, inflation, nominal domestic bond
yield, nominal foreign bond yield, and the percentage change in the exchange rate.

We also report the optimal portfolio of domestic and foreign debt as a ratio to quarterly GDP,
calculated by solving equation (9). These shares should be interpreted with some caution, as the
magnitudes are sensitive to the estimation methodology. We discuss some of the key
qualifications in detail below. With this in mind, the results show that it is optimal for the
government to invest a relatively larger amount in domestic rather than foreign debt. This is
largely driven by the volatility in the exchange rate, which acts as a ‘penalty’ on foreign
investment. Volatility in the exchange rate (and therefore in foreign returns) is not necessarily

21

bad, provided innovations in the exchange vary negatively with innovations in output. While
this is the case for Japan and Germany, our results show a positive covariance between
innovations in the exchange rate and output for the US. 22
The above results can be disaggregated into the various elements that make up innovations (or
unexpected changes) in returns (see Appendix C). Doing so reveals that there is a positive
covariance between innovations in output and inflation, which is a key driver of our results. This
implies that periods of unexpectedly low inflation (and therefore high returns) have tended to
occur during periods of unexpectedly low output. This may largely result from the early 1990s
recession, where inflation and domestic interest rates fell substantially.
Turning now to equities, a priori, we might expect that it would be unlikely that domestic equity
investment would provide an effective hedge against macroeconomic shocks, given the high
correlation between company profits and output. This is confirmed by our results, which show
that the covariance between innovations in domestic equities and output is positive (table 3).

Note: The above results are for pair-wise comparisons between domestic debt securities and equities in the reported
country. This means that a separate VAR is calculated for each country including five variables: output, inflation,
nominal domestic bond yield, equity prices (to proxy capital gains), and the percentage change in the exchange rate.

22

The volatility in the exchange may be partly driven by the method used to derive exchange rate innovations.
Meese and Rogoff (1983) have shown that models used to explain exchange rate movements over short
intervals, generally perform worse than a simple random walk.
22

In contrast, the covariance between innovations in foreign equities and output is negative,
suggesting that an optimal portfolio would include some investment in foreign equities for the
countries considered.
3.4 Qualifications

There are some significant qualifications to our results that require further investigative effort.
First, the paper focuses on unconstrained portfolios for only a select number of countries.
Further work to determine the optimal constrained portfolio involving multi-variate financial
assets needs to be undertaken before using the model for policy purposes. For example, the
optimal portfolio suggests that 2 per cent of quarterly GDP should be invested in German
shares. This is clearly unrealistic. However, in the absence of obvious constraints on the
portfolio at the time of writing this paper, we decided to report the unconstrained case only.
Similarly, Japan, Germany and the United States were chosen since they represent the largest
economies in their respective geographical regions of Asia, Europe and the Americas.
Second, we have ignored the relationship between innovations in output and government
spending. That is, government expenditure is also likely to be linked to macroeconomic shocks
and potentially able to be offset by government financial investment policy. It is likely that the
effects of a macroeconomic shock on spending reinforce the impact on taxation. However,
Bohn (1990) suggests that this impact is likely to be small and insignificant. In theory it should
be possible to determine the present value risk characteristics associated with major expense
obligations (such as health care) and invest in assets to offset these risks.
Third, the results are based on agents forming expectations on future financial risks based on
past financial events. This expectations formulation defies the rational expectations (Lucas)
critique that economic agents should use all available information when forming expectations —
past returns (or risks) are no guide to future returns (or risks) in the presence of significant
policy change (Lucas, 1976). In particular, Australia has been subject to significant economic
23

reforms over the past two decades which may make relying on certain systematic relationships
to form expectations difficult. However, nearly all financial models in regular use rely on past
data to measure risks (for example, the capital asset pricing model). Further, our results use data
from 1983, after the floating of the Australian dollar, which was perhaps the largest structural
change in the financial sector.
Finally, the model does not explicitly incorporate the existing stock of assets and liabilities held
by other levels of government and by the private sector. In Australia, the State governments are
in a net asset positions (2 per cent of GDP in 2004-05), however the private sector has
significant net external debt (48 per cent of GDP in 2004-05). The current model assumes that
the obligations of the private sector and other governments are independent of the fiscal position
of the Australian Government. By focusing only on the explicit assets and liabilities of the
central government (ie rights or obligations established by law or contract), the paper ignores
those that may be implicit (ie rights or obligations dependent on moral suasion). For example,
the community may expect the government to take over some of the financial obligations of
large financial institutions that would otherwise be subject to failure. These expectations make
the distinction between private and public sector debt in the paper (and by investors) less clear.
One potential way around this caveat is to include the net external obligations of the private
sector when determining the optimal government portfolio. 23 For example, roughly half of net
Australian private sector debt is held in US dollars, implying that an optimal portfolio would
hold less of these liabilities if the government were also considering implicit risks on the
government balance sheet. Of course, there may be significant moral hazard type problems for

23

The model incorporates implicit liabilities to the extent they are incorporated in Gt. Managing the
government balance sheet against implicit obligations is problematical for the moral hazard reasons
discussed in section 4.2.1 below.

24

any government which makes this an explicit portfolio objective (see the discussion on policy
endogeneity in Section 4).

4. DISCUSSION
4.1 Policy implications

The key conclusion from the debt management literature is that the optimal financial investment
strategy depends on the types of shocks affecting the macro economy. That is, the optimal way
to structure debt (short or long, nominal or price-indexed, domestic or foreign currency) or
invest in financial assets is an empirical question. Hansen (2003) (following Missale (1997))
summarised the main results from this literature:
(a)

buy (short-sell) assets whose returns have a positive (negative) correlation to public
spending and negative (positive) correlation to the tax base; and

(b)

issue


nominal debt for government spending and productivity shocks;



price-indexed debt for monetary and real demand shocks causing inflation;



foreign currency debt when output and inflation shocks are correlated
internationally;



maturity structure of debt to match structure of planned fiscal surpluses; and



short maturity debt when positive correlation between output and real interest rates.

Our results suggest that the Australian economy has been subject to more demand shocks than
supply side shocks over the sample period. If this were to continue to be the case going forward,
then the tax smoothing framework adopted in this paper suggests that the government should
purchase domestic nominal bonds. During high output periods in Australia, inflation and tax
revenues would increase offset by lower real returns on domestic nominal bonds, such as
25

government (including State government debt) or high grade corporate debt. However, during
low output periods, inflation and tax revenues will fall and be offset by higher real returns to
domestic nominal bonds. These results support the government’s policy of reducing net debt —
both by reducing the size of gross debt issuance and investing in debt assets. The results also
suggest that balance sheet risk could be further reduced by issuing price-indexed bonds (such as
Treasury indexed bonds), rather than nominal bonds.
Our results also suggest that investing in foreign equities is likely to reduce overall balance sheet
risk. In effect, the government already has a significant stake in Australian equities because of
the tax revenue earned from domestic capital income (not to mention the presumably highly
correlated flow on effects through taxation of domestic labour income). Auerbach (2004) notes
that, even though the US government does not hold much equity directly, it has significant
exposure to variations in stock prices through its claims to future tax revenues. Indeed,
Auerbach argues that the US government’s ‘implicit equity position’ is larger than the stock
market itself, consistent with the fact that revenues from all sources are responsive to stock
market returns.
4.2 Potential criticisms
4.2.1 Policy endogeneity

There are some important criticisms of the tax smoothing approach that can affect our policy
conclusions. First, there is the potential problem of policy endogeneity. If the government’s
improved financial asset performance encourages greater government spending then the
independence between government spending and taxing is violated. Similarly, there may be
risks that if the government takes a controlling interest in a domestic company, some sections of
the community may expect increased assistance for that company. In such circumstances, the
optimal balance sheet strategy for government might be to avoid accruing a financial asset
portfolio altogether and simply eliminate all risk, balancing the budget through the cycle (see
26

Pinfield, 1998). Another potential solution is to restrict the degree of controlling interest a
government investment fund can maintain in specific domestic companies. Further, it is
unlikely that the Future Fund will increase the incentive of future governments to spend more on
public sector superannuation expenses. The bulk of the super liability relates to previously
accrued entitlements that are reasonably well defined. Finally, the government reports its
underlying cash surplus exclusive of fund earnings so that they cannot be used for recurrent
expenditure.
Moral hazard is a particularly severe form of policy endogeneity that appears to have limited the
use of some financial instruments to manage government balance sheets. Traditionally, the
economics literature on optimal debt management has focused on ‘state-contingent’ debt. As
early as 1941, inflation-indexed bonds were seen as a means for removing the incentive of
governments to inflate the economy and reduce the real value of their obligations (Bach and
Musgrave, 1941). However, in the real world there is little evidence of state-contingent debt
instruments being issued by governments. 24 This may primarily be due to some state-contingent
debt instruments being subject to moral hazard problems (sometimes referred to as ‘time
inconsistency’) if governments can affect the states (Calvo and Guidotti, 1990; Bohn, 1990).
For example, bond returns that fall when an index of government expenditure rises would hedge
the balance sheet against economic downturns. However, governments would also have an
incentive to increase expenditure. This risk would then be priced in the value of such bonds,
making them unattractive even for well-intentioned governments to issue.
More recently, the literature has focused on hedging the balance sheet by optimal design of the
maturity and denomination of conventional debt securities. For example, a shorter average debt

24

Real world examples include Mexico issuing bonds tied to oil prices and Costa Rica, Bulgaria and Bosnia
issuing bonds containing an element of indexation to GDP (Borensztein and Mauro, 2002). Even in
Australia, the pool of inflation indexed bonds is relatively small, with outstanding Treasury Indexed Bonds
around 10 per cent (or $6.4 billion) of total Commonwealth debt (Commonwealth of Australia, 2002b).
27

maturity increases the exposure to short term interest rate rises. Long maturities can avoid
exposure to ‘roll-over’ risk (Barro, 1995). It is not necessary, as our results show, to issue state
contingent debt to offset specific balance sheet risks. Investing in a broad and diverse range of
financial assets effectively eliminates moral hazard type problems.
4.2.2 Agency costs

Second, there are significant agency costs associated with government management of financial
assets. In the tax smoothing model, the government is assumed to maximize the welfare of all
individuals in the community. However, in practice the incentives of government and the agents
used by government may not be so aligned. This can lead to poor investment decisions. The
solution to the agency cost problem is to ensure that the governance of the Future Fund is clear
and transparent and investments are made on a commercial basis within the investment
guidelines set by government. Indeed, applying best corporate practice would allow individual
government financial entities to set their own strategic asset allocation, after taking into account
the nature of their liabilities (Grimes, 2001). This is likely to improve governance,
accountability and entity performance. In the case of the Future Fund, this would involve
directing the Fund to invest in assets of a similar risk to the government’s superannuation
liabilities.
In dealing with agency costs, the government imposes constraints on the optimal portfolio. The
significance of these constraints has been highlighted by the results of Fowlie and Wright (1997)
for New Zealand. They found that the optimal financial portfolio incorporated foreign currency
denominated debt when taxes are included, but only domestic debt when taxes are excluded.
This means that a narrow focus only on balance sheet assets can lead to financial investments
that increase the chances of volatile tax changes.
However, this does not mean that financial investment decisions should not be decentralized
(down to an agency level) or linked to narrow portfolio benchmarks (such as matching financial
28

assets to future superannuation liabilities). Rather, a single central agency needs to be aware of
how individual elements of the balance sheet interact with each other during macroeconomic
shocks. Some commentators see the centralisation of broader balance sheet risk management
with debt management as a ‘logical step’ (Currie and Velandia-Rubiano, 2002). For example,
the Swedish Debt Management Office advises government on the costs of contingent liabilities
and the government debt portfolio (Hörngren, 2003a). 25 Such a structure allows natural hedges
in the balance sheet to be identified, reducing the need (and costs) from individual agencies
hedging. Alternatively, such a balance sheet perspective allows for large cumulative risks to be
identified and brought to the attention of government (Wheeler, 2004:67).
4.2.3 Imperfect capital markets

The model discussed in this paper assumes that capital markets are not perfect; or at least that
certain restrictions exist that stop governments from using financial instruments to perfectly
hedge balance sheet risk. While governments can use some existing financial instruments to
reduce balance sheet risk, certain types of risks are still likely to remain unhedged. In particular,
incomplete capital markets may mean governments are unable to hedge against certain types of
risks (such as catastrophic risk). There may be no private sector substitutes for government
bonds (Arrow and Lind 1970, Stiglitz 1983). If capital markets are incomplete, there may be
gains from governments issuing standardised products which can outweigh benefits from
state-contingent products (Missale, 1997). Alternatively, governments may have other policy
objectives, such as maintaining some debt to allow the development of important financial
products (Comley and Turvey, 2005). There may also be other reasons for investing
domestically. For example, informational, governance or tax advantages may lead to a home

25

Other countries where debt managers are integrated with contingent liability management include New
Zealand, South Africa and Colombia (Wheeler, 2004:24).
29

country bias for equities (for a review, see Karolyi and Stulz, 2002). Such constraints can limit
the ability of government’s movement towards the optimal portfolio outlined in this paper.
Even if capital markets are imperfect, government’s can still invest in financial assets to the
fullest extent possible using available securities. For the remnant unhedged risks, the
government should consider building and maintaining a positive balance of net worth as
self-insurance against large rare events. 26

5. CONCLUSION

The economics literature relating to balance sheet management suggests that the government’s
financial portfolio should be structured to reduce the budget impacts of macroeconomic shocks.
More specifically, an optimally structured balance sheet can reduce the risk that a major
macroeconomic shock will see large changes in tax rates. This not only reduces the distortions
caused by volatile tax rates, but increases the flexibility of governments to respond to
unexpected fiscal pressures. A government that invests well has less need to significantly raise
taxes or cut spending to finance itself. In most countries, this has meant structuring the debt
portfolio so that liabilities do not become overly burdensome during recessions. However,
Australia is amongst a small number of countries determining how best to structure a financial
portfolio that includes positive net financial assets. 27
This paper has shown that it is not only the budget position that is important for sustainability,
but how the financial assets and liabilities of government are allocated. Our results support the
Future Fund investing in a broad range of financial assets that includes nominal domestic debt

26
27

Hansen (2003:11) notes that building a ‘precautionary balance’ is worthwhile if and only if the unhedged
risks would otherwise result in a negative correlation between tax rates and consumption.
Other OECD countries with significant financial asset funds (including pension funds) are New Zealand,
Norway, Ireland, Finland Denmark (see Comley and McKissack, 2005).
30

and equities from selected countries. Indeed, by investing optimally the government is likely to
reduce risks on the budget and improve growth prospects.

The government chooses taxes and debt to maximise the individual objective function (A1)
subject to its budget constraint (A2).

{

}

U t = Et ∑ ρ j Yt + j ⎡⎣1 − h (τ t + j ) ⎤⎦
j ≥0

{

(A1)

}

= EtYt ⎡⎣1 − h (τ t ) ⎤⎦ + ρ Et Yt +1 ⎡⎣1 − h (τ t +1 ) ⎤⎦ + ...

τ tYt + ∑ pt ,k Bt ,k = Gt + ∑ ( pt ,k + ft ,k )Bt −1,k
k

(A2)

k

From the budget constraint, we can solve for τt , τt+1 , etc, and substitute into the objective
function, Ut, which can then be maximised with respect to Bt,k, Bt+1,k , etc.
The first order condition with respect to Bt,k is:
⎧⎪ ⎡
⎧⎪ ⎡
∂U t
∂τ ⎤ ⎫⎪
∂τ ⎤ ⎫⎪
= Et ⎨Yt ⎢ − h ' (τ t ) t ⎥ ⎬ + ρ Et ⎨Yt +1 ⎢ h ' (τ t +1 ) t +1 ⎥ ⎬ = 0
∂Bt ,k
∂Bt ,k ⎦⎥ ⎭⎪
∂Bt , k ⎦⎥ ⎪⎭
⎩⎪ ⎣⎢
⎩⎪ ⎣⎢

(A3)

Now, from the constraints:
p
∂τ t
= − t ,k
Yt
∂Bt , k

∂τ t +1 ( pt +1,k + ft +1.k )
=
Yt +1
∂Bt ,k

and,

(A4)

Substituting into (A3) gives:

{

}

Et {− h ' (τ t ) pt , k } + ρ Et h ' (τ t +1 ) ( pt +1, k + f t +1, k ) = 0
Since pt,k is known at time t, and τt is chosen at time t, equation (A4) can be written as:
⎧⎪ h ' (τ t +1 ) ( pt +1, k + f t +1, k ) ⎫⎪
h ' (τ t ) = ρ Et ⎨
⎬
pt , k
⎩⎪
⎭⎪

Recalling that rt+1,k = (pt+1,k+ ft+1,k)/pt,k — 1, and noting also that the condition that expected
returns must be equal implies that for the risk free asset (defined as k = 0), r ≡ 1/ρ — 1, then the
above expression will yield the first-order condition obtained in equation (5) of section 3.

APPENDIX B: DERIVATION OF EQUATION (9)

The optimality condition for each Government security k (k=1,…,K) given in equation (8) is:

∑ cov ( rˆ

t +1, k

l

⎛

⎛
⎞
, rˆt +1,l ) dt ,l + covt ⎜ rˆt +1,k , ∑ p j gˆ t +1+ j ⎟ − wt covt ⎜ rˆt +1,k , ∑ψ j yˆt +1+ j ⎟ = 0
j ≥0
j ≥0
⎝
⎠
⎝
⎠

(B1)

As discussed in Section 3 we assume that the second term is equal to zero and so the above can
be reduced to:

∑ cov ( rˆ
t

t +1, k

l

⎛
⎞
, rˆt +1,l ) dt ,l − wt covt ⎜ rˆt +1,k , ∑ψ j yˆt +1+ j ⎟ = 0

⎛ covt ( rˆt +1,1 , rˆt +1,1 )

⎠
⎜⎜ covt ⎜ rˆt +1, K , ∑ψ yˆt +1+ j ⎟ ⎟⎟
j ≥0
⎝
⎠⎠
⎝

(B3)

Rearranging this gives:

⎛ covt ( rˆt +1,1 , rˆt +1,1 ) … covt ( rˆt +1,1 , rˆt +1,l ) ⎞
⎛ dt ,1 ⎞
⎜

This can be simplified with the following notation:
d = wt ∑ r ⋅∑ y ,r

In our first estimations, we restrict ourselves to the analysis of domestic and foreign currency
debt.

where

cov ( rˆt +1,2 , rˆt +1,1 )

cov ( rˆt +1,1 , rˆt +1,2 ) cov ( rˆt +1,2 , rˆt +1,2 )

We recall that the domestic and foreign innovation of returns is given by the following equations

and define Δs = Δst +1 − Et Δst +1 , π = π t +1 − Etπ t +1 , l = lt +1 − Et lt +1 , y = ∑ψ j yˆt +1+ j and denote
j ≥0

Cov( x, y ) = c( x, y ) and Var ( x) = v( x) . Expanding equation (B6) we get:
