On the Asset Market View of Exchange Rates

                                        ABSTRACT

If the asset market is complete then the difference between foreign and domestic agents' log
intertemporal marginal rates of substitution (IMRSs) equals the log change in the real exchange
rate. This equation is frequently used to argue that changes in real exchange rates reflect
differences between agents' required compensation for exposure to asset return uncertainty. We
show that the relative returns on frictionlessly traded assets are only reflected in the common
component of agents' IMRSs, not differences. Instead, when this equation does offer insights,
frictions in the goods market are the source of economic distinction between agents.

change rates.       It is now a dominant theoretical framework in the recent international asset

pricing literature and has been used to understand exchange rate determination, foreign ex-

change risk premia, and international risk sharing.               For a recent survey of this literature,

see Lustig and Verdelhan (2012).

   We oer a critique of this framework.              The dierence between agents' log IMRSs is

often interpreted as the dierence between their required compensation for exposure to the

uncertainty in asset returns. However, this economic interpretation does not account for any

dierence in units over which agents' IMRSs are expressed. When Eq. (1) holds, we show

that the foreign and domestic agents actually require the same, not dierent, compensation

for exposure to asset return uncertainty.

   Therefore, structural assumptions about preferences and goods market frictions are nec-

essary to interpret variation in real exchange rates as dierences between agents' IMRSs. For

example, suppose that the asset market is complete and agents in dierent economies have

the same consumption aggregators over individual goods. With these assumptions, frictions

in the goods market are the only source of economic distinction between agents, and the

amount of variation in the real exchange rate reects the degree to which this risk in the

goods market is not shared across these economies. However, there is an important observa-

tional equivalence problem. We show that the same real exchange rate behavior can result

if the asset market is complete and goods markets are frictionless, but agents have dierent

preferences over individual goods.         In this case, agents share risk perfectly.         Thus, armed

   1 In a distinct earlier literature, the asset market view of exchange rates referred to the role of asset
markets and capital mobility in exchange rate determination. This literature emphasized the importance of
the fact that nominal exchange rates and asset markets adjust much more quickly than goods markets. See,
for example, Dornbusch (1976), Frenkel (1976), Kouri (1976), and Mussa (1976).

Santa-Clara (2006); Lustig and Verdelhan (2006); Brennan and Xia (2006); Lustig and Verdelhan (2007);

only with asset returns, exchange rates, and aggregate consumption data, it is impossible to

dierentiate between models in which agents share risk perfectly and ones where they don't.

Although our paper is a critique, a positive message from it is that structural modeling is

helpful if it is specic about goods markets and preferences over disaggregated consumption,

and brings relevant evidence to bear.




1 The Asset Market View of Exchange Rates
To facilitate comparisons across economies, consider a frictionlessly traded basket of assets

and/or goods and services that serves as a common numeraire. In the domestic economy, let

Pd,t   be the number of units of this numeraire that can be traded for one unit of the domestic

representative agent's consumption basket of goods and services at time                          t.   Likewise, let   Pf,t
be the number of numeraire units that can be traded for one unit of the foreign agent's

consumption basket at time            t   in the foreign economy.

       The real domestic/foreign exchange rate,         et = Pf,t /Pd,t , is the price of a unit of the foreign
agent's consumption basket, expressed in units of the domestic agent's consumption basket.

Any frictionlessly traded numeraire yields the same real exchange rate. Let                            Xt   be the gross

change in the real exchange rate from time              t−1   to   t.   Then,



       Xt = et /et−1 = δd,t /δf,t ,         where      δd,t = Pd,t−1 /Pd,t       and       δf,t = Pf,t−1 /Pf,t .      (2)



The real exchange rate is constant if the composition of agents' consumption baskets is

identical, and they face the same prices for all goods and services (i.e., purchasing power

parity holds across these economies). Therefore, the real exchange rate only varies over time

if at least one of these conditions is violated.

       Consider an arbitrage-free set of        k   assets that can be frictionlessly traded across these
                η
economies. Let Rt denote the vector of gross returns on these assets, from time                               t−1   to   t,
denominated in units of our numeraire. Then the gross asset returns, denominated in units

of the domestic and foreign agents' consumption baskets, are given by



                               Rt = δd,t Rηt           and              R∗t = δf,t Rηt ,                              (3)



respectively.

       For concreteness (and without loss of generality), a portfolio of the assets themselves can

serve as our common numeraire, so long as its gross return is almost surely strictly positive.



                                                         2
Let   η   be a vector of portfolio weights for such a numeraire, in which case                  Rηt   is the vector of

gross asset returns relative to the gross return on this portfolio. Then                    δd,t   and   δf,t   equal the

gross return on this numeraire portfolio, denominated in units of the domestic and foreign

consumption baskets, respectively. That is,


                                                                           Rt            R∗
               Rt · η = δd,t ,         R∗t · η = δf,t ,         and              = Rηt = ∗ t ,                        (4)
                                                                          Rt · η        Rt · η

where    a · b denotes the dot product of vectors a and b.
      Let Md,t be the domestic agent's IMRS, between time t − 1                    and    t,   expressed over units
                                                                ∗
of her consumption basket of goods and services. Likewise, let Mf,t be the foreign agent's

IMRS over units of his consumption basket during this period. Since the agents can trade

the assets, their IMRSs must satisfy the well-known rst order (Euler) conditions

                                                             ∗ ∗
                                        E [Md,t Rt ] = 1 = E Mf,t Rt .                                                (5)



In Eq. (5),    1   is a vector of 1's and       E [·]   denotes expectation conditional on information

available at time     t−1       (for notational convenience, we drop the explicit dependence on the

time   t−1    information set).

      When expressed over units of our common numeraire, the agents' IMRSs must equal


                             η                                          η      ∗
                            Md,t = Md,t δd,t              and          Mf,t = Mf,t δf,t .                             (6)



The change of numeraire units in Eqs. (3) and (6) preserves agents' pricing of asset return

uncertainty, characterized by Eq. (5), since

                     η                                                              η
                    Md,t                                                           Mf,t

      Md,t Rt = Md,t δd,t Rηt = Md,t
                                 η
                                     Rηt                and
                                                                       ∗
                                                                      Mf,t R∗t = Mf,t
                                                                                   ∗
                                                                                      δf,t Rηt = Mf,t
                                                                                                  η
                                                                                                      Rηt .           (7)
                     | {z }                                                           | {z }
                           Rt                                                             R∗t


Therefore, the log dierence between agents' required compensation for exposure to asset

return uncertainty is captured by


                                    η         η         ∗
                                ln Mf,t − ln Md,t = ln Mf,t − ln Md,t − ln Xt .                                       (8)



Importantly, this dierence does not depend on the particular choice of frictionlessly traded

numeraire that is used as a common basis for comparison across agents, since any such




                                                           3
numeraire yields the same real exchange rate.

      According to the asset market view, when Eq. (1) holds, the change in the real exchange

rate reects the dierence between the foreign and domestic agents' required compensation
                                                                                  η      η
for exposure to asset return uncertainty. However, Eq. (1) holds when            Md,t = Mf,t    in Eq. (8),

so these agents actually require the same, not dierent, compensation for exposure to the

uncertainty in asset returns. Instead, the change in the real exchange rate simply reects the

dierence in units  dierent consumption baskets of goods and services, and/or dierent

prices for the components of those baskets  over which agents' IMRSs (and the asset returns)

are expressed. This point is our main critique of the asset market view of exchange rates.

      Thus, to draw conclusions from Eq. (1) about meaningful economic distinctions between

agents, we must make further assumptions about the underlying economic environment

beyond the asset market structure. In particular, as we show in Section 4, exchange rate

data, together with Eq. (1), can be used to draw important distinctions between domestic

and foreign agents if we further assume that they have the same consumption aggregators

over individual goods and there are goods market frictions.              However, regardless of any

additional assumptions about goods markets, it still remains that the foreign and domestic

agents' require the same compensation for exposure to asset return uncertainty whenever

Eq. (1) holds.



1.1 Stochastic Discount Factors (SDFs)
Eq. (1) also characterizes a change of units for a stochastic discount factor (SDF). An SDF

for   Rt   is dened as an almost surely strictly positive random variable,        Mt > 0,    such that



                                            1 = E [Mt Rt ] .                                              (9)


                          ∗                                      ∗
From Eq. (5),    Md,t   Mf,t
                        and  are examples of SDFs for Rt and Rt , respectively. From Eq. (7),
 η                     η
Md,t = Md,t δd,t and Mf,t      ∗
                          = Mf,t δf,t are both examples of SDFs for Rηt .
                                  η        η                            ∗
   Eq. (1) holds if and only if Md,t = Mf,t , in which case Md,t and Mf,t are the same SDF,

simply denominated in dierent units. That is, dropping the subscripts on agents' IMRSs,

Mt    is an SDF for   Rt = Xt R∗t   if and only   Mt∗ = Mt Xt   is an SDF for   R∗t ,   and vice versa.



1.2 Illustrative Example: Complete Asset Markets
Before closing out this section, we demonstrate how our critique applies to the special case

of complete asset markets, which is the canonical example upon which the asset market view


                                                     4
of exchange rates is based.

   A set of asset returns is a complete market for an agent if: (i) there are no events over

which the agent's IMRS varies, but the asset returns do not; and (ii) there is a unique SDF

within the space of SDFs that can be expressed as a function of those asset returns (or,

more precisely, there is a unique SDF within the space of SDFs that are measurable with

respect to the   σ -algebra       generated by those asset returns).           Thus, if the asset returns are

a complete market for both the foreign and domestic agents, then their IMRSs are equal

(when expressed over a common numeraire that is frictionlessly traded) and Eq. (1) holds.

   If the asset market is complete then we can explicitly characterize the agents' IMRSs.

Long (1990) shows that an SDF for             Rηt   is given by



 Mtη = (Rηt · θ ? )−1 ,                 θ ? = arg max E [ln (Rηt · θ)] ⇒ E (Rηt · θ ? )−1 Rηt = 1 .
                                                                                            
                           where                                                                             (10)
                                                    θ·1=1


Karatzas and Kardaras (2007) prove that this SDF always exists (whenever there is an SDF

that satises Eq. 9). Therefore, if the asset market is complete for the foreign and domestic

agents, then   Mtη   in Eq. (10) is the unique SDF for            Rηt ,   and their log IMRSs must equal

                    η
                ln Mf,t =ln Mtη                                                      η
                                                                                 ln Md,t =ln Mtη
             z     }|       {                                                z     }|       {
       ∗
   ln Mf,t = − ln (Rηt · θ ? ) − ln δf,t             and           ln Md,t = − ln (Rηt · θ ? ) − ln δd,t .   (11)
             |          {z            }                                      |          {z            }
                      − ln(R∗t ·θ ? )                                                   − ln(Rt ·θ ? )


   Recall that, according to the asset market view of exchange rates, the dierence between

agents' log IMRSs is economically interpreted as the dierence between their required com-

pensation for exposure to asset return uncertainty. However, this required compensation is

captured by    ln Mtη = − ln (Rηt · θ ? ),    which is common to both agents' log IMRSs. Instead,

any dierence between their IMRSs,            ln δd,t − ln δf,t = ln Xt , simply reects the dierent units
over which their IMRSs (and the asset returns) are expressed.




2 Economic Interpretation of SDFs in Ane Models
In this section we demonstrate how our critique applies to the large literature that uses

reduced-form ane models of two (or more) log SDFs to characterize and economically
                                                                                   3
interpret currency returns as dierences between agents' IMRSs.

  3 A few examples of papers that pursue this modeling approach include: Backus, Foresi, and Telmer
(2001); Brandt and Santa-Clara (2002); Bakshi, Carr, and Wu (2008); Lustig, Roussanov, and Verdelhan
(2011); and Lustig, Roussanov, and Verdelhan (2014).

   To begin, we extend our earlier notation to a setting with                      `≥2     dierent economies. Let

Xti denote the gross change in the ith real exchange rate (expressed in units of the domestic
consumption basket per unit of the consumption basket in the ith foreign economy). Let   Mt
       i
and Mt be SDFs that price the asset returns denominated in units of the domestic and ith
                                                       i
foreign consumption baskets, respectively. Let rt and rt denote the one-period continuously-

compounded real interest rates on default-free bank accounts in the domestic and ith foreign

economy, respectively.        Finally, let   X t , M ∗t ,     and   r ∗t   denote   (` − 1) × 1      vectors with    ith
          i
elements Xt ,   Mti , and   rti respectively.
   In this literature, the dynamics of SDFs for asset returns denominated in units of the                              `
dierent economies are frequently modeled as



 ln Mt = −rt−1 − λ εt − 12 λλ>                           ln M ∗t = −r ∗t−1 − Λ∗ εt −            1

   In the literature we critique, the reduced-form SDFs in Eq. (12) are often assumed to equal

the IMRSs of representative agents in the domestic and foreign economies.                           λ is economically
interpreted as the compensation that agents in the domestic economy require for exposure

to the vector of asset return shocks,           εt .   Likewise, the        ith   row of   Λ∗   is interpreted as the

prices of risk that agents in the ith foreign economy assign to these shocks. According to this

economic interpretation of Eqs. (12) and (13), both the volatility and expected excess return

on foreign currency investments reect heterogeneity across agents in dierent economies in

the compensation they require for exposure to these asset market shocks.

2.1 Example: Lustig, Roussanov, and Verdelhan (2014)
Lustig, Roussanov, and Verdelhan (2014) is a recent and representative example in the

literature that we critique.          They document that currency returns can be explained by a

small set of currency factors (i.e., dynamic long/short portfolios of currencies). To interpret

these empirical results, they provide a reduced-form ane model of agents' IMRSs that is

driven by a vector of           `+2   latent shocks,                εt .   Their model is of the form in Eqs. (12) and

(13), with

compensation for exposure to these local and global asset market shocks.



2.2 Critique Applied to Ane Models
To see how our critique applies to this literature, let                             Rηt denote the vector of gross returns,
denominated in units of our numeraire, on a set of                                 k non-redundant assets that are priced
by the SDFs in Eq. (12).             Then       Rit = δf,t Rηt             are these asset returns, denominated in the

consumption units of the ith foreign economy, where                                    δi,t = Pi,t /Pi,t−1 , and Pi,t    is the number

of numeraire units that can be traded for one unit of the representative agent's consumption

    4 For example, Lustig, Roussanov, and Verdelhan (2014, p. 537) state that Accounting for the variation
in expected currency excess returns across dierent currencies requires variation in the SDFs' exposures to
the common innovation. ... Lustig, Roussanov, and Verdelhan (2011) show that permanent heterogeneity
in loadings ...    is necessary to explain the variation in unconditional expected returns (why high interest
rate currencies tend not to depreciate on average), whereas the transitory heterogeneity in loadings ... is
necessary to match the variation in conditional expected returns (why currencies with currently high interest
rates tend to appreciate).




                                                                       7
basket at time     t   in the    ith    foreign economy. Likewise,                 Rt = δd,t Rηt = Xti Rit    are these asset

returns, denominated in domestic consumption units.

    For tractability, given the ane log SDFs in Eq. (12), the vector of log returns on these

assets are typically assumed to also be ane functions of the latent shocks,                                  εt .   If these log

asset returns span this vector of shocks, then we can invert this relationship and express

the shocks as ane functions of the log asset returns. Substituting this inversion back into

Eq. (12), the log SDFs can be expressed as ane functions of the log returns,



    ln Mt = c − Υ · ln Rt                and        ln Mti = ci − Υi · ln Rit ,             ∀i ∈ {1, . . . , ` − 1} ,        (15)



for some   c, ci , Υ,   and   Υi .     The change of units,         ln Xti = ln Mti − ln Mt ,         for each pair of SDFs

in Eq. (15) implies that



             ln Mti = ln Mt + ln Xti = c − Υ · ln Rt − 1 ln Xti + (1 − Υ · 1) ln Xti .
                                                               
                                                                                                                             (16)
                                              |      {z        }
                                                                          ln Rit

Comparing the expressions for              ln Mti   in Eqs. (15) and (16) give us



             ci = c ,            Υi = Υ ,           and         Υ · 1 = 1,              ∀i ∈ {1, . . . , ` − 1} .            (17)



    Therefore, the SDFs in Eq. (12) can be written equivalently as


                        ln M η                                                               ln M η
             z    }|t    {                                                        z    }|t    {
                         η                                                    i               η
     ln Mt = c − Υ · ln Rt − ln δd,t                      and             ln Mt = c − Υ · ln Rt − ln δi,t .                  (18)
               |        {z        }                                                 |        {z        }
                              −Υ·ln Rt                                                            −Υ·ln Rit


Again, contrary to the claims in this literature, the relative asset returns (including currency

returns) are only reected in the common component of these SDFs, which is                                             ln Mtη =
c − Υ · ln Rηt .   The dierence,         ln δd,t − ln δi,t = ln Xti ,        instead reects the dierent units used

to denominate the asset returns.

    To further explore ane models, note that                       c   can be characterized in terms of              Υ,   since


                                  Rηt   η                                                         η
                   1 = E e|c−Υ·ln                                       c = − ln k1 1 · E e−Υ·ln Rt Rηt .
                                                                                                    
                             {z }     R t              ⇒                                                                     (19)

                                  Mtη


Moreover, this characterization of             c   can be symmetrically expressed using the asset returns




                                                                8
denominated in the domestic and foreign consumption baskets, since


                                                                                η                 i
                   Υ·1=1             ⇒           e−Υ·ln Rt Rt = e−Υ·ln Rt Rηt = e−Υ·ln Rt Rit ,             ∀i .          (20)



       In many cases we can explicitly solve for                 c   and   Υ   in Eq. (18). To illustrate, suppose the

last asset is a default-free bank account, denominated in domestic consumption units, that

pays continuously-compounded interest                   rt−1 .   If the gross returns on the other            k−1     assets,

2.3 Implications of No-Arbitrage
The dynamics of short-term interest rates can also be included in models of the form in

Eq. (12), in which case the model will have no-arbitrage implications for the term structure

of interest rates in the domestic and foreign economies. However, Eq. (12) does not impose

any such overidentifying restrictions.

       A particularly well-known paper in this literature is Backus, Foresi, and Telmer (2001)

who characterize the (forward premium) anomaly in the context of ane models of the
                                                  5
term structure of interest rates.                    The restrictions they derive are not actually due to

       5 In contrast to much of the literature, Backus, Foresi, and Telmer (2001) are careful not to interpret the
SDFs in their model as the IMRSs of domestic and foreign representative agents.




                                                                 9
Eqs. (12) and (13), but instead reect an implicit spanning assumption. The intuition can

be understood as follows. Any dynamic no-arbitrage model of the term structure of interest

rates in two economies must have at least four assets: short- and long-term bonds in both

economies. With four assets, there are three relative returns to consider. However, Backus,

Foresi, and Telmer (2001) assume that those three relative returns are driven by only two

shocks, in which case one (or a portfolio) of the three assets must be redundant, since it

can be replicated by a combination of the other two. It is this redundancy, not the forward

premium anomaly or Eqs. (12) and (13), that is the source of the restrictions they derive.

    It is also important to recognize that Eq. (1) does not imply that a foreign currency return

is a redundant asset that can be replicated by a combination of other assets. For example,

Ahn (2004) provides a model in which shocks to real exchange rates are not completely

spanned by the shocks that drive bond returns denominated in local units. The model in
                                                                                 6
Lustig, Roussanov, and Verdelhan (2014) also has this feature.




3 Restrictions in Reduced-Form Models
Beyond the economic interpretation of SDFs, some papers in the literature we critique suggest

that the change of units in Eq. (1) also imposes restrictions on reduced-form models of

currency returns. It does not. In this section we show that the restrictions in these papers

are actually errors.



3.1 SDFs for Dierent Sets of Assets
Brennan and Xia (2006) test whether the change of units,                    ln X t = ln M ∗t − 1 ln Mt , holds for
SDFs,   Mt and M ∗t , that they estimate to only price domestic and foreign bonds, respectively.
However, this test is not motivated by theory, since the change of units only applies to SDFs

that price the same set of assets. To demonstrate this point with a simple counterexample,

note that    ln Mt = −rt−1       and    ln M ∗t = −r ∗t−1       are log SDFs that only price domestic and

foreign one-period default-free bank account returns denominated in local units. However,

if the exchange rate is not determined prior to time                t   (i.e., it is stochastic), then

   6 In Lustig, Roussanov, and Verdelhan (2014), a single shock, ε`+2 , drives all of the variation in the       `−1
                                                                  t
exchange rates that is independent of changes in the term structure of interest rates in those economies. In
their model, the short-term interest rate in the     ith   foreign economy, rti , is driven by εit and ε`+1
                                                                                                        t   , while the
                                                             `        `+1                   i        `
interest rate in the domestic economy, rt , is driven by εt and εt        . The shocks εt and εt also drive time-
              i                 `+1                                         i             i
variation in λi and λ` , while εt   also drives variation in λ`+1 , λ`+2 , λ`+1 , and λ`+2 . Given this dependence,
the term structure of interest rates in each economy is determined by no-arbitrage, and is driven by the same
two shocks that drive short-term interest rates in that economy.

3.2 Minimum Variance Projections
Let    β · Rt   be the linear projection of the domestic representative agent's IMRS onto the

asset returns denominated in domestic consumption units.                                  Likewise, let       β ∗ · R∗t   be the

linear projection of the foreign representative agent's IMRS onto the asset returns in foreign

consumption units. Brandt, Cochrane, and Santa-Clara (2006, p. 675) claim that      β · Rt Xt is
                              ∗
always in the linear span of Rt , which implies that Eq. (1) generalizes to incomplete markets
                                                                                                      7
if we replace agents' IMRSs with these minimum variance projections.                                          In general, this

claim is not correct. Instead, it is        β · Rt /Xt ,     not   β · R t Xt ,      that is always in the linear span
    ∗               8
of Rt = Rt /Xt .        If the asset market is incomplete then, for any given                             β    there does not
                  ∗
generally exist β       such that
                                      ∗
                                    β ·    R∗t   = β · R t Xt ,    and therefore,



                                     ln Xt 6= ln β ∗ · R∗t − ln β · Rt .                                                     (26)



3.3 Incomplete Markets
Brandt and Santa-Clara (2002) provide a reduced-form model of dierent SDFs,                                      Mt   and   Mt∗ ,
such that

                                    ln Ξt = ln Mt∗ − ln Mt − ln Xt 6= 0.                                                     (27)


                                                                             Mt∗ ,          E Ξ−1   = 1.9
                                                                                                 
However, they claim that       Ξt    is independent of            Mt   and           with      t
      This claim violates no arbitrage because it implies that their model assigns two dierent

returns to the same default-free domestic currency bank account. To prove this result, note

that   Mt∗ R∗t = Mt Ξt Rt .    Therefore         Mt    and   Mt Ξt     must both price the asset returns,                    Rt ,
including a default-free domestic currency bank account,



                                          E Mt = e−rt−1 = E Mt Ξt .

   7 Lustig and Verdelhan (2012, p. 395) also make this claim in their survey chapter.
   8 In the appendix of their paper, Brandt, Cochrane, and Santa-Clara (2006) provide a specic example
with complete asset markets in which      β · Rt Xt   is in the linear span of    R∗t .   However, this result does not hold
true in general if markets are incomplete (which is the relevant case required to prove their desired result).
   9 See Eq. (24) in Brandt and Santa-Clara (2002, p. 176). They state that the key insight of our model
is that when markets are incomplete, the volatility of the exchange rate is not uniquely determined by the
domestic and foreign stochastic discount factors. ... If markets are incomplete, the volatility of the exchange
rate can contain an element that is orthogonal to the priced sources of risk in both countries. ... To capture
this excess volatility, we specify a stochastic process for the degree of market incompleteness.

However, if   Ξt   is independent of        Mt   and   Mt∗ ,   then by Jensen's inequality,

3.4 Market Completeness in Reduced-Form Models
In reduced-form models of asset returns, there is a unique SDF (or, equivalently, a unique

pricing measure) if and only if any contingent claim on the assets can be exactly replicated by
                                               11
a (dynamic) portfolio of the assets.                Since reduced-form models focus exclusively on asset

returns, the SDFs in these models can only be unique within the space of SDFs that are

measurable with respect to the             σ -algebra generated by these returns.       The binomial tree and

Black-Scholes-Merton models are perhaps the best known examples of reduced-form models
                                                       12
with SDFs that are unique in this sense.

    While the unique SDFs in these reduced-form models are useful for pricing and hedging

contingent claims (e.g., options), they do not necessarily equal the IMRS of a representative

agent in Eq. (1). For example, when there is a unique reduced-form SDF for the asset returns

denominated in domestic consumption units, it can be expressed as                       ln Mt = − ln (Rt · θ ? ).
However, the domestic agent's IMRS could be        Md,t = ζt Mt , where ζt is a random variable
that is independent of Rt with E [ζt ] = 1. In this case, Md,t is an SDF for Rt , but the agent's

IMRS varies over states of the world, captured by ζt , that the asset returns do not (i.e., Md,t

is not measurable with respect to the σ -algebra generated by Rt ).

    Thus, an SDF in a reduced-form model can only be economically interpreted as the IMRS

of a representative agent under the additional assumption that there are no events (i.e., states

of the world) over which the agent's IMRS varies, but the asset returns in the model do not.

This additional assumption is common in more structural models (with agents) because it

makes them much easier to solve. However, it is not a common assumption in reduced-form

  10 Similarly, Anderson, Hammond, and Ramezani (2010) show that, in the special case of an ane setting,
the assumptions in Brandt and Santa-Clara (2002) are infeasible.             Eq. (29) illustrates that the internal
inconsistency (i.e., the arbitrage opportunity) applies more generally, beyond the specic ane structure.
  11 See the seminal work by Harrison and Kreps (1979) and Harrison and Pliska (1981, 1983).
  12 For details on the binomial tree model, see Cox, Ross, and Rubinstein (1979). For the Black-Scholes-
Merton model, see Black and Scholes (1973) and Merton (1973). The discrete-time (continuous state space)
model in Eqs. (12) and (13) is an example of a reduced-form model that does not have a unique SDF; for
example, Long's SDF in Eq. (10) is another, dierent SDF that is also consistent with the asset return
dynamics. However, the continuous-time limit of Eq. (12) is a continuous diusion and in that case,           Υ   in
Eq. (18) is equal to   θ?   in Eq. (10).

models (outside of the international asset pricing literature).                    In fact, the primary appeal

of reduced-form models is that one is free to model the relative returns on a subset of the

assets available to trade, and can be agnostic about any variation in agents' IMRSs that is

independent of the returns on those (or any other) assets.




4 Models with Agents and Risk Sharing
We now turn to a discussion of models in which there are two agents, who reside, respectively,

in the domestic and foreign economies. In Section 4.1 we highlight the model elements that

are particularly relevant for our subsequent discussion. In Section 4.2 we characterize the

conditions under which variation in the real exchange rate directly reects imperfect risk

sharing. In Section 4.3 we show that asset returns can be informative about the amount of

risk shared between agents, but not about the amount of unshared risk. Finally, in Section

4.4, we work with a simple model motivated by Backus and Smith (1993), to show that

fundamentally dierent models of real exchange rates can be observationally equivalent at

the level of aggregate consumption data.



4.1 Model Highlights
We describe an economy with two countries (domestic and foreign), each with a represen-

tative agent. Utility is dened over           n   individual consumption goods, which are indexed by

j = 1, 2, . . . , n.   All goods are perishable and both agents are price takers. Time is discrete,

and indexed by         t,   but we suppress date subscripts unless strictly necessary.

    The domestic agent has an instantaneous level of utility



                                               u[cd (c1d , c2d , · · · , cnd )],                          (30)



where   cjd   is her consumption of good          j , cd (·)   is a homogeneous of degree one quasi-concave

function of its arguments, and            u   is a monotonic function with standard properties.           The

foreign agent has an instantaneous level of utility



                                               u[cf (c1f , c2f , · · · , cnf )],                          (31)



where   cjf   is his consumption of good           j,   and     cf (·)   is a homogeneous of degree one quasi-

concave function of its arguments.              For convenience we assume that the utility functions




                                                               13
over the aggregate are the same, but that the consumption aggregators,                                 cd   and    cf   may be

dierent.

   Both economies are cashless and use good 1 as the numeraire, which is assumed to be

frictionlessly traded.          Our model would have the same implications for the real exchange

rate if we chose dierent numeraires. Goods markets meet sequentially. Goods may or may

not be frictionlessly traded, so prices for those goods may dier across the economies. Price

dierences might be the result of physical trading costs (in the extreme, some goods might be

nontraded) or might stem from price discrimination by producers. The domestic and foreign

prices of good       j   are, respectively,   Pdj   and   Pfj .   For any good that is frictionlessly traded, its

price must be the same in both countries:



                                                          Pdj = Pfj .                                                        (32)



Given that good 1 is the numeraire,                 Pd1 = Pf1 = 1.

that lifetime utility is additively time separable, with a discount factor,                                 0 < β < 1,         so
      j
that Md,t    =    β[∂uc (cd,t )/∂cjd,t ]/[∂uc (cd,t−1 )/∂cjd,t−1 ]. However, for most of this section, lifetime
utility can take on a number of dierent forms with the same results going through.

   We assume that both agents have access to a nancial market in which                                     k   assets, priced

in units of the numeraire, are frictionlessly traded.                     In any model where the asset market
                   1      1
is complete       Md,t = Mf,t .     This follows from the fact that an economy in which the asset

market is complete is equivalent to one in which there is a complete set of state-contingent

claims. In such an economy, both agents optimally set, on a state-by-state basis, the IMRS

between units of the numeraire at              t    and   t−1       equal to the price, at    t − 1,        of a claim to a

unit of the numeraire in each possible state at time                     t.   This result is standard and does not

depend on details of the utility function or the rest of the economic environment, such as

the production structure. In a more general model where the asset market is incomplete,
                                                                                      1       1
there will be some time periods or states of the world in which                      Md,t 6= Mf,t .     We nd it useful
                      1     1
to dene    Ξt =     Mf,t /Md,t , with deviations of           Ξt   from 1 reecting the degree of asset market

incompleteness.

   In a model where households are price takers, the marginal rate of substitution between

good   j   and good       1   is optimally set equal to the price of good              j,   given that good             1   is the
                                                                             j     1
numeraire. Consequently, for the domestic and foreign agents, respectively, Md,t /Md,t                                          =
 j     j          j     1      j     j
Pd,t /Pd,t−1 and Mf,t /Mf,t = Pf,t /Pf,t−1 .



                                                               14
    Thus, in general, the following equilibrium condition holds:


                                              j                   j     j
                                             Mf,t               (Pf,t /Pf,t−1 )
                                              j          = Ξt     j     j         .                        (33)
                                             Md,t               (Pd,t /Pd,t−1 )

If trade in good       j is frictionlessor in other words, if purchasing power parity (PPP) holds
                         j       j
for good   j,   then   Pd,t = Pf,t  for all t, and the price change terms drop out of the equation.


Denition. The domestic and foreign agents share risk perfectly if Mf,t
                                                                    j      j
                                                                        = Md,t for all j , t.
    Colacito and Croce (2011, p. 156) also adopt this denition of perfect risk sharing, which

states that the domestic and foreign agents equate IMRSs over all individual goods and

services at every point in time. It is not equivalent to asset markets being complete, which

would only imply that        Ξt = 1       for all   t.    Nor is it equivalent to an allocation that coincides

with the solution to a social planner's problem that respects goods market frictions. In either

of these situations, risk sharing will be as good as it can be, but any market frictions that
                                    j            j
result in a wedge between          Pd,t   and   Pf,t ,    for some     j,   prevent IMRSs over some goods being

equated. Our denition means that risk sharing is perfect in a model with complete asset

markets and frictionless trade in all goods.

    IMRSs may also be dened over consumption baskets rather than individual consumption

goods. We let     Md,t denote the domestic agent's IMRS dened over units of her consumption
                  ∗
basket, and      Mf,t denote the foreign agent's IMRS, dened over units of his consumption

basket. We use an asterisk to denote the foreign agent's IMRS because the foreign agent

may have dierent preferences over individual goods than the domestic agent. This would

imply that the two IMRSs are expressed in dierent units. Given that the agents' baskets

are homogeneous of degree one aggregates of their consumption of individual goods, the

prices of these baskets (in some common numeraire) may be written as homogenous of

degree one functions of the individual prices (in the same numeraire) faced by these agents:

Pd = Hd (Pd1 , Pd2 , · · · ) and Pf = Hf (Pf1 , Pf2 , · · · ), with the functional forms of Hd (·) and Hf (·)
being related to the functions cd (·) and cf (·) (see Varian, 1984). The subscripts on these

functions allow for the possibility that the agents' preferences dier. At the level of aggregate

consumption the equation that corresponds to Eq. (33) is

                                                      ∗
                                                     Mf,t
                                                          = Ξt Xt ,                                        (34)

where   Xt = et /et−1     and   et = Pf,t /Pd,t .


                                                                15
4.2 Risk Sharing and Variation in Real Exchange Rates
When agents have the same consumption aggregator,                     Hd = Hf = H ,    the real exchange rate
               1    2                 1      2                                                      j      j
is et = H(Pf,t   , Pf,t , · · · )/ H(Pd,t , Pd,t , · · · ). If goods markets are frictionless then Pd,t = Pf,t
for all j , t. Therefore, if agents have the same consumption aggregator and goods markets

are frictionless, et = 1 and Xt = 1 for all t. If we observe real exchange rate variation, it

necessarily implies that either markets for some goods are not frictionless or agents have

dierent consumption aggregators (or both).

      Does a variable real exchange rate, by itself, directly reect imperfect risk sharing?

Brandt, Cochrane, and Santa-Clara (2006) argue very strongly that the answer is always yes.

Table 1 summarizes our answer to this question, and as the table indicates, it depends on

underlying assumptions about the economic environment. The answer is yes if we assume

that asset markets are complete, and that agents have identical consumption aggregators.

With these assumptions,             Ξt = 1   and variation in    Xt   (due to variation in the real exchange

rate,  et ) can only happen if there are goods market frictions that drive wedges between
 j      j           j    j
Pd,t /Pd,t−1  and Pf,t /Pf,t−1 for some j . The existence of such wedges, in turn, necessarily

implies imperfect risk sharing.

      Under any of the other combinations of assumptions shown in Table 1, however, the

answer is no. For example, in the northeast corner of the table, asset markets are assumed

to be complete, but preferences over goods dier (Hd               6= Hf ).   In this case, perfect risk sharing
                                                                                          j
and real exchange rate variation are compatible, because we can have                     Md,t = M jf,t   for all   j,
                            ∗
t,   even when   Md,t 6=   Mf,t .


                                                           Nature of
                                                     Consumption Aggregators
                        Asset Markets                Identical             Dierent

                                     Complete            Yes                   No
                                    Incomplete           No                    No


        Table 1: Does a variable real exchange rate directly reect imperfect risk sharing?


      In the bottom row of the table the answer is also no. When asset markets are incomplete,

or, more precisely, when            Ξt 6= 1   for some   t,   then risk sharing is imperfect regardless of

the behavior of the real exchange rate.              For example, goods markets could be frictionless
                j            j
(implying that Pd,t    =    Pf,t for allj , t) and preferences over goods could be identical (with the
                                                                                     j    j

for some   t.
   To summarize, there is no direct connection between risk sharing and real exchange rate

variation except in models where asset markets are complete and agents have identical con-

sumption aggregators. In that case, goods market frictions are the only source of dierence

between agents' IMRSs.



4.3 Asset Prices and Unshared Risks
In contrast to our discussion in the previous section, Brandt, Cochrane, and Santa-Clara

(2006) argue very strongly that real exchange rate variation is always informative about

risk sharing. In fact, they conclude that because real exchange rate variation is small com-

pared to Hansen and Jagannathan (1991) bounds on the volatility of domestic and foreign

SDFs, domestic and foreign marginal utility growths must be highly correlated, and risk

sharing must be better than you think. On page 673, Brandt, Cochrane, and Santa-Clara

(2006) emphasize that their conclusion is drawn by only using data on asset returns and real

exchange rates:


      Yet the conclusion is hard to escape. Our calculation uses only price data, and

      no quantity data or economic modeling (utility functions, income or productivity

      shock processes, and so forth). A large degree of international risk sharing is an

      inescapable logical conclusion of Eq. (1), a reasonably high equity premium (over

      1%, as we show below), and the basic economic proposition that price ratios

      measure marginal rates of substitution.


To understand why Brandt, Cochrane, and Santa-Clara (2006) draw this dierent conclusion,

consider a version of their quantitative risk sharing index, applied to the logarithms of the
                                ∗                            ∗
IMRSs in our structural model (mf,t                    = ln Mf,t     and  md,t = ln Md,t ). The index is        based on
                 ∗                                                                         ∗            13
the variance of mf,t        − md,t    relative to the sum of           the variances of mf,t and md,t :


                                                             var(m∗f,t − md,t )
                                         RSI = 1 −                                  .                                (35)
                                                           var(m∗f,t ) + var(md,t )

Given our discussion in Section 4.2, it is clear that to base a risk sharing measure on                              RSI,
one must assume that preferences across goods are identical across locations. In other words,

 13 The index is the same as the correlation between                 m∗f t   and   mdt   when they have the same variance,
because   RSI =   2 cov(m∗f t , mdt )/[var(m∗f t )   + var(mdt )].



                                                                17
one has to rule out the second column of Table 1 to make the calculation meaningful. This

unstated assumption is implicit in their calculation.

    Brandt, Cochrane, and Santa-Clara (2006) appeal to Hansen-Jagannathan bounds in

order to avoid structurally modeling                      m∗f,t and md,t . In           particular, they note that using
                                                           ∗
asset market data they can project                       Mf,t  and Md,t onto            common vectors of asset returns

(denominated in real foreign and domestic currency, respectively).                                  We denote the logs of

these projections as        m̂∗f,t = ln M̂f,t
                                            ∗                                                 ∗
                                                and m̂d,t = ln M̂d,t . If we assume that var(mf,t ) ≥

var(m̂∗f,t )   and   var(md,t ) ≥ var(m̂d,t ) then we can put a lower bound on RSI:14

                                                                     var(m∗f,t − md,t )
                                        RSI ≥ RSI = 1 −                                       .                                   (36)
                                                                   var(m̂∗f t ) + var(m̂d,t )

    Of course, m∗f,t and md,t remain in the numerator in Eq. (36). In our model m∗f,t − md,t =
ξt + xt , where ξt = ln Ξt and xt = ln Xt . We can treat xt as measurable without a model,
given data on consumer price indices and the nominal exchange rate. But ξt is not directly

observable. To get around this issue Brandt, Cochrane, and Santa-Clara (2006) again appeal

to the projections,           m̂∗f,t   and   m̂d,t ,   and argue that       m̂∗f t − m̂d,t = xt   always holds, even when
                         15
m∗f,t   − md,t 6= xt .        Therefore, they use the following risk sharing measure:


                                                                           var(xt )
                                         RSIBCS = 1 −                                      .                                      (37)
                                                                var(m̂∗f,t ) + var(m̂d,t )

The advantage of Brandt, Cochrane, and Santa-Clara's measure is that                                 m̂∗f,t , m̂d,t   and    xt   can

be constructed using nothing more than data on asset returns and real exchange rates, and

a minimal appeal to asset pricing theory in forming the projections. The problem, however,

is that, unlike       RSI, RSIBCS is not a lower bound for RSI. To make RSIBCS meaningful as a
lower bound         for RSI we have to assume that asset markets are complete, so that ξt = 0. In

other words, we have to rule out the second column                                 and the second row of Table 1.
    One interpretation of              RSIBCS     is that   var(xt )/[var(m̂∗f,t )+var(m̂d,t )] = 1−RSIBCS               provides

an upper bound on the amount of risk that is not shared due only to goods market frictions.

Of course, this calculation still requires that we assume away preference dierences across

the agents. It also abstracts from any covariance there might be between                                 xt   and     ξt .
    Clearly, however,            RSIBCS      is silent on the amount of risk that is not shared due to asset

  14 While     var(M ∗f,t ) ≥ var(M̂f,t
                                    ∗
                                        ) and var(M d,t ) ≥ var(M̂d,t ), it does not necessarily follow that var(m∗f,t ) ≥
var(m̂∗f,t ) and   var(md,t ) ≥ var(m̂d,t ). This assumption is useful for intuition, but our argument does not
hinge on it.
  15 As we showed in Section 3.2, in general              m̂∗f,t − m̂d,t 6= xt .


                                                                    18
market incompleteness (the            ξt   component).      This issue brings us back to a problem we

highlighted in the section on reduced form models. These models are silent about dierences

between agents. Consistent with our main message in Sections 13, asset returns, alone, can

provide useful information about how much risk is shared (via Hansen-Jagannathan bounds),

but any measure of the degree of risk sharing also requires a measure of the amount of

unshared risk. Likewise, any measure of the correlation between agents' IMRSs also requires

a measure of     ξt .   Of course, one is always free to introspect, as Brandt, Cochrane, and Santa-

Clara (2006) do in Sec. 3.5 of their paper, on how much unshared risk seems reasonable.

Our view is that this introspection is merely speculative if additional data and theory are not

brought into the picture. Additionally, this introspection is not informed by exchange rates

and applies equally well to agents living in the same economy, who face the same prices.



4.4 Observational Equivalence
In this section, we use a more specic model to highlight the fact that fundamentally dierent

models of real exchange rates can be observationally equivalent at the level of aggregate

consumption data. The model is similar to the one in Backus and Smith (1993), in being

an endowment economy, with two agents, two periods, and two goods. As above, we allow

preferences across individual goods to vary across agents in the two economies. The utility

function,       u, is logarithmic in the consumption aggregate, while the consumption aggregators
are   cd (c1d , c2d ) = (c1d )θd (c2d )1−θd and cf (c1f , c2f ) = (c1f )θf (c2f )1−θf . Given these assumptions, it is
straightforward to solve for the dynamics of the real exchange rate for a number of dierent

variants of the model, as shown in the Online Appendix.

      When assets markets are complete, representative agents in the two economies have

dierent preferences over two individual goods, and trade in goods is frictionless, we have



                             ln (cd,t /cd,t−1 ) = θd ln G1t + (1 − θd ) ln G2t ,     and                       (38a)

                             ln (cf,t /cf,t−1 ) = θf ln G1t + (1 − θf ) ln G2t .                               (38b)



Here, G1t and G2t are, respectively, the gross growth rates of the global endowments of goods
1 and 2. Models of this type, which emphasize the role of dierent preferences over individual
                                                                                                      16
goods, have been important workhorses in the modern exchange rate literature.

      Consider an alternative model, in which assets markets are complete, representative

 16 See, for example, Stockman (1980), Bekaert (1996), Stathopoulos (2017), or Colacito, Croce, Ho, and
Howard (2018).




                                                          19
agents in two economies have identical preferences over the two goods, good                               1 being friction-
lessly traded, but good          2   being nontraded. Then we have


                                                                                 2
                                 ln (c̃d,t /c̃d,t−1 ) = θ ln G̃1t + (1 − θ) ln g̃dt ,    and                                 (39a)

                                ln (c̃f,t /c̃f,t−1 ) = θ ln G̃1t + (1 − θ) ln g̃f2t .                                       (39b)



Here   θ   is the weight that the domestic and foreign agents have on good                                1   in their utility

functions, c̃d,t and c̃f,t are the aggregate consumption levels                         in the domestic and foreign
              1                                                                                             2
countries, G̃t is the growth rate of the global endowment of                            good   1,   and   g̃dt     and   g̃f2t   are,

respectively, the growth rates of the endowments of good 2                              in the domestic and foreign

economies. Models that emphasize simple trade frictions have also played a prominent role
                                                      17
in the modern exchange rate literature.

   The two models are observationally equivalent for the real exchange rate when they are

observationally equivalent with respect to aggregate consumption. As an example, we can

specify the stochastic processes for the endowments so that



                          G̃1t = G1t ,                                                                                       (40a)

                           2
                               = (θd − θ) ln G1t + (1 − θd ) ln G2t / (1 − θ) ,
                                                                  
                      ln g̃d,t                                                                      and                     (40b)

                           2
                               = (θf − θ) ln G1t + (1 − θf ) ln G2t / (1 − θ) .
                                                                  
                      ln g̃f,t                                                                                               (40c)



With these assumptions, the two models have the same consumption growth rates and real

exchange rate:



                   ln Xt = ln (cd,t /cd,t−1 ) − ln (cf,t /cf,t−1 ) ,
                         = (θd − θf ) ln G1t − ln G2t = (1 − θ) ln g̃d,t
                                                                     2          2
                                                                                   
                                                                         − ln g̃f,t   .                                          (41)



The implication of this example is that an econometrician would not be able to discern which

mechanism is more relevant without looking at consumption and endowments at the level

of individual goods.        The two models are also very dierent in terms of risk sharing.                                       In

one model, risk is shared perfectly, and only global endowments matter. When the global

endowment of good           1    rises faster than that of good              2   and the foreign agent puts more
                                                                                                              18
weight on good     1,   its relative abundance means the real exchange rate falls.                                 In the other

  17 See, for example, for example, Backus and Smith (1993), Tesar (1993), Stockman and Tesar (1995) or
Ready, Roussanov, and Ward (2017).
  18 In fact, this model is equivalent to a model of a single representative agent whose preference weight is a
weighted average of   θd   and   θf .   The equilibrium price of good    2   is identical. The real exchange rate can be



                                                             20
model, risk sharing is imperfect when the endowment growth rates for good                        2   dier across

countries. If the foreign agent's endowment of good             2   grows faster, this makes his basket

relatively abundant, and the real exchange rate falls.

    It should also be clear, of course, that if one were to estimate these structural models

using only the pricing equations expressed in terms of consumption aggregates, it would be

impossible to distinguish between model variants in which (i) asset markets are complete

or incomplete, (ii) agents have the same or dierent preferences over individual goods, and

(iii) trade in goods is frictionless or not. A direct test of the model based on Eq. (34), à la

Backus and Smith (1993) would face the same problem.

    This is not to say that it is impossible to distinguish between models with imperfect

or perfect risk sharing. We simply have to look beyond their implications for asset pricing

equations and the joint behavior of aggregate consumption and exchange rates to nd their

predictions for individual goods or categories of goods. While this is not possible in cases

where only the behavior of the consumption aggregate is modeledfor example, Verdelhan

(2010), Colacito and Croce (2011), or Bansal and Shaliastovich (2013)it is possible for

the models cited above, in which preference dierences are specied over individual tradable

goods, or in which there are specic trade frictions over some goods.




5 Conclusion
Hansen and Jagannathan (1991) oer a powerful tool for constructing a lower bound on the

variation of all agents' IMRSs. Their lower bound is constructed from a reduced-form SDF,

which can be thought of as a common component of all agents' IMRSs, and relies only on

asset return data and the assumption of no-arbitrage. Unfortunately, reduced-form SDFs,

combined with asset return and exchange rate data, cannot be used in the same way to

identify economically meaningful dierences between agents' IMRSs.

    Our positive message is that structural models  with explicit assumptions about prefer-

ences over goods, goods market frictions, or asset market imperfections  are necessary, and

useful, to address specic questions about real exchange rate determination and risk sharing.

We are certainly not the rst to recognize this point. An early example is Backus and Smith

(1993), who examine the possibility that non-traded goods may account for several striking

features of international macroeconomic data. In order to focus on this friction in the goods

replicated by dening it as the relative price of two dierent baskets of good   1   and good   2.   See the Online
Appendix.




                                                     21
market, they assumed away frictions in the asset market (frictionless asset trading and com-

plete markets). Their approach is in line with our main point. When the asset market view

of exchange rates holds, variation in the real exchange rate only reects frictions and/or

preferences dierences in the goods market. It does not reect heterogeneity across agents

in dierent economies in the compensation for risk they require to own various assets such

as currencies.

Online Appendix
In this appendix we outline an example of a full-edged model of an endowment economy

that is consistent with the discussion in Section 4 of the paper.                        The model is based on

Backus and Smith (1993), and we use it to illustrate how aggregate consumption levels and

the real exchange rate are jointly determined in equilibrium.

     To make our notation compact we dene the                      n × 1 vectors cd = (c1d , c2d , · · · , cnd ), cf =
(c1f , c2f , · · · , cnf ), P d = (1, Pd2 , · · · , Pdn ) and P f = (1, Pf2 , · · · , Pfn ). We use a version of the
model in which there are two periods, with time indexed by t = 0, 1. In the most general

version of the model, asset markets are assumed to be incomplete, but we also explore a

complete markets version of the model, as well as one with specic assumptions about the

utility functions and consumption aggregators.

     We assume that there are          k   assets with    k×1       random payo vector           Z(ω)    in period 1,

where    ω∈Ω     represents the state of the world in period 1, which has probability                       π(ω).   We

assume that     k is   smaller than the number of states of the world, which is assumed to be

nite. The     k×1     price vector for these assets in period 0 is              P Z.   The payos and prices of

the assets are measured in units of good 1.

     The domestic agent chooses            cd,0 , {cd,1 (ω)}ω∈Ω ,   and   ad   to maximize

                                                      X
                                  u[cd (cd,0 )] + β         u{cd [cd,1 (ω)]}π(ω) ,                                  (42)
                                                      ω∈Ω


subject to

                                     P d,0 · cd,0 + P Z · ad = P d,0 · y d,0 ,                                      (43)


                     P d,1 (ω) · cd,1 (ω) = P d,1 (ω) · y d,1 (ω) + Z(ω) · ad ,          ω ∈ Ω.                     (44)


Here    0 < β < 1, cd,0      is the agent's consumption vector at time 0,                 y d,0   is an   n×1   vector

of her endowments of the goods at time 0,               cd,1 (ω)    are her plans for future consumption (in

every possible state of the world),  y d,1 (ω) are her future endowments (in every possible state
of   the world), and ad is a k × 1 vector whose ith element is her net purchases of asset i.

      Similarly, the foreign agent chooses cf,0 , {cf,1 (ω)}ω∈Ω , and af to maximize

                                                      X
                                  u[cf (cf,0 )] + β         u{cf [cf,1 (ω)]}π(ω) ,                                  (45)
                                                      ω∈Ω

                                     P f,0 · cf,0 + P Z · af = P f,0 · y f,0 .                                  (46)


                     P f,1 (ω) · cf,1 (ω) = P f,1 (ω) · y f,1 (ω) + Z(ω) · af ,          ω ∈ Ω.                 (47)


    For simplicity, we assume that each good is either frictionlessly traded across economies

Denition.       A competitive equilibrium is a set of vectors of quantities              cd,0 , cf,0 , {cd,1 (ω)}ω∈Ω ,

the market clearing conditions are satised. The law of one price must hold for any good

Complete Asset Markets
When asset markets are complete we can assume that there is a complete set of state con-

tingent claims. That is, we can assume that there are                     k states of the world (just as there
are   k   assets) and that the payo on asset           i   in state   ω = i is 1 and is zero otherwise.19 This
means that Eqs. (55) and (58) are equivalent to



                                                     PZ λd = µd ,                                                        (66)



                                                     PZ λf = µf ,                                                        (67)


where     µd = [µd (1), . . . , µd (k)]   and    µf = [µf (1), . . . , µf (k)].           This means that when asset

markets are complete we have
                                                      µd   µf
                                                         =    .                                                          (68)
                                                      λd   λf
Consequently, when asset markets are complete, we have the result that                                  Ξ(ω) = 1    for all   ω,

                                                Mfj (ω)

                                                Mdj (ω)

for any frictionlessly traded good, and

                                                                 (ω)/Pf,0
                                                        =                    ,                                           (70)
                                            Mdj (ω)          j
                                                            Pd,1      j

Z whose ith row is Z(i)0 .       If asset markets are complete the matrix                 Z   is invertible.   This means that
P̃Z = (Z −1 )0 PZ is the price   vector corresponding to a set of state contingent claims that can be formed as
portfolios of the original assets. The contingent claim for state        ω   is equivalent to a portfolio of the original
assets with the portfolio weights being given by the        ω th   column of     Z −1 .

Price Indices and the Real Exchange Rate
Given a particular set of prices for the individual goods, we can solve the domestic agent's

static expenditure minimization problem



                                 min P d · cd         subject to       cd = cd (cd ) .                              (71)
                                  cd,1


Because   cd (·) is a homogenous of degree one function, minimized expenditure is equal to
Pd cd where Pd = Hd (P d ), with Hd (·) also being homogenous of degree one in its arguments,
and having a form related to the function cd (·) (see Varian, 1984). Similarly, the foreign

price index is Pf = Hf (P f ). Since all prices are measured in the same numeraire, the real

exchange rate is e ≡ Pf /Pd .

    In the special case where cd (·) = cf (·), we have Hd (·) = Hf (·). If, additionally, all

goods are frictionlessly traded, e = 1. If preferences dier across countries and all goods are
                                                                                     j    j
frictionlessly traded, variation in the real exchange rate can arise even though Pd = Pf for

all j .



Aggregate IMRSs
Eqs. (53) and (54) imply


                                                 dcd (cd,0 )
                              uc [cd (cd,0 )][               · cd,0 ] = λd [cd,0 · P d,0 ],
                                                   dcd,0

                             dcd [cd,1 (ω)]
      βuc {cd [cd,1 (ω)]}[                  · cd,1 (ω)]π(ω) = [cd,1 (ω) · P d,1 (ω)]µd (ω) ,               ω ∈ Ω.
                              dcd,1 (ω)
Because   cd,0 · P d,0 = cd,0 Pd,0 , cd,1 (ω) · P d,1 (ω) = cd,1 (ω) · Pd,1 (ω),         and   cd (·)   is homogenous of

degree 1, this means we can rewrite these two Eqs. as



                                             uc [cd (cd,0 )] = Pd,0 λd ,

                           βuc {cd [cd,1 (ω)]}π(ω) = Pd,1 (ω)µd (ω) ,               ω ∈ Ω.

It follows that the IMRS over aggregate consumption for the domestic agent is


                                     uc {cd [cd,1 (ω)]}   Pd,1 (ω) µd (ω)
                      Md (ω) ≡ β                        =                 ,               ω ∈ Ω.                    (72)
                                       uc [cd (cd,0 )]     Pd,0 λd π(ω)



                                                            30
Similarly, for the foreign agent, the IMRS over aggregate consumption is


                                        uc {cf [cf,1 (ω)]}   Pf,1 (ω) µf (ω)
                       Mf∗ (ω) ≡ β                         =                 ,            ω ∈ Ω.                        (73)
                                          uc [cf (cf,0 )]     Pf,0 λf π(ω)

We use the      ∗   notation for the foreign agent to emphasize that the agents' consumption

aggregators are dierent.

   Together. Eqs. (72) and (73) imply that


                     Mf∗ (ω)
                                                                  

Letting   X(ω) = e1 (ω)/e0        we can rewrite Eq. (74) as


                                               Mf∗ (ω)
                                                       = X(ω)Ξ(ω) .                                                     (75)

A Specic Model Under Complete Markets
We adopt the following assumptions: (1) There are two goods,                         1   and   2, with good 1 being
the numeraire, and being frictionlessly traded. (2)                 u(·) = ln(·),   (3)   cd (c1d , c2d ) = (c1d )θd (c2d )1−θd
andcf (c1f , c2f ) = (c1f )θf (c2f )1−θf . These assumptions imply that the CPIs in the two countries,
measured in units of good 1, are



                              Pd = ρd (Pd2 )1−θd ,          and       Pf = ρf (Pf2 )1−θf ,                              (76)


                                                   −θf
with   ρd = θd−θd (1 − θd )θd −1 ,    and   ρf = θf      (1 − θf )θf −1 .   The real exchange rate is



                                         e = (ρf /ρd )[(Pf2 )1−θf /(Pd2 )1−θd ] .                                       (77)



   We discuss two specic examples of our model, which assume, alternatively, that good                                      2
is frictionlessly traded or nontraded. We use the following notation, and henceforth drop the

notational dependence of time 1 variables on                  ω   unless it is needed. The global endowment
                           j   j     j
of good j in period t is Yt = ydt + yf t , j = 1, 2. The growth rates of the global endowments

of good j is G = Y1 /Y0 , j = 1, 2. We also dene gd = yd,1 /yd,0 and gf = yf,1 /yf,0 , j = 1, 2.
                                                                                    j     j    j
The domestic agent's share of the global endowment of good j at time t is st = ydt /Yt ,

                     s̄j1 =          sj1 (ω)π(ω), j = 1, 2,
                              P
j = 1, 2.   We let               ω                               denote the domestic agent's expected shares

of the global endowments in period 1.

Both Goods are Frictionlessly Traded.                       When both goods are frictionlessly traded, we

drop location subscripts from the price of good             2, and we write the market clearing conditions

To solve the model we let eliminate unknowns by solving for them in terms of the domestic

agent's expenditure at time 0, which we denote                 Fd = c1d,0 + P02 c2d,0 .   We denote the foreign

agent's expenditure at time 0 as         Ff = c1f,0 + P02 c2f,0 .   Eqs. (78) and (79) imply that    Fd = λ−1

Because the price of good 2 is the same in both economies, from Eq. (77) we can see that the

logarithm of the real exchange rate in each period is just             ln e = ln(ρf /ρd ) + (θd − θf ) ln(P 2 ).
Hence, from Eq. (108), the log change in the real exchange rate is



                               ln X(ω) = (θf − θd ) ln[G2 (ω)/G1 (ω)] .                                  (109)



   All that remains is to solve for        Fd . We can do this        by substituting Eqs. (93)(96) into

Using Eqs. (106), (107) and (108), we end up with


                                    θf (s10 + βs̄11 ) + (1 − θf )(s20 + βs̄21 ) 1

By substitution of this result into Eqs. (105) and (106), we get


                      θd [(1 − s10 ) + β(1 − s̄11 )] + (1 − θd )[(1 − s20 ) + β(1 − s̄21 )] 1

Given the form of the utility function, domestic aggregate consumption growth is



                 ln[cd,1 (ω)/cd,0 ] = θd ln[c1d,1 (ω)/c1d,0 ] + (1 − θd ) ln[c2d,1 (ω)/c2d,0 ].          (114)




                                                      34
Given Eqs. (93)(96) and (106)(108) we have



                                 c1d,1 (ω)/c1d,0 = G1 (ω) ,      ω ∈ Ω.                            (115)



                                 c2d,1 (ω)/c2d,0 = G2 (ω) ,      ω ∈ Ω.                            (116)


Hence, Eq. (114) can be rewritten as



                      ln[cd,1 (ω)/cd,0 ] = θd ln G1 (ω) + (1 − θd ) ln G2 (ω).                     (117)



Similarly, for the foreign agent, aggregate consumption growth is



                      ln[cf,1 (ω)/cf,0 ] = θf ln G1 (ω) + (1 − θf ) ln G2 (ω).                     (118)



One Good is Not Traded.          We now assume that it is not possible to trade good        2 between
the two economies. Thus, we replace the market clearing conditions for good                2,   (91) and

(92), with the following equations:



                                       c2d,0 = yd,0
                                                2

                            c2d,1 (ω) = yd,1

                                                                      2

We also assume, as in the main text, that        θd = θf = θ.     After noting that the price of good   2
now requires a location subscript, if we substitute Eqs. (93)(100) into the market clearing

Because agents have the same preferences, from Eq. (77) we can see that the logarithm of

the real exchange rate in each period is       ln e = (1 − θ) ln(Pf2 /Pd2 ).   Hence, from Eqs. (131)

and (132) the log change in the real exchange rate is



                            ln X(ω) = (1 − θ)[ln gd2 (ω) − ln gf2 (ω)] .                             (133)



   All that remains is to solve for   Fd .   In the lifetime budget constraint, Eq. (88), if we use

Eqs. (119) and (120), the terms involving the nontraded good cancel out from either side of

the equation. We can then use Eqs. (93), (95), and the notation           s1t = ydt
                                                                                 1
                                                                                    /Yt1 ,   to rewrite Eq.

                                                    ω

Using Eq. (130), we end up with
                                                 s10 + βs̄11 1

By substitution of this result into Eqs. (127), (128) and (129) we get

Given the form of the utility function, domestic aggregate consumption growth is



                 ln[cd,1 (ω)/cd,0 ] = θ ln[c1d,1 (ω)/c1d,0 ] + (1 − θ) ln[c2d,1 (ω)/c2d,0 ].            (139)



Given Eqs. (93), (95), (130), (119), and (120) we have



                                  c1d,1 (ω)/c1d,0 = G1 (ω) ,     ω ∈ Ω.                                 (140)



                                   c2d,1 (ω)/c2d,0 = gd2 (ω) ,   ω ∈ Ω.                                 (141)


Hence, Eq. (139) can be rewritten as



                        ln[cd,1 (ω)/cd,0 ] = θ ln G1 (ω) + (1 − θ) ln gd2 (ω).                          (142)



Similarly, for the foreign agent, aggregate consumption growth is



                        ln[cf,1 (ω)/cf,0 ] = θ ln G1 (ω) + (1 − θ) ln gf2 (ω).                          (143)



A Representative Agent Model.               We now consider a model with a single representative

agent whose preferences have the same functional form as in the previous examples, and

whose endowments correspond to the global endowments of the two goods. The agent also

has access to a complete set of state contingent claims. Letting            F   be the agent's expenditure

on consumption in period 0, and letting         θ   be the weight on good         1   in the utility function,

we can write the rst order conditions as



                                                 c10 = θF.                                              (144)



                                           c20 P02 = (1 − θ)F ,                                         (145)

                                                 π(ω)
                                  c11 (ω) = βθ          F,       ω ∈ Ω.                       (146)
                                                 PZ (ω)
                                                        π(ω)
                            c21 (ω)P12 (ω) = β(1 − θ)          F,      ω ∈ Ω.                 (147)
                                                        PZ (ω)
Given that in equilibrium the agent eats the global endowments of the two goods we have

c10 = Y01 , c20 = Y02 , c11 (ω) = Y11 (ω), and c21 (ω) = Y12 (ω), so it follows immediately from the
                                        1     2              1     2     2              1     2
rst order conditions that F = Y0 /θ , P0 = (1 − θ)Y0 /(θY0 ), P1 (ω) = (1 − θ)Y1 /(θY1 ), and

PZ (ω) = βπ(ω)/G1 (ω). The price of a state contingent claim against state ω is the same as
in the model with two agents. So is the rate of change of the price of good 2:


                                           P12 (ω)   G1 (ω)
                                                   =        .                                 (148)
                                             P02     G2 (ω)

The level of the price of good    2   at time 0 is also the same as in the two agent model if the

parameter weight of the single agent satises


                        1−θ   (1 − θf )(1 + β) + (θf − θd )(s10 + βs̄11 )
                            =                                             .                   (149)
                         θ       θf (1 + β) + (θd − θf )(s20 + βs̄21 )

The agent's IMRSs over the individual goods are


                              c10     β                            c20     β

                                   = 1            and        β    2
                                                                        = 2    ,              (150)

which are the same expressions we had for both agents in the two agent model.
