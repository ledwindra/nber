Targeted Price Controls on Supermarket Products

NBER Working Paper No. 24275
February 2018
JEL No. D22,E31
ABSTRACT
We study the impact of targeted price controls for supermarket products in Argentina from 2007
to 2015. Using web-scraping, we collected daily prices for controlled and non-controlled goods
and measured the differential effects on inflation, product availability, and price dispersion. We
first show that, although price controls are imposed on goods with significant CPI weight, they
have a temporary effect on aggregate inflation and no downward effect on other goods. Second,
contrary to common beliefs, we find that controlled goods are consistently available for sale.
Third, firms compensate for price controls by introducing new product varieties at higher prices.
This behavior, which increases price dispersion within narrow categories, is consistent with a
standard vertical differentiation model in the presence of price controls.

Introduction

In many countries, governments often consider some form of price controls when the prices of
popular goods rise above desired levels. On increasingly rare occasions, these price controls
are imposed across-the-board, affecting all goods and causing widespread shortages.1 But in
most cases, governments prefer to implement a more subtle form of “targeted” price controls
on a limited number of carefully-selected goods.2 Traditionally, these targeted controls
were limited to easy-to-regulate sectors, such as pharmaceuticals, utilities, or gas prices.3
More recently, the availability of online data, mobile phone apps, and electronic records
has dramatically increased the ability of governments to implement, monitor, and enforce
targeted price controls in all kinds of consumer goods. In particular, developing countries
such as Argentina, Ecuador, Israel, and Panama have had in the recent years some form of
targeted price controls for food and grocery products.4
Despite the increased interest in the use of targeted price controls, there is still little
empirical research investigating their economic effects. Are these controls binding? Do they
affect prices and inflation of related goods? Can they avoid shortages associated with more
generalized controls? What strategies do firms employ to deal with potentially lower profits
and better enforcement?
In this paper, we try to answer some of these questions by studying the rich and
volatile experience with price controls in Argentina from 2007 to 2015. These were mostly
1Venezuela is a particularly troubling recent case of across-the-board price controls. The armed forces
are in charge of a strict price controls and food supply program. The country had over 250% inflation in
2016 and is experiencing an unprecedented economic crisis with massive food shortages. See New York
Times: http://nyti.ms/220pqO1; Financial Times: http://on.ft.com/2ba0eCM; The Wall Street Journal:

freeze of prices that would be enforced by “people in the streets”. See El Nacional: http://bit.ly/2pGhxSo.
2Targeted controls are also referred to as “selective controls” in the literature (Rockoff (2004)).
3For example, developed countries such as Australia, Canada, and Switzerland currently have targeted
price control programs for pharmaceutical drugs. See http://www.pbs.gov.au/pbs/home; http://www.

for legislation to control drug prices. See, for example, New York Times: http://nyti.ms/1FuGLq8,

targeted controls, affecting a selected set of consumer products (e.g. whole milk, 1 liter,
brand X) while similar varieties remained free from any kind of restrictions. To help with
the visibility and enforcement programs, the government required retailers to display labels
identifying individual goods as being under a “government agreement”, including when the
goods were being sold online (as many Argentine supermarkets do). This meant we could
use the information found on supermarket’s websites to distinguish price-controlled goods
and track their prices on a daily basis. In particular, we used web-scraping technologies to
collect daily prices from October 2007 to May 2015 for more than 50 thousand products sold
by one of the largest supermarkets, including approximately 1.4 thousand that were under a
price control at some point in time.5
With this high-frequency panel of controlled and non-controlled goods, we examine
the before-and-after impacts of price controls from micro and macro perspectives. Our main
results can be summarized as follows:
First, we show that price controls tend to be imposed on goods that have significant
weights in the CPI basket and for varieties sold by leading brands. This result is consistent
with Cox (1980), who argues that focusing on products with high CPI weight and on concentrated industries would ensure the greatest impact on CPI inflation as well as the ability
of the government to enforce the controls.
Second, the impact of targeted price controls on aggregate inflation is temporary and
small. Controlled goods are sold at “government agreement” prices, which are on average
3.3% lower than before the control. This lower price is usually compensated by a similar
increase in prices as soon as the controls are relaxed.
Third, contrary to common beliefs, we find that controlled goods are seldom discontinued and that their general availability is similar to that of non-controlled goods. They
have a higher probability of going temporarily out of stock, but stockouts are short-lived and
goods are only occasionally discontinued. One likely explanation is that the government’s
5See Cavallo (2016) and Cavallo and Rigobon (2016) for details on the scraping methodology. Cavallo (2017)
compares online and offline prices for 56 large multichannel retailers in 10 countries and shows that prices tend
to be identical most of the time.

enforcement of both prices and stocks was aided by new technologies, including a mobile app
allowing consumers to scan product barcodes in the stores, check “government agreement”
prices, and send online complaints to an enforcement agency in cases of price discrepancies
or stockouts.
Fourth, given that price controls are binding in prices and availability, we study how
firms might offset lower profit margins. Consistent with the predictions of a standard vertical
differentiation model in the presence of price controls, we find evidence that firms expanded
their product line with new varieties at higher prices. We further show how this strategy
increased price dispersion within controlled categories, which suggests an additional welfare
cost from search frictions. In addition, once we construct price indices using URL average
prices (i.e. products listed on the same URL narrow sub-categories), we find higher inflation
for non-controlled goods than similar controlled good. This effect cannot be captured using
traditional matched-model price indices. In contrast to some reports in the Argentine media,
we find no evidence suggesting that firms reduced package sizes or that per-gram and
per-liter inflation was higher.
Our paper contributes to different strands of literature. A first strand is related to
an extensive literature on price controls from a macroeconomic perspective, most of which
focuses on the US price and wage controls program during Richard Nixon’s presidency in the
1970s.6 The Argentine experience is more closely related to Israel’s, where the government
has often controlled the price of subsets of basic food products, fuel, and public transportation
(Cukierman and Leiderman (1984)).7 We contribute to this literature by using micro data
and comparing inflation rates for both controlled and non-controlled goods within narrow
categories.
Our work is also related to a literature that studies price controls from a micro or
6Rockoff (2004) provides an excellent overview of the history of price controls in the United States, ranging
from the Revolutionary War to the Vietnam War. Galbraith (1952), Friedman (1966), and Solow (1966), provide
early formal treatments on the subject. Helpman (1988) shows that the macroeconomic effects of price controls
depend on the market structure. Other papers include U.S. Council of Economic Advisers (1973), Gordon
(1973), Gordon (1975), Gordon (1977), Schultze (1975), Darby (1976a), McGuire (1976), Oi (1976), Cox (1980),
and Blinder and Newton (1981).

industrial organization perspective. Fershtman and Fishman (1994) and Rauh (2001) study
the relationship between price controls and consumer search behavior. Kyle (2007) finds that
price controls in one market affect entry strategies and the introduction of new products in
other markets. Leffler (1982) provides a model where firms decrease quality until shortages
from binding maximum prices are eliminated. Besanko, Donnenfeld, and White (1987) and
Besanko, Donnenfeld, and White (1988) find that maximum price regulation can counteract
the quality distortion in a monopoly price setting, and that firms may deteriorate quality for
lower willingness-to-pay consumers. Raymon (1983) argues that binding price ceilings can
decrease quality and consumer welfare in competitive markets.8
Finally, our work also relates to the growing literature that uses online good-level prices
to conduct research in macro and micro economics. Scraped online prices are being applied
to many areas, including offline and online pricing (Brynjolfsson and Smith (2000)), consumer
search and online elasticities (Ellison and Ellison (2009)), synchronization and pass-through
(Gorodnichenko and Talavera (2014)), and retail pricing dynamics (Cavallo (2016)). See also
Ellison and Fisher Ellison (2005) and Edelman (2012) for interesting overviews on research
in online markets, and its relationship with offline markets. Our results suggest that while
the Internet may have increased the ability of governments to monitor and enforce price
controls, these targeted programs have limited effects on aggregate inflation and can cause
potentially welfare-reducing effects through higher price dispersion and average prices.
The remainder of the paper is as follows. Section 2 describes the price controls in
Argentina from 2007 to 2015. Section 3 describes the web-scraping technology and the micro
dataset. Section 4 discusses the impact of price controls on inflation and product availability.
Section 5 presents a simple model and evidence of firms’ behavior in the presence of controls.
Section 6 concludes.

Price controls in Argentina

Argentina has a long history of price controls. In 1939, Congress passed a law to prevent
stockouts during the Second World War. And although originally conceived as a temporary
mean to lower inflation, subsequent governments have continued to rely on various forms of
price controls.9
We study the recent 2007–2015 period, during which the government experimented
with various types of targeted price controls in supermarket products. These price controls
were meant to curb inflation, which rose from 10% in 2006 to over 35% in 2016 (according
to unofficial estimates).10 These controls focused on food and beverages, which constitute
nearly 40% of the CPI basket. Despite the fact that they did not appear to have much of an
impact on the inflation rate, these programs were popular with voters, which explains why
they persist today. According to recent consulting and media surveys, 60% of Argentines
supported price controls policies, and 25% of consumers bought price-controlled goods,
which accounted for up to 20% of retailers’ revenues in supermarkets.11
This period of price controls can be divided into four stages, as shown in Figure 1.
Stages 1, 3, and 4 are examples of targeted price controls, and Stage 2 was a temporary freeze
of all goods sold by large supermarkets. Table 1 shows descriptive statistics for each of these
Stages.

10In addition to price controls, Argentina’s main strategy to deal with inflation was to manipulate the official
inflation statistics. See Cavallo (2012) for more details.
11The new government elected in 2015 continued the “Precios Cuidados” program. Current details can

The first stage lasted six years, from 2007 to 2013. It was characterized by confidential
ad-hoc price agreements with major supermarkets, which had to freeze prices temporarily
for selected goods. There were no official press releases or announcements that disclosed the
specific products being controlled, but some retailers showed a “government agreement”
label next to the product. We use this label to identify controlled products through scraping technologies. Numerous news articles throughout the period reported that this policy
resulted in major shortages, but there is no evidence of long-lasting shortages in our data, as
we discuss later.12

The second stage started in February 2013, when unofficial inflation reached 25%.13
The government announced that it had reached a new agreement with the largest retailers
in Argentina to freeze prices of all products for 60 days, and later extended it for another 60
days until May 31st.14 The number of products available for sale fell significantly around this
time, as discussed in Section 4.2. Prices remained stable for a few weeks but soon started to
rise again.
A third stage started in June 2013, when the government lifted the general freeze on
all but 500 products. In this instance the government released to the public the names and
“government agreement” prices for those 500 products, which included food, beverages,
cleaning, and health and personal care items. It first targeted major retailers in Buenos Aires
and then expanded throughout the country. Because not all retailers sold the same brands
or categories, each supermarket had its own list of 500 products whose prices had to stay
constant for six months. This price agreement was formalized under the name “Mirar para
Cuidar” (Look to Protect). The government increased program enforcement as well as its
advertising in public media. A political organization with close ties to the President, “La
Campora”, developed a web and mobile phone app that allowed “militants” to help monitor
and enforce the price controls. Several store locations were temporarily closed or fined due
to shortages.15
In December 2013, amid significant changes in cabinet,16 the government announced a
new stage of price controls called “Precios Cuidados” (Protected Prices). Launched in January
2014, it drastically reduced the product list to 100 different goods (194 varieties in total)
that were by then common in all major retailers. In an attempt to facilitate the diffusion

14Bloomberg: http://bloom.bg/1xujXRj.
15See Clarin (http://clar.in/2rQkLlp) and the Wall Street Journal (http://on.wsj.com/13Raffy). Figure
9 in the Appendix shows how the government increased the intensity of the price controls starting in 2013,
relative to the first stage of targeted controls. The number of distinct retailer categories (URLs) that had
controlled goods on a monthly basis significantly increased. A similar pattern is obtained when using distinct
goods instead of categories, and when changing the time window. For example, in July 2013, the retailer had
at least one controlled-good in 50 distinct categories. As shown in Section 4.2, the ups and downs of price
controls intensity are not related to data-scraping problems.

Minister of Economy, and the Central Bank President. See La Nacion: http://bit.ly/2cP1Mnf.

of price lists, the new program started with fewer categories and varieties that steadily
increased over time. Protected Prices also required producers to inform the government of
new product introductions that resembled those under controls. This clause was added
amid criticism that, in previous controls, firms launched similar products or varieties to
circumvent maximum prices.17 We discuss evidence of that strategy in Section 5.2.
The government also increased the firms’ costs of violating the agreements and implemented tighter and more sophisticated monitoring strategies.18 The government developed
a website with all product lists and prices, and made the information accessible with a
mobile phone app that allowed consumers to scan product barcodes and report stockouts
or incorrect prices. Militant groups close to the government posted pictures of CEOs and
owners of supermarket chains in the streets and encouraged people to help monitor prices.
These strategies were extensively advertised in public media, including radio, television,
newspapers, and official press releases.19 20
As of the time of writing, Protected Prices remains active and updated on a quarterly
basis, with new products and new maximum prices.21 This is consistent with price controls
sometimes being very popular and politically convenient, e.g. during the 1970s in the Unites
States (Nixon (1978), Blinder (1979)) and in Sweden (Jonung (1990)).

17See La Nacion: http://bit.ly/1wSlVFS.
18The government controlled for stockouts, wrong labeling, incorrect prices, incorrect product weight.
The agreements also stipulated that retailers should not limit purchases of controlled goods per household.
Companies and supermarket chains could be subject to temporary store closures and large monetary fines.

Scraped online prices

We use online prices from thousands of products sold online each day from 2007 to 2015
by one of the largest retailers in Argentina in terms of market share.22 The data were
scraped off the internet by the Billion Prices Project (BPP), an academic initiative at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology that collects online prices from hundreds of retailers
around the world.23 See Cavallo (2016) for a detailed overview of scraped online prices.
The data and scripts to reproduce the results in this paper will be publicly available at
http://www.thebillionpricesproject.com.
The scraping software is designed to search the HyperText Markup Language (HTML)
public code of a retailer’s website and to automatically store the pricing data of all goods on
a daily basis. In the occasional days when the scraping fails (e.g., a webpage is temporarily
broken), then prices are assumed constant until they are back online. The retailer assigns a
unique ID to each product sold online.
We identified price-controlled goods in two ways. First, from 2007 to 2015, the scraping
algorithm read a special HTML (ID-specific) tag next to each controlled good sold online.
This method accounts for about 75% of the controlled goods in our database. Second, after
the government started publishing lists of controlled goods in 2013, we manually identified
each these goods in our database.

3.1

Data description

Table 2 provides summary statistics of the data coverage. We have daily prices for more
than 50,000 distinct products from 2007 to 2015, and a yearly average of about 14,000 distinct
goods. The supermarket scraped data covers categories such as food, beverages, electronics,
household appliances, kitchen utensils, and health and personal care items, which collectively account for about 45% of the CPI weights.

22The same retailer is also used in Cavallo (2012) and Cavallo (2016).

We label products as controlled if they had a price control at least one day during
the scraping period. This results in 1,460 controlled goods, which is about 3% of the total
products in the database. Although a relatively small set, these goods have a significantly
higher weight in the CPI basket, as seen in Table 2.24
24In Appendix A.1 we expand on some of the key determinants of price controls, and find that for a unit
increase in the CPI weight (i.e. 1 percentage point) the odds of a control increase by 24%. Price controls are less
likely in less concentrated or homogeneous markets, as approximated with the number of brands, products,

11

On average, goods were controlled for six months, with a median of two and a half
months. About 25% of the controlled goods had price controls lasting more than 7 months.
If a product price was controlled more than once, there were usually no gaps in between.
Controlled goods were under price controls about 22% of the time. And a stable subset of
items consistently remained under price controls throughout the scraping period.25 Price
controls were generally imposed at the existing price level, but in about a third of the cases,
the new price was set lower. On average, the price change was -3.3%.

Aggregate impact of price controls

In this section we study the impact on inflation and product availability.

4.1

Aggregate inflation

We first construct a price index using a weighted arithmetic average of category indices. Each
category index is a Jevons geometric average of all products sold online. If an item is out of
stock we assume constant prices. And if an item is discontinued, then it no longer impacts
the index. Products that are out-of-stock are momentarily unavailable for online purchase,
while discontinued products were no longer offered online until the end of our scraping
period. Price changes are weighed using Argentina’s National Statistics Office (INDEC)
official weights by CPI category. See Cavallo (2012) and Aparicio and Bertolotto (2016) for
evidence that these type of online price indices can closely track and forecast official CPIs.
Figure 2 shows the price indices and the annual and monthly inflation rates based on
a 30-day moving average. We report results on three samples: all goods, controlled goods,
and non-controlled goods.

and varieties within the URL-category (i.e. narrow sub-categories). These findings are consistent with the
predictions in Cox (1980), who describes the policymakers’ problem as maximizing the impact on the price
index while reducing enforcement or deadweight costs.

The price index shows that the impact of price controls on aggregate inflation was small
and temporary. From 2007 to 2015, all price indices had recorded about 400% accumulated
inflation. There are periods when the inflation rate of controlled goods appears significantly
different than that of non-controlled varieties, as shown in the volatility of the monthly
inflation rate in panel (c). These periods are associated with weak or strong periods of price
agreements, but the difference was never large enough to have a significant impact on the
aggregate inflation rate for all items, as shown in panel (b). However, because we do not
have weights for individual goods within subcategories, it is possible that the government
chose specific varieties based on their perception as “leading brands”. But regardless of the
magnitude, the impact was temporary. Periods of low inflation in controlled goods were
quickly followed by higher inflation for those same goods. For example, controlled goods
had lower inflation until 2009 then much higher inflation in 2010 and 2011.

4.1.1

Effect on non-controlled goods

To determine if firms increased the price of related goods after price controls were imposed,
we split the sample of non-controlled goods into two parts: “related” and “unrelated”.
Related non-controlled goods are sold in subcategories that have goods under price controls
at the same time. One example of such subcategory could be ‘cereals’. Unrelated noncontrolled goods are sold in subcategories that had no price controls at all.
The related sample is constructed as follows. Each time an item is controlled for the
first time, we randomly select another product from the same subcategory such that ( i ) is in
stock that day, ( ii ) that is not controlled during the scraping period, and ( iii ) that has not
already been selected as related to another good (i.e. we draw without replacement). The
unrelated sample is constructed in a similar way but from non-controlled categories. The
controlled, related, and unrelated samples comprise 1,460, 1,321, and 1,400 distinct items,
respectively.
For each good, we keep prices for 90 days before and after it received the first price

14

control.26 This method produces a balanced panel for each sample (except for some censored
observations in some price spells for discontinued goods). We then compute the 30-day
rolling inflation at the good-level and average it across goods each day. This generates an
approximation of the average monthly inflation, shown in Figure 3 for a 90-day window
around the day the control is first introduced.

Figure 3: 90-day window before and after the first price control

This figure highlights three findings. First, consistent with the previous discussion,
there were temporary effects on controlled-goods prices. The monthly inflation rate falls to
-5% immediately after the control is imposed, and 30 days later the monthly inflation is close
to 0% (indicating that prices remain fixed). However after two months, the inflation rate
rises to +5%, compensating for previous declines.
Second, non-controlled goods in related categories do not have higher inflation rates
after the control. Their behavior is similar to that of non-controlled goods in unrelated categories, suggesting that firms were not compensating for the controls by increasing prices
of related goods. In some cases, the government explicitly monitored the behavior of related goods, which likely limited firms’ ability to compensate through the prices of existing
26We focus on the first event to avoid picking up behaviors that are connected to previous controls, but the
results are similar if we make no distinctions for repeated controls.

15

varieties.
Third, a surprising result is that related goods have higher inflation before the controls
are imposed. Their prices start to rise faster 60 days before the control, and the inflation
difference peaks 15 days before the control is imposed. Goods that will later be under a
price control, and those in unrelated categories, do not experience similar price increases.
One possible explanation is that firms increased prices of some varieties to make potential
candidates for a price control appear relatively cheap already. Overpricing varieties that
were less likely to be under a price control could be a strategy to negotiate a higher price
ceiling on the cheap variety.27
In summary, price controls on specific goods did not seem to have a downward effect
on the inflation rate of related goods in the same categories. This applies to goods that were
being sold at the time of the price control. In Section 5.2 we explore whether targeted price
controls affected the price of new varieties introduced after a price control takes place.

4.2

Product availability

Price controls are typically expected to produce shortages. But can better monitoring tools
prevent them? In order to answer this we compute a measure of “product availability”,
defined as the number of items available for sale online on a given day.28 Panel (a) in
Figure 4 shows that the retailer sold over 13,000 products per day, of which about 700 were
controlled-goods. The flat line between late 2009 and early 2010 is due to partial scraping
failures.

27See also Blinder (1979) on related overpricing strategies during price controls in the Unites States.
28Cavallo (2016) shows that in Argentina, close to 100% of the goods found offline are also available online
and have similar prices.

Figure 4: Product Availability

The availability of controlled goods was surprisingly stable over time, at around 700
items per day. Although newspapers claimed that price controls produced major stockouts,
we found no such evidence in our data. We also simulated online purchases on several
occasions and found no shipping delays nor limits on the number of units that could be
purchased.29
The only major drop in availability occurred when the government imposed a total
price freeze (shaded region). About 100 goods were discontinued during that period, and
another 200 disappeared when controls ended. Once the programs became targeted again,
in Stage 3, the availability of controlled goods stabilized, though at a much lower level.30

4.3

Temporary stockouts

Even if the government can prevent retailers from discontinuing goods, we expect controlled
goods to experience more frequent stockouts. In this section, we use survival analysis to
study the risk of stockouts across samples.
29A potential explanation is that price ceilings were being set above the intersection of demand and marginal
cost curves in non-competitive industries (Darby (1976b), Helpman (1988)), so profits margins could be smaller
but still positive.
30These discontinuities explain why availability did not recover. In Figure 13 in the Appendix we plot
product introductions and discontinuities over time, and show that these were more pervasive when the
government increased the intensity of price controls.

17

The onset of risk, or t0 , is defined as the day each good received its first price control
during the scraping period from 2007 to 2015. The end date, or failure event, is the day of the
first stockout after the control is imposed. If the scraping package fails, no price observations
are recorded for that date. We control for these cases and for right-censored observations
(i.e., controlled goods that did not go out of stock by the end of the scraping period).
Panel (a) in Figure 5 shows a histogram of the number of days until the first stockout,
that is for each good we compute the number of days between t0 and the failure event. We
find that controlled goods do experience a relatively faster stockout: one and a half months
after the first price control more than 50% of the goods have gone out of stock, compared
to 40% in the related non-controlled varieties. Vertical lines depict average days for each
sample.

We also estimate the survival function S ( t ) , defined as the survival probability (or

Where n j is the number of goods at time t j and d j is the number of stock-out events at time

Panel (b) in Figure 5 shows the estimated survival function for both controlled and
related goods.31 Although survival functions exhibit similar shapes, the probability of being
in stock is about 15% higher for (related) non-controlled goods a month after controls were
imposed.

How do firms respond to price controls?

The previous sections show that targeted controls in Argentina, while do not significantly
affect the aggregate inflation rate, they do force some firms to sell goods at lower prices
and keep them in stock most of the time. So how do firms cope with price controls?32
Although we find no evidence that firms increased prices of existing goods, we find that
firms introduced new varieties at higher prices, which in turn increased price dispersion
within controlled categories. We first motivate the effect of targeted price controls on firms’
pricing behavior with a simple vertical differentiation model, and then discuss the empirical
evidence.

31Results remain robust to alternative functions, such as the non-parametric Nelson–Aalen cumulative
hazard function (Kaplan and Meier (1958)).
32Some firms actually benefited from the price agreements by gaining market share. In principle, these price
agreements provided advertising and facilitated product distribution to major retailers throughout the country.
For example, an Argentine firm producer of vinegar, mayonnaise, and other dressings, reported that 27% of its
2014 sales could be attributed to the Protected Prices program, and that these products exhibited a 28% increase
in gross sales. Participating in the price agreements allowed the firm to access new retailers and supermarket
chains in segments that were previously restricted to major brands. See Telam: http://bit.ly/1GTMC4q,

5.1

A simple model of price controls

We assume consumers have unit demands per unit of time and preferences separable in
quality and price (i.e. no income effects).33 The indirect utility from consuming good i is
given by
U ( θ, s )  θs i − p i

(1)

And zero if no good is purchased. Where s and θ stand for quality level and willingness-topay for quality. Consumers have heterogenous tastes over quality. We assume θ is uniformly
distributed over the interval [θ, θ̄] and a density of 1. For simplicity we report results for
θ  0 and θ̄  1.
Although the monopolist cannot observe θ and perfectly discriminate, she can supply
combinations of quality and price given the distribution of tastes and the market size.34 We
assume the monopolist supplies one good, and faces a fixed cost f i per good and variable
quadratic costs of quality improvement C ( s ) , with C0 ( s ) > 0 and C00 ( s ) > 0. We further
assume the standard form C ( s )  αs 2 , and that costs are independent of the quantity
supplied.
The firm’s problem can be described as a two-stage game: the monopolist chooses
quality in the first stage and prices in the second. This sequence of decisions makes sense
in our micro context. Once the retailer introduces good i, a salient quality attribute s
is presumably fixed throughout the life of a good, whereas the price can more easily be
updated. The Appendix discussed the case when quality is flexible.
In the absence of price controls, the optimal monopolist quality and price are s m 
and p m 

Relative to a social planner who maximizes aggregate surplus, the monopolist

supplies the same quality but serves half the market. Specifically, the social planner chooses
33Vertical differentiation models have become a standard framework in industrial organization since Mussa
and Rosen (1978), Gabszewicz and Thisse (1979), Shaked and Sutton (1982), and Tirole (1988). See also Moorthy
(1988), Motta (1993), and Cheng and Peng (2014).
34Note that θ can be reinterpreted as the inverse of the marginal rate of substitution between income
and quality (Tirole (1988)). Therefore the above preferences can reflect consumers with identical tastes but
heterogenous income (a higher θ denotes a lower marginal utility of income).
35See proof in Appendix A.5.1.

and thus θ̂ sp  1/3, while θ̂ m  2/3.

Now imagine that, with the intention of reducing prices to increase the pool of consumers for an essential good, the government imposes a binding price ceiling p̄  τp m ,
with 0 < τ < 1.

We assume that firms are subject to capacity constraints.

In other

words, if p̄ is set too low, the firm cannot possibly serve the entire demand. We thus let
D ( s m , p̄ ) < D̃  D ( s m , p m ) γ, with γ > 1, be an upper bound to what the firm can serve. To
offset its impact, a firm could readjust quality or introduce a new good. These results are
explained in the following Remarks.
Remark 1. If price p̄ < p m is fixed but quality s is flexible, the monopolist downgrades quality
regardless of the cost of quality improvement α.
Proof. See Appendix A.5.2.



Remark 2. The monopolist benefits from introducing a new, higher price-quality variety. A new
good also deters a rival firm from entering the market to steal excess demand.
Proof. See Appendix A.5.3.



The monopolist can reduce the price-ceiling burden by introducing a new and more
expensive variety. This strategy results in higher profits relative to a wait-and-see attitude
(continue to sell one good), and it prevents a rival firm from entering and exploiting a
distorted product line. Let p̄ L , s L , and θL stand for the incumbent’s price, quality, and
marginal consumer for the (original) low-quality good. Then an entrant could introduce a
better-quality good, H, and set p H and s H such that θH  θL , and steal the entire market.
Where θH 

and θL 

pL
sL .

Recall that p H > p L  p̄ is possible, because price ceilings affect

a subset of goods.36

36The monopolist would prefer to discontinue the controlled good and introduce a similar variety. Alternatively, she could introduce a second good and, once controls are removed, discontinue the controlled good.
We abstract from dynamic considerations but note that a richer model might consider strategic responses that
depend on the expected duration of price controls and the probability of getting caught cheating. The Appendix
discusses extensions to this model.

21

Depending on the price ceiling, capacity constraint, and cost asymmetries between
firms, the monopolist would in general be in a better position to crowd the product line,
relative to an entrant that needs to position a new product. Moreover, that a monopolist may
attenuate the impact of price controls through new products can be related to an extensive
literature on brand proliferation and entry deterrence.37

Figure 6 illustrates the main intuitions from the model. Initially, the firm sells a
single good at price p m , and demand is 1 − θ m . A price ceiling p̄ < p m lowers the marginal
consumer for the (original) low-priced s L good from θ m to θp̄ . A sufficiently low price ceiling
binds the capacity constraint and generates excess demand (1 − θ̃ ) for the controlled good.
To deter entry and benefit from the high willingness-to-pay consumers, the monopolist is
incentivized to segment the market with a new and more expensive good s H . This increases
price dispersion within controlled categories. Introducing a new good is Subgame Perfect
Nash Equilibrium (SPNE): it is only after the price control that the firm is better off supplying
a second good. Moreover, that price controls can increase market share is consistent with
anecdotical evidence reported in the news.38
37See Caves and Porter (1977), Schmalensee (1982), and Urban, Carter, Gaskin, and Mucha (1986) on the
advantages of pioneering brands, and Lutz (1997) on the monopolist’s ability to deter (or accommodate) entry
under vertical differentiation. See Hay (1976), Prescott and Visscher (1977), Schmalensee (1978), Bonanno
(1987), Shaked and Sutton (1990), Gilbert and Matutes (1993) on brand proliferation.
38See footnote 32 for an example describing how price controls provide free advertising and facilitate access
to new markets. We assume consumers are perfectly informed about the attributes of the good; however, one
might also think of advertising as a new margin to attract consumers under product differentiation (Grossman
and Shapiro (1984)). See the Appendix for additional discussions.

22

5.2

Evidence from firms’ behavior

For targeted price controls, an effective strategy might be to introduce new varieties at
higher prices.39 For example, in January 2014, the government controlled the popular kids’
dessert Chocolate Vanilla Shimy and Dulce de Leche Vanilla Shimy. Several days after the first
control, the firm introduced the new variety Vanilla Chocolate Shimy at a 50% higher price. In
June 2013, Royal’s Dulce de Leche, 65 grams cake powder was controlled; the same week Royal
introduced Light Dulce de Leche, 40 grams at a -24% lower price (but bulk-adjusted represented
a 23% increase). Examples like these are numerous and easy to find.
Traditional matched-model price indices, such as those used in Section 4.1, are unable
to capture the impact of new varieties. The reason is that they are based on the price changes
of goods that are present in two time periods. The prices at introduction of new product
varieties are therefore ignored and do not affect the price index.
A simple way of detecting the introduction of higher priced varieties is by constructing
average-price indices, which are based on average prices for all varieties sold each day in a
narrowly defined category.40 To measure the impact of new and exiting varieties, we first
compute average-price indices for both controlled and non-controlled goods in the same
subcategories, and then build aggregate price indices using official CPI category weights.
Our data are well suited for this analysis, because the web-scraping package adds goods to
our sample on the first day that they appear on the store.
As Figure 7 panel (a) shows, the inflation rate for non-controlled goods is higher once
we account for the price levels of new varieties at the time of introduction. The averageprice index has more inflation than the corresponding matched-model (chained) index that
uses only prices changes, and significantly more inflation than the average-price index for
controlled goods. We also find that the average price index for controlled goods is lower
than its corresponding chained index (shown in Figure 2), widening the gap in inflation with
39See Bourne (1919), Darby (1976a), Jonung (1990), Rockoff (2004) for other references in the literature.
40Parsing out the product description string into grams and liters amounts per item, we find no evidence
that firms systematically reduced package sizes to cope with price controls. However, if they did, the results
would be stronger (a smaller size would increase the per-unit price of the new product).

Notes: In Panel (a), “Controlled” and “Non-Controlled” are average price indices as described in the text;
“Non-Controlled (Chained)” is a standard chained or matched-model price index.

We can also detect higher-priced varieties also by looking at price dispersion before
and after controls are introduced. This can be seen in Figure 7 panel (b), which plots the
price dispersion within subcategories for all goods and the subset of “continuing” goods.41
In both cases, price dispersion rises a few days before the price control is introduced, but in
the sample that includes new varieties (all goods), the dispersion continues to rise after the
control is in place.

Conclusions

During the past ten years, Argentina has experienced various forms of targeted price controls
in which the government set price ceilings for specific supermarket goods. We use web41We compute price dispersion as the coefficient of variation, i.e. standard deviation of prices over average
prices, per week and URL. We then averaged these URL-level time series for each week, 6 months before and
after the first control. Panel (b) in Figure 7 shows that price dispersion increases by around 12% during the
first weeks post-control. Furthermore, the dispersion is primarily driven by new goods following price ceilings
and does not revert to its initial levels. See Appendix A.2 for further discussion on price dispersion, including
similar results using monthly-URL regressions. See also Table 7 and Figures 13 and 14 in the Appendix for
evidence on the introduction of non-controlled varieties in controlled URLs. We find that after price controls
were introduced, the number of non-controlled varieties increased over 15%.

24

scraping technologies to collect online prices from one of the largest retailers in the country
and construct a detailed micro panel dataset with more than 50,000 goods, which we use to
evaluate the impact of price controls.
We show that, although price controls targeted goods with high CPI weight, they
had minor and temporary effects on inflation. Price controls were binding, both in price
and availability, but we find evidence that firms introduced new varieties at higher prices
to compensate for reduced profit margins. This increased price dispersion within narrow
categories of controlled goods.
Our results suggest that new technologies, such as the Internet and mobile phones,
may allow governments to better enforce targeted price controls programs. Still, this does
not make price controls an effective policy to reduce aggregate inflation, because the effects
are short-lived and do not spill over to non-controlled goods. Furthermore, firms adjust to
targeted price controls by using strategies that may obfuscate consumer options and increase
price dispersion.
Future research should weigh the temporary income effects from price ceilings against
the welfare losses associated with search frictions from price transparency and price dispersion, administrative enforcement costs, and investments in the retail industry.

Appendix
Determinants of price controls

We expand on some of the key determinants of price controls. In relation to the price-wage
control in the United States, Cox (1980) argues that policymakers balance between two forces:
control industries with higher weight on the price index, while minimizing enforcement or
inefficiency costs. One might expect that the degree of price controls is increasing in: the
CPI weight of a given good, elastic demand or inelastic supply, industry concentration, or
more homogenous goods. See also Galbraith (1952). The scraping technology applied to the
selective program in Argentina offers an attractive setting to test for these determinants.
We formalize the analysis as follows. For each good sold online by the retailer, we
manually matched each URL-based category with the official CPI categories from Argentina’s
NSO. This allows to obtain good-level weights. Industry concentration is approximated by
the number of distinct available brands (or products) per URL, and homogenous goods
are approximated by the average number of varieties per brand-URL. A good’s brand is
recognized by parsing out the scraped product description and keeping a string of letters
with special font.42 We then run simple Logit binary regressions of the controlled dummy
on a series of covariates.43
Table 3 shows the results. Controlled is a dummy variable equal to 1 if the good
had a price control; CPI Weight is a good’s CPI weight, which in our sample ranges from
0.03% to 6%; Products, Brands, and V arieties are the number of distinct goods, brands,
and varieties (in tens) per subcategory.
Coefficients are expressed in terms of the odds ratio. Consider for instance the specifi-

42Once we obtain the number of brands (products), varieties, and good-level weights, we collapse the panel
data into a cross-section by taking the average over time at the good level. One observation per ID is appropriate
in our case since these variables tend to be stable over time. Controlled-goods use only information through the
first price control to take into account that the number of varieties or products are affected once firms receive
price controls. See Section 5.2.
43Results remain very similar under probit or OLS regressions, as well as using pooled category-level data.
Table 4 shows the results for the OLS specification.

cation in column (3). For a unit increase in the CPI weight (i.e. 1 percentage point), the odds
of a control increase by 24%. The sign is consistent with the statistics in Section 3 showing
that controlled-goods have a higher CPI weight relative to the other goods. The estimates
also suggest that if the number of products in the URL increase by 10, i.e. a more competitive
industry, the odds of a control decrease by over 7%. Price controls are also less likely the
more varieties of the good.

A.2

Price Dispersion

It has become part of folk wisdom that price controls can indirectly benefit the inflationary
process through inflation expectations.44 To the extent that price controls are intensely
advertised and discussed in the media and in a government’s agenda, and affect salient and
essential goods, households could potentially adjust their inflation expectations based on
individual supermarket purchases (Malmendier and Nagel (2016)).45
However, inflation expectations have remained relatively flat even around key price
controls announcements (see Figure 12 in the Appendix). The fact that price controls reduce
inflation momentarily but its effect weakens soon afterwards might help explain why inflation
expectations remain stable over time. Moreover, as discussed in Section 4.1, there is no
44See Galbraith (1952), Friedman (1974), Blinder and Newton (1981), Rockoff (2004).
45In fact, controlled goods must exhibit a special price tag in the supermarket aisles. These stickers increase
the advertising channel, draw further attention to controlled-goods, and potentially enhance price differences.
See Bordalo, Gennaioli, and Shleifer (2013).

33

noticeable effect on non-controlled goods. Perhaps more importantly, price controls increase
price dispersion within controlled-categories. A visual average difference-in-differences
effect of the initial price control on price dispersion is depicted in Panel (b) in Figure 7.
We identify the first time a price control was applied to any product within each
category-URL. Price dispersion or the coefficient of variation, defined as the standard deviation of prices over average prices, is computed per week and URL. We then averaged out these
URL-level time series for each week 6 months before and after the first control, and found
that price dispersion increases by around 12% during the first weeks post-control. When
we distinguish between all goods and those introduced before the event, we find that the
divergence is mostly driven by newly introduced goods; price dispersion within pre-existing
goods comes down a few weeks later. Furthermore, we find that dispersion increases among
the expensive varieties, but not among cheaper ones: the 50-10 percentile ratio is relatively
stable, while the 90-10 or 90-50 increases after time 0. This suggests, as we document in
Section 5.2, that firms respond to price ceilings through new higher-priced non-controlled
goods.
We formalize these findings in a regression framework that quantifies the effect on
price dispersion using price controls indicators and a series of covariates. Observations are
aggregated to the monthly-URL level (similar estimates are obtained with weekly observations). The estimates in Table 5 can be interpreted as price ceilings raising price dispersion
between 8-18%. Although large, these magnitudes are comparable to Drenik and Perez
(2016), who study the effect of manipulating inflation information in Argentina, and find
that uncertainty about official inflation increased price dispersion in an E-Trade platform.
These results alone are relevant to an extensive literature on the welfare costs from
price dispersion, e.g. macro models of sticky prices and staggered price changes, and
industrial organization models on consumer search.46 In this case, we note that higher
46See for example Benabou (1992), Woodford (2003), Burstein and Hellwig (2008)), Nakamura and Steinsson
(2013), Alvarez, Gonzalez-Rozada, Neumeyer, and Beraja (2016), and many references mentioned therein. See
also Ater and Rigbi (2017) for evidence on the positive relationship between price dispersion and price levels
in Israel.

34

price dispersion within existing goods is unambiguously welfare decreasing. And this is
exacerbated if competing retailers respond in a similar way. However, price dispersion on
newly introduced goods need not be welfare decreasing if these products are, for example, of
higher quality and consumers have preferences with “love for variety”. Finally, a higher price
dispersion also suggests the unsuccessful efforts to reduce aggregate inflation. Even though
price controls target leading brands, are intensively advertised, and hence potentially salient
to a consumer’s shopping experience (Bordalo, Gennaioli, and Shleifer (2013), Malmendier
and Nagel (2016)), low-price references can be confounded in a highly inflationary and price
dispersed retail industry.

Single-Product Monopolist

In the single product case with an uncovered market, demand is given by θ̄ − θ̂, where θ̂
stands for the marginal consumer for which θs − p ≥ 0. In stage two, price is set to maximize
profits given quality, i.e. p ∗ ( s ) 

where x is positive but finite. Then it can be shown that the profit

difference is negative when x > 1, and does not depend on the cost α. Alternatively, one can
think of the profit function π ( τ, α, s ) in terms of monotone comparative statics. π ( τ, α, s )
is a twice continuously differentiable function in ( τ, s ) , and T and S can be thought of as
convex. Then it can be shown that π ( τ, α, s ) has increasing differences in ( τ, s ) . In other
words, the extra benefit of increasing s (quality) is higher when τ is higher.
Under the new price p̄, the firm would like to set a lower quality s̃ < s m regardless
of cost α. For instance, when τ  0.9, the new quality is about 7% lower. Although we
cannot empirically measure quality, we note that quality downgrades substituting for price
47We assume costs take the standard form C ( s )  αs 2 , and that are independent of the quantity supplied.
Convex quality costs are common in the literature (see Mussa and Rosen (1978), Besanko, Donnenfeld, and
White (1987), Champsaur and Rochet (1989)).

increases were common in past experiences. For instance, see Bourne (1919) on France in the
years following the French Revolution, Darby (1976a) on the 1970s U.S. wage-price controls,
Rockoff (2004) on the US during the World World II, or Moon and Stotsky (1993) on rent
control programs in the US. However downgrading quality, particularly in essential goods,
can be costly in terms of reputation and potential fines.

A.5.3

Proof of Remark 2

When the firm waits-and-sees, i.e. sit tight and wait until the price control is over, she obtains
a profit equal to π  D ( p̄, τ, γ )

2/3) γ to account for possible capacity constraints. However, wait-and-see is not SPNE,
because a potential entry has now extra incentives to serve the higher willingness-to-pay
for quality consumers. In particular, the entrant would like to set s H and p H such that
θH 

∆p

 θL , while also satisfying (1) s H > s L , (2) p H > p L  p̄, (3) θH < 1, and therefore

steal the entire market. The extent to which an entrant can enter depends on α, τ, and the
fixed cost differential across firms.
However, if τ or f2 are low enough, the monopolist is better off introducing a new
higher price-quality good.48 This allows to capture the excess demand via market segmentation, i.e. discriminate between different θ-tastes for quality consumers. Let s L and
p L  p̄ denote the original’s single-product optimal quality and afterwards controlled price,
respectively. And then let s H and p H be the second product’s optimal quality and price.
The demand for good L and H are given by the marginal consumers θL and θH , namely

48Our model differs from previous work which focus on across-the-board price controls, e.g. Raymon
(1983), Besanko, Donnenfeld, and White (1987), Besanko, Donnenfeld, and White (1988). For instance in
Besanko, Donnenfeld, and White (1987) the monopolist offers a continuous quality array, and p ( θ ) < p̄, ∀θ.
The price controls that we study are only binding for a subset of goods.
49For simplicity it is assumed that the firm does not leave “holes” in the demand line when introducing
a new good, i.e. no excess demand between θL and θH . Where θ̃ stands for the maximum willing-to-pay
consumer that can be supplied under binding capacity constraints. The same condition is used in A.5.4 for the
multi-product monopolist.

θH < θ̃ ( γ ) < θ̄. Where we set θ  0 and θ̄  1. The firm’s response is SPNE in the sense
that introduces a new good that, in the absence of price controls, decided not to introduce.

A.5.4

Multi-product monopolist

We briefly mention the case of a multi-product monopolist. Consider a two-good monopolist
that supplies a low quality good s L at price p L , and a high quality good s H good at price
p H . In the absence of price controls, it can be shown that the optimal prices and qualities
are p L 

sL 

and p H 

sH 

Now consider a price ceiling p̄ L < p L on the

low-priced good. Intuitively, the response depends on the trade-off between extra profits
from introducing a third good, the magnitudes of fixed costs and quality costs, the lost excess
demand from capacity constraints, and harshness of the price ceiling. The firm may want to
re-adjust s H and p H , possibly a price decrease and quality downgrade, wait-and-see if she is
compelled to serve the excess demand, or finally introduce a third variety resulting in higher
average non-controlled prices.
Formally, that the monopolist may want to decrease p H leaving s H constant follows
from the first-order condition for p H in the two-goods’ problem: p H  p̄ L +

The first-order condition for s H does not depend on p L . If changing prices are subject to no
product holes (serve excess demand), depending on the harshness of p̄ L , costs α and f i , and
the degree of capacity constraints, the firm could either wait-and-see, i.e. ration supply for
controlled-good s L with no price changes, or introduce a third variety, possibly resulting in
higher average quality at the expense of higher non-controlled price dispersion and higher
average prices.
The constrained three-goods problem can be stated as follows:
maxs M ,s H (

(3) p̄ L < p M < p H , (4) s L < s M < s H , and

(5) θ < θL < θM < θ̃ ( γ ) < θH < θ̄. We set θ  0 and θ̄  1.

The firm’s problem with targeted price ceilings could be extended in several ways.
A multi-firm problem would be better addressed using both horizontal and vertical differentiation, i.e. consumers have heterogeneous preferences over brands and quality, respectively. From stylized demands for differentiated products, where q L  a L − b L p L + cp H and
q H  a H − b H p H + cp L , one notes that the effects of price controls are not straightforward.
The effects depend on price or quantity competition, strategic complements or substitutes,
and the capacity constraints. Other domains to enhance the analysis are, for example, the
effects of advertising, costly consumer search, consumer switching costs, anticipated and
unanticipated price ceilings, and overshooting from costly price changes or stickiness. Aggressive price ceilings, even below marginal costs, can be related to an interesting literature
on loss-leaders (Lal and Matutes (1994)).
