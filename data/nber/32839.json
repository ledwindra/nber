    "abstract": "\n\nThe distribution of parental leave uptake and childcare activities continues to conform to traditional gender roles. In 2002, with the goal of increasing gender equality, Sweden added a second \u201cdaddy month,\u201d i.e., an additional month of pay-related parental leave reserved exclusively for each parent. This policy increased men\u2019s parental leave uptake and decreased women\u2019s, thereby increasing men\u2019s share. To understand how various factors contributed to these outcomes, we develop and estimate a quantitative model of the household in which preferences towards parental leave respond to peer behavior. We distinguish households by the education of the parents and ask the model to match key features of the parental leave distribution before and after the reform by gender and household type (the parents\u2019 education). We find that changed incentives and, especially, changed social norms played an important role in generating these outcomes whereas changed wage parameters, including the future wage penalty associated with different lengths of parental leave uptake, were minor contributors. We then use our model to evaluate three counterfactual policies designed to increase men\u2019s share of parental leave and conclude that giving each parent a non-transferable endowment of parental leave or only paying for the length of time equally taken by each parent would both dramatically increase men\u2019s share whereas decreasing childcare costs has almost no effect.\n\n",
