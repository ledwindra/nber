    "abstract": "\n\nWe model a financial market in which investor beliefs are shaped by representativeness.  Investors overreact to a series of good news, because such a series is representative of a good state.  A few bad news do not change investor minds because the good state is still representative, but enough bad news leads to a radical change in beliefs and a financial crisis.  The model generates debt over-issuance, \u201cthis time is different\u201d beliefs, neglect of tail risks, under- and over-reaction to information, boom-bust cycles, and excess volatility of prices in a unified psychological model of expectations.\n\n",
