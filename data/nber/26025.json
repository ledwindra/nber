    "abstract": "\n\nThe paper provides the first assessment of: (i) America\u2019s progress in lifting the lower bound\u2014the floor\u2014of the distribution of real income; (ii) whether the country\u2019s largest antipoverty program, SNAP (\u201cfood stamps\u201d), helped do so. An operational method of estimating the floor is implemented on micro survey data spanning 30 years, with various robustness and significance tests. SNAP partially compensated the poorest, and helped stabilize the floor. Nonetheless, the floor has been sinking over the last 30 years. The efficiency of SNAP in lifting the floor has declined over time. Full coverage of the poorest would lift the floor appreciable.\n\n",
