We explore trends in the concentration of the DNS space since at least 2011. In addition, we examine changes in domains\u2019 tendency to \u201cdiversify\u201d their pool of nameservers \u2013 how frequently domains employ DNS management services from multiple providers rather than just one provider \u2013 a comparatively costless and therefore puzzlingly rare decision that could supply redundancy and resilience in the event of an attack or service outage affecting one provider.\n\n",
