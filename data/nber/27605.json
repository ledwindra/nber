    "abstract": "\n\nWe provide evidence that the arrival of technical human capital improves regional entrepreneurship, both by increasing firm entry and reducing failure. The results also indicate negative externalities upon low-tech and competing industries: the arrival of inventors in a county shifts the locus of venture capital investment away from low-tech startups to high-tech startups and moreover towards new ventures in the same sector as those inventors\u2019 skills. Identification is provided by a shift-share instrument combining the spatial distribution of surnames in the 1940 U.S. Census with thousands of surname-specific shifts based on modern inventor mobility.\n\n",
