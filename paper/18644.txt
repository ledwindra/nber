Carry Trade and Systemic Risk: Why are FX Options so Cheap?

NBER Working Paper No. 18644
December 2012
JEL No. F31,G01,G15
ABSTRACT
In this paper we document first that, in contrast with their widely perceived excess returns, popular
carry trade strategies yield low systemic-risk-adjusted returns. In particular, we show that carry trade
returns are highly correlated with the return of a VIX rolldown strategy —i.e., the strategy of shorting
VIX futures and rolling down its term structure— and that the latter strategy performs at least as well
as beta-adjusted carry trades, for individual currencies and diversified portfolios. In contrast, hedging
the carry with exchange rate options produces large returns that are not a compensation for systemic
risk. We show that this result stems from the fact that the corresponding portfolio of exchange rate
options provides a cheap form of systemic insurance.

Introduction
The high returns of the forex carry trade —i.e., investing in high interest rate currencies

and funding it with low interest currencies— has led to an extensive literature documenting
the “puzzle” and its robustness to a wide variety of controls.1 This carry trade premium
is not explained by traditional risk factors, such as those suggested by Fama and French
(1993).2 Moreover, several recent works have examined whether carry returns can be explained by crash risk and concluded that it cannot. Most prominently, Burnside, Eichenbaum, Kleshchelski et al. (2011) find that hedging the carry with ATM FX options leaves
its returns unchanged, and therefore conclude that the crash risk exposure is not the source
of the premium.3
The main contribution of this paper is to turn the puzzle on its head. We reconcile the
past findings by showing that while the standard carry trade is essentially compensation for
systemic risk, the corresponding bundle of crash protection FX options are puzzlingly cheap.
In particular, we show that carry trade returns are highly correlated with the returns of a
VIX rolldown strategy —i.e., the strategy of shorting VIX futures and rolling down its term
structure— for individual currencies as well as for diversified portfolios.4 We find that while
typical carry trade strategies produce large returns, this is explained by its comovement with
VIX rolldowns. On the other hand, portfolios of exchange rate options designed to hedge
the carry provide a cheap form of systemic risk insurance. As a result, when the carry trade
is hedged with exchange rate options, its average return remains strongly significant even
after controlling for its exposure to VIX rolldowns.
1

The profitability of the carry trade strategy stems from the fact that high interest rate currencies tend
to appreciate rather than depreciate, in constrast with the most basic implication of the uncovered interest
parity condition.
2
See, e.g., Table 4 from Burnside, Eichenbaum, Kleshchelski et al. (2011).
3
Farhi et al. (2009) uses currency options data to estimate that crash risk may account for roughly 25%
of carry returns in developed countries, leaving plenty of the carry return unexplained.
4
The VIX is an S&P500 implied volatility index, which is often described as the “global (financial) fear”
indicator.

As a preview of our results, we run regressions of the form

z̄t = α + xt β + et

where z̄t are the excess returns to a carry trade portfolio and xt are the excess returns to
VIX rolldowns.5 Figure 1 plots the cumulative returns to carry strategies that place equal
weights on each of the 25 countries in our sample against the required returns based on
their exposure to VIX rolldowns.6 Panel A shows the results for the standard carry, and
Panel B is for the carry when hedged with at-the-money exchange rate options. Each panel
includes two series:

Qt

j=1 (1 + z̄j ) − 1 (“Realized”) and

Qt

j=1





1 + xj β̂j−1 − 1 (“Required”).

While the unhedged carry does only marginally better than its required returns, the hedged
carry beats its systemic counterpart by more than a factor of 10. For the unhedged carry,
the annualized Sharpe ratio is 0.47, below the 0.57 of its required returns. But for hedged
carry, the realized Sharpe ratio of 0.79 is nearly 40% higher than the 0.57 earned by its
required returns. This suggests that exchange rate options earn a significant premium above
that which would be required based on their systemic exposure. Indeed, we find that after
controlling for its systemic exposure, the portfolio of carry protection options alone earns a
Sharpe ratio of 1.19, and we thus conclude that such a portfolio of exchange rate options is
a cheap form of systemic insurance.

Our work is directly related to a long literature that documents the puzzlingly high
returns to the carry trade. This literature includes dozens, if not hundreds, of papers.
Perhaps the most influential paper is Fama (1984) while Engel (1996) provides an excellent
survey. Burnside, Eichenbaum, Kleshchelski et al. (2011) confirms that these findings hold
in more recent data and with updated models and risk-factors. Focusing on the crosssection, Lustig and Verdelhan (2007) show that low interest rate currencies provide a hedge
for domestic consumption growth risk, and this can explain why these currencies do not
appreciate as much as the interest rate differential. However, Burnside (2007) shows that
such a model does not have significant β 0 s and leaves a large unexplained intercept term,
5

both of which are primary objects of our analysis.
Our findings also relate to a more recent literature that points to crash risk as a potential
explanation for average carry returns. Jurek (2009) and Burnside, Eichenbaum, Kleshchelski
et al. (2011) find that carry returns remain high even if one purchases crash protection via put
options. Brunnermeier et al. (2009) shows that there is a strong relationship between carry
return skewness and interest rate differentials, providing evidence that sudden exchange rate
moves may be due to the reduction in carry positions as traders near constraints. Further,
they find that increases in VIX coincide with reductions in carry positions, and a higher level
of VIX predicts higher future carry returns. Focusing on the cross-section, Menkhoff et al.
(2011) shows that there is a strong relationship between interest rates and global volatility
measures. Finally, Lustig et al. (2010) shows that US business cycle indicators help predict
foreign exchange returns.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces notation and
discusses the basics of the carry trade. Section 3 describes the details of the theory that
underlies our empirical approach. Section 4 provides a description of our data. Section 5
describes our results for the period leading up to the 2008 crisis and section 6 presents the
results for the entire sample.

Carry Trade Basics
In this section, we describe standard carry trade strategies and introduce notation. For

now, it is convenient to imagine that there are only two countries: the US (domestic) and
foreign. Both countries issue sovereign risk-free bonds and have independent currencies. In
the US, bonds pay an interest rate of rt and abroad they pay rt∗ . Imagine also that there
are only two periods, today and tomorrow. Let St be the exchange rate today and Ft be the
forward exchange rate at which one can agree to make a currency exchange tomorrow. Both
St and Ft are in terms of US dollars (USD) per foreign currency units (FCU). Without loss
6

of generality assume that rt < rt∗ . An obvious trading strategy for a US investor today is to
borrow $1 at the low domestic interest rates, convert the borrowed USD to FCU, and lend
those FCU to a foreigner at the higher interest rate. Since the investor borrows domestically,
USD is referred to as the funding currency while FCU is the investment currency. Today
the investor will have no net cash flows since he immediately lends all of his newly borrowed
funds. Tomorrow the foreigner will pay him

(1+rt∗ )
St

in FCU, and he will pay back (1 + rt )

in USD. Since both interest rates are risk-free, the investor only faces risk from changes in
the exchange rate. In order to perfectly hedge against FX risk, he could simply purchase a
forward contract. Doing that, tomorrow he would receive the risk-free payment of Ft

(1+rt∗ )
St

in USD. Since this strategy is both costless and riskless, any profits would be pure arbitrage.
Therefore the following arbitrage condition is expected to be satisfied most of the time:7

Ft

(1 + rt∗ )
= 1 + rt
St

This is known as the covered interest parity condition (CIP). In particular, it states that

ft − st = ret − ret∗
where ft = log(Ft ), st = log(St ), ret = log(1 + rt ), and ret∗ = log(1 + rt∗ ). The quantity ft − st
is commonly referred to as the average forward discount, and we write AF Dt = ft − st .
The carry trade is a simple risky variant on this strategy where the investor elects not to
purchase the forward FX contract in the hope that the USD will not appreciate by enough
to eliminate his entire profits. Denote the net payoff from this strategy by

Πt+1 = St+1
7

(1 + rt∗ )
− (1 + rt )
St

In practice, this condition can break down during episodes of severe financial distress.

7

Using CIP, this can be rewritten as

Πt+1 =

(1 + rt∗ )
(St+1 − Ft )
St

That is, the carry trade strategy is equivalent to buying

(1+rt∗ )
St

FCU forward. The investor

will make profits on average as long as Et (St+1 ) > Ft , and will only lose money if the USD
appreciates to the point that St+1 < Ft . In what follows, we will focus on the simpler and
more commonly employed version of the carry trade where the investor buys 1 FCU forward.
We define the excess return to this strategy as

zt+1 =

3

St+1
− 1.
Ft

Risk-based Explanations
As discussed in the introduction, empirical research has found the carry trade to pro-

duce puzzlingly high returns to investors. In principle, these returns could simply represent
compensation for some form of risk, but it has proven difficult to identify which risks are relevant. In this section we describe a simple and standard framework for assessing risk-based
explanations, which we will rely upon for our analysis.
Standard models of asset prices can be reduced to the specification of an asset pricing
kernel, Mt+1 , such that
Et [Mt+1 Rt+1 ] = 0
holds for any excess return Rt+1 denominated in USD. Plugging in zt+1 = Rt+1 , we see that
Et [Mt+1 St+1 ]
= Ft
Et [Mt+1 ]

8

which implies
Et [St+1 ] = Ft −

Covt [Mt+1 , St+1 ]
.
Et [Mt+1 ]

The historical literature, surveyed by Engle (1996), focuses on the special case where
Covt [Mt+1 , St+1 ] = 0. In that case, the forward rate is an unbiased predictor of the future
spot rate, and the average excess carry return is zero. Both of these hypotheses have been
consistently rejected empirically where researchers have estimated the regression

Et [

F t − St
St+1 − St
]=α+β
St
St

and rejected the hypothesis that α = 0 and β = 1. This is commonly referred to as the
forward premium puzzle. In fact, estimates of β are often negative, implying that high
interest rate currencies actually tend to appreciate, exactly the opposite from what would
be expected.
Allowing for non-zero correlation between exchange rates and the pricing kernel opens
the door for risk-based explanations. Rewriting things slightly, one can see that

E[Zt+1 ] =

Cov[Mt+1 , zt+1 ]
V ar[Mt+1 ]

!

V ar[Mt+1 ]
−
E[Mt+1 ]

!

or
E[zt+1 ] = β̃ λ̃
ar[Mt+1 ]
where β̃ is the slope coefficient from the regression of zt on Mt and λ̃ = − VE[M
. Next if
t+1 ]

Mt+1 = a + bxt+1 where xt+1 is an excess return, then

λ̃ = bE [xt+1 ] .

9

Therefore,
e = βE [x ]
E[zt+1 ] = βeλ
t+1

where β = bβ̃. In other words, the model predicts that if one runs the regression of zt =
α + βxt + t , one should find that α = 0.8 Here α is the portion of the excess return zt
that remains after controlling for its exposure to the factors xt . The quantities zt − β̂xt
are commonly referred to as the pricing errors from the model where β̂ is the coefficient
estimated by OLS. The goal then becomes identifying a set of excess returns xt that have
this property. The classical example of this approach is Fama and French (1993) which shows
that a set of three factors that do a very good job of pricing US equities. In this project, we
consider using excess returns on VIX futures to price currency forwards.

Data
We obtained daily closing spot and forward exchange rates from Datastream for 67 coun-

tries in terms of USD/FCU. Data on VIX futures prices and the underlying index were also
taken from Datastream. Our sample covers the period from March 26, 2004 when VIX futures started trading, to August 24, 2012. While FX forward rates trade for each horizon on
every day, VIX futures only trade for fixed maturity dates. For each VIX futures contract, we
find the trading day such that the maturity date of the contract is the same as the maturity
date for the FX forward rates.9 Since there is never more than one VIX futures expiration
date in a single month, this procedure creates approximately non-overlapping holding periods at the one month horizon. In total, we have 96 observations for each country. We also
employ daily data on the Fama-French three factors for the same period, which were obtained
from Kenneth French’s website. Daily returns are compounded to match the holding periods
8

Tests of this form were first proposed by Black, Jensen, and Scholes (1972).
In cases when there is no exact match, we use the trading day such that the maturities are as close
together as possible. They never differ by more than one day.

under consideration. Our primary analysis focuses on a set of relatively developed countries,
the Expanded Majors as defined by Bloomberg, and we exclude the countries from this set
which do not have floating exchange rates.10 This leaves us with a total of 25 countries in
our primary sample.11
We also collected daily data on the implied volatilities of at-the-money (spot) exchange
rate options with a one month horizon from Datastream for 22 out of the 25 countries in our
primary sample.12 We convert implied volatilities into prices using the Black-Scholes model.
Our options data covers the same period as our other data, and thus contains 96 monthly
observations.13
We consider two different periods of time for our analysis. For comparability with the
literature, our primary period of interest includes only the dates in our sample prior to the
financial crisis of 2008 (pre-crisis).14 We also focus on this period because in all likelihood
the full sample dramatically overstates the probability of a catastrophic downturn in financial markets. However, we will show that the results from the pre-crisis period carry over
qualitatively into the full sample period.

Carry Trade and Systemic Risk: Pre-Crisis

5.1

Traditional Carry Trade Portfolios

In this section, we begin by presenting results for the typical diversified carry trade
strategies that have been the focus of much of the recent literature. These are portfolios of
10

We follow the IMF’s classification of currencies, which is available at its website. We include only
currencies which are classified by the IMF as either “Independently floating” or “Managed Floating with no
pre-determined path for the exchange rate.”
11
Our primary sample of currencies includes AUD, BRL, CAD, CHF, CLP, COP, CZK, EUR, GBP, HUF,
IDR, ILS, INR, KRW, MXN, NOK, NZD, PEN, PLN, SEK, SGD, TRY, TWD, USD, ZAR.
12
The three excluded currencies are CZK, HUF, and PEN. Options pricing data for NZD were not available
after February 2012.
13
Implied volatility data for TRY is missing for the first two observations in the sample.
14
Specifically, we include monthly holding periods ending on May 19, 2004 through August 20, 2008 and
only for those months when VIX futures contracts expired. This leaves a total of 48 observations.

11

dynamically optimized carry strategies that are long a currency’s forward whenever rt∗ > rt
and short otherwise.15 We follow Burnside, Eichenbaum, Kleshchelski et al. (2011) and
others in using equally weighted baskets (EQL) with USD as the base currency. However, as
pointed out by Jurek (2009), using interest rate spreads as portfolio weights (SPD) tends to
produce higher returns, and the results may vary substantially for different base currencies.
Therefore, we also consider equal- and spread-weighted portfolios of JPY-based carry and
currency neutral carry.16 Our primary goal is to examine to what extent these returns can
be explained by the excess returns to VIX futures. To that end, we run regressions of the
form
z̄t = α + xt β + et
where z̄t =

PN





∗
i=1 ωi sign ri,t − rt zi,t is the excess returns to the carry trade portfolio, i

indexes currencies, ω denotes portfolio weights, and xt is the excess returns to a long position
in VIX futures.
Table 1 summarizes the results from these regressions for the pre-crisis period. In every
case, the excess carry trade returns were highly significant, consistent with the findings of
Burnside, Eichenbaum, Kleshchelski et al. (2011). However, the exposure of these strategies
to systemic risk is evident from the also highly significant values of β in all regressions.
Importantly, after correcting for this risk exposure, we find little excess returns, as the
estimated α0 s are statistically indistinguishable from 0 in all but one case.17
We assess whether rt∗ > rt by looking at a currency’s average forward discount.
Following Jurek (2009), currency neutral carry portfolios are computed in the following way. First, two
sub-portfolios are formed one containing only those currencies with corresponding interest rates higher than
that of the US and the other with only lower interest rate currencies. The final portfolio is equally weighted
in these two sub-portfolios. The portfolio weighting scheme (EQL or SPD) refers to the weights used to
construct the sub-portfolios.
17
In the Appendix, we show that the results are robust to controlling for the Fama-French factors, and those
traditional risk factors alone cannot explain the carry, in line with the conclusions of Burnside, Eichenbaum,
Kleshchelski et al. (2011).

Figure 2 plots the average carry returns against the βi0 s for positions that are all short
the base currency (ie, the base currency is used as the funding currency). Note that this
differs from the main strategy that we consider which determines the investment currency
dynamically depending on the sign of the interest rate differential. Currencies which should
have been funding currencies against the base show up here with positive βi0 s. The evidence
that carry is closely related to systemic risk exposure is visible.
Figure 3 plots the T-statistics for average carry returns against the corresponding α0 s
for each country in our sample. Here, funding currencies are determined dynamically by the
sign of the interest rate differential. Results are shown separately when USD and JPY are
15

used as the base currency. In line with our portfolio regressions, the α0 s are almost uniformly
below the average carry returns across currencies. The pattern is most easily seen when JPY
is used as the base where all currencies have positive carry returns with 13 significant at the
10% level, but only 3 α0 s are significantly above 0 while 7 are actually negative.

Options Hedged Carry Trade

Up to now, we have shown that hedging the carry trade with a long position in VIX
rolldowns leaves investors with no significant excess returns. Next, we consider the natural alternative of hedging with exchange rate options. The strategy we examine involves
purchasing an ATM call option on any exchange rate where the carry trader holds a short
forward position and an ATM put on exchange rates where the carry trader is long. For
4 currencies in our sample (AUD, EUR, GBP, NZD), our options data is provided for the

17

USD/FCU rate. In those cases, we compute the options hedged carry trade returns as18

In all other cases, the options data is for the FCU/USD rate, so we compute returns as19

Our primary analysis involves the same regressions as before, but replacing zt with zth
as the dependent variable. Table 2 displays the results. Consistent with the findings of
Burnside, Eichenbaum, Kleshchelski et al (2011), hedging with FX options leaves a significant
carry return. In fact, the T-statistics increase by over 70% on average. Furthermore, such
hedging removes much of the trades’ systemic exposure, reducing β by over 60% on average
and leaving significant α0 s.

This is the same formula used to compute FX options hedged carry by Burnside, Eichenbaum, Kleshchelski et al (2011).

We compute this expression with St+1
in the denominator so that removing the options components
leaves the same unhedged returns from before.

We dissect these results further by separating currencies into interest rate quintiles that
are rebalanced every period. Figure 5 illustrates that the gains from hedging with options
comes primarily from the low interest rate quintiles. For the two lowest quintiles, the carry
trade returns were actually negative on average, but positive payoffs from options were
enough to outweigh those losses. Meanwhile, at the two highest quintiles, Sharpe ratios were
unchanged by hedging with options. In the α − space, the gains still come primarily at the
lowest quintiles where α0 s go from negative to positive. However, the highest quintiles also
experienced some gains via a reduction in systemic risk exposure. Since the lowest quintile
is comprised entirely of short positions in foreign currencies, we find that call options on
21

funding currencies are especially cheap as both overall (Panel A) and systemic (Panel B)
insurance.

A New Puzzle

Given our earlier results on the systemic exposure of unhedged carry returns, these findings on the options-hedged carry suggest that a strategy involving only foreign exchange
options designed to hedge carry returns may provide a cheap form of systemic insurance.
We test this claim in the context of our model by regressing the excess returns to FX options

23

on the excess returns to VIX rolldowns where the dependent variable is computed as

ztopt =




max{0,St −St+1 }−Pt

for those options quoted in FCU/USD. Estimates are contained in Table 3 for various portfolios of these options. In every case, the portfolio of options is significantly positively correlated
with a long position in VIX rolldowns. This is not surprising, as the options strategies are
designed to hedge the carry. However, the important result is that these portfolios have very
large α0 s that are strongly significant in all cases, indicating that they do indeed provide
(excessively) cheap systemic insurance.

That is, the new puzzle is that there is premium to selling systemic risk insurance, hedged
with currency options. The conventional carry trade is a form of selling systemic insurance,
24

which when hedged with FX-options generates an excess return. But the source of the excess
return is in the low cost of the hedge, not the high return of the carry itself.

Carry Trade and Systemic Risk: Full Sample
Having examined the properties of typical carry trade strategies when hedged with either

VIX futures or FX options during (relatively) normal times, it remains to be seen how these
hedges perform in a sample that contains a major financial turndown. In this section,
we explore this issue by using our full sample period that extends to August 2012 and
includes the major asset market collapse surrounding the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers
in 2008. Although there are some nuances, the core message of the previous section remains
unchanged.
Table 4 presents our factor regressions for the unhedged carry over this period. As noted
earlier, our full sample overstates the empirical frequency of crises, and the result is that
we do not see the strikingly positive carry trade returns as in the pre-crisis period or as has
been documented for longer periods of time in previous work. On the other hand, as in the
pre-crisis period, the exposure of the carry to systemic risk remains strongly significant in all
cases, and taking this exposure into account leaves the carry with broadly reduced returns
and T-statistics. The JPY based carry even underperforms relative to its systemic exposure.
Figure 6 shows that these results are true at the currency level as well where 21 out of 25
JPY based and 11 out of 25 USD based currency carry trades underperform.

Turning next to the options hedged carry, regression results are shown in Table 5.20
As before, the hedged carry is significant and remains so after correcting for its systemic
exposure. This happens even though the unhedged carry is not broadly significant. On
average, the T-statistics for the hedged carry are nearly double those for the unhedged carry.
Currency level regressions confirm these results where all but 6 currencies’ T-statistics were
higher for their hedged strategy, as illustrated in Figure 7.
20

We drop NZD from the hedged carry sample, as its data series was not available after February 2012.
Including NZD and data only through February 2012 has little impact on our results.

Figure 8 plots the returns and α0 s separately for each interest rate quintile, illuminating
a somewhat different pattern from pre-crisis. Whereas in pre-crisis the gains from hedging
were only present for lower interest rate quintiles, in the full sample they exist for all interest
rate quintiles. Panel B reveals a similar pattern in the α-space. While three quintiles
of the unhedged carry actually underperformed their exposure, all quintiles of the hedged
carry outperformed. We also plot the cumulative returns to the two strategies in Figure 9.
Interestingly, while the gains from hedging came largely from increased expected returns for
lower quintiles, the gains for high quintiles were entirely from reduced volatility.

Finally, we implement our direct test of whether the appropriately constructed bundle

Final Remarks
To summarize, we find that after appropriately hedging the carry trade with VIX roll-

downs in both samples that exclude and include crises, there is no evidence that its return is
particularly large, and in the latter, there is evidence that it may actually be too small. This
contrasts with Burnside, Eichenbaum, Kleshchelski et al (2011) who find that the returns
to the carry trade are not a compensation for risk. On the other hand, like those previous
authors, we find that when the carry is hedged with FX options, it does indeed produce
significantly positive returns for which we have no risk-based explanation. Taken jointly,
our two sets of results suggest that portfolios of FX options designed to hedge the carry
trade provide a relatively cheap means of hedging systemic risk, and our tests confirm this
hypothesis.
Put differently, the new puzzle is that there is a premium to selling systemic risk insurance, hedged with currency options. The conventional carry trade is a form of selling
systemic insurance, which when hedged with FX options generates an excess return. But
the source of the excess return is in the low cost of the hedge, not the high return of the

39

carry itself.

Carry Trade and Fama-French Risk Factors: Pre-Crisis

In this section, we analyze the exposure of the equally weighted carry to the traditional FamaFrench risk factors (MKT, SMB, HML), as studied in Burnside, Eichenbaum, Kleshchelski
et al. (2011). In the pre-crisis period, the estimates confirm that the carry trade is not
significantly exposed to these traditional factors, and controlling for them leaves a significant excess return. Furthermore, we find that even after controlling for the Fama-French
factors, the carry remains significantly exposed to VIX rolldowns, and the resulting α is still
insignificant.
