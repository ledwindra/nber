Introduction

Emerging economies are prone to crises triggered by external shocks. During these crises,
should the central bank stabilize the value of its currency or domestic interest rates? If the
choice is outside the central bank’s control, as in a currency board, are there good policy
substitutes?
Uniformly, the analysis of these questions begins by describing the external shock as an
upward shift in the interest parity condition: a rise in the country-premium or international
interest rate. We depart at the outset and argue that for most emerging economies, this
“horizontal” approximation of the external supply of funds (unlimited funds available at a
high and fixed price) is misleading for the questions at hand. The proposition, implicit in
this view, that an emerging economy mired in an external crisis could attract capital flows
by adopting an expansionary monetary policy, seems counterfactual at best.
Instead, what is needed is a “vertical" approximation, where the supply of funds is inelastic during the crisis as the country faces an international liquidity constraint. In this
context, monetary policy predominantly affects the domestic cost of the scarce international
liquidity. Expansionary monetary policy brings about a sharp overshooting in the exchange
rate depreciation, without any substantial gain in terms of real activity. In contrast, conservative monetary policy stabilizes the exchange rate, with little additional output loss.
A modern central bank concerned with its inflation target will respond to this asymmetry
by tightening during the crisis. The vertical view thereby accounts naturally for the widely
observed “fear of floating” among emerging economies.1
While a contractionary monetary policy may appear as optimal during the crisis, it is
not from an ex-ante perspective as it exacerbates the structural underinsurance problem
that afflicts emerging economies. Quite the contrary, we show that if the central bank could
commit to a monetary policy, it should in most circumstances pledge expansionary policy
during external crises. Importantly, the optimality of the latter stems not from the impact
of monetary policy during a crisis, as the standard argument has it, but from the ex-ante
effect the policy has on the incentive to insure against episodes of international liquidity
scarcity.
When firms in need of international resources face domestic financial constraints, their
demand for international liquidity is constrained as well. In equilibrium, these domestic
financial constraints generate a wedge between the marginal value of the international re-

among emerging economies with flexible exchange rate regimes.

sources to the domestic firms and the market price of these resources. This underpricing
reduces the private sector’s incentive to carry international liquidity into crisis-states and
hence insure against crises (see Caballero and Krishnamurthy (2001a)). Expansionary monetary policy, while not directly alleviating the international financial constraint –the main
constraint during an external crisis– increases domestic liquidity and hence the private
reward of maintaining international liquidity. Thus in the vertical view, the only role of
monetary policy is to affect the private sector’s incentives to manage international liquidity.
The time consistency problem that arises in the vertical context, coupled with the institutional conservatism of modern independent central banks, suggests that in practice
monetary policy will be rarely used for incentive purposes. This bias increases the underinsurance problem, in particular in those economies with more limited financial development
(i.e. where firms face tighter financial constraints). The silver lining for these economies
is that there are substitutes for the international liquidity management role of monetary
policy. Since the primitive problem is one of underinsurance, either direct or indirect exante measures that induce the economy to carry more international liquidity into crises
states reduce the underinsurance problem. For example, an active international reserve
management, capital controls, or procyclical international liquidity ratio requirements, can
all substitute for monetary policy. Conversely, a credible commitment to a countercyclical
monetary policy during crises is a good substitute for costly capital controls and ex-ante
measures.
The distinction we draw between international and domestic liquidity, coupled with the
association of monetary policy to the latter, also offers a different perspective on several issues related to liquidity policy within different exchange rate regimes. The loss of monetary
policy in a currency board or other inflexible exchange rate systems, somewhat paradoxically, is not a serious impediment during crises. Monetary policy does little to relax the
binding international financial constraint and thus is largely irrelevant. The problem with a
currency board is instead due to the perverse ex-ante effects that the lack of credit expansion
during a crisis generates; As before, these can be handled with ex-ante measures.2 Within
our perspective, international contingent credit lines are desirable regardless of the exchange
rate regime, and thus should not be thought of as a substitute for domestic monetary policy in a dollarized economy. They are primarily about relaxing international rather than
Our analysis is meant to isolate the liquidity and financial market aspects of monetary policy. In so
doing, we eliminate the important but better understood goods-labor markets dimensions of monetary and
exchange rate policy. All our remarks must be understood in this context. We briefly return to these issues
in the conclusion.

domestic financial constraints, and it is the latter rather than the former that differentiates
flexible and fixed exchange rate regimes from a liquidity management perspective.3
Section 2 presents the basic model and highlights the differences between the traditional horizontal and the vertical analyses, including the natural emergence of exchange
rate overshooting and the related fear of floating. Our model is designed to establish a
clear distinction between two forms of liquidity (collateral): international and domestic.
The vertical view highlights the fact that during external crises it is the former that is
binding and hence measures to relax the latter –such as monetary policy– cannot have
a significant immediate impact. The horizontal perspective, on the other hand, draws no
distinction between these two forms of liquidity.
Section 3 asks how ex-ante private sector financing decisions are affected by ex-post policy measures and, in turn, how this answer leads to the design of optimal policies. We show
that domestic financial underdevelopment implies that in equilibrium the private sector undervalues international liquidity and insurance. A credible commitment to a countercyclical
monetary policy reduces the extent of this undervaluation. While this would appear to be
a damaging criticism of dollarized regimes, we argue that this need not be the case since
the primitive problem is one of distorted incentives rather than one of insufficient domestic
liquidity, and the former can be resolved by alternative means.
Section 4 summarizes our message in the context of a standard political economy discussion of rules-versus-discretion. We show that while in the horizontal perspective there is a
standard tension between inflation bias and ex-post inflexibility, in the vertical perspective
there is neither an inflation bias nor an advantage of ex-post flexibility. Quite the contrary,
if it were at all possible, commitment in the vertical region would require the central bank
to be less conservative than it will be inclined to be during a crisis.
Section 5 concludes and is followed by two appendices. The first one contains the
proofs of our main propositions. The second one is more substantive. While the interaction
between financial market development and international liquidity is explicitly modeled in
the main text, the monetary channel we superimpose on it is reduced-form. The second
appendix sketches a debt-deflation model of this monetary channel.
See the recent work by Diamond and Rajan (2001) for a related perspective on financial crises based
on two potentially binding constraints: a solvency and a liquidity constraint. Their analysis focuses on the
ex-post effect of interventions during crises and, in particular, on the perils of policies that fail to identify
the binding constraint during the crisis.

The Vertical View and the Fear of Floating

In this section we describe the environment and discuss the difference between horizontal
and vertical views of crises. We show that when domestic financial markets are illiquid, the
vertical view implies that the exchange rate overshoots in response to monetary policy and
central banks are naturally led to adopt a fear of floating strategy.
2.1

Basic setup

We study an economy exposed to an external financial crisis, triggered by the rise of the
country’s risk-adjusted international cost of capital.4 The crisis occurs at date 1, and
is followed by a final date 2 when firms’ repay their outstanding debts. We start time
with a date 0, which is a fully flexible period when agents make investment, financing,
and precautionary decisions. The periods are indexed by t = 0, 1, 2, and there is a single
(tradeable) good.
There is a unit measure of domestic firms, each endowed with w units of collateral,
in the form of receivables arriving at date 2. These date 2 goods have collateral value to
foreigners (e.g., prime exports), who are willing to lend against it at dates 0 and 1 at the
rate i∗0 and i∗1 from period 0 to 1, and 1 to 2, respectively. Foreigners play no other role in
our model.
Domestic firms also have access to a production technology. Building a plant of size k at
date 0 requires them to invest c(k) – with c(.) ≥ 0, c > 0 and c > 0 – which yields date
2 output proportional to the size of the plant (see below). Since domestic firms have no
resources at date 0, they must import the capital goods and borrow from foreigners, d0,f ,
to finance this investment. The financing and investment decisions are taken to maximize
expected plant profits at date 2. To keep matters simple, we shall assume that each firm
is run by a domestic entrepreneur/manager who has risk neutral preferences over date 2
consumption of the single good.
Firms face significant financial constraints. Neither the plants nor their expected output
are valued as collateral by foreigners. When real investments are undertaken, firms mortgage
a part of their international collateral in securing foreign funds. All financing is done via
fully collateralized debt contracts, thus, d0,f ≤ w.
4

Nearly the same analysis applies to a sharp decline in terms of trade that makes financial constraints

binding.

2.2

Date 1 financing needs and Crises

For the remainder of the section, let us take as given all date 0 decisions – k and d0,f – and
focus on the crisis period. We define a crisis as an event in which a rise in the international
lending rate, i∗1, causes financial constraints to bind for firms. Let us now turn to defining
the financing need and explaining how financial constraints may come to bind.
In our economy the financing need stems from the normal ongoing maintenance of the
productive structure. We capture this feature by simply assuming that the plants of onehalf of the firms receive a production shock at date 1 that lowers output per plant from A
to a. This productivity decline can be offset by reinvesting θk (θ ≤ 1) goods, to give date
2 output of,
Ã(θ)k = (a + θ ∆)k ≤ Ak,
where
∆ ≡ A − a.
We assume that the return on reinvestment exceeds the international interest rate: ∆−1 >
i∗
1 . This means that firms will borrow as much as possible to finance reinvestment. We shall
say that a crisis occurs if firms are curtailed in their date 1 reinvestment, θ < 1, despite the
fact that ∆−1 > i∗1. If this is the case, then firms are financially constrained at date 1. Our
assumptions on parameters are such that this is the case in equilibrium (see the appendix).
A firm that receives an idiosyncratic shock is said to be distressed. To cope with the
shock, the firm first borrows against its net international collateral:
w

n

≡ w − d0,f

directly from foreigners. After this, it must turn to the domestic firms that did not receive
a shock (“intact firms”) for funds. Intact firms have no output at date 1 either, so they
must borrow from foreigners if they are to finance the distressed firms. This they can do
up to their wn of financial slack.
But why would intact firms lend to distressed firms any more than foreigners? We
assume that domestics value as collateral the firm’s installed assets as well. However, since
a perfectly functioning domestic financial market is hardly a good description of an emerging
economy either, and this departure has central implications for our analysis, we assume that
only a fraction of the output from domestic investment can be pledged to other domestics.
It will simplify the formulae, without loss of insight, to make this a fraction of minimum
output: λak. Since firms can use this collateral to borrow up to this amount, we refer to
λak as domestic liquidity.5 Likewise, since at date 1 firms can borrow from foreigners up to
5

Since we do not want insurance markets to undo the ex-post heterogeneity, we assume that idiosyncratic

shocks are non-observable and non-contractible. Moreover, we assume that the coordination-fragile ex-ante
pooling equilibrium is not feasible (see Caballero and Krishnamurthy (2001b)).

5

of international collateral, we refer to wn as the international liquidity during the crisis.
After pledging wn to foreigners, distressed firms pledge their λak to intact domestics,
who in turn pledge their wn to foreigners to access foreign funds. All direct borrowing from
foreigners is done at the interest rate of i∗1.

2.3

The (standard) Horizontal View

In the standard horizontal view, distressed firms are constrained in meeting their financing
needs only to the extent that they have limited collateral. They have total collateral of
λak + wn which they borrow against at the interest rate of i∗
1.
Translated into our context, the horizontal view implicitly assumes that the country as
a whole, at the margin, has an international liquidity slack. In other words, a foreigner
would be willing to extend another loan at i∗1 to some domestic firm. But since distressed
firms have limited collateral, it happens that the worthy firm is not distressed.
In our model, since intact firms borrow from foreigners against wn and lend to distressed
firms against λak, there is excess international liquidity if,
1 n 1
(1)
2 w > 2 λak.
Since intact firms are not saturating their international financial constraint, the interest rate
they charge on the loan to a distressed firm, against domestic collateral of λak, is simply
determined by the arbitrage condition:
d
i1

= i∗1.

Total reinvestment is then determined by the individual firms’ financial constraints:

where the superscript h denotes the horizontal equilibrium. The inequality in the main
expression reflects that the economy has not used all its international liquidity, while θh < 1
indicates that the economy is in a crisis: distressed firms are unable to meet all financing
needs because of the binding financial constraint.
We refer to this as the horizontal view, because the price of loans is not affected by
the quantity of them. A distressed firm could in principle continue borrowing at the given
interest rate i∗1, as long as its domestic financial constraint is relaxed. Thus, if we imagine
an experiment where λ is raised slightly, we would relax the domestic collateral constraint,
leading to increased loans at i∗1 and increased reinvestment. We return to this discussion
after introducing the vertical view.
6

2.4

The Vertical View

In this view, the international supply of funds that is faced by emerging economies during
external crises is vertical — i.e. inelastic.6 The country has enough domestic collateral to
aggregate the international liquidity available to agents in the economy, so that inequality
(1) is reversed:
1 wn < 1 λak.
2
2

However, there is insufficient international liquidity in the aggregate to raise finance for all
of the economy’s needs so that the economy is still in a crisis:
k

wn

2 1 + i∗1 .
>

When the above conditions hold, the interest rate on loans against domestic collateral
departs from i∗1 (see the appendix for restrictions on primitives). Since intact firms, and not
foreigners, accept as collateral the λak, and intact firms are borrowing up to their maximum
capacity from foreigners and lending to distressed firms, the domestic price of a dollar-loan,
∗
id
1 , rises above i1 :
d
∗
i1 > i1 .

Importantly, the fact that the international liquidity constraint is binding at the margin
does not mean that the domestic collateral problems that dominate the horizontal approach
disappear. This observation will be central in understanding the desirability and impact of
monetary policy. As we show below, as long as domestic firms continue to be credit constrained, the domestic (dollar) interest rate is less than the marginal product of investment
for the distressed firm:
d
i1 <

∆ − 1.

This is the rate at date 1 on a one-period domestic loan against a unit of domestic
collateral, and is both the dollar cost of capital for firms in need of funds, as well as the
expected return on loans for domestic lenders. It is determined by both, the amount of
collateral of distressed firms and the amount of international liquidity of intact ones. The
aggregate collateral of distressed firms is λak/2. Thus they pledge λak/2 of date 2 goods to
intact firms in exchange for date 1 goods of wn/2. If domestic collateral is not too limited,
there is a scarcity price for the international liquidity, and the price needed to clear the
domestic loan market, id1, will exceed the international interest rate, i∗:
d
i1
6

∗
= wn/λak
(1 + i∗) − 1 > i1.

See Caballero and Krishnamurthy (2001a).

(3)

This expression highlights the effect of domestic collateral and international liquidity on
date 1 cost of capital. A shortage of the latter means that id1 > i∗1; while a shortage of the
former means that the cost of capital will generally be less than the marginal product of
investment at date 1 (∆): id1 < ∆ − 1.
In other words, in the aggregate, a shortage of international liquidity yields a spread
between domestic marginal product and international cost of capital. Domestic collateral,
on the other hand, determines the sharing of this spread between domestic lenders and
borrowers of a marginal dollar.
In this region, domestic collateral plays no role in determining aggregate reinvestment.
In equilibrium, all international liquidity is aggregated, so that reinvestment is:

Figure 1: Vertical and Horizontal Supply

As an introduction to our discussion of monetary policy, the main distinction between
the vertical and horizontal views can be seen by considering the experiment of increasing
8

(boosting domestic collateral) by a small amount. Figure 1 illustrates this difference.
On the vertical axis we measure the domestic dollar-interest rate on loans against domestic
collateral. On the horizontal axis we capture domestic loans or domestic reinvestment. The
solid flat-and-then-vertical curve correspond to the supply of loans from intact firms. d and
d represent effective (collateralized) loan demand from distressed firms in regions where
the supply is horizontal (d) and vertical (d).
Note that in the horizontal case a shift in demand (say by increasing λ) raises date 1
investment, while leaving the domestic price of loans unaffected. On the other hand, in the
vertical region, an increase in d has no effect on equilibrium investment, and instead only
pushes up the domestic interest rate of id1 .
Let us take a reduced form approach to monetary policy whereby the central bank can
indeed affect λ (see the appendix for an explicit model of this channel). The central bank
chooses a combination of peso-interest rates, ip1, and expected appreciations, (e1 −e2), traced
by the (domestic) interest parity condition:7
λ

d
i1

= ip1 + (e1 − 1),

where λ can be written as λ(ip1, e1), and without loss of generality, we have set e2 = 1.
Most models with a monetary channel yield λip1 < 0, while the sign of λe1 varies across
models and scenarios. However, as long as the latter is positive, or not too negative,
an expansionary monetary policy (i.e., a reduction in domestic peso-rates) also expands
domestic collateral by raising λ.
We will take the above configuration as our reference case, although in the conclusion
we discuss briefly the case of λe << 0 –perhaps capturing an extensive dollarization of
domestic liabilities– as this is one of the main reasons given in the literature to prefer
constrained monetary regimes over more flexible monetary arrangements.8 It is important
to notice, nonetheless, that our main argument is very distinct from the issues raised in this
debate.
The tradeoff of the monetary authority in the horizontal perspective can be understood
in this context. An expansionary monetary policy relaxes the domestic financial constraint
(increases λ), and by doing so it increases investment (see (2)):

∂λ

By domestic interest parity condition we mean the relationship between the return on peso and dollar

instruments backed by domestic collateral. See appendix A3.

See, e.g., Aghion et al (2000), Gertler et al. (2001), Cespedes et al. (2000), and Christiano et al. (2000).}

9

The standard tradeoff is that this investment increase must be weighed against the
inflationary costs brought about by the monetary expansion and exchange rate depreciation.
In the midst of a crisis, and within a reasonable range, the latter costs are likely to be
dominated by the output gains of the expansionary policy.9
Our main results in this section follow directly from noticing that the weights in the
above tradeoff change abruptly in the vertical region. This happens for two important
and closely related reasons. First, since the main binding constraint is the international as
opposed to the domestic collateral constraint, relaxing the latter does not affect reinvestment
and output (see (4)):
v
∂θ k
∂λ

= 0.

Second, while all choices of ip1 and e1 that leave the economy in the vertical region yield
the same real investment decisions, they do not all lead to the same asset prices. In fact,
from (3) we see that id1 is increasing in λ:
∂id
1
∂λ

= wn/(1ak+ i∗) .

Thus a key difference from the horizontal region is that an increase in λ results in a shift
in the (domestically determined) interest parity condition. That is, in the vertical region
there are two effects of an expansionary monetary policy on the exchange rate that need to
be considered. There is the standard interest parity effect: Fixing id1 in,
p
i1

+ e1 − 1 = id1 > i∗1,

the exchange rate weakens by the same amount as the peso-interest rate is lowered. But at
this new point, λ rises as well. Since id1 is increasing in domestic collateral, the (domestic)
interest parity condition shifts upwards, and the exchange rate depreciates by a larger
amount.We refer to this phenomenon as exchange rate overshooting because, relative to the
horizontal region, in the vertical region peso-interest rate reductions lead to proportionately
larger depreciations in the exchange rate.
With little direct real consequences, monetary policy in the vertical region may be
dictated by secondary considerations (e.g., inflation targets). We take the widely observed
fear of floating to be an example of this. The central bank wishes to protect the exchange at
date 1 from the shock to i∗1. At date 1, the output costs to raising interest rates are minimal
9

In this sense, the monetary policy problem with financial frictions in the horizontal perspective is no

different from the standard closed economy problem applied to developed economies as in, e.g., Bernanke,
Gertler and Gilchrist (2000).

(beyond the direct costs of the external shock), and instead the action has a substantial
effect on the exchange rate. The logical conclusion is to raise interest rates, lowering λ to
the point where id1 = i∗1, and thereby defending the exchange rate.
Does this mean that emerging economies should abandon countercyclical monetary policy, making explicit what they have de-facto adopted through their fear of floating? This is
one of the main questions we turn to in the next section.

Optimal Policy Regime: The menu of date 0/date 1 measures

In the vertical view, international liquidity and hence the supply of external resources to the
country is predetermined during a crisis. There is nothing that a central bank, or private
agent, can do to alter this reality.
Date 0 actions, on the other hand, can affect the date 1 external position of the country.
In particular, we show that the anticipation of an expansionary date 1 monetary policy leads
to more efficient date 0 private sector decisions. But what if monetary policy is constrained
— as in a currency board? We argue that explicit date 0 measures can substitute for the
loss of monetary policy.
This section offers a menu of date 0/date 1 policies that are optimally taken together.
We also show that the conclusions one draws regarding optimal policy and the choice of
exchange rate regimes hinges crucially on separately identifying domestic and international
liquidity.
3.1

Structural Underinsurance and Optimal Monetary Policy Commitment

Let us revisit the private sector’s date 0 investment and financing decisions, taking the
date 1 policy of the central bank as given. Moreover, let us for now summarize the central
bank’s policy by the value λ takes, and disregard any decision that may arise from the
specific combination of (ip1, e1 ) that achieves this λ.
To make our points, we do not depend on the presence of aggregate shocks. We assume
that date 1 aggregate conditions are fully anticipated to be those of an external crisis –
that is, the economy will be in the vertical region, with binding financial constraints (see
the appendix for parameter conditions to arrive at this scenario).
Let us consider firms’ incentives to precaution against the date 1 crisis and, particularly,
11

how these incentives are affected by the domestic cost of capital, id1 . Precautioning is an exante decision to reduce date 0 investment, borrow less of d0,f and save this debt capacity for
the date 1 crisis. Equivalently this is a date 0 private decision to hoard some international
liquidity.
The net return on investing an extra unit of k for an intact firm is composed of two
pieces. On the gross return side, the firm obtains Ak goods at date 2. On the cost side,
it sacrifices (1 + i∗0)c (k) units of international liquidity which would have yielded a return
d
i1 in the domestic financial market at date 1. Thus, at the margin increasing k yields an
ex-post return, net of opportunity cost, of
A

− c(k)(1 + id1 )(1 + i∗0).

(5)

It follows immediately from (5) that the opportunity cost of increasing date 0 indebtedness is undervalued by an intact firm as long as id1 < ∆ − 1. Since the demand for date 1
external funds is constrained by the distressed firms’ limited domestic collateral, the value
of holding on to a unit of international liquidity in order to supply it to distressed firms at
date 1 is depressed relative to the socially efficient –and the distressed firm’s– valuation,
∆.
Now consider the same net return for a distressed firm. On the gross return side, at
the margin the firm obtains a unit of goods directly. But because a fraction λ of these
goods can be pledged as collateral in the domestic loan market at date 1, that fraction must
be multiplied by the private return that each generates (its value as a collateral asset). A
loan secured by λa goods at date 2, generates proceeds of 1+λaid1 goods at date 1, which
each can be reinvested at a gross return of ∆. Thus the gross benefit to increasing k is
(1 − λ)a + λa 1+∆id . On the cost side, it sacrifices (1 + i∗0 )c (k ) units of international liquidity
1
which yield a private return of ∆ to a distressed firm. Thus, at the margin increasing
investment in k yields a net return of:



a

∆
(1 − λ) + λ
1 + id1



− c (k)∆(1 + i∗0).

(6)

It follows immediately from (6) that while the cost of sacrificing a unit of international
liquidity is properly valued by a distressed firm, the domestic investment is not. As long as
d
i1 < ∆ − 1, a distressed firm is able to keep some of the surplus from reinvestment by selling
its overvalued domestic collateral. A central planner, on the other hand, realizes that during
an external crisis only international liquidity generates social surplus, and hence discounts
domestic assets at ∆ rather than (1 + id1 ).10
10

Since the analysis above takes date 0 decisions as given, the expected return on domestic loans splits the

12

Although for different reasons, both intact and distressed firms overvalue (from a social
point of view) domestic investment relative to its opportunity cost – namely its opportunity
cost in terms of the international liquidity used. Since the ex-ante decision is based on the
average of these two outcomes, it follows that firms will overinvest, overborrow and underprecaution for the date 1 shock.11
The over-borrowing problem is an equilibrium problem. It arises only in the vertical
region, as the supply of international funds faced by distressed firms is independent of
others’ actions in the horizontal region, and it stems from distorted asset prices due to
financial constraints — limited λak constrains demand so that id1 < ∆ − 1.
The optimal monetary policy commitment in the vertical region should be apparent by
now. Since increasing λ at date 1 increases id1 and reduces the spread between ∆ − 1 and
d
i1 , the distortion caused by limited domestic collateral falls as λ rises. Thus the optimal
monetary policy commitment is to ex-post (i.e., during the crisis) choose the maximum
possible λ.12
Aside from the standard inflationary concerns associated to the need for a very active
monetary policy, the contrast between ex-ante (countercyclical) and ex-post (pro-cyclical)
optimal policy during crises highlights an unusual commitment problem. The central bank
should certainly commit to not “fear floating,” but should ideally commit to exacerbate
the exchange rate depreciation during a crisis. If this is not credible, the incentive benefit
–its only benefit in the vertical world– of countercyclical monetary policy vanishes and
the cure for the structural underinsurance problem must be sought elsewhere. We return
to such an alternative after introducing constrained monetary regimes.
reinvestment surplus, ∆ − 1, between domestic lenders and borrowers but it does not affect the real side of
the economy. Total reinvestment is fully determined by the total availability of international liquidity (that
is, the sum of the international collateral available to distressed and intact firms):

(1 + i∗1 ) 12 θk = 12 (w − d0,f ) + 21 (w − d0,f ),
to imply (in a crisis):
θ

=2

w

− d0,f

(1 + i∗1 )k

<

1.

This dichotomy between the real and financial side disappears at date 0, when domestics make their investment and portfolio decisions. When a domestic decides to make a real investment, it also makes a financial
one. In particular, it gives up some of its international liquidity,

w,

in exchange for domestic collateral,

λak .

It is this financial decision that is affected by id1 .
11

This opens the door to international liquidity management policies, as we study in Caballero and Krish-

namurthy (2000a). See also Harberger (1985) and Aizenman (1989), for alternative models of over-borrowing
based on the undervaluation of the country’s monopsony power in international financial markets.

3.2

Constrained Monetary Regimes

One of the main criticisms of dollarization and other hard fixed exchange rate systems
is that the central bank is unable to implement countercyclical monetary policy. This
criticism would appear to be all the more damaging when financial accelerator mechanisms
are appended to standard arguments.13 As we have argued, however, this policy option has
little value at the time of a vertical crisis.
Under the vertical view, the concern with these type of exchange rate regimes is close
to that of the
criticism of fixed exchange rate systems, whereby the latter
is perceived as a central bank subsidy on dollar-borrowing.14 However in our model underinsurance does not stem from the fixed value of the exchange rate itself, but from the
central bank’s inability to optimally expand λ during crises and reward the hoarding of
scarce international liquidity. Thus, for example even in a flexible exchange rate system, if
policy is not sufficiently counter-cyclical, there will be the underinsurance problem.
There is a “silver-lining” for constrained monetary regimes in the above discussion. As
the problem of dollarization is shifted from an ex-post to an ex-ante distortion, a new set of
policy options emerges. Rather than seeking hard-to-find substitutes for monetary policy
during crises, the policymaker can introduce measures to solve the ex-ante underinsurance
problem directly.15
Recall that the problem induced by not being able to commit to expand credit at date
1 is that ∆ − (1 + id1 ) remains high, and thus the return to hoarding international liquidity
until date 1 remains undervalued. While in practice this undervaluation of international
liquidity may take many forms, in our simple model it is just high external leverage (high
16 In our environd0,f ) or, equivalently, excessive investment in domestic firms (high k).
ment, there are two obvious ex-ante policy measures that can deal with the underinsurance
problem: capital inflows taxation during normal times (date 0), and international liquidity
requirements at date 0.
These ex-ante options, of course, are also available in a flexible exchange rate system.

See, e.g., Gertler et al (2001) and Cespedes et al (2001).
See, e.g., Dooley (1999).
Note, however, that even hard currency board systems can effectively implement some degree of monetary

policy by, e.g., temporarily allowing domestic Treasury instruments denominated in dollars to count as
international reserves, or relaxing the banks international liquidity ratios, as Argentina has done over the
last decade.
16

With a slightly richer model, in Caballero and Krishnamurthy (2000a,2000b) we show that this un-

dervaluation also leads to increased dollarization of liabilities, increased short term debt, and insufficient
contingent lines.

14

To the extent that λ cannot move sufficiently at date 1 in order to align the date 0 problems
of the central planner and private sector, perhaps as a result of the commitment problems
discussed earlier, these measures are desirable. More generally, let us return to the analysis
of the previous subsection and characterize the relationship between the optimal ex-ante
tax and λ.
At the aggregate level, building a marginally larger plant always generates date 2 output
A
of +2 a . The opportunity cost of doing this is to save this international liquidity until date
1 at which point, since one of the distressed or intact firms will be reinvesting, the return
is c (k)(1 + i0)∆. In total, the social return is,


∗

A + a − c (k)(1 + i )∆.
(7)
0
2
Aligning the date 0 private and social incentives is a matter of choosing a tax/transfer
policy. Suppose that the central bank levies a tax τ per unit of k, which is returned to firms
in a lump sum fashion. Then, from (6) and (5), the private sector return to hoarding a unit
of international liquidity as opposed to investing it, is:


A + a (1 − λ) + λ ∆ − c (k)(1 + i ) ∆ + 1 + id1 − τ,
(8)
0

1 + id

1τ

where id1τ represents the new (after taxes) equilibrium cost of a domestic dollar-loan.
As we concluded earlier, if domestic financial markets are well developed or monetary
policy is powerful enough so that in the absence of taxes id1 = ∆ − 1, (7) and (8) coincide for
τ = 0 and there is no reason for intervention at date 0. If that is not the case, the optimal
tax must equate these two expressions. A few steps of algebra, and identifying the social
planner’s quantities with a hat, gives us that the optimal tax is:





n
τ = 21 w + c (k)(1 + i0 ) (∆ − (1 + id1,τ )),
k
which is clearly decreasing with respect to λ since:


∗

(9)


id1,τ = λ akn ,
w
and all the social planner’s quantities are independent of λ.
We think of the above as an “iso-international liquidity” menu: a schedule of (τ, λ) such
that the private sector and social incentives are aligned. Thus, for example, in the case of
a λ that cannot respond to external shocks, as is the case of a dollarized system, a positive
τ would be beneficial.
15

Of course, in practice taxes come with their own sets of distortions – deadweight costs
of taxation, costs of enforcement, evasion, etc. Moreover, a significant drawback of date
0 measures in our model is that if they are not fully reversed at date 1, the reduction in
date 1 international liquidity will more than undo the date 0 benefit of having the private
sector hoard liquidity. Thus these measures do require the authority to be very responsive
to economic conditions.
These issues, along with the credibility (see above) and inflationary problems of an
active monetary policy, need to be weighed in deciding which is the optimal exchange and
monetary policy arrangement in a specific country. Our main purpose in this section is
to point out the existence of a menu of options. In contrast to prevailing views, a fixed
exchange rate system is not strictly at a liquidity disadvantage to the flexible system. This
contrast arises from the fact that the prevailing wisdom is based on a domestic liquidity
perspective, while we argue that during severe crisis it is international rather than domestic
liquidity that matters the most.
3.3

International Credit Lines and Reserves

International credit lines are often perceived as a necessary supplement to constrained
monetary regimes. In a vertical framework, however, these lines are desirable regardless
of the exchange rate regime, and thus should not be thought of as a substitute for domestic
monetary policy in a dollarized economy. Since in a crisis the main binding constraint is
the international one, any effort to loosen this constraint is desirable.
Indeed, the usual view that credit lines are valuable in a currency board because they
allow for some ability to expand credit in crises and prevent bank runs is just a version
of this. This argument makes little sense in a horizontal view because, if it could, the
country would simply borrow the dollars to expand banking credit in crises. There would
be no need to have contracted ex-ante for a credit line. On the other hand, in the vertical
view, the country is internationally constrained in a crisis, thus the only policy that can
alleviate the problem are ex-ante measures to ease this constraint.17 The same logic applies
to international reserves magagement considerations.
17

International credit lines should in principle be contracted directly by the private sector, but the same

underinsurance problem we have highlighted in the core of the paper will limit the extent to which they
will do so (see Caballero and Krishnamurthy (2000a) for a related argument in the context of a sterilization
of capital inflows). Of course, if the central bank or government has access to international contingent
instruments that the private sector does not, it should use it. Again, however, this is true regardless of the
particular exchange rate arrangement in place, as it is justified by the vertical constraint rather than by the
lack of domestic monetary policy.

16

Political Economy

In the standard discussion of rules versus discretion in monetary policy, there is a fundamental tension between the inflation-bias costs and the ex-post flexibility benefits of discretion
(e.g., Kydland and Prescott (1977), Barro and Gordon (1983), Rogoff (1987)). This logic is
often extrapolated to the debate on fixed versus flexible exchange rates. In this context, the
optimal system typically involves a central bank that is left with some ex-post discretion
but that commits to do less smoothing than it would be tempted to do ex-post.18
In this section we show that while this logic is applicable in the horizontal region, it
fails when external crises are of the vertical type. As we discussed in previous sections, in
the vertical region the ex-post incentive for the central bank is to tighten excessively, so
there is neither an inflationary bias nor an ex-post smoothing advantage. In a sense, the
commitment problem is reversed in this case. Partly as a result of institutional design to
prevent the traditional inflationary problem and partly due to the time inconsistency issue
we have described, central banks are likely to behave too conservatively during crises. If so,
the exchange rate/monetary policy combination is unlikely to solve the structural incentive
problem, and the solution may have to be looked for among ex-ante measures.
To analyze these issues, let us introduce two modifications to our basic model. First,
let λ now depend not on the level of peso-interest rates but on the gap between actual and
expected rates. For simplicity, let us also make this function linear and drop the exchange
rate from it:
λ(ip1 − E0ip1) = λ̄ − η(ip1 − E0ip1 ),
λ̄, η > 0
Second, suppose that the central bank objective at date 1 covers both real investment, θk,
as well as meeting its inflation target. For this purpose, let the gap between actual and
target inflation be proportional to the depreciation of the nominal exchange: (e1 − 1), and
let the central bank’s objective be to maximize,
θk − α2 (e1 − 1)2,
with α > 0.
4.1

Horizontal region

At date 1 the central bank takes as given expected interest rates and maximizes:
wn + λ(ip1 − E0ip1)ak − α (e − 1)2
max
1 + i1
2 1
ip1
∗

18

The discussion of fixed with escape clauses, or flexible exchange rate systems with tight inflation targets,

and so on, is largely rooted in this view.

17

This yields as a first order condition (where the superscript H denotes horizontal):
η ak ,
ipH
(10)
1 = i1 −
α 1 + i1
which in the absence of aggregate shocks is equal to the expected interest rate. Thus we
obtain the standard inflation bias of the non-commitment solution:
e1 − 1 = αη 1 ak
+ i1 > 0.
Without aggregate shocks there is no advantage of keeping the option to devalue at
date 1 since the latter is fully anticipated and results on higher inflation but no expansion
of real investment. The role for discretion comes from the presence of aggregate shocks
and the fact that the underlying contracts cannot fully insure these shocks away, so the
expected inflation that enters into the λ expression is the unconditional rather than the
state contingent one.
Let us introduce aggregate shocks, so now there is a good state of the world where the
international interest rate is low enough that all firms can fully finance their investment
needs. The bad state, on the other hand, leads the economy to be in the constrained
horizontal region.
Starting from the good state, it is apparent that since the central bank gains nothing
in terms of real activity from lowering interest rates, it will set e1 = 1 to meet its inflation
target. In the bad state, on the other hand, the problem is exactly as above, and the interest
rate is set as in (10). The important difference with the full certainty (as of date 0) case,
is that the expected interest rate is now lower than ipH
1 , which means that λ > λ̄, and
reinvestment is enhanced by the expansionary ex-post monetary policy.
The latter establishes the standard tradeoff between the stabilization role of discretionary monetary policy and the inflationary bias that such option generates.
∗

∗

∗

4.2

Vertical

These tradeoffs change when the bad state of the world brings about a vertical constraint.
At date 1, regardless of whether this was fully anticipated or not, the central bank sees no
real reward in lowering interest rates as reinvestment no longer depends on λ. Thus it will
be only concerned with its inflation target and set e1 = 1 in all states of the world.
In this case, there is no inflation bias as there is no advantage of ex-post opportunistic
behavior by the central bank. Leaving the central bank with ex-post discretion does not
help smoothing real fluctuations.
18

Quite the contrary, as we described above, the optimal commitment solution is to force
the central bank to be expansionary during the bad state of the world even if that does not
have any ex-post reward. If such commitment exists, then the inflationary bias re-emerges
but in exchange for it date 0 incentives to precaution are improved. That is, rather than
by the ex-post impact of monetary policy, real fluctuations are smoothed by inducing the
private sector to do something about them.
In practice, however, it is highly unlikely that a modern independent central bank –
especially those still affected by the standard reputation issues of and inflation prone past–
will be willing to follow this countercyclical recipe very actively. If so, fear of floating must be
recognized as a positive statement on policy, in which case central bank discretion has little
advantages and the exchange rate discussion becomes more or less moot from a liquidity
provision perspective. The underinsurance problem has to be resolved by ex-ante means
such as the capital taxation of the previous section.
To summarize this section, the standard debate of rules versus discretion, and its application to the exchange rate selection debate, applies to countries that are reasonably well
integrated to international financial markets (w large) and hence have crises that fall into
the horizontal region. It does not apply well to countries that are frequently affected by
sudden stops. Under the modern rules of independent central banking, with concerns for
narrow inflation targets, inflationary bias is not the main concern but fear of floating is.
The latter is problematic because itis exacerbates the structural underinsurance problems
of these economies.
5

Final Remarks

There are three main insights highlighted by our analysis: First, monetary policy during
a sudden-stop crisis has limited real effects since it primarily affects domestic liquidity,
while the main problem is one of international liquidity shortages. The dual of this realineffectiveness is the large sensitivity of the exchange rate to monetary policy. Fear of
floating follows naturally from this asymmetry. Second, private sector decisions in anticipation of a sudden-stop crisis are affected by the expected actions of the monetary authority
during the crisis. In particular, anticipation of increased domestic liquidity during a crisis
will induce the private sector to preserve more international liquidity for the eventual crisis.
Third, since the role of monetary policy in this context is one of incentives rather than one
of (international) liquidity provision, loss of monetary discretion can be substituted for with
ex-ante measures that induce the private sector to save international liquidity for crises.
19

Of course there are many caveats that a stylized model like ours is subject to. For
example, in practice expanding domestic liquidity during crises will have some contemporaneous positive effects. Similarly, we have assumed that once in a crisis, there are no tools to
expand international liquidity. We can relax this assumption and even connect it directly
to monetary policy. The standard argument that a devaluation helps the export sector
when nominal wages are sticky applies here as well if much of the country’s international
collateral is linked to export firms. Conversely, if the prime companies of a country are in
the non-tradeable sector (e.g. energy and telecommunications) and their debt is dollarized,
then a devaluation may reduce international collateral during the crisis.
Equally stylized is our assumption that all crises are either vertical or horizontal. In
many instances crises build up, going first through a horizontal phase, where domestic
financial conditions tighten and external borrowing becomes gradually more expensive, before falling into a sharp vertical sudden stop phase. A central question for policymakers
in this context is what to do with monetary policy at the early stages of the crisis, when
the environment is still fairly horizontal but there is a real concern that a sudden stop
may be around the corner. At this stage, tightening monetary policy destroys financially
constrained projects but saves international liquidity for the potential sudden stop. We conjecture that this tradeoff can be analyzed in terms similar to those we have used throughout:
If the commitment to an aggressive countercyclical monetary policy were the sudden stop
to arrive is credible, then there is little need to tighten during the horizontal phase. But
if the commitment is not credible or feasible, then the appropriate response is to tighten
during the early phase to protect international liquidity, very much as taxing capital flows
at date 0 was advisable in our simplified model in such case. In fact, the costs in terms
of the additional financial distress imposed upon the domestic private sector, is to a large
extent comparable in nature to that of the ex-ante measures we already discussed.
Our goal has been not to provide a policy recommendation but to identify the nature of
the tradeoffs involved and, in particular, to highlight the contrast between these tradeoffs
and those identified in the traditional horizontal view.
Nevertheless, in closing, it is worth speculating on the relevance of our perspective
for the question of what is the optimal exchange rate system for emerging economies. We
conjecture that for this purpose our distinctions are most relevant for an intermediate range
countries. In fact, for countries with a history of inflation problems, the gains of currency
boards probably outweigh the costs.19 Looking at crises as vertical rather than horizontal
does not change the calculation. At the other extreme, for countries with no credibility
19

In addition to those we mention in the text and to the strong credibility anchor it offers, some speculate

20

problems and a precedent of good central banking, floating is probably the best choice, as
long as fear of floating does not become the perceived rule. Quite the opposite, a credible
commitment to a countercyclical monetary policy during crises, is a good substitute for
costly capital controls and ex-ante measures.
The countries that lie in between are those with good central banking, but which —
perhaps for historical reasons — are still concerned with establishing a reputation for containing inflation. Whether in a currency board or not, the evidence is that these countries
fear floating and hence de facto give up ex-post monetary discretion. Our analysis suggests
that these countries ought to look toward ex-ante measures to balance out the incentivebased need for active monetary policy that will not take place. Indeed, for those countries
with very limited financial development, which require overly-active monetary policy in
order to restore adequate incentives, this advice is particularly pertinent. They may be
best served by adopting a currency board and focusing efforts on improving international
liquidity management in the private and public sectors.

that the advantages include a lower interest rates and inflation risk premia due to the enhanced credibility
in controlling inflation, and the potential positive impact that the latter may have on financial deepening.
On the cost side, there is the loss of seignorage.

Detailed programs, definitions and assumptions

There are three main assumptions we have made in the model:

Assumption 1 (Non-observability of Production Shock)

The production shock at date 1 is idiosyncratic. The identity of firms receiving the shock is private
information.

Assumption 2 (Domestic Borrowing Constraint)

A domestic lender can only be sure that a firm will produce λak units of goods at date 2. Any excess
production based on physical reinvestment at date 1 is neither observable nor verifiable.

Assumption 3 (Liquidity Bias)
Foreigners lend to domestic firms only against the backing of w. Domestics lend against both w
and λak.

This gives a date 0 debt constraint with respect to foreigners of d0,f ≤ w. At date 1, if a firm
takes on additional debt with foreigners, the date 1 debt constraint is:
d0,f

+ d1,f ≤ w.

Since domestics lend against λak the debt constraint for domestic lending at date 1 is,

while constraint (iii) reflects that new investment must be fully paid with the resources received by
the firm at date 1 in taking on debts of d1,f and d1,d . Constraint (iv) is purely technological.
An intact firm at date 1 has only one decision: how much finance will it extend to the distressed
firm. Suppose that the firm accepts claims at date 1 of x1,d (face value of date 2 goods) in return

Equilibrium.
Market clearing in the domestic debt market at date 1 (capital letters denote
aggregate quantities) requires that the aggregate amount of domestic debt taken on by distressed
firms is fully funded by intact firms:

Therefore, market clearing,
D1,d

=
=

(11)

determines the domestic dollar-cost of capital, id1 .
An equilibrium of this economy consists of date 0 and date 1 decisions, (k, d0,f ) and (θ, d1,f , d1,d, x1,d),
respectively, and prices id1 . Decisions are solutions to the firms’ problems (P1), (P2), and (P3) given
prices. At these prices, the market clearing condition (11) holds.
Let us now study equilibrium in more detail. Starting from date 1, consider financing and
investment choices of the distressed firm given (k, d0,f ). First, if ∆ − 1 ≥ i∗1 , then the distressed firm
would choose to save as many of its production units as it can. It may borrow up to its international
debt capacity,
d1,f = w − d0,f .
(12)
−d0,f
If the amount raised from international investors, w1+
i∗1 , is less than the funds needed for
restructuring, k, the firm will have to access the domestic debt market to make up the shortfall. It
will choose to do this as long as ∆ − 1 ≥ id1 , or the return on restructuring exceeds the domestic cost
of capital. If the firm borrows fully up to its domestic debt capacity, it will issue debt totalling,

d1,d = λak,

(13)

λak . As long as the sum of λak and the
and raise funds with which to pay for imported goods of 1+
id1
1+id1
right hand side of (12) is more than the borrowing need, the firm is unconstrained in its reinvestment

25

at date 1 and all production units will be saved. In this case, the firm will borrow less than its
domestic debt capacity (and perhaps less than the international debt capacity).
Intact firms can tender at most their excess international debt capacity of w − d0,f in return
for purchasing domestic debt. They will choose to do this as long as the return on domestic loans
exceeds the international rate, id1 ≥ i∗1 .
Assume for a moment that ∆ − 1 ≥ id1 ≥ i∗1 so that distressed firms borrow as much as they can,
−d0,f
and intact firms lend as much as they can. Then, in total the economy can import w1+
i∗1 goods,
which is directed to the distressed firms. A necessary condition for all production units to be saved
is that,
k
w − d0,f
(14)
2 ≤ 1 + i∗ .
1

We shall refer to this constraint as the international liquidity constraint. When neither (13) nor
(14) binds, all production units are saved. Since there is excess supply of funds from intact firms
relative to domestic demand for funds, there is no international liquidity premium, and id1 is equal
to the international interest rate.
The other extreme case is when both (13) and (14) bind. Equilibrium in the domestic debt
market requires that,
λak
1 + id1

= w1−+di0∗,f .
1

Since (13) binds, distressed firms borrow fully up to their debt capacity. As (14) binds, intact firms
purchase this debt with all of their excess funds. Solving for id1 , yields
id1 =

λak
(1 + i∗1) − 1 > i∗1.
w − d0,f

(15)

That is, in this case id1 is above the international interest rate in order to clear the domestic
market for scarce international liquidity. One half times the numerator in (15) corresponds to the
transferable domestic resources owned by distressed firms.
Define the index of domestic illiquidity as the difference between the marginal profit of saving a
distressed production unit and the domestic interest rate of iP1 . When (14) binds, this is,
sd

= ∆ − id1 − 1,

Equilibrium at date 1 can place the economy in one of four regions, classified according to
which of the two (domestic and international) liquidity constraints are binding. The horizontal view
corresponds to the case where the domestic constraint binds, and the international one does not.
The vertical view corresponds to the case where the international constraint binds and the domestic
26

one may or may not. sd > 0 if and only if both constraints bind, and this is the scenario we focused
on in the text. At the aggregate level, the economy is liquidity constrained with respect to foreigners;
at the individual level, firms are liquidity constrained with respect to other domestics since they are
selling all of their domestic liquidity in aggregation; real investment is constrained; domestic spreads
are positive; and the domestic cost of capital of id1 is above the international interest rate.

welfare is increasing in λ in the vertical region.
A.2

Monetary policy and domestic collateral

In this appendix we sketch a model connecting monetary policy to domestic collateral, and thereby
provide one explicit justification for linking λ to monetary policy, as we did in the main text.
The mechanism we illustrate is based on debt-deflation and the resulting transfer from lenders
to borrowers. The lenders will be large, less constrained firms, while the borrowers will be small,
constrained, firms. We do not introduce banks into the model, although in practice these institutions
are surely affected by debt-deflation. In this model, a monetary system that tightens during crises has
the interpretation of corresponding to an environment where there is too little domestic insurance.
The latter is equivalent to a decline in λ in the text.
We begin with the observation that tight monetary policy affects small firms more severely than
large firms. There is a measure S of small firms, and a unit measure of large ones (exactly as
before). Date 0 investment of both types builds aki (for i = s, l - small and large, respectively) units
of domestic collateral. However small firms differ from large ones in two ways. First, they have no
international collateral so that they are reliant on large firms for all investment needs. Second, to
simplify matters, we shall assume that all small firms are distressed at date 1 (this asymmetry with
large firms ensures that in equilibrium there is a reason for small firms to be (partially) insured
against aggregate shocks by large firms).
As before, large firms borrow directly from the rest of the world to setup their plants. Small
firms, on the other hand, finance their date 0 plants by borrowing from large firms, who in turn
borrow from international markets.
28

We introduce a role for monetary policy by assuming that all domestic borrowing at date 0
is done in non-contingent (on aggregate conditions) pesos and is one period.20 Denote b as the
face value of one period domestic debt that each small firm takes at date 0. At date 1 there is an
external shock to the foreign interest rate of i∗1 (ω), where ω ∈ {L, H } is the state of the world. This,
in conjunction with monetary policy, results in a nominal exchange rate of e1(ω) that satisfies the
domestic interest parity condition,
ip1 (ω ) + e1 (ω) − 1 = id1 (ω ).

Thus at date 1 the net worth of a small firm in terms of domestic collateral is,
aks − b/e1 (ω)

Since large firms are at the other side of this transaction, and there is a unit measure of large firms,
the domestic collateral of large firms at date 1 is,
akl + Sb/e1 (ω ).

To save notation, we have substituted the small firm’s debt in the latter expression. Of course,
domestic debt is a private decision of the small and large firms respectively.
Monetary policy is the choice of e1(ω) given the domestic interest parity condition. Note that
if either there is no aggregate uncertainty, or if the debt is fully contingent on e1 , there is no role
for monetary policy in this setup. The rigidity we introduce is one on the debt repayment, resulting
in a debt-deflation channel for monetary policy that transfers resources from large firms (domestic
date 0 lenders) to small firms (domestic date 0 borrowers).21
At date 1, the total investment need of both small and large firms is Sks + 12 kl . The international
liquidity of the country is w − d0,f . We assume that in the H -state, i∗1 is low enough so that these
investment needs are met by each firm. That is,

1 ≤ w − d0,f ,
2 1 + i∗1(H )

Sks + kl

λa ≥ 1 + i∗1 (H ).

and

In the L state, on the other hand, we shall assume the economy is in the “crisis” equilibrium:
θ , θs < 1, with,22

Sθs ks + θl kl

= 1w+−i∗d(0L,f) .

As in much of the debt-deflation monetary policy literature, as well as in much of monetary
economics, we do not address the issue of why the private sector does not write contingent contracts
rather than relying on –or suffering from– the central bank. We are currently working on this
issue and conjecture that adding an extra layer of segmentation, now among domestics, will allow
us to address this deficiency more adequately.
21
See, e.g., Lorenzoni (2000) for a model of debt deflation in the context of an interbank market.
22
S = 0 corresponds to the model we analyzed in the main text. It is always possible to choose a
small S so that parameters lead to the situation we analyze.

Since both large and small firms sell all of their domestic collateral in the market, the analogue of
(3) gives us market clearing of,

= 2Sak +wak− d−0,fSb/e1(L) (1 + i∗1(L)) − 1

(16)

From the last expression we can clearly see that id1 is increasing in the amount of depreciation in the
L state. This dependence is equivalent to our λ function in the main text.
What has happened? As monetary policy tightens (i.e., e1(L) is not allowed to depreciate)
during crises, the amount of effective insurance from large to small firms declines. In contrast, if
policy is loose, e1(L) falls, and resources are transferred from large intact firms to small distressed
firms.23 Since on net these resources loosen the financial constraint on investing firms, in
equilibrium, id1 rises toward the marginal product of ∆ − 1.
In this model the exchange rate is a domestic insurance mechanism. Since date 0 borrowing from
small to large firms is based on the expectations of exchange rate in both H and L states, optimal
policy will call for a strong exchange rate in the H -state, while a depreciated one in the L-state. If
policy is not sufficiently expansionary in the L-state versus the H -state, there is limited domestic
insurance. The latter depresses the effective demand for international collateral and hence, at date
0, it reduces the incentive to precaution against shortages in aggregate international illiquidity.
A.3

The interest parity condition

Throughout the paper we have not been explicit about the mechanism through which the central
bank affects interest rates/exchange rates. For the most part the connection is fairly standard —
indeed many of the papers exploring the accelerator mechanism are not explicit about it either
(e.g. Gertler et al (2001), or Chang et al. (2000)). However, the one deviation is that in our
model, the fact that there is limited collateral in the vertical region does affect id1 and in turn the
exchange rate/domestic interest rate. We draw this association because the price of the nominal
asset (money) is determined by domestics and their demand for money. Since domestics only hold
domestic collateral and money at date 1, the price of money is linked to the price of domestic
collateral. To see this, consider adding an infinitesimal amount of an agent that demands money,
lends against domestic collateral, and has international collateral of w (say a bank). This agent
solves at date 1,

max
{v(m/e1) + m/e2 + xid1
m,x

s.t. x + m/e1

≤ w }.

Resources are also transferred away from large distressed firms, but since these firms have the
same marginal product as the small firms at date 1, this is a zero-sum transfer.
23

30

Where v(·) is demand for real money balances. Normalizing e2 = 1, this gives the F.O.C.,
v (m/e1 ) + e1 = id1 .

Monetary policy is the choice over m, which from this expression results in a unique e1. Setting
ip1 = v (m/e1 ) − 1 gives the parity condition we have used throughout the text.
