    "abstract": "\n\nThe investment theory, in which the expected return varies cross-sectionally with investment, expected profitability, and expected growth, is a good start to understanding Graham and Dodd\u2019s (1934) Security Analysis. Empirically, the q^5 model goes a long way toward explaining prominent equity strategies rooted in security analysis, including Frankel and Lee\u2019s (1998) intrinsic-to-market value, Piotroski\u2019s (2000) fundamental score, Greenblatt\u2019s (2005) \u201cmagic formula,\u201d Asness, Frazzini, and Pedersen\u2019s (2019) quality-minus-junk, Buffett\u2019s Berkshire, Bartram and Grinblatt\u2019s (2018) agnostic analysis, as well as Penman and Zhu\u2019s (2014, 2018) and Lewellen\u2019s (2015) expected-return strategies.\n\n",
