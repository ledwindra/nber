    "abstract": "\n\nWe analyze the development of 49 local bond markets.  Our main finding is that policies and laws matter: Countries with stable inflation rates and strong creditor rights have more developed local bond markets and rely less on foreign-currency-denominated bonds.  The results suggest that \"original sin\" is a misnomer.  Emerging economies are not inherently dependent upon foreign-currency debt.  Rather, by improving policy performance and strengthening institutions they may develop local currency bond markets, reduce their currency mismatch, and lessen the likelihood of future crises.\n\n",
