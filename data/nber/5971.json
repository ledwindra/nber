    "abstract": "\n\nWe re-examine the basic investment problem of deciding when to incur a sunk cost to obtain a stochastically fluctuating benefit.  The optimal investment rule satisfies a trade-off between a larger versus a later net benefit; we show that this trade-off is closely analogous to the standard trade-off for the pricing decision of a firm that faces a downward sloping demand curve.  We reinterpret the optimal investment rule as a markup formula involving an elasticity that has exactly the same form as the formula for a firm's optimal markup of price over marginal cost.  This is illustrated with several examples.\n\n",
