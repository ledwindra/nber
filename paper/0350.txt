ABSTRACT

Measuring the Variance—Age Profile of Lifetime Income

This paper presents an operational meaning to the concept of the
variance in lifetime income in terms of the discounted variance of T

mutually uncorrelated, sequentially realized, random variables. It
is then shown how the logical implications of the lifecycle consumption

model can be used to estimate this series of variances, called the
variance—age profile of lifetime income, and we refer to an earlier
paper by Eden (1977) to show how this variance-age profile can be
used to compare the riskiness of alternative labor income paths.

Finally the estimation technique is applied to Israeli data in order
to compare the riskiness of the earnings path of those who attended
college with that of those who terminated their education at the

high school level in that economy, and to consider data requirements and estimation problems in greater depth.

A. Introduction
This paper is concerned with providing measures of the total
and the time profile of the realizations in the variance in lifetime income.

Some preliminary definitions will clarify these terms. Let W =

[w1,w2,

•.., WT]

where T is the length of the planning horizon, designate the individual's
random labor income path and note that the accumulation of information will

cause the distribution of W to change over time. Now if r is the safe interest
rate, and A is the known value of the individual's assets at t, then we define
T

=
the distribution of
C—)

t

available at t, to be the distribution of lifetime income in period t. The
variance in Y°(Var(Y°)) is termed the total variance in lifetime income, while

Var(Y)— Var(Yt+l) for t=0, 1,... T—l, is that portion of Var(Y0) which
is-realized in period t. Since Var(Y ) =

(l+r)
a by construction (see
j=0

appendix) we only consider estimates of the vector a =
02 ...,

[01,

a2 will be called the variance—age profile of lifetime income. If its elements
are large there is a high degree of uncertainty in the associated income stream,

while if a2 =

[a,

0, 0, ...,

0]

all of this uncertainty is resolved by the end

of the first period.

Our interest in 2 stems from the life—cycle permanent—income theory
of individual decision—making. An important empirical implication of that
model is that individual decisions which affect their income paths can be
1

analyzed solely in terms of the effect of those decisions on Y = [Y

,

T1

1 That is one need not consider alternate joint distributions of the entire
sequence of random wage vectors generated by alternative information sets.

—2—

Our purpose is to present a method for estimating a set of second order
moments of this distribution which are particularly relevant to the decision

maker. That is, since information is useful in the sense that it allows one
to plan more accurately, it can be shown that, caeterus parabus, income paths

with lower Var(Y°) and more of the variance in lifetime income realized in

earlier periods, will be preferred over alternatives.2 Estimates of
ought, therefore, to be helpful in analyzing an assortment of decisions -

including

those on schooling, on-the-job training, migration, changing sectors

of employment, and joining a union.

In addition, the procedure for estimating a2 presented here leads
naturally to a definition of, and an estimator for, the best predictor of
future consumption given present information. In this context, this paper
extends the work of Hall (1979), on predicting aggregate consumption, to
micro data and provides an explicit means of estimating the error variance
in this prediction.

The theoretical rational behind the estimation procedure is discussed

in the next section. Section C adds the appropriate disturbances and describes
the identification scheme. The model is then applied to estimating and
comparing the variance-age profiles of individuals who went to college and
those who terminated their education after high school in the Israel economy.
In the empirical section attention is given to an assortment of estimation

problems. Finally, a short summary is provided.

It should be noted that these preferences do not depend on any cardinal
properties of the intertemporal choice function, such as its concavity. In
fact, Eden (77) has shown that provided there exists a market which offers
fair bets whose outcome is known in the near future, such as portfolios or
stocks with an average rate of return greater than or equal to r, estimates
of a2 will suffice to provide a partial ordering of income streams with the
same initial expected value. Strictly speaking our use of Eden's criteria
requires either that y be distributed joint normally, or that the choice
function be additive in a quadratic instantaneous utility function.

B. Using the Life-Cycle Model to Measure a2.
In the life-cycle consumption model each individual at every t plans
a random consumption vector for the remainder of the planning horizon by
maximizing an intertemporal objective function subject to the random lifetime

(b)

The appendix proves that, for every income path, there exists an n whose

elements are mutually uncorrelated, and that the expected value of n1 given the
information in any previous period is zero, for i = 1, 2,

T. It follows

that the variance-covariance matrix of n is diagonal with the principle diagonal

elements being a2 the variance-age profile of lifetime income.
We assume that the distribution of the consumption paths chosen under n
will be the same as those chosen under the random income path which defines it.
Since, by construction, the first two moments of the lifetime budget constraint
are the same under both vectors for all t, a sufficient condition for this

-4-

assumption is that the distribution of Y be entirely determined by these moments

Let C÷1 be the consumption planned for period t+l in period t if

the realization of

is reasonable to assume that:

This is not a necessary condition since the intertemporal objective function
may be such that all consumption programs are determined by the first two
moments of Y regardless of the latter's distribution. See Levhari and
Srinvanson (1969) for a discussion of this point.
See Levhari and Srinvanson (1969) for the intertemporal objective function

where U( )

is

strictly-concave one-period utility function, cS is the rate of

subjective time preference, and it is understood that the expectation is taken

conditional on all information available at t. It can be shown (see Hall, 1979)
that the optimum consumption program in this case will satisfy the first order
condition:

=

U'(C)

(6)

As noted by Hall (1979), equation (5) implies that consumption in period
t + 1 should be predicted by C alone.5 We approximate (5) by

This approximation is good if U' is close to linear. In this case
x =

and a =

A reasonable prior seems to be a = 0 and A = 1.

We shall use this prior later.

Note that the additive welfare function is required for this result.

C. Disturbance Terms and The Identification Scheme6
Following Friedman (1957) and others, it is assumed that measured

consumption, c, is related to the latent consumption variable which appears

in the model, C, by

CC +E
where

(8)

is a zero mean disturbance term which is assumed to be uncorrelated

with C and to have a constant variance over two—year intervals. It arises as
a result of mismeasurement and differences in preferences. Substituting (7) and
(2) into (8) we obtain,

c+1 = a

+

Xc

t+l

+

÷l

(9)

Comparing (9) to (2) one finds that allowing for disturbance terms has the
implication that the difference between observed consumption in period t+l, and
the consumption expected in period t+l given the information in period t,

a +

Xct

is not a perfect indicator of t+l

of a non-zero realization of

t+l

- Ac .
t

In

since it may also be a result
addition, the disturbance term is,

by construction, correlated with c. Therefore, an ordinary least squares
regression on (8) will provide inconsistent estimates of a and A.

6

Econometrically the model to be presented here belongs to a class of latent
variable models discussed in detail by Joreskog (1973). Our presentation of
the maximum likelihood estimates for the model, is similar to that of
Chamberlin (1976).

—7—

The latter problem can be solved by assuming:

Since assumption (l0a) has been discussed extensively by other researchers, it will
not be discussed here.7 (lOb) and (lOc) are reasonable since

is uncorrelated

with any information available at t, including wt; and c is a function of w.

Given (10), consistent estimates of the parameters in (9) can be derived by using

w as an instrument on c.
To separate the two sources of the difference between c÷1 and a +

we use the property that c is correlated

namely t+l - Xct) and
with t÷l -

Since 0'() converges to zero with sample

if N is large.

See, for example, Liviatan (1961) and (1963). Liviatan's (1961) analysis of
the demand for individual products uses ct+l as an indicator of permanent
income in period t + 1, an idea similar to the one used here.

Thus, a complete identification of the model requires information about the

D. An Example: Estimates of a2 For Different Schooling Groups
In order to illustrate the use of our technique and to consider relevant
estimation problems, we estimated and compared the a2 vectors associated with
the earnings paths of high school and university graduates in the Israel

-9-

economy. The data was gathered by Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics and
covers families (both spouses present) who were interviewed as to their

consumption decisions in 1963/64 and then again in 1964/65. In each case
the husband was between the ages of 21 and 65 and had at least five years

of schooling.8 w and c were defined to equal the wage income of the male
head of the household from his primary labor activity and the consuniption

expenditures of the household, respectively.

In any particular year the ex-ante expectations of the distribution of
may not equal the ex-post distribution of its realizations, since as
a result of a macro (Or a year) effect we may sample only a portion of the

distribution of n,1. When the GNP is below its expected average, consumers
will tend to experience negative realizations of
choosing lower (than average) levels of

and will adjust by

If we limit the sample to one

time period, we will, in this case, obtain a downward bias in both the

estimate of C1 and of a1. Similarly, when the labor market for the
group we are interested in is unexpectedly buoyant, we will overestimate
and again underestimate

An econometric solution to this problem

requires data over many years. Our data, however, consists of observations
over two years only. In the absence of appropriate data, one may either
use the prior a = 0 and A = 1, or examine whether it is reasonable to assume

that the particular year chosen was typical and ignore the year effect. Both
possibilities will be explored here.

8

These data are described more fully by the Central Bureau of Statistics
(1967). We are grateful to Reuben Gronau for allowing us to use his
key for this data set.

-10-

Since the variance-age profile of lifetime wealth is a new concept we
start by presenting measures of it for an average member of the sample.
Table 1 presents the instrumental variable estimates of equation (8) for two

subsamples; those below and those at or above, age 45. The

deviate tests

the joint hypothesis that a = 0 andX= 1. Neither of the X statistics are

surprising. Their sum equals 3.10 which is less than the expected value of

a X deviate under the null hypothesis. Thus, it seems that the year effect
is not significant in our sample. We shall proceed by imposing a =

0,

A = 1.

As one might expect, the results for the case of free parameters were similar.
Table 2 presents the estimated variance components and some relevant

moments. Note that the variance in wages,

=

1/2 Var(w) + 1/2 Var(w+1),

is always greater than the variance in consumption,
+

=

1/2 Var(c)

1/2 Var(ct+i). This is consistent with the life-cycle hypothesis. Further,

note that a2 is about fifty percent larger in the older age group. This does
not imply, however, that more uncertainty is resolved at older ages, since,
over time, information is accumulated with respect to positions in the

cross-section distribution of earnings. The variance of c÷1 —

ct

also

increases with age but this increase is much less than the increase in a2.

To obtain the variance of

Var(c+i -

c)

must be purged of observed

consumption changes caused by mismeasurement. Column (4) in Table 2 presents

The main conclusion from these tables is that more information on
lifetime income is accumulated per unit of time early on in the life-cycle.

The standard errors of the estimated variance components indicate, however,

that this conclusion cannot be held too firmly.9 The major cause of the

the magnitude of a(l -

10

A data base with a more precise measure of consumption services would do
better on this count, but, failing that, one could add indicators of mismeasurement (e.g. large one-time expenditures for durable goods) or of transitory changes in consumption (e.g. changes in the number of persons in the

household) to equation (8) and reestimate the model.1' For example, had we
been able to decrease the variance of the disturbance in equation (8) to equal

that of n, and if all other parameters remained unchanged, the standard
error of

would have fallen from IL 12,124 to IL 2,374 in the older age

group, and from IL 6,832 to IL 2,431 in the younger. Note also that the
variance of

22.
a is

of the order 1/N so that if, under these same assumptions,

the size of the sample were increased to 5,000, the standard errors would have
decreased further to IL 716 and IL 613 respectively.
Next we compare the variance-age profile of lifetime income experienced
by those who went to college with that for individuals who only attended

high school. Each educational group was split into an older and a younger

In the limit the estimated variance components are normally distributed
about their true values with the standard errors reported in Table 2.
10

The variance of 2a2 is an increasing, convex function of a2(l -

p).

11

The addition of variables to equation (13) would necessarily decrease the
variance of the estimate of 2a but would have a cost in terms of an
increase in the variance of X. Since, in our case, the regression coefficients are not of primary importance, the tradeoff seems worthwhile.

age group12 and equation (8) was estimated usingw as an instrument on c
for each of the age-schooling groups separately. None of the

values were

signficant, nor was their sum, so that we can accept the hypothesis that
c*=0, X = 1 for each group and for the sample as a whole. Table 4 presents

the relevant moments together with sample size for each group. All of the
general comments made above apply to these numbers as well; in particular,
is always less than a, (72(1 - p) increases with age in both educational

groups and is always large, causing imprecise estimates of 822 comparing
the point estimates of 8 a across groups, we find that among those who did
not go to college more of the variance of lifetime income is realized per
unit of time in the earlier part of the life-cycle, while among those who

did go to college the opposite is true. That is, the college-educated have to
wait relatively longer to acquire information on their lifetime income.

Therefore, even if the total variance in lifetime income were the same for
both groups, the variance-age profile of those who did not attend college
would be preferred to the profile for those.who did.

In fact, however, the

variance-age profile of the college-educated lies entirely above that of those
who did not go to college, indicating that college education leads to a more

risky earnings path in the sense made explicit in Eden (77). Again, the
standard errors of our estimates are large and as a result any conclusions

from them should be considered as preliminary.13
12

In fact there were only about S units in the 20-25 and 60-65 age groups in
each educational class and they contributed a great deal of a(l - p), so
the younger group in Table 4 was redefined to equal ages 25-44 and the older group to be ages 45-59.

13 Three caveats are worthy of note. First, in this early version of our analysis, we have ignored problems induced by self-selection. That is individuals
who go to (do not go to) college may expect to experience more desirable
variance-age profiles as a result of going to (not going to) college than
a random member of the population would. In addition, there is the question
of the stability of these profiles. To make inferences about individual
decision-making from the information contained in a single corss section
one must assume that an individual who attends college at the age of (cont.)

Conclusion and Summary
This paper has presented an operational meaning to the concept of the
variance in lifetime income in terms of the discounted sum of the variance in

T mutually uncorrelated, sequentially realized, random variables. The logical
implicatons of the lifecycle consumption model can be used to estimate this

variance age-profile and Eden (77) has shown how these estimates can be used
to compare the riskiness of alternative income streams.

The estimation technique was applied to Israeli data in order to
compare the riskiness of the earnings path of those who attended college with

that of those who terminated their education at the high school level. The
estimates of

derived for these two groups are preliminary, both because of

their large standard errors and because, at this early stage of analysis, we

ignored the influence of such phenomenon as sample selection. The results indicate that the total variance in lifetime income is smaller for high-school
graduates and that, in contrast to the college educated, most of the uncertainty
in the income streams of high school graduates is resolved in younger ages.
Thus, the earnings path experienced by college graduates seems to be more

risky. Moreover, the example has shown how richer data could overcome both the
selection and the precision problems associated with estimating the vector a2
in a variety of circumstances.

twenty expects to experience at the age of thirty the same variance which
is experienced now by a person who matriculated ten years ago. Third the
a2 vectors estimated here are averages over individual a2 vectors in a
particular group and the actual a2 vectors may have some within-group
variance. We add, however, that none of these problems are new and they
also appear in the more traditional estimates of the first order moments
of labor income streams.
