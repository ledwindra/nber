The Decline of Unionization in the United States:
What Can Be Learned From Recent Experience?

ABSTRACT

The dramatic decline in unionization over the last decade is
investigated in the context of a supply/demand model of union status
determination. Data from surveys conducted in 1977 and 1984 are used to
decompose the decline into components due to a drop in the demand for union
repre3entation and a drop in the supply of union jobs relative to demand. It
is found that there has been a substantial drop in demand that can be
accounted for by an increase in the job satisfaction of nonunion workers and a
decrease in nonunion workers' beliefs that unions improve wages and working
conditions. It is also found that there has been a substantial drop in the
supply of union jobs relative to demand that is attributed to an increase in
employer resistance to unionization. Increased foreign and increased nonunion
domestic competition (particularly in deregulated industries) are cited as the
likely key underlying causes of these changes.

Introduction

The last fifteen years have seen a precipitous decline in the extent of

unionization in the United States. Based on data from the Nay Current
Population Surveys summarized in table 1, the fraction of private
nonagricultural employment made up of union members has fallen from 25.6

percent in 1973 to 14.1% in 1985. The reasons for this decline are not clear.

One potential explanation is that the decline is due to increased employer
hostility toward unions and union organizing activity (Freeman and Medoff,

1984; Freeman, 1985). Another potential explanation is that increased
competitiveness of American markets, partly due to the past behavior of the
unions themselves, has resulted in unions having less to offer workers today

than they did in the past. A third potential explanation is that shifts in
the demographic, industrial, and occupational composition of the labor force
away from traditionally heavily unionized types of workers and sectors can
account for at least part of the decline in unionization (Farber, 1985;
Dickens and Leonard, 1985).
Of course, these positions are neither independent nor mutually

exclusive. For example, it may be that the increased competitiveness of the
domestic and world economy makes it difficult for unionized firms to compete
if their labor costs are higher than their foreign or nonunion domestic

competition. This has the implications that employers will resist

2

unionization more strenuously and that potentially unionizable workers will

feel that unions cannot offer the advantage of higher levels of compensation

without an unacceptable risk to employment. In addition, these same forces
may have caused part of the shift in employment away from traditionally
heavily unionized blue—collar manufacturing jobs.
In this study a model of the determination of the union status of

workers, based on the work of Farber (1983), is used to decompose the decline
in unionization into separate components due to a decline in demand and a

decline in supply relative to demand. While the usual data on the union
status of workers is not sufficient to identify shifts in demand and supply
separately, data from the 1977 Quality of Employment Survey (QES) and a survey
done by Louis Harris and Associates for the AFL-CIO in 1984 contain

information that can be used for this decomposition. These data provide the
focus of the empirical analysis.

The central findings are that the decline in unionization since 1977 is
accounted for by 1) increased employer resistance to unionization (probably
due to increased product market competitiveness) resulting in a decrease in
the supply of union jobs relative to demand and 2) decreased demand for

unionization by nonunion workers due to an increase in the satisfaction of
nonunion workers with their jobs and a decline in nonunion workers' beliefs

that unions are able to improve wages and working conditions. The evidence
further suggests that shifts in the demographic, industrial, and occupational
composition of employment can explain little of the decline in unionization
between 1977 and 1984.

Model of the

II. A

Extent

of Unionization

The simplest empirical model of the union status of workers is a
univariate discrete choice model. In

only

if some latent variable, Y4. ,

is

this model

a worker is unionized (U. =1)
1

positive. The interpretation generally

3

given to this latent variable (for example, Lee, 1978) is that it represents
the difference between worker i's utility on a union job and his/her utility

on a nonunion job. Given that
Y

(11.1)

Ii

= X. /3

where X. is a vector of worker characteristics, 3 is a vector of parameters,
and

is a random component, the probability of a worker being unionized is
(11.2)

has a standard normal distribution then this is the usual probit model

so that Pr(U.=1) =

+(X131)

where (') is the standard normal cumulative

distribution function.

A key assumption underlying this model is that all workers who desire

union representation are actually working on a union job. However, there are
good reasons to believe that there is, in fact, excess demand for vacancies

in existing union jobs (Abowd and Farber, 1982; Farber, 1983). This implies
that not all nonunion workers who would prefer their job to be unionized by
the criterion outlined above (Y >0) are willing or able either to find a
Ii

union job or to organize their current job. To the extent that this is true,
?r(U.=1)
1

the

Ii

Pr(Y >0). There will be some nonunion workers for whom Y

11 >0, and

univariate probit model of union status summarized in equations 11.1 and

11.2 loses its structural interpretation. However, it is still useful as a
summary of the data.

It is reasonable to ask why all workers who would prefer their job to

be unionized do not organize their job or find a union job. Some nonunion
workers might not be willing to take a different job simply because it is

4

unionized because to do so would entail the sacrifice of seniority rights and

other valuable aspects of their current job.' Second, some workers may prefer
their current job to be unionized, but they may not be willing to undertake

the costs of organization and petitioning for an election. These costs are
bound to exceed the costs of simply supporting an already existing
organization through the payment of dues where others have borne the cost of

organization. Even if some workers might be willing to invest time and effort
in a union organizing drive, such an effort might not be successful so that

the job would remain nonunion. Finally, some workers who may be willing to
quit their current job to take a union job might not be offered a job by a
unionized employer.

The implication of this discussion is that there are likely to be queues
for vacancies in existing union jobs in the sense that there will be nonunion
workers who would like the benefits of a union job but who would not be

willing to undertake organization themselves. In this context the demand for
union representation is composed of two distinct groups of workers. The first
group consists of those workers who demand union representation and were hired

by a union employer. This group is easy to identify. They are simply the
workers who report themselves to be unionized. The second group consists of
workers who demand union representation but are unable or unwilling either to

find a union job or to organize their current job. This group is more
difficult to identify since they are a subset of the workers who report
themselves as not union members.

The key to the analysis in this study is that data are available in 1977
and 1984 that can be used to split the group of nonunion workers into a group

that prefers union representation and a group that does not. Essentially,

1See Abraham and Nedoff (1984, 1985) for evidence on the importance of
seniority in nonunion workplaces.

5

nonunion workers were asked if they would prefer their job to be unionized,

and the response to this question (No=O, Yes=1) is interpreted as an indicator
of whether the worker feels that he/she would be better off if the job were

unionized (Y1)O). It is argued that the workers who are in the queue for
union jobs are identified by their response to this question (called VFU here)
and that this measures the demand for union representation among nonunion

workers. A worker is classified as demanding union representation (D1) if
he/she is unionized (13=1) or he/she is not unionized and responds

affirmatively to the union preference question (VFU=1).
In the light of these considerations, a useful tool for the analysis of

the decline of unionization is an economic model based on movements in the

suppiy of and demand for union representation. A stylized version of such a
model has two components. First, the demand for union representation is based
on the model of rational choice, outlined above for the simple univariate

model of union status determination. Second, the supply of union jobs is
based on the amount of organization undertaken by unions and the success of

these efforts as they affect the number of union jobs available. The quantity
of unionization is determined by the minimum of demand and supply.
Note that these notions of supply and demand are interdependent.

Employer behavior in response to the threat of unionization will affect both
the net benefits of unionization to workers (demand) and the expected net

benefits of unionization to unions (supply). Employer responses can range
from higher wages and "union—like" personnel policies on the one hand to
outright resistance to union organizing efforts and implicit discrimination

against union supporters on the other. Nevertheless, the distinction will
prove useful.

The demand for union representation by an individual worker is a
discrete choice problem where the worker compares his/her utility on union and

nonunion jobs and selects the job with the higher utility. This utility

6

difference is defined above (equation 11.1) as Y1.. Thus, worker i will
prefer union representation (D=l) only if Y1. is positive, and worker i does
not prefer union representation (D.=0) otherwise. On this basis, the
probability that worker i prefers union representation is
(11.3)

This

Pr(D.1 =1) =

Pr(Y Ii >0)

=

ii

Pr( Ii >—X. /3 ).

is the fundamental relationship for the demand for union representation.

Given data on D. for all workers and assuming a standard normal distribution
for

•

, the

parameter vector /3 can be estimated using standard univariate

probit maximum likelihood techniques.

The notion of the supply of union jobs relative to demand is based
fundamentally on ability of workers who demand union representation to find a

union job. This will depend not only on the characteristics of the particular
worker but also on employer behavior with regard to unions and organizing as

it affects the total number of union jobs available. For example, more active
employer resistance to unionization will undoubtedly result in the existence
of fewer union jobs, and this will reduce the ability of workers who demand
union representation by the criterion outlined above to find a union job.

More formally, suppose that a worker who demands union representation
is able to find a union job (S1=1) only if some index

is positive and is

not able to get a union job (S.=0) otherwise. Let
(11.4)

where 82 is a vector of parameters, and

is a random component. Thus, the

probability that worker i who prefers union representation is able to find a
union job is
(11.5)

= Pr(Y >0) = Pr(E

>-X. /3 ).

Given data on U for all workers who demand union representation and assuming

7

a standard normal distribution for e !D=1, the parameter vector

can be

estimated using standard univariate probit maximum likelihood techniques.2
This conditional probability is fundamentally related to the supply of union
jobs, and it neatly accounts for much of the confusion of factors that affect
demand and supply because it is a measure of the supply of union jobs relative
to demand.

Based on these relationships, a worker i will be unionized (U.=l) only

if he/she both prefers a union job and is able to find one (Y1. andY,. are

positive). The probability of this event is
(11.6)

Pr(U.=1)=Pr(D=1)Pr(S.=1ID.=1)
1

=

Pr(YIi.>0)Pr(Y2x>0).

It is clear that with data only on union status it is not possible to estimate
the determinants of demand (Y1.) and supply (Y,.) separately with any

robustness. However with data on the demand and supply, such estimation is
possible.3

III. The Data and Sampling Issues
Data from two surveys that contain information on nonunion worker demand
for union representation independent of union status are used in the analysis.

2Farber (1983, 1984) develops and estimates a multivariate probit model where

estimates of /3 using both the univariate probit model and the multivariate

probit model based on the 1977 QES data, and they are virtually identical. On
this basis, the analysis proceeds using the more straightforward univariate
and e

probit model. This is equivalent to assuming that
independently distributed.

31n fact, it is possible to derive estimates of the determinants of demand and
supply separately with data only on union status, but identification will
depend crucially on the functional forms chosen for the distributions of
and

The first survey (QES) is the Quality of Employment Survey (QES), which was
carried out by the Survey Research Center at the University of Nichigan in

1977 (Quinn and Staines, 1979). The second survey (AFL) was carried out by
Lewis Harris and Associates Inc. for the American Federation of Labor —

Congress of Industrial Organizations in 1984 (Lewis Harris and Associates,
1984).

The QES was designed to be a representative sample of American workers.
However, the AFI survey is not representative of the workforce in that, since
its goal was to learn about the attitudes of nonunion workers toward unions in
order to aid organizing efforts, unionized workers were "quota sampled".

Workers were contacted randomly by Harris, and all nonunion workers who met
certain criteria (age over eighteen, employed, not self—employed) were

administered the survey. Union workers who were contacted and who met the
criteria were administered the survey until a quota of 250 was reached. Any
union workers contacted after this point were counted but not administered the

survey. Given the central role that union membership plays as an endogenous
variable in the analysis, this creates a classic choice—based sampling problem

(Manski and Lerman, 1977; Manski and McFadden, 1981). This is accounted for

in the analysis that follows in two ways. Where frequencies are analyzed, the
counts are weighted appropriately. Where probit models involving the
probability of union membership are estimated, a straightforward modification
(to accommodate the discrete choice nature of the problem) of the maximum
likelihood choice—based sampling procedure suggested by Hausman and Wise
(1981) is used.

Samples of workers were derived from the two surveys in an identical

fashion. These samples consist of all non—managerial workers who were not
self—employed and for whom complete information was available on the workers'
demographic characteristics, industry, occupation, union status, preference
for union representation, attitudes about the general usefulness of unions,

9

and job satisfaction. The QES sample has 920 observations while the AFL
sample has 1082 observations. Table 2 contains sample proportions (both
overall and for 1977 and 1984 separately) for the labor force structure
measures that are used in the analysis.

In order to account for the undersampling of union workers in the AFL

survey, the degree of undersampling needs to be estimated. Actually, this is
quite simple because Harris kept track of the number of union workers who were

"quota'd out". After administering the survey to the 250 union workers, an
additional 28 union workers were contacted but not surveyed. Assuming (as is
reasonable) that the sample selection criteria outlined above have the same
proportional impact on those actually surveyed and those who were quota'd out,
the probability of observing a randomly selected union worker who meets the

sample selection criteria in the final sample is simply .899=250/278. On this
basis a value of .9 is used for this probability, and counts of union workers
from the AFL sample are weighted by 1.11=11.9.

The key information contained in both the QES and and the AFL survey is
the response of nonunion workers to a question (VFU) asking whether they would
vote for union representation on their current job if a secret ballot election

were held. The response to this question (No=O, Yes=1) is interpreted as an
indication of the worker's demand for union representation. An affirmative
response (VFU=1) suggests that the worker feels he/she would be better off if

the job were unionized (Y1.0). Similarly, a negative response suggests that
the worker feels he/she would be better off if the job were not unionized
(Y1-i.<0).

Neither

survey asks the analogous question of unionized workers.

However, since nonunion jobs are relatively freely available, it is assumed
that all unionized workers are unionized because they prefer their jobs to be
unionized and that they would answer the VFU question affirmatively (Y. >0).
This is clearly not completely accurate, and there are likely to be some

I

unionized workers who would prefer their job not to be unionized. However,
there is relevant evidence from the National Longitudinal Surveys of Young Men
and Young Women which asks the VFU question of unionized workers in 1980 and

1982 respectively. In samples constructed similarly to those used in this
study, only about 11%

of

unionized workers reported that they prefer their job

not to be unionized.4
Simple tabulation of the data confirm the dramatic decline in

unionization between 1977 and 1984. Fully 32.9% of the workers in the 1977
QES reported that they were union members while only 20.1% (21.8% weighted) of

the 1984 AFL survey reported that they were union members. Tabulation of the
data also verifies that the demand for union representation and the supply of

union jobs relative to demand fell between 1977 and 198g. The demand for
union representation among nonunion workers, Pr(D=1IU=0), is the fraction of

the nonunion sample that responded affirmatively to the VFU question. This
fell from 39.5% in 1977 to 32.4% in 1984. The overall demand for union
representation, Pr(D=1), is the sum of the fraction of the sample that is
unionized and the fraction of the sample that is nonunion and responded

affirmatively to the VFU question. On this basis, the demand for union
representation fell from 59.5% in 1977 to 47.1% (weighted) in 1984. Finally,
the supply of union jobs relative to demand is measured by the fraction

unionized of the workers who demand union representation. This is
Pr(tJ=1ID=1), and it fell from 55.4% in 1977 to 46.3% (weighted) in 1984.

These frequencies are summarized in table 3, and the sample proportions of the
labor force structure measures for the workers who demand union representation
are contained in the last column of table 2.

4mese data are not analyzed in detail here because they sample only a limited
age range of workers (late twenties to late thirties).

With this information, the decline in union membership from 32.9% in
1977 to 21.8% in 1984 can be broken out into components due to the drop in
demand from 59.5% to 47.1% and the drop in supply relative to demand from

55.4% to 46.3%. Taking the differential of equation (11.6) yields

The first term represents the effect of a change in demand, the second term
represents the effect of a change in supply, and the last term is a second

order term that can be safely ignored here. Based on the numbers derived
above and using the average of the 1977 and 1984 levels, of the 11.1
percentage point drop in unionization, 6.3 points are due to a decline in
demand and 4.8 points are due to a decline in supply relative to demand.
Thus, both factors have been very important.

This analysis, which is essentially a comparison of means, relies
heavily on the comparability of the QES and the AFL1 sampling designs. It is
clear from table 2 that there are some differences in the means of the labor
force structure measures between the two samples that are not likely to be the
result of changes in labor force structure over the seven year period between

the surveys. The next step is to estimate multivariate discrete choice models
that can account for observable differences in the relevant probabilities.
This will also shed light on the extent to which the declines in these various
measures can be accounted for by the standard explanations of shifts in the
demographic, occupational, and

industrial

composition of the labor force.

12

Before turning to estimation of the discrete choice models specified in

section II, it is necessary to specify a probit estimator that can account for
the choice—based nature of the AFI1 data.

IV. The Choice-Based Sample Probit 1odel
Following Hausman and Wise (1981), consider a random variable y

with

density function f(y). Assume that y is sampled with probability p1 if y is
less than zero and that y is sampled with probability p7 if y is greater than

or equal to zero. In this case the distribution of y in the resulting sample
is

Note that is is essentially a variable weighting procedure.
Consider first estimating the simple probit model of union status

outlined in equations 11.1 and 11.2. Workers are undersampled if they are
both unionized and from the AFL sample. In this context, P1=1 for all
observations, and, based on the evidence presented earlier in this section,
(Iv.3)

observation i, where AFL. is a dummy variable that equals 1 if the

observation is from the AFL sample and equals 0 if the observation is from the

QES sample. The choice—based density function in equations IV.1 and IV.2
reduce to f(y) for the QES sample because both P1 and P2 equal one for these
observations.

Given the standard normal distribution of the errors and the choice
based nature of the sample, the probability that a worker is unionized is

and the log—likelihood function can be formed in a straightforward manner from
these probabilities.

The model of demand for union representation is specified in a similar

fashion. However, only the union workers from the AFL sample are
undersampled. The nonunion workers from the AFL sample and all workers from
the QES sample are appropriately represented. In this case,

where D=1 if the worker either is unionized or is nonunion and responds
affirmatively to the VFU question and D.=O if the worker is nonunion and

responds negatively to the VFU question. Pr(D.=O) is simply 1-Pr(D.=1), and
the log—likelihood function is derived straightforwardly.

The model of demand for union representation among nonunion workers is

the same model as for the demand for union representation overall. However,
there are obviously no union workers so there is no choice—based sampling
problem and the probability in equation (IV.7) reduces to a simple probit
specification.

The model of the supply of union jobs relative to demand is specified
identically to the model of the probability of unionization except that it is

14

estimated only over the subsample of workers who demand a union job (D=1).

probabilities in a straightforward fashion.

V. The Decline in the Fraction Unionized
Before investigating the demand for and relative supply of union jobs,

it is worth investigating the change in the fraction unionized between 1977

and 1984. Table 4 contains estimates of the choice—based sample probit model
of the probability that a worker is unionized discussed in section IV. This
model does not have a structural interpretation, but it is useful as a summary

of the data. The model in the first column includes only a constant and the

AFL dummy variable. The estimated coefficient on the AFL dummy is
significantly less than zero, suggesting that that probability of unionization

was lower in 1984. The model in the second column includes an additional
nineteen dummy variables (defined in table 2) that control for various
dimensions of labor force structure (sex, race, age, region, industry, and

occupation). These labor force structure variables clearly are significantly
related to the probability of unionization based on a likelihood ratio test.5

The coefficient of the MI dummy variable in the model that includes the labor
force structure variables is still significantly negative and of approximately
the same magnitude as in the basic model.

5The likelihood ratio test statistic is 302.8 (p—value < .0001) which is
distributed as x with 19 degrees of freedom.

While the results are not presented here, the model was reestimated

allowing labor force structure to have different effects on the probability of

unionization in the two years. A separate probit model was estimated for each
year (choice—based for 1984). On the basis of these results, it is not
possible to reject the hypothesis that the parameters of the labor force

structure variables are the same in 1977 and 1984 against the model with a
single set of labor force structure variables plus an intercept shift for
1984.6

Given the nonlinearity of the probit model, the negative estimated
coefficient for the AFIJ variable does not imply an invariant relationship with

the probability of unionization. In order to interpret the results correctly,
the lower half of table 4 contains mean predicted probabilities of

unionization for the entire sample under two assumptions. First it is assumed
that it is 1977 for all workers (AFI. = 0 V i). This mean probabilIty is
computed as

reported as well. The reported asymptotic standard errors are computed as
first order approximations to the nonlinear function of random variables.
The estimates in the first column of table 4 confirm a statistically

significant 11.4 percentage point drop in the mean probability of unionization

between 1977 and 1984. The key finding is that, even after controlling for
labor force structure, the mean probability of unionization is fully 10.2
percentage points lower in 1984 than in 1977.

The conclusions are 1) that the raw difference between 1977 and 1984 in
the probability of unionization is not an artifact of different sample designs
and 2) that changes in labor force structure can account for very little of

the overall decline in unionization over the past decade. This contrasts with
evidence from the 1950—1980 period (Farber, 1985; Dickens and Leonard, 1985)

which suggests that as much as half of the decline in unionization over that

period can be accounted for by structural shifts in the labor force. The
explanation for the recent decline must lie elsewhere.

VI. The Decline in Demand for Unionization
Table 5 contains estimates of the choice-based probit model of the

probability that a worker demands union representation. This analysis is
identical to the analysis of the probability of union membership in the
previous section except that the dependent dichotomous -variable equals one not

only for union members but also for nonunion workers who would vote for union
representation.

The model in the first column of table 5 includes only a constant and

the AFL dummy variable. The estimated coefficient on the AFL dummy is
significantly less than zero, reflecting the fact that the demand for union

representation was lower in 1984 than in 1977. The model in the second column
includes the nineteen labor force structure dummy variables. Based on a
likelihood ratio test, these labor force structure variables clearly are

While the results are not presented here, the model was reestimated
allowing labor force structure to have different effects in the two years on

the probability of that a worker demands union representation. A separate
probit model was estimated for each year (choice—based for 1984). The
hypothesis that the parameters of the labor force structure variables are the
same in 1977 and 1984 can be rejected at the 5% level but not the 1% level of
significance against the model with a single set of labor force structure
variables plus an intercept shift for 1984.8
In order to interpret the results quantitatively, the lower half of

table 5 contains mean predicted probabilities of the demand for union

representation for both 1977 and 1984. These probabilities are defined in the
same manner as the mean predicted probabilities of union membership computed

in the previous section. The estimates in the first column confirm a
statistically significant 13.0 percentage point drop between 1977 and 1984 in

the mean probability that a worker demands union representation. Once again,
the key finding is that, even after controlling for labor force structure, the
mean probability that a worker demands union representation is fully 10.9
percentage points lower in 1984 than in 1977.
The conclusions, consistent with the analysis in the previous section,

are 1) that changes in labor force structure can account for very little of
the overall decline in the demand for union representation over the past
decade and 2) that the difference between 1977 and 1984 in the demand for

Table 6 contains estimates of the choice—based probit model of the

of union membership in section V except that the model is estimated over the
sub—sample of only those workers who either are union members or are nonunion
but would vote affirmatively for union representation.

The model in the first column of table 6 includes only a constant and

that the parameters of the labor force structure variables are the same in
1977 and 1984.10

In order to interpret the results quantitatively, the lower half of

table 6 contains mean predicted probabilities for both 1977 and 1984 that a

worker is unionized conditional on demanding union representation. These
probabilities are defined in the same manner as the mean predicted

probabilities computed in the previous two sections. The estimates in the
first column confirm a statistically significant 9.1 percentage point drop
between 1977 and 1984 in the mean probability that a worker who demands union

representation is actually unionized. As before, the key finding is that,
even after controlling for labor force structure, the mean probability that a
worker is unionized conditional on demanding union representation is still
substantially lower (8.7 percentage points) in 1984 than in 1977.
The conclusions, consistent with the analyses in the previous two
sections, are 1) that changes in labor force structure can account for very
little of the overall decline over the past decade in the supply of union jobs
relative to demand and 2) that the raw difference between 1977 and 1984 in the
relative supply of union jobs is not simply an artifact of sample design
differences.

VIII. Increased Employ Resistance as an Explanation for the Decline in
Unionization
The evidence presented to this point clearly shows that insubstantial
fractions of the declines in the probability of unionization, the demand for

distributed as x with 18 degrees of freedom. There are nineteen labor force

20

union representation, and the relative supply of union jobs can be accounted

for by shifts in the structure of the labor force. This is consistent with
the view that the decline is associated with an increase in employer

resistance to unionization (Freeman, 1985). The key direct evidence for this
increased resistance is the dramatic decrease in the quantity of union

organizing activity and success over the last decade coupled with the equally
dramatic increase over the last decade in representation election related
unfair labor practice charges filed by unions against employers.

The form of increased employer resistance ranges from outright hostility
to unions to the improvement of wages and/or working conditions so that

workers don't feel they need union. One key tactic is to hire
labor—management consultants whose hallmark is defeating unions in

representation elections. Freeman (1985) outlines three approaches that these
consultants take. First, they can emphasize "positive labor relations" by
which it is meant having the nonunion employer provide a union—like
environment including higher wages, better fringe benefits, workplace

due—process, etc. Second, they can conduct a very active but legal campaign
that includes much communication with workers regarding their views of what
unionization will mean, gerrymandering of the unit of representation, and

delay of the election itself. Finally, they can conduct an illegal election
campaign by committing obvious unfair labor practices. There is evidence from
data on individual votes in actual NLRB elections that very active legal
campaigns and illegal campaigns have a significant influence on the outcomes

of representation elections (Dickens, 1983). In addition, there is evidence
that simply delaying the election significantly reduces the probability of
union success in representation elections (Roomkin and Block, 1981).

Table 7 contains data on trends in union organizing activity. The first
column of the table contains the percentage of nonunion workers who were
eligible to vote in National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) supervised

representation elections. Eligible workers are those who worked in potential
bargaining units where elections were held. This percentage fell from 1.15%
in 1970 to 0.27% in 1983, the last year for which data are available. This
measures the decline in the quantity of organizing activity undertaken, and it
may reflect increased employer resistance to union organizing for two reasons.
First, to the extent that increased employer resistance takes the form of

outright hostility to union organizing efforts, unions and workers will

perceive a lower probability of success in organizing efforts. The result is
that fewer elections will be undertaken, and the supply of union jobs relative

to demand (as measured in this study) will be reduced. Second, to the extent
that employer resistance takes the form of improved wages and working
conditions and 'tpositive labor relations", the measured demand for union

representation will be lower and there will be less election activity.

The second column of table 7 contains data on union success in the
elections that they do undertake as measured by the percentage of elections

undertaken that are won by unions. This percentage fell from 55.2% in 1970 to
43.0% in 1983. This is likely to reflect the increased sophistication of
employer responses to explicit organizing efforts and to result in a reduction

in the relative supply of union jobs. That employers are responding more
aggressively to union organizing efforts is clear from the data contained in
the third column of table 7 which show that. the number of employer unfair

labor practice charges per election rose from 2.61 in 1970 to 7.45 in 1982.

These unfair labor practices are a set of activities of employers that
are proscribed under the National Labor Relations Act because they are felt to
interfere with employees' rights to make a free decision regarding collective

organization. Examples are threats, harassment, firing, and unduly
pessimistic claims of what will result from unionization. This resistance
makes it more difficult for unions to organize for any given level of demand,

and unios and workers will

be less

willing to undertake organization efforts.

22

This can account for at least part of the decline in both the quantity of

election activity and union success with election activity documented in table
7.

The reasons for this increased employer resistance to unionization are

not clear. It may be that new and more effective tactics to resist union
organization have been invented in a manner analogous to technological

advancement in any production process. In particular, it has been argued
casually that the advent of labor—management consultants is just this sort of

event. However, it is more likely that the costs of unionization to firms
have increased. This would provide firms with an incentive to resist
unionization more strenuously than in the past both by utilizing existing
techniques for remaining nonunion and by "inventing" new and more effective

techniques. Viewed in this context, the increased use of labor—management
consultants is demand driven, and the discussion of increased employer
opposition must start with a discussion of how the economic environment has
changed with regard to the ability of unionized firms to compete successfully.
The most obvious change in the U. S. economy over the past decade is the
increased level of foreign competition, particularly in the manufacturing
sector that has formed the heart of the union movement in the United States.
Some newly tabulated data on import penetration illustrate this graphically.11

In 1958 only 2.5% of manufacturing sales in the U. S. were imports. This rose
to 7.2% by 1977 and to 11.0% by 1984.
To. the extent that unions raise production costs, some of this increase

in imports is likely to be due to the unions themselves. However, it is also
likely that other countries have rapidly developed industrial capacity that
rivals (and in some cases even surpasses) our own for reasons unrelated to

See Abbwd (1987) for a description of these data.

23

unionization in the United States. In any case, in the past, with no
significant foreign competition, it may be that American firms could afford to
accommodate higher costs associated with labor unions by sharing some of the

gains of a relatively closed economy with their workers. However, the
increased openness of the American economy may make it prohibitively expensive
to bear these higher costs because higher product prices will not be borne by
consumers who have attractive foreign alternatives.

Another structural change in the U. S. economy is the deregulation of

some key heavily unionized industries such as trucking and airlines. These
industries have become much more competitive since the government removed
entry barriers and rate regulation.12 In this more competitive environment
firms may resist unionization more strenuously than in the past because their
market position is no longer protected by the government.

Some recent evidence, developed by Abowd and Farber (1987), on the
relationship between the decline in union organizing activity and product

market competition in U. S. Nanufacturing is mixed. They argue that changes
in product market competition, as reflected in changes in the total quantity
of quasi—rents available to be divided between the union and the employer, is

an important determinant of the quantity of union organizing activity. As
expected, they find that union organizing activity is positively related to
the change in the total quantity of quasi—rents but that there is still a
substantial negative time trend to organizing activity that is not explained

by changes in product market competition. In addition, they are unable to
find any relationship between changes in import penetration and union

organizing activity. However, Cone (1987) finds that there is a positive

market power, and unions in the trucking industry. The problems of both the
firms and the unions in the airline industry are common knowledge.

24

relationship between changes in import penetration and employer unfair labor
practices.

Overall, increased employer resistance may account for some of the

decline in the demand for and relative supply of unionization. However, the
reasons for increased employer resistance are not well understood. An
important missing piece of the puzzle is a full understanding of the decline
in the demand for union representation among nonunion workers documented in

the last column of table 3. While this may be due in part to increased
employer resistance, particularly of the "positive labor relations" variety,

it may also be due to changing economic circumstances and attitudes among the

nonunion workforce. This is the focus of the next two sections.

IX. The Decline in the Demand for Unionization among Nonunion Workers:
Is it Explained bi Shifts in Labor Force Structure?
The decline in demand for unionization among nonunion workers is an
important contributor to the overall decline in the demand for unionization.

Evidence was presented earlier that the fraction of nonunion workers who
desired union representation fell from 39.5% to 32.4% between 1977 and 1984.
Further evidence of the long run decline in demand for union representation
comes from the data on NLRB supervised representation elections discussed in
the previous section and contained in table 7.

The possibility that the decline in the demand for unionization among
nonunion workers can be fully accounted for by structural shifts in the labor

force can be dismissed easily. Estimates of a simple probit model of the VFU
measure over the sample of nonunion workers including a constant and a dummy
variable for the AFL survey are contained in the first column of table 8.13

13Note that the undersampling of unionized workers in the ATh survey does not
affect this analysis because it deals strictly with nonunion workers.

The bottom panel of the table contains mean predicted probabilities that a
nonunion worker demands union representation first assuming that all 1482
workers are in 1977 and then assuming that all 1482 workers are in 1984.14

These results verify that the demand for union representation among nonunion
workers fell from 39.5% in 1977 to 32.4% in 1984 for a drop of 7.1 percentage
points.

Estimates of the probit model containing the 19 labor structure

variables are contained in the second column of table 8. Based on a
likelihood ratio test, these labor force structure variables clearly are
significantly related to the probability of that a nonunion worker demands
union representation.15 The coefficient of the AFI dummy variable is still
significantly negative at conventional levels.

The mean predicted

probabilities reported in the bottom panel of the table suggest that the
demand for union representation was a statistically significant 5.0 percentage

points lower in 1984 than in 1977. Thus, structural shifts can account for
about thirty percent of the decline in demand for union representation among
nonunion workers.

While the results are not presented here, the model was reestimated
allowing labor force structure to have different effects on the probability

that a nonunion worker demand union representation in the two years. A

reject the hypothesis at conventional levels that the parameters of the labor

X. Job Satisfactioi Union InstrumentalitL and the Deci

in Demand

An important theme in an earlier literature on the demand for union
representation is that workers join unions in order both to improve their

wages and to protect themselves from what they feel is arbitrary treatment by

their supervisors (Rees, 1962). Seidman, Karsh, and London (1951), in their
important study of "Why Workers Join Unions" argue (p.77)

that personal experiences in the plant play a large part in the
thinking of workers, and that an unpleasant personal experience becomes
a powerful motivation that turns workers toward a union . .

Following

. ."

these arguments, Farber and Saks (1980) investigate the role that

a worker's satisfaction with his/her job and a worker's perceptions of the

ability of unions to address problems on the job play in determining a

worker's vote in a representation election. They find strong support for the
view that workers are more likely to vote for union representation when they
are dissatisfied and feel that unions can improve conditions in the relevant
dimension.

These considerations are relevant for the analysis of the decline in the

demand for union representation among nonunion workers. By working with a
sample of strictly nonunion workers it is appropriate to investigate the role
of subjective variables, specifically measures of job satisfaction and worker
attitudes toward unions in general, that may play a key role in determining

the demand for union representation. It would not be appropriate to analyze
these variables across union and nonunion jobs because they would play very

27

different roles. For exanpie, we would expect that nonunion workers who were
dissatisfied with their job to be more likely to demand union representation.
At the same time, union members who were dissatisfied with their job would be
less favorably disposed toward union representation.
It is fortunate that the QES and the AFL survey have comparable measures
of job satisfaction in two key dimensions (pay and job security) as well as

overall job satisfaction. The three measures of satisfaction were developed
using a four value response scale. These were recoded to two values (1 =

satisfied,

0 =

not

satisfied) 17 The two surveys also have comparable measures

of worker perceptions of the ability of unions in the abstract to improve

wages and working conditions (union instrumentality). This was also recoded
from a four value response scale to two values (1= unions improve wages and
working conditions, 0 = unions do not).

18

In both surveys, the questions

referred to are worded virtually identically, and the allowed responses are

scaled alike. While there may be problems due to the fact that the two
surveys are different in overall structure, the properties of the samples are
similar enough and the particular questions are similar enough to proceed with
a comparison with some confidence.
The first part of table 9 contains information on the fraction of the
workers in the QES and AFLI samples that reported satisfaction in each of the

three dimensions. It is clear from this table that both union and nonunion
workers reported very high levels of overall satisfaction with their jobs in

1977 and 1984. Union workers' satisfaction fell slightly between 1977 and

17

The four possible responses to these questions (How satisfied are you with
• ?) were 1) very satisfied, 2) somewhat satisfied, 3) somewhat
dissatisfied, and 4) very dissatisfied.
question was "Tell me if you 1) agree strongly, 2) agree somewhat, 3)
disagree somewhat, or 4) disagree strongly that unions improve the wages and
working conditions of workers."

1984 while nonunion workers' satisfaction rose slightly. Union workers report
slightly lower levels of satisfaction in 1977 with the specific aspects of

their jobs reported on in table 3, but these levels rose slightly by 1984. A
substantially different picture emerges from analysis of the satisfaction of

nonunion workers with specific aspects of their jobs. Aside from the
relatively low reported satisfaction with pay in 1977, the most striking
result is that reported levels of satisfaction with pay and job security among

nonunion workers rose dramatically between 1977 and 1984. This suggests that
at least part of the decline in the demand for unionization may be due to less
dissatisfaction on the part of nonunion workers.

The reasons for this increase in perceived job satisfaction are not

clear. Satisfaction with pay may reflect how workers evaluate their pay
relative to either their best alternatives or to some norm that they consider

equitable. Given the well known decline in real earnings since the
mid—1970's, the general increase in worker satisfaction with pay then suggests

that the standards against which workers judge their wages fell. In other
words the period from 1977 through 1984 is marked by declining expectations,
and this may be a cause of the decrease in demand for union representation.
It may also be that the increased reported satisfaction is the result of

cognitive dissonance by workers. This argument runs that the chances of
workers improving their current situation have deteriorated since 1977 and
that workers protect themselves psychologically by convincing themselves that

they are satisfied with the current situation. In other words, it is
unhealthy for an individual to be unhappy about a situation over which he/she

has no control so a natural defense is to convince oneself that he/she is not

unhappy.
It is tempting to argue that the measured increase in satisfaction among
nonunion workers is a statistical artifact due to the fact that the
satisfaction measures were derived frorn

cuite

different surveys in different

29

environments. However, the contrast between the union and nonunion fractions
in table 9 belie this argument. If there were a systematic bias in the
responses, say toward more satisfaction in the AFL survey, we would expect

this to show up in the union responses as well as the nonunion responses. The
fact that it does not is strong evidence that there has been a "real'
change.

With regard to union instrumentality, the numbers in the second part of
table 9 suggest that, while most nonunion workers still believe that unions
improve the wages and working conditions of workers, the fraction of nonunion
workers who believe that unions are effective in this dimension fell

substantially from 1977 to 1984. Thus, nonunion workers are less likely to
believe that unions can help with a central area of concern on the job, and
this too may be a cause of the decline in demand for union representation.
Over the same period of time, the fraction of union workers who reported that
they believe that unions improve wages and working conditions actually
increased slightly.

It remains to demonstrate the links between worker preferences for union
representation and these subjective measures of job satisfaction and union

instrumentality. The third column of table 8 contains estimates of a simple
probit model of th demand for union representation among nonunion workers
that includes the four subjective variables along with the set of controls for

labor force structure. All of the satisfaction measures have a statistically
significant effect (p—values < .001) in the hypothesized direction on nonunion

workers' preferences for union representation. Workers who are satisfied with
their job are significantly less likely to demand union representation. The
single measure of union instrumentality also performs as expected. Workers
who feel that unions improve pay and working conditions are significantly more
likely to desire union representation than workers who do not feel that unions
are instrumental

in this dimension.

30

While the results are not presented here, the model was reestimated
allowing the labor force structure, job satisfaction, and union
instrumentality variables to have different effects on the probability that a

nonunion worker demand union representation in the two years. A separate
probit model was estimated for each year, and it is not possible to reject the
hypothesis at conventional levels that the parameters of the labor force
structure variables are the same in 1977 and 1984.19

To get a feel for the magnitude of the effects of job satisfaction on
the demand for union representation, table 10 contains mean predicted

probabilities over the entire sample of 1482 nonunion workers assuming
particular configurations of the satisfaction variables for all workers.

These are based on the estimates in column 3 of table 8, and the magnitudes

are impressive. If it is assumed that all workers are not satisfied with
their job overall (SAT=0), the mean probability that a nonunion worker demands
union representation is fully 23 percentage points higher (s.e. =

4.1) than in

the case where it is assumed that all workers are satisfied with their job
(SA'r=l). The difference is somewhat smaller, though still quite large for

the other two measures of satisfaction. If it is assumed that all workers are
not satisfied in any of the dimensions, the mean probability that a worker
demands union representation is a dramatic 47.4 percentage points higher (s.e.
=

4.2)

than in the case where all workers are satisfied in all three

dimensions.

Table 10 also contains mean predicted probabilities assuming particular

configurations of the union instrumentality variable. It is clear that worker
perceptions of union instrumentality are quite important. If all workers are
assumed to feel that unions improve wages and working conditions, the mean

The likelihood,ratio test statistic is 26.0 (p—value = .301) which is
distributed as x with 23 degrees of freedom.

31

probability that a worker demands union representation is 17.2 percentage

points higher (s.e. =

2.7)

than in the case where no workers feel that unions

improve wages and working conditions. This works quite powerfully in
conjunction with the satisfaction measures. In the extreme case, where all
workers feel that unions improve wages and working conditions and where all
workers are not satisfied in any of the three dimensions, the mean probability
that a worker demands union representation is 63.7 percentage points higher
(s.e. =

4.4)

than in the case where no workers feel that unions improve wages

and working conditions and all workers are satisfied with their jobs in each
of the three dimensions.

The conclusion from the analysis in table 10 is that job satisfaction
and perceptions of union instrumentality are very important factors in

individual worker demand for union representation. The magnitude of the
effects of these variables dwarfs the decline in demand between 1977 and 1984

summarized in table 8. This lends strong support to the views, expressed in
the earlier literature and cited earlier in this section, that a central force
motivating workers to demand union representation is "unpleasant personal
experience" in Seidman, Karsh, and London's (1951) terms.
With regard to the decline in the demand for unionization between 1977
and 1984, it is clear from the estimates in the third column of table 8, that
the coefficient of the AFL dummy variable is not significantly different from
zero at any reasonable level after controlling f or the satisfaction and

instrumentality variables. The mean predicted probabilities in the third
column of table 8 verify that the probability that a nonunion worker demands
union representation is no lower in 1984 than in 1977 after controlling for
the satisfaction and instrumentality variables.
Although the results are not presented here, the probit model in the
third column of table 8 was reestintated using

various

subsets of the

satisfaction and instrumentality variables in order to gain some insight into

32

which variable accounts for the disappearance of the decline between 1977 and

1984. No clear answer emerges. Including any one of the four subjective
variables reduces the effect noted in column 2 of table 8. The difference in
predicted mean probabilities is still negative but generally insignificantly

different from zero. Inclusion of overall satisfaction (SAT) has the smallest
effect on the 1984—1977 difference, while inclusion of any one of the other
three measures (SATPAY, SATSEC, or UIMPPAY) has a large effect on the
difference.

Overall, the decline in demand for union representation by nonunion
workers is fully accounted for by measures of job satisfaction and worker

perceptions of union instrumentality. Nonunion workers who are dissatisfied
with various aspects of their job and/or who perceive that unions improve
wages and working conditions are more likely to demand union representation.
However, for reasons that are not well understood workers are reporting higher
levels of satisfaction in 1984 than in 1977 along with less expectation that
unions are instrumental in improving jobs.

XI. Concluding Remarks
The dramatic decline since the mid—1970's in the fraction of the labor
force that is unionized is a phenomenon that is not yet fully understood.
Indirect evidence was presented here which showed that employer resistance to
unionization has increased and that, as a result, the ability of workers who

desire union jobs to find such jobs has decreased. This is formalized as a
decline in the supply of union jobs relative to demand. Evidence was also
presented that the demand for union representation among nonunion workers has

declined substantially since the mid—1970's. It was found that very little of
the declines in these quantities can be accounted for by changes in the
structure of the labor force.

One strong result that

was found is that the decline in demand for

33

unionization can be fully accounted for by an increase in the satisfaction of
nonunion workers with their jobs and a decrease in their belief that unions
are instrumental in improving wages and working conditions of workers in

general. However, the rationale for this is not obvious. Objectively,
nonunion workers were no better off in 1984 than they were in 1977, but

satisfaction levels increased. It may be that the economic dislocations of
the 1970's and the increased competitiveness of the economy have reduced
workers' expectations.

The most obvious unresolved issue is exactly why employer resistance to

unionization has increased so dramatically. One obvious answer is the
increased competitiveness of U. S. markets, both in markets for traded goods

and in previously regulated domestic markets. In this more competitive
environment firms may feel that they must be more cost conscious than they

needed to be twenty years ago if they are to thrive. Recent work by Abowd and
Farber (1987) partially supports this view. A related unresolved issue is the
extent to which the increased international competitiveness is due to union
policies that raise employment costs.
Another answer to the question of increased employer resistance is that
the political and social climate may have changed so that the role that unions
have played in American society and the economy is being called into serious

question for the first time since that role was defined in the 1930's. Some
recent work completed at ?1.I.T. (Kochan, Katz, and McKersie, 1986) suggests

the following scenario. Employers have never accepted unions as an integral
part of their firms, but until the 1970's overt anti—union behavior was not

socially or politically acceptable. The compact forged in the 1930's and
codified as public policy in the NLRA protected the union movement. In the
2.960's employers began to implement effective strategies to remain nonunion

when opening new plants. ''ith the economic recessions of the 1970's and
1980's, more overt anti—union behavior becane socially and politically

34

acceptable, turning what had been a stagnation of the union movement into a

virtual rout. Explicit anti—union strategies, including such tactics as
development of innovative nonunion personnel systems, active resistance to
organizing efforts, and siting of plants in locations unsympathetic to unions,
have become the standard mode of operation in U. S. industry.

While the change in the strategy of employers could be thought to be the
result of changes in social and political attitudes that arose independently
of economic factors, it is reasonable to conclude that both employers'
strategies and general attitudes toward unions have been affected by the

dramatic changes in the U. S. economy over the past two decades. These
changes, toward an increasingly competitive economy, have made the costs of

unionization to firms much higher than they were thirty or even twenty years
ago.

What can the union movement do to recoup its losses? The results on
the relationship between worker demand for union representation on the one

hand and job satisfaction and union instrumentality on the other suggest that
the task is to convince workers of the effective role that unions play in the

workplace. However, it may be that until workers feel less satisfaction with
their jobs, this is a nearly impossible task. The recurring theme is that the
competitiveness of the economy has increased dramatically. Unions need to
convince workers that they offer real value in a competitive environment.
