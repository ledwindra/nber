    "abstract": "\n\nThis study of the U.S. semiconductor industry seeks to examine its international pattern of exports, licensing, and foreign investments. This industry was selected for study because previous work had shown the United States tended to have a favorable trade balance in industries characterized by high technology processes or products. The study is divided into three parts. The first part, consisting of Chapters 2 and 3, discusses the characteristics of the U.S. semiconductor industry and semiconductor technology. The next part, Chapters 4, 5 and 6 examines the different transfer channels and the factors which determine a firm's selection between exports, licensing, and foreign production to supply foreign markets. The final section, Chapter 7, seeks to determine the characteristics of the American firms most responsible for the transfer of technology offshore and the impact of foreign direct investment on trade patterns.\n\n",
