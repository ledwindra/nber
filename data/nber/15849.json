    "abstract": "\n\nPublic-place smoking restrictions are the most important non-price tobacco control measures worldwide, yet surprisingly little is known about their effects on exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS).  We study these laws in Canada using data with questions about respondents' ETS exposure in public and private places.  In fixed-effects models we find these laws had no effects on smoking but induced large and statistically significant reductions in public-place ETS exposure, especially in bars and restaurants.  We do not find significant evidence of ETS displacement to private homes.  Our results indicate wide latitude for health improvements from banning smoking in public places.\n\n",
