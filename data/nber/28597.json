    "abstract": "\n\nDuring the nineteenth century the United States urbanized \u2013 the share of the population living in urban areas increased \u2013 and industrialized \u2013 the share of the labor force in manufacturing increased. Our survey of the literature and analyses of census data suggests that a key reason was the development of a nationwide transportation system, especially the railroad. Coupled with changes in manufacturing technology and organizational form, the \u201ctransportation revolution\u201d increased demand for manufacturing labor in urban locations. Labor supply responded and because of agglomeration economies, population density and the size and number of urban places increased. Although our focus is on the US experience, a causal role for transportation is likely for other economies that experienced historical industrialization and urbanization.\n\n",
