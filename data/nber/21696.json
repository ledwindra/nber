    "abstract": "\n\nSize-discovery trade mechanisms allow large quantities of an asset to be exchanged at a price that does not respond to price pressure. Primary examples include \u201cworkup\u201d in Treasury markets, \u201cmatching sessions\u201d in corporate bond and CDS markets, and block-trading \u201cdark pools\u201d in equity markets. By freezing the execution price and giving up on market-clearing, size-discovery mechanisms overcome concerns by large investors over their price impacts. Price-discovery mechanisms clear the market, but cause investors to internalize their price impacts, inducing costly delays in the reduction of position imbalances. We show how augmenting a price-discovery mechanism with a size-discovery mechanism improves allocative efficiency.\n\n",
