    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper studies information diffusion in social media and the role of bots in shaping public opinions. Using Twitter data on the 2016 E.U. Referendum (\u201cBrexit\u201d) and the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election, we find that diffusion of information on Twitter is largely complete within 1-2 hours. Stronger interactions across agents with similar beliefs are consistent with the \u201cecho chambers\u201d view of social media. Bots have a tangible effect on the tweeting activity of humans but the degree of bots\u2019 influence depends on whether bots provide information consistent with humans\u2019 priors. Overall, our results suggest that the aggressive use of Twitter bots, coupled with the fragmentation of social media and the role of sentiment, could contribute to the vote outcomes.\n\n",
