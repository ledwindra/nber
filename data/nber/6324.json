As a result, current short-term rates are not\" sufficient to predict future short-term rates movements, as would be the case if the central\" tendency was constant.  However, since longer-maturity bond prices incorporate information\" about the central tendency, longer-maturity bond yields can be used to predict future short-term\" rate movements.  We develop a two-factor model of the term-structure which implies that a\" linear combination of any two rates can be used as a proxy for the central tendency.  Based on\" this central-tendency proxy, we estimate a model of the one-month rate which performs better\" than models which assume the central tendency to be constant.\n\n",
