I. INTRODUCTION
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has been
controversial since it was established in 1970.

Observers have challenged

the agency's efforts on worker safety, arguing occupational disease

presents a more serious case for government action2 because workers
experience greater difficulty collecting risk information for long—term
disease hazards than for more immediate injury risks.

Consequently,

neither the wage—setting process nor the workers' compensation system
internalize the costs of occupational disease as effectively as for
occupational injuries.3

Given the current regulatory approach to

workplace health and safety, analysts further assert that OSHA health
standards are more effectively designed to reduce future occupational
disease than OSHA safety standards are designed to reduce accidents.
Safety engineers have determined that the majority of injuries are not
related to the violation of OSHA safety standards and would occur despite
perfect compliance.4

On the other hand, OSHA health standards establish

making since 1972 have been challenged on cost-benefit grounds.5

Though

OSHA standard—setting does not explicitly incorporate cost—benefit
principles, the Supreme Court decided in the benzene case6 and affirmed in
the cotton dust case' that, for each new standard, OSHA must show that
"significant risks" currently exist and can be eliminated or reduced with
the proposed regulation.

OSHA also adopted Threshold Limit Values (TLV)

for 400 chemical substances in 1971 and an additional 168 chemicals in
1988, by reference from the voluntary standards of the American Committee
of Government Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), a consensus—based
organization.

The goals for risk-reduction In ACGIH standard-setting

appear to be less stringent than for OSHA standards promulgated through
rule—making.

Mendeloff (1988) compiled and re—evaluated the historical record of
cost and benefit studies for health standards. In his data (Table 2.1,
p. 22), the accepted estimates of the willingness—to-pay for a life
saved ($1.6—$8.3 million in 1985$; Fisher et al., 1989) fall within
the range of costs per cancer prevented for all health standards (with
cancer risks) promulgated through rule—making, except vinyl chloride.
Employing an estimate of $2.5 million per life—saved, Mendeloff
concludes that several standards are probably too stringent according
to cost-benefit criteria, though the excess stringency is perhaps not
as great as some critics have suggested. (p. xv)

Despite greater expectations for OSHA's intervention to reduce health
risks, lack of suitable data to measure health effects has restricted most
statistical studies of OSHA to examining safety performance.9 Though some

early studies suggested OSHA had no effect on workplace injuries, current
research with longitudinal plant-level data indicates that OSHA has had a

small, salutary effect on reducing injuries.'0 Because the effect of the

research to date may substantially under—represent OSHA's total effect on
workplace quality.

Direct measurement of the incidence of occupational disease is
extremely difficult because of the confluence of several factors: long
latency periods (frequently 10—25 years) between initial workplace
exposure to hazardous substances and the onset of disease;

mobility of

workers across establishments; and, sometimes, inaccurate diagnoses or
inaccurate attribution of causation for diseases.

As a result, there is

DATA

The source of data for the analysis is OSHA's enforcement Management

and company compliance performance.

The version of the MIS data obtained

for this study includes the 63,383 federal health inspections performed in

37,639 manufacturing establishments between 1972 and the middle of 1983.
In order to create longitudinal records of plant inspection histories,

Gray (1986) matched all inspections of individual establishments using

conditioning procedure in the Andersen ML.E technique, we only include up

This truncation does not result in

the loss of any plants, but does eliminate 2909 health inspections of

sequence order 6 and above (4.6% of all inspections) in 984 heavily

V. E1PIRICAL RESULTS
The major issue considered in this paper is: do OSHA's enforcement

efforts deter violations of OSHA health standards?

To address this issue

we estimate each of the four models developed above, both with and without
plant—specific fixed effects.

For the versions of the model without fixed

effects, we control for the selection effect by incorporating the variable
HNUMINSP, the total number of health inspections experienced by a plant,
as a proxy for the plant fixed effect.

As with the inspection—sequence

series of variables [HSEQNUMI, we create dummy variables for values of
HNUMINSP equal to 1 through

523

Tables 1 and 2 report the estimates of the determinants of the total
number of citations, NUMCITE, and the number of exposure violations
reported, NUMBAD, respectively.

Across all specifications for both

variables, the results are consistent with the qualitative conclusions
that (1) both measures of violation (worker exposure violations and

citations of standards) decrease with additional inspections, and (2) the
first health inspection has the strongest impact in reducing violations.

We first consider the results for NUMCITE presented in Table 1.
all four models, the fixed-effects framework cannot be rejected.

In

The

coefficients on the health inspection variables (IISEQNUMJ) are somewhat
larger (and the differences are statistically significant) in the fixed—
effects versions.

However, the estimates of the impact of OSHA

Because the specification of the mean function is a critical
component in the implementation of the count models, we are particularly
interested in specification testing for models 1 and 2.

Alternatively, we use the Sargan test which indicates the log—linear model

For NUMCITE [mean=2.5, sd=5.2J, the pattern of inspection effects is
very similar for models 1, 2, and 3.

The log—linear results (Col. 2.2)

indicate that the first—inspection effect is to reduce citations by —2.0,

with subsequent inspections yielding reductions of - .5,

and —.14

pattern for the average manufacturing plant of -2.4 (-.5 Sd).

For the

Poisson model, the estimated total effect is approximately the same, -2.7
citations (—.5 Sd); with reductions declining across inspections, -1.9,
—1.0, —.4, —.2.

The negative binomial model estimates OSHA's total effect

to be 20% lower than the other three models: —1.9 citations (-.2), with
the reductions concentrated on the first inspection (—1.8 citations), with
subsequent inspections yielding reductions of —.15, —.15, —.01 citations.

Note the effect of an inspection is observed in the subsequent
inspection.

The estimates of total effects cited above assume that the

(unobserved) effect of the last inspection for each plant is equal to the
effect measured for that inspection sequence number in the sub-set of the
sample receiving additional inspections.27

Alternatively, "more

conservative" estimates of the effect of OSHA inspections during 1972—83,

VI. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION OF RESULTS

In

this paper, we provide the first estimates of the impact of OSHA

health—related enforcement on compliance throughout the manufacturing sector.

We resolved the lack—of-data impediment to research on OSHA's health effects
by creating violation measures from the data on exposure samples and citations
recorded by OSHA inspectors in the agency enforcement MIS.

Two major conclusions are robust across the range of linear and count
models estimated in the paper: (1) both the number of citations of OSHA
standards and the number of violations of worker exposure limits decrease with
additional health inspections in manufacturing plants; and (2) the first
health inspection has the strongest impact.

The best estimates, based on the

fixed—effects negative binomial models, suggest that in ever-inspected

manufacturing plants, OSHA health inspections during the first twelve years of
the agency operation have reduced the number of citations on average by -2 or

-.4 sd and have reduced the number of detected exposure violations by - .4 or
—.23 sd.29

The ranges of estimates across the models are for reductions from

—1.9 to —2.7 citations and for reductions of —.4 to —.5 worker overexposures samples.

The methodology does not allow us to estimate the

29. The estimated reduction in citations induced by health inspections
presented In this paper is of comparable magnitude to the estimated
reduction reported in our earlier study, focusing on safety inspections
(80Z of all OSHA inspections). With a Tobit model, we estimated
inspection effects on citations of (-2.3, —.6, —.5 and -.3); with a linear
fixed—effects model, the estimated inspection effects were somewhat larger
(—2.9, —1.4, —.8, and —.9). The average effect of OSHA inspections
