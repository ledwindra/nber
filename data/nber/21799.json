    "abstract": "\n\nCongress first imposed an aggregate debt limit in 1939 when it delegated  decisions about designing US debt instruments to the Treasury. Before World War I, Congress designed each  bond and specified a maximum amount of each bond that the Treasury could  issue.  It  usually specified purposes for which  proceeds could be spent. We  construct and interpret a Federal debt limit before 1939.\n\n",
