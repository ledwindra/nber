ABSTRACT
The relationship between population health and measures of economic well-being and economic
activity is a long standing topic in health economics (Preston, 1975; Cutler, Deaton, and LlerasMuney, 2006; Ruhm, 2000). The conceptual issues in analyzing the complicated link between
health and economic well-being are central to understanding the implications of the COVID-19
epidemic in the United States The public health shock of the epidemic has direct economic
impacts, but the mitigation policies governments are using to control the spread of the virus may
also damage economic activity. We estimate how state job market conditions respond to state
COVID-19 infections and school closures, which are the earliest of the major mitigation policies.
Mitigation policies and local epidemiological conditions explain some of the variation in
unemployment patterns. However, the historically unprecedented increase in new UI claims
during the weeks of March 15-21 and March 22-28 was largely across-the-board and occurred in
all states. This suggests most of the economic disruption was driven by the health shock itself.
Put differently, it appears that the labor market slowdown was due primarily to a nationwide
response to evolving epidemiological conditions and that individual state policies and own
epidemiologic situations have had a comparatively modest effect.

1.Introduction
The coronavirus epidemic has caused more than 190,000 deaths around the world, and at least 50,000
deaths in the United States as of this writing. During the first few months of 2020, government and private
efforts to prevent the spread of the virus reshaped daily life in the United States. Schools and businesses
closed on a massive scale, and states issued shelter in place orders requiring people to stay home. As
the epidemic continues, it will be crucial to balance the economic harms of these measures against their
ability to reduce viral transmission. The relationship between population health and economic well-being
and economic activity is a longstanding topic of interest in health economics. Previous work documents
that stable relationships between population health and measures of wealth can be disrupted by large
changes in epidemiological conditions, such as the HIV/AIDS epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa (Cutler,
Deaton, and Lleras-Muney, 2006; Preston, 1975). There is also evidence that mortality and morbidity
depend on macroeconomic conditions (Hollingsworth et al, 2019; Ruhm, 2000), and that both working
conditions and involuntary unemployment affect health outcomes (Fletcher et al, 2011; Sullivan and Von
Wachter, 2009). Evidence from historical epidemics and simulation models suggest social distancing can
slow the spread of the virus (Chinazzi et al 2020; Fang et al 2020; Ferguson et al 2020; Bootsma and
Ferguson, 2007; Ferguson et al 2006). To shed light on the relative effects of policies vs. private
responses, this article examines the association between local unemployment insurance claims,
epidemiological conditions, and the earliest form of local policy responses – school closures.
Given the decentralized structure of the American government, state policy makers have become critical
actors and have exercised considerable discretion over the mitigation policies used to control the
epidemic. Some observers and policy makers have suggested that the economic and health damages of
the policy response may be worse than the epidemic itself (Bendavid and Bhattacharya 2020; Ioannidis
2020; Trump 2020). The third week of March 2020 saw a historically unprecedented spike in new claims
for unemployment insurance (UI) (DOL 2020). UI claims have continued to grow since then, and some
states are already considering weakening their mitigation policies to reduce job losses. Pressure to do so
will rise in the coming weeks. However, it is unclear how much of the rise in unemployment was driven by
shut-down policies. Even without government mandates, private decisions to avoid social interactions in
response to the epidemic would have reduced demand for activities like retail, air travel, hotel rooms, and
on-site restaurant meals. We provide early evidence that the bulk of the spike in UI claims seems to
reflect the national and international COVID-19 crisis as opposed to local COVID-19 cases or local policy
responses.
2.Data and Methods
We measure labor market activity using weekly new UI claims per covered worker in each U.S. state,
including Washington DC, and Puerto Rico. (We use the number of covered workers in January 2020 as
a fixed denominator.) Our measure of epidemiological conditions is confirmed COVID-19 cases per capita
in each state-week (New York Times, 2020). We measure the intensity of state school closures by
combining district and state level school closures data (Education Week 2020) with NCES data on school
district enrollment to compute the fraction of school days missed by the average child in each state and
week (NCES 2018). Table 1 shows descriptive statistics. Our data covers the period from the first week of
2020 to the week ending on March 28, 2020. Descriptive statistics for each week in March are in Table
S.1.
School closures are one of the earliest mitigation policies (Gupta et al, 2020). They typically started at the
district level before becoming a state-wide policy. They likely increase social distancing, but they also
reduce consumer and labor demand in many markets, and they may make it hard for parents to remain
productive in the workforce given childcare responsibilities. To unpack the role of policy and
epidemiological conditions on UI claims, we regressed log UI claims on school closure rates, COVID-19
case rates, and state and time fixed effects. We fit a restricted model with a time-invariant slope on school
closures and COVID-19 cases, and an unrestricted model that allows these effects to vary over time.

1) ln(𝑦𝑦)𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 = 𝛽𝛽1 ∙ 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 + 𝛽𝛽2 ∙ ln(𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐷𝐷𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 ) + 𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡 + 𝜖𝜖𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠

2) ln(𝑦𝑦)𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 = 𝛽𝛽1 ∙ 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 + 𝛽𝛽2 ∙ ln(𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐷𝐷𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 ) + 𝜂𝜂𝑡𝑡 (School Closuresst ∙ I 𝑇𝑇=𝑡𝑡 ) +
𝜉𝜉𝑡𝑡 (ln(𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐷𝐷𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 ) ∙ I 𝑇𝑇=𝑡𝑡 ) + 𝜃𝜃𝑠𝑠 + 𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡 + 𝜖𝜖𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠

In these models, 𝑦𝑦𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 represents new UI claims per 1,000 workers in week 𝑡𝑡 in state 𝑠𝑠. 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠
represents the fraction of school days missed by the average child in each state and week (Education
Week 2020; NCES 2018), and 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐷𝐷𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 is the number of confirmed cases per capita. The fixed time
effects capture shocks common to all labor markets in the U.S.

3. Results

In Figure 1 – Panel A, we separate the states into high, medium, and low COVID-19 case rates and link
them to the UI claims (per 1,000 workers) over time. In the weeks leading up to March 15-21, the three
groups of states had roughly 1.46 weekly claims per 1,000 workers. Then the UI claims rate spiked in all
three groups. The states with higher rates of infection experienced a larger increase in new UI claims.
Compared to the week ending on March 14th, by March 21th, UI claims grew by 1,281% in high COVID-19
states, and by 1,095% in low COVID-19 states. By March 28th, in low infection states there were 39.5 UI
claims per 1,000 workers whereas in low infection states there were 34.5. Thus, the differences in the
size of the spike in new UI claims are small compared to the overall change experienced by all states.
In Figure 1 – Panel B we divide the states into three groups based this time on the share of school days
missed per child. Once again, the three groups had similar UI claim rates in the weeks leading up to
March 15-21. The size of the spike by March 21st in UI claims was larger in states with the most intensive
school closures (1,704% increase) compared to the intermediate group (1,047% increase), and the
lowest group (593%). However, even the smallest response implies a record setting 6-fold increase in UI
claims in only one week. Thus, the data recording the immediate labor market response suggest that
local school closures policy and local epidemiological conditions do matter, but they are secondary
determinants of the deterioration in labor market outcomes so far.
Table 2 shows estimates from several versions of equations (1) and (2). These estimates are weighted by
state population and exclude NY, which was an outlier. (See table S1 for results that include NY and table
S2 for unweighted results.) Table 2 Column 1 only includes time dummies and does not adjust for school
closures or COVID-19 cases. Columns 2-4 add School Closures, School Closures × time interactions,
and state fixed effects. Columns 5-7 repeat the sequence with COVID-19 cases. Columns 8-10 include
both School Closures and COVID-19 cases, with columns 8 and 10 showing the full specifications
presented in (1) and (2). There are two main patterns. First, the school closures and the number of cases
have low explanatory power relative to the time variables. Second, even if significant, the school closures
and cases are not robust to model saturation. Because it emphasizes the common time effects rather
than time varying slopes, the model in column 8 is our preferred specification.
Figure 2 plots the relationship between UI claims, time, local COVID-19 cases, and school closures using
the time-invariant coefficients model shown in Table 2 – Column 8. The graph plots the natural logarithm
of new UI claims per worker against COVID-19 cases per capita (Panel A), and against the share of
school days missed per student (Panel B). Both panels show the fitted line holding other variables
constant at the mean on the given date. The markers for each state are sized in proportion to their
population in 2019. State UI claims are shown in orange for March 8-14, green for March 15-21, and
black for the week of March 22-28.
Figure 2 – Panel A shows that when New York is excluded from the data, UI claims per 1,000 workers are
higher in states with higher COVID-19 case rates. The regression model implies that – after adjusting for
the time period effect and school closures – increasing a state’s COVID-19 case rate from the nationwide
average in March 8-14 (0.75 cases per 100,000 individuals) to the nationwide average in March 15-21
(6.5 cases per 100,000 individuals) would have increased the new UI claims rate by about 2.3% (SE
7.1%). If the movement would have been from the baseline in March 8-14, all the way to the nationwide

average in March 22-28 (29.9 cases per 100,000 individuals), the increase in new UI claims would have
been 13.2% (SE 6.1%). However, controlling for state COVID-19 case rates explains very little of the
large jump in claims associated with the week of March 15-21. In other words, the week effect is large
relative to the COVID-19 gradient. Regression estimates including New York, shown in Figure S.1, are
essentially flat because New York’s new UI claims are considerably lower than one would expect based
on its very high rate of COVID-19 cases.
Figure 2 – Panel B shows that the share of school days missed in a state is associated with more UI
claims. The regression model implies that – after adjusting for the time period effect and state COVID-19
case rates – switching from no school closures in a week to all schools being closed for a week would
increase the UI claims rate by 139.8% (SE 94%), although these estimates are very imprecise. This
change is small compared to the nationwide jump in UI claims for the week of March 15-21. Regression
estimates imply that the new UI claims grew from the baseline in March 8-14 by 453.9% (SE 190%) in the
average state even after adjusting for state school closures and COVID-19 case rates. Growth from the
baseline in March 8-14, up to March 22-28 implied an increase of 828.8% (SE 3.77%).
The regression model provides a benchmark of expected unemployment rate in a state given national
patterns and local conditions. Some states deviate substantially from what would be expected based on
the model. For example, Hawaii, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Michigan and Rhode Island have
unemployment claims that are considerably higher than the model predictions. In contrast, South Dakota,
Connecticut, Wyoming, Utah and Colorado have lower unemployment claims than predicted (see Table
S.4).
4. Discussion
The COVID-19 epidemic has generated a huge and very sudden increase in unemployment claims in the
United States. Our analysis decomposes the overall changes in employment into nationwide shocks and
state level variation in local health conditions and early policy responses. The bulk of the spike in UI
claims seems to reflect the national and international COVID-19 crisis as opposed to local COVID-19
cases or local policy responses. The estimates suggest that it is unlikely that states could have avoided
the huge spike in job losses by avoiding early school closures. However, the data do suggest that both
school closures and state level measures of the severity of the epidemic are also associated to some
degree with more UI claims. This analysis may be relevant for state policy makers as they assess impacts
of tightening or loosening of social distancing policy actions.
The results in this note are relevant to the health economics literature on population health and economic
activity. They show that negative public health shocks can have enormous effects on labor markets that
dwarf the effects of policies designed to mitigate the epidemic itself. It is not yet known whether the job
losses occurred where the epidemic was expected to grow more rapidly or whether states took stronger
closure actions when they expected more rapid expansion in the scale of the local epidemic. In
interpreting our estimates, we emphasize that our short-term assessment is no substitute for later longterm analysis of responses. Even among short term measures, the April Current Population Survey will
enable analyses of the incidence of unemployment across various groups. In addition, our analysis is not
based on a randomized experiment so causal inferences should be made cautiously. Nevertheless, state
policy makers face a series of choices in the immediate future, and our analysis may help inform those
decisions and more broadly, the literature on population health and the economy.

Figure 1. Time trends in New Unemployment Insurance Claims by COVID-19 Cases and School Closures.

Panel A and Panel B of Figure 1 show time trends in new Unemployment Insurance (UI) claims grouped by state COVID-19 infection rates and
school closures. The horizontal axis shows weeks since January 1st, 2020, and the vertical axis is the log number of unemployment
insurance claims per 1,000 workers. Each panel reports time trends for three groups. In Panel A, states are divided into those with a low, medium,
or high number of COVID-19 cases per capita as of March 21st. Panel B splits the states into low, medium, and high groups based on the share of
school time students lost during the corresponding week due to school closures as of March 21st. The time trends, in both panels, spike in
correspondence of the fourth week of March (22-28 March). The steepness of the spike appears sharpest for states with the earliest school
closure and highest per capita COVID-19 cases.

Figure 2

Panel A shows the relationship between the weekly per capita COVID-19 cases in each state on the horizontal axis and log of new unemployment
insurance claims that week per 1,000 workers on the vertical axis. Panel B shows the relationship between the school days in a week missed per
student due to school closure in the state on the horizontal axis and log of new unemployment insurance claims that week per 1,000 workers on
the vertical axis. We report data for March 7-14 in orange, March 15-21 in green and March 22-28 in black. Solid lines show fitted estimates from a
regression that includes a dummy variable for the week of March 15-21, a separate dummy variable for the week of March 22-28, per capita
COVID-19 cases in each week, and the share of school days lost (Table 2 Model (8)). State labels are sized in proportion to their 2019 population.
The shaded area corresponds to the 95% confidence interval calculated from standard errors clustered at the state level.

Figure S.1

Panel A shows the relationship between the weekly per capita COVID-19 cases in each state on the horizontal axis and log of new unemployment
insurance claims that week per 1,000 workers on the vertical axis. Panel B shows the relationship between the school days in a week missed per
student due to school closure in the state on the horizontal axis and log of new unemployment insurance claims that week per 1,000 workers on
the vertical axis. We report data for March 7-14 in orange, March 15-21 in green and March 22-28 in black. Solid lines show fitted estimates from a
regression that includes a dummy variable for the week of March 15-21, a separate dummy variable for the week of March 22-28, per capita
COVID-19 cases in each week, and the share of school days lost (Table S.1 Model (8)). State labels are sized in proportion to their 2019
population. The shaded area corresponds to the 95% confidence interval calculated from standard errors clustered at the state level.

The Residuals Unemployment Claims column indicates the deviation of observed unemployment
insurance claims from the claims predicted in Column 8 of Table 2 for March 28th. States with positive
residuals have higher claims than are predicted by the model. States with negative residuals have lower
unemployment claims than predicted by the model.
