    "abstract": "\n\nEvidence from laboratory experiments suggests that important disparities exist between willingness to pay (WTP) and compensation demanded for the same good.  This study advances, and experimentally tests, a new explanation of the WTP/WTA disparity--a dynamic theory based on the presence of commitment costs.  We find that the commitment cost theory combined with a simple behavioral anomaly is able to lend insights into the causes and severity of the WTA/WTP disparity.  Further, we find that market experience attenuates the behavioral anomaly, consistent with the notion that no value disparity exists for agents with sufficient market experience.\n\n",
