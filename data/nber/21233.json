    "abstract": "\n\nThe economics of stratified medicine depend critically on setting the cut-off score of the companion diagnostic (CDx).  This action integrates scientific, clinical, ethical and commercial considerations, and simultaneously determines the value of the stratified medicine to developers, providers, payers and patient.  Setting a high cut-off ensures a larger response by excluding more non-responders but also denies treatment to patients who would respond.  This creates ethical and clinical concerns, and limits market size.  Setting a low cut-off includes more patients who can benefit but includes more non-responders with commensurate costs, side effects and lost time.  CDx\u2019s capture little value under current reimbursement and exclusivity protections.  Combined with low CDx investment incentives for generic drug manufacturers, little CDx development occurs for older legacy drugs.  Therefore payers face an asymmetric situation of novel stratified medicines raising public health and payers\u2019 costs, but no CDx\u2019s for legacy treatments to reduce costs.  It would be in payers\u2019 interests to rediscover their heritage of direct investment in diagnostic development.\n\n",
