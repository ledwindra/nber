GROSS JOB CREATION, GROSS JOB DESTRUCTION
AND EMPLOYMENT REALLOCATION

ABSTRACT

This study measures the heterogeneity of establishment-level
employment changes in the U.S. manufacturing sector over the 1972
to 1986 period.

We measure this heterogeneity in terms of the

gross creation and destruction of jobs and the rate at which jobs
are reallocated across plants.

Our measurement efforts enable us

to quantify the connection between job reallocation and worker
reallocation, to evaluate theories of heterogeneity in
plant-level employment dynamics, and to establish new results
related to the cyclical behavior of the labor market.
