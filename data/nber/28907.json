    "abstract": "\n\nBefore the 2008 crisis, the cross-sectional skewness of banks\u2019 leverage went up and macro risk concentrated in the balance sheets of large banks. Using a model of pro\ufb01t-maximizing banks with heterogeneous Value-at-Risk constraints, we extract the distribution of banks\u2019 risk-taking parameters from balance sheet data. The time series of these estimates allow us to understand systemic risk and its concentration in the banking sector over time. Counterfactual exercises show that (1) monetary policymakers confront the trade-o\ufb00 between stimulating the economy and \ufb01nancial stability, and (2) macroprudential policies can be e\ufb00ective tools to increase \ufb01nancial stability.\n\n",
