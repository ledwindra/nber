Bigger Than You Thought: China's Contribution to Scientific Publications

ABSTRACT
From 2000 to 2016 China increased its scientific publications in the international journals
indexed by Scopus to become the largest contributor to global science, accounting for about 23%
of journal articles adjusted for the Chinese share of addresses or names on publications.
Publications with all-China addresses contributed the most to the increase, followed by crosscountry collaborations and papers by Chinese-named researchers outside the country. The same
period also saw a huge increase in scientific publications in Chinese language journals not
indexed in Scopus. We estimate that while Chinese language papers gain about 1/5th as many
citations as non-Chinese (largely English) papers in Scopus they are so numerous that even
valued as making 1/5th the contribution of a Scopus paper, China accounts for 36% of global
scientific papers defined as Scopus papers and China language equivalent papers and for 37% of
citations to those papers. China's move to the forefront of scientific inquiry makes it a key driver
of the direction of scientific and technological progress and of the knowledge-based economies of
the foreseeable future.

From 2000 to 2016, China jumped from bit player to major contributor of articles in
international scientific journals in physical sciences, engineering and mathematics. Measured by
fractionated addresses indexed by the Scopus bibliometric database, China's share of articles
jumped from 4% of those published in 2000 to 18.6% of those published in 2016, topping the
US's total. 1 But this does not capture the true magnitude of China's contribution to science. The
widely used address metric substantially understates China's rise in prominence by giving China
no credit for papers written by Chinese researchers outside the country and published with nonChinese addresses. And the Scopus database excludes the vast bulk of papers published in
Chinese language journals, which while less impactful than papers in international journals,
contribute new knowledge and its dissemination to the large population of Chinese researchers.
Taking account of these contributions and adjusting Chinese language papers to “Scopus
equivalence”, we estimate that China was responsible for about 36% of 2016 scientific
publications and for 37% of citations of 2013 publications 2 – roughly twice China's share of the
world population or world GDP.
This article presents the statistics for these claims.

Section one describes how we

measure country contributions to papers in international science journals. Section two examines
the growth of articles in Chinese language scientific journals not indexed by Scopus and
develops an exchange rate between Chinese language articles in those journals and non-Chinese
language articles in Scopus to measure China's impact on global science writ large.
1. Measuring national contributions to science publications
The standard measure of a country's contribution to scientific publications credits the
country with papers having its single-country address and gives it partial credit for cross country
collaborations proportionate to the number of country addresses on the paper,allotting 1/2 credit
on multi-country addressed papers to a country with half of the addresses; 1/3rd to a country with
one-third of addresses and so on. Splitting credit among countries proportionate to number of
addresses potentially understates the contribution of countries with multiple researchers working
at a single address compared to those with one researcher per address. To deal with this, we
credit a country on a cross-country paper by the ratio of the number of authors with that country's
address to total authors. Given the large number of Chinese researchers, this raises China's
1

Measured in the Scopus data-base of scientific publications https://www.scopus.com. Reported by National
Science Board (2018), Appendix table 5-27 shows China share exceeded 17.8% for US addresses.
2 We use 2013 as the latest year for citation counts to allow for 3 years' citations through 2016.

3
estimated contribution modestly.
The big weakness of the address metric is not, however, that it ignores the number of
authors at particular country addresses but that it gives no credit to a country for the work of its
researchers published at non-country addresses. It counts a paper with, say, five Chinese named
authors working in the US as a US paper just as it would a paper with five authors having
American names. Indicative of the size of the missing contribution, we estimate that 17% of nonChina addressed articles in 2016 had at least one Chinese named author. 3
Our analysis uses the following formula to divide country credit for a paper with N
authors at A addresses by national background as well as by their address:
(1) Country C contribution of paper i = α(Ac/A) + (1-α) (Nc/N),
where Ac authors have addresses from C (China in our case), 4 and Nc authors have names
associated with that country (i.e. Chinese names); and where α is the weight given to addresses
vs names, varying from 1 (only addresses matter) to 0 (only names matter). A paper based on
research at a unique facility, say the CERN Hadron Collider, would presumably deserve a higher
α than a paper by theorists collaborating over the Internet. For simplicity, we give equal weight
to addresses and names. Because China's share of addresses and names increased substantially,
the choice of α only modestly affect our measures of China's growing contribution to science
(Supplementary Material, Appendix A).
Figure 1 displays our estimates of the weighted fractional contribution of China to
Scopus papers in academic journals based on authors' address and name. 5 We attribute 23.3% of
the papers published in 2016 to China, which is 5.3 points higher than the 18.0% given by the
standard country weighted address measure of contribution. The figure differentiates three types
of Chinese papers: those with China-only addresses; international collaborations with China and
non-China addresses; and papers with Chinese-named authors but no China addresses. The
largest increase in China's share came from the all-China address papers, which rose from 4.04%

3

Estimated from 20,000 randomly chosen articles in the 2016 Scopus, with persons from mainland or other Chinese
speaking areas differentiated from Chinese born outside elsewhere by their first name (Wei is Chinese; James is not)
as well as by second name.
4
We treat authors with multiple institutional addresses in different countries by dividing their contribution to
addresses proportionately to the number of addresses by country. If one author on a 2-author article listed one
institution in country C and another in country D, we credit those countries with 1/4th from that author.
5
Our counts are for journal articles only and thus differ from counts in NSB's Science and Engineering Indicators
2018, which cover publications beyond journals.

4
of all papers in 2000 to 17.87% of all papers in 2016. 6 The proportion of international
collaborations went from 0.38% of papers in 2000 to 2.82% in 2016 while the share of papers
having Chinese names with no Chinese addresses went up from 2.94% to 5.28%.
Taking the entire 2000-2016 period, China added approximately 2.2 million non-Chinese
language papers (weighted by the Chinese share of addresses or names) to the stock of nonChinese language papers and 1.1 million papers in Chinese language journals indexed in Scopus.
Figure 2 shows China's increased role in the scientific literature from a different
perspective – in terms of the proportion of papers with any association to China. The association
measure is 1 if a paper has at least one Chinese address or Chinese named author and 0
otherwise. The association measure exceeds a country's weighted proportion of articles to the
extent that researchers collaborate widely outside their country or group. China was associated
with 12.4% of papers published in 2000 and 34.5% of papers published in 2016.
All told, Figures 1 and 2 show that China's representation in international scientific
journals increased massively in the early 21st century – at rates beyond what knowledgeable
experts seemingly viewed as possible as recently as 2011. 7
Contribution measured by citations
To the extent that researchers pay less attention to papers with Chinese addresses or
names than to other papers, the numbers in Figures 1 and 2 exaggerate the increased Chinese
contribution to science. The standard measure of the attention given to a paper is the number of
citations it receives, which varies for reasons of citation homophily – the tendency for
researchers to disproportionately cite researchers with characteristics like themselves; for its
“intrinsic quality”, and for the citation practices and trajectory of publications in its field.
To measure China's contribution in citations, we counted citations made by all Scopus
publications to journal articles published in 2000 and 2013, using a three-year window every
year from 2000 to 2013. We estimate the number of citations to papers with China
addresses/names relative to all papers and the share of world citations received by those papers.

6

The 2004-2005 expanded Scopus coverage of Chinese language journals contributed to this, but the vast bulk is
through increased publications in non-Chinese language journals. The number of China address published in a nonChinese language journal increased by 539.2% from 2000 to 2016 compared to a 158.4% increase in Chinese
language journals. In 2000 39.1% of China addressed articles were in the Chinese language.
7
May (1996) placed China between Denmark and Switzerland in publications; Zhou and Leydesdorff (2006) noted
China's advance to between France and Germany. Kumar and Asheulova (2011) projected that China would have
substantially fewer publications in Scopus than the US through 2025.

5
Panel A of Figure 3 shows the ratio of average number of citations to Chinese papers to
the global average of citations. In 2000 papers with all-Chinese addresses received just 29% of
the world average of citations, implying that those papers had little impact on research
worldwide.

By contrast, papers by Chinese researchers working outside the country or

collaborating with researchers overseas received citations above world average. Weighted by the
distribution of papers among the groups, Chinese researchers received about the global average
in citations. The data show a different picture in 2013. Citations to papers with all-China
addresses increased to 70% of the global average 8 Citations to international collaborative papers
also increased relative to the global average while citations of papers by Chinese researchers at
non-China addresses converged toward the global mean. The huge increase in the all-China
addressed papers put the average citation of a 2013 Chinese paper below the world average.
Panel B 3 turns to China's share of global citations – the multiplicand of the relative
number of citations and China's share of papers. China's share of global citations rose from 7.4%
in 2000 to 19.5% in 2013, due primarily to the increased share of citations to all China addressed
papers, which signals a shift in the locus of global science to China.
As a final look at China's growing presence in the international scientific literature, we
examined the percentage of Chinese names and Chinese addresses in papers published in Nature
and Science. Figure 4 shows that in 2016 about 20% of names on papers in these journals were
Chinese while 8% to 9% of addresses were Chinese – far above the percentage Chinese of names
or addresses in 2000, with the bigger increase occurring in addresses. 9
In sum, all of our measures of China's contribution to the scientific literature show that
China increased its scientific contribution to levels far above what one might expect from the
country's share of world population or world national production. 10
2. Missing matter: Chinese language papers and citations
The expansion of Chinese publications in primarily English Scopus journals could
8

Xie and Freeman (July 2018) show this reflects both the increased number of Chinese papers, which boosted
citations to Chinese papers due to citation homophily and improved quality reflected in a rising trend of citations to
Chinese papers from papers with no China connection..
9
Bornmann, Leydesdorff, and Wagner (2015) show an increase in BRICS country presence on highly cited papers
and a strong China connection with US; Wang, Wang and Philipsen (2017) describe growing co-authorship between
Chinese based and EU researchers
10
In 2018 China had 18.2% of world population
( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies _by population). In 2017 it had 18.3% of world
GDP in purchasing power parity terms. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)
population.

reasonably be expected to have come at the expense of publications of Chinese language
scientific articles. Historically, the spread of English as the language of science in the 20th
century reduced the number of journals and articles in other languages. 11 To our surprise, this
was not the case for China. The number of Chinese language scientific papers in the
comprehensive China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI)

12

database of journals

published in China shows a growing number of papers in the 2000-2016 period with a level that
reveals a huge “missing matter” invisible science problem 13 (Wagner and Wong, 2012; Van
Leeuwen et al 2001) in using Scopus to assess the level and growth of China's contribution to
global science. In 2007 the CNKI listed 4,216 science, engineering, and math journals as of
2017 14 compared to 329 active Chinese language science journals in Scopus. While Scopus
presumably chose the most outstanding Chinese journals for inclusion, the 92% of Chinese
journals that it did not cover almost certainly had to contain some useful and interesting science.
Figure 5 records the number of CNKI articles in sciences, engineering, and math journals
from 1980 through 2016; the number less the overlap in journals indexed by Scopus; and the
total number of Scopus articles. In the 1980s the number of CNKI articles fell far short of the
number of Scopus articles. China's contribution to science was modest because its low GDP per
capita precluded supporting much scientific work and because the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution
had destroyed the country's university system and curtailed research. In the 1990s China rebuilt
its higher education system sufficiently rapidly to increase the number of articles in the CNKI to
rough parity with the number in Scopus. Thereafter the number of CNKI articles increased more
and then less rapidly than Scopus articles so that in 2016 the two databases published
approximately the same number of articles (1.6 million).
To gain greater insight into the relation between CNKI and Scopus aticles, we compared
the number of Scopus articles with China addresses with CNKI articles in 12 detailed fields15

11

Gordin (2015).
The CNKI includes PhD dissertations, masters' theses, proceedings, newspapers, yearbooks, yearbooks, e-books,
patents, and covers humanities, arts, economics, and business as well as physical sciences, engineering, and
mathematics.
13
We randomly sampled 10,000 CNKI Chinese language articles published in 2016 and found all articles had at
least one China addresses and 9,957 articles had only Chinese names.
14
In addition, the CNKI reports 191 non-Chinese language journals published in China, largely in English. In 2016,
95.67% of CNKI scientific journals were in Chinese, 4.06 % are in English, and 0.27% in other languages.
15 Because CNKI definitions of fields are closer to those in the Web of Science than to field definitions in Scopus,
this analysis used journal articles from Web of Science (which has a similar English language journal coverage to
Scopus).
12

7
and in universities of different status. CNKI Publications fell in mathematics, optics, metallurgy,
and instrumentation; held steady in microbiology, and increased in seven fields such as oncology
and pediatrics (Supplementary Material, Appendix B). Among universities, researchers at the
highest quality “985” universities reduced their CNKI publications while increasing their English
language papers; but the growing number of researchers in less prestigious universities
maintained or increased CNKI publications, possibly filling space when top researchers shifted
to international journals, while also publishing in English language journals (Supplementary
Material, Appendix C). Some scientists may also have published similar articles in English to
reach global researchers in the global community and in Chinese to spread findings to potential
users in China – for instance, biomedical researchers informing Chinese doctors about findings
relevant to medical practices.
The underlying reason for China's concordant increase in publications in international
Scopus journals and CNKI journals appears, however, to be the huge increase in the number of
researchers seeking publication of research findings fueled by the country's massive investment
in R&D, in university faculty, and in industrial researchers. Between 2000 and 2016 China
increased its R&D spending tenfold in constant purchasing power parity terms to exceed EU
spending and approach that in the US. 16 Over the same period China more than doubled its
number of faculty and tripled its number of researchers – all of whom had to find venues for
publishing. 17
Quality and impact
If the scientific content/impact of Chinese language papers was on a par with that of
English language papers, the roughly equal number of CNKI and Scopus articles published in
2016 would imply that China was responsible for about 2/3rds of scientific work (½ from CNKI
journals and ~ 1/3 of the ½ from Scopus) in that year! But CNKI articles do not have the same
quality/impact as international journal articles. Fewer scientists read Chinese than English. 18

16

The 2000 to 2016 growth figures are from https://data.oecd.org/rd/gross-domestic-spending-on-r-d.htm, measured
in US dollars in constant prices using 2010 base year and Purchasing Power Parities. The NSB’s Science and
Engineering Indicators 2018, Table 4-5 shows that in 2015 China exceeded the EU in purchasing power parity
dollars spent on R&D and was sufficiently close to US spending to likely exceed that by 2020, at the latest.
17
The China Statistical Yearbook shows a 146.2% increase in number of faculty from 2000 to 2014 and a 302.5%
increase in the number of researchers. (The China Statistical Yearbook 2001-2015, Table 20-22 and Table 18
respectively). Xie, Zhang and Lai (2014) document China's expansion in higher education and researchers.
18
Fung (2008) describes issues of English authors/journal citation of Chinese language articles. Panko (2017) notes
problems with having a single dominant scientific language.

8
CNKI papers are shorter and have fewer references than Scopus papers and thus presumably
encapsulate less knowledge. 19 China's requirement that PhD's and master's candidates publish
parts of their thesis to obtain a degree leads to many publications with a narrow scope that would
place them in university libraries rather than scientific journals elsewhere. Indicative of the
quality difference, 44.6% of CNKI papers published in 2013 received no citations compared to
29.0% of Scopus papers published in 2013. 20 Recognizing the higher impact/quality of English
language publications, Chinese universities offer sizable monetary and promotion incentives for
publishing in those journals, 21 which induces many researchers to send their best work overseas.
Stipulating that CNKI publications have lower quality/impact than Scopus publications,
the key issue in aggregating the numbers of articles in the data sets relates to their exchange rate:
How valuable is a CNKI article relative to a Scopus article in contributing to science?
We answer this question by examining citations within the Scopus and CNKI databases
and between them. Both Scopus and the CNKI count citations within their own database. In 2013
a Scopus journal article averaged 9.2 forward citations from other Scopus articles while a CNKI
journal article averaged 2.3 forward citations from other CNKI articles. 22 This suggests a
citation-based exchange rate of about 0.25 (= 2.3/9.2) for CNKI articles compared to Scopus
articles.
As neither database counts citations from the other, we estimated cross-database citations
from the referencesvto articles published in 2013 in random samples of non-Chinese language
Scopus papers and of Chinese language papers in CNKI. 23 Our calculations revealed a huge
imbalance in citation flows. CNKI articles cited many articles in Scopus while Scopus articles
cited few CNKI articles. We estimate that about half of journal references in CNKI articles to
articles published in 2013 were to Scopus articles, while just 0.29% of journal references in
19

We documented the samples of 2,000 randomly selected CNKI journal articles and found nine references per
article compared to 42 references per article in Scopus. To the extent that articles with fewer references rely on less
information and cover less material than articles with a greater number of references, a CNKI article has less
scientific value than Scopus article, possibly by the 9/42 ratio references and thus to be about 21% as informative.
20
These estimates based on all journal articles in Scopus and the CNKI from August 2017 to November 2017
21 Quan, Chen and Shu (2017).
22
The distribution of citations in both data sets follow power laws with most papers receiving few citations while a
few gain lots, with Scopus papers have a heavier tail than CNKI papers. Correlatingcitations from Scopus and from
CNKI in the overlap Chinese language journals covered by both we found a significant positive correlation.
23
We randomly sampled 10,000 non-Chinese language articles in Scopus from 2013 to 2017 and found 19,859
references to journal articles published in 2013. We randomly sampled 2,000 Scopus non-Chinese language articles
from 2013 to 2017 to obtain their references and randomly sampled 500 articles from CNKI Chinese language
articles to obtain their references . Supplementary Materials, Appendix D gives the details of our estimation

9
Scopus articles to 2013 published articles were to Chinese language journals in the CNKI and
not in Scopus. (Supplementary Materials: Appendix D). Extrapolating these estimates to all 2013
articles we estimate that 2013 Scopus articles received 3,276,350 citations from CNKI articles in
the following three years whereas 2013 CNKI articles received l32,196 citations from nonChinese language Scopus articles. Adding these citations to the number of citations in Scopus
and CNKI reduces the exchange rate of a CNKI journal article from 0.25 to 0.20 of a Scopus
paper.
Figure 6 shows that with this adjustment, China contributed 36% of Scopus equivalent
“global science” articles based on fraction weighted names and addresses and gained 37% of
Scopus equivalent citations while having an association with 45% of Scopus equivalent articles.
As our calculations ignore scientific articles outside Scopus in languages other than Chinese, this
over-estimates China's share of “global publications”. But because Scopus includes many nonEnglish non-Chinese journals (14% of Scopus journals are in non-English non-Chinese journals)
and because no country comes close to China in its scale of science, such adjustments will not
substantively alter our finding that China's expansion in science is “bigger than you thought”.
3. Conclusion
That China, one of the lowest income countries in the world at the turn of the 21st century,
became a super-power in scientific knowledge in less than two decades is a remarkable
development in the history of science. The way China deploys its newly developed scientific
resources will help drive the direction of science and technology into the foreseeable future; and
given the role of scientific and engineering knowledge in modern economies and society, give
the country a huge role in developing the global knowledge-based economy. To paraphrase
Horace Greeley's advice to Americans as the US expanded to California “Go West, young man,
and grow up with the country," 24 barring some huge massive change, science is going East and
will grow up with China.

Note: Based on estimated Scopus equivalence of CNKI articles as ratio of average citations of CNKI articles/average citations of Scopus
articles = 0.20 in our calculations.
Share of articles associated with China = (# China associated articles in Scopus + 0.20 * # CNKI only Chinese articles) /(# articles in
Scopus + 0.20 * # CNKI only Chinese articles).
Share of weighted articles of China = (# weighted Scopus articles of China + 0.20 * # weighted CNKI only Chinese articles)/ /(#
articles in Scopus + 0.20 * # CNKI only Chinese articles).
Share of citations = (citations on Scopus paper weighted by China names/addresses + weighted citations of China from CNKI
only Chinese articles to Scopus non‐Chinese language articles + total CNKI citations from Scopus and CNKI )/total global citation)

Source: We estimated the number of references that Scopus non-Chinese language articles give to Chinese language journals in
CNKI but not in Scopus in 2013 by sampling 10,000 articles from 2013 to 2017 (2,000 per year) and counted the number of
journal articles that referenced articles published in 2013. We found 19,859 journal references, nearly all (19,731) to Scopus
journals and 64 to Scopus Chinese journals. We selected references with a journal title from the remaining references and
matched journal titles with CNKI journals and found 58 references.
We estimated the number of references from CNKI Chinese language articles to Scopus non-Chinese language articles
in 2013 by randomly sampling 500 articles from 2013 to 2017 (100 yearly) and found references to 2,984 documents -- 1,031 of
which are Chinese language journal articles and 1,848 to non-Chinese language documents. Of these 533 had the mark [J] that
CNKI uses to identify journals. But we also found 534 articles that we identified as in journals, giving us a total of 1,067
references to non-Chinese journals. Thus we estimate that 50.87% (= 1067/(1067+1031)) of CNKI references were to nonChinese journals nearly all in Scopus. A similar analysis of Chinese language papers in Scopus journals gave an estimate of 49.7%
of journal citations to non-Chinese Scopus articles. The weighted Chinese address/authors' contribution to the 1067 CNKI
references was 37.84% – nearly double China’s 19.46% share of total citations, reflecting homophily in references.
