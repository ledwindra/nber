    "abstract": "\n\nWhile it is usually argued that direct and indirect taxes should be added for meaningful international comparisons of country competitiveness, this paper argues that the opposite may be true. It is possible that a country with a high value-added tax needs a high capital income tax to maintain its international competitiveness and vice verca. Which view is correct depends on which combination of the origin, destination, source and residence principles' prevail and whether or not accelerated depreciation is allowed. Using a Heckscher-Ohlin model with international capital movements the paper studies the relevant alternatives in detail.\n\n",
