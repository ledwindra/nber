ABSTRACT
We introduce a simple adverse selection problem arising in credit markets into a standard
textbook real business cycle model. There is a continuum of households and a continuum of
anonymous producers who produce the final goods from intermediate goods. These producers do
not have the resources to make up-front payments to purchase inputs and must do so by
borrowing from competitive financial intermediates. However, lending to these producers is
risky: honest borrowers will always pay off their debt, but dishonest borrowers will always
default. This gives rise to an adverse selection problem for financial intermediaries. In a
continuous-time real business cycle setting we show that such adverse selection generates
multiple steady states and both local and global indeterminacy, and can give rise to equilibria
with probabilistic jumps in credit, consumption, investment and employment driven by Markov
sunspots under calibrated parameterizations and fully rational expectations. Introducing
reputational effects eliminates defaults and results in a unique but still indeterminate steady state.
Finally we generalize the model to firms with heterogeneous and stochastic productivity, and
show that indeterminacies and sunspots persist.

Introduction

The seminal work of Wilson (1980) shows that in a static model, adverse selection can generate
multiple equilibria because of asymmetric information about product quality. The aim of this
paper is to analyze how adverse selection in credit markets can give rise to lending externalities
that generate multiple steady states and a continuum of equilibria in an otherwise standard
dynamic general equilibrium model of business cycles.
In particular, we introduce a simple type of adverse selection arising in credit markets into
a standard textbook real business cycle (RBC) model. The model features a continuum of
households and a continuum of anonymous producers. These producers use intermediate goods
to produce the final goods. But because they do not have the resources to make up-front
payments to purchase intermediate inputs, to finance their working capital they must borrow
from competitive financial intermediaries. Lending to these producers however is risky, as some
borrowers may default. We assume that there are two types of borrowers (producers). In our
baseline model, honest borrowers will always pay back their loans, while dishonest borrowers will
always default. The financial intermediaries do not know which borrower is honest and which
is not. This gives rise to adverse selection: for any given interest rate, dishonest borrowers have
a stronger incentive to borrow. In such an environment, an increase in lending from optimistic
financial intermediaries encourages more honest producers to borrow. The increased quality
of borrowers reduces the default risk, which in turn motivates other financial intermediaries
to lend. The resulting decline in the interest rate brings down the production cost for all
producers/borrowers. This drives output expansion, further increases the credit supply from
households, and generates more future lending. In other words, a lending externality exists
both intratemporally and intertemporally.
In our baseline model in section 2, we study the local dynamics of our model to show that
this lending externality not only generates two steady state equilibria with low and high average
default rates, but also gives rise to a continuum of equilibria around one of the steady states
under calibrated parameterizations. We then move on to characterize the global dynamics of
our model economy. The additional insight from the global dynamics analysis is that even in
the absence of local indeterminacy we may still have global indeterminacy, with boom and bust
cycles in output under rational expectations. Our adverse selection model can exhibit jumps
across equilibria so that credit, consumption, investment and employment can suddenly collapse
with some probability, driven by a Markov sunspot or a confidence crisis. We construct our

1

model such that agents expect such probabilistic jumps and thus build them into their optimal
decisions. Jump probabilities can then capture occasional confidence and credit crises, or boom
and bust cycles, as we demonstrate in section 2.6.
In a dynamic setting where producers who borrow are not completely anonymous, market
forces and competition can mitigate adverse selection through reputational effects absent from
our baseline model in section 2. Therefore in section 3, we examine whether indeterminacy
survives under reputational effects. We follow Kehoe and Levine (1993) and assume that a
borrower who defaults may lose reputation with some probability, and is then excluded from
the credit market forever. In the model with reputational effects, we show that the steady state
equilibrium is unique and no default occurs in equilibrium. Nevertheless, indeterminacy in the
form of a continuum of equilibria persists.
We then extend our model in section 4 to incorporate a continuum of types of producers.
Producers face different risks in their production. Adverse selection arises as the riskier firms
have stronger incentives to borrow under limited liability. We show that for the given total
inputs at any moment in time, the static equilibrium is unique.1 In contrast to the static
asymmetric information model (Wilson (1980)), the dynamic nature of our model is crucial:
multiple equilibria would be impossible without dynamic capital accumulation in our setting.
As a by-product, our model also provides a microfoundation for the aggregate increasing returns
to scale.
It is well known that in a static setting, market structure is important for the existence of
multiple equilibria. In section 5 we extend our analysis to the case with monopoly banking,
which rules out multiple equilibria in a static setting. This is because in this case the monopolist
bank optimally chooses the gross interest rate, which then determines the static equilibrium.
We show however that dynamic indeterminacy still arises in such an environment.
Our model has several implications that are supported by empirical evidence. First, a large
literature has documented that credit risk is countercyclical and has far-reaching macroeconomic consequences. For instance, Gilchrist and Zakrajšek (2012) find that shocks to credit
risks lead to significant declines in consumption, investment, and output. Pintus, Wen and Xing
(2015) show that interest rates faced by US firms move countercyclically and lead the business
cycle. These facts are consistent with our model predictions. Second, our model delivers a
countercyclical markup, an important empirical regularity well documented in the literature.

We intentionally focus on the interior solution by ruling out the uninteresting complete market collapse
equilibrium.

2

Because of information asymmetry, dishonest borrowers enjoy an information rent. However,
when the average quality of borrowers increases due to higher lending, this information rent is
diluted. Hence the measured markup declines, which is critical to sustaining indeterminacy by
bringing about higher real wages, a positive labor supply response, and a higher output that
dominates the income effect on leisure. Third, our extended model in section 4 can explain the
well-known procyclical variation in productivity. The procyclicality of average quality in the
credit market implies that resources are reallocated towards producers with lower credit risk
when aggregate output increases. The improved resource allocation then raises productivity
endogenously. The procyclical endogenous TFP immediately implies that increases in inputs
will lead to a more than proportional increase in total aggregate output, mimicking aggregate
increasing returns. This effective increasing returns to scale arise only at the aggregate level.
It is also consistent with the results of Basu and Fernald (1997), who find slightly decreasing
returns to scale for typical two-digit industries in the US, but strong increasing returns to scale
at the aggregate level. Adverse selection in credit markets then becomes realistic, in rich as
well as developing countries.2
Related Literature Our paper is closely related to several branches of literature in macroeconomics. First, our paper builds on a large strand of literature on the possibility of indeterminacy in RBC models. Benhabib and Farmer (1994) point out that increasing returns to
scale can generate indeterminacy in an RBC model. The degree of increasing returns to scale
in production required to generate indeterminacy, however, is considered to be too large (See
Basu and Fernald (1995, 1997)). Subsequent work in the literature has introduced additional
features to the Benhabib-Farmer model that reduce the degree of increasing returns required
for indeterminacy. In an important contribution, Wen (1998) adds variable capacity utilization
and shows that indeterminacy can arise from a magnitude of increasing returns similar to that
in the data. Gali (1994) and Jaimovich (2007) explore the possibility of indeterminacy via
countercyclical markups due to output composition and firm entry respectively. The literature
has also shown that models with indeterminacy can replicate many of the standard business
cycle moments in the standard RBC models (see Farmer and Guo (1994)). Furthermore, indeterminacy models may outperform the standard RBC models in many other dimensions. For
instance, Benhabib and Wen (2004), Wang and Wen (2008), and Benhabib and Wang (2014)
show that models with indeterminacy can explain the hump-shaped output dynamics and the

field experiments in South Africa.

relative volatility of labor and output, which are challenging for the standard RBC models.
Our paper complements this strand of literature by adding adverse selection as an additional
source of macroeconomic indeterminacy. The adverse selection approach also provides a microfoundation for increasing returns to scale at the aggregate level. Indeed, once we specify
a Pareto distribution for firm productivity, our model in section 4 is isomorphic to those that
have a representative-firm economy with increasing returns. It therefore inherits the ability
to reproduce the business cycle features mentioned above without having to rely on increasing
returns.3
Second, our paper is closely related to a burgeoning literature studying the macroeconomic
consequences of adverse selection. Kurlat (2013) builds a dynamic general equilibrium model
with adverse selection in the second-hand market for capital assets. Kurlat (2013) shows that
the degree of adverse selection varies countercyclically. Since adverse selection reduces the
efficiency of resource allocation, a negative shock that lowers aggregate output will negatively
affect both adverse selection and resource allocation efficiency. Hence the impact of the initial
shocks on aggregate output is propagated over time. Like Kurlat (2013), Bigio (2015) develops
an RBC model with adverse selection in the capital market. As firms must sell their existing
capital to finance investment and employment, adverse selection distorts both capital and labor
markets. Bigio shows that the adverse selection shock widens the dispersion of capital quality,
exacerbates the distortion of markets, and creates a recession with a quantitative pattern similar
to that observed during the Great Recession of 2008. Our model generates similar predictions
to Kurlat (2013) and Bigio (2015). First, adverse selection is also countercyclical in our model,
and therefore the propagation of fundamental shocks via adverse selection, as highlighted by
Kurlat (2013), is also present in our model. Second, in our model adverse selection in the
credit markets naturally causes both capital and labor inputs to be distorted. Introducing
stochastic and heterogeneous productivities into our extended model in section 4 aggravates
adverse selection and makes the economy more vulnerable to self-fulfilling expectation-driven
fluctuations. While Kurlat (2013) and Bigio (2015) emphasize the role of adverse selection in
propagating business cycle shocks, our paper complements their work by showing that adverse
selection generates multiple steady states and indeterminacy, and hence can be a source of large
business cycle fluctuations driven by self-fulfilling expectations.4 One of the main differences
3

Liu and Wang (2014) provide an alternative mechanism to generate increasing returns via financial constraints.
4
Many other papers have also addressed adverse selection in a dynamic environment. Examples include
Williamson and Wright (1994), Eisfeldt (2004), House (2006), Guerrieri, Shimer, and Wright (2010), Chiu and

4

between our model and these two studies is the source of asymmetric information. Kurlat
(2013) and Bigio (2015) both focus on asymmetric information about the quality of physical
capital. Kurlat (2013) assumes an inelastic labor supply and hand-to-mouth workers. In this
setup adverse selection does not change the labor input and thus dynamic indeterminacy is not
possible. Optimistic beliefs or expectations of higher output cannot be self-fulfilling, as output
is pre-determined by capital stock. In Bigio (2015), adverse selection also produces a wedge
between labor productivity and real wage, as in our model. Bigio also assumes workers do not
have access to financial markets and therefore consume all their income. Although labor supply
is endogenous in Bigio (2015), it depends only on real wage and exhibits no income effect (as in
the case of GHH preferences by Greenwood, Hercowitz and Huffman (1988)). As demonstrated
by Jaimovich (2008), dynamic indeterminacy is not possible when there are no income effects
on the supply of labor, even under increasing returns and externalities. In our paper, adverse
selection creates a distortion in both labor and in output. Optimistic beliefs about output
increases the real wage, either through a countercyclical markup as in our baseline model,
or through the procyclical productivity channel described in section 4.5 Under the standard
household preferences that we use, both labor and output can increase sufficiently, confirming
the initial optimistic belief about higher output.
All of the above papers focus on local dynamics via log-linearization. As Brunnermeier
and Sannikov (2014) and He and Krithnamurthy (2012) have cautioned, analyzing the local
dynamics may not yield the same insights about economic fluctuations and crises that analyzing
the global dynamics does. Thus we use a continuous-time setup to characterize both the local
and global dynamics in the presence of information asymmetry. Indeed, a global dynamics
analysis in our model shows that large economic crises can be triggered by confidence shocks
in the credit market, arguably an important feature of the recent 2008 financial crisis.
Finally, our extended model in section 3 with reputational effects is also related to that of
Chari, Shourideh and Zeltin-Jones (2014), who model a secondary loan market with adverse
selection and show how reputational effects can generate persistent adverse selection. Multiple
equilibria also arise in their model as in Spence’s (1973) classic signaling model. In contrast,
multiple equilibria in our reputational model take the form of indeterminacy. They are generated by endogenously countercyclical markups that mimic aggregate increasing returns.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the baseline model, characterizes the conditions for local indeterminacy, and then proceeds to analyze global dynamics.
Section 3 incorporates reputational effects into the baseline model and shows that indeterminacy may still arise, even without defaults in equilibrium. In section 4 we introduce a continuous
distribution of heterogeneous and stochastic firm productivity, and show that adverse selection
in that model can induce endogenous TFP, amplification, aggregate increasing returns to scale
and a continuum of equilibria. In section 5 we conduct an additional robustness analysis. In
particular we extend our model to endogenize the size of project, or output, that each firm can
undertake. This weakens the lending externality because additional lending may be allocated
to the riskier borrowers that can, at some cost, adjust the size of their project. Nevertheless
we show that our results are robust to such an extension. Section 6 concludes.

The Baseline Model

Time is continuous and proceeds from zero to infinity. There is an infinitely-lived representative
household and a continuum of final goods producers. The final goods producers purchase
intermediate goods as input to produce the final good, which is then sold to households for
consumption and investment. The intermediate goods are produced with capital and labor in
a competitive market. We assume no distortion in the production of intermediate goods. Final
goods firms do not have resources to make up-front payments to purchase intermediate goods
before production takes place and revenues from sales are realized. They must therefore borrow
from competitive financial intermediaries (lenders) to finance their working capital. Lending
to these final goods producers is risky however, as they may default. We assume that there are
two types of producers (borrowers): honest borrowers who have the ability to produce and will
always pay back the loan after the production, and dishonest borrowers who will always default
on their loan. The lenders do not know which borrower is which. They make loans to firms fully
aware of the adverse selection problem. We begin by assuming that all trade is anonymous by
excluding the possibility of reputational effects. We relax these strong assumptions in section
3, where we introduce reputational effects.

where ρ > 0 is the subjective discount factor, Ct is the consumption, Nt is the hours worked,
ψ > 0 is the utility weight for labor, and γ ≥ 0 is the inverse Frisch elasticity of labor supply.
The household faces the following budget constraint:
Ct + It ≤ Rt ut Kt + Wt Nt + Πt ,

(2)

where Rt , Wt and Πt denote respectively the rental price, wage and total profits from all
firms and financial intermediaries. As in Wen (1998) we introduce an endogenous capacity
utilization rate ut . As is standard in the literature, the depreciation rate of capital increases
with the capacity utilization rate according to
δ(ut ) = δ 0

where δ 0 > 0 is a constant and θ > 0.6 Finally, the law of motion for capital is governed by
K̇t = −δ(ut )Kt + It .

The households choose a path of consumption Xt , Ct , Nt , ut , and Kt to maximize their
utility function (1), taking Rt , Wt and Πt as given. The first-order conditions are

and

The left-hand side of equation (5) is the marginal utility of consumption obtained from an
additional unit of work, and the right-hand side is the marginal disutility of a unit of work.
Equation (6) is the usual Euler equation. Finally, a one-percent increase in the utilization rate

depreciation function.

raises the total rent by Rt Kt but also increases total depreciation by δ0 uθt Kt . Equation (7)
thus states that the marginal benefit is equal to the marginal cost of utilization. Finally the
transversality condition is given by limt→∞ e−ρt C1t Kt = 0.
Final goods producers There is a unit measure of final goods producers indexed by
i ∈ [0, 1]. A fraction π of them are dishonest and a fraction 1 − π are honest. Each one of the
honest producers is endowed with an indivisible project as in Stiglitz and Weiss (1981), which
transforms Φ units of intermediate goods to Φ units of final goods. Let Pt be the price of the
intermediate goods input. Each project then requires ΦPt of working capital. The dishonest
producers, however, can claim to be honest and borrow Pt Φ and then default and keep, for
simplicity, all of the borrowed funds. They thus enjoy a profit of Pt Φ. Anticipating this adverse
selection problem, the final intermediates will therefore charge all borrowers a gross interest
rate Rf t > 1. Hence the profit from borrowing and producing for a honest producer is given
by
Πht = (1 − Rf t Pt ) Φ.
Denote by st the measure of honest producers who invest in their projects:

1−π
if Rf t < P1t

∈ [0, 1 − π) if Rf t = P1t .
st =

0
if Rf t > P1t

(8)

(9)

The total demand for intermediate goods is hence given by
Xt = st Φ.

(10)

Since each firm also produces Φ units of the final goods, the total quantity of final goods
produced is
Yt = st Φ = Xt

(11)

Intermediate goods The intermediate goods are produced with capital and labor using
the technology
Xt = AK̃tα Nt1−α ,

(12)

where K̃t = ut Kt is total capital supply from the households. In a competitive market the
profit of producers is Πxt = Pt AK̃tα Nt1−α − Wt Nt − Rt K̃t . The first-order conditions are

Under competition profits are zero, so Πxt = 0, and Wt Nt + Rt ut Kt = Pt Xt .
Financial Intermediaries The financial intermediaries must compete for business. Anticipating that only a fraction Θt of the loans will be paid back, the interest rate is then given
by
Rf t =

1
.
Θt

(15)

Hence the financial intermediaries earn zero profit. The honest producers altogether borrow
Xt Pt of working capital and the dishonest producers altogether borrow πΦPt of working capital.
Since only the honest producers pay back their loan, the average payback rate is
Θt =

Equilibrium

We focus on an interior solution so Rf t =

1 7
Pt .

In equilibrium, the total profit is simply πPt Φ.

Hence the total budget constraint becomes
Ct + It = Pt Xt + πPt Φ.
Since Pt =

1
Rf t

= Θt =

Xt
πΦ+Xt ,

(17)

the above equation can be further reduced to

Ct + It = Pt Xt + πPt Φ = Xt = Yt .

(18)

We then obtain the resource constraint
Ct + K̇t = Yt − δ(ut )Kt .

(19)

The inverse of markup, using equation (18), is therefore given by
φt ≡ 1 −

Πt
πPt Φ
=1−
= Θt = Pt .
Yt
Xt

As φt = Θt , the inverse of markup also represents the average quality of the borrowers in the
credit market. Finally, the rental price of capital is given by
Rt = φt ·

αYt
.
ut Kt

(20)

We assume, without loss of generality, that Φ is large enough, so Φ > AKtα Nt1−α . We can also assume that
there is free entry and that an infinite measure of potential honest producers exist as potential entrants. The
free entry condition then implies Rf t = P1t .

Finally the aggregate production function becomes
Yt = A (ut Kt )α Nt1−α .

(28)

In short, the equilibrium can be characterized by equations (22), (23), (24), (28), (19) and (27).
These six equations fully determine the dynamics of the six variables Ct , Kt , Yt , ut , Nt and φt .
Equation (27) implies that φt increases with aggregate output. Note that

1
φt

=

Yt
Rt ut Kt +Wt Nt

is the aggregate markup. Therefore the endogenous markup in our model is countercyclical,
which is consistent with the empirical regularity well documented in the literature.8 The credit
spread is given by Rf t − 1 = πΦ/Yt and moves in a countercyclical fashion as in the data.
The countercyclical markup has important implications. For example, it can make the
number of hours worked and the real wage move in the same direction. To see this, suppose
that Nt increases, so that output increases. Then according to equation (27), the marginal
cost φt increases as well, which in turn raises the real wage in equation (21). If the markup
is a constant, then the real wage would be proportional to the marginal product of labor and
8

See, e.g., Bils (1987) and Rotemberg and Woodford (1999).

10

would fall when hours increase. Note also that when π = 0, i.e., there is no adverse selection
in the credit markets, equation (27) implies that φt = 1, and our model simply reduces to a
standard RBC model. The markup is 1/φt > 1 if and only if dishonest firms obtain rent due
to information asymmetry.

2.3

Steady State

We first study the steady state of the model. We use Z to denote the steady state of variable
Zt . To solve the steady state, we first express all other variables in terms of φ and then we
solve for φ as a fixed-point problem. Combining equations (23) and (24) yields

φ
Ψ(φ) is a non-monotonic function of φ since Ψ(0) = 0 and Ψ(1) = 0. On the one hand, if the
average credit quality is 0, the total supply of credit would be zero, and hence no lending would
11

be possible. On the other hand, if the average quality is one, i.e., φ = 1, then by definition no
bad loan would be made. So given Φ̄, there may exist two steady state values of φ. Denote
Ψmax = max0≤φ≤1 Ψ(φ) and φ∗ = arg max0≤φ≤1 Ψ(φ). Then we have the following lemma
regarding the possibility of multiple steady state equilibria.
Lemma 1 When 0 < Φ̄ < Ψmax , there exists two steady states φ that solve Φ̄ = Ψ(φ).
It is well known that adverse selection can generate multiple equilibria in a static model
(see, e.g., Wilson (1980)). Therefore it is not surprising that our model has multiple steady
state equilibria. A credit expansion by financial intermediaries invites more honest firms to
borrow and produce. The increased quality of borrowers reduces the default risk, which then
stimulates more lending from other financial intermediaries. In turn, the interest rate charged
by financial intermediaries decreases, bringing down the production cost. This triggers an
output expansion, and further encourages credit supply from the households, and thus generates more future lending. In a nutshell, a lending externality exists both intratemporally and
intertemporally. We will show that this type of lending externality generates a new type of multiplicity, which shares some similarities with the indeterminacy literature following Benhabib
and Farmer (1994).

2.4

Local Dynamics

A number of studies have explored the role of endogenous markup in generating local indeterminacy and endogenous fluctuations (see, e.g., Jaimovich (2006) and Benhabib and Wang
(2013)). Following the standard practice, we study the local dynamics around the steady state.
Note that at the steady state φ and Φ̄ are linked by Φ̄ = Ψ(φ), so we can parameterize the
steady state either by Φ̄ or φ. We will use φ as it is more convenient for the study of local
dynamics. Denote by x̂t = log Xt − log X the percentage deviation from the steady state. First,
we log-linearize equation (27) to obtain

which suggests that the percentage deviation of the marginal cost is proportional to output.
Log-linearizing equations (28) and (24) yields

We assume that 1 + θ − (1 + τ )α > 0, or equivalently

− 1, to make a > 0 and b > 0. In general these restrictions are easily satisfied (see

section 2.5). We can also substitute out n̂t after log-linearizing equation (22) to express ŷt as

It is worth mentioning that a+b =

the case without adverse selection. Thus endogenous capacity utilization alone does not generate an increasing returns to scale effect at the aggregate level. However, a + b =

1+θ−α
1+θ−(1+τ )α

>1

if τ > 0. That is, through general equilibrium effects, adverse selection combined with endogenous capacity utilization mimics increasing returns to scale, even though production has
constant returns to scale. Furthermore, if τ > θ , then b > 1. The model can then explain
the procyclical movements in labor productivity ŷt − n̂t without resorting to exogenous TFP
shocks.
The effective increasing returns in production can generate locally indeterminate steady
states as in Benhabib and Farmer (1994). If increasing capital can increase the marginal product
of capital, given a fixed discount rate, the relative price of capital must fall and the relative
price of consumption must rise so that the total return including capital gains or losses equals
the discount rate. The increase in the relative price of consumption boosts consumption at the
expense of investment, so capital drifts back towards the steady state instead of progressively
exploding. The steady state then becomes a sink rather than a saddle, and therefore becomes
indeterminate. The mechanism responsible for the increase in the marginal product of capital
however is the increase in the supply of labor in response to higher wages that offset diminishing
returns to capital in production. In a standard context, this is not possible if leisure is a
normal good. In our adverse selection context, however, the countercyclical markups, which
are associated with lower default rates and higher intermediate goods prices that increase with
output levels, allow wages to rise sufficiently. The resulting higher labor supply can then mimic
increasing returns, as the marginal product of capital rises with capital.9
This mechanism can be seen directly from equation (35): a one-percent increase in capital
directly increases output and the marginal product of labor by a percent and, from equation
(34), reduces the markup by aτ percent. Thanks to its higher marginal productivity, the labor
supply also increases. A one-percent increase in labor supply then increases output by b percent.
9
The same mechanism for local indeterminacy can also operate in models of collateral constraints that also
give countercyclical markups as in Benhabib and Wang (2013).

13

The exact increase in labor supply depends on the Frisch elasticity γ. This explains why the
equilibrium output elasticity with respect to capital, λ1 , depends on parameters a and b and
through them on γ and τ . On the household side, since both leisure and consumption are
normal goods, an increase in consumption has a wealth effect on labor supply. The effect of a
change in labor supply on output induced by a change in consumption, as seen from equation
(36) obtained after substituting for labor in equation (35), works through the marginal cost
channel, and also depends on τ . Again since both a and b increase with τ , output elasticities
with respect to capital and consumption are increasing functions of τ . In other words, the
presence of adverse selection makes equilibrium output more sensitive to changes in capital and
to changes in autonomous consumption, and creates an amplification mechanism for business
fluctuations.
Formally, using equation (36) and the log-linearized equations (19) and (23), we can then
characterize the local dynamics as follows:

λ2 ≡ − 1+γ−b(1+τ

local dynamics around the steady state is determined by the roots of J. The model economy
exhibits local indeterminacy if both roots of J are negative. Note that the sum of the roots
equals the trace of J, and the product of the roots equals the determinant of J. Thus the sign
of the roots of J can be observed from the sign of its trace and determinant. The following
lemma specifies the sign of the trace and the determinant for local indeterminacy.
Lemma 2 Denote τmin ≡

(1+θ)(1−α)+α(1+γ)

− 1 and τmax ≡ 1 − φ∗ , then Trace(J) < 0 if and

only if τ > τmin , and Det(J) > 0 if and only if τmin < τ < τmax .
According to Lemma 2, our baseline model is indeterminate if and only if τmin < τ < τmax .
In this case, Trace(J) < 0 and Det(J) > 0 jointly imply that both roots of J are negative. We
summarize this result in the following proposition.
Proposition 1 The model exhibits local indeterminacy around a particular steady state if and
only if
τmin < τ < τmax .
14

(39)

Equivalently, indeterminacy emerges if and only if φ ∈ (φmin , φmax ), where φmin ≡ 1 − τmax =
φ∗ , and φmax ≡ 1 − τmin .
To understand the intuition behind Proposition 1, first note that if τ > τmin , we have
1 + γ − b(1 + τ ) < 1 + γ −

(1 + θ)(1 − α)
(1 + τmin ) = 0.
1 + θ − (1 + τmin )α

(40)

Then the equilibrium elasticity of output with respect to consumption λ2 becomes positive,
namely, an autonomous change in consumption leads to an increase in output. Since capital is
predetermined, labor must increase by equation (35). To induce an increase in labor, the real
wage must increase enough to overcome the income effect, which is only possible if the increase
in markup is large enough. In other words, τ in equation (34) must be large enough.
We have used the mapping between τ and steady state output to characterize the indeterminacy condition in terms of the model’s deep parameter values. Notice that τmax = 1 − φ∗ ,
where φ∗ ≡ arg max0≤φ≤1 Ψ(φ). Since 1 − φ̄L > 1 − φ∗ = τmax , the local dynamics around the
steady state associated with φ = φ̄L are determinate according to Proposition 1. Indeterminacy
is only possible in the neighborhood of the steady state associated with φ = φ̄H . The following
corollary formally characterizes the indeterminacy condition in terms of Φ̄.
Corollary 1 Denote Φ̄ = πΦ.
1. If Φ̄ ∈ (0, Ψ(φmax )), then both steady states are saddles.
2. If Φ̄ ∈ (Ψ(φmax ), Ψmax ), then the local dynamics around the steady state φ = φ̄H exhibits
indeterminacy while the local dynamics around the steady state φ = φ̄L is a saddle.
As suggested by Lemma 1, we focus on the nontrivial region in which Φ̄ < Ψmax . When
Ψ(φmax ) < Φ̄ < Ψmax , we have φmin = φ∗ < φ̄H < φmax , and φ̄L < φmin . As a result, according
to Proposition 1, the steady state φ̄H exhibits indeterminacy. For the steady state φ = φ̄L , by
Lemma 2, we can conclude that the determinant of J is negative. So the two roots of J must
have opposite signs and this implies a saddle. But if 0 < Φ̄ < Ψ(φmax ), we have φ̄H > φmax
and φ̄L < φmin . In this case, the determinants of J at both steady states are negative. So both
steady states are saddles.
We summarize these different scenarios in Figure 1. The inverted U curve illustrates the
relationship between φ and Φ̄ specified in equation (33). In Figure 1, φ is on the horizontal axis
and Φ̄ is on the vertical axis. For a given Φ̄, the two steady states φ̄L and φ̄H can be located
15

from the intersection of the inverted U curve and a horizontal line through point (0, Φ̄). The
two vertical lines passing points (φmin , 0) and (φmax , 0) divide the diagram into three regions.
In the left and right regions, the determinant of the Jacobian matrix J is negative, implying
that one of the roots is positive and the other is negative. Therefore if a steady state φ falls into
either of these two regions, it is a saddle. In the middle region, Det(J) > 0 and Trace(J) < 0,
and thus both roots are negative. Therefore if the steady state φ falls into the middle region it
is a sink, which supports multiple self-fulfilling expectation-driven equilibria, or indeterminacy,
in its neighborhood.
Since Φ̄ = πΦ, we can reinterpret the above corollary in terms of π, the proportion of
dishonest firms. For simplicity, assume Φ is large enough such that Φ > Ψmax . Denote πL ≡
Ψ(φmax )/Φ and πH ≡ Ψ(φmin )/Φ = Ψmax /Φ, and thus 0 < πL < πH < 1. Then we know that
(i) if π ∈ (0, πL ], both steady states are saddles, (ii) if π ∈ (πL , πH ), the steady state with
φ = φ̄L is a saddle while the steady state with φ = φ̄H is a sink, and (iii) if π ∈ [πH , 1], then
no non-degenerate steady state equilibria exist. As indicated in Lemma 1, the third case is
the least interesting, and thus we focus on the scenarios in which π < πH . Then the model is
indeterminate if the adverse selection problem is severe enough, i.e., π > πL . We summarize
the above argument in the following corollary.

Corollary 2 The likelihood of indeterminacy increases with π, the proportion of dishonest
firms.
Arguably, adverse selection is more severe in developing countries. Our study then also
suggests that developing countries are more likely to be subject to self-fulfilling expectationdriven fluctuations and hence exhibit higher economic volatility, which is in line with the
empirical regularity emphasized by Ramey and Ramey (1995) and Easterly, Islam, and Stiglitz
(2000).

2.5

Empirical Possibility of Indeterminacy

We have proved that our model with adverse selection can generate self-fulfilling equilibria in
theory. We now examine the empirical plausibility of self-fulfilling equilibria under calibrated
parameter values. The frequency is a quarter. We set ρ = 0.01, implying an annual risk-free
interest rate of 4%. We set θ = 0.3 so that the depreciation rate at steady state is 0.033 and
the annualized investment-to-capital ratio is 12% (see Cooper and Haltiwanger (2006)). We set

average profit rate in the data. The associated φ̄L = 0.011. If we further set π = 0.1, i.e., the
proportion of dishonest borrowers is around 10%, then Φ = 1.3.10 Consequently, based on our
calibration and the indeterminacy condition (39), we conclude that our baseline model does
generate self-fulfilling equilibria.

Our calibration uses a delinquency rate of approximately 10%, which is of the same magnitude as in the Great Recession but higher than the average delinquency rate in the data (the
average is 3.73% from period 1985 to 2013). Delinquency rates do vary over time, however.
For example commercial residential mortgages had high delinquency rates during 2009-2013,
which spread panic to financial markets through mortgage-backed securities and other derivatives. Nevertheless we will show in section 3, when we introduce reputational effects that
indeterminacy arises even if there is no default in equilibrium.

2.6

Global Dynamics

So far we have characterized the steady states and the local dynamics around these steady
states. We showed that for some parameters, the equilibrium around one of the steady states is
locally determinate. In this section, we analyze the global dynamics and then show that global
indeterminacy always exists in our model, even when where both steady states are saddles and
locally determinate.11
Note that it is impossible for us to obtain a two-dimensional autonomous dynamical system
that is only related to (Ct , Kt ). This is because we do not analytically formulate φt in terms
of (Ct , Kt ). One possible solution is to characterize a three-dimensional dynamical system on
(Ct , Kt , φt ). The main concern, however, is that it would be difficult, if not impossible, for us
to completely characterize the economic properties of the high-dimensional dynamical system.
Fortunately, we can still reduce the dynamical system to a two-dimensional one, but in terms
of (φt , Kt ), as shown in the following proposition.

Figure 3: Global Dynamics with One Saddle: A High π (we set π = 0.2923, while all
other parameter values are from Table 1.)
As stated in Lemma 1, the dynamical system on (φt , Kt ) has two steady states. Motivated
by Corollary 1, we consider two cases. In the first case, one of the steady states is a sink and
the other is a saddle. In the second case, both steady states are saddles.

2.6.1

Global Dynamics with Local Indeterminacy

We first consider the case in which one steady state is a sink. As illustrated in Figure 1, π (the
proportion of dishonest firms) is high and both steady state φ values are smaller than φmax
in this case. As noted before, there is local indeterminacy around the upper steady state but
local determinacy around the lower steady state. However, globally the local steady state is
also indeterminate as Figure 3 shows.
20

·

In Figure 3, the red line is the K̇t = 0 locus and the solid blue line is the φt = 0 locus. The
small circles indicate the initial conditions of trajectories. These two loci intersect twice at the
upper and lower steady states. For a given Kt , there is a unique φt such that the economy
converges to the lower steady state. The function giving the unique φt as Kt and converging
to the lower steady state is the saddle path in Figure 3, a dashed blue line. If the initial φt
is below this saddle path, the economy would eventually converge to the horizontal axis with
φt = 0 and some positive capital.12 By equation (43), this implies zero consumption which
violates the transversality condition for households, so paths starting below this saddle path
are ruled out. However, for a given Kt in the neighborhood of the lower steady state, a path
starting above the saddle path cannot be ruled out. Figure 3 shows that a trajectory that starts
above the saddle path initially moves down and to the left before turning right and up. The
economy then circles around the upper steady state and eventually converges to it. As both the
differential equations and the households’ transversality conditions are satisfied, such a path
is indeed an equilibrium path. As Figure 3 indicates, almost every initial φt that is above the
saddle path associated with the lower steady state will eventually converge to the upper steady
state. It is clear that during the convergence, the economy exhibits oscillations in Kt and φt .
Since output is Yt = πΦφt /(1 − φt ), it also exhibits boom and bust cycles. Such transition
dynamics toward the upper steady state therefore implies a rich propagation mechanism for
exogenous shocks. For example, if a transitory exogenous shock moves the economy away from
the upper steady state, then the economy will display persistent oscillation in output before
returning to the upper steady state.13
Figure 3 shows that for a given initial capital stock K0 , there are infinitely many deterministic equilibria defined by the initial value of φ0 that converges to the upper steady state
smoothly. However, there are at least two other types of equilibria with jumps in φt and hence
discontinuity in output. We delay discussing such equilibria when both steady states are saddles
to the next section. The stark contrast between the local dynamics and the global dynamics is
12

When φt = 0, both the capital utilization rate and the depreciation rate are zero.
The global dynamics depicted in the case of a local saddle and a sink may be analyzed via the two-parameter
Bogdanov-Takens (BT) bifurcation, which occurs at parameter values for the tangency point Ψ(φmax ) = πΦ, or
the BT point. By varying the parameters away from the BT point it is possible to analytically characterize the
dynamics for various parameter regions yielding either zero and two steady states, and the qualitative dynamics
and phase diagram in the region encompassing both steady states, including the saddle connection between the
steady states, as depicted in Figure 3 (see in particular Kuznetsov, 1998, p. 322). However, not all parameter
combinations are economically admissible. For Figure 3 we pick parameters in the economically admissible range.
The qualitative dynamics, steady states and the saddle connection will remain as we perturb parameters.

2.6.2

Global Dynamics with Two Saddles

In this section we study the global dynamics when π is low such that both steady states are
saddles, where φ̄H > φmax and φ̄L < φmax . We set π = 0.0615 for the following numerical
analysis, including in Figures 5 and 6. All other parameter values are the same as in Table
1.15 Figure 4 graphs the two saddle paths associated with these two steady states. This then
14

A large literature on local indeterminacy has already constructed stochastic equilibria by randomizing over
deterministic equilibria (with random jumps). So it may come as no surprise to some readers that there exist
equilibria with jumps in φt when one of the steady states is locally indeterminate.
15
To better illustrate the global dynamics with two saddles in Figure 4, we vary α from 0.33 to 0.62, and Φ
from 1.3 to 22. All other parameter values are from Table 1. The numerical analysis in this section, however,

22

implies that both steady states are globally indeterminate: for any given Kt , the economy can
be on either saddle path. Therefore globally there is still indeterminacy even around each of the
steady states. Furthermore, we can create very complicated equilibrium paths if we allow φt to
jump. We can construct two types of jumps to illustrate the point. The first type of jumps in
φt are deterministic and fully anticipated. Utility maximization then requires consumption to
change continuously. That is, consumption does not jump when φt jumps. Notice that φt = φ+
t
and φt = φ−
t yield the same consumption level for a given capital Kt . The economy can always
−
jump from φt = φ+
t > φmax to φt = φt < φmax and back without changing the value of

consumption on a deterministic cycle.
Figure 5 graphs one such possible equilibrium path for each of consumption, investment,
output and interest spread once we allow φt to jump. Initially, the economy is at point
K = 6.2783 and φ = 0.9717 > φmax and so C = 0.8723. With K = 6.2783, there exists
another φ = 0.8249 < φmax that yields C = 0.8723. The economy then follows the trajectory
according to equations (41) and (42). It takes around 4.41 years for the model economy to reach
K = 11.1719, φ = 0.9270 and C = 0.9307. We then let φ jump down to a level that allows consumption to remain at 0.9307 upon the jump. By construction, this leads to φ = 0.8241 < φmax
after the jump. We then let the economy follow the trajectory dictated by equations (41) and
(42) again for another 8.02 years to reach K = 6.2783, φ = 0.8249 and hence C = 0.8723.
Notice that the consumption level has returned to its initial level. We then let φ jump up from
φ = 0.8249 to φ = 0.9717. Again by construction, consumption does not change immediately.
We repeat this process and obtain the deterministic cycles in consumption, investment, output
and credit spread in Figure 5. The adverse selection problem is mild when φt > φmax , but
it becomes much worse when φt < φmax . Thus when φt jumps down, there is a collapse in
output. Households can ensure their consumption by disinvesting capital after φt jumps down.
In general, there are infinite ways to construct these deterministic cycles, as pointed out by
Christiano and Harrison (1999).16 Around the upper steady state, equilibrium φt can take
many (possibly infinite) values. Hence the equilibrium around the upper steady-state is still
indeterminate, albeit a saddle.
uses standard parameterization in Table 1, only changing the value of π from 0.1 to 0.0615.
16
These two φt which yield the same level of consumption correspond to two different branches in the differential
equations defined by Ct and Kt . As pointed out by Christiano and Harrison (1999) a model with two branches can
display rich global dynamics, regardless of the local determinacy. For example, we can construct an equilibrium
with regime switches along these branches. The jumps for φt in the differential equations defined by φt and Kt
correspond to the switch of branches in the dynamics defined for Ct and Kt .

Figure 5: Deterministic Cycles
Sunspot Equilibria Finally we can also construct a stochastic sunspot equilibrium by
allowing φt to jump randomly. More specifically, we introduce sunspot variables zt , which take
two values, 1 and 0. We assume that in a short time interval dt, there is probability λdt that
the sunspot variable will change from 1 to 0 and probability ωdt that it will change from 0 to
1. We construct the equilibrium φt as a function of Kt and sunspot zt , i.e., φt = φ(Kt , zt ), such
that φ(Kt , 1) > φ(Kt , 0). Thus the equilibrium φt will jump with an anticipated probability
when zt changes its value. When zt = 1, economic confidence is high so adverse selection is
mild. But when zt = 0, economic confidence is low, and adverse selection becomes severe. We
use the change in zt from 1 to 0 to trigger an economic crisis, and from 0 to 1 to stop the crisis
as economic confidence is restored. We set λ = 0.01 and ω = 0.025 as an example, which means
that the economy will remain in the normal, non-crisis mode with probability 0.7143. Since
jumps in φt are now stochastic, consumption is exposed to a jump risk. Therefore equation
(41) must be modified to take this risk into account. Denote φ1t = φ(Kt , 1) and φ0t = φ(Kt , 0).

in crisis times when zt = 0.
It is evident that if λ = ω = 0, then φ1t = φ(Kt , 1) and φ0t = φ(Kt , 0) are functions defining
the saddle paths toward the upper and lower steady states, respectively. By continuity, these
two functions exist for small λ and ω. We solve these two functions using the collocation
method discussed in Miranda and Fackler (2002). More specifically we employ a 15-degree
Chebychev polynomial of K to approximate these two functions. Once we obtain φ1t = φ(Kt , 1)
and φ0t = φ(Kt , 0) as functions of capital Kt , we can then use equation (41) to simulate the
dynamic path of capital. Figure 6 shows a possible dynamic path for this economy.
We assume that the economy is initially in the normal, non-crisis mode with zt = 1 for a
sufficiently long period. Hence capital, consumption, output, and investment do not change.
The parameter values we choose yield K = 10.5427. Due to precautionary savings, this level of
capital is higher than the deterministic upper steady state level of capital, as households have
an incentive to save to insure against a stochastic crash in output. The economy stays at this
level of capital for 2.5 years, and then a crisis emerges, triggered by a drop in zt from 1 to 0.
The spread (the bottom-right panel of Figure 6) immediately jumps up as the adverse selection
problem in the credit market deteriorates sharply. As a result, production and output collapse
(the bottom-left panel). Since the timing of this collapse in output is unpredictable ex ante,
consumption drops immediately (the top-left panel). Investment (the top-right panel) falls for
two reasons: one is to partially offset the fall in output to finance consumption, and the other
is due to the decline in the effective return as a result of severe adverse selection in the credit
market. The economy stays in crisis mode for about a year before confidence is restored and

the recession is over. Interestingly output and investment both over-shoot when the recession
is over, and the longer the economy stays in recession, the larger the amount of overshoot. The
longer the recession, the smaller the amount of capital remaining. The return to investment
therefore is very high, and the households opt to work hard and invest more to enjoy this high
return from investment. Figure 6 shows several large boom and bust cycles due to stochastic
jumps in the sunspot variables. Thus there are rich multiple-equilibria in our benchmark model
regardless of the model parameters.

Reputation

We now study the sensitivity of our indeterminacy results to reputational effects under adverse
selection. If firms were not anonymous in the market, they may default all the time without
a care for their reputation. But they are not and lenders may also refrain from lending to
firms with a bad credit history. Arguably, these market forces can alleviate the asymmetric
information problem. We therefore examine whether the indeterminacy results obtained in our
baseline model can survive if such reputational effects are taken into account.

26

We follow Kehoe and Levine (1993) closely in modeling reputation. Firms are infinitelylived and can choose to default at any time. Firms that default may, with some probability,
acquire a bad reputation and may be excluded from the credit market forever. In equilibrium,
the fear of that happening discourages firms from defaulting. We will show that self-fulfilling
equilibria still exist even if there are no defaults in equilibrium.
To keep the model analytically tractable, we assume that all firms are owned by a representative entrepreneur. The entrepreneur’s utility function is given by
Z ∞
U (Cet ) =
e−ρe t log(Cet )dt,

(45)

0

where Cet is the entrepreneur’s consumption and ρe her discount factor. For tractability, we
assume ρe << ρ so that the entrepreneur does not accumulate capital. The entrepreneur’s
consumption equals the firm’s profits,
Z

1

Πt (i)di ≡ Πt ,

Cet =

(46)

0

where Πt (i) denotes the profit of firm i.
Since the only cost of defaulting is the loss of future production opportunities, the price
must exceed the marginal cost (also the average cost) of production to be profitable. If the price
exceeds the marginal cost, each firm will then have an incentive to produce an infinite amount.
To overcome this problem, we assume that the production projects of firms are indivisible, as
in the benchmark model, and that they produce to meet the orders they receive. A production
project produces a flow of final goods Φ from intermediate goods. Each unit of the final good
requires one unit of the intermediate good for its production. The project is carried out only
if the firms receive a purchase order. Denote the total demand for the final good by Yt . Then
a fraction ηt = Yt /Φ of firms will receive a purchase order. Again we assume that firms must
borrow to finance their working capital. Denote the intermediate good price by Pt , so they
must borrow Pt Φ to produce Φ.
To illustrate the reputation problem, let us consider a short time interval from t to t + dt.
We use V1t (V0t ) to denote the value of a firm that receives an order (no orders). We can then
formulate V1t recursively as
−ρe dt

V1t = (1 − φt )Φdt + e



Ce,t
Ce,t+dt


(ηt+dt V1t+dt + (1 − ηt+dt )V0t+dt ) ,

(47)

where φt = Pt is the unit production cost. If φt < 1, then the firm makes a positive profit
from production. The second term on the right-hand side is the continuation value of the
27

firms. Since firms are owned by the entrepreneur, the future value is discounted by the ratio
of marginal utilities of the entrepreneur. Since there is no default in equilibrium, the gross
interest rate for a working capital loan is Rf t = 1.
The firms can also choose to default on their working capital and obtain an instantaneous
gain of Φφt . However, default comes with the risk of acquiring a bad reputation. Upon default,
a firm acquires a bad reputation in the short time interval between t and t + dt with probability
λdt. In that case, the firm will be excluded from production forever. The payoff for defaulting
is hence

Define Vt = ηt V1t + (1 − ηt )V0t as the expected value of the firm. The firm has no incentive to

For simplicity, we assume Φ is big enough such that ηt = Yt /Φ < 1 always holds. The average
profit is then obtained as Πt = (1 − φt )Yt . Then using Cej = Πj and integrating the right-hand
side of equation 51, we have
Vt =

(1 − φt )Yt
.

The households’ budget constraint becomes

(53)

Then the incentive constraint (50) becomes
φt Φ ≤ λ

.
ρe

(54)

17
Under the incentive compatibility condition we can consider one-step deviations since V1t ,and V0t are then
optimal value functions.

28

From the budget constraint (53), we know that household utility increases with φt and thus
the incentive constraint (54) must be binding. Then equation (54) can be simplified to
φt =
where now π ≡

ρe
λ.

Yt
< 1,
πΦ + Yt

(55)

Similar to the baseline model, here firms also receive an information rent.

However, the rent in the baseline is derived from hidden information while the rent here arises
from hidden action. As indicated in equation (55), φt is procyclical and hence the markup is
countercyclical. When output is high, the total profit from production is high. Therefore the
value of a good reputation is high and the opportunity cost of defaulting also increases. This
then alleviates the moral hazard problem since a high output dilutes the information rent.
The cost minimization problem again yields the factor prices given by equation (20) and
(21). Since households do not own firms, their budget constraint is modified to
Ct + K̇t = φt Yt − δ (ut ) Kt .

(56)

The equilibrium system of equations is the same as in the baseline model except that equation
(19) is replaced by equation (56). The steady state can be computed similarly. The steady
state output is given by

Unlike in the baseline model, here the steady state equilibrium is unique as Y (φ) is monotonic.18
We summarize the result in the following lemma.
Lemma 3 If α < 21 , a consistently standard calibrated value of α, then the steady state equilibrium is unique for any Φ̄ > 0.
We can now study the possibility of self-fulfilling equilibria around the steady state. Since
φ and Φ̄ form a one-to-one mapping, we will treat φ as a free parameter in characterizing the
indeterminacy condition. We can then use equation (58) to back out the corresponding value of
Φ̄. The following proposition specifies the condition under which self-fulfilling equilibria arise.
18
Note that compared to equation (32), φ is missing from the numerator of the second bracket in equation
(57).

A3 ≡ (1 + θ) (1 − α) [s + (1 − s) γ] .
Indeterminacy implies that the model exhibits multiple expectation-driven equilibria around
the steady state. The steady state equilibrium is now unique however, which suggests that the
continuum of equilibria implied by indeterminacy cannot be obtained in static models studied
in the earlier literature. So far, the condition for sustaining indeterminacy has been given in
terms of φ and τ . The following corollary specifies the underlying condition in terms of ρe , λ
and Φ.

Given the other parameters, a decrease in ρe or an increase in λ increases the steady state
φ. According to the above lemma, this makes indeterminacy less likely. The intuition is
straightforward. A large λ means the opportunity cost of defaulting increases, as the chances
of the firm’s being excluded from future production increases. This alleviates the moral hazard
problem, which is the source of indeterminacy. Similarly, a decrease in ρe means that the
entrepreneurs become more patient. The future profit flow from production becomes more
valuable to them, which again increases the opportunity cost of defaulting and thus alleviates
the moral hazard problem.

Adverse Selection with Heterogeneous Productivity

Liu and Wang (2014) show that credit constraints can generate aggregate increasing returns
to scale. We now explore the possibility of increasing returns to scale by modifying our model
in section 2 . The households’ problems as in the benchmark model and thus the first-order
conditions are still equations (5), (6) and (7).

30

We now assume that the risk of lending to final good firms is continuous. We index the
final goods firms by j ∈ [0, 1]. Again each final goods firm has one production project, which
requires Φ units of intermediate goods. The loan is risky as production may not be successful.
More specifically, we assume that final goods firm j’s output is governed by

ajt xjt ,
with probability qjt
yjt =
,
0,
with probability 1 − qjt

(59)

where xjt is the intermediate input for firm j and ajt the firm’s productivity. We assume qjt
−ζ
is i.i.d. and drawn from a common distribution function F (q) and ajt = amin qjt
. So a higher

productivity ajt is associated with a lower probability of success qjt . Notice that expected
1−ζ
productivity is given by qjt ajt = amin qjt
. We assume, however, that ζ < 1, i.e., a firm with

a higher success probability enjoys a higher expected productivity. Denote by Pt the price
of intermediate goods. Then the total borrowing is given by Pt xjt . Denote by Rf t the gross
interest rate. Then final goods firm j 0 s profit maximization problem becomes
max qjt (ajt xjt − Rf t Pt xjt ) ,

(60)

xjt ∈{0,Φ}

Note that due to limited liability, the final goods firm pays back the working capital loan only
if the project is successful. This implies that, given Rf t and Pt , the demand for xjt is simply
given by

This establishes that only firms with risky production opportunities will enter the credit markets, which highlights the adverse selection problem in the financial market. Firms with qjt > qt∗

increases with the threshold qt∗ . This is intuitive: as the threshold increases, more firms with
high productivity enter the credit market, making resource allocation more efficient. Equation
(65) implies that qt∗ increases with Yt , and thus we get the following lemma.
Lemma 4 TFP is endogenous and increases in Y, i.e.,

∂Γ(qt∗ )
∂Yt

> 0.

We have therefore established that the endogenous TFP is procyclical. Notice that the
procyclicality of endogenous TFP holds generally for continuous distributions. Hence without
loss of generality, we now assume F (q) = q η for tractability. In turn, firm-level measured
productivity

follows a Pareto distribution with the shape parameter η, which is consistent

with the findings of a large literature (see, e.g., Melitz (2003) and references therein). Under
the assumption of a power distribution, combining equations (65) and (67) yields the aggregate

The intuition is as follows. Here a lending externality emerges because of adverse selection
in the credit markets. Suppose that the total lending from financial intermediaries increases.
32

This creates downward pressure on interest rate Rf t , which increases the cutoff qt∗ according to
the definition in equation (62). Firms with a higher q have a smaller risk of default. A rise in
the cutoff qt∗ therefore reduces the average default rate. If the rise is big enough, it can in turn
stimulate more lending from the financial intermediaries. Since firms with a higher q are also
more productive on average, the increased efficiency in reallocating credit implies that resources
are better allocated across firms. Notice that the aggregate output again exhibits increasing
returns to scale. Equation (69) reveals that the degree of increasing returns to scale clearly
depends on the adverse selection problem and decreases with ζ and η. When η = ∞, the firms
produce product of homogeneous quality. Hence there is no asymmetric information or adverse
selection. If ζ = 1, firms are equally productive in the sense that their expected productivity
is the same. It therefore matters not how credit is allocated among firms. Given ζ < 1, a
smaller η implies that firms are more heterogenous, creating a larger asymmetric information
problem. Similarly, given η, a smaller ζ implies that the productivity of firms deteriorates more
quickly with respect to their default risk, making adverse selection more damaging to resource
allocation. We formally state this result in the following proposition.
Proposition 4 The reduced-form aggregate production in our model exhibits increasing returns
to scale if and only if adverse selection exists, i.e., ζ < 1 and η < ∞.
In an important contribution, Basu and Fernald (1997) document increasing returns to scale
in aggregate production but not at the micro level. In a recent paper, Liu and Wang (2014)
show how credit constraints can generate endogenous variation in TFP, and hence aggregate
increasing returns. In their model, the less productive firms are driven out of production.
Different from Liu and Wang (2014), firms in our model do not suffer from credit constraints;
the more productive firms in our model are driven out of production due to adverse selection.
As in the benchmark model, both the credit spread, Rf t − 1, and the expected default
risk, 1 − E (q|q ≤ qt∗ ), are countercyclical. These predictions are consistent with the empirical
regularities found by Gilchrist and Zakrajšek (2012) and many others.

determine the seven variables, Ct , Yt , Nt , ut , Kt , Wt and Rt . The steady state can be obtained
as in the baseline model. We can express the other variables in terms of the steady state φ.
33

Since φ is unique, unlike in the baseline model, the steady state here is unique. We assume
that Φ is large enough so that an interior solution to q ∗ is always guaranteed. The following
proposition summarizes the conditions for indeterminacy in this extended model.
Proposition 5 Given the power distribution, i.e., F (q) = q η (or equivalently, firm productivity conforms to a Pareto distribution), the steady state is unique. Moreover, the model is
indeterminate if and only if

− 1.

To better understand the proposition, we first consider how output responds to a fundamental shock, such as a change in A, the true TFP. Let us define 1 + σ̃ as the multiplier of
adverse selection. Holding factor inputs constant, we have


d log Yt
1+θ
1 + σ̃ ≡

d log A
1 + θ − α (1 + σ)

(71)

The above equations show that adverse selection and variable capacity utilization can amplify the impact of a TFP shock on output. Note that the necessary condition σ > σmin can
be written as
(1 + σ̃)(1 − α) − 1 > γ.

(72)

The model is indeterminate if the multiplier effect of adverse selection is sufficiently large.
The restriction σ < σmax is typically automatically satisfied. The restriction σ <

1
α

− 1 simply

requires that α(1 + σ) < 1, which is the condition needed to rule out explosive growth in the
model.
Whether the model is indeterminate or not, equation (71) implies that the response of
output to TFP shocks is amplified. In addition, by Proposition 4, the economy is more likely
to be indeterminate if η is smaller. Our results are hence in the same spirit as those of Kurlat
(2013) and Bigio (2015), who show that a dispersion in quality will strengthen the amplification
effect of adverse selection.
Empirical Possibility of Indeterminacy To empirically evaluate the possibility of indeterminacy, we set the same values for ρ, θ, δ, α and γ as in Table 1.19 We also have new
parameters in this extended model, (ζ, η). We use two moments to pin them down and set
ζ and η to match the steady state markup

Since Φ does not affect the indeterminacy condition, we do not need to specify its value.

aggregate increasing returns to scale in manufacturing to be approximately 1.1. Thus we set
σ = 0.1. This leads to ζ = 0.55 and η = 4.5. We have σmin = 0.083 and σmax ≡ 2, which meet
the indeterminacy conditions. Hence, with these parameters the model exhibits self-fulfilling
equilibria.

Further Robustness Analysis

Monopoly Banking

We have so far assumed that financial intermediaries are fully competitive. As is well known,
in a static setting the market structure is important for the existence of multiple equilibria.
Here we check the robustness of our results by introducing banks that have monopoly power
and do not take the interest rate as given. The expected profits of these banks are then given
by (assuming all profits go to the representative household)

(76)

All other results are the same as in the previous part, especially the indeterminacy condition.
This further highlights the different sources of multiple equilibria in our dynamic model than
those in a static model.

5.2

Endogenous Production Capacity

Our model has assumed a fixed project size. By construction, when total lending increases,
as the riskier borrowers are in their full capacity, the additional lending will be allocated to
the more credit-worthy borrowers. If the riskier borrowers could expand their capacity instead
35

and absorb the additional lending, then the average quality of borrowers may decrease. The
lending externality in our previous setting would then disappear. We therefore extend our
model to endogenize firm capacity and show that our results are robust to such an extension.
We assume a continuum of types of firms as in section 4. Each firm has to pay ξ

Φ1+χ

units of

capital at time t in order to produce a maximum flow quantity of Φt in the time interval from
t to t + dt . Then firm type qjt is realized. As before, the firm borrows in order to produce if
and only if the probability of success is sufficiently low, namely, if and only if q ≤ qt∗ . (Here
qt∗ is defined as in equation (62).) The instantaneous profit for firm j is obtained by solving
maxxjt ∈{0,Φt } qjt (ajt xjt − Rf t Pt xjt ) . The solution is

Conclusion

We have shown that in a realistically calibrated dynamic general equilibrium model, adverse
selection in credit markets can generate a continuum of equilibria in the form of indeterminacy, either through endogenous markups or endogenous TFP. Adverse selection can therefore
potentially explain high output volatility as well as the emergence of probabilistic confidence
and credit crises, or boom and bust cycles with jumps in output, consumption and investment
in a fully rational expectations context, and in the absence of fundamental shocks. While the
standard RBC model with a negative TFP shock cannot fully explain the increase in labor productivity during the Great Recession (see Ohanian (2010)), this feature of the Great Recession
is consistent with the prediction of our baseline model in section 2, and is driven by pessimistic
beliefs about aggregate output. The pessimistic beliefs reduce aggregate demand and increase
markups, leading to a lower real wage and a lower labor supply. Labor productivity, however,
rises due to decreasing returns to labor.
To keep our analysis simple, we abstracted from certain important features of credit markets, for example, runs on various financial intermediaries that may amplify the initial adverse
selection problem as in the subprime mortgages during the Great Recession. Future research
may examine the effects of adverse selection among financial intermediaries.

Proofs

Proof of Lemma 1: The proof is straightforward. First, from the explicit form of Y (φ),


we can easily prove that Ψ(φ) ≡ 1−φ
· Y (φ) strictly increases with φ when φ ∈ (0, φ∗ ) but
φ
strictly decreases with φ when φ ∈ (φ∗ , 1). Second, since Ψ(0) < Φ̄ < Ψ∗ = Ψ(φ∗ ), there exists
a unique solution between zero and φ∗ , denoted by φ̄L , that solves Ψ(φ) = Φ̄. Likewise, there
also exists a unique solution between φ∗ and 1, denoted by φ̄H , that solves Ψ(φ) = Φ̄.
Proof of Lemma 2: Denote by ϕ1 and ϕ2 the eigenvalues of matrix J so that we have
ϕ1 + ϕ2 =Trace(J) and ϕ1 ϕ2 =Det(J). Then the model is indeterminate if the trace of J is
negative and the determinant is positive. The trace and the determinant of J are

Since τmin > 0,

− 1 + τ 2 > 0.
α(1 + γ) + (1 + θ)(1 − α)

Therefore Trace(J) < 0 if and only if τ > τmin . Next we determine the condition under which
Det(J) > 0. Note that Det(J) can be rewritten as

If τ < τmin , then we immediately have Det(J) < 0. Thus to guarantee Det(J) > 0, we must

Besides, we can easily verify that,

(log Ψ(φ)) < 0 always holds for φ ∈ (0, 1). Since τ ≡ 1−φ,

we know that ∆ (1 − φ) = Γ (φ). Denote by φ1 and φ2 the solutions to Γ (φ) = 0. Note that
φ1 + φ2 > 0, φ1 · φ2 > 0, and Γ (0) > 0, Γ (1) > 0. Therefore we know that 0 < φ1 < 1 < φ2 .
Consequently we conclude that
φ∗ = φ1 = 1 − τmax ∈ (0, 1) .
39

Proof of Proposition 1: By definition, τmax = 1 − φmin . Therefore we have φmin = φ∗ .
Then by Lemma 2 we know that
1. If φ < φmin , then Trace(J) < 0 and Det(J) < 0.
2. If φ ∈ (φmin , φmax ), then Trace(J) < 0 and Det(J) > 0.
3. If φ > φmax , then Trace(J) > 0 and Det(J) < 0.
Proof of Corollary 1: First, when adverse selection is severe enough, i.e., Φ̄ = πΦ ≥
Ψmax , the economy collapses. The only equilibrium is the trivial case with φ = 0. Given that

Φ̄ < Ψmax , Lemma 1 implies that there are two solutions, which are denoted by φ̄H , φ̄L . It
is always true that φ̄L < φ∗ < φ̄H . Then Lemma 2 immediately suggests that the steady state
φ̄L is always a saddle. Since Ψ(φ) decreases with φ when φ > φ∗ , as shown in Proposition 1,
indeterminacy emerges if and only if φ ∈ (φ∗ , φmax ). Therefore the local dynamics around the
steady state φ = φ̄H exhibits indeterminacy if and only if Ψ(φmax ) < Φ̄ < Ψmax .
Proof of Corollary 2:

Holding Φ constant, Φ̄ increases with π, the proportion of dishonest

firms. As is proved in Corollary 1, given Φ̄ < Ψmax , indeterminacy emerges if and only if
Φ̄ > Ψ(φmax ). Therefore the likelihood of indeterminacy increases with π.

the desired autonomous dynamical system in Proposition 2.
Proof of Corollary 3: We can easily verify that g (0) = g(1) = 0, g 00 (φ) < 0, and
g 0 (φmax ) = 0, where φmax = 1 − τmin , and τmin is defined in Lemma 2. Therefore we have
φmax = arg max g (φ) . It then follows from equation (43) that Ct is a hump-shaped function of
φt for a given level of Kt . Then we immediately obtain the results in Lemma 3.
Proof of Lemma 3:

Notice that Ψ(φ) =

2α−1

· Y (φ) ∝ (1 − φ)φ 1−α . When α < 12 , we

know that (1 − φ)φ 1−α is decreasing in φ. It is easy to check that limφ→0 Ψ(φ) = ∞ and
limφ→1 Ψ(φ) = 0. Hence equation (58) uniquely pins down the steady state φ for any Φ̄ > 0.

We can use equation (58) to solve for the steady state φ and use equation (A.10) to obtain the

respectively. The log-linearization of the system of equilibrium equations is given by

Therefore A1 τ 2 − A2 τ − A3 < 0 if and only if τ < τH , where τH is the positive solution to

Proof of Proposition 5:

First, given the power distribution, i.e., F (q) = q η , we can an-

alytically obtain the dynamical system, and then easily verify the uniqueness of the steady
state. It remains for us to pin down the indeterminacy region. To establish the conditions for
indeterminacy, we first log-linearize the equilibrium equations. Substituting out ût from the
log-linearized equation (24), we obtain
ŷt = ak̂t + bn̂t ,
where a =

θα(1+σ)
1+θ−α(1+σ)

(1+θ)(1−α)(1+σ)
1+θ−α(1+σ) .

and b =

Finally, expressing n̂t from the log-linearized

equation (22), we obtain
ŷt = λ1 k̂t + λ2 ĉt ,
where λ1 ≡

a(1+γ)

and λ2 ≡ − 1+γ−b
