PATH DEPENDENCE IN AGGREGATE OUTPUT

ABSTRACT

This paper studies an economy in which incomplete markets
and strong complementarities interact to generate path dependent
aggregate output fluctuations. An economy is said to be path
dependent when the effect of a shock on the level of aggregate
output is permanent in the absence of future offsetting shocks.
Extending the model developed in Durlauf 11991(a),(b)). we
analyze the evolution of an economy which consists of a countable

infinity of industries. The production functions of individual
firms in each industry are nonconvex and are linked through

localized technological complementarities. The productivity of
each finn at t is determined by the production decisions of
technologically similar industries at t-1. No markets exist
which allow finns and industries to exploit complementarities by
coordinating production decisions. This market incompleteness
produces several interesting effects on aggregate output
behavior. First, multiple stochastic equilibria exist in
aggregate activity. These equilibria are distinguished by
differences in both the mean and the variance of output. Second,
output movements are path dependent as aggregate productivity
shocks indefinitely affect real activity by shifting the economy
across equilibria. Third, when aggregate shocks are recurrent,
the economy cycles between periods of boom and depression.
Simulations of example economies illustrate how market
incompleteness can produce rich aggregate dynamics.

Introduction

Recent developments in theoretical macroeconomics have emphasized the
potential for multiple, Pareto-rankable equilibria to exist for economies where various
Arrow-Debreu assumptions are violated. Authors such as Diamond [19821 and Cooper

and John [1988] have emphasized how incomplete markets can lead to coordination
failure as economies may become trapped in Pareto-inferior equilibria; lEcHer [1986, 1990]

and Murphy, Shleifer and Vishny [1989] have obtained similar results due to imperfect
competition. These different approaches share the idea that strong complementarities in

behavior can lead to multiplicity. Intuitively, when technological or demand spillovers

make agents sufficiently interdependent, high and low levels of activity can represent
internally consistent equilibria in the absence of complete, competitive markets. Most of

these models describe multiple steady states in economies rather than multiple
nondegenerate time series paths and consequently cannot address issues of aggregate
fluctuations.1 Further, this literature has not shown how economies can shift across
equilibria, inducing periods of boom and depression.

A separate empirical literature has concluded that output fluctuations are
strongly persistent. Researchers such as Campbell and Mankiw [19871, Durlauf 11989]
and Phillips [1990] have concluded from a variety of perspectives that aggregate output in

advanced industrialized economies contains a unit root. Perron [1989], on the other hand,

has argued that real GNP data reflects one or two trend breaks. One interpretation of
this result is that the probability density characterizing innovations to a stochastic trend
places a large weight on zero. Hamilton 11988] finds evidence of persistence in the sense

that the mean of permanent output movements is a function of whether the economy is

in a state of boom or recession. Despite differences in both the methodologies and
conclusions of work on output persistence, this literature has generally concluded that
1lmportant exceptions to this claim are Diamond and Fudenberg [1990], which
describes how self-fulfilling expectations lead to cycles in search models and Heller 11990]
which models multiple capital accumulation paths in models with imperfect competition.

long run forecasts of real activity are strongly dependent on some part of contemporary
fluctuations.
One interpretation of the many results on output persistence is that real activity

is path dependent'— the long term behavior of output is affected by the sample path

realization of the economy. This notion has been employed to understand such
phenomena as the evolution of particular technologies (David [1986,1988], Arthur [1989]),

the distribution of trading patterns (Krugrnan [1990,1991)) and the emergence of multiple

equilibria in aggregate activity (Durlauf [1991(a),(b)]). David [1988] argues that path
dependent models can provide a general framework for integrating economic theory with

economic history. The literature on path dependence has generally argued that the
realized pattern of economic activity induces intertemporal complementarities in
production, which leads to multiple time series paths for the same economy. As such,
this literature contains ideas very similar to the work on multiple equilibria and
coordination failure.

One definition of path dependence, which we employ in this paper, is as follows.

Suppose that aggregate output in the economy, Y2, is a measurable function of some set
of exogenous variables.2 Denote the u-algebra characterizing the history of these

exogenous variables as

which

means that Y e 1Y. Innovations to the exogenous
variables lie in the changes in the sequence of c-algebras, i.e.
— j3. Further,
suppose that the stochastic process characterizing the exogenous variables has the
property that for all I greater than some fixed date T, a4— a = 0, which means that
no new innovations affect the economy after 7'.

innovations can have indefinite effects on real activity. One may verify that models with
unit roots, trend breaks, or state dependent growth rates are all path dependent according

to this definition. At the same time, the definition incorporates stationary, nonergodic

economies as well as economies which shift between equilibria.

Path dependent
economies exhibit substantial output persistence as the effects of an economy's realized
sample path can have permanent effects in the absence of offsetting future shocks.

The purpose of the current paper is to understand the implications of models of
multiple equilibria for path dependence. We do this by modelling coordination problems

in an explicitly stochastic framework.

As developed in Durlauf [1991(a),(b)1, the
microeconomic specification of the economy is expressed as a set of conditional
probability measures describing how individual agents behave given the economy's
history. An aggregate equilibrium exists when one can find a joint probability measure
over all agents which is consistent with these conditional measures; multiplicity occurs
when more than one such measure exists. This approach, by expressing the equilibrium

of the economy as a stochastic process, permits one to describe directly the time series
properties of aggregate fluctuations along different equilibrium paths.

Specifically, we examine the capital accumulation problems of a set of infinitely-

lived industries. We deviate from standard analyses in two respects. First, firms in each

industry face a nonconvex production technology.

Second, industries experience

technological complementarities as past high production decisions by each industry
increase the current productivity of several industries. Learning-by-doing is one example

of this phenomenon. Industries do not coordinate production decisions because of
incomplete markets. By describing how output levels and productivity evolve as
industries interact over time, the model characterizes the impact of complementarities
and incomplete markets on the structure of aggregate fluctuations.

Our basic results are threefold.

First, we show that with strong

complementarities and incomplete markets, multiple stochastic equilibria can exist in
aggregate activity. These equilibria are distinguished by differences in both the mean and
3

the variance of output. Second, we illustrate how aggregate output movements will be
persistent as aggregate productivity shocks indefinitely affect real activity by shifting the

economy across equilibria. Third, we provide conditions on the aggregate productivity
shocks which will cause the economy to cycle across equilibria. Although the current
model does not exhibit a unit root, one will emerge if deterministic technical change is
introduced.
Section I of this paper outlines the evolution of an economy composed of a large

set of industries whose production functions are linked by localized intertemporal
complementarities.

Section II describes how multiple equilibria can arise when the

economy experiences industry-specific shocks. Section HI explores the implications of

aggregate or economy-wide shocks for path dependence. Section IV simulates several
examples of the economy to see what sort of time series patterns emerge in aggregate

output. Section V contains summary and conclusions. A Technical Appendix follows
which contains proofs of all Theorems.

L A model of interacting industries
Consider a countable infinity of industries indexed by L3 Each industry consists

of many small, identical firms. All firms produce a homogeneous good; industries are

distinguished by distinct production functions rather than distinct outputs.

The

homogeneous final good may be consumed by the owners of the firms or converted to a

capital good which fully depreciates after one period.

consumers are risk neutral, as the expected utility of consumer r takes the form

When agents are risk neutral, the weights fi' correspond to date-zero Arrow-Debreu
prices. Our model is therefore a variant of the economy analyzed in Brock and Mirman
[1972).

economic development.

high production. Specifically, net capital NK1, which equals K c' for technique 1 and
K1 for technique 2, has a strictly higher marginal (and by implication total) product
when used with technique 1 than technique 2. A firm chooses technique 1 if it is willing
to pay fixed capital costs in exchange for higher output.

Both techniques are assumed to exhibit technological complementarities, as the

history of realized activity determines the parameters of the production function at I
Homer's [1986] model of social increasing returns shares this feature. Arrow [1962]
postulated that these types of productivity spillovers could occur due to learning-by-

doing. Our specification of complementarities differs from Homer's in two respects.
First, all complementarities are local as the production function of each firm is affected
by the production decisions of a finite number of industries. The index i orders industries

by similarity in technology; spillovers occur only between similar technologies. David
[1988) and Rosenberg [1982] describe the historical importance of local complementarities
6

in the evolution of technical innovations. Second, our complementarities are explicitly
dynamic. Past production decisionsaffect current productivity, which captures the idea
of learning-by-doing.

Specifically, we model the complementarities through the dependence of the
productivity shocks ( and m on the history of technique choices. This form for the

complementarities is appropriate when the amount of time spent at an activity is the

appropriate metric for the rate of learning-by-doing.

These intertemporal
complementarities are assumed to be the only source of dependence across shocks. In
addition, the aggregate productivity shocks obey a Markov process.4 Prob(r Iv) denotes

Markets are assumed to be missing in the sense that individual firms cannot
coordinate to exploit complementarities. Consequently, no industry may be compensated

for choosing technique 1 in order to expand the production sets of other industries; nor,

results still hold if there is feedback from the level of real activity at 1—1 to
7

given our conceptualization of industries as aggregates of many small producers, can firms

within an industry strategically choose a technique in order to induce higher future
productivity through complernentarities. Further, firms are assumed to be unable to
combine under joint management in order to internalize the complementarities.

It is straightforward to verify, from standard dynamk programming arguments,
that profit maximization by each firm implies that K1 is chosen to solve

suP(flfl(K-_FC ,e3—K1 ,f3f2(K1, t'tli, e)—K1,)

(4)

so long as the K1 is feasible V i. These capital choices are feasible whenever aggregate

output is sufficiently large at i—i. Without loss of generality, we place an additional
restriction on the level of output produced each period which ensures that the supply of
potential capital is as least as great as the demand implied by eq. (4) in all periods,
which renders the economy stationary.

Once technique choices are determined, one can solve for the optimal levels of

capital and output for each firm. In fact, a sufficient condition for the existence of
equilibrium capital and output sequences for all firms is the existence of a joint
probability measure over all technique choices which is consistent with the conditional

measures in Theorem 1. To see this, observe that the optimal choices of output and
capital for all industries at all dates obey the same conditional probability structure as
the technique choices,

Proh(L'1 t' Yi,vKi,t I

= Froô(w1,

'i 1,K w11_1 I e

' E(1 I a1)), (6)

which means that the existence of a joint measure over the technique choices is equivalent

to the existence of a joint measure over all output and capital decisions.

The existence of an equilibrium may therefore be verified once it is established
that the initial conditions and transition probabilities in this economy always generate a

joint probability measure over {w0,w1,._wj, the set of technique choices over all
industries and all dates. The existence of an equilibrium can therefore be reduced to the

question of when a set of conditional probabilities may be extended to define a joint
probability measure over a set of random variables indexed by Z2, the two-dimensional
lattice of integers. Dobrushin 11968] has given conditions characterizing when such an
extension exists.5

The localized structure of our complementarities ensures that

Dobrushin's criteria are satisfied, which leads to Theorem 2.

H. Long run behavior under industry-specific shocks

In order to see how industry-specific and economy-wide shocks interact to affect

the aggregate equilibrium, we first consider the case where e = 0, no economy-wide
shocks exist.

We restrict the conditional probabilities in order to discuss multiplicity and
dynamics. Past choices of technique 1 are assumed to improve the current relative
productivity of the technique. As a result, technique 1 choices will propagate over time.

Further, we assume that w=l is a steady state, which means that when all productivity
spillovers are active, the effects are so strong that high production is always optimal.

is an equilibrium, the aggregate economy exhibits multiple equilibria

if for some initial conditions, ç'rz4 fails to emerge as I grows. Notice that even if 'o =?
favorable

productivity shocks will periodically induce industries to produce using

technique 1. The choice of technique 1 by one industry, through the complementarities,
increases the probability that the technique is subsequently chosen in several industries.

With strong spillovers, these effects may build up, allowing wr1 to emerge from any
initial conditions. The model therefore allows us to analyze the stability of a high
aggregate output equilibrium from arbitrary initial conditions.

In fact, the limiting behavior of the economy is determined by the bounds err
and

err'.

If the probability of high production by an industry is sufficiently large for

all production histories, then the spillover effects induced by spontaneous technique I
choices cause the economy to iterate towards high production. Alternatively, if technique
1 probabilities are too low in the absence of active spillovers, spontaneous technique 1
chokes will not generate sufficient momentum to achieve the
and

equilibrium.

e'r

err' bound the degree of complementarity in the economy. Large values of err

imply complementarities are weak as technique 1 is chosen relatively frequently regardless

of the past. Conversely, small values of err' imply strong complementarities; the
probability of current high production is very sensitive to past technique choices.
Theorem 3 shows how long run industry behavior is jointly determined by initial
conditions and conditional technique probabilities.

One can associate w1=1 with the equilibrium which would emerge if all firms

sufficiently higher for w=l versus any other configuration, then wzrt

emerges

as the

cooperative equilibrium after one period, as firms and industries will all choose technique

1 at t = 1 in order to achieve the productivity spillovers. Consequently, incompleteness
of markets lowers the mean and increases the variance of industry and aggregate output

along the inefficient equilibrium path, as technique choices fluctuate over time. When

industries fail to coordinate, production decisions become dependent on idiosyncratic
productivity shocks. Observe that the volatility associated with the inefficient

equilibrium is caused by fundamentals. Simulations in Durlauf [1991(a)] show that
aggregate output can obey a wide range of Alt processes, depending on the values of the
transition probabilities.

12

Now consider the role of the economy-wide shocks E• By affecting many
industries simultaneously, these shocks act in a way analogous to changing the initial
conditions of the economy. Path dependence occurs as one realization of 4 pcnnanently
changes the equilibrium in the absence of future offsetting shocks. In order to illustrate
path dependence, it is necessary to restrict both the way in which the aggregate shocks
interact with the industry production decisions as well as the structure of the aggregate
shocks themselves.

First, we assume that sufficiently unfavorable aggregate productivity draws make

the choke of technique 1 unlikely whereas sufficiently favorable draws ensure the use of

the technique. This means that particular aggregate productivity realizations can have
very powerful aggregate output effects.

This result shows how economy-wide shocks and consequently aggregate

fluctuations can be persistent. Persistence occurs when economy-wide shocks have the
effect of introducing new initial conditions in an economy with multiple equilibria. For

example, once many sectors simultaneously decline due to an adverse economy-wide
shock, productivity enhancing complementarities are lost until a subsequent favorable
economy-wide shock restores them.

Several interpretations beyond productivity can be applied to the economy-wide

shocks. Interpreting e as a proxy for the financial sector, the model indicates how the
breakdown of financial institutions, such as occurred during the Depression, can cause
indefinite output loss. Alternatively, Durlauf [1991(a)] shows how

can represent the

cost of production inputs provided by leading sectors such as transportation or steel. In

this case, the growth of leading sectors improves the relative profitability of high
production, which can lead to a takeoff in growth as the economy shifts across equilibria.

Fluctuations between the high and low equilibria will be triggered by movements

in the economy-wide shocks. The properties of

will determine whether the long run

behavior of aggregate output exhibits multiple equilibria in the following sense. When

the events ( a) and ( b) are recurrent, i.e. 4 enters•e.ach of the scts (—oo,a) and
(6,oo) infinitely often, then long run forecasts of the economy are unaffected by history in

the sense that any sample path history of the economy will, with probability 1, be
reversed by some future realization of the economy-wide shock.

Conversely, if the event (

0)

is nonrecurrent, then the economy-wide shocks

will have permanent effects since the events (5 C a)

and (

&) will, with probability 1,
occur only a finite number of times. By Theorem 2, in the absence of economy-wide

shocks in all periods, the long run behavior of the economy can depend on initial
conditions. Further, so long as Prob(e1 a), Prob(.1 1'), Pro6(( =

0

ct_i Ca) and

Froô(.5t = o i 4_4 6) are all nonzero, then two different sample path realizations of the

same economy can converge to different average levels of output, as either high or low

becomes 0. This
specific example illustrates the more general proposition that models where initial
production initial conditions may precede the period when each

conditions matter may be thought of as path dependent models with special assumptions
on the distributions of certain variables. Theorem 5 summarizes these ideas.

IV. Time series properties of aggregate output

In this section, we simulate the aggregate economy to see what sort of patterns
emerge in aggregate output fluctuations. We simulate economies based on the interaction

range Aii={i—1,i,i+l}. In each simulation, we construct a finite approximation to the

infinite economy consisting of 500 industries. Output per period by each industry is
normalized to equal 0 or 1. A {O,1} support for output may be justified by generalizing
Assumption 2 to model the two techniques as

= P if ic,t—1 k1(1,_11e1_1)
= 0 otherwise.

P2

if K1_1 K2('i111,e1_1)

= 0 otherwise.

(11)

and then normalizing output.9 In this specification, each firm produces a fixed output
level for each technique, Y1 or '21 given a fixed capital input of Rj((1 —1C—1) or
K2(t,1,_1,C_1) respectively. Under the specification, the productivity shocks act to affect

capital input requirements rather than output.

In constructing the simulations, it is necessary to place some restrictions on the
conditional production probabilities. First, we assume that the economy-wide shock

is

a Markov process with state space {—1,O,1) and transition matrix P.

We equate the values —1 with the event (

a) and 1 with the event ( b) as

described in Section III. We correspondingly define the two conditional probabilities

= II "1,t_i'' I e tS,1, 4 = —i) =

(12)

and

Frob(w11 =

ii w1, _1' 5€ Ak,,, ( = 1) = 1.

(13)

Finally, we reduce the number of relevant transition probability parameters to 3

when the economy-widc shock equals 0 by assuming that the associated conditional
probabilities obey

Prob(W1 = 1 IEw—1,_1 = 3,
Prob(w111 =

order to preserve the structure of the conditional probability measures of the two
techniques as described in Sections H and III.

This structure can be interpreted as saying each local cornplement.arity has the same

effect on the production function. Simulations of this structure have shown that the
model is nonergodic when all transition probabilities are below .45.

These restrictions specify the transition probabilities for all possible technique

choice histories. By varying P and 0, one can affect the time series properties of the
economy. For each simulation, we start with = Q and allow the economy to run for

2000 periods. In each case, a time series is computed for aggregate output. Each
regression was was constructed by using the last 1000 observations for all 500 industries.

Our first set of simulations examines the behavior of the economy when the
transition probabilities obey

economy-wide shocks are highly correlated. Second, the e

values

are such that the

economy possesses multiple equilibria when the economy-wide shocks equal 0. A sample

path realization of 80 industries over 80 periods is shown in Figure 1. As the Figure
indicates, the economy exhibits two separate regimes with substantially different levels of

mean activity and output volatility.10 Notice that even in periods of low aggregate

obeys V = .18+.49Y...1+.07Y_2+c1 when the economy-wide shocks are always 0.

interactions of the spontaneous production probability e3 with the productivity
spillovers. This feature illustrates how the model captures heterogeneity in industry
behavior during periods of economic decline. Aggregate output in this economy obeys

In this case,

aggregate output follows

(18)

The main difference between the two economies is that the degree of output persistence is
greatly reduced when the economy-wide shocks approach white noise. The AR coefficient

for aggregate output is reduced from .77 to .38. As Figure 2 shows, the economy shifts
between the two regimes quite frequently.

Finally, Figure 3 illustrates the economy when the aggregate shocks are
uncorrelatcd yet tend to be concentrated around zero, i.e.

a process which exhibits substantial persistence. This equation best illustrates how the

incomplete markets structure acts as a propagation mechanism as white noise
productivity shocks lead to substantial autoregression in the aggregate output process.11

Our next three simulations consider the behavior of the economy when only one

limiting equilibrium exists. This is done by setting 01 = .7, 02 = .65, 03 = .6. Figure 4
illustrates the behavior of a time series cross-section for the transition matrix P1. In this
case, the aggregate output equation is

A realization of this economy may be seen in Figure 5.

Finally, the P3 transition matrix generates the aggregate output equation

11Recalling our earlier discussion, if the expected payoff from cooperation is high

enough, then the complete markets equilibrium is = V t, even in the presence of
aggregate shocks, which means that the complete markets equilibrium will exhibit no
volatility.

As before, substantial pcrsistence can be generated by white noise shocks interacting with

the dynamic complementarities. A sample realization appears in Figure 6.

One interesting feature of Figures 4 to 6 is the evolution towards the high
equilibrium after negative productivity shocks. As the Figures indicate. (and the model
analytically implies for these parameter values), the percentage of industries choosing low

production gradually declines after = —1 realizations. This behavior suggests a reason
why business cycles may exhibit sharp rapid declines in output during recessions and
gradual periods of recovery. When the high production equilibrium is stable, aggregate
output will gradually adjust towards the equilibrium after negative economy-wide shocks.

On the other hand, when there are two equilibria, there is no tendency for the economy to

correct itself after large output declines. Consequently, our model implies a relationship
between the number of equilibria and the degree of asymmetry of the business cycle.

V. Summary and conclusions

This paper has explored how economies can exhibit multiple equilibria and
output persistence as a consequence of dynamic coordination failure. These features arise

when strong technological complementarities interact with incomplete markets. Low
production initial conditions prevent an economy from realizing local technological
spillovers.

Further, economy-wide shocks can generate indefinite movements in total

output as local productivity feedbacks induced by complementarities emerge or disappear.

The model exhibits both path dependence of shocks as well as a mechanism for reversals
of booms and downturns.

One application of these ideas is to explore whether output behavior during the

Depression and World War H can be described as movements across equilibria. Most
analyses of output behavior during the 1930's and 1940's have interpreted the Depression
21

and recovery as the consequence of two large offsetting shocks rather than a result of one

shock which interacted with some sort of self-correcting mechanism in the aggregate
economy. The idea that the Depression was not self-correcting, yet was overcome by a
large aggregate demand shock is compatible with the model in this paper, when multiple

equilibria are present. An important empirical extension of the current paper is the
identification of complementarities in the time series patterns of industrial production
which are sufficiently strong to be consistent with our model. This approach is pursued
in Cooper and Durlauf [1991].

Technical Appeiidix

Proof of Theorem 1

If a firm were constrained to use technique 1 each period, standard Euler
equation arguments (see Brock and Mirman [1972]) imply that an optimal capital
sequence {K1 j is implicitly defined by

ir1((1 E) = mzz
1,1,1

whereas

13f1(K1,

(A. 1)

if the firm were constrained to use technique 2 each period, an optimal capital

sequence would obey

By our assumptions, 1((11,e,) and ir2(ii1,e,) are measurable functions of the
productivity shocks.

This says that if one technique generates higher one period
Let

profits than the other, it is chosen with certainty, whereas if the techniques generate

identical profits, technique 1 is chosen according to a time invariant function of the
productivity shocks. Any such rule generates a sequence of technique choices which are

consistent with the solution to a representative firm's maximization problem. Since all
firms within an industry are identical, we can conclude that w1 is a measurable function

of (,

immediately yields Theorem 1, given the restrictions on the conditional probability

and

in Assumption 2.

Proof of Theorem 2

Dobrushin [1968) provides conditions for proving the existence of a joint
probability measure which is consistent with a given set of conditional measures. We
verify Theorem 1 by proving the existence of a joint measure over the random vectors

= {c1,,ii11,4,,wj. Observe that the random vectors
can be indexed by 2; we
let t/. =
denote the joint realizations of
= {bo,tPi,...,tPt) denote the history of the random
the random vectors at each and
vectors up to t.
The first condition for showing the existence of a joint measure is to show that

conditional probabilities can be consistently defined over all finite combinations of *1'

r

To see this, specify any initial conditions *110. Given the specification of a stochastic

process for , and the conditional probability structure specified in Assumption 2 for (1,1
and q, one can compute the conditional probabilities for any %b as well as for any
finite set in 'P1. Repeating this procedure, it is possible to assign probabilities for any
finite set in W. Letting t*oo, this means that all conditional probabilities over finite
sets can be consistently defined.

Second, we need to verify that for any finite set S and any 6 > 0, there exists a
finite set of elements, r(S, 6), S 1'(S, 6), such that

24

I Prob(S r)—Prob(Sl W—S) I 6.

(A.4)

This condition immediately holds for the probability structure we have examined.
Consider the case S=b where the range of interactions is Ak j• Choose the surrounding
set

F = {øp,q such iha 0< p—il k+I, 0< IrtI k-i-I).

which proves that a joint measure exists over W and hence over {co,c±?i,...'aJ.

Proof of Theorem 3

This Theorem is proven in Durlauf (1991(a)].

Proof of Theorem 4
Theorem 4 is proved if we can show that for any vector w,

To see that eqs. (A.10) and (A.11) are sufficient to verify the Theorem, observe that
those inequalities imply, given 1) Assumption 4.A, which shows that the conditional

which combined with (A.12) and (A.13) would verify Theorem 4.

(A.11) is immediate since both probabilities in the weak inequality equal 1 under

our assumptions. To see that (A.10) holds, observe that

(A.17)

Eqs. (A.15) and (A.16) imply eq. (A.1O), which completes the proof.
Proof of Theorem 5

Part A of the Theorem follows immediately from the definition of a recurrent

Markov process. If the events (4 C

a) and (4

6) each occur infinitely often, then the

impact of any sample path realization of the economy up to I on forecasts of the level of

output at H-s will become zero with probability 1 if the forecast horizon s is sufficiently
large. To verify Part B, observe that if the event (4 0) is nonrecurrent, then 0 must
be an absorbing state for 4. Consequently, either of the equilibria characterized in
Theorem 3 can emerge if both (4 a) and (4 ii) are possible candidates to be the last
event before 4

zero. if Prob(41

Prob(41 6), Prob(4 = 0 I _1 a) and
Prob(4 = 0 I 4—.i 6) are all nonzero, then either equilibrium can emerge with positive
probability. Further, for large enough T, 4T+. = 0 with probability 1 V a> 0, which
means that the last nonzero 4 will permanently affect conditional long run forecasts.
