With dogmatic beliefs in such models and an unconstrained ratio of position size to capital, optimal portfolios can differ across models to economically significant degrees.  The differences are substantially reduced by modest uncertainty about the models' pricing abilities.  When the ratio of position size to capital is subject to realistic constraints, the differences in portfolios across models become even less important, nonexistent in some cases.\n\n",
