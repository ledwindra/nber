    "abstract": "\n\nMillions of women continue to die during and soon after childbirth, even where the knowledge and resources to avoid this are available. We posit that raising the share of women in parliament can trigger action. Leveraging the timing of gender quota legislation across developing countries, we identify sharp sustained reductions of 8\u201312 percent in maternal mortality. Investigating mechanisms, we find that gender quotas lead to increases in percentage points of 5\u20138 in skilled birth attendance and 4\u20138 in prenatal care utilization, alongside a decline in fertility of 6\u20137 percent and an increase in the schooling of young women of about 0.5 years. The results are robust to numerous robustness checks. They suggest a new policy tool for tackling maternal mortality.\n\n",
