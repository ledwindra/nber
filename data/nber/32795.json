    "abstract": "\n\nWe estimate the effects of privatization on zombie versus healthy state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in China, extending our analysis beyond TFP to a broad array of financial and economic indicators. Privatizing zombie SOEs enhances labor productivity and TFP, reduces bank and government subsidies, alleviates leverage and administrative expenses, improves liquidity, boosts profits, and accelerates sales growth. These benefits are more pronounced than for healthy SOEs and are robust across regions and industries. Our findings offer policy implications for emerging markets, suggesting that prioritizing the privatization of underperforming, zombie-like entities can lead to substantial economic improvements and greater efficiency.\n\n",
