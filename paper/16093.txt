ABSTRACT
We study the effects of positive steady-state inflation in New Keynesian models subject to the zero
bound on interest rates. We derive the utility-based welfare loss function taking into account the effects
of positive steady-state inflation and show that steady-state inflation affects welfare through three
distinct channels: steady-state effects, the magnitude of the coefficients in the utility-function approximation,
and the dynamics of the model. We solve for the optimal level of inflation in the model and find that,
for plausible calibrations, the optimal inflation rate is low, less than two percent, even after considering
a variety of extensions, including price indexation, endogenous price stickiness, capital formation,
model-uncertainty, and downward nominal wage rigidities. On the normative side, price level targeting
delivers large welfare gains and a very low optimal inflation rate consistent with price stability.

“The crisis has shown that interest rates can actually hit the zero level, and when this happens it is a
severe constraint on monetary policy that ties your hands during times of trouble. As a matter of logic,
higher average inflation and thus higher average nominal interest rates before the crisis would have
given more room for monetary policy to be eased during the crisis and would have resulted in less
deterioration of fiscal positions. What we need to think about now is whether this could justify setting a
higher inflation target in the future.”

Introduction

One of the defining features of the current economic crisis has been the zero bound on nominal interest
rates. With standard monetary policy running out of ammunition in the midst of one of the sharpest
downturns in post-World War II economic history, some have suggested that central banks should
consider allowing for higher target inflation rates than would have been considered reasonable just a few
years ago. We contribute to this question by explicitly incorporating positive steady-state (or “trend”)
inflation in a New Keynesian model as well as the zero lower bound (ZLB) on nominal interest rates. We
derive the effects of non-zero steady-state inflation on the loss function, thereby laying the groundwork
for welfare analysis. In particular, we show that steady-state inflation affects welfare through three
distinct channels: steady-state effects, the magnitude of the coefficients in the utility-function
approximation, and the dynamics of the model. Our baseline finding is that the optimal rate of inflation is
low, less than two percent a year, even when we allow for a variety of features that would tend to lower
the costs or to raise the benefits of positive steady-state inflation.
Despite the importance of quantifying the optimal inflation rate for policy-makers, modern
monetary models of the business cycle, namely the New Keynesian framework, have been strikingly illsuited to address this question because of their near exclusive reliance on the assumption of zero steadystate inflation, particularly in welfare analysis.1 Our first contribution is to address the implications of
positive steady-state inflation for welfare analysis by solving for the micro-founded loss function in an
otherwise standard New Keynesian model with labor as the only factor of production. We identify two
costs of positive trend inflation due to price dispersion, one well-known and the other less so, if at all.
The first is the steady-state effect: with staggered price setting, higher inflation leads to greater price
dispersion which causes an inefficient allocation of resources among firms, thereby lowering aggregate
1

Most papers incorporating positive steady-state inflation into the New Keynesian framework have focused on the
implications for dynamics and determinacy issues. For example, Cogley and Sbordone (2008) show that accounting
for positive steady-state inflation significantly improves the fit of the New Keynesian Phillips Curve. Kiley (2007)
and Ascari and Ropele (2009) show that the Taylor principle is not sufficient to guarantee a unique rational
expectations equilibrium in New Keynesian models for even moderate levels of inflation. Coibion and
Gorodnichenko (2009) show that once this feature of New Keynesian models is incorporated into historical
monetary policy analysis, the pre-Volcker monetary policy rule ensured the presence of self-fulfilling expectational
fluctuations despite likely satisfying the Taylor principle, a reflection of the high target rate of inflation over this
time period.

welfare. The second is that positive steady-state inflation raises the welfare cost of a given amount of
inflation volatility. This reflects the fact that inflation variations create distortions in relative prices given
staggered price setting. Since positive trend inflation already generates some inefficient price dispersion,
the additional distortion in relative prices from an inflation shock becomes more costly as firms have to
compensate workers for the increasingly high marginal disutility of sector-specific labor. Thus, the
increased distortion in relative prices due to an inflation shock becomes costlier as we increase the initial
price dispersion which makes the variance of inflation costlier for welfare as the steady-state level of
inflation rises. In addition to the two costs from relative price dispersion, a third cost of inflation in our
model comes from the dynamic effect of positive inflation on pricing decisions. Greater steady-state
inflation induces more forward-looking behavior when sticky-price firms are able to reset their prices
because the gradual depreciation of the relative reset price can lead to larger losses than under zero
inflation. As a result, inflation is more volatile which lowers aggregate welfare. This cost of inflation
due to the positive relationship between the level and volatility of inflation has been well-documented
empirically but is commonly ignored in quantitative analyses because of questions as to the source of the
relationship.2 As with the first two costs of inflation, this cost arises endogenously in the New Keynesian
model when one incorporates positive steady-state inflation.
The key benefit of positive inflation in our model is a reduced frequency of hitting the zero bound
on interest rates. As emphasized in Christiano et al (2009), hitting the zero bound induces a deflationary
mechanism which leads to increased volatility and hence large welfare costs. A higher steady-state level
of inflation implies a higher level of nominal interest rates and therefore, as suggested by Blanchard, a
reduced incidence of zero-bound episodes.

Our approach for modeling the zero bound follows

Bodenstein et al (2009) by solving for the duration of the zero bound endogenously, unlike in Christiano
et al (2009) or Eggertsson and Woodford (2004). This is important because the welfare costs of inflation
are a function of the variance of inflation and output, which themselves depend on the frequency at which
the zero bound is reached as well as the duration of zero bound episodes.
After calibrating the model to broadly match the historical incidence of hitting the zero lower
bound in the U.S., we then solve for the rate of inflation that maximizes welfare. We show numerically
that the welfare loss function is generally concave with respect to steady-state inflation, such that the
optimal rate of inflation is positive as a result of the zero bound. However, for plausible calibrations of
the structural parameters of the model and the properties of the shocks driving the economy, the optimal
inflation rate is quite low: less than two percent per year. This result is remarkably robust to changes in
parameter values, as long as these do not dramatically increase the implied frequency of being at the zero
2

For example, Mankiw’s undergraduate Macroeconomics textbook notes that “in thinking about the costs of
inflation, it is important to note a widely documented but little understood fact: high inflation is variable inflation.”
Similar statements can be found in other prominent texts.

lower bound. Furthermore, we show that all three costs of inflation – the steady state effect, the
increasing cost of inflation volatility, and the positive link between the level and volatility of inflation –
are quantitatively important: each is sufficient to bring the optimal inflation rate down to 2.5% or lower
when the ZLB is present.
This low optimal rate of inflation is unlikely to be driven by a low cost of business cycles: our
model implies that eliminating business cycle fluctuations at the optimal inflation rate would improve
welfare by the equivalent of permanently raising consumption by 1.5%, in line with much of the literature
on business cycle costs (Barlevy (2004)). In addition, hitting the ZLB is quite costly in the model: our
calibration implies that at an annual inflation rate of 3%, a period of 8 quarters spent at the zero bound
reduces welfare by the equivalent of a permanent decrease in consumption of more than 4%, above and
beyond the welfare effects of the shocks which pushed the economy into the zero bound. Furthermore,
while the model implies that the optimal weight on the variance of the output gap in the welfare loss
function is small, we show that to push the optimal inflation rate above the typical inflation targets of
central banks would require this coefficient to be more than ten times larger than the weight on the
annualized inflation variance. Such weights would imply a welfare cost of being at the ZLB for 8
quarters roughly equal to a permanent decline in consumption of 40% ($4 trillion per year), a magnitude
which strikes us as too large to be plausible.
To further investigate the robustness of this result, we extend our baseline model to consider
several mechanisms which might raise the optimal rate of inflation. For example, in the presence of
uncertainty about the true parameter values, policy-makers might want to choose a higher inflation rate as
a buffer against the possibility that the true parameters imply more frequent and costly incidence of the
zero bound. We address this possibility in two ways. First, we calculate the optimal inflation rate taking
into account the uncertainty about parameter values and find that this raises the optimal inflation rate only
modestly, from 1.1% to 1.4% per year. Second, we repeatedly draw from the distribution of parameters
and calculate the optimal inflation rate for each draw. We find that the 90% confidence interval of
optimal inflation rates ranges from 0.1% to 2.2% a year, which closely mirrors the target range for
inflation of most modern central banks.
Similarly, one might be concerned that our findings hinge on modeling price stickiness as in
Calvo (1983). First, because this approach implies that some firms do not change prices for extended
periods of time, it could overstate the cost of price dispersion and therefore understate the optimal
inflation rate. To address this possibility, we reproduce our analysis using Taylor (1977) staggered price
setting of fixed durations.

The latter implies significantly less price dispersion than the Calvo

assumption, yet using this alternative pricing structure has no significant impact on the optimal inflation
rate. Second, the degree of price rigidity in both Calvo and Taylor pricing is commonly treated as a
3

structural parameter, yet it is unlikely that the frequency of price setting is completely independent of the
inflation rate, even for low inflation rates like those experienced in the U.S. As a result, we consider a
specification of the model in which the degree of price rigidity varies systematically with the trend level
of inflation but find that this modification also does not qualitatively change the optimal inflation rate.
Tobin (1972) suggests downward nominal wage rigidity as an additional factor which might push
the optimal inflation rate higher. By facilitating the downward adjustment of real wages in the presence
of downward nominal wage rigidity, positive inflation can be beneficial. We incorporate this “greasing
the wheels” effect by constraining changes in the aggregate nominal wage index to be non-negative.
Strikingly, this addition significantly lowers the optimal inflation rate. The intuition for this somewhat
surprising finding is that downward wage rigidity lowers the volatility of marginal costs and hence of
inflation. In addition, in the face of a negative demand shock, marginal costs decline by less in the
presence of downward-wage rigidity, leading to a smaller decline in inflation and thus a smaller change of
interest rates. Hence, the ZLB binds less frequently which further reduces the benefits of positive
inflation.
Our analysis abstracts from several other factors which might affect the optimal inflation rate.
For example, Friedman (1969) argued that the optimal rate of inflation must be negative to equalize the
marginal cost and benefit of holding money. Because our model is that of a cashless economy, this cost
of inflation is absent, but would tend to lower the optimal rate of inflation even further, as emphasized by
Khan et al (2003), Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe (2007, 2010) and Aruoba and Schorfheide (2009). Similarly,
a long literature has studied the costs and benefits of the seigniorage revenue to policymakers associated
with positive inflation, a feature which we also abstract from since seigniorage revenues for countries like
the U.S. are quite small, as are the deadweight losses associated with it.3 Feldstein (1997) emphasizes an
additional cost of inflation arising from fixed nominal tax brackets, which would again lower the optimal
inflation rate. Furthermore, while our model includes an inflation cost arising from the positive link
between the level and the volatility of inflation, it is likely that we still understate this cost of inflation
because we abstract from the possibility that higher inflation volatility will raise risk premiums due to the
increased risk of redistribution among borrowers and lenders. In addition, the relationship between the
level and the volatility of inflation could be even stronger than in our model because higher steady-state
inflation moves the economy closer to the indeterminacy region where sunspot shocks would further raise
inflation volatility. Finally, because we do not model the possibility of endogenous countercyclical fiscal
policy nor do we incorporate the possibility of nonstandard monetary policy actions during ZLB episodes,
it is likely that we overstate the costs of hitting the ZLB and therefore again overstate the optimal rate of
inflation.

This paper is closely related to recent work that has also emphasized the effects of the zero bound
on interest rates for the optimal inflation rate, such as Walsh (2009), Billi (2009), and Williams (2009). A
key difference between the approach taken in this paper and such previous work is that we explicitly
model the effects of positive trend inflation on the steady-state, dynamics, and loss function of the model.
Billi (2009) and Walsh (2009), for example, use a New Keynesian model log-linearized around zero
steady-state inflation and therefore do not explicitly incorporate the positive relationship between the
level and volatility of inflation, while Williams (2009) relies on a non-microfounded model. In addition,
these papers do not take into account the effects of positive steady-state inflation on the approximation to
the utility function and thus do not fully incorporate the costs of inflation arising from price dispersion.4
An advantage of working with a micro-founded model and its implied welfare function is the
ability to engage in normative analysis. In our baseline model, the endogenous response of monetary
policy-makers to macroeconomic conditions is captured by a Taylor rule. Thus, we are also able to study
the welfare effects of altering the systematic response of policy-makers to endogenous fluctuations (i.e.
the coefficients of the Taylor rule) and determine the new optimal steady-state rate of inflation.5 The
most striking finding from this analysis is that even modest price-level targeting would raise welfare by
non-trivial amounts for any steady-state inflation rate. In addition, by reducing the volatility of inflation
and output, and therefore the frequency of being at the zero lower bound on interest rates, price-level
targeting leads to much lower optimal rates of inflation than in our baseline findings. In a companion
paper (Coibion et al, 2010), we show that similar results obtain under the Ramsey-optimal policy,
consistent with the finding of Eggertsson and Woodford (2003) and Wolman (2005) that PLT closely
approximates the Ramsey-optimal policy.

In short, the optimal policy rule for the model can be

characterized by the name of “price stability” as typically stated in the legal mandates of most central
banks.
Section 2 presents the baseline New Keynesian model and derivations when allowing for positive
steady-state inflation, including the associated loss function. Section 3 includes our calibration of the
model as well as the results for the optimal rate of inflation while section 4 investigates the robustness of
our results to parameter values. Section 5 then considers extensions of the baseline model which could

4

Fuchi et al (2008) study the optimal inflation rate for Japan allowing for the zero-lower bound on interest rates,
price stickiness, nominal wage rigidity and the opportunity cost of holding money and find a range between 0.5%
and 2%. However, they also do not explicitly take into account the effects of positive steady-state inflation on the
dynamics of the model nor on the utility function approximation.
5
Billi (2009) solves for the optimal policy, including the steady-state inflation rate, under commitment, discretion,
and Taylor rules while we focus only on the latter case in this paper and consider the fully optimal policy under
commitment in a companion paper. While his results under commitment and Taylor rules point to an optimal
inflation rate of under 1%, he argues that under discretion the optimal inflation rate can be as high as 17%.

implications of the model, including price level targeting, while section 7 concludes.

A New Keynesian Model with Positive Steady-State Inflation

We consider a standard New Keynesian model with a representative consumer, a continuum of
monopolistic producers of intermediate goods, a fiscal authority and a central bank.

The representative consumer aims to maximize the present discounted value of the utility stream from
consumption and leisure

where S is the stock of one-period bonds held by the consumer, R is the gross nominal interest rate, P is
the price of the final good, W(i) is the nominal wage earned from labor in industry i, T is transfers and
profits from ownership of firms, q is a risk premium shock, and  is the shadow value of wealth.6 The
first order conditions from this utility-maximization problem are then:

Production of the final good is done by a perfectly competitive sector which combines a continuum of
intermediate goods into a final good per the following aggregator

across intermediate goods, yielding the following demand curve for goods of intermediate sector i

and the following expression for the aggregate price level
/

.

As discussed in Smets and Wouters (2007), a positive shock to q, which is the wedge between the interest rate
controlled by the central bank and the return on assets held by the households, increases the required return on assets
and reduces current consumption. The shock q has similar effects as net-worth shocks in models with financial
accelerators (see Bernanke et al (1999) for a survey).

The production of each intermediate good is done by a monopolist facing a production function

where A denotes the level of technology, common across firms. Each intermediate good producer has

reoptimize its price each period. We allow for indexation of prices to steady-state inflation by firms who
do not reoptimize their prices each period, with ω representing the degree of indexation (0 for no

Steady-state and log-linearization

Following Coibion and Gorodnichenko (2009), we log-linearize the model around the steady-state in
which inflation need not be zero. Since positive trend inflation may imply that the steady state and the
flexible price level of output differ, we adopt the following notational convention. Variables with a bar
denote steady state values, e.g.

is the steady state level of output. We assume that technology is a

random walk and hence we normalize all non-stationary real variables by the level of technology. Lowercase letters denote the log of a variable, e.g.

log

case letters denote deviations from steady state, e.g.

is the log of current output. We let hats on lower
is the approximate percentage deviation

of output from steady state. Since we define the steady state as embodying the current level of

7

technology, deviations from the steady state are stationary. Finally, we denote deviations from the flexible
price level steady state with a tilde, e.g.

is the approximate percentage deviation of output

from its flexible price steady state, where the superscript F denotes a flexible price level quantity. Define
the net steady-state level of inflation as
̂
̂

log Π . The log-linearized consumption Euler equation is

̂

(16)

and the goods market clearing condition becomes
̂
where

and

(17)
are the steady-state ratios of consumption and government to output respectively. Also,

integrating over firm-specific production functions and log-linearizing yields
(18)
Allowing for positive steady-state inflation (i.e.,

0) primarily affects the steady-state and price-

setting components of the model. For example, the steady-state level of the output gap (which is defined
as the deviation of steady state output from its flexible price level counterpart

/

) is given by

/

⁄

/

.

(19)

Note that the steady-state level of the gap is equal to one when steady-state inflation is zero (i.e., Π

1)

or when the degree of price indexation is exactly equal to one. As emphasized by Ascari and Ropele
(2007), there is a non-linear relationship between the steady-state levels of inflation and output. For very
low but positive trend inflation,

is increasing in trend inflation but the sign is quickly reversed so that

is falling with trend inflation for most positive levels of trend inflation.
Secondly, positive steady-state inflation affects the relationship between aggregate inflation and
the re-optimizing price. Specifically, the relationship between the two in the steady state is now given by
/

/

(20)

and the log-linearized equation is described by
(21)
which implies that inflation is less sensitive to changes in the re-optimizing price as steady-state inflation
rises. This effect reflects the fact that, with positive steady-state inflation, firms which reset prices have
higher prices than others and receive a smaller share of expenditures, thereby reducing the sensitivity of
inflation to these price changes. Indexation of prices works to offset this effect however, with fullindexation completely restoring the usual relationship between reset prices and inflation.
Similarly, positive steady-state inflation has important effects on the log-linearized optimal reset
price equation, which is given by

and

inflation or full indexation we have

. When ω < 1, a higher

so that without steady-state

increases the coefficients on future

output and inflation but also leads to the inclusion of a new term composed of future differences between
output growth and interest rates. Each of these effects makes price-setting decisions more forwardlooking.7 The increased coefficient on expectations of future inflation, which reflects the expected future
depreciation of the reset price and the losses associated with it, plays a particularly important role. In
response to an inflationary shock, a firm which can reset its price will expect higher inflation today and in
the future as other firms update their prices. Given this expectation, the higher the trend rate of inflation,
the greater the optimal reset price must be to offset the expected future depreciation in the reset price.
Thus, reset prices become more responsive to shocks with higher . This effect dominates the reduced
sensitivity of inflation to the reset price in equation (21), thereby endogenously generating a positive
relationship between the level and the volatility of inflation.
To close the model, we assume that the log deviation of the desired gross interest rate from its

Welfare function

To quantify welfare for different levels of steady-state inflation, we use a second-order approximation to
the household utility function as in Woodford (2003).8 We show our main results in a series of lemmas
culminating in Proposition 1. All proofs are in Appendix A.
First of all, we decompose utility described in equation (1) into utility due to consumption and
(dis)utility due to labor supply. Lemmas 1 and 2 provide second order approximations for each
component.

.

The key insight from Lemmas 1 and 2 is that welfare is diminished when consumption is low
relative to its flexible-price level and when the cross-sectional dispersion of output is large. To understand
and assess the implications of cross-sectional output dispersion, we need to examine the cross-sectional
dispersion of prices.
Denote the cross-sectional dispersion of prices at time t with ∆

the cross-sectional dispersion of prices in the non-stochastic steady state. It is straightforward to show

In our welfare calculations, we use the second order approximation to the consumer utility function while
structural relationships in the economy are approximated to first order. As discussed in Woodford (2010), this
approach is valid if distortions to the steady state are small so that the first order terms in the utility approximation
are premultiplied by coefficients that can also be treated as first order terms. Since given our parameterization the
distortions from imperfect competition and inflation are small (as in Woodford 2003), this condition is satisfied in
our analysis.

second order as in Woodford (2003) and thus we can use a linear approximation of the structural
relationships in the economy and a second order approximation of consumer utility for welfare
calculations.9 Henceforth, we will treat Γ as approximately zero.
Using the demand condition (7), we can link the cross-sectional dispersion of output to the crosssectional dispersion of prices:

The loss function in Proposition 1 illustrates the three mechanisms via which trend inflation affects
welfare: the steady-state effects, the effects on the coefficients of the utility-function approximation, and
the dynamics of the economy via the second moments of macroeconomic variables.11 First, the term Θ
captures the steady-state effects from positive trend inflation, which hinge on the increase in the crosssectional steady-state dispersion in prices (and therefore in inefficient allocations of resources across
sectors) associated with positive trend inflation.12 Note that as

approaches zero, Θ converges to zero.

10

The complete approximation also contains two linear terms, the expected output gap and expected inflation. Since
the distortions to the steady state are small for the levels of trend inflation we consider, the coefficients that multiply
these terms can be considered as first order so we can evaluate these terms using the first order approximation to the
laws of motion as in Woodford (2003). We confirmed in numeric simulations that they can be ignored.

When
0, equation (41) reduces to the standard second-order approximation of the utility function as in
Proposition 6.4 of Woodford (2003). There is a slight difference between our approximation and the approximation
in Woodford (2003) since we focus on the per-period utility while Woodford calculated the present value.
12
The parameter Ф measures the deviation of the flexible-price level of output from the flexible-price perfectcompetition level of output. See Woodford (2003) for derivation.

As shown by Ascari and Ropele (2009), when

0, Θ /

0, but the sign of the slope quickly

reverses at marginally positive inflation rates. In our baseline calibration, Θ is strictly negative and
Θ /

0 when trend inflation exceeds 0.04% per annum. Thus for quantitatively relevant inflation

rates, the welfare loss from steady-state effects is increasing in the steady-state level of inflation. This is
intuitive since, except for very small levels of inflation, the steady state level of output declines with
higher

because the steady state cross-sectional price dispersion rises. The steady-state cost of inflation

from price dispersion is one of the best-known costs of inflation and arises naturally from the integration
of positive trend inflation into the New Keynesian model. Consistent with this effect being driven by the
increase in dispersion, one can show that the steady-state effect is eliminated with full indexation of
prices and mitigated with partial indexation.
Second, the coefficient on the variance of output around its steady state Θ

0 does not depend

on trend inflation. This term is directly related to the disutility of cross-sectional dispersion of labor
supply. A part of this disutility is brought about by the variance of output around its steady state which is
not a direct function of trend inflation. However, this does not imply that positive

does not impose any

output cost. Rather, trend inflation reduces the steady state level of output, which is already captured by
Θ . Once this is taken into account, then log utility implies that a given level of output variance around
the (new) steady state is as costly as it was before. Furthermore, the variance of output around its steady
state depends on the dynamic properties of the model which are affected by the level of trend inflation.
The coefficient on the variance of inflation Θ

0 captures the sensitivity of the welfare loss due

to the cross-sectional dispersion of prices. One can also show analytically that for

0, Θ /

0 so

that the cross-sectional dispersion of prices becomes ceteris paribus costlier in terms of welfare. Recall
that an inflationary shock creates distortions in relative prices. Given that positive trend inflation already
generates some price dispersion and hence an inefficient allocation of resources, firms operating at an
inefficient level have to compensate workers for the increasingly high marginal disutility of sectorspecific labor. Because of this rising marginal disutility, the increased distortion in relative prices due to
an inflation shock becomes costlier as we increase the initial price dispersion which makes the variance of
inflation costlier for welfare as the trend level of inflation rises. Thus, this is a second, and to the best of
our knowledge previously unidentified, channel through which the price dispersion arising from staggered
price setting under positive inflation reduces welfare. Finally, Θ increases in the Frisch labor supply
elasticity and decreases in the elasticity of substitution across goods  and the Calvo parameter λ.
III

Calibration and Optimal Inflation

Having derived the approximation to the utility function, we now turn to solving for the optimal inflation
rate. Because utility depends on the volatility of macroeconomic variables, this will be a function of the
13

structural parameters and shock processes. Therefore, we first discuss our parameter selection and then
consider the implications for the optimal inflation rate in the model. We investigate the robustness of our
results to parameter values in subsequent sections.
3.1

Parameters

Our baseline parameter values are illustrated in Table 1. For the utility function, we set η, the Frisch labor
supply elasticity, equal to one. The steady-state discount factor β is set to 0.998 to match the real rate of
2.3% per year on 6-month commercial paper or assets with similar short-term maturities given that we set
the steady-state growth rate of real GDP per capita to be 1.5% per year (

1.015

.

), as in Coibion

and Gorodnichenko (2009). We set the elasticity of substitution across intermediate goods θ to 10, so that
steady-state markups are equal to 11%. This size of the markup is consistent with estimates presented in
Burnside (1996) and Basu and Fernald (1997). The degree of price stickiness ( ) is set to 0.55, which
amounts to firms resetting prices approximately every 7 months on average. This is midway between the
micro estimates of Bils and Klenow (2004), who find that firms change prices every 4 to 5 months, and
those of Nakamura and Steinsson (2008), who find that firms change prices every 9 to 11 months.
The degree of price indexation is assumed to be zero in the baseline for three reasons. First, the
workhorse New Keynesian model is based only on price stickiness, making this the most natural
benchmark (Clarida et al (1999), Woodford (2003)). Second, any price indexation implies that firms are
constantly changing prices, a feature strongly at odds with the empirical findings of Bils and Klenow
(2004) and more recently Nakamura and Steinsson (2008), among many others. Third, while indexation
is often included to replicate the apparent role for lagged inflation in empirical estimates of the New
Keynesian Phillips Curve (NKPC; see Gali and Gertler 1999), Cogley and Sbordone (2008) show that
once one controls for steady-state inflation, estimates of the NKPC reject the presence of indexation in
price setting decisions. However, we relax the assumption of no indexation in the robustness checks in
section 4.1.
The coefficients for the Taylor rule are taken from Coibion and Gorodnichenko (2009). These
estimates point to strong long-run responses by the central bank to inflation and output growth (2.5 and
1.5 respectively) and a moderate response to the output gap (0.43).13

The steady-state share of

consumption is set to 0.80 so that the share of government spending is twenty percent. The calibration of
the shocks is primarily taken from the estimated DSGE model of Smets and Wouters (2007) with the
exception of the persistence of the risk premium shocks for which we consider a larger value calibrated at

Because empirical Taylor rules are estimated using annualized rates while the Taylor rule in the model is
= 0.43/4 = 0.11.
expressed at quarterly rates, we rescale the coefficient on the output gap in the model such that

0.94 to match the historical frequency of hitting the zero lower bound and the routinely high persistence
of risk premia in the financial series.14
In our baseline model, positive trend inflation is costly because it leads to more price dispersion
and therefore less efficient allocations, more volatile inflation, and a greater welfare cost for a given
amount of inflation volatility. On the other hand, positive trend inflation gives policy-makers more room
to avoid the ZLB on interest rates. Therefore, a key determinant of the tradeoff between the two depends
on how frequently the ZLB is binding for different levels of trend inflation. To illustrate the implications
of our parameter calibration for how often we hit the ZLB, Figure 1 plots the fraction of time spent at the
ZLB from simulating our model for different steady-state levels of the inflation rate. In addition, we plot
the steady-state level of the nominal interest rate associated with each inflation rate, where the steadystate nominal rate in the model is determined by

·

/ . Our calibration implies that with a steady-

state inflation rate of approximately 3.5%, the average rate for the U.S. since the early 1950’s, the
economy should be at the ZLB approximately 4 percent of the time. With U.S. interest rates at the ZLB
since late 2008 and expected to remain so until at least the end of 2010, this yields a historical frequency
of being at the ZLB of 3.5 percent (i.e. around 2 years out of 60).
In addition, this calibration agrees with the historical changes in interest rates associated with
post-WWII U.S. recessions. For example, starting with the 1958 recession and excluding the current
recession, the average decline in the Federal Funds Rate during a recession has been 4.76 percentage
points.15 The model predicts that the average nominal interest rate with 3.5% steady-state inflation is
around 6%, so the ZLB would not have been binding during the average recession, consistent with the
historical experience. Only the 1981-82 recession led to a decline in nominal interest rates that would
have been sufficiently large to reach the ZLB (8.66% drop in interest rates), but did not because nominal
interest rates and estimates of trend inflation over this period were much higher than their average values.
Thus, with 3-3.5% inflation, our calibration (dotted line in Figure 1) implies that it would take unusually
large recessions for the ZLB to become binding. In addition, our calibration indicates that at much lower
levels of trend inflation , the ZLB would be binding much more frequently. For example, at a zero
steady-state inflation rate, the ZLB would be binding 25% of the time. Given the historical experience of
the U.S., this seems conservative, as it exceeds the historical frequency of recessions. The model predicts
a steady-state level of interest rates of less than 2.5% when

0, and six out the last eight recessions

(again excluding the current episode) were associated with decreases in interest rates that exceeded this
14

This is, for example, consistent with the persistence of the spread between Baa and Aaa bonds which we estimate
to be 0.945 between 1920:1 and 2009:2 and 0.941 between 1950:1 and 2009:2 at the quarterly frequency.

This magnitude is calculated by taking the average level of the fed funds rate (FFR) over the last 6 months prior to
the start of each recession as defined by the NBER and subtracting the minimum level of the FFR reached in the
aftermath of that recession.

value (specifically the 1969, 1973, 1980, 1981, 1990 and 2001 recessions). Our calibration is also largely
in line with the frequency of the ZLB we would have observed given historical declines in nominal
interest rates during recessions and counterfactual levels of trend inflation (broken line in Figure 1).
Thus, we interpret our parameterization as providing a reasonable representation of the likelihood of
hitting the ZLB for different inflation rates given the historical experience of the U.S.
3.2

Optimal Inflation

Having derived the dynamics of the model, parameterized the shocks, and obtained the second-order
approximation to the utility function, we now simulate the model for different levels of trend inflation
and compute expected utility for each . The results taking into account the ZLB and in the case when
we ignore the ZLB are plotted in Panel A of Figure 2. Note first that, when the ZLB is not taken into
account, the optimal rate of inflation is zero because there are only costs to inflation and no benefits.16
Figure 2 also plots the other extreme when we include the ZLB but do not take into account the effects of
positive steady-state inflation on the loss function or the dynamics of the model. In this case, there are no
costs to inflation so utility is strictly increasing as steady-state inflation rises and the frequency of the
ZLB diminishes. Our key result is the specification which incorporates both the costs and benefits of
inflation. As a result of the presence of the ZLB, we find that utility is increasing at very low levels of
inflation so that that zero inflation is not optimal when the zero bound is present. Second, the peak level
of utility is reached when the inflation rate is 1.1% at an annualized rate. This is at the bottom end of the
target range of most central banks, which are commonly between 1% and 3%. Thus, our baseline results
imply that taking into account the zero bound on interest rates raises the optimal level of inflation, but
with no additional benefits to inflation included in the model, the optimal inflation rate is within the
standard range of inflation targets. Third, inflation rates above the optimal level monotonically lower
utility. Fourth, the costs of even moderate inflation can be nontrivial. For example, a 4% annualized
inflation rate would lower utility by nearly 2% relative to the optimal level, which given log utility in
consumption is equivalent to a permanent 2% decrease in the level of consumption.
In addition, Panel B of Figure 2 quantifies the importance of each of the three costs of inflation –
the steady state effect, the increasing cost of inflation volatility, and the positive link between the level
and volatility of inflation – by calculating the optimal inflation rate subject to the zero lower bound when
only one of these costs, in turn, is included. The first finding to note is that allowing for any of the three
inflation costs is sufficient to bring the optimal inflation rate to 2.5% or below. Thus, all three inflation
costs incorporated in the model are individually large enough to prevent the ZLB from pushing the
optimal inflation rate above the current target range of most central banks. Second, the steady-state cost
16

We determine optimal inflation in a grid-space with a width of 0.04% per year. It is therefore possible, although
quantitatively not important, that the optimal inflation rate without the ZLB is positive but less than 0.04% per year.

16

of price dispersion is the largest cost of inflation out of the three, bringing the optimal inflation rate down
to 1.3% by itself.
To get a sense of which factors drive these results, the top row of Figure 3 plots the coefficients
of the second-order approximation to the utility function from Proposition 1. In short, the results confirm
the analytical derivations in section 2.4. First, rising inflation has important negative steady-state effects
on utility, as the increasing price dispersion inefficiently lowers the steady-state level of production and
consumption. For example, 6% inflation lowers utility by nearly 4% relative to zero inflation via the
steady-state effects.
independent of

Second, the coefficient on the variance of output around its steady state is

even though the new steady state level of output is lower. This reflects our assumption

of log-utility in consumption. Third, the coefficient on inflation variance is decreasing in , i.e., holding
the inflation variance constant, higher

raises the utility cost of the variance in inflation. This reflects the

fact that when the steady state level of price dispersion is already high then a temporary increase in price
dispersion due to higher or lower inflation is even more costly. Moving from zero inflation to six percent
inflation raises the coefficient on inflation variance by over 40% in absolute value. Thus, as

rises,

policy-makers should place an increasing weight on the variance of inflation relative to the variance of the
output gap.
The middle row of Figure 3 plots the effects of

on the variance of inflation and the output gap,

i.e. the dynamic effects of steady-state inflation and the zero bound on interest rates. In addition, we plot
the corresponding moments in the absence of the zero-bound on interest rates to characterize the
contribution of the zero-bound on macroeconomic dynamics. A notable feature of the figure is that
output volatility rises much more rapidly as

falls when the ZLB is present. Intuitively, the ZLB is hit

more often at a low . With the nominal rate fixed at zero the central bank cannot stabilize the economy
by cutting interest rates further and thus macroeconomic volatility increases. As we increase
macroeconomic volatility (especially for output) diminishes. This is the benefit of higher

,

in the model.

The effect of changes in , however, is non-linear for the variance of inflation when we take into
account the zero-bound on interest rates. At low levels of inflation, increasing

reduces the volatility of

inflation for the same reason as for output: the reduced frequency of hitting the zero bound. On the other
hand, higher

also tends to make price-setting decisions more forward-looking, so that, absent the zero

bound, inflation volatility is consistently rising with

, a feature emphasized in Kiley (2007) and

consistent with a long literature documenting a positive relationship between the level and variance of
inflation (Okun (1971), Taylor (1981) and Kiley (2000)). When

rises past a specific value, the latter

effect starts to dominate and the variance of inflation begins to rise with . Given our baseline values,
this switch occurs at an annualized trend inflation rate of approximately 2.5%. These results show the
importance of modeling both the zero-bound and the effects of

on the dynamics of the model.
17

The bottom row of Figure 3 then plots the contribution of these different effects on the welfare
costs of inflation, i.e. each of the terms in Proposition 1. These include the steady-state effects of
well as the interaction of the effects of

as

on the coefficients of the utility function approximation and the

dynamics of the economy. The most striking result is that the welfare costs and benefits of positive

are

essentially driven by only two components: the steady-state effect and the contribution of inflation
variance to utility. In particular, the U-shape pattern of the inflation variance combined with decreasing
Θ plays the key role in delivering a positive level of the optimal inflation rate, while the effects of the
ZLB on the contribution of the output gap variability are an order of magnitude smaller and therefore play
a limited role in determining the optimal inflation rate.
3.3

Are the costs of business cycles and the ZLB too small in the model?

The minor contribution of output gap volatility to the optimal inflation rate might be interpreted as an
indication that the model understates the costs of business cycles in general and the ZLB in particular.
For the former, the implied welfare costs of business cycles in our model are approximately 1.5% of
steady-state consumption at the optimal inflation rate, in line with DeLong and Summers (1988), Barlevy
(2004), and much larger than in Lucas (1987). To assess the cost of hitting the ZLB, we compute the
average welfare loss net of steady-state effects from simulating the model under different inflation rates
both with and without the zero bound. The difference between the two provides a measure of the
additional welfare cost of business cycles due to the presence of the ZLB. We can then divide this cost by
the average frequency of being at the zero bound from our simulations, for each level of steady-state
inflation, to get a per-quarter average welfare loss measure conditional on being at the ZLB which is
plotted in Figure 4. With a steady-state inflation rate of zero, the average cost of a quarter spent at the
ZLB is equivalent to a permanent 3.5% reduction in consumption. As steady-state inflation rises, this
per-period cost declines because the average duration of ZLB episodes gets shorter and the output losses
during the ZLB are increasing non-linearly with the duration of the ZLB (see Christiano et al (2009)). At
a steady-state inflation rate of 3%, the average per-quarter cost of the ZLB is approximately equal to a
permanent 0.5% reduction in consumption. The additional cost conditional on being restrained by the
zero lower bound on interest rates for 8 quarters would then exceed a permanent 4% reduction in
consumption, or $400 billion per year based on 2008 consumption data.17,18 For comparison, Williams

17

In this calculation, we treat as negligible the fact that in our model the presence of the ZLB can reduce the average
level of output because the product of the average reduction in output, the frequency of hitting the ZLB and the
utility weight on the first order term corresponding to the output gap is small. However, conditional on hitting the
ZLB, the reduction in output could be substantial. For example, the average per-quarter reduction in output when the
ZLB is binding at three percent trend inflation is about one percent. Assuming the binding ZLB lasts for eight
quarters, the fall in output is then worth $1.2 trillion dollars over 2 years, or 33% more than Williams’ (2009)
estimate.

18

(2009) uses the Federal Reserve’s FRB/US model to estimate that the ZLB between 2009 and 2010 cost
$1.8 trillion in lost output over four years, or roughly $300 billion per year in lost consumption over four
years if one assumes that the decline in consumption was proportional to the decline in output. Thus, the
costs of both business cycles and the ZLB in the model cannot be described as being uncharacteristically
small.
3.4

How does optimal inflation depend on the coefficient on the variance of the output gap?

The fact that the large decline in the volatility of the output gap associated with the decreased frequency
of hitting the ZLB as steady state inflation rises has so little effect on optimal inflation reflects the small
relative weight assigned to output gap fluctuations in the utility function. At

0, the coefficient on the

output gap variance in the loss function is less than one-hundredth that on the quarterly inflation variance
(or one-tenth for the annualized inflation variance), and this difference becomes even more pronounced as
rises. The low optimal weight on output gap volatility is standard in New Keynesian models (see
Woodford (2003)) and could reflect the lack of involuntary unemployment, which causes substantial
hardship to a small fraction of the population and whose welfare effects may therefore be poorly
approximated by changes in aggregate consumption and employment, or the absence of distributional
considerations, since business cycles disproportionately affect low income/wealth individuals who are
likely to have higher marginal utilities of consumption than the average consumer.19
To assess how sensitive the optimal inflation rate is to the coefficient on the output gap variance,
we increase this coefficient by a factor ranging from 1 to 100 and reproduce our results for the optimal
inflation rate for each factor (see Figure 4). As expected, raising the coefficient on the variance of the
output gap pushes the optimal inflation rate higher. However, the coefficient on the output gap variance
needs to be strikingly large to qualitatively affect our findings. For example, much of the traditional
literature on optimal monetary policy assumed an equal weight on output and annualized inflation
variances in the loss function. With inflation being measured at an annualized rate, this equal weighting
obtains at zero steady-state inflation when Θ1 is multiplied by a factor of approximately 10. Yet this
weighting would push the optimal inflation rate up only modestly, to less than 1.4% per year.
Raising the optimal inflation rate substantially above 2.5% would require increasing the
coefficient on output gap variance in the loss function by around 100, thereby making the weight placed
on output volatility approximately ten times as large as that on annualized inflation volatility, a weighting
scheme which seems difficult to justify. Furthermore, such a loss function would imply that the costs of
business cycles are equivalent to a permanent drop in consumption of 10% when evaluated at the optimal
18

In our baseline calibration, the 90% confidence interval for the duration of ZLB episodes is (2,12) at 3.5%

19

inflation rate, which is much larger than commonly found in the literature. Finally, placing such weight
on output volatility would also substantially increase the per-quarter cost of having the ZLB bind.
Evaluated at the optimal inflation rate, each quarter with a binding ZLB would lower utility by an average
amount equivalent to a 5% permanent reduction in consumption, such that an episode of 8 consecutive
quarters at the ZLB would deliver welfare losses equivalent to roughly 40% of steady-state consumption,
above and beyond the costs of the shock in the absence of the ZLB. Thus, while one can mechanically
raise the optimal inflation rate by appealing to larger weights on output fluctuations than implied by the
model, weighting schemes which meaningfully raise the optimal inflation rate will point to welfare costs
of business cycles, and particularly episodes at the ZLB, that depart from the conventional wisdom.
IV

Robustness of the Optimal Inflation Rate to Alternative Parameter Values

In this section, we investigate the robustness of the optimal inflation rate to our parameterization of the
model. We focus particularly on the pricing parameters, the discount factor, and the risk premium
shock.20
4.1

Pricing Parameters

Figure 5 plots the utility-approximation for different levels of

for alternative pricing parameters, as well

as the optimal inflation rates associated with these parameter values. First, we consider the role of the
elasticity of substitution θ. Note that the welfare costs of inflation are larger when θ is high. This result
captures the fact that a higher elasticity of substitution generates more real rigidity and therefore more
persistence in fluctuations, thereby raising the welfare cost of fluctuations for any
effects of this parameter on the optimal

. However, the

are relatively small: using a value of θ = 5, half of our baseline

and an upper bound on how big markups are in the economy, raises the optimal

to about 1.6% from our

baseline of 1.1%. This is well within the range of inflation targets employed by modern central banks.
We also investigate the role of price indexation. In our baseline, we assumed ω = 0, based on the
fact that firms do not change prices every period in the data, as documented by Bils and Klenow (2004)
and Nakamura and Steinsson (2008), as well as the results of Cogley and Sbordone (2008) who argue that
once one controls for time-varying trend inflation, we cannot reject the null that ω = 0 for the US.
However, because price-indexation is such a common component of New Keynesian models, we consider
the effects of price indexation on our results. Figure 5 indicates that higher levels of indexation lead to
higher optimal rates of inflation because indexation reduces the dispersion of prices. Yet with ω = 0.5,

20

We also investigated the sensitivity of our results to the Frisch labor supply elasticity and other parameters. These
had minor quantitative effects on our results; we omit them from the text in the interest of space. We also added
habit formation to the model and found that this had little effect on the optimal inflation rate.

20

which is most likely an upper bound for an empirically plausible degree of indexation in low-inflation
economies like the U.S., the optimal

remains less than 2%.

Third, we investigate the effects of price stickiness. Our baseline calibration, λ = 0.55, is midway
between the findings of Bils and Klenow (2004) of median price durations of 4-5 months and those of
Nakamura and Steinsson (2008) of median price durations of 9-11 months. We now consider values of λ
ranging from 0.50 to 0.65. There is little impact on welfare for very low levels of inflation, but as the
steady state inflation rate rises past 3%, higher degrees of price stickiness are associated with much larger
welfare losses than the baseline.21 This reflects the fact that with more price stickiness, price dispersion is
greater, and this effect is amplified at higher levels of steady-state inflation, thereby generating much
larger welfare losses. Nonetheless, this has only minor effects on the optimal inflation rate.
4.2

Discount Factor and Risk Premium Shocks

We also consider the sensitivity of our results to the discount factor and the parameters governing the risk
premium shocks. First, we reproduce our baseline welfare figure for different levels of the persistence to
risk premium shocks. The results are quite sensitive to this parameter, which reflects the fact that these
shocks play a crucial role in hitting the zero lower bound. For example, Figure 6 illustrates that when we
raise the persistence of the shock from 0.94 to 0.96, the optimal inflation rate rises from 1.2% to 2.7%
because this increase in the persistence of the shock has a large effect on the frequency and duration of
being at the ZLB. At 3.5% inflation, this frequency more than doubles relative to our baseline scenario,
thereby raising the benefit of higher steady-state inflation. The reverse occurs with lower persistence of
risk premium shocks: the frequency of being at the ZLB declines sharply as does the optimal inflation
rate. Second, similar results obtain when we vary the volatility of the risk premium shock. When we
increase the standard deviation of these shocks to 0.0035 from our baseline of 0.0024, the optimal
inflation rate again rises to slightly over two percent. As with the persistence of the shocks, this is driven
by a higher frequency of being at the ZLB: at 3.5% inflation, this alternative shock volatility implies the
economy would be at the ZLB more than twice as often as under our baseline calibration.
Third, we consider the sensitivity of our results to the steady-state level of the discount factor β.
This parameter is also important in determining the frequency at which the economy is at the ZLB since it
affects the steady-state level of nominal interest rates. This is particularly important at low levels of .
As with the risk premium shock variables, a higher value of β is associated with a lower steady-state level
of nominal interest rates, so that the ZLB will be binding more frequently. For example, with β=0.9999
(which corresponds to a real rate of 1.54% per year), the ZLB is binding approximately 6% of the time

In fact, if we increase λ above 0.65 the model starts to run into indeterminacy regions which are potentially
associated with unbounded volatility.
21

21

when steady-state inflation is 3.5%. At the maximum, however, the optimal

is only 0.5% higher than

implied by our baseline results.
These robustness checks clearly illustrate how important the frequency at which the economy hits
the ZLB is for our results. Naturally, parameter changes which make the ZLB binding more often raise
the optimal rate of inflation because a higher

lowers the frequency of hitting the ZLB. Thus, the key

point is not the specific values chosen for these parameters but rather having a combination of them that
closely reproduces the historical frequency of hitting the ZLB for the U.S. In any case, even if we
consider parameter values that double the frequency of hitting the ZLB at the historical average rate of
inflation for the U.S., the optimal inflation rate rises only to about 2-2.5%, which is still well within the
target range of most central banks.
V

What Could Raise the Optimal Inflation Rate?

While our baseline model emphasizes the tradeoff between higher trend inflation to ensure against the
zero-bound on nominal interest rates versus the utility costs associated with higher trend inflation,
previous research has identified additional factors beyond the lower-bound on nominal interest rates
which might lead to higher levels of optimal inflation. In this section, we extend our analysis to assess
their quantitative importance. First, we include capital formation in the model. Second, we allow for
uncertainty about parameter values on the part of policy-makers. Third, we consider the possibility that
the degree of price stickiness varies with . Fourth, we explore whether our results are sensitive to using
Taylor pricing. Fifth, we integrate downward nominal wage rigidity, i.e. “greasing the wheels,” into the
model.
5.1

Capital

First, we consider how sensitive our results are to the introduction of capital. We present a detailed model
in Appendix B and only provide a verbal description in this section. In this model, firms produce output
with a Cobb-Douglas technology (capital share

0.33). All capital goods are homogeneous and can be

equally well employed by all firms. Capital is accumulated by the representative consumer subject to a
quadratic adjustment cost to capital (

3 as in Woodford (2003)) and rented out in a perfectly

competitive rental market. The aggregate capital stock depreciates at rate

0.02 per quarter. We

calculate the new steady state level of output relative to the flexible price level output and derive the
analogue of Proposition 1 in Appendix B with proofs in Appendix C.
By allowing capital to freely move between firms we reduce the steady state welfare cost from
trend inflation. Now firms that have a relatively low price can hire additional capital rather than sectorspecific workers to boost their output. Thus the disutility of labor does not increase by as much as it did in
the labor-only model and this will be a force to raise the optimal inflation level. However, capital also
22

reduces the likelihood of hitting the ZLB. Unlike the labor-only model, including capital permits positive
savings and so we are less likely to be in a situation where an increase in qt pushes interest rates to zero.
This channel will lower the optimal inflation rate in the capital model relative to the labor-only model.
0.93 to match the historical frequency at the ZLB. As shown

We isolate the first channel by setting

in Figure 7, utility peaks at a trend inflation rate of 1.7% per annum suggesting that capital does not lower
the cost of inflation substantially, yielding only a small net increase in the optimal inflation rate.
5.2

Model Uncertainty

An additional feature that could potentially lead to higher rates of optimal inflation is uncertainty about
the model on the part of policy-makers.

If some plausible parameter values lead to much higher

frequencies of hitting the ZLB or raise the output costs of being at the ZLB, then policy-makers might
want to insure against these outcomes by allowing for a higher . To quantify this notion, we consider
two exercises.

First, we identify

that maximizes expected utility taking into account parameter

uncertainty. Second, we generate a distribution of optimal

from the distribution of parameters.

Our starting point for both exercises is uncertainty about the parameters of the model. We
characterize this uncertainty via the variance-covariance matrix of the estimated parameters from Smets
and Wouters (2007). We place an upper bound on parameter values to eliminate draws where the ZLB
binds unrealistically often, in excess of 10% at 6% annual trend inflation. To assess the optimal inflation
rate given uncertainty about parameter values, we compute the expected utility associated with each level
of steady-state inflation by repeatedly drawing from the distribution of parameter values.22 Figure 8
(Panel A) plots the implied levels of expected utility associated with each steady-state level of inflation.
Maximum utility is achieved with an inflation rate of 1.4% per year. As expected, this is higher than our
baseline result, which reflects the fact that some parameter draws lead to much larger costs of being at the
zero-bound, a feature which also leads to a much more pronounced inverted U-shape of the welfare losses
from steady-state inflation. Nonetheless, this optimal rate of inflation remains well within the bounds of
current inflation targets of modern central banks.23
Secondly, for each draw from the parameter space, we solve for the optimal inflation rate, thereby
allowing us to characterize the uncertainty associated with our baseline results. Figure 8 (Panel B) plots
the distribution function of these inflation rates. The 90% confidence interval of optimal inflation rates
ranges from 0.1% to 2.2% per year, which again is very close to the target range for inflation of most

22

Note that some parameter draws yield an indeterminate solution. In this case, we solve for the dynamics using the
“continuous” solution as in Lubik and Schorfheide (2003).
23
Billi (2009) considers the effects of parameter uncertainty on the optimal inflation rate via robust control methods
and also finds that parameter uncertainty raises the optimal inflation rate slightly.

23

central banks. In short, incorporating model uncertainty confirms our baseline finding that, even after
taking into account the ZLB, the optimal inflation rate is low and close to current targeted levels.
5.3

Endogenous Price Stickiness

In our baseline analysis, we treat the degree of price rigidity as a structural parameter. However, theory
implies that the cost to firms of not changing prices should increase as

rises (Romer 1990). Higher

levels of inflation should therefore be associated with lower levels of price stickiness, which would tend
to lower the welfare costs of positive trend inflation. Thus, by ignoring this endogeneity, we might be
overstating the costs of positive inflation and thereby underestimating the optimal rate of inflation.
The empirical evidence on the sensitivity of price rigidity to the inflation rate is mixed. Gagnon
(2009), for example, finds a statistically significant relationship between the inflation rate and the
frequency of price changes for Mexico, but only when the inflation rate exceeds 10% per year. Dhyne et
al (2005) find a positive relationship between the two for a cross-section of European countries, but the
relationship is not statistically significantly different from zero once they control for a variety of other
factors. Nakamura and Steinsson (2008) similarly estimate the relationship between annual inflation and
the frequency of price changes using micro-level US data and find only mixed evidence in favor of a
statistically significant link between the two.
Despite the absence of a strong empirical link between price stickiness and the steady state level
of inflation (at least for plausible U.S. levels of inflation), we consider the sensitivity of our baseline
results to a possible systematic link between the two. Specifically, we follow Nakamura and Steinsson’s
empirical approach and posit a linear relationship between the (monthly) frequency of price changes and
the steady state annual rate of inflation, with the coefficient on inflation denoted by βπ. The average
estimate of Nakamura and Steinsson across price measures and time periods is approximately βπ = 0.5,
and the upper bound of their confidence intervals is approximately βπ = 1. We reproduce our analysis
using these values, as well as our baseline assumption of βπ = 0, and plot the results in Figure 9.24 In each
case, we calibrate the degree of price rigidity such that λ=0.55 (our baseline value) at a steady-state level
of annual inflation of 3.5%.
Panel A shows the implied variation in the degree of price stickiness. For the mean estimated
degree of endogeneity from Nakamura and Steinsson (2008), the average duration between price changes
24

To be clear, we allow the degree of price stickiness to vary with the steady-state rate of inflation, but not with
fluctuations in the inflation rate around its steady-state value. An alternative approach would be to model
endogenous price setting via “menu” costs. Although we do not consider this approach explicitly here, one would
expect two opposing effects on the optimal inflation rate from such an extension. First, paying the fixed costs of
changing prices would lower welfare, and this cost would be rising with steady-state inflation as firms would reset
their prices more often. On the other hand, because of selection effects, price dispersion should rise less rapidly
with inflation than under time-dependent pricing models, as emphasized in Burstein and Hellwig (2008). It is
unclear, ex ante, which effect would dominate.

24

varies from eight months to six months, while the upper bound on endogeneity of price stickiness yields
durations ranging from nine months to five and a half months. Panel B shows that the frequency of
hitting the ZLB varies little across specifications: for a given inflation rate, a higher frequency of price
changes is associated with larger movements in inflation (and therefore hitting the ZLB more frequently)
but these changes are less persistent (so the economy exits the ZLB more rapidly), leaving the overall
frequency of being at the ZLB largely unchanged across specifications. Panels C-F demonstrate the
effects of endogeneity on the optimal inflation rate and the utility associated with different levels of
steady-state inflation. First, the optimal inflation rate is remarkably insensitive to endogenous price
stickiness, falling only to slightly less than 1.0% at the maximum sensitivity of price stickiness to steadystate inflation. Second, the welfare costs of inflation at the optimal rate are rising with endogenous price
setting. This reflects the fact that, given the same low optimal rate of inflation, more endogeneity is
associated with higher degrees of price stickiness and therefore a higher cost of inflation. Third, despite
the fact that the optimal rate of inflation varies little with endogenous price stickiness, the costs of much
higher

are significantly lower relative to our baseline, because higher inflation leads to more frequent

price changes and therefore less price dispersion in the steady state.
5.4

Taylor pricing

An alternative approach to Calvo pricing is the staggered contracts approach of Taylor (1977) in which
firms set prices for a pre-determined duration of time. This pricing assumption can loosely be thought of
as a lower bound on forward-looking behavior (conditional on price durations) since it imposes zero
weight on expected profits beyond those of the contract length in the firm’s reset price optimization. The
derivation of the utility approximation as well as the structural log-linearized equations of the model is
similar to Calvo pricing (Appendix D contains details for the utility approximation when the duration of
price spells is equal to three quarters).
Figure 10 compares the results under Taylor pricing (duration of price contracts equal to 3 and 4
quarters) with the results from Calvo pricing. The optimal inflation rates for the Taylor model are 1.4 and
1.1 percent per year for price durations of 3 and 4 quarters respectively, which is close to the 1.1 percent
per year found for the baseline Calvo model. Note also that the volatility of inflation and the output gap
(Panels C and D) as well as the frequency of hitting ZLB (Panel B) are approximately the same in all
models. However, the Taylor model has smaller welfare losses as

increases above 2 percent per year.

For example, the welfare loss at the steady state inflation of 6 percent per year relative to the minimum
loss is about 4 percent in the Calvo model but only about 1-2 percent in the Taylor model (Panel A). The
key source of this difference is that the Taylor model assigns smaller steady state effects (Panel E) and a

25

lower weight on inflation variability (Panel F) than the Calvo model does.25 Intuitively, since firms under
Calvo pricing may be stuck with a suboptimal price for a long time, the cost of positive steady state
inflation is larger than in the Taylor model where firms are guaranteed to change prices in a fixed number
of periods. In summary, although both the Taylor and Calvo models yield similar optimal inflation rates,
these models provide different estimates of welfare gains from low steady state inflation.
5.5

Downward Wage Rigidity

A common motivation for positive trend inflation, beside the zero-lower bound and seigniorage, is the
“greasing the wheels” effect raised by Tobin (1972). If wages are downwardly rigid, as usually found in
the data (e.g., Dickens et al 2007), then positive trend inflation will facilitate the downward-adjustment of
real wages required to adjust to negative shocks. To quantify the effects of downward nominal wage
rigidity in our model, we integrate it in a manner analogous to the zero-bound on interest rates by
imposing that changes in the aggregate nominal wage index be above a minimum bound
∆
where ∆
and ∆

max ∆

,∆

is the change in wages that would occur in the absence of the zero-bound on nominal wages
is the lower-bound on nominal wage changes. Note that even with zero steady-state inflation,

steady-state nominal wages grow at the rate of technological progress. Thus, we set ∆

to be equal to

minus the sum of the growth rate of technology and the steady state rate of inflation.
Figure 11 presents the utility associated with different steady-state inflation rates under both the
zero-bound on interest rates and downward-wage rigidity. The result is striking: the optimal inflation rate
falls to zero with downward wage rigidity. The reason for this counterintuitive finding is illustrated in
Panel B of Figure 11. With downward wage rigidity, marginal costs are much less volatile, so the
variance of inflation is substantially reduced relative to the case with flexible wages. In addition, the fact
that marginal costs are downwardly rigid means that, in the face of a negative demand shock, inflation
will decline by less and therefore interest rates will fall less, reducing the frequency of the ZLB. With
0, the ZLB binds approximately 10 percent of the time with downward wage rigidity but over 25
percent of the time with flexible wages. This decrease in the frequency of binding ZLB at low

reduces

26

the benefit of higher trend inflation and leads to lower estimates of the optimal inflation rate.
VI

Normative Implications

We have so far been treating the question of the optimal inflation rate independently of the systematic
response of the central bank to macroeconomic fluctuations. In this section, we consider the sensitivity of

25

The coefficient on the output variability is the same in the Taylor and Calvo models.
Kim and Ruge-Murcia (2009) similarly find that downward wage rigidity, by itself, has little positive effect on the

our baseline results to alternative coefficients for the central bank’s response function as well as the
normative question of how the central bank can optimize over both optimal inflation and its systematic
response to the economy.
6.1

Taylor Rule Parameters

Our baseline Taylor rule parameters are taken from Coibion and Gorodnichenko (2009) based on the
post-1982 era. However, as has been emphasized in the empirical literature on central banks’ reaction
functions, there is robust evidence of time-variation in the Federal Reserve’s systematic response to
economic fluctuations.27 In addition, like the steady-state inflation rate, the reaction function is under the
control of policymakers so we are interested in studying the interaction of these policy variables on
welfare. Thus, we consider the implications of alternative parameter values in the Taylor rule, illustrated
in Figure 12. First, we consider long-run responses to inflation by the central bank ranging from 2 to 5.
The effects on welfare are unambiguous: stronger long-run responses to inflation raise welfare in the
model for all inflation rates. Intuitively, this stronger systematic response reduces inflation and output
volatility, thereby leading to a lower frequency of being at the ZLB and higher utility. However, this has
little effect on the optimal inflation rate, which ranges from 1.2% when

2 to 0.9% when

5.

We also investigate the sensitivity to the central bank’s response to the real side of the economy
via output growth or output gap. We find that stronger responses to output growth generally lower
welfare while higher responses to output gap are welfare-improving. This finding is interesting for two
reasons. First, Orphanides (2003) and Coibion and Gorodnichenko (2009) emphasize that one of the
primary changes in U.S. monetary policy around the time of the Volcker disinflation was the switch from
responding aggressively to the gap toward responding more aggressively to the growth rate of output.
One advantage of the latter is that output growth is readily observable whereas the output gap is likely to
be subject to much more real-time measurement error, as documented in Orphanides and van Nordern
(2002). However, our results indicate that responding strongly to output growth actually reduces welfare
in a New Keynesian model. Second, Coibion and Gorodnichenko (2009) show that responding to the
output gap can be destabilizing in New Keynesian models under positive steady-state inflation because it
can lead to indeterminacy. Responding to output growth, on the other hand, helps achieve determinacy
for smaller responses to inflation when steady-state inflation is positive. Figure 12 indicates that
conditional on staying in the determinacy region the welfare results go in the other direction. Hence,
there is a tradeoff between the two measures in terms of stabilization: responding to the (properly
measured) gap is welfare improving as long as the economy remains in the determinacy region, but
increases the likelihood of switching to an indeterminate equilibrium with the possibility of sunspot

27

fluctuations. Responding to the growth rate of output moves the economy away from the indeterminacy
region but leads to lower welfare within the indeterminacy region. However, in terms of the optimal
inflation rate, the distinction is minor and neither measure has much quantitative importance in
determining the optimal inflation rate within the determinacy region of the parameter space.
6.2

Price-Level Targeting, the Zero Bound, and the Optimal Inflation Rate

While our baseline specification of the Taylor rule restricts the endogenous response of the central bank
to inflation and the real side of the economy, an additional factor sometimes considered is price-level
targeting (PLT). While the evidence for central banks actually following PLT remains scarce, PLT has
nonetheless received substantial attention in the literature for several reasons. First, as emphasized in
Woodford (2003), PLT guarantees determinacy under zero trend inflation for any positive response to the
price level gap. Second, Coibion and Gorodnichenko (2009) show that PLT ensures determinacy for
positive steady-state inflation rates as well, and is not subject to the deterioration of the Taylor principle
as a result of positive trend inflation which occurs when the central bank responds only to inflation.
Third, Gorodnichenko and Shapiro (2007) show that PLT robustly helps stabilize inflation expectations,
thereby yielding smaller inflation and output volatility than would occur in inflation-targeting regimes.
We extend our baseline model to include PLT in the central bank’s reaction function (
Figure 13 which shows the effects of PLT on welfare for different

0) in

as well as its implications for the

optimal rate of inflation. First, PLT strictly increases welfare for any . Second, PLT leads to much
lower levels of optimal inflation than inflation-targeting regimes. Even for moderate responses to the
price level gap, the optimal level of inflation is less than 0.1 percent per year, which is close to the zero
optimal inflation rate in the Ramsey problem under commitment where we do not impose constraints on
policy reaction function.28 This magnitude practically means price level stability (rather than inflation
stability) which is, in fact, the mandated objective for most central banks.
The intuition for why PLT delivers such a small optimal inflation rate is straightforward. First, as
observed in Gorodnichenko and Shapiro (2007), PLT stabilizes expectations and has a profound effect on
output and inflation volatility. In our simulations, the reduction in inflation and output volatility is so
substantial that the welfare costs of inflation are almost exclusively driven by the steady-state effects. As
a result of reduced volatility, the ZLB binds less frequently. For example, with

0.3, the ZLB binds

less than two percent of the time at a steady-state level of inflation of 3.5%. Second, even if the nominal
rate hits zero, the policy rule remains a potent factor in stimulating the economy despite the ZLB because

28

The Ramsey problem under commitment seeks the welfare maximizing policy subject to commitment constraints
and structural relationships in the economy. In our analysis, the objective function for the Ramsey problem is the
sum of the approximation given in Proposition 1 and a penalty for interest rate variability calibrated at 0.077 Θ as
in Woodford (2003). See Coibion et al (2010) for more details.

28

agents know that the deflationary pressures during the ZLB will have to be offset by above-average
inflation in the future. This limits the downward movement in inflationary expectations and therefore the
associated increase in real interest rates. In short, PLT limits the extent of deflationary spirals so that the
exit from a ZLB episode occurs more rapidly and the welfare costs of the ZLB are substantially reduced.
To give a sense of the magnitude of the associated welfare change, we note that by increasing

from

zero to 0.25 (combined with the appropriate change in the optimal rate of inflation), a policymaker could
raise welfare by the equivalent to a permanent increase in consumption of 1.5 percent and approach the
welfare gains for the optimal policy in the Ramsey problem under commitment (see Figure 13). Thus,
these results provide a new justification for the consideration of PLT by monetary policymakers.
In addition, we consider a closely related issue: the degree of interest smoothing. Coibion and
Gorodnichenko (2009) observe that PLT is very similar to a policy rule with high inertia, i.e.,
close to one.29 For simplicity, we abstract from the AR(2) interest-smoothing commonly found in
empirical studies and instead restrict our attention to AR(1) interest smoothing: i.e. we set the AR(1)
coefficient in the interest rate smoothing polynomial equal to

and the AR(2) coefficient to zero.

Figure 13 confirms that, like PLT, higher interest rate smoothing leads to lower levels of optimal steadystate inflation because it reduces the incidence and damage of hitting the ZLB and therefore lowers the
optimal inflation rate.30 However, unlike PLT, this decrease in the optimal inflation rate is associated
with lower welfare after

passes 0.89. The inverted U-shape of the welfare results from the

tradeoff between strong short-run and strong long-run responses to endogenous variables implied by our
Taylor rule specification (26) since we hold the long-run responses to inflation, output gap and output
growth rate constant in this experiment but, by raising

VII

, decrease the short run response.

Concluding remarks

If nothing else, the Great Recession has taught monetary economists one lesson: the zero bound is not a
theoretical curiosity of interest only to historians of the Great Depression or as a precautionary tale
against overly cautious policy-makers such as the Japanese monetary and fiscal authorities in the early
1990s. Instead, the pervasiveness of the zero bound constraint among major industrial countries has
demonstrated the necessity of incorporating this issue into modern macroeconomic models. Indeed, the
recent interest in raising the inflation targets of central banks has resurrected a basic question for
macroeconomists: what is the optimal inflation rate? Strikingly, New Keynesian models, with their

29

Specifically, a Taylor rule with only PLT is observationally equivalent to a super-inertial Taylor rule that responds
to contemporaneous inflation. More generally, a Taylor rule with “partial” PLT in which the central bank pushes
prices only partly back to the initial target path is observationally equivalent to a Taylor rule with interest smoothing
and a contemporaneous response to inflation. See Coibion and Gorodnichenko (2009) for more details.
30
Billi (2009) similarly finds that higher interest smoothing lowers the optimal rate of inflation.

29

pervasive reliance on the assumption of zero steady-state inflation, have been ill-equipped to answer this
key question for central bankers.
We provide an integrated treatment of the effects of non-zero steady-state inflation in New
Keynesian models.

Most importantly, we derive an approximation to the utility function of the

representative agent which incorporates the various dimensions along which steady-state inflation
matters: the steady-state, the dynamics of the model, and the coefficients of the utility-function
approximation. This allows us to study the optimal rate of inflation using a welfare criterion derived
explicitly from the microfoundations of the model. Combining this with the zero-bound on nominal
interest rates, we are then able to study the costs and benefits of steady-state inflation and quantify the
optimal rate of inflation in the model. Our baseline result is that this optimal rate of inflation is fairly
low: less than two percent a year.

We show that this result is robust to a variety of parameter

specifications and modifications of the model.
Given that most central banks are targeting inflation rates between 1% and 3% a year, our results
can be interpreted as supporting the current regimes and providing little evidence in favor of raising these
targets to provide additional insurance against the zero-bound constraint on interest rates. However, from
a normative point of view, we also show that welfare could be substantially improved by introducing
price-level targeting. The latter helps stabilize economic fluctuations and reduces the probability of
hitting the zero-lower bound. As a result, the optimal inflation rate under a price level targeting regime
would be close to zero. In other words, optimal monetary policy, characterized as a combination of a low
inflation target and a systematic response to deviations of the price-level from its target, can be
interpreted as being very close to the “price stability” enshrined in the legal mandates of most central
banks.

Note: The figures plot the approximation to the utility function in Proposition 1 from simulating the model for
different levels of steady-state inflation. Panel A includes results for the baseline model, the baseline model without
the ZLB, as well as the model with the ZLB but omitting the three cost channels of inflation: steady-state effects, the
changing coefficient on inflation variance in utility and the dynamic effects. Panel B reproduces our baseline with
ZLB, then presents results when we restrict the model to include only one cost of inflation and the ZLB. “Dynamic
cost only” includes only the dynamic effects of positive inflation and keeps the rest of the model being
approximated around zero trend inflation, “Steady-state cost only” includes only the steady-state cost of inflation
and keeps the rest of the model being approximated around zero trend inflation, while “Changing inflation weight
only” includes only the changing coefficients on inflation variance in the loss function and keeps the rest of the
model being approximated around zero trend inflation. See section 3.2 for details.

Note: The first row of the figure plots the coefficients of the approximation to the utility function from Proposition 1 for different levels of trend inflation. The
second row plots the variance of macroeconomic variables that enter the approximation to the utility function in Proposition 1 from simulating the model subject
to the zero bound on nominal interest rates for different levels of steady-state inflation using the baseline parameter values of the model. The dashed black lines
are the corresponding moments without the zero-bound on nominal interest rates, while the dotted lines correspond to the moments of the model when the
dynamics are approximated at zero trend inflation. The third row plots the contribution of the different components of the approximation to the utility function in
Proposition 1. See section 3.2 for details.

Each intermediate good producer has sticky prices, modeled as in Calvo (1983) where 1-λ is the
probability that each firm will be able to reoptimize its price each period. We allow for indexation of
prices to steady-state inflation by firms who do not reoptimize their prices each period, with ω
representing the degree of indexation (0 for no indexation to 1 for full indexation). Denoting the optimal
reset price of firm i by B(i), re-optimizing firms solve the following profit-maximization problem

Firm-specific marginal cost remain a function of aggregate variables and the reset price only because full

Note that this definition of labor input differs from the labor-only model. We make different assumptions

Log-linearization
In the model with capital the goods market clearing condition becomes

yˆt  cy cˆt  g y gˆt  iyiˆt

(B.22)

where c y , g y , and iy are the steady-state ratios of consumption, government and investment to output
respectively.

Lemma 6. Let c y , g y , and iy be the steady-state ratios of consumption, government and investment to
output respectively. Then

(B.24)

Proof: See Appendix C.

Corollary 1. Since c y , g y , and iy are independent of the degree of price stickiness  , they are equal to
their flexible price level counterparts, c y  c yF , g y  g yF , and iy  iy F .
Also, integrating over firm-specific production functions and log-linearizing yields the aggregate
production function:

Lemma 7. Let lower case letters denote the deviations from steady state values. Then the aggregate
production function up to a first order approximation is given by
yˆ t   kˆt  (1   )nˆt ,

(B.25)

Proof: See Appendix C.

Allowing for capital also changes the steady state effects of positive trend inflation. For example, the
steady-state level of the output gap (which is defined as the deviation of output from its flexible price
level counterpart) is given by

Lemma 9
We first note that,

vari (nˆt (i ))  vari (ln nt (i )  ln N tF )  vari (ln nt (i ))

To replace variability of log labor with variability of log prices we will use the market firms’ first order
conditions for inputs and combine it with the agents first order condition for labor supply,

(1   ) kt (i ) Wt (i ) PC

This implies that the idiosyncrasy in the capital-labor ratio is proportional to log labor input across firms,

This then allows us to calculate the cross sectional variation in output,

vari  ln yt (i )   vari  ln Yt   (ln pt (i )  ln Pt )    2 vari  ln pt (i ) 

(C.20)

and it follows that the cross-sectional variation in labor input is proportional to the cross-sectional

Appendix D: Taylor-pricing model with 3-quarter length contracts

In the Taylor-pricing model with 3-quarter length contracts, in each period one third of all firms can
change their price. This price will then have to last for 3 quarters before it can be reset. The model is
otherwise identical to the baseline model.
The firms maximization problem is now given by
