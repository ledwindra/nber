    "abstract": "\n\nThe general deterrence effects of malpractice laws on physician behavior have been extensively studied but may lack salience for physicians. We study the role of specific deterrence in malpractice liability by examining how physicians respond to being accused of malpractice. With the universe of data on patient care and malpractice complaints for Florida emergency physicians, we find that physicians oversee 9% fewer discharges after allegations and treat each discharge 5% more expensively. Effects are similar for paid claims and dropped accusations. Increases in treatment are generalized, i.e., not limited to conditions similar to what the physician is reported for.\n\n",
