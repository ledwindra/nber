    "abstract": "\n\nIn this paper, we estimate how hospital ownership of physicians\u2019 practices affects their patients\u2019 hospital choices.  We match data on the hospital admissions of Medicare beneficiaries, including the identity of their admitting physician, with data on the identity of the owner of the admitting physician\u2019s practice.  We find that a hospital's ownership of an admitting physician\u2019s practice dramatically increases the probability that the physician's patients will choose the owning hospital.  We also find that patients are more likely to choose a high-cost, low-quality hospital when their admitting physician\u2019s practice is owned by that hospital.\n\n",
