Abstract

A variety of qualitative dependent variable models are surveyed with
attention focused on the computational aspects of their analysis.
The models covered include single equation dichotomous models;
single equation polychotomous models with unordered, ordered, and

sequential variables; and simultaneous equation models. Care is
taken to illucidate the nature of the suggested "full information"
and "limited information" approaches to the simultaneous equation
models and the formulation of recursive and causal chain models.

1. Introduction
Very often economic variables observed are qualitative rather than
quantitative, e.g., whether or not a person buys a car, whether or not a person
buys a house, whether or not a person goes to a college, what mode of travel a

person chooses, what occupation a person chooses, etc. If these variables are
exogenous, there is no problem with the usual analysis. If these variables are
endogenous then we have a problem. We will first review some of these models

and then discuss the computational aspects. Earlier reviews can be found for
example in Amemiya [2), Cox [8], McFadden [17] and Nerlove and Press [18]. In
section 2 we outline the several functional forms that have been suggested for

binary choice or dichotomous models. In section 3 we outline the polychotomous
models and discuss the difference between the McFadden logit model and the usual
multinoinial logit model. In section 4 we discuss multivariate and simultaneous

equations models and some problems of identification. In section 5 we discuss
some estimation procedures and computational considerations that would be useful
in the preparation of a package for the TROLL system.

2. Different Functional Forms
Consider the case where there are only two possible choices, e.g., buy

a car or not, go to college or not, etc. The dependent variable y takes on the
values 1 or U corresponding to the two choices. The easiest method is to ignore
the nature of y and estimate the usual regression model

—2—

+

y =

u

(1)

But since y takes on the values 1 or 0, u can take on only two values (1-e'x)

and -'x. Hence we cannot assume homoscedasticity of the residuals (nor can we
assume normality). Goldberger [10] discusses a two step procedure to tackle

this problem of heteroscedasticity. Further discussion of the inadequacies of
this model can

be

found in Nerlove and Press [18].

To solve the different complications arising from the direct estimation
of (1), it has been suggested that a reasonable way of proceeding is to change
the specification (1) so that we say

P =

Prob

and

1-P

(y = 1) = Prob (u <

= Prob (y = 0) = 1

'x)

=

F('x)

(2)

- F('x)

and treat the observed values of y as a realization of a binomial process with
these probabilities.

There have been several suggestions in the literature for the distribution of u.

This is known as Urban's curve.

F('x) =

The range for 'x is restricted in this model.

is called Gompit P.

If u follows the Burr distribution [6] then

F('x)=1-

and we have Burnt analysis.
From the computational point of view there is possibly nothing to choose

from. Except the normal distribution, all the other functions have closed forms
for the cumulative distributions. However, this is not a major consideration in
the choice between the above mentioned models because computationally fast and

accurate approximations are available for the cumulative normal. What is of
relevance is whether the tails of the distribution of u are expected to be thicker

than those of the normal. If so then the other distributions have to be preferred. More importantly it is the symmetry aspect of the distribution of u that

might be disturbing. If so one can

use

other distributions of u like the gamma

or lognormal.

Though

there is a wide variety in the underlying distributions for a

binary choice or dichotomous model, this is not true for the polychotomous model
except

under special circumstances (when the variables are ordered or sequential).

Polychotoinous Models

Here, as outlined in Cox ([8], chapter 7) and Amemiya [2], we have to

distinguish between unordered, sequential and ordered variables. Examples of
unordered variables are: choice of mode of transport of occupation -

car,

bus, train, choice

lawyer, doctor, plumber, etc. Suppose there are k

One can consider the observations as arising from a multinomial distribution with

probabilities given by (6) and (7). Though, in principle, any of the previously
mentioned underlying distributions of u can be used, from the computational point

of view the logistic is the easiest to handle. In this case G(8x) in (5 is

There are also other reasons for preferring the logistic which

we will discuss later on. Since the logistic form will be the one that will be
used in further analysis of the multinomial model, we will write down equations

(6) and (7) explicitly. They are

An example of ordered response variable is the following.
group individuals by the amount

of

expenditures they make on a car.

Suppose we
We define

the variable y as follows:

y= 1

if the individual spends < $1,000

y= 2

if the individual

$1,000

but

< $2,000

y= 3

if the individual spends > $2,000

but

<

y=4

if the individual spends > $4,000

spends

>

$4,000

Finally, we have sequential models. An example of this is the following:

y=1

if the individual has not completed high school

y=

if the individual has completed high school but not college

2

y= 3

if the individual has completed college but not a higher
degree

y = 4

if the individual has a professional degree

Then the probabilities can be written as (see Ainemiya [2fl

As Ainemiya (2] points out, in such models the likelihood function can be maxi-

mized by maximizing the likelihood function of dichotomous models repeatedly.
For the case of ordered and sequential models any of the underlying

distributions mentioned in section 2 can be used. For the ordered response model,
there is only one underlying random variable u. For the sequential model with
k categories, there are (k-i) underlying variables but we assume these to be

independent. For instance, equations (10) are:

(11)

One question we have to ask is what is the underlying distribution for
the multinomial model given by (6) and (7)? Suppose there are k random variables
u1 u2 ..

and category j

is

chosen if

!x+u. < B!x+u.

i.e.,

P. =

Pr(u.—u1

<

9x-8x)

for all i :1:

j

for

j

all i

(12)

McFadden [16] shows that if u1 are independently and identically distributed with the distribution function
-e
F(u) = e

-u

then P. in (12) can be written as

e3
k
i=1

It

is often customary to write the multinomial logit model without any discussion

of the underlying probability distribution just by analogy to the binomial model

-8—

(Theil [21], Cox [7]). McFadden gave some justification to it in terms of a
stochastic choice theory.

McFadden's derivation of the multinomial logit is very general and
some of the economic applications that have been made are different from those

of what is referred to as the multinomial logit in the statistical literature.
He assumes (12) to be of the more general form.

Pr [u.—u < V.(x.)

P. =

Thus the function V.(x.) can

be of the form !x or 'x. or !x. and the

inter-

of the models is different.

As an illustration consider the two studies on occupational choice done

by Boskin [5] and

number

of

Schmidt

and

Strauss

[19]. In the study by Boskin there are a

of occupations and each is characterized

by three variables; present value

potential earnings, training cost/net worth, and present value of time unem-

ployed. Let x. denote the vector of the values of these characteristics for
occupation j. The probability that an individual chooses occupation j is

,x.

and (7)

where the P. have different coefficient vectors .

the vector

In the model (13)

gives the vector of implicit prices for the characteristics. Thus,

the problem analyzed here is similar to that analyzed in the hedonic price index

problem. Boskin obtains a different set of "implicit prices" for the character-

istics for white males, black males, white females and black females. These
coefficients tell us the relative valuation of the three characteristics mentioned

-9-

above by these different groups. Also, if we are given a new occupation not
considered in the estimation procedure and the characteristics of this new occupation, then we can
that

use the

estimated coefficients to predict the probability

a member chosen at random from each of the four groups would join this

occupation. Thus, the main use of

the model (13)

is to predict the probability

of choice for a category not considered in the estimation procedure but for
which we are given the vector of characteristics x3.
By contrast, the model on occupational choice considered by Schmidt
and Strauss [19] is the usual multinomial model given by equations (6) and (7).

Suppose there are k occupations and y is the vector of individual characteristics for individual i(age, sex, years of schooling, experience, etc.). Then
the probability that the th occupation is chosen by the individual with characteristics y. is

c'y.

with some normalization like

In (13) the number of parameters to be estimated is equal to the number of char-

acteristics of the occupations. In (14) the number of parameters to be estimated
is equal to the number of individual characteristics multiplied by (k-i) where k

is the number of occupations. The questions answered by the models are different.
In (14) we estimate the parameters and then given a new individual and his characteristics, we can predict the probabilities that he (or she) will choose one of
k occupations considered.
Of course one can combine both the models and write

In

McFadden [16], he considers an example of shopping mode choice where he takes

into account both the mode characteristics x. (transit walk time, transit wait
plus transfer time, auto vehicle time, etc.) and individual characteristics
(ratio of number of autos to number of workers in the household, race, occupation -

blue

collar or white collar).

In his discussion on choice of modes of transport Theil [22] specifies

the following model: Let

be bus, D2 train, D3 car, x1, x2, x3 the respective

travel times, and y income. Then he specifies the model as

which are of the same form as (15) except that the explanatory variables are in
the log form.

4. Multivariate Models
Suppose there are two jointly dependent variables each taking the values

o and 1. Then this can be reduced to a multinomial model with 4 categories and
the methods of the previous section hold good. If there are too many parameters
involved in this procedure then we can set some of the parameters equal to zero

and simplify the models. This will be discussed later on.
This method is applicable if the variables are unordered. Ainemiya [2]

gives the extension of the sequential model to the bivariate case. It consists
of specifying equations like (11) for each of the variables and assuming the cor-

responding residuals correlated with correlations p1 p2 p3 respectively. The

-11—

bivariate extension of the ordered response case follows along the same lines.
We specify equations like (8) or (9) for each of the variables and since there
is only one underlying random variable u (viz., u1 for the first variable and
u2 for the second variable) we have to estimate also a correlation coefficient

p. This model is computationally cumbersome to handle. Hence it may be better,
from the practical point of view, to ignore the ordering. Mantel ([15], p. 91)
and Nerlove and Press ([18], p. 22) suggest that the analysis be not constrained
by ordering.

Thus, from the practical point of view it is enough to consider the

unordered case. For illustrative purposes we will consider the case of three
dichotomous variables y1 y2 and
y.3.

Let ijk = Pr (Y1 =

i,

Y2 =

j,

Y3

=

k)

i,j,k = 0 or 1.

One question that we can ask is why not just treat this case as a multinomial

model with 8 catogories? We will here show what happens if we do that. Since,
as mentioned earlier, the multinomial model is most easily handled for the logistic

case, we will make that assumption. We can then write

P000 =

P100=e ID

coefficients of the equations (18). This symmetry was

discussed first by Nerlove and Press [18] and later by Amemiya [2] and

Schmidt and Strauss [20]. The model considered by them is a special case
of (18) with the following conditions:

(87-86—85—84+83+82+81)'x=y
We can get this model if the first element of x is 1, all but the first elements
of the vector 84 are equal to the sum of the corresponding elements of 82 and

with similar conditions holding for 8 and 86, and for 87 all but the first
element are equal to the sum of the corresponding elements of 8i, 82 and

83.

Thus, an important consequence of the multinomial logistic model (17)

is that we

get

the well defined conditional distributions (18). In actual prac-

tice, if there are a number of categories, the complete multinomial model (17)

involves too many parameters. That is why Nerlove and Press suggest estimating
equations (18) arguing that one can get consistent estimators for the parameters
(though these are not fully efficient because they ignore the cross equation con-

straints). This procedure reduces the number of parameters to be estimated -

considerably.

Further reduction can be achieved by making some simplifying as-

sumptions like (19). If we further impose the restriction 87868584+83+82+81 = 0
we can also eliminate the product terms involving y1 y2, y2 y3, y3 y1 in equations
(18)

Unlike the usual simultaneous equations model where it is not possible
to interpret each equation as a conditional expectation (except in a recursive
system) the specification (17) permits of well defined conditional probabilities

(18). Also, it looks as if we cannot have causal chains in

simultaneous equation logit models. This is indeed not so. Consider a situation
where the causal relations between y1 y2 y3 are as shown in figures 1 and 2.

-14-

Figure 2

Suppose that y1 and y2 are variables that do precede (in time or in

some other sense) variable y3. Then a relationship as in Figure 2 obviously
does not make sense and it is a relationship as in Figure 1 that we should be

considering. It might be thought that the symmetry conditions in equations
(18) imply that if y3 depends on

then the reverse must be true with the

same effect. This is of course not true. What the symmetry conditions imply
is that if y1 depends on y3 and y3 depends on y1 then the two effects should be

equal. We have to interpret the conditional probability equations (18) as depicting the nature of the causal relationships between the variables. For the
model in Figure 1 these causal relationships can be written in the following
form

Note that the symmetry conditions have been imposed only for the first two equations in (20) since y1 and y2 are jointly determined. One can estimate
from the joint probability distribution of y1 and y2. These joint probabilities

and equations (22) in conjunction with (21) will enable us to estimate the joint

probabilities ijk for any goodness of fit tests. If we assume the causal relationship in Figure 2, the conditional probabilities will be given by equations
(18), with any appropriate zero restrictions, and the joint probabilities will
be given by (17), again with the appropriate zero restrictions.

Given any specification of the conditional odds ratios as in (18) one

can deduce the joint probabilities (17). The ML estimation procedure based on
the implied joint probabilities (17) has been called the full information ML pro-

cedure by Nerlove and Press [18]. They argue that it is computationally less
cumbersome to estimate the conditional equations (18), that these estimates though
not fully efficient are consistent (see Ainemiya [2] for a heuristic proof) and that
in practice these should be adequate.
In the case of a recursive model, of course, as in the usual sirnul-

taneous equations context, the estimates from the conditional equations (18) would

-16-

be fully efficient. As an illustration consider the causal model

5. Methods of Estimation and

Computational

Considerations

Though a variety of models have been enumerated, and

all

these models

can, in principle, be analyzed with any of the functional forms mentioned in
section 2, the most commonly used functional form is the logistic and
commonly used models are

the

most

—17—

(a)

the McFadden logit model given by equation (13)

(b) the multinomial logit model given by equation (14)
(c) the general logit model given by equation (15)

and Cd) the simultaneous equations models of the Nerlove-Press type.
The ordered response models may be just treated as unordered multi-

nomial models following the suggestion of Mantel [is]. For instance Cragg and
Uhier [9] use the multinomial model to study the decisions:

(i) sell a car, replace a car, purchase additional car
and (ii) number of cars owned 1, 2, 3 or more.
Strictly speaking neither of these can be treated as a standard multinomial model but possibly introducing additional complications is not worthwhile.
Of the four models mentioned above, the likelihood function for (a)

seems to be better behaved than for (b). McFadden [161 reports that the NewtonRaphson method converged slowly and that Davidson's variable metric method gave

faster convergence. He says that the ML method proved practical up to 20 variables
and 2000 observations. It is obvious that for model (b) it is not possible to
handle 20 variables. The number of parameters to be estimated for model (b) increases

and

with the number of categories, unlike the case for model (a). Schmidt

Strauss

[19] use five occupational categories and have five variables (including

a constant term). Thus they estimate 5
the

x 4 = 20

parameters. This seems to be

number of parameters that can be conveniently handled in these models.
Jones [13] reports in connection with the estimation of model (b) that

initial estimates obtained from the linear discriminant functions were often far
from the ML solution and that simple Newton-Raphson procedures often diverged.

He uses the Fletcher-Powell method and Davidson's variable metric method. On the
other hand there have been others (like }iaggstrom at Rand) who

their

have argued that

experience is that the ML estimates are not much different from those given

by the discriminant function and hence it is not worthwhile bothering to use the

-18—

case, the initial values for method (b) are almost always
from the discriminant function. The same is not true for method (a).

ML method. In any
obtained

The multinomial model (b) has indeed

approach

been derived using the discriminant function

(e.g., see Cox [7], Jones [13]) and there is a close relationship be-

tween the two. The same is not the case with McFadden's model - model (a).
Walker and Duncan [23] suggest a weighted least squares method for

the multinomial logit model. The procedure is as follows:

Walker and Duncan weighted iterative non-linear least squares based on equations
(25) and (26). Ainemiya [3] shows that this method is equivalent to the method of

scoring. Thus, we need not consider this method as an alternative to the ML
method.

Broadly
of

speaking we need two sets of programs to handle the two types

data we encounter: grouped and

weighted

ungrouped

data. For the former we can use

least squares methods. For the latter the ML methods. If there

is only

one explanatory variable x, then even if we have detailed observations, we might
want to group the data and use the weighted least squares methods because they

are much simpler to use. This is what was done by Zellner and Lee [24] where

-19-

there was only one explanatory variable, income, and the spending units were
grouped

into 12 income classes.

For the binomial model, the weighted least squares method (also known
as minimum logit X2 method) is as follows:

Thus, the weighted least squares procedure would be to regress 1./a. f. (1 -

on the x's to get estimates of the s's.
Theil extends this method to the multinomjaj. model (see Theil [22J).

McFadden's program reduces the general logit model (15) with any extra
interaction terms, into a model of the type (13) with an appropriate definition

of dummy variables corresponding to the individual characteristics y1. In practice this would involve the creation of a very large number of variables many
of which will assume zero values for a large number of cases and it is doubtful
if this is the most appropriate way of handling the model on the Troll system.

Goodman has a program for the analysis of contingency tables. In
econometric work we anyhow need to incorporate a number of exogenous variables.

Thus the Goodman programs would not be of much use. The Nerlove-Press program
does allow for exogenous explanatory variables. However, the program imposes
the conditions (19) and also assumes all second and higher order interactions

to be zero (i.e., coefficients of y1y2, y2y3, etc., in (18) are zero). Also, as
discussed earlier one might not always want to consider a model in which all the

endogenous variables are determined jointly. One might sometimes want to formulate causal chain models. How much flexibility one should allow will depend on
what sort of problems one would be solving on the Troll system.
