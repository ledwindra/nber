ABSTRACT
We use yield spreads to construct ex-ante returns on corporate securities, and then use the ex-ante
returns in asset pricing assets. Differently from the standard approach, our tests do not use ex-post
average returns as a proxy for expected returns. We find that the market beta plays a much more
important role in the cross-section of expected returns than previously reported. The expected value
premium is significantly positive and countercyclical. We find no evidence of ex-ante positive
momentum profits.

Introduction

The standard asset pricing theory argues that investors should demand an ex-ante premium
for acquiring risky securities (e.g., Sharpe (1964), Lintner (1965), and Merton (1973)). In
practice, because the ex-ante risk premium is not readily observable, empirical asset pricing
studies often use ex-post, average realized equity returns as a proxy for expected equity
returns. This commonplace strategy is justified on grounds that for sufficiently long horizons
the average return will “catch up and match” the expected return on equity securities —
ex-post average excess equity returns provide for an easy-to-implement, seemingly unbiased
estimate of expected equity risk premium.
Despite its popularity, the above strategy has potentially serious limitations. 1 In particular, the average realized return might not converge to the expected risk premium in finite
samples.2 This, in effect, conditions any inferences based on ex-post returns on the properties of the particular data under examination. In his AFA presidential address, Elton (1999)
observes that there are periods longer than ten years during which stock market realized
returns are on average lower than the risk-free rate (1973 to 1984), and periods longer than
50 years in which risky bonds on average underperform the risk-free rate (1927 to 1981).
Based on this “counter-intuitive” evidence on risk and return, Elton proposes:
“[D]eveloping better measures of expected return and alternative ways of testing
asset pricing theories that do not require using realized returns have a much
higher payoff than any additional development of statistical tests that continue
to rely on realized returns as a proxy for expected returns.” (p. 1200)
As most findings in the empirical asset pricing literature were established (and are revisited)
with the use of realized returns, it is natural to ask whether extant inferences about risk–
expected return trade-off hold under an alternative, direct measure of expected return.
In this paper, we construct an ex-ante measure of risk premium based on data from
bond yield spreads and investigate whether well-known equity factors, such as market, size,
1

Earlier studies have discussed in some detail the noisy nature of average realized returns in a number of
different contexts (see, e.g., Blume and Friend (1973), Sharpe (1978), and Miller and Scholes (1982)).

Complexity in learning about asset pricing formation might also cause ex-post returns to deviate from
their expectations (see Lewellen and Shanken (2002) and Brav and Heaton (2002)).

book-to-market, and momentum, can explain the cross-sectional variation of expected (as
opposed to average realized) stock returns. Our basic approach builds on the observation
that debt and equity are financial claims written on the same set of real assets and hence
must share common risk factors. In particular, our analysis explores this insight to show
how one can use corporate bond data to glean information about investors’ required equity
risk premium. In what follows, we derive an analytical formula that links ex-ante equity risk
premia and bond risk premia after adjusting bond yields for default risk, rating transition
risk, and the tax spreads between the corporate and the Treasury bonds.
Why use bond data? While relevant information regarding a firm’s systematic risk is
incorporated both into its stocks and bonds, the latter reveal key insights about investors’
return expectations. The first thing to notice is that bond yields are calculated in the spirit
of forward-looking internal rates of return. To wit, bond yield is the expected return if the
bond does not default and the yield does not change in the subsequent period. Importantly,
current bond prices impound the probability of future default, and yield spreads contain the
expected risk premium for taking default risk. Controlling for default risk, firms with higher
systematic risk will have higher yield spreads; a relationship that holds period by period,
cross-sectionally. This contrasts sharply with what one can learn from equity securities,
whose prices reveal little conditional information about expected cash flows and discount
rates — one has to rely on a long time series to “back out” the expected return.3
Secondly, notice that the time-variation of expected returns in the equity markets often
works against the convergence of average realized returns to the expected return. Consider,
for example, that investors require a higher equity risk premium from cyclical firms during
economic downturns. To reflect this, those firms’ equity prices should fall and their discount
rates rise during recessions.

Cyclical firms’ equity values indeed fall during economic

downturns, reflecting value losses in those firms’ underlying assets. However, by averaging
ex-post a cyclical firm’s returns over the course of a recession, one might wrongfully conclude
that the cyclical firm is less risky because of its lower “expected” return. Bond yield spreads,
3

As pointed out by Sharpe (1978), the CAPM only holds conditionally and expected return might have
nothing to do with future realized returns. Risk premia recovered from bond yields, in contrast, will reflect
conditional information.

2

in contrast, increase during recessions: yield spreads move in the same direction of the
discount rate and they are higher for cyclical firms.
Our principal goal in this paper concerns the empirical applicability of a basic risk
argument linking yield spreads and expected equity returns. Building on Merton’s (1974)
framework, we first formalize our ideas. We then test our pricing predictions using standard
multi-factor models. In our view, the asset pricing tests of this paper provide fresh insights
in to the determinants of the cross-section of expected returns, complementing the inferences
based on average realized returns.
Our main findings can be summarized as follows. First, the market beta plays a more
important role in explaining the cross-sectional variation of expected returns than previously
documented. Its explanatory role remains significant even after we control for size, book-tomarket, and prior returns. This finding is striking given the well-publicized “weak” relation
between market beta and ex-post average returns (see, e.g., Fama and French (1992)). In
effect, our findings are more consistent with those of Kothari et al. (1995), who estimate
market betas from annual return data and find economically and statistically significant
compensation for beta risk. We conjecture that the market beta is more significant in our
tests because ex-ante returns are much less noisy than ex-post returns.
Second, the expected value premium is significantly positive throughout our sample period (from 1973 to 1998). Moreover the ex-ante value premium is countercyclical. As a whole,
our evidence supports the view that book-to-market captures relevant dimensions of risk that
are priced ex-ante in equity returns (e.g., Fama and French (1993, 1996)). In addition, it
lends support to studies highlighting the effects of business cycles and conditional information
on the value premium (e.g., Ferson and Harvey (1999) and Lettau and Ludvigson (2001)).
Third, we find that there are no ex-ante positive momentum profits. In fact, momentum
is priced ex-ante with a negative sign. This finding is consistent with several interpretations.
For example, one interpretation is that investors do not expect stocks with comparatively
high prior returns to be riskier and earn higher returns in the future. In other words,
momentum might not be an ex-anted priced risk factor, consistent with behavioral models
of Barberis et al. (1998), Daniel et al. (1998), and Hong and Stein (1999). Alternatively,
3

the ex-ante distribution of returns might deviate from the ex-post distribution of returns
because of incomplete information and learning. In other words, ex-post returns might
appear predictable to an econometrician, but investors can neither perceive nor exploit
this predictability ex-ante (see Brav and Heaton (2002), Lewellen and Shanken (2002),
and Shanken (2004)). Yet another interpretation for our findings is that momentum is an
empirical by-product of using average realized returns as a (poor) proxy for expected returns.
This interpretation, coupled with the fact that momentum strategies involve frequent trading
in securities with high transaction costs (see Lesmond et al. (2004)), raises the possibility
that momentum may be an “illusion” of profit-taking opportunity.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses related literature.
Section 3 describes the construction of our expected equity risk premium. Section 4 reports
our findings on the time series of common equity factors and on the cross-sectional variation
of equity risk premium. Finally, Section 5 summarizes and interprets our results.

Related Literature

The empirical asset pricing literature has traditionally used average realized equity returns
as surrogates for expected equity returns. Recently, several papers have experimented with
alternative proxies for expected returns. Our work is largely related to this line of research,
as well as to the literature on the relation between yield spreads and equity returns. We find
it important to establish these connections here.
Linking expected equity returns to yield spreads has a long tradition in empirical finance.
Harvey (1986, 1988) is among the first to link yield spreads to consumption growth, an important component of pricing kernels that affect expected returns. Chen et al. (1986) find that
yield spreads are priced in equity returns. Ferson and Harvey (1991) and Harvey (1991) use
the yield spreads as instruments for expected equity returns. Other examples include Keim
and Stambaugh (1986), Campbell (1987), Fama and French (1989, 1993), and Jagannathan
and Wang (1996). Importantly, all of those papers model expected market risk premium as a
function of aggregate yield spreads. The novelty of our study is that we model firm-level expected returns as a function of firm-level yield spreads. In other words, while previous papers
4

focus on the market equity premium, we focus on the cross-section of expected returns.
Recently, researchers have looked for alternative measures of expected returns. Brav et
al. (2003) use analyst forecasts to construct the ex-ante equity risk premium (below we draw
comparisons between our results and those of Brav et al.). Likewise, in an intriguing paper,
Graham and Harvey (2003) obtain direct measures of the equity risk premium from surveying
Chief Financial Officers of U.S. corporations. They find evidence of a variable one-year risk
premium, but a more stable ten-year risk premium. Our work is also in the spirit of a stream
of papers that use valuation models to estimate expected equity risk premium (examples are
Blanchard (1993), Gebhardt et al. (2001), and Fama and French (2002)).
Also close in spirit is Vassalou and Xing (2004), who build on Merton’s (1974) option
pricing model to compute default likelihood measures for individual firms. They find that
default risk has a significant impact on equity returns, and that the size effect and part of
the value effect are driven by default risk. Our paper is related to theirs because we also
use information from corporate debt to price corporate equity. However, differently from
Vassalou and Xing, who use average realized returns, we use direct measures of expected
returns. In a sense, our paper combines insights from both Vassalou and Xing and Brav et
al. (2003). Another important connection with the literature concerns Bekaert et al. (2004),
who present a model with stochastic risk aversion that is consistent with many stylized facts
in the aggregate stock and bond markets. As Bekaert et al., we also explore the simultaneity
between debt and equity pricing. Our focus, however, is on the cross-section of returns.
Above all, we differ from the existing literature because we use firm-level bond data to
construct expected equity returns. In essence, we explore the part of investors’ information
set that is uniquely tied to investors’ revealed preferences — their actual demand for risky
corporate securities (bonds). Also new is our approach to recovering information from bond
data. The details of this approach are provided in the next section.

Constructing Expected Equity Returns

This section describes the construction of expected equity returns based on bond data.
Section 3.1 lays out the basic idea. Section 3.2 formalizes our argument through a series of
5

propositions. Implementation details of our method are described in Section 3.3.

3.1

The Basic Idea

Our basic insight comes from the observation that bond and equity risk premia are
intrinsically connected because bond and equity securities are contingent claims written on
the same set of productive assets — an idea that can be traced back to Merton (1974). Using
this link, we recover the ex-ante equity risk premium from the bond risk premium. From
the definition of bond price as a function of bond yield, we back out the bond risk premium
from the observable yield spreads, which are forward-looking. We then conduct asset pricing
tests in which we replace realized equity returns with the constructed equity risk premium.
In our empirical tests, we follow Fama and French (1992, 1993) and study potential
common factors driving the cross-sectional variation in expected equity returns.

This

strategy is consistent with Merton’s (1974) original work, even though Merton uses a singlefactor dynamic model. To see this, note that the firm value is driven by a one-dimensional
Brownian motion in Merton. Naturally, bond and equity returns inherit a single-factor
dynamic structure. Crucially, though, one can also assume that firm value is driven by a
multi-dimensional Brownian motion within the very framework used by Merton. This is
exactly what we do — see Eqs. (A1) and (A2) in Appendix A. Because Merton’s contingent
claim analysis is agnostic about the nature of the process driving firm value, all of his bond
pricing results will go through in our multi-factor setting. Bond and equity returns hence
inherit a multi-factor structure in our extension of Merton’s economy.
Noteworthy, even if we use a single-factor dynamic model for bond and equity returns in
theory, we can still look for potential unconditional multi-factor specifications of bond and
equity returns in practice. The reason is that a conditional single-factor model can be observationally equivalent to an unconditional multi-factor model (e.g., Cochrane (2001, p. 146–
148)). To wit, scaling the time-varying loadings in the conditional single-factor model or scaling the single factor itself by instruments (such as, the default premium, the term premium,
or the dividend yield) will lead to a multi-factor unconditional model with fixed loadings.
The equivalence between single-factor conditional models and multi-factor unconditional
6

models is illustrated, for example, in the simulations of Gomes et al. (2003). Their model is
a single-factor conditional Consumption-CAPM. Yet, using simulated data generated from
the model, Gomes et al. find that size and book-to-market can explain the cross-section of
average returns in multi-factor unconditional specifications.

Proof. See Appendix A.
Proposition 1 is intuitive. Since both equity and debt are contingent claims written on
the same set of productive assets, a firm’s equity risk premium is naturally tied to its debt
risk premium. Eq. (1) formalizes the intuition. The equity risk premium equals the debt risk
premium multiplied by two coefficients. The first coefficient is the first derivative of equity
with respect to debt. The second coefficient is the debt-equity ratio.
Empirically, Eq. (1) allows us to recover the expected equity risk premium using expected
bond risk premium without assuming that the average realized equity return is an unbiased
measure of the expected equity return. The next two propositions introduce our method of
i
constructing expected bond risk premium, RBt
−rt , from observable bond characteristics.

Proposition 2 Let Yit be the yield to maturity, Hit be the modified duration, and Git be
the convexity of firm i’s bond at time t. In the absence of tax differential between corporate
bonds and Treasury bonds, the following relation holds for expected bond excess return and
observable bond characteristics:
i
RBt
− rt = (Yit − rt ) − Hit

Proof. See Appendix A.

Eq. (2) is easy to interpret. The first term on the right-hand side is the yield spread
between the corporate bond and Treasury bill, which equals the expected excess return of
the bond if the bond yield remains constant. The next two terms adjust for the changes in
bond yield: the first order change is multiplied by modified duration and the second order
change is multiplied by convexity. In essence, Eq. (2) provides a second order approximation
of the bond risk premium based on the yield spread.
The next challenge is to model adequately the yield change. The extant literature is rich in
models for bond yields (e.g., Merton (1974), Longstaff and Schwartz (1995), Collin-Dufresne
and Goldstein (2001), and Huang and Huang (2003)). Rather than imposing a parametric
model on the yield process, we focus on capturing two important empirical patterns: (i)
bond value decreases in the event of default, and (ii) bond ratings generally revert to their
long-run means conditional on no-default. Our objective is achieved in the next proposition.
Proposition 3 Let π it be the expected default probability, dYit− be the yield change
conditional on default, and dYit+ be the yield change conditional on no-default. Then expected
bond excess return is given by:
i
RBt
− rt = (Yit − rt ) + EDLit + ERNDit

where EDL denotes expected default loss rate, and is defined as:

Proof. See Appendix A.
Finally, notice that part of the yield spread of corporate bonds over Treasury bonds
arises because corporate bond investors have to pay state and local taxes while Treasury
bond investors do not. Hence, the component in the yield spread that is related to the tax
differential should be removed from the spread if one wants to obtain a clean measure of
8

the bond risk premium. Let Ci be the coupon payment for bond i and let τ be the effective
state and local tax rate, then:
i
RBt
− rt = (Yit − rt ) + EDLit + ERNDit − ETCit

where ETC denotes expected tax compensation, and is given by:


Ci 1

ETCit = (1 − π it )
Bit dt

(6)

(7)

In Eq. (7), (1 − π it ) BCiti dt1 is the coupon rate conditional on no-default. The expected default
loss rate, EDL, is also included in (7) to capture the tax refund in the event of a default.
Our propositions are consistent with the valuation method in Merton (1974). In fact,
because our formulations are in essence a second order Taylor expansion, the two approaches
are mathematically equivalent. Merton models equity as an European call option on the
underlying asset. The value of corporate debt, Bit , which has face value K and maturity T ,
is equal to Bit = Dt −Pit , where Dt is the price of a risk free bond and Pit is a put option. The
 
yield spread can then be calculated as yit = log BKit /T − r, a function of FKit and volatility
σ i only. It seems as if systematic risk has no effects on the yield spread.
Notice, however, that the firm value process follows

dFit
Fit

= µi dt + σ i dω t , where µi is the

instantaneous expected return of firm i, determined by its covariance with the stochastic
discount factor. Now, consider two firms, 1 and 2, with firm 1 having a higher systematic
risk and thus a higher expected return. Since firm 1’s value grows faster than that of firm
2, all else equal, firm 1 will have a lower default probability. Hence, even though both firms
have the same yield spread, after adjusting for the fair compensation for default risk, firm 1
has a higher component in the yield spread representing its higher systematic risk. In sum,
the yield spreads, after properly adjusting for default risk and other components, are capable
of identifying the cross-sectional variation of systematic risk and expected returns.

We obtain firm-level bond data from the Lehman Brothers fixed income data set, which
provides monthly information on corporate bonds, including price, yield, coupon, maturity,
modified duration, and convexity, from January 1973 to march 1998. This data set, widely
used in empirical research (e.g., Duffee (1999) and Elton et al. (2001)), covers a reasonably
long period of time. Duffee provides a detailed description of the data set. We only include
non-matrix prices because they represent true market quotes. As in Elton et al., we exclude
bonds with maturity less than one year since these bonds’ prices are less reliable. We include
both callable and non-callable bond prices in an effort to retain as many bonds as possible,
but our conclusions also hold when only non-callable bonds are used. Finally, we only include
bonds issued by non-financial firms.
We obtain Treasury yields for all maturities from the Federal Reserve Board. Following
Collin-Dufresne et al. (2001), we compute yield spreads as the corporate bond yields minus
the Treasury yields with matching maturities.
Expected Default Loss Rate, EDLit
The expected default loss rate equals the default probability times the actual default loss
rate. Moody’s publishes information on annual default rates sorted by bond rating from 1970
to 2001, and we use these data to construct expected default probabilities. We note that the
literature on default risk typically only uses the unconditional average default probability
for each rating and ignores the time variation in expected default probabilities (Elton et
al. (2001) and Huang and Huang (2003)). Differently from these papers, our approach is
designed to capture time variation in default probability. To do so, we use the three-year
moving average default probability from year t − 2 to t as the one-year expected default
probability for year t.4 For the case of Baa and lower grade bonds, if the expected default
4

The choice of a three-year window is based on the observation that there are many two-year but few
three-year windows without default. While we want to keep the number of years in the window as small
as possible, we also want to ensure that expected default probabilities are not literally zero. We have also

10

probability in a given year is zero, we replace it with the lowest positive expected default
probability in the sample for that rating. This ensures that even in occasions of no actual
default in three consecutive years, investors still anticipate positive default probabilities.
Table 1 reports the constructed expected default probabilities from 1973 to 1998 based on
Moody’s data. With only a few exceptions, expected default probabilities decrease with bond
ratings. Noteworthy, those default probabilities are typically higher during recessions than
during expansions, highlighting the systematic nature of corporate defaults. For example, in
the 1990–91 recession, the expected default probability of B3 bonds exceeds 25%, compared
to only 5–8% during the late 1990s expansion.
To construct the expected default loss rate, EDLit , we still need default loss rates.
Following Elton et al. (2001), we use the recovery rate estimates provided by Altman and
Kishore (1998). Their recovery rates for bonds rated by S&P are: 68.34% (for AAA bonds),
59.59% (AA), 60.63% (A), 49.42% (BBB), 39.05% (BB), 37.54% (B), and 38.02% (CCC).
As in Elton et al., we assume the equivalence between ratings by Moody’s and S&P (e.g.,
Aaa = AAA, . . ., Baa = BBB, . . ., Caa = CCC), and apply the same recovery rates.
We note that our calculations of expected default probability based on the three-year
moving average implicitly assume that the moving average converges to the true expected
default probability. Further, the recovery rates from Altman and Kishore (1998) are taken to
be unconditional. Admittedly, on these two particular aspects, our approach does not depart
significantly from the standard practice of replacing expected returns with average realized
returns. However, since yield spreads are considerably less volatile than stock returns —
especially at the firm level, the focus of our study — our method is, at a minimum, still less
subject to the criticisms discussed in Introduction.
experimented four other ways to capture the time varying one-year expected default probabilities: (i) using
the average one-year default probability from year t−3 to t−1; (ii) using the actual default probability itself
at year t; (iii) using the average default probability from year t to t+2; and (iv) using the average default
probability from year t+1 to t+4. Results from these alternative windows (available from the authors) have
no bearing on our main conclusions.

The Expected Return Due to Yield Changes Conditional on No-default, ERND it
To calculate ERNDit , we need to calculate dYit+ , the yield changes conditional on no-default.
We first some evidence on the mean-reverting behavior of default probabilities, and then
discuss our procedure of constructing dYit+ based on the bond data.
Evidence on Mean-Reverting Default Probabilities Empirically, if a bond does
not default, its default probability mean-reverts. In Table 2, we report one-year default
probabilities from one to 20 years conditional on no-default in the previous year. The cohorts
of bonds are sorted by their ratings in the initial year. These probabilities are constructed by

Table 2 : Annual Default Probability Conditional on No-Default in the Previous
Year (in Percent)
This table reports the annual default probability conditional on no-default in the previous year. The table
is constructed using the average one-year rating transition matrix of Moody’s and that of S&P Corporation,
reported in Table V of Elton et al. (2001).

using the one-year default transition matrices provided by Moody’s and S&P Corporation.
The first row of Table 2 shows that the default probability for Aaa bonds in the first year
is zero, a pattern consistent with that reported in the first three columns of Table 1. Table
2 reports positive default probabilities for Aaa bonds starting from the second year. This
is also consistent with the previous table because some Aaa bonds can be downgraded and
lower rated bonds have positive default probabilities.
More important, it is clear from Table 2 that, conditional on no-default, annual default
probabilities increase over the years for bonds with originally high rating, but they decrease
for bonds with originally low rating. For example, at year one, the one-year ahead default
probability for Caa bonds is 22.28%. The one-year default probability then goes down to
19.28% in the second year and to 16.43% in the third year. Since mean-reverting default
probabilities imply mean-reverting yields, high-quality bonds can have positive yield spreads

Table 3 : Evolution of Ratings and Yield Spreads in Corporate Bonds
This table uses Lehman Brothers Fixed Income data set (January 1973 to March 1998) to form cohorts of
bonds with the same initial rating each year. Ratings from Aaa to Caa are assigned integer numbers from
one to seven, with higher numbers indicating lower ratings. We report the average rating and yield spread
changes for the same initial rating groups. Changes in yield spreads are in percent. The t-statistics adjusted
for heteroscedasticity and autocorrelations of up to 12 monthly lags from GMM are reported in parentheses.

even though their one-year default rates are close to zero.
Table 3 provides further evidence on the mean reversion of yield spreads. On an annual
basis, we pool together all bonds belonging to the same Moody’s rating category in the
Lehman Brothers data set and study the changes in cumulative average ratings and yield
spreads over the following three years. We assign numeric numbers, from one to seven, to
bonds rated from Aaa to Caa, with a lower number corresponding to a better rating.
Table 3 shows that the ratings of high-quality bonds (Aaa, Aa) indeed decline over time
while their yield spreads increase. For example, the rating of Aa-rated bonds, conditional on
no-default, increases by 0.087 after a year, where an increase of one indicates a full downgrade
to grade A. Accordingly, the average yield spread of Aa bonds increases by 6.2 basis points.
In contrast, the ratings of low-quality bonds (Caa) improve over time and their yield spreads
decline. The evidence clearly shows mean reversion in yield spread conditional on no-default.
Modeling Mean-Reverting Yield Changes We adopt the following three-step
procedure to recover dYit+ , the yield change conditional on no-default, from the data. First,
14

we construct the cumulative default probability for each maturity using Table 2. For example,
the conditional default probabilities for a bond initially rated Baa are 0.16% and 0.31% for the
first two years, respectively. Assuming that the default rate is the same within a given year,
the cumulative default probabilities are 0.16%, 0.16%, 0.47% (= 0.16%+(1−0.16%)×0.31%),
and again 0.47% for 0.5-year, 1-year, 1.5-year, and 2-year maturity, respectively.
Second, for each bond we calculate the expected cash flow, while taking into account
possible default. The expected cash flow for a particular coupon date before maturity is
equal to: coupon payment × [1 − cumulative default probability × (1 − recovery rate)], where
the recovery rates are from Altman and Kishore (1998). We calculate the present value of
the bond by discounting its expected cash flows by the corresponding Treasury yields with
matching maturities.5 After we obtain bond prices, we then calculate bond yields.
For example, suppose the bond in the previous example has two years to maturity and
the coupon rate is 8% with face value of $100. Further assume that the current Treasury
yield, with annualized semi-annual compounding, is 8% for a two-year maturity. Without
default, the cash flows for the bond are $4, $4, $4, and $104 for the four half-year periods.
The recovery rate from Altman and Kishore (1998) for the Baa-rated bond is 49.42%. With
default risk, the expected cash flows are (1−0.16%×(1−49.42%))×4, (1−0.16%×(1−49.42%))×4,
(1 − 0.47% × (1−49.42%))×4, and (1−0.47%×(1−49.42%))×104, respectively. The present
value, when we use the discount rate of 8%, is thus $99.77. With the promised cash flows of
$4, $4, $4, and $104, and the price at $99.77, the bond yield equals 8.12%.
Third, assume that the bond does not default within the first year. Conditional on that
event, the bond maturity decreases by one year, and the second-year conditional default
probability reported in Table 2 becomes the first-year default probability for this “new”
bond. One can iterate over the last two steps to calculate the price and yield for the
new bond. Because conditional default probabilities of high grade bonds will increase in the
second year, bond prices will decrease and yields will increase, revealing a downgrading trend.
Similarly, because conditional default probabilities will decrease for low grade bonds in the
second year, bond prices will increase and yields will decrease, representing an upgrading
5

This is equivalent to calculating the fair price of the bond by a risk-neutral investor.

trend. The yield difference between the last two steps will be our proxy for the yield change
conditional on no-default within the first year. As expected, this yield change, dY it+ , will be
positive for high grade bonds but negative for low grade bonds.
Let’s again consider our numerical example. After one year, conditional on no-default, the
new cumulative default rates will be 0.31% and 0.31% for the 0.5-year and 1-year maturities.
Using our method to calculate the expected cash flows for this bond, we find the new price
to be $99.85 and the yield to be 8.17%. Thus, the bond yield will go up by five basis points
due to the expected increase of default probability. The five basis points will be used as dY it+
in calculating ERNDit , the expected return due to yield change conditional on no-default.
To sum up, ERNDit is a function of rating-specific default probability, bond specific
maturity, duration, convexity, and the Treasury yield for a given month. Although a bit
tedious, our method ensures that this component of yield spread dynamics is captured with
the best available information for the particular bond at any given time.
Expected Tax Compensation, ETCit
To calculate the expected tax compensation given by (7), we follow Elton et al. (2001)
and set the effective state and local tax rate to be 4% for all bonds. This completes our
construction of the four components in the bond risk premium formula (6).
Constructing Expected Equity Returns
Armed with a measure of expected bond risk premium, it is straightforward to use
Proposition 1 to obtain expected equity risk premium. Note, though, that we do not directly
observe

∂Sit
.
∂Bit

This derivative needs to be estimated from the data and the following steps

describe our estimation procedure.
First, we combine the bond data with CRSP monthly data to obtain market capitalization
for equity, and then merge it further with Compustat to gather information on firm leverage.
The final merged Lehman Brothers/CRSP/Compustat data set includes 1,023 non-financial
firms covering the period from January 1973 to March 1998.
Second, for each firm, we calculate the change of Sit as the market capitalization change
16

for each month. We also add together the value change for each bond within each firm. Our
bond data covers approximately 50% of all debt for each Compustat-matched firm, and in
order to obtain the change of Bit , we multiply the total bond value change by the ratio of
book debt from Compustat to the total bond face value from our Lehman Brothers data set.
We then obtain projected estimates for

∂Sit
∂Bit

using a pooled panel regression of

∂Sit
∂Bit

on a

constant and the debt/equity ratio (t-statistics in parentheses):
∂Sit
Bit
= 12.83 − 0.58
.
∂Bit (49.50) (12.55) Sit

(8)

While the specification of Eq. (8) is admittedly simple, we later conduct extensive robustness
checks using alternative specifications for

∂Sit
∂Bit

in Section 4.4. As it turns out, the above

parsimonious specification is already sufficient in delivering our main results.
The predicted negative relation between

∂Sit
∂Bit

and

Bit
Sit

agrees with theoretical priors. To

see this, consider the simple model of Merton (1974), in which the equity S is a European
call option on the underlying asset F . The debt is a zero coupon bond with face value of K

∂S
= 1−N

and maturity of T years. The Black and Scholes’ (1973) formula implies that:
where N (·) is the cumulative density function of normal distribution, d 1 ≡

and σ is the volatility of the firm’s asset return. Because d1 is always positive, N (d1 ) > 0.5
and

N (d1 )
1−N (d1 )

> 1. Moreover, because d1 decreases with

K
, N (d1 )
F 1−N (d1 )

decreases with the leverage

ratio. That is, for firms with higher leverage, a unit change of debt value is associated with
a smaller change in the equity value. Intuitively, given one unit of firm value change, the
change in equity value will be smaller if the debt portion is larger.
Having developed empirical counterparts for each of the components of our ex-ante return
measure, we substitute those estimates into Eq. (1) for each firm-month in our sample. We
can now study the pricing of risky securities with a direct measure of expected returns.

used in our expected equity return measure in Section 4.1. Section 4.2 studies the properties

of the common equity factors of Fama and French (1993) and momentum under our exante measure. Section 4.3 examines the cross-sectional variation of the expected equity risk
premium. Finally, Section 4.4 tests the robustness of our basic results.

4.1

Yield Spreads and Expected Bond Risk Premium

Table 4 reports summary statistics of yield spreads and constructed bond risk premia for Bthrough Aaa-rated bonds. Because data are not available on time-varying default rates for
bonds rated Caa or lower, we delete these bonds from the sample. (These bonds consist of
about one percent of all bonds.) We construct firm-level bond risk premium as the simple
average of the risk premia of all the bonds issued by the firm, but emphasize that the use
of value-weighted averages yields very similar results, as different bonds issued by the same
firm earn very similar risk premia.
Table 4 shows that the yield spread and the expected bond risk premium increase as the
bond rating decreases. The bond risk premium for Aaa-rated bonds is on average 0.46%
18

per annum, and it goes up to 2.24% for B-rated bonds. This evidence suggests that lower
graded bonds are systematically riskier than higher graded bonds. Both the yield spread
and the expected bond risk premium are highly persistent. The first-order autocorrelations
range from 0.82 to 0.97, and the 12th -order autocorrelations range from 0.10 to 0.60.

4.2

Common Factors in Expected Equity Returns

We define the market equity risk premium as the value-weighted average equity risk premia
of all firms. The expected returns of the size and book-to-market factors (SMB and HML,
respectively) are constructed following exactly the procedure used by Fama and French
(1993).

To construct the momentum factor, we sort stocks each month on the basis

of their realized equity return in the past 12 months into winners (W>70%), medium
(70%≥M≥30%), and losers (L<30%) categories.

We skip one month to avoid market

microstructure difficulties and hold the portfolios for 12 months. The momentum factor
is then computed as the winner-minus-loser (WML) portfolio.
Descriptive Statistics
Panel A of Table 5 reports the summary statistics of expected returns of the four common
equity factors. The expected market risk premium is on average 3.93% per annum. The
expected size premium is on average 5.68% and the expected value premium is on average
9.04%. The momentum factor, in contrast, earns a negative expected return of -2.02%.
Panel B of Table 5 reports the correlation matrix of the expected returns of the four
equity factors. The expected return of the market factor is positively correlated with the
size factor (0.19) and the book-to-market factor (0.68), but is negatively correlated with the
momentum factor (-0.44). We also find that the bond market portfolio earns on average
0.42% per annum (raw standard deviation of 0.33%). The equity market risk premium is
highly positively correlated with the market bond risk premium; with a correlation coefficient
of 0.86. This is not surprising under our approach since, as contingent claims on the same
productive assets, equity and bond should share similar risk factors.
Panel C reports the market regressions of SMB, HML, and WML. The unconditional
alphas of SMB and HML are 4.41% and 3.50% per annum, and are highly significant (t19

Business Cycle Properties
We now investigate the cyclical properties of the expected returns for the four equity factors
during the 1973–1998 period. Following the empirical business cycle literature (e.g., Stock
and Watson (1999, Table 2)), Table 6 reports the cross correlations (with different leads and
lags) of the expected returns with the cyclical component of the real industrial production
index.

The industrial production index is obtained from the monthly database of the

Federal Reserve Bank of Saint Louis. We follow Stock and Watson (1999) by removing
from the output series its long-run growth component as well as those fluctuations that
occur over periods shorter than a business cycle, which arise from temporary factors such

the Hodrick and Prescott (1997) filter. p-values of the cross correlations are reported in parentheses.

as measurement errors. This is achieved by passing the raw industrial production index
through the Hodrick and Prescott (1997) filter. Following Hodrick and Zhang (2001), we set
the monthly smooth parameter in the Hodrick-Prescott filter to be 6,400.
Table 6 reports a number of interesting patterns. First, the expected market risk premium
is negatively correlated with the cyclical component of output. The cross correlations are
mostly negative and significant across different leads and lags. This evidence suggests that
the expected market risk premium is countercyclical; i.e., investors demand a higher risk
premium in recessions. This finding speaks to the criticism voiced by Elton (1999) that
ex-post equity returns go down in recessions and thus fail to capture investors’ (presumably)
heightened required returns from risky assets in uncertain environments.
Second, both the expected size premium and the expected value premium are negatively
correlated with the cyclical component of output. In other words, investors seem to perceive
small and value stocks as riskier securities than big and growth stocks ex-ante, charging a
countercyclical risk premium for holding those assets. The final noticeable feature of Table 6
concerns the cyclical properties of momentum. In contrast to other equity factors, expected
momentum is strongly procyclical; the cross correlations between expected momentum
returns and output are positive and significant at most leads and lags.
21

Average Realized Excess Returns versus Expected Risk Premia
Since we argue that our constructed expected equity returns might provide new insights into
the pricing of equities, it is important to show how different our proxy is from the average
realized return. To this end, we run predictive regressions of future, realized cumulative
equity factor returns onto the expected factor returns constructed from yield spreads.
Table 7 reports the results. Four different horizons are considered: six-month, 12-month,
24-month, and 36-month. We test the convergence of average realized equity returns and
the constructed expected returns as follows. The null hypothesis is that the slope equals 1/2
in the six-month horizon, one in the 12-month horizon, two in the 24-month horizon, and
three in the 36-month horizon. We report the p-values associated with these tests.
From Panel A of Table 7, our proxy of the expected market risk premium is very close
to the average market excess return in short horizons up to 12 months. From the reported
p-values, the slope coefficient of regressing future realized returns onto the expected return is
not reliably different from 1/2 in the six-month horizon, and is not reliably different from one
in the 12-month horizon. However, the expected-return measure diverges from the average
realized returns over the longer horizons. Crucially, the null hypotheses of convergence at the
two- and three-year horizons are rejected at the five percent significance level. We believe
this evidence highlights the importance of time variation in return expectations and the
limitations involved in the use of ex-post return averaging. In essence, since the expected
market excess return varies over the long horizons, estimates of past expected returns cannot
serve as the convergence targets of the average realized returns.
Panel B of Table 7 reports a more drastic divergence between the expected returns and
the average realized returns of SMB. The slope coefficients of regressing the realized returns
on the expected returns are negative across all horizons. The null of convergence is rejected
in all cases. This suggests an explanation for why we find a significantly positive expected
size premium in the 1973–1998 period while studies using realized returns typically report
a weak or even negative size premium over comparable time periods. For example, Schwert
(2003) reports that the alpha of Dimensional Fund Advisors Small Company Portfolio is
0.20% per month with a standard error of 0.30% per month. Based on this evidence that the

for the 24-month horizon, and three for the 36-month horizon. We report the p-values in the parentheses for
these tests. And all the p-values are computed using standard errors estimated from GMM and adjusted for

size premium has weakened or disappeared after its discovery by Banz (1981), Schwert argues
that the size anomaly is “more apparent than real.” Our evidence, however, suggests that
the disappearance of the size effect could result from the high volatility of realized returns.
In particular, our estimate of the SMB alpha, 4.41% per annum or 0.37% per month, is well
within the one-standard-error bound estimated by Schwert.

4.3

The Cross-Section of Expected Equity Returns

We now examine the cross-sectional variation of expected equity returns. Using the Fama
and MacBeth (1973) methodology, we study whether the factor loadings on the market
beta, size, book-to-market, and momentum have explanatory power in the cross-section of
expected returns. Both covariances and characteristics are used in our asset pricing tests.

23

Covariance-Based Tests
Our covariance-based tests are conducted in two steps. In the first step, for each individual
stock and month, we run the time series regression of the equity returns in the past 60
months (with at least 24 months of data available):
i
= αit + β iMKT,t MKTt+1 + β iSMB,t SMBt+1 + β iHML,t HMLt+1 + β iWML,t WMLt+1 + εit+1 . (9)
rt+1
i
is the realized excess equity return of stock i from time t to t+1 over the onewhere rt+1

month Treasury bill rate, and MKT, SMB, HML, and WML are the excess return factors of
market, size, book-to-market, and momentum taken from Kenneth French’s website.
Following standard practice, we estimate the factor loadings in Eq. (9) using the realized
i
returns of rt+1
and the four factors. For comparison, we also estimate the loadings using

our constructed expected equity returns and the expected factor premia, all dated at time
eMKT,t , β
eSMB,t , β
eHML,t , and β
eWML,t .
t. The resultant loadings are denoted β

In the second step, we run cross-sectional regressions, month by month, of firm-specific,

expected equity returns on the factor loadings estimated from Eq.(9). The time series average
of the coefficients are regarded as the risk premia associated with the loadings. We use GMM
to adjust the standard errors of the coefficients for heteroscedasticity and autocorrelations of
up to 12 lags. The standard errors of the intercepts are then used to compute the t-statistics.
The null hypothesis in our cross-sectional tests is the CAPM. We also use size, bookto-market, and prior returns to test for model misspecifications. In doing so, we implicitly
assume that our constructed risk premia are unbiased measures of the true risk premia. In
other words, the measurement errors in the risk premia have a mean of zero — if there were
no measurement errors, then under the null hypothesis the regression R 2 should be one.
Panel A of Table 8 reports the cross-sectional regressions with the factor loadings. The
column denoted Model 1 shows that when the market beta estimated with the realized returns
is used alone, the slope coefficient is a positive 2.16% per annum and is highly significant.
Using the market beta estimated with the expected returns reduces the slope to 0.96%, but
it remains significant (Model 4). Thus, stocks with higher market betas will have higher
24

expected excess return, consistent with standard asset pricing models.
From Model 2 in Panel A, when the loadings on SMB and HML are also included, all three
Fama-French factors have positive and significant slopes. In particular, the market beta is
priced even in the presence of SMB and HML loadings, but the risk premium associated with
the market beta shrinks to 0.89% per annum. From Model 3, the risk premia of the SMB and
HML loadings remain positive and significant when the momentum factor is controlled for.
But the risk premium of the market beta is insignificant, albeit still positive. From Models 5
and 6, using the loadings estimated with the expected returns yields stronger pricing results
for the market beta. Its slope is 2.41% in the three-factor regression, and is 2.58% in the
four-factor regression. Both are significant.
Panel A also shows that the HML loading is reliably priced. This result is robust to
different model specifications and to different estimation methods of the factor loadings.
Finally, the cross-sectional R2 ’s range from 1.3% to 38.8%. We note that although these
R2 ’s are lower than those reported by Fama and French (1993, 1996) on the portfolio-level
data, they are generally higher than those from similar cross-sectional regressions on the
firm-level data.6 The reason is that our constructed expected returns are less volatile than
both the realized equity returns and the realized growth rates.
Characteristic-Based Tests
In Panel B of Table 8, we retain the loading on the market factor, but replace the other
loadings with firm characteristics. That is, we use the logarithm of size, the book-to-market
ratio, and the prior equity return to replace their respective factor loadings. From Model
7, the market beta estimated with the realized returns is again significantly priced but the
magnitude of its premium is only 1.12% per annum. Size has a negative and highly significant
premium, -4.18%, and book-to-market has a positive and highly significant premium, 4.78%.
Using the market beta estimated with the expected returns reduces its premium to 0.53%,
which is only marginally significant. However, the pricing results on size and book-to-market
6
For example, Chan et al. (2003, Table X) regress the growth rates of operating performance on an
exhaustive list of explanatory variables. Their highest R 2 is 11.75%, and most R2 s are below 5%.

linear function of the leverage ratio,

a natural starting point. For robustness, we conduct tests that use alternative specifications

We use equity volatility instead of firm volatility (as the leverage ratio is already included).

by

augmenting Eq. (10) with the log of market value, log(MEit ), the book-to-market ratio,

We have also experimented with the inclusion of the yield spread in the right-hand side
of Eq. (11). The reason is that

∂Sit

is an endogenous variable, potentially depending on

financing conditions captured by the yield spread. But the estimated slope of the yield
spread turned out small and insignificant. Accordingly, the pricing results are fairly similar
to those returned from Eq. (11) (available from the authors).7

We thank our referee for suggesting various robustness checks.

27

Table 9 reports the properties of the common equity factors that are constructed under
the alternative proxies for

∂Sit
∂Bit

from Eqs. (10) and (11); see Panels A and B, respectively.

The results are largely consistent with those of Table 5. We continue to find significantly
positive premia for the market and value factors. The size premium is significantly positive
with specification (10), but is insignificant with (11), albeit still positive.
Table 10 reports the cross correlations of the expected equity factors with the cyclical
component of the real industrial production index. Panels A and B report the results
with

∂Sit
∂Bit

given by Eqs. (10) and (11), respectively. From Panel A, the results are largely

unchanged from Table 6 as the expected market, size, and value premia are all countercyclical
and the expected momentum return is procyclical. And from Panel B, when

∂Sit
∂Bit

is modelled

as Eq. (11), the expected market and value premia continue to exhibit strong countercyclical
movements. However, the expected size and momentum returns are both acyclical. One
possible interpretation is that the additional regressors in Eq. (11) may have introduced
extra noise into Eq. (10).8
Table 11 reports the cross-sectional regressions of expected equity returns on factor
loadings and firm characteristics using the two alternative specifications of

∂Sit
.
∂Bit

The results

are very similar to those in Table 8. Notice that the pricing results of the market beta are
slightly stronger than those reported in Table 8. In particular, the slopes of the market betas
are positive and significant across all specifications. Further, the risk premia of the HML
loadings and the slopes of book-to-market are all significant and positive.

5

Summary and Interpretation

We construct measures of expected returns using bond yield spreads. The basic idea is
simple: because both equity and bond are contingent claims written on the same productive
assets (e.g., Merton (1974)), they must share the same systematic risk factors. We then use
the ex-ante returns to study the cross-section of expected equity returns. Differently from
the standard approach, our asset pricing tests do not assume that average realized returns

Those additional regressors are not directly related to the partial derivative of the equity value with
respect to the bond value, as predicted by Merton (1974).

Table 10 : Cross Correlations with Cyclical Component of Industrial Production:
Robustness Checks
This table reports the cross correlations of expected returns of equity factors with the cyclical component of
the industrial production index, corr(rt , yt+k ), for different leads and lags, k. The cyclical component of the
real industrial production index (obtained from FRED) is estimated by passing the raw series through the
Hodrick and Prescott (1997) filter. Expected returns are constructed using two alternative specifications of
∂Sit
∂Bit . p-values of the cross-correlations are reported in parentheses.

are an unbiased proxy for expected returns. Our new approach yields several fresh insights
regarding the determinants of the cross-section of returns.
First and foremost, we document that the market beta plays a much more important
role in the cross-section of expected returns than previously reported. The market beta is
significantly priced in most of our cross-sectional regressions even after we control for popular
characteristics such as size, book-to-market, and prior returns.
Our beta-pricing result contrasts with Fama and French (1992), who show that the market
beta does not have any explanatory power with and without the size and book-to-market
factors. Instead, our finding lends support to Kothari et al. (1995). Kothari et al. estimate

30

market betas from regressing annual portfolio returns onto the annual equally weighted
market returns, finding economically and statistically significant compensation (about 6–9%
per annum) for beta risk. Our result is also consistent with Brav et al. (2003). Those
authors use analyst forecasts to construct expected returns and also find a positive and
robust relation between expected returns and market beta.
Second, we find that the ex-ante market, SMB, and HML returns are significantly positive
and generally countercyclical. This evidence lends support to Fama and French (1993, 1995,
1996), who argue that size and book-to-market factors are ex-ante priced risk factors. In
this regard, our result differs from Brav et al. (2003), who find that high book-to-market
firms are not expected to earn higher returns than low book-to-market firms (a finding that
is inconsistent with the notion that book-to-market is a risk factor).
Our evidence on the countercyclicality of the expected value premium lends support to
studies emphasizing the effect of conditional information on the value premium. Ferson and
Harvey (1999) show that loadings on aggregate predictive variables provide significant crosssectional explanatory power for stock returns even after controlling for the Fama-French factors. Lettau and Ludvigson (2001) show that value stocks are more correlated with consumption growth than growth stocks in bad times when risk or risk premium is high. 9 A theoretical
explanation of the countercyclical expected value premium is provided by Zhang (2005). He
argues that it is more costly for firms to reduce than to expand capital. In bad times, firms
want to scale down, especially value firms that are less productive than growth firms. Because
scaling down is difficult, value firms are more adversely affected by economic downturns.
Finally, we find that there are no ex-ante positive momentum profits. More exactly,
momentum is priced ex-ante, but with a negative sign. Brav et al. (2003) report a similar
finding using alternative ex-ante return measures. This evidence is consistent with several
interpretations. For example, investors may expect stocks with high prior returns to be
less risky and to have lower returns in the future than stocks with low prior returns. Then
9

Subsequent studies that use different econometric techniques but reach similar conclusion include Ang
and Chen (2004), Jostova and Philipov (2004), Petkova and Zhang (2004), and Anderson et al. (2005). But
Lewellen and Nagel (2004) highlight that the covariance between the value beta and the expected market
risk premium is too small to explain the value anomaly within the conditional CAPM.

31

positive momentum profits in ex-post returns come as a surprise to investors, and hence do
not show up in ex-ante returns. This interpretation suggests that momentum profits result
from systematic mispricing due to, e.g., conservatism (Barberis et al. (1998)), self-attributive
overconfidence (Daniel et al. (1998)), and slow information diffusion (Hong and Stein (1999)).
Alternatively, the ex-ante distribution of stock returns perceived by investors may deviate
from the ex-post distribution of stock returns (e.g., Brav and Heaton (2002) and Lewellen
and Shanken (2002)). According to this argument, investors must learn about economic fundamentals because of incomplete information. As a result, the ex-ante return distribution
perceived by investors often deviates from the ex-post return distribution. Shanken (2004)
highlights that this deviation can affect the interpretation of asset pricing tests. In particular,
ex-post returns can appear predictable to econometricians, but investors might neither perceive nor exploit this predictability ex-ante. This interpretation does not rely on mispricing.
Finally, momentum profits are likely an empirical by-product of using average realized
returns as expected returns.

In other words, momentum might arise from the use of

average realized returns as a poor proxy for expected returns.

Our evidence, coupled

with the fact that implementing momentum strategies requires frequent trading in securities
with disproportionately high transaction costs (e.g., Lesmond et al. (2004)), suggests that
momentum may be an illusion of profit opportunity when, in fact, none exists.
While we do not claim that our ex-ante return measures should dominate any other
measures, we believe that reexamining basic inferences in empirical finance with alternative
proxies for investor expectations is a valid, relevant experiment. Because our proposed measure captures information that — both on theoretical and empirical grounds — is imperfectly
correlated with ex-post average returns, we believe that experiments like ours can provide
for fresh insights in to the economic determinants of the cross-section of expected returns.

Table 11 : The Cross-Section of Expected Equity Risk Premium: Robustness Checks
This table reports the Fama-MacBeth cross-sectional regressions of expected excess returns on the factor loadings as well as firm characteristics such
as size, book-to-market, and past returns. We estimate factor loadings using 60-month (or at least 24-month) rolling regressions of equity excess
returns onto the Fama-French three factors and the WML excess returns. In the rolling regressions, we use both realized returns (with betas denoted
e

e
β MKT , β SMB , β HML , and β WML ) and constructed expected returns (with betas denoted β
MKT , β SMB , β HML , and β WML ). The t-statistics reported in
parentheses are adjusted for autocorrelations of up to 12 lags, and are estimated with GMM. All the regression coefficients are in annualized percent.

Proofs

Proof of Proposition 1: Let the uncertainty be represented by a N -dimensional Brownian
motion Wt = (w1t , w2t , . . . , wN t )0 . There are M firms, F1 , F2 , . . . , FM whose asset values obey
the following well-defined stochastic processes:
dFit
= µit dt + σ 0it dWt
Fit

(A1)

0

where i = 1, . . . , M and σ it ≡ (σ i1t , σ i2t , . . . , σ iN t ) . Following Merton (1974), we assume that
all firms are levered with predetermined debt. For firm i, both the equity price S it and debt
value Bit will depend on the underlying asset value Fit .
Assume that the state price density process, Λt , is given by:
dΛt = µΛt dt + σ 0Λt dWt .

(A2)

It follows that firm i’s expected excess return on its asset is given by:

Λt
instantaneous conditional covariance (normalized by dt), and rt ≡ −µΛt /Λt is the real interest
rate.
As equity Sit and debt Bit are contingent claims written on the same underlying
productive asset, an application of Itô’s lemma yields the risk premia for these two securities:

of (A4) and (A5).

Proof of Proposition 2: Similar to Jarrow (1978), we start with the bond yield equation:
Bit =

n
X

Ci e−Yit Tj + Ki e−Yit Tn ,

(A6)

j=1

where Ci is the coupon payment of the bond, n is the number of remaining coupons, Yit
is the bond’s yield to maturity, Tj , j = 1, . . . , n are length of time period for each coupon
38

payment, and Ki is the face value of debt.
As the bond yield, Yit , is the only time-varying variable on the right-hand side of (A6),
by Itô’s Lemma we can write bond risk premium as a function of the bond yield and other
observable bond characteristics:

and Hit and Git are modified duration and convexity, respectively. (A7) thus becomes:

Proof of Proposition 3: The proposition follows by combining (2) with:

(dYit )2 = π it (dYit− )2 + (1 − π it )(dYit+ )2
