JEL No. J13, I38
ABSTRACT
This paper examines the impact of actual subsidy receipt of single mothers on their joint
employment and child care mode decisions in the post-welfare reform environment, which places
a high priority on parental choice with the quality and type of care chosen. Results indicate that
single mothers are highly responsive to child care subsidies by increasing their employment while
moving from parental and relative care to center care in the process.

I. Introduction and Background
The United States has witnessed a rapid growth in public subsidies for child care
in the 1990s. This trend has become even more pronounced since the passage of welfare
reform in 1996, which aimed at reducing welfare dependence and increasing
employment. In order to reach this goal, the government increased child care funding
substantially, and eliminated the fragmentation in the child care system by consolidating
the previously existing four main child care funding streams into a single block grant,
called the Child Care Development Fund (CCDF). In 1999, child care subsidies were
estimated to be around $21 billion (Blau 2001). Today, child care subsidies are
considered an integral part of the government efforts to help low income families support
themselves by work rather than welfare as well as to support the development of lowincome children.
Because child care subsidies are often argued on the basis of increasing
employment, majority of the subsidies are in programs with strong employment
requirements.1 While placing restrictions on the use of subsidies with respect to the
employment dimension, the current child care system places a high priority on
maximizing parental choice with respect to the quality or the type of care chosen. The
vast majority of subsidies are distributed through vouchers that parents can use for any
legal child care provider, including relatives, in-home caregivers, family child care
homes, or centers (Blau 2003, Adams and Rohacek 2002). About 90% of children served
by CCDF subsidies in 2000 were served through voucher-based funding, which parents
could use in any of the setting listed above (Adams and Rohacek 2002). Child care

One exception is Head Start, which is designed to support the development of low-income children
specifically. Its goal is to subsidize high-quality care and it has no employment or training requirement.

providers must be licensed if state law requires it. If they are exempt from the licensing
requirement, they must meet basic health and safety standards. The regulations are
determined entirely by states. Although states can impose more stringent requirements,
these requirements must continue to accommodate maximum parental choice.
This paper provides evidence on the impact of the actual child care subsidy
receipt on the joint employment and child care mode decisions of single mothers in the
post-welfare reform period. The child care choices are categorized into four modes:
centers, family day care homes, relatives, and parental care. This is the first paper to
examine the impact of actual subsidy receipt on the joint employment and child care
mode decisions of single mothers of young children.
The evidence of the impact of actual subsidy receipt on the behavior of mothers of
young children is limited, mainly because of lack of data on child care subsidies. There
are only four studies examining the impact of actual subsidy receipt on the employment
decision of mothers and none of them considers the demand for specific child care
modes. Meyers, Heintze, and Wolf (2002) examine the impact of subsidy receipt on
employment of low-income single mothers in California. Gelbach (2002) estimates the
effect of the availability of free kindergarten on employment of mothers of five-year old
children. Berger and Black (1992) investigate the impact of two Kentucky child care
subsidy programs on employment of low-income single mothers. Blau and Tekin (2003)
separately estimate the effects of child care subsidy receipt on the employment, welfare,
unemployment, and schooling outcomes of single mothers using data from the National
Survey of America’s Families. All of these studies find a positive effect of subsidy
receipt on the employment decision of mothers. There is also a large number of studies

2

examining the impact of child care prices on employment and child care mode decisions
of mothers, motivated mainly to infer how child care subsidies would affect behavior.2
However, the price or fee effect may not be a proper measure of the child care subsidy
effect if there are substantial costs to taking up a subsidy, such as the stigma of
participating in a means-tested program (Blau 2003).
Most of the literature on the impact of child care costs on employment and child
care choice decisions focuses on married mothers. Another common characteristic of the
previous studies is that, with the exception of Blau and Tekin (2003), they use data from
the pre-welfare reform period. However, the results from the pre-reform studies may not
be a reliable guide to the current subsidy effects because of the substantial changes put in
place to the child care system by welfare reform (Blau 2003).
II. Data and Methodology
This study uses data from the 1999 National Survey of America’s Families
(NSAF). The NSAF sample is a representative of the United States population under age
65. Residents of the 13 states and households with income less than 200 percent of the
federal poverty line are over-sampled.3 The subsidy receipt variable is constructed from
the answers to the question of whether the mother receives any assistance paying for
child care, including assistance from a welfare or social services agency. The NSAF also
provides detailed information on the primary child care arrangement in which the child

For example, Anderson and Levine (2000), Connelly and Kimmel (1999), Kimmel (1995, 1998), Ribar
(1992, 1995), Blau and Robins (1998), Powell (1997, 1998) focus on the employment outcome. Leibowitz,
Waite, and Witsberger (1988), Lehrer (1989), Hofferth and Wissoker (1992), Cleveland and Hyatt (1993),
Chaplin et al. (1999), and Connelly and Kimmel (2000) estimate models of the demand for specific modes
of child care. However, only three studies, Blau and Hagy (1998), Powell (2002), and Michalopoulos and
Robins (2002) examine the joint employment and child care mode decisions.

population.

spends the most number of hours each week.4 To be consistent with the literature, the
choice of child care mode is collapsed into four categories: center care, family day care,
relative care, and parental care.5 One-hundred-thirty-four mothers who reported working
while providing parental care for their children are excluded from the sample. This
exclusion is grounded on the basis that very few single mothers will have that option
available to them and one would expect their decision-making regarding employment and
child care choices to differ from those who do not have that option (Powell 2002).6 After
applying these criteria, the sample used in the analysis contains 2,226 single mothers with
at least one child under the age of 6. Definitions and descriptive statistics for variables
are displayed in Table 1. About 35 percent of the sample (766 mothers) use parental care.
Among working mothers, 38 percent (551 mothers) use center care, 21 percent (305
mothers) use family day care, and 41 percent (584 mothers) use relative care. About 17
percent of the mothers in the sample report receiving a child care subsidy. The
Administration for Children and Families (2000) predicts that about 12-15 percent of all
eligible families received a CCDF subsidy in 1998-2000. However, the national figure
includes all children under age 13 whereas the sample used in this paper contains only

4

In the NSAF, child care information is collected for up to two randomly chosen children, one between
ages 0-5 and the other between ages 6-12. They are called focal children in the NSAF. Most of other
studies use arrangement for the youngest child in each of these age categories because this is what is
provided in their data.
5
Family day care includes non-relative care in child’s home (e.g. care by a baby-sitter) or out of child’s
home. This is the typical classification used in previous studies.
6
There are 72 mothers whose children are enrolled in Head Start. 26 of them reported receiving a subsidy.
These 26 mothers are classified here as subsidy recipients because it is not possible to determine from the
data whether these cases receive an employment-related child care subsidy in addition to Head Start.
Estimation of the models with these cases reclassified as not receiving a subsidy produced similar results.

children under age 6. Thus, the subsidy coverage in the sample is not unreasonable.
Other statistics are also consistent with those usually reported in other studies.7
A cross-classification of the four modes with the binary employment decision
results in a multinomial choice model with following four alternatives: (1) mother does
not work and therefore does not use non-maternal care, (2) mother works and uses center
care, (3) mother works and uses family day care, and (4) mother works and uses relative
care. Assume that the utility of the ith mother if she chooses alternative j is given by
Vij = Xiβj + αjSi + εij,

j=1,…..,4,

i = 1,…..,N

(1)

where Xi is a vector of observed characteristics of the mother i such as age, nonwage
income, health status, race, ethnicity, region of residence, number of children in different
age groups, education, and immigration status. Si is a binary indicator of subsidy receipt,
εij is an alternative specific disturbance, and β and α are the parameters to be estimated.
It must be noted that a structural model would normally include the wage rate. However,
the determinants of the wage rate are substituted into equation (1) since wage effect is not
the focus of this paper. Thus, equation (1) is really a quasi-reduced form model.
According to (1), the mother i will choose alternative j if Vij > Vik for all k ≠ j.
Assuming that the ε’s are drawn from independent extreme-value distributions, equation
(1) can be estimated using a multinomial logit model. However, the coefficient estimate
on the subsidy receipt is likely to be biased due to endogeneity for several reasons. For
example, mothers with strong preferences for work (alternatives 2-4) may be more
motivated to seek a child care subsidy. Alternatively, mothers with the least employment
7

It turns out that every single mother has at least one relative present in the household since the variable,
the number of relatives, has a range from 1 to 11 in the sample. This supports the inclusion of relative care
as an alternative in the multinomial choice model. However, for estimation purposes, it is not crucial that
every mother has the option of relative care because the choice set for those who do not have that option
could be reduced to the first three alternatives in that case.

5

qualifications may be given priority for subsidies by administrators. Therefore, the
estimation of a binary model of child care subsidy receipt is necessary to account for
possible bias that would contaminate the actual impact of subsidies on the behavior of
single mothers. A subsidy receipt equation can be specified as follows:
Si = Xiδ+ Ziζ + υi,

(2)

where Zi is a vector of identifying instruments, and υi is a disturbance with mean zero. Zi
includes the percent of eligible children served by child care subsidies in the state, the
average amount of CCDF funds spent per child in the state, and a binary variable
indicating whether the state uses mass media as a consumer education strategy for the
child care subsidies. These variables are assumed to affect whether a single mother
receives a child care subsidy or not, but they have no impact on her employment or child
care mode decisions.
The estimation of equation (1) with a multinomial logit model may be
problematic because of the independence of irrelevant alternatives assumption, which
imposes the error terms, εij‘s, to be independent across alternatives. For example, if a
mother has unobserved preferences for work, these preferences will appear in all the
alternatives (2-4) in which the mother is employed. It is likely, for example, that the
decision to work while using center care is closely related to the decision to work while
using family day care. With the exception of Blau and Hagy (1998), all of the previous
studies that estimate a multinomial logit model failed to guard against this potential
problem, mainly due to computational difficulty.8 Following Blau and Hagy (1998), a

8

These include Blau and Robins (1988), Hoffeth and Wissoker (1992), Cleveland and Hyatt (1993),
Chaplin et al. (1999), Michalopoulos and Robins (2000), and Connelly and Kimmel (2000), and owell
(2002). In this group, only Powell (2002) and Chaplin et al. (2000) implement a Hausman Test to test the
validity of the independence of irrelevant alternatives assumption.

6

discrete random effects specification is used in this paper to allow for the possibility of
correlation in the disturbances across the discrete alternatives. Furthermore, the subsidy
receipt equation is estimated jointly with the multinomial choice equation to allow for the
possibility of correlation between εij‘s and υi.9 To implement the discrete random effects
specification, the following factor structure is imposed on the disturbances in equations
(1) and (2):
εij = uij + ρjη,

(3)

υi = µi + ρsη,

(4)

where uij, µi, and η are mutually independent disturbances, the ρ’s are factor loadings that
allow for flexibility in the effect of a given factor across equations. This structure places
the restriction that all correlation across error terms enters the model through the common
factor η that is assumed to have a discrete distribution (Heckman and Singer1984).
Specifically,
Pr(η = θk) = pk,

k=1,…..,K, pk ≥ 0,

and

K

∑p

=1,

k =1

Where θk is the kth point of support in the distribution of η, pk is the probability that the η
takes on the value of θk, and K is the number of points in the support of the distribution of
η. This assumption is much less restrictive than the common practice of specifying a
functional form of the distribution of the η’s. Under these specifications, the likelihood
function contribution for mother i associated with equations (1) and (2) is given by
Li =

Mroz (1999) finds that this discrete random effects specification is more robust to deviations from
normality and quality of instruments than two-stage methods. See Mocan and Tekin (2003), Picone et al.
(2003), and Hu (1999) for other examples of this method.

Assuming that the uij‘s in equation (3) are drawn from independent extreme-value
distributions, Prij(θk) =

and α1 set to zero for identification.10 Specifying a logit for the binary subsidy receipt
equation, one gets Pr(Si = 1| θk) =

. The parameters to be

III. Results
The results of the child care subsidy receipt model are presented in Table 2.11 The
marginal effects of the logit coefficients are displayed in the first column and the
underlying coefficients are displayed in the second column. The standard errors are
presented in the third column. Single mothers with a high school and some college
degree are 7.6 and 11.4 percentage points more likely to receive a child care subsidy than
others. Black are more likely to receive a subsidy than whites and other races. Those
living in the West and Midwest are more likely to receive a subsidy than those living in
the South or Northeast. Mothers who were born in the U.S. are 5.1 percentage points

The models are estimated with different points of support (K). The results presented in the paper are
taken from a model with five points of support. A model with six points of support did not improve the
likelihood function value significantly and the results were very similar. The estimated factor loadings and
heterogeneity parameters are presented in Table 5. As Table 5 illustrates, most of these estimates are
statistically significant.

more likely to receive a subsidy than others. Higher non-wage income reduces the
likelihood of subsidy receipt, but the estimated effect is small. A 1,000 increase in nonwage income would induce about a 1 percentage point decrease in the probability of
subsidy receipt. The presence of an additional relative in household reduces the
likelihood of subsidy receipt by about 2 percentage points.
Each of three identifying instruments is a significant determinant of the first stage
outcome, the probability of subsidy receipt. State’s use of mass media as a consumer
education strategy is associated with a 4.7 percentage increase in the likelihood of
subsidy receipt. A one percentage increase in the percent of eligible children served in the
state increases the likelihood of child care subsidy receipt by about 0.4 percentage points.
Finally, a 1,000 dollar increase in the annual amount of CCDF funds spent per child
increases the likelihood of subsidy receipt by about 1.3 percentage points. The three
estimates are statistically significant individually. Furthermore, a specification test
rejected that they are jointly zero at less than 0.001 level of significance. In order to
support further evidence on the validity of the instruments, they were included in the
second stage multinomial choice model. Most of the nine coefficients of these three
variables are found to be insignificant and a specification test failed to reject the
hypothesis that they are jointly zero.
Results of the multinomial choice model are displayed in Table 3 and the
corresponding marginal effects are presented in Table 4.12 The effects of explanatory
12

For binary variables, the marginal effects are calculated for each mother as the difference of the
probability of choosing a particular alternative when the binary variable equals 1 and the probability of
choosing that alternative when the binary variable is 0. Since the probability of choosing an alternative i,
Pr(i), is a function of the heterogeneity parameters, each probability is integrated over the heterogeneity
distribution. These values are then averaged over the sample. The marginal effect for the continuous
variables is, βPr(i)[1-Pr(i)], which is again calculated for each mother, integrating over the heterogeneity
distribution. This is again averaged over the sample.

variables are mostly as expected. Nonwage income has a small but negative impact on
employment, indicating that leisure is a normal good. Having an additional child under
age 5 lowers the probability of work by 10 percentage points. A similar pattern is
observed for the impact of older children, although the magnitude is smaller. Education
also appears to be an important factor explaining the choices of work and child care.
Better educated single mothers are much more likely to work and use formal child care
arrangements like center care and family day care.
As illustrated in Table 4, child care subsidy receipt increases the probability of
choosing alternatives in which the mother is employed (alternatives 2-4) by a total of
15.3 percentage points. This result is consistent with the economic theory because child
care subsidy receipt effectively reduces the size of an important work-related expense,
child care costs. Based on the marginal effects of subsidy receipt for alternatives (2)-(4),
it is also clear that the receipt of subsidies are overwhelmingly used for center care by the
employed mothers. Not only non-employed mothers are moving from parental care to
employment and center care, a sizeable proportion of employed single mothers are
moving from relative care to center care when they receive child care subsidies.
Specifically, subsidy receipt increases the probability of working and using center care by
33.2 percentage points while decreasing the probability of working and using relative
care by 16.2 percentage points. The finding that child care subsidies decrease the use of
parental care is consistent with other studies (e.g. Michalopoulos and Robins 2000,
Powell 2002, Hofferth and Wissoker 1992, and Michalopoulos et al. 1992). The overall
impact on employment and on using family day care is negative but small in magnitude.
These results may suggest that single mothers perceive center care of better quality than

10

either family day care centers or relative care. Alternatively they may be switching to
center care in order to release relatives from the child care requirement if relatives divide
their time between leisure and child care (Blau and Tekin 2003). Also, the potentially
constrained size of the “relative market” may play a role in the use of such care compared
with the potential size of the market for center care (Powell 2002). In fact, controlling for
subsidy receipt, the number of relatives in the household has a significant and positive
effect on the probability of choosing relative care.
IV. Conclusion

Based on the significant and sizeable effect of subsidy receipt on employment,
results presented in this paper support the view that child care subsidies are instrumental
in helping welfare reform reach its goal of increased employed. Results also indicate that
the increase in employment will likely to involve a substantial move away from relative
care toward center-based care. If one believes that parental or relative care has higher
quality than nonparental market care, these findings may seem troublesome.
Michalopoulos et al. (1992) argue that subsidies would encourage mothers to work, but
they would replace high-quality parental care with potentially low-quality nonparental
care. However, there is little evidence about the relative merits for the child of different
types of care.13 Given the current policy of encouraging mothers to enter the workforce,
women have little choice but to use non-maternal care.

13

On one hand, a positive parenting style characterized by warm, supportive interaction between parent
and child may have favorable effects on child’s development (Campbell 1995, Landy and Tam 1996).
Some psychologists argue that appropriate care requires that the mother should provide primary care until
the child reaches the age of 3 (White 1975). However, one cannot be sure that a child receives adequate
care without the knowledge about the actual dynamics of the relationship between children and parents in
the sample. On the other hand, children, especially those aged 3-5, may benefit from interaction with other
children and with an adult trained in early childhood education (Berk 1985). Also, center care is often
argued to be of better quality and more reliable than relative care and parental care since relative and
parental care are largely to be custodial (Kimmel 1994).
