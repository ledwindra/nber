It also develops a detailed description of private pension structures and the ways in which pensions reward deferred retirement. The data imply that the present discounted value of total lifetime income rises when people postpone retirement, but the size of the income increment varies with age. The data also show that some pension plans encourage early retirement while others penalize it.\n\n",
