The conclusion reached is that only under special assumptions are such linkages justified.  Using these special assumptions of Cobb-Douglas or CES production functions and preferences, a final section of the paper presents empirical estimates of how trade may have affected the U.S. wage gap between more educated and less educated workers in recent years.\n\n",
