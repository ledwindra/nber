    "abstract": "\n\nBuilding energy efficiency is a cornerstone of greenhouse gas mitigation strategies with billions of dollars set aside for extensive upgrades in the coming years. However, impact evaluations have revealed actual energy savings from home upgrade programs often fall short of projections, in part due to contractor underperformance. Using field experiment results, we show refining one program design element\u2014offering performance bonuses to contractors\u2014 increased natural gas savings by 24% and generated $5.39-$14.53 in social benefits per dollar invested. Hence, changes to worker incentives can have sizable impacts on the cost effectiveness of GhG abatement in energy efficiency programs.\n\n",
