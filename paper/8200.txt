I. Introduction
Virtually every industrialized country has passed laws mandating equal treatment of
women in the labor market. Yet the gender wage gap, while on the decline in many countries, is
a persistent feature of virtually every nation's labor market. Moreover, the extent to which men
outearn women varies substantially across countries as well. Among the sample of 22 countries
shown in Table 1 below, the gap in log earnings corrected for differences in weekly work hours
between men and women averaged .307 log points over the 1985-94 period.1 The standard
deviation of these gaps across countries was .145 log points, and the interquartile range (75-25
difference) in gender pay gaps across countries was .124 log points. In this paper, we attempt to
explain these international differences.
Economists have traditionally looked to gender-specific factors such as female shortfalls
in human capital or employer discrimination against women to explain the size of the gender pay
gap and its evolution over time. However, beginning with the work of Juhn, Murphy and Pierce
(1991), economists have recognized that overall wage structure, or the prices the labor market
attaches to skills and the rents accruing to those in favored sectors, can have a major impact on
the relative wages of different subgroups in the labor market. The logic behind this insight is
straightforward. For example, since women have on average less labor market experience than
men and tend to work in different occupations and industries, an increase in the return to
experience or in sectoral differentials will raise the gender pay gap, all else equal. As we have
pointed out in our earlier work (Blau and Kahn 1992; 1995; and 1996b), the same reasoning
applies across countries: countries with relatively high rewards to skill and relatively large
sectoral differentials will tend to have larger gender pay gaps, ceteris paribus. International
comparisons provide a particularly fertile field in which to study the effects of wage structure on
pay differentials between men and women because, due in part to substantial international
differences in wage setting institutions (Blau and Kahn 1996a), they provide greater variation in

This is an unweighted average of the raw gender pay gaps by country presented in Table 2. Below, we explain in
detail how the estimated pay gaps were obtained.

wage dispersion and labor market rewards than may generally be obtained by shifts in wage
structure over time within a country. An important implication of this approach is that the
factors that influence overall wage structure such as supply of and demand for skills and wagesetting institutions may well be extremely important determinants of international differences in
the gender pay gap and, by implication, of trends in the gender pay gap within countries as well.
In previous work on international differences in the gender pay gap (Blau and Kahn,
1992, 1995; 1996b), we used this insight to address a paradox: while the relative qualifications of
American women are high compared to women in other countries and the United States has had
a longer and often stronger commitment to anti-discrimination laws than most economicallyadvanced nations, the United States has traditionally been among the countries with the largest
gender gaps. Due in part to its decentralized wage setting institutions, the US labor market
places a much larger penalty on those with lower levels of labor market skills (both measured
and unmeasured) or who are located in less-favored sectors of the labor market. These are
disproportionately women, whose relative wages are thus potentially reduced by labor market
institutions in the US. Based on pair-wise comparisons of the United States to nine other
advanced countries, we presented evidence that the higher level of wage inequality in the United
States is the primary reason for its relatively high gender pay gap. 2
Specifically, using a decomposition technique developed by Juhn, Murphy and Pierce
(1991), we simulated the gender pay gap that would result if other countries had the overall wage
structure of the US. We found that each simulated "other country" gender pay gap would be
virtually as large as or larger than the US gap under this counterfactual, implying that differences
in overall wage structure usually completely accounted (or in several cases more than completely
accounted) for the US-other country differences in the gender pay gap. 3 In these comparisons, it
2

The countries were Australia, Austria, Britain, Hungary, Italy, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and West Germany.
This framework has been subsequently adopted by other researchers who have also found evidence of the impact
of wage-setting institutions on the gender gap in pay. Kidd and Shannon (1996) found that 37-66 percent of the
smaller gender pay gap in Australia than Canada in 1989-90 (a difference of .14 log points) was due to Australia’s
more compressed wage structure. Australia’s institution of nationally-binding wage awards issued by government
tribunals as well as its higher level of unionization are likely candidates for explaining its lower wage dispersion.
Similarly, Edin and Richardson (1999) found that when Sweden's solidarity bargaining was compressing the wage
3

2

was clear that relying on a framework that only considered gender-specific factors would have
been inadequate to explain the relatively high gender pay gap in the United States.
In this paper, we extend this analysis asking whether wage structure has an important
effect on the gender pay gap across a broad variety of countries. That is, while wage structure
may be the most important reason for the relatively high gender pay gap in the United States,
does this framework explain a large component of international differences in the gender pay gap
generally? Moreover, while our earlier research using two-country comparisons and the Juhn,
Murphy, and Pierce (1991) decomposition suggested a strong role for wage inequality and wagesetting institutions in affecting the gender gap, it did not directly test this effect. The technique
assumes that women will be affected by the same forces that influence the male wage
distribution in a country. Specifically, the estimated male prices of measured characteristics are
assumed to affect men and women in the same way and the residuals from a male wage
regression are decomposed into a portion reflecting the prices of unmeasured skills and a portion
reflecting the quantities of unmeasured skills. Taking the US and Sweden as an example, the
decomposition of the residual assumes that, controlling for measured characteristics, if Swedish
women with wage residuals equal to, say, the 35th percentile of the Swedish male residual wage
distribution were moved to the US they would have wage residuals equal to the 35th percentile of
the American male residual wage distribution. This type of decomposition has been criticized by
Suen (1997). In this paper, we are able to implement a more direct test of this idea which
provides considerable empirical support for our earlier findings and thus indirectly for the Juhn,
Murphy, and Pierce decomposition technique.
Some support for the notion that wage structure is important may be found in Rowthorn's
observation, based on tabulations of aggregate wage data on 17 countries in 1973 and 1985, that
the gender pay gap tended to be lower in countries with more centralized wage setting

distribution at the bottom during the 1968-74 period, the gender pay gap in Sweden fell by .06 log points; 82% of
this decline was due to the compression of the wage structure.

institutions as measured by industrial relations researchers (Calmfors and Driffill, 1988).4 In
addition, in earlier work, we found a positive (though insignificant) correlation between a
country’s gender pay gap and the degree of decentralization of its wage setting across a small
sample of ten countries primarily from the late 1980s (Blau and Kahn, 1996b).
In this study, we use micro-data on 22 countries over the 1985-94 period to test whether
more egalitarian pay structures (as measured by the extent of male wage inequality) are
associated with lower gender pay gaps. In contrast to studies based on published data from
sources such as the ILO or the OECD, our micro-data on individual workers allow us to adjust
for international differences in women’s human capital in estimating the gender pay gap, an
important step in isolating the impact of wage structure. Data on individuals are also essential in
estimating the characteristics of the wage structure itself if we are to separate out labor force
heterogeneity from the true effects of labor market prices. A further contribution of the current
study is that we are able to estimate the impact of supply and demand conditions in the female
labor market on a country's gender pay gap.
Our results provide support for the idea that egalitarian wage structures reduce the gender
pay gap. We also find that, in some models, controlling for wage structure, the gender
differential is lower when women are in shorter supply relative to the favorableness of the
country’s demand structure for women (female “net supply”). These results hold equally
strongly even when we exclude the United States from the analysis, suggesting that the negative
relationship between wage compression and the gender pay gap is not driven by the extreme case
of the US. Thus, to the extent that institutions are a major factor leading to more or less
egalitarian wage structures (Blau and Kahn, 1996a), we find strong evidence for the importance
of institutions and some evidence for the effect of market forces in affecting the gender pay gap.
Moreover, the effect of pay structures on the gender pay gap is quantitatively very important: a
4

Rowthorn (1992) did not perform a statistical test of this hypothesis. However, using his reported data, we
regressed a country’s female/male hourly earnings ratio on its centralization rank (1=most centralized) and found a
coefficient of -.931 with a standard error of .410 in 1985; and a coefficient of -.946 with a standard error of .307 in
1973. Thus there appears to be a stable negative relationship at the aggregate level between decentralization of
wage-setting and the female/male pay ratio in the 1970s and 1980s.

4

large part of the difference in the gender differential between high gap and low gap countries is
explained by the differences across these countries in overall wage structure, with another
potentially important segment due to differences in female net supply.

II. The Institutional Setting
In this section we briefly summarize international differences in gender-specific policies
and basic wage-setting institutions and their expected effects on the gender pay gap. Human
capital is also a major determinant of gender pay gaps, and, in the work below, we control for
international differences in women’s measured human capital compared to men. However,
international variation in policies and institutions appear to be more dramatic than those in
women's relative human capital levels, at least in our sample. Further, human capital can be
affected by such policies and institutions as discussed below. Differences across countries in
institutions which affect the gender pay gap may be classified into those that are gender-specific
and those that affect the wage structure in general.
Gender-specific policies include equal employment opportunity (EEO) and antidiscrimination laws, as well as laws and policies governing parental leave and child care
availability. The expected positive effect of EEO policies on the gender earnings ratio is
reasonably straightforward, although the impact will most likely depend on the effectiveness of
the legislation’s enforcement as well as its provisions. In general, it is expected that, given
considerable segregation of women by occupation, firm, and industry, equal pay laws mandating
equal pay for equal work within the same occupation and firm will have a relatively small effect.
Laws requiring equal opportunity, hiring preferences, and/or "comparable worth" (i.e., equal pay
for work of equal value to the firm, regardless of specific occupational category) have potentially
larger impacts. In addition, since EEO laws involve occupational shifts, they may require
considerable time to have an impact on pay. Thus, the comparable worth approach which
provides for immediate increases in relative pay in female-dominated occupations may be

5

expected to have the largest initial wage effect, possibly accompanied by a negative impact on
female employment.5
Virtually all OECD and European Community countries had passed equal pay and equal
opportunity laws by the mid-1980s, although the US implemented its anti-discrimination
legislation before most other countries (OECD, 1988, pp. 167-168; Simona 1985). Of the
Eastern European countries in our sample, only Russia and Hungary were listed by the ILO
(1994) as having anti-discrimination laws as of 1994; the other Eastern European nations in our
sample—Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Poland, and Slovenia—were not included in the ILO
listing.6 However, Brainerd (2000) reports that under socialism in Eastern Europe and the Soviet
Union, there were government guarantees of equal pay for equal work, and women’s labor force
participation was encouraged. One country with perhaps the strongest intervention against sex
discrimination is Australia, the only one to have implemented a national policy of comparable
worth through its labor courts (Gregory and Daly, 1991; Killingsworth, 1990).7 Comparable
worth pay policies remain rare in the US private sector, although they have been adopted by a
number of state and local governments (Blau, Ferber and Winkler 1998).
The expected impact of family leave (disproportionately taken by women even when it is
available to men) is unclear a priori. On the one hand, such policies may raise the relative
earnings of women by encouraging the preservation of their ties to particular firms and hence
increasing the incentives of employers and women workers to invest in firm-specific training.
On the other hand, the existence of such policies could increase the incidence and/or duration of
temporary labor force withdrawals among women, raising the gender gap for the affected group.
Further, the incremental costs associated with mandated leave policies may increase the

5

For evidence on these employment effects, see, for example, Killingsworth (1990) and Gregory and Duncan
(1981).

Russia’s law prohibited discrimination against pregnant women.
7
Switzerland incorporated the principle of equal pay for work of equal value into its constitution in 1981 (Simona
1985), but there is no indication that it has been implemented as yet. And, in 1991, Ontario required virtually all
employers to practice the principles of comparable worth, but other Canadian provinces have not passed such
legislation (Gunderson and Robb 1991).

6

incentives of employers to discriminate against women. In Germany, for example, where
mandated parental leave is of long duration, it was reportedly legal for employers to discriminate
against pregnant women (Demleitner 1992).
By international standards, the United States has a relatively weak entitlement to parental
leave, consisting of an unpaid 13-week mandated period, which was only introduced in 1993. In
contrast, other OECD countries implemented mandated leave earlier and most have a much
longer period of leave, usually paid (Ruhm, 1998). While the theoretical effect of parental leave
on the gender gap is ambiguous, some research on the impact of parental leave has found a
positive effect of short leave entitlements on women's relative wages, although extended leaves
have been found to have the opposite effect (Ruhm, 1998; Waldfogel, 1998). In some
specifications below, we are able to control for the duration of parental leave entitlement, which
in our data ranged from 0 to 156 weeks, although these data are not available for our full set of
countries.
Child care is another important area of public policy which particularly affects women,
but one which is difficult to summarize across a large set of countries. Although we were unable
to secure data for an extended set of countries, some available evidence suggests that, as of the
mid-1980s, the United States had a smaller share of young children in publicly funded child care
than many other OECD countries, but provided relatively generous tax relief for child care
expenses (Gornick, Myers and Ross, 1997).
With respect to wage structure, there is a considerable body of evidence showing that
wage-setting institutions affect a country’s level of wage inequality. These institutions take the
form of collective bargaining conventions, minimum wage laws, and governmentally mandated
extensions of the terms of collective bargaining agreements to nonunion workers (Blau and Kahn
1999). In general, more heavily unionized economies in which collective bargaining takes place
at highly centralized levels have been found to have the lowest overall wage dispersion (Freeman
1988; Rowthorn 1992; Blau and Kahn 1996a).

7

It seems likely that systems of centrally-determined pay also entail smaller gender wage
differentials for at least two reasons related to their impact on skill prices and sectoral
differentials. First, in the US, a significant portion of the male-female pay gap is associated with
interindustry or interfirm wage differentials that result from its relatively decentralized-pay
setting institutions (Blau, 1977; Johnson and Solon, 1986; Sorensen, 1990; Groshen, 1991; and
Bayard, Hellerstein, Neumark, and Troske, 1999). Thus, centralized systems which reduce the
extent of wage variation across industries and firms are likely to lower the gender differential, all
else equal. Second, since in all countries the female wage distribution lies below the male
distribution, centralized systems that consciously raise minimum pay levels, regardless of
gender, will also tend to lower male-female wage differentials. Finally, the impact of genderspecific policies to raise female wages may be greater under centralized systems where such
policies can be more speedily and effectively implemented.8
There is considerable variation across countries, both in collective bargaining coverage
and in the degree of centralization of wage-setting in both the union and nonunion sectors.
Among the OECD nations, the Scandinavian countries and Austria stand at one extreme with
their high degree of collective bargaining coverage and union-negotiated wage agreements at the
economy-wide or industry-wide level, while the US stands at the other extreme with an
especially low rate of collective bargaining coverage and pay setting which is often determined
at the plant-level even within the union sector. Moreover, in many of the OECD countries, but
not in the US, formal or informal mechanisms exist to extend union-negotiated pay rates to
nonunion workers. In some specifications below we look directly at the effect of collective
bargaining coverage on the gender pay gap and find evidence of the expected negative effect.
Systems of pay compression may influence workers’ incentives to invest in skill
acquisition, although the direction of these effects is theoretically ambiguous. On the one hand,
if the return to experience is reduced by wage compression, women will have less incentive to
8

An example of this is provided by the case of Australia when the adoption of comparable worth by the labor
courts produced the rapid increase in the gender earnings ratio (e.g., Gregory and Daly, 1991; Killingsworth, 1990).

8

remain employed during periods of childbearing and childrearing than in countries where there is
a larger penalty for time out of the paid labor force. In our data, as well as in most microdata, we
are unable to measure actual experience; thus, this type of labor supply response of women to
pay compression will go largely undetected. This could bias us away from finding a positive
effect of reduced male wage inequality and wage-compressing institutions on the relative pay of
women, controlling for their measured, as opposed to actual, human capital levels. On the other
hand, high wage floors may encourage women's labor force participation, raising their relative
experience levels. Of course, these wage floors could still reduce women's employment if labor
demand effects are important. In any case, wage-induced changes in female qualifications could
produce a positive or a negative bias on our estimates of the impact of wage compression.
Another institution that directly affects the wage distribution is mandated minimum wage
coverage. Studies of the impact of minimum wages in various countries on the wage distribution
invariably find that such regulation compresses the bottom of the distribution (Card and Krueger
1995; DiNardo, Fortin and Lemieux 1996; Machin and Manning 1994; Katz, Loveman and
Blanchflower 1995; Dolado, et. al 1996). And Blau and Kahn (1997) concluded that falling real
minimum wages over the 1980s retarded the narrowing of the pay gap between low-skill women
and low skill men. International differences in minimum wage levels, both those negotiated in
collective bargaining and those imposed by government, are likely to be reflected in our
measures of male wage inequality. Below, we also present some results designed to explicitly
assess the impact of minimum wages on the gender pay gap.
An alternative perspective on these issues is provided in a recent paper by Fortin and
Lemieux (1998). They suggest that relative gains for women can affect male wage inequality, in
effect posing the opposite direction of causality to the one posited here.9 As they point out, their
approach is consistent with a pure job assignment model in which alterations in the relative
position of women in the wage distribution do not affect the overall distribution of wages. This
9

We note that this reasoning applies whether women’s gains come through reductions in discimination or through
improvements in women’s relative human capital levels.

raises the possibility that a reduction in the gender gap could increase male inequality (as some
women move up the wage distribution and some men move down); and they present some
evidence consistent with this for the US over the 1980s. To the extent that female gains do come
to some degree from male losses, this reverse causation will impose a negative bias on the
measured effect of male inequality on the gender gap. In addition, in some specifications
presented below, we attempt to avoid the simultaneity problem by taking a reduced form
approach in which institutional variables such as collective bargaining coverage, minimum
wages, unemployment insurance generosity, and the degree of employment protection take the
place of our measures of male inequality and female net supply.

III. Description of the Data
In this study, we use microdata from the 1985-94 annual files of the International Social
Survey Programme (ISSP). The ISSP is a voluntary grouping of study teams in over twenty
countries “each of which undertakes to run a short, annual self-completion survey containing an
agreed set of questions asked of a probability-based, nation-wide sample of adults.” (ISSP
documentation file, 1992). In addition to its annual theme questions concerning social attitudes,
each year the ISSP administers a uniform set of questions on respondents’ education, earnings,
age, marital status, work hours and gender. The sample design is a new random cross-section in
each available year for every country, with the exception of data for Australia in 1986, 1987,
1991, and 1994, and Hungary in 1990-94 which are panel follow-up samples. Our results were
virtually identical when we excluded these country-year observations from the data.
The sample of countries with available wage data varies from year to year and is shown
in Table 1.10 Each country appears an average of 4.5 times during this period yielding a total of
100 country-year observations. As may be seen in the table, the coverage of countries has grown

10

Data were also available for Spain in 1993, but were not included here because the estimated gender gap, .061,
was not credible in comparison to other sources. Data on Australia for 1985 were also excluded due to data
problems noted in Blau and Kahn (1995).

10

from a relatively small number (four) in 1985 to seventeen countries with usable data in 1994. A
particularly interesting feature of the ISSP sample is the addition of several Eastern European
countries, including the former East Germany, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Bulgaria, Russia,
Slovenia, and Poland, mostly after 1990.
Table 1 also shows the earnings concept for each country. Unfortunately there are some
differences across countries in the exact definitions of the income variables in the ISSP data.
While in over half the cases the income data are measured before taxes, income is measured after
taxes in the remainder. Although this difference is of some concern, it is reassuring that the
empirical results reported below were not affected by the inclusion of a dummy variable
indicating that net income was the income concept employed, nor was the coefficient for this
dummy variable ever significant. In addition, because of the different possible tax treatment of
single vs. married women and the issue of before vs. after tax earnings, we estimate some
supplementary models confining ourselves to married workers only, in addition to our basic
specification that includes all workers. Our results are very similar for the married subsample,
providing some further indication that differing income definitions do not have a major impact
on our results.
As may also be seen in the table, with the exception of Ireland in 1993 and 1994,
earnings are computed on either an annual or a monthly basis; thus, in general, we are not able to
compute hourly or weekly earnings (the ISSP does not collect information on weeks worked).
However, we do have information on hours worked per week, which as described below, we use
to estimate earnings adjusted for time input. Since the national surveys that comprise the ISSP
can change their focus from year to year, variables such as industry and union membership are
not consistently available. However, occupational information is available for most country-year
observations and we use it in several of our analyses. Finally, it may be noted that not every
country participates in every year, a factor that further contributes to the unbalanced nature of the
country-year panel.

11

IV. Estimation Strategy
Our analysis begins with log earnings equations estimated separately by sex for each
country j and year t, where i indexes individuals:

(1)

LnEARNijt = b0jt + b1jtPARTijt + b2jtHRPARTijt + b3jtHRFULLijt + XijtBjt + eijt,

where LnEARN is the natural log of earnings; PART is a dummy variable for part-time
employment defined as less than 35 hours per week;11 HRPART and HRFULL are interactions
of weekly work hours with part- and full-time status; X is a vector of explanatory variables
described below; and e is an error term. The model allows for both a part-time shift term and
different slopes for hours for part-time and full-time workers. A detailed adjustment for parttime employment is important in light of the prevalence of part-time work for women in many
countries. We use a linear specification for the hours variable and its interactions with the part
time and full time dummies as part of a relatively unrestricted simple specification intended to
capture the variation in labor input, given that we do not have information on weeks worked.
Results were virtually identical when we used log hours instead of hours in equation (1).
The PART, HRPART and HRFULL coefficients from (1) were used to adjust each
person's earnings for work hours by assuming a 40 hour work week. That is, for each worker i,
we have (suppressing the country and year subscripts):

(2)

LnEARN(40)i = lnEARNi - b1PARTi - b2HRPARTi - b3(HRFULLi - 40)

where the coefficients, bn, are obtained from estimating equation (1) for males (m) and females
11

Countries may differ in their definitions of part time. Until 1997, the OECD used each country’s own definition
in reporting on the fraction of workers employed part-time. For our data period (1985-1994), this was 35 hours in
most cases, leading us to use the 35 hour definition here. Starting in 1997, in recognition of some recent trends in
the definition of full-time work, the OECD began using a common 30 hour cutoff in its statistics (see, for example,
OECD 1999). Because of changing norms with respect to what is considered full time work, we tested the
robustness of our results by using a 30 hour cutoff and obtained very similar findings to those reported below.

12

(f) separately. Thus, the gender difference in the mean of LnEARN(40) in a given year and
country is our best estimate of the gender gap in wage rates.12
The explanatory variables in X include the traditional human capital variables of
education and potential experience and its square, as well as a constant. Inclusion of marital
status as a human capital characteristic is problematic in that it is likely to be positively
associated with productivity for men but may be negatively so for women (e.g., Korenman and
Neumark, 1991). Because of this ambiguity, we do not control for marital status in the countryyear microdata wage regressions used to estimate human capital-adjusted gender pay gaps;
however, similar results were obtained when we did control for marital status and, as noted
above, when we confined the sample to married individuals. In our main specification, both the
self-employed and wage and salary workers are included in the regression sample, but, as
discussed below, results were similar when the sample was restricted to wage and salary workers
only. The rationale for including the self-employed is that the size of this sector may be
influenced by wage setting institutions. For example, in economies where wage determination is
heavily regulated, the self-employment sector may swell in an attempt to avoid such regulation.
In additional specifications for a subset of the country-year observations, we are able to
estimate models that control for one-digit occupation.13 We recognize that an individual’s
occupation is potentially endogenous because individuals may choose jobs on the basis of the
opportunities available; further, a country’s occupational structure may be affected by its wage
structure. However, occupation is also likely to be an important indicator of human capital and
may serve as a proxy for actual experience, which is not available in the ISSP. Thus, while we
present results not controlling for occupation, we also estimate supplementary specifications with
occupational controls. Our basic conclusions are robust with respect to this addition.
Having estimated (1) and (2) for each country and year (100 regressions for men and 100
12

We used this methodology in our earlier work (Blau and Kahn, 1992; 1995; 1996b) and obtained estimated
gender pay gaps that were similar in country rankings to those reported in published data based on average hourly
earnings.
13
As noted above, data on industry and unionism are not consistently available across our sample of countries.

13

for women), we then construct three different measures of the gender gap in hours-corrected
earnings. We begin with the estimated raw gender log wage gap:

(3)

TOTAL GAPjt ≡ LnEARN(40)mjt - LnEARN(40)fjt,

where LnEARN(40)mjt and LnEARN(40)fjt are, respectively, the average male and female levels
of log full-time earnings for country j and time t. The raw gender gap represents the net effect of
all of the forces that influence the gender gap in hours-corrected earnings. These include genderspecific effects influencing the male and female values of the explanatory variables X, the
impact of discrimination, and the impact of labor market prices as discussed above. Further, by
not conditioning on the X variables, when we use the raw gender gap as the dependent variable,
we allow the country's labor market prices to affect men's and women's incentives to acquire
these measured skills. As we have seen, wage compression may have opposing effects on
women's relative qualifications. Using TOTAL GAP as the dependent variable allows the net
effects of these processes to be observed.
While wage compression may, as argued above, affect women's and men's relative values
of X, there may also be exogenous (e.g., cultural) reasons for men and women to have different
relative levels of qualifications in different countries. For this reason, we primarily focus on
results based on the GAP US CHARS which estimates the predicted gender pay gap on the
assumption that the men and women in each country-year microdata file have the same average
levels of measured qualifications as US men and women for that year:

(4)

GAP US CHARSjt =(40b3mjt + XmutBmjt) - (40b3fjt + XfutBfjt),

where u refers to the United States, X is a vector of means of the explanatory variables for the
indicated group, and the subscripts f, m, and j have been defined above. Equation (4) provides a
simulated gender pay gap that removes international differences in women's relative levels of
14

measured characteristics. However, since gender differences in measured characteristics remain
(i.e., at the US levels) there is ample room for each country's wage structure to influence the
magnitude of the gender pay gap through its effects on the returns to the measured Xs. Finally,
note that equation (4) simulates full time earnings by valuing the country’s own male and female
full-time hours coefficients b3mjt and b3fjt at 40 hours.
A second specification of the gender gap that standardizes for international differences in
women's relative qualifications is the familiar "unexplained" gender pay gap:

(5)

UNEXPLAINED GAPjt = (40b3mjt + XfjtBmjt) - (40b3fjt + XfjtBfjt).

Equation (5) tells us the size of the gender pay gap in country j in year t that results from
unequal rewards for men and women of equal measured characteristics, using the country's
female mean characteristics as weights. This is often taken to be a measure of labor market
discrimination, although it will be influenced by gender differences in unmeasured
characteristics as well. Differences in the degree of wage compression across countries may
influence the size of the UNEXPLAINED GAP in at least two ways. First and most
straightforwardly, to the extent that there are gender differences in unmeasured characteristics
the size of the UNEXPLAINED GAP may be affected by international differences in the prices
of these unmeasured factors. Second, if discrimination takes the form of treating women of a
given skill level as being comparable to men with a lower skill level, compression of wages will
reduce the wage consequences of such actions. Although we examine some results for the
UNEXPLAINED GAP, for the reasons detailed above, we believe the GAP US CHARS is the
more appropriate measure.
Having described the construction of the basic dependent variables, we turn to the major
explanatory variables: male wage compression and the favorableness of supply relative to
demand for female labor. With respect to male wage compression, the simplest approach would
be to use a measure of observed male wage inequality. However, observed male wage inequality
15

is influenced by heterogeneity of productivity characteristics as well as by labor market prices,
and it is prices that generate the compression of wages that are associated with collective
bargaining institutions. To focus on prices, we construct two measures of male wage inequality
that remove the effects of measured heterogeneity.14 First, for each country and year, we take
the US sample of men for that year and compute a predicted log wage for each US male (ui)
using the male price structure for country j and year t:

(6)

(Xus)ijt = 40b3mjt + XuitBmjt.

We then compute measures of inequality, including the standard deviation and the 50-10 gap
across the American male sample (the ui’s) of these (Xus)ijt, which gives us a measure of the
degree of male inequality which results from the prices of measured human capital in country j in
year t. In this case we include a control for marital status in X since there is less ambiguity about
the effect of this variable among men. The rationale behind examining the 50-10 gap is that it is
a measure that may be especially relevant to those at the bottom of the distribution, such as
women. Note that we use the mean of (Xus)ijt to compute the male part of the GAP US CHARS
in equation (4). We use the inequality in the distribution of the (Xus)ijt as an indicator of the
compression caused by human capital prices.
Second, an insight of Juhn, Murphy and Pierce's (1991) work is that wage residuals also
potentially contain information about labor market prices, in this case the prices of unmeasured
characteristics. Accordingly, we also include as an explanatory variable the standard deviation
of (or the 50-10 gap in) the residuals from the male log wage equation estimated for country j in
year t. Note that the regression residual includes not only the returns to unmeasured individual
characteristics, but also industry and firm wage effects which we are not able to capture due to
data limitations in the ISSP. There is evidence that industry wage effects vary significantly
14

We have also estimated our models with the raw 50-10 male wage gap as the indicator of wage compression with
very similar results to those reported below.

16

across countries (Edin and Zetterberg 1992; Barth and Zweimüller 1992; Kahn 1998) and firm
wage effects are believed to do so as well (Teulings and Hartog, 1998).15 However, in addition
to containing information about unmeasured prices, residual inequality is also affected by other
factors including heterogeneity in unmeasured characteristics and measurement errors, while the
inequality in predicted wages is a direct measure of labor market prices.
In addition to labor market prices and relative human capital levels, we also expect
supply and demand conditions for women relative to men to influence the gender pay gap. If
men and women are viewed as imperfect substitutes in the labor market, as assumed in supply
and demand models of wage inequality (e.g., Katz and Murphy, 1992; Juhn, Murphy and Pierce,
1993; Bound and Johnson, 1992), then countries with higher demand for, or lower supplies of,
women relative to men will have smaller gender pay gaps, other things equal. To measure these
demand and supply factors, we construct demand and supply indexes for women relative to men
in a manner similar to those employed in the wage inequality literature.
Turning first to demand, we wish to know, for each country-year observation, how
favorable the composition of output by industry (and the consequent derived demand for labor) is
for women. Following Katz and Murphy (1992), we constructed the demand index, ln(1+∆Djt),
for women for each country j and year t relative to a base of 1989 in the US:

(7)

∆Djt = Σiciu89(Eijt - Eiu89)/Eiu89,

where i refers to one digit industry cell, ciu89 is the fraction of all US women workers who were
employed in industry i in 1989, Eijt is the share of total employment in industry i, for country j in
year t, Eiu89 is share of total employment in industry i in the US in 1989.16 The demand index

15

The increasing availability of matched firm-worker data should facilitate future efforts to assess international
differences in the magnitude of these firm effects (Abowd and Kramarz 1999).
16
Since data on industry were not consistently available across countries in the ISSP, we used published sources to
obtain this information for each country and year; see ILO (various issues).

17

thus measures the degree to which the country j year t industry structure favors women relative
to the US in 1989, using US weights.
Supply indexes ∆Sjt are computed as follows:

(8)

∆Sjt = lnFjt - lnFu89,

where Fjt is the share of country j’s workers in year t who were women, and Fu89 is the analogous
fraction for the US in 1989. Thus, the supply index shows the relative representation of women
in country j's work force, using the 1989 US share as the norm.
We may then compute net supply as:

(9)

∆NSjt = ∆Sjt - ln(1+∆Djt)

where ∆Djt and ∆Sjt are defined in equations (7) and (8) above. (Recall that all magnitudes are in
log points and have been normalized relative to the US in 1989.) As implied by Katz and
Murphy’s (1992) equilibrium model, differences across countries in the gender pay gap will be
positively related to differences in female net supply, ∆NSjt. Intuitively, the larger the supply of
women relative to demand in country j compared to the US, the worse women will fare in
country j compared to the US.
While this net supply index represents our best measure of the relative abundance of
women workers, we note that it is overstated (understated) for countries with relatively small
(large) gender pay gaps. This is the case because, while we seek a measure of the position of the
female relative supply curve in relation to the relative demand curve for female labor, our
measures are based on employment outcomes. This means that countries with a low (high)
gender pay gap will appear to have larger (smaller) female supply and smaller (larger) female
demand indexes than otherwise because of the movements of workers and firms along their
supply and demand schedules. Thus, the construction of the net supply index may lead to a bias
18

away from finding that relative scarcity of women raises their relative wages. Another problem
with this measure is that it does not reflect differences across countries or over time in the within
industry demand for women workers. Nonetheless, it is important to control for relative net
supply, since this is potentially a key determinant of women’s relative wages. Further, Topel
(1994) has argued that rising female labor supply has in fact contributed to rising male wage
inequality. This is based on the idea that women compete in the labor market with low skill
men.17 To the extent that this argument holds, our control for female net supply provides a
sharper test of the effect of male prices on the gender pay gap. We interpret the impact of male
prices as being their effect beyond any portion that may have been caused by female supply.
A final reason for including a measure of net supply concerns possible selection bias due
to the fact that we observe earnings only for those with jobs. In addition to adjusting for the
effect of relative scarcity on the gender gap, our control for net supply also accounts for the
impact of the selectivity of the female and male labor forces on the gender pay differential. Note
that we do not impose any functional form on this relationship, or even posit its sign. While it is
most straightforward to expect those in the labor market to have better wage offers than the
nonemployed, this need not be the case. Especially for women, it is possible that those out of the
labor force have better labor market opportunities than those at work, on average, but their home
productivity may be so high as to outweigh their higher wage offers. If this is the case,
selectivity will impart a positive bias to the estimated effect of female net supply on female
relative wages. Conversely, if the nonemployed have worse wage offers, then selectivity will
bias us toward a negative relationship between female net supply and female relative wages.
While our control for net supply makes us more confident than otherwise that selectivity biases
are not driving the results for the other explanatory variables, consideration of this issue implies

17

In earlier international work (Blau and Kahn 1996a), we did not find evidence of a consistent relationship
between female net supply and male wage inequality. Similarly, Juhn and Kim (1999) found little evidence that
female supply affected male wage inequality within the United States; see also Blau and Kahn (1997).

19

that we must be cautious about concluding that supply and demand have important effects on the
gender pay gap.
Labor market prices and female net supply form the basic explanatory variables for our
study of the determinants of the gender pay gap, as expressed in estimating equations of the
following form:

(10)

GENDER GAPjt = c0 + c1INEQ (Xus)jt + c2INEQ RESIDjt + c3NETSUPPLYjt
+ ΣsdsYRst + ejt,

where for each country j and year t, GENDER GAP is a measure of the gender log wage gap;
INEQ (Xus) is male inequality in measured prices; INEQ RESID male residual inequality;
NETSUPPLY is female net supply (as defined in equation 9); YRs is a dummy variable for year
s, with a range of 1986 to 1994 (1985 is the omitted year); e is an error term.18
To test for the robustness of our findings with respect to wage compression and net
supply, we add a number of controls for other policies, cultural differences, or other genderspecific factors that may influence the male-female pay gap. First, we control for whether a
country was in the former Eastern bloc and test whether the impact of compression and net
supply differ for these countries relative to the West. Second, using Ruhm and Teague (1997)
and Nickell and Layard (1999), we construct for a subset of our data, weeks of available parental
leave and its square.19 Parental leave information is available from these sources for 1981, 1991
and 1995. Since our data span 1985-94, we created an interpolated parental leave variable that
incorporates some time variation. Third, again for a subset of observations for which data were
available, we include a measure of the degree of occupational segregation by gender, using
Anker’s (1998) indexes which were based on 75 occupational titles. His indexes were collected
18

The control for year also provides an adjustment to the price variability terms which are computed using a given
year’s US male sample. Year dummies in effect control for differences over time in the composition of the US male
sample of workers in the ISSP.
19
The quadratic term is included in light of our earlier discussion of the impact of short vs. long parental leave
entitlements.

20

at one time, typically 1990 (see the data Appendix for further details). While this is not a timevarying measure, it includes a considerable amount of occupational detail, unlike published
sources or the ISSP. Several of these variables may be affected by the male-female pay gap; yet
each may also control for exogenous factors that influence the gender pay gap. Thus, one can
make arguments for including or for excluding these additional variables. As we show below,
our conclusions with respect to the effect of wage compression and net supply on the gender pay
gap are robust with respect to the inclusion of these variables.20
In formulating our estimation strategy, we begin by noting that equation (10) combines
two kinds of experiments: one is based upon between country differences in levels of the
dependent and explanatory variables, and the other is based upon within country changes in these
variables over time. Yet it is possible that these two sources of variation arise from different
sources and hence have different consequences. Our review of the institutional literature on
wage-setting suggests that there are long-standing international differences in wage-setting
mechanisms that lead to varying levels of wage compression and thus gender pay gaps. While
institutions may have changed in the 1980s and 1990s in a number of countries (Boeri 2000;
Katz 1993), it is likely that, in most cases, the dominant factor driving changes in labor market
prices within countries over time has been an increase in the demand for skilled workers due to
such factors as skill-biased technological change and international trade (e.g., Freeman and Katz
1995). These technological changes included within industry demand shifts that favored white
collar workers in general and thus, given traditional employment patterns, women relative to
men (Berman, Bound and Griliches 1994; Katz and Murphy 1992; Blau and Kahn 1997; Welch
2000; Fortin and Lemieux 2000).
If international differences in labor market prices are primarily driven by institutional
differences while within country changes are caused mostly by technological factors, time series

20

In some cases, these variables were not available for the full set of country-year observations, in which case we
omitted the observation from these particular analyses. The basic model of equation (10), with each of the three
dependent variables, showed very similar results on these subsamples.

21

correlations of wage inequality and the gender pay gap within a country may in some sense not
be comparable to cross-sectional associations between country averages of these variables. This
creates an ambiguity in the empirically observed relationship between male inequality and the
gender gap in the time series because our industry-based demand index will not be able to detect
within-industry technological changes that have increased the demand for women. Moreover,
while data limitations prevented us from formulating our demand indexes in terms of
occupation-industry cells, it is unlikely that the problem could be surmounted even were the
international data available at this level of disaggregation. Results of intertemporal studies
within the U.S. are consistent with substantial increases in the demand for women workers
within broad industry-occupation cells (Katz and Murphy 1992; Blau and Kahn 1997). An
added concern regarding the time series is that changes in the unmeasured characteristics of
women workers may have played a larger role in producing changes in the gender pay gap over
time than in causing differences across countries. Since male inequality has tended to increase
over time and the gender gap has tended to decrease, this would be another source of a possibly
spurious negative correlation between male prices and the gender pay gap in the time series.
Another econometric issue in estimating equation (10) is the possibility of reverse
causation. For example, as discussed above, Fortin and Lemieux (1998) posit a negative reverse
causality from the gender pay gap to the level of male wage inequality. Similarly, our earlier
discussion suggests that the gender pay gap is likely to negatively affect our measure of female
net supply through movements along demand and supply schedules. To the extent that such
reverse causation exists, OLS coefficients will be biased.
Finally, due to our use of cross-section, time-series data and the construction of our
dependent and explanatory variables, there are several reasons to suspect that the classical
assumptions regarding errors in least squares estimation are violated here. First, since there are
multiple observations on the same country, the error terms may be correlated across years within
a country. Second, the dependent variable is based on regression coefficients with their own
sampling variances. Thus, the errors are likely to be heteroskedastic. Third, some of the
22

explanatory variables are functions of regression coefficients and thus have sampling errors of
their own. 21
Because of the distinction between the sources of time series and cross-sectional variation
in labor market prices as well as the econometric problems detailed above, we estimate several
alternative models based on equation (10). First, as a baseline, we estimate (10) taking account
of heteroskedasticity using the Huber-White procedure and allowing the error terms within a
country to be correlated. Second, we estimate (10) adding country dummy variables. This is a
within-country experiment in which we examine the impact of changes over time within a
country. In principle, the within-country model can account for country-specific effects on the
gender gap that are correlated with the basic explanatory variables. While traditional panel data
models consider both between and within unit analyses as providing different estimates of the
same basic parameters, our discussion above suggests that in this case they may each be
measuring the effects of different phenomena.
A final econometric variation on the basic equation is to estimate reduced form models
where male wage structure and female net supply are replaced by underlying variables that
influence them. This portion of the analysis accounts for any reverse causality from the gender
pay gap to male wage inequality. In addition to controls for occupational segregation and
parental leave, we include a variety of labor market institutions, including collective bargaining
coverage, minimum wages as a fraction of the average wage, unemployment insurance (UI)
replacement rates, the maximum duration of UI benefit receipt, and indexes of mandated job
protection for both regular and temporary employment. The specific definitions and sources of
these variables are discussed in more detail below. Each of these institutional variables is likely
to influence the male wage distribution by affecting the floor under union wage-setting as well as
the strength of insiders' wage demands.22 The use of collective bargaining coverage rather than
21

Murphy and Topel (1985) suggest a procedure for correcting standard errors in such models. We used their
procedure in several of our basic models with no change in the results.
22
For further discussion on the impact of unemployment insurance and job protection on wage-setting see Blau and
Kahn (1999).

23

union density is important because in many countries there are pronounced differences between
the two and of course it is the former that determines the labor market impact of unions. As was
the case earlier in our discussion of parental leave and occupational segregation, in some cases
these institutional variables are not available for our full data set.
While we employ UI system characteristics and the degree of mandated job protection in
reduced form models (in addition to collective bargaining coverage), it is possible that these
variables differentially affect male and female wages and thus directly affect the gender pay gap.
On the one hand, men tend to be employed in more layoff prone industries (Blau and Kahn
1981). Thus, to the extent that more generous UI benefits and job protection lower the
compensating differential employers in cyclically sensitive industries must pay (Topel 1984),
male wage inequality and the gender pay gap may both be reduced. On the other hand, UI and
job protection strengthen the power of “insiders.” Given women’s greater likelihood of being
short-term workers, this may increase male wages more than female wages. Moreover, we make
a distinction between average replacement rates and the maximum replacement rate, which is
typically higher for low wage workers. The wedge between these two replacement rates is an
indicator of the degree to which the UI system affects the wage structure. Finally, regulations on
the use of temporary workers may be particularly relevant in affecting female labor supply.

V. Results
The means of our main dependent and explanatory variables are shown in Table 2 which
gives the unweighted averages across years for each country in our sample. The table shows a
large range across countries in the raw gender pay gap, which averaged from .14 in Slovenia to
.85 in Japan. Apart from these extremes, the countries with the largest gaps are Switzerland, the
US, Britain and Russia, while countries with relatively small gender gaps include the Eastern
European countries of East Germany and Bulgaria, as well as Sweden, Italy, Ireland and New

24

Zealand.23 Table 2 also shows GAP US CHARS, the gender pay gap evaluated at US values of
male and female human capital characteristics (column 2), and the unexplained gender pay gap
(column 3). The estimated corrected gender gaps are highly correlated across the two methods
and each is also highly correlated with the total gender pay gap, likely due in part to our inability
to control for actual labor market experience which has been found to be a major difference in
qualifications between men and women.24
Table 2 also summarizes international differences in male labor market prices. As
expected, the US is at or near the top in each of the inequality measures. And, while there is a
positive correlation between the price effects of measured X’s (STD DEV (Xus) or 50-10 WAGE
GAP (Xus)) and residual inequality (RESID STD DEV or 50-10 RESID GAP), a look at the
rankings shows that they do appear to measure different things. For example, Australia has the
10th largest measured price variation (STD DEV) out of the 22 countries, but the 4th largest
residual standard deviation; and Russia’s comparison is particularly dramatic—it has the second
smallest measured price variation (STD DEV) but the largest residual standard deviation.25
Finally the table shows net female supply relative to the US in 1989. Ireland, Italy and
the Netherlands have much smaller female net supply than the other countries, a pattern driven
primarily by female labor supply rather than by the demand for women. On the other hand, the
Eastern European countries have the highest net supply of women, again driven primarily by
female labor supply.
23

It is possible to keep East and West Germany separate even after unification in the ISSP data. We follow this
procedure due to sizable differences between the two in the dependent and many of the explanatory variables. The
country rankings here tend to be similar to those based on published data or other studies, when available (Blau and
Kahn 1995; OECD various issues; ILO various issues). The gap for Australia is larger than that reported in OECD
publications. This discrepancy appears to be due to the OECD data restriction to nonsupervisory employees; the
gender gap we obtain from the ISSP data is consistent with studies which use other microdata for Australia (Blau
and Kahn 1995; Gregory and Daly 1991). The extremely small gender gap we estimate for Italy may be in part a
result of its large unreported sector (Erickson and Ichino 1995). Since the wages of many secondary workers are
“off the books,” respondents may be reluctant to report this income.
24
In the regression sample of 100 country-year data points, the correlation between TOTAL GAP and GAP US
CHARS is .8680; between TOTAL GAP and the UNEXPLAINED GAP, .9333; and between GAP US CHARS and
the UNEXPLAINED GAP, .9085.
25
Overall, our two measures of labor market prices are modestly positively correlated. Across the regression
sample, STD DEV (Xus) and RESID STD DEV have a correlation coefficient of .2376, while 50-10 WAGE GAP
(Xus) and 50-10 RESID GAP have a correlation coefficient of .3170.

Before proceeding to the results from estimating equation (10), we present figures
showing the univariate relationship between one of our main dependent variable (GAP US
CHARS), and two measures of wage compression: i) the 50-10 gap in predicted US male log
wages using the country's own male wage equation for each year (50-10 WAGE GAP (XUS)),
shown in Figure 1; and ii) the 50-10 gap in the country's male log wage residuals for that year
(50-10 RESID GAP), shown in Figure 2. All country-year data points are included and each
figure includes an ordinary least squares regression line for ease of interpretation. In each case,
we observe the predicted positive relationship between the gender log wage gap and male
inequality. While the figures provide some suggestive evidence of an impact of institutions on
the gender pay gap, we now turn to an econometric test of this relationship.
Table 3 shows regression results for the basic time-series, cross-section estimation of
equation (10). Across a variety of specifications with three alternative dependent variables and
two alternative measures of labor market prices, the results consistently show that higher
measured prices are associated with a higher gender pay gap.26 The coefficients for the price
variables are between 1.69 and 1.85 times their standard errors in the 50-10 WAGE GAP
specification and statistically significant at better than the 5% level (on a two-tailed test) in the
STD DEV specification for all dependent variables. Residual inequality is also found to be
positively related to the gender gap and the estimated coefficients are always larger than their
standard errors; the coefficients on these variables are statistically significant at better than the
5% level (on a two-tailed test) in the GAP US CHARS specification. Note that these findings for
residual inequality strongly suggest that the male regression residual contains information
regarding international differences in the prices of unmeasured skills, although it may also be
influenced by international differences in the quantities of unmeasured skills as well as
measurement error. Finally, in each specification, higher female net supply has the expected
positive effect on the gender pay gap; its coefficient is always larger than its standard error and is

26

The results were very similar when we omitted the year dummy variables.

26

statistically significant at better than the 5% level (on a two-tailed test) in the GAP US CHARS
and UNEXPLAINED GAP specifications. We also note that, as would be expected, the
estimated effect of variation in measured prices on the gender gap tends to be larger in the GAP
US CHARS specification than in the UEXPLAINED GAP specification, although these
differences are never significant.
Although the three measures of the gender gap are highly correlated, the most
consistently statistically significant results in Table 3 are for the specification with GAP US
CHARS as the dependent variable. In this model, five of the six coefficients are significant at
better than the 5% level, and the sixth is significant at the 8.7% level, all on two-tailed tests. It
may be recalled that GAP US CHARS is our preferred measure since it nets out international
differences in women's relative qualifications, but preserves gender differences in measured
characteristics (at the US levels). The specifications in which male inequality is measured by the
standard deviation tend to perform somewhat better than those using the 50-10 specification.
This is perhaps not surprising in that the standard deviation takes into account inequality at all
portions of the distribution and thus potentially conveys more information. The fact that the 5010 specification performs nearly as well, despite its focus on only the bottom of the distribution,
supports our expectation that it is this portion of the distribution that is particularly relevant for
women.
The effects implied by the estimated coefficients in Table 3 are important in magnitude as
well as generally statistically significant. To see this, it is useful to simulate the impact on the
gender pay gap of going from the 25th to the 75th percentile among country averages ranked
according to the variability of male measured prices, male residual inequality or female net
supply. Using the GAP US CHARS dependent variable and the standard deviation inequality
specification, we find that such an increase in male measured price inequality would lead to a
.055 log point increase in the gender log wage gap, which is 38% of the actual 75-25 difference
in the country average GAP US CHARS of .146 for our sample. A similar increase in male
residual inequality is associated with an increase in the gender pay gap of .032 log points, or
27

22% of the actual 75-25 differential in GAP US CHARS. Finally, a 75-25 increase in female net
supply would lead to a .051 log point increase in the gender pay gap, or 35% of the 75-25
differential in the pay gap. The other specifications in Table 3 usually imply effects similar in
magnitude to these. These findings suggest a strong role for both labor market prices and female
net supply in affecting the gender pay gap, with a quantitatively larger effect for measured prices
and residuals together than for net supply.
A further indication of the quantitative importance of these variables is provided by the
results presented in Table 4. The table shows, for selected Western countries, the percentage of
the difference between the Western country average of GAP US CHARS and the individual
country's GAP US CHARS which is accounted for by each explanatory variable.27 Looking first
at the findings for the US, we see that the variables included in the regression are more than
sufficient to account for the higher gender pay gap in the US compared to the other Western
countries. This is primarily due to the impact of the wage inequality variables although the
higher net supply of women in the US also plays a role. The fact that the actual difference
between the US and the other Western countries is less than would be expected based on the
levels of the wage inequality and net supply variables implies that there are unmeasured factors
favoring US women compared to women elsewhere. These may relate to women's unmeasured
characteristics relative to men's and/or to laws or policies benefiting women in the US compared
to their counterparts abroad. This conclusion strongly matches the results obtained in our
previous work (Blau and Kahn 1992; 1995; 1996b), despite the very different methodology
employed here.
The table also shows results for Sweden and Japan, two countries that are notable for
their position at the extremes of the international distribution of gender gaps. The relatively low
gender gap in Sweden is well explained by the male wage inequality and net supply variables.

27

We focus on the Western country average as the comparison under the assumption that it would be comprised of
the most comparable countries. However, the results are similar when we consider the full range of countries
included in the regression analysis.

28

Specifically, the extremely low level of male wage inequality in Sweden would be more than
sufficient to account for the lower gender pay gap there, however its effect is offset somewhat by
the relatively high net supply of women workers. Overall, the variables included in the
regression are estimated to explain 63-67 percent of the lower gender gap in Sweden than in
other Western countries. That the regression variables can explain less than the full amount of
the lower gender gap in Sweden suggests that, as in the case of the US, there are unmeasured
factors benefiting Swedish women relative to women elsewhere. Finally, the results for Japan
indicate that the variables included in the regression analysis can explain only a relatively small
proportion of the extremely large gender pay gap there: 11-12 percent. This suggests that the
large gender pay gap in Japan to a considerable extent reflects unmeasured factors that are highly
unfavorable to women.
In subsequent analyses we focus on specifications that employ GAP US CHARS as the
dependent variable. However, before turning to these results, we consider whether the results in
Table 3 suggest there are incentive effects of wage compression that affect women differently
than men. To examine this question we compare the magnitude of the effect of male inequality
when we control for human capital (i.e., in the GAP US CHARS and UNEXPLAINED GAP
specifications) to the effect when we do not (i.e., when TOTAL GAP is the dependent variable).
A larger positive effect in the former case, for example, would suggest that higher prices of
human capital induce a larger investment response for women than for men—although, on net,
lower inequality is associated with a smaller gender pay gap. The results are not particularly
consistent with such incentive effects. No consistent pattern emerges when we look at the
impact of measured prices, and the differences between the coefficients on the price variables
controlling and not controlling for human capital are not statistically significant. While the
effects of male residual inequality are consistently larger when we control for human capital, the
differences are generally not statistically significant. Thus, the possibility that there are negative
incentive effects of wage compression which are stronger for women than for men receives little
empirical support here.
29

We found the results in Table 3 to be robust to the inclusion of the additional controls
discussed above—parental leave entitlement duration and its square, a control for Eastern
European countries (EAST), and the degree of occupational segregation. Further, these
additional controls did not have significant effects on the gender pay gap, and interactions
between EAST and the male inequality and net supply variables also proved to be insignificant
individually and as a group. Moreover, the results were similar when we estimated the gender
pay gap controlling for one digit occupation.
Table A1 shows that our basic findings are not due to the extreme case of the United
States with its high level of wage inequality and relatively large gender pay gap.28 The results
for GAP US CHARS when the US is omitted are very similar to those for the full sample in
Table 3: male inequality and female net supply both continue to have large, usually statistically
significant positive effects on the gender pay gap. And the magnitudes of these effects are
comparable to those reported above. Thus, while we found in earlier work (Blau and Kahn,
1992, 1995 and 1996b) that wage structure was important in explaining the differences between
the gender pay gap in the US and other countries, the results presented here strongly suggest that
this conclusion holds more generally.
Table A2 shows results in which we disaggregate the net supply variable into its
component supply and demand indexes. The results indicate that the positive effects of net
supply on the gender pay gap reported in Tables 3 are driven by female supply. In particular,
female supply has positive effects on the gender pay gap that are large and statistically
significant at better than the 5% level (in two tailed tests) in five of six cases. In contrast, while
the effects of female demand on the gender pay gap are always negative, as expected, they are
smaller than their standard errors in absolute value in each case. However, in each specification,
we accept the hypothesis that the supply and demand coefficients are equal in magnitude and
28

With the US omitted, the average values of the male inequality and gender gap variables over the remaining 21
countries are: TOTAL GAP (.303); GAP US CHARS (.265); UNEXPLAINED GAP (.278); STD DEV (.264);
RESID STD DEV (.445); 50-10 WAGE GAP (.367); and 50-10 RESID GAP (.508). These may be compared to the
figures for the US in Table 2.

30

opposite in sign (and thus that the net supply variable is an appropriate specification). The
poorer showing for the demand variable may reflect our inability to control for within-industry
demand.
Table 5 shows that the basic results hold up for specific subsamples: namely, wage and
salary workers and married workers.29 In all cases, the male inequality variables have positive
effects on the gender pay gap, and these are usually statistically significant. Net supply
continues to have a positive coefficient, although it is significant only once (the 50-10
specification for the All Workers, Married Only sample). In other specifications not shown, we
obtain similar results when we include all workers but control for marital status in estimating the
gender pay gap.30
Other alternative specifications address a potential difficulty concerning the interpretation
of our price variables. Specifically, because of omitted productivity characteristics, one country
may have a seemingly higher return to education than another country, a difference that would be
reflected in our measured price variability term. While we would like to interpret this variable as
a measure of prices, it may instead reflect the variability of unmeasured skills that are correlated
with education. For example, it has been pointed out that low skill workers in the US have lower
relative levels of literacy than low skill workers in other OECD countries (OECD 1998).
To take account of this possibility, we used data from the International Adult Literacy
Survey 1994-6, as tabulated in OECD (1998), to form a rough control for average national levels
of these unmeasured skill differences. In particular, for a subset of 11 of our 22 countries for
which data were available, we computed the average difference in literacy test scores between
those with upper secondary education only (i.e. middle levels) and those with less than upper
secondary levels of education (lower levels).31 This is an estimate of average differences in
29

The former includes all wage and salary workers, regardless of marital status, while the latter includes all married
workers, regardless of their self employment/wage and salary worker status.
30
Recall that the measures of male inequality in all specifications include controls for marital status even when the
measure of the gender pay gap does not include this control.
31
The countries were Australia, Canada, Germany, Ireland, Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Sweden,
Switzerland, the UK and the US. Since Switzerland's scores were broken down into French and German regions, we

31

unmeasured skills between workers with middle and low levels of education for each country.
When we added this literacy variable to our basic models, the effects of prices and net supply
were unaffected, and they were qualitatively similar to those for the full sample of 22 countries
without the literacy variable included. Further, the literacy variable did not affect the gender pay
gap. This alternative specification increases our confidence that our measured price variables
really do reflect prices and that compressed returns to skills in general lead to a smaller gender
pay gap.
We now present results that attempt to determine the degree to which our findings are
due to differences across countries vs. changes over time within countries. Table 6 presents our
basic model with country dummies added. In this case, the variation in the dependent and
explanatory variables is entirely due to within country variation, while the results without
country dummies (Table 3) combine the effects of within-country and between-country variation.
In both the 50-10 and standard deviation specifications, the estimated effect of male measured
prices on the gender pay gap remains positive but is no longer significant. Male residual
inequality is now estimated to have a negative effect on the gender pay gap, but the estimated
coefficients are considerably smaller than their standard errors. The effect of net supply remains
positive but insignificant. Thus, the within estimates obtained by controlling for country
dummies are considerably weaker and, in the case of male residual inequality, conflict with those
not controlling for country dummies. This implies that the basic time-series cross-section results
are primarily due to differences between countries rather than to changes over time within
countries.32
The divergence of the fixed effects results from the estimates without controlling for
country effects likely reflects the different sources of variation in male inequality in each of the
two cases discussed above. An additional factor working against obtaining equally strong results

averaged them, although they were very similar to each other. The literacy variable is available only at one point in
time, 1994-6.
32
When we used country averages, we obtain similar results to those in Table 3, further underscoring the
conclusion that our time series, cross section results are driven primarily by between country effects.

32

in the time series as in the cross-section is that most of the variation in the explanatory variables
is between rather than within countries (Hamermesh, 2000).33 Indeed, this is perhaps not
surprising in that one of the attractions of international comparisons is the considerable variation
in both the dependent and explanatory variables that such data provide, far exceeding what
would be available for any individual country.
In light of the within country results in Table 6, the time series, cross-section results can
be interpreted as primarily reflecting long-run differences across countries. One interpretation of
the findings for male prices is that wage-setting institutions such as collective bargaining
contracts that call for high wage floors lower male inequality and the gender pay gap as well.
Further, where women are scarce in relation to the demand for labor in industries that
traditionally employ them, the gender pay gap will be lower. This finding could reflect basic
supply and demand in the labor market or selectivity of the female labor force. But these
interpretations can only be made subject to the usual caveat concerning cross-sectional
differences across countries: there may be factors we cannot control for that influence male
labor market prices and female net supply as well as the gender pay gap. The reduced form
results presented in Tables 7-9 shed additional light on this issue and also respond to the concern
that wage inequality and possibly female net supply are potentially endogenous.
Specifically, in Tables 7-9, we present a number of reduced form specifications for the
determination of the gender pay gap, omitting our measures of male wage inequality and instead
including information on institutions that are expected to affect wage inequality in general or the
gender gap specifically. These institutions include collective bargaining coverage, minimum
wage laws, unemployment insurance systems, and job protection, as well as parental leave
entitlements. The Data Appendix contains details on how these variables were constructed. As
much as possible, we have constructed time varying measures of these institutions, to reflect the
ongoing reforms of labor market institutions in the OECD (Boeri 2000). This analysis was based
33

Seventy-five percent or more of the variation in the male inequality variables and 95 percent of the variation in net
supply is associated with between country variation.

33

in most cases on the 14 countries for which we had this information.34 There has been some
relaxation of employment protection restrictions and some reduction in collective bargaining
coverage in several countries over the 1980s and 1990s, and this is reflected in our institutional
measures. However, as was the case with our wage compression and net supply measures, the
cross country variation in these institutions is much greater than their variation over time within
countries. Specifically, between 89 and 99.96 percent of the total variation in collective
bargaining coverage, unemployment insurance rules, parental leave entitlements, and job
protection in our sample occurs between countries. Therefore, while there is time variation in
these measures of labor market institutions, we are essentially looking at the effects of crosssectional differences in them.
Table 7 shows results for including collective bargaining coverage alone (with year
dummies) and with our original measures of wage compression and female net supply. With no
covariates besides year dummies, collective bargaining coverage has a coefficient of -.0029 that
is highly significant. This coefficient corresponds to a large impact of collective bargaining on
the gender pay gap, implying that an increase in collective bargaining coverage from the 25th to
the 75th percentile in our sample of 14 countries (i.e., going from 47 to 82 percent coverage)
decreases the gender pay gap by .10 log points. This predicted fall is larger than the actual 75-25
difference in the gender pay gap among these countries of .07 log points. The second and third
specifications in Table 7 reproduce the corresponding ones in Table 3 for the sample of countries
for which information on collective bargaining is available. As may be seen in the table, we
obtain similar results to those in Table 3 for this subsample: measured male price inequality,
male residual wage inequality, and female net supply all have positive, significant effects on the
gender pay gap.
The final two specifications in Table 7 show that there is still a direct effect of collective
bargaining even when wage compression and female net supply are included in the regression.
34

The countries were Austria, Australia, Britain, Canada, West Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands,
New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the US.

34

In these instances, the collective bargaining coefficient is -.0024 to -.0028 and is 2-2.2 times its
standard error in absolute value. A possible reason for this finding is that countries with very
high levels of collective bargaining coverage have a greater coverage of female-dominated
sectors of the labor market than countries with lower overall levels of collective bargaining. A
further possibility is that the estimated direct effect of collective bargaining may be due in part to
the fact that the extent of wage inequality is not perfectly captured by our inequality variables.
Our estimate of the impact of measured prices in based on just a few variables reflecting
education, potential experience and marital status, and our measure of residual inequality reflects
not only unmeasured prices but also differences across countries in the variation in unmeasured
quantities and measurement error. Thus the extent of collective bargaining may continue to
reflect the impact of wage compression, even when our inequality variables are included. When
we control for collective bargaining, measured inequality in male prices and female net supply
are still positively associated with the gender pay gap with effects that are 1.6-2.0 (measured
price inequality) or 1.4-1.9 (female net supply) times their standard errors. However, in contrast
to the results in Table 3, there is no longer a positive association between male residual wage
inequality and the gender pay gap; this effect is negative and insignificant in Table 7.
Table 8 provides further evidence on the importance of institutions in affecting the
gender pay gap by looking at both minimum wages and collective bargaining. The first column
shows the impact of the minimum wage level (relative to the average wage) when only year
dummies included. The coefficient is significantly negative, suggesting a negative correlation
between the “bite” of minimum wages and the gender pay gap.35 However, when we control for
collective bargaining coverage and minimum wages at the same time, the effect of minimum
wages becomes much smaller and is now insignificant. The effect of collective bargaining,
however, remains significantly negative and large in absolute value even controlling for
minimum wages. We further note that in several countries where there is a national wage floor,
35

The sample in Table 8 includes one less observation than that in Table 7 because we lack data on minimum
wages in Switzerland.

35

this is set in collective bargaining agreements covering most of the labor force (in our sample,
this includes Austria, Norway and Sweden) or in the application of collective bargaining
agreements to nonunion workers (for example, Germany, Italy and Australia). In other
countries, however, the government actually passes minimum wage legislation (e.g.,
Netherlands, UK, Japan, New Zealand, Canada, US, and Ireland).36 However, even where there
is a statutory minimum, its level may be influenced by the strength of unions in influencing the
political process. It may therefore be difficult to disentangle the impact of legislated minima
from the effect of collective bargaining.
Bearing these difficulties in mind, the last two specifications shown in Table 8 attempt to
more finely distinguish between the effects of collective bargaining and minimum wage
legislation on the gender pay gap. In the first of these, we add a dummy variable for the
existence of a statutory minimum. While this dummy is not significant, and the minimum wage
variable remains insignificant, in both cases the effect is negative and 1.4-1.5 times its standard
error in absolute value. Note that the impact of collective bargaining coverage remains highly
significant and large in absolute value. The last model adds an interaction term between having
a statutory minimum and the minimum wage (relative to the average). In this case, the main
effect for the minimum/average becomes statistically significant, although an F-test shows that
the effect of the minimum/average for countries with statutory minima (i.e., the sum of the
minimum/average main effect and its interaction with the statutory minimum dummy) is not
significant. The impact of collective bargaining, as always, remains significantly negative and
large in absolute value. This model suggests that a national wage floor has a significantly
negative effect on the gender pay gap if it comes about through collective bargaining, but not if it
comes about through legislation. However, this result may be misleading. During our sample
period, in both the UK and Ireland, the statutory minima applied only to certain industries and
covered a very small portion of the labor force, suggesting that, in effect, these countries did not
36

See Nickell and Layard (1999) and Neumark and Wascher (1999) for further discussion of minimum wage
systems.

36

have a national minimum wage (Nickell and Layard 1999). When we re-estimated the model
giving these countries a zero for the minimum/average and the statutory minimum dummy
variables, the minimum/average variable now had insignificant effects on the gender pay gap for
all countries. The impact of collective bargaining coverage, however, remained negative,
significant and large in absolute value. Overall, then, it appears that collective bargaining
coverage has a stronger effect on the gender pay gap than minimum wage laws do. This
conclusion makes sense if collective bargaining has larger wage effects at the bottom than
statutory minimum wage laws.37
Table 9 shows results for collective bargaining, controlling for the effect of parental
leave, unemployment insurance and job protection policies and, in one specification,
occupational segregation and female net supply as well. In all cases, collective bargaining
continues to have a negative, significant effect on the gender pay gap that is large in absolute
value. Evidence on the effects of the other policies was sensitive to the inclusion of the
occupational segregation and female net supply variables. When these variables are not included
(i.e., in the first and second specifications shown in the table), the labor market policies variables
have insignificant effects both individually and as a group. However, controlling for net supply
and segregation, these policy variables are significant at the 8% level as a group, although not
individually.38 Finally, the segregation index has the expected positive effect on the gender pay
gap, although it is only 1.53 times its standard error.
These reduced form results for collective bargaining further strengthen our confidence in
our basic findings for male wage inequality. Nonetheless it is always possible that there are
omitted variables that are correlated with collective bargaining coverage and the gender pay

37

Additionally, there was no evidence that the effect of collective bargaining coverage was significantly affected by
the relative level of minimum wages.
38
This difference in the impact of the policy variables depending on whether we control for net supply and
segregation is not due to the smaller sample (66 observations) for which segregation data are available. When we
re-estimated the second specification shown in Table 9 on this subsample, the policy variables remained jointly and
individually insignificant.

37

gap.39 For example, there are other social programs that differ in generosity across countries
which could potentially affect both male inequality and the gender gap. For example, we do not
have good data on the enforcement of equal employment opportunity laws, and variation in this
factor may help explain differences in the gender pay gap. One possible indicator for such
enforcement is the incidence of employment in very small firms, many of which are effectively
exempt from labor market regulation (Carrington, McCue and Pierce 2000). We examined this
issue for the nine countries for which the OECD (1994) collected information during the 1990-2
period on the fraction of employment in firms with less than 20 workers.40 While the sample
size fell to 47 in this analysis, we still found a negative, significant effect of collective bargaining
on the gender pay gap, while the effect of the incidence of employment in small firms was small
and insignificant. Although the incidence of employment by firm size can clearly be affected by
relative wages and by labor market institutions, the impact of collective bargaining was
nonetheless robust with respect to this possible measure of the degree to which equal
employment opportunity laws are enforced.
The results discussed above indicate that our findings for collective bargaining coverage
are strong whether or not controls for other institutions are included. Further, according to
Summers, Gruber and Vergara (1993), it is centralizing wage-setting institutions that are
primarily responsible for the growth of generous social programs in countries like Sweden. If
this is the case, then our models can be viewed as reduced forms of such a process in which the
prime mover is collective bargaining.

39

While we have used the degree of collective bargaining coverage, it is also possible that the degree of
coordination of collective bargaining can have an independent effect on wage inequality and thus on the gender pay
gap. We investigated the impact of coordination using Nickell's (1997) 6 point scale, which improves upon
Calmfors and Driffill’s (1988) original centralization measure by taking into account pattern bargaining and
coordination. Unfortunately, in the sample of 14 countries for which we had data, collective bargaining coverage
and coordination were too closely correlated to reliably disentangle their separate effects; the two variables had a
correlation coefficient of .67. Collective bargaining coverage and Calmfors and Driffill’s (1988) original
centralization measure were correlated at 0.71 with country rankings for collective bargaining coverage (OECD
1997, p. 73).
40
The countries were Australia, Canada, Germany, Italy, Japan, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK and the United
States.

38

Another potential omitted variable would be social norms. For example, it is possible
that a high degree of collective bargaining coverage, low male inequality, and a small gender gap
all reflect an underlying social egalitarianism. While this is plausible, it seems unlikely to
provide a full explanation for our findings. For one thing, there is considerable evidence that
discontinuous changes in wage setting institutions within countries do produce changes in wage
inequality (Blau and Kahn 1999). For another, there are the examples of countries like Austria
and Italy that have highly centralized wage setting and relatively low male inequality and gender
differentials and yet show little evidence of favorable treatment of women as a group otherwise.
A final consideration relates to a possible alternative interpretation of our finding of a
negative association between wage compression and the gender pay gap, at least some of which
appears to be due to the impact of collective bargaining coverage. We believe that these results
indicate that bringing up the bottom of the pay distribution raises the relative wages of low-paid
workers such as women. However, it is also possible that the negative relationship between pay
compression and the gender pay gap reflects a positive impact of high wage floors on women's
labor market skills, particularly their levels of actual labor market experience, although it may be
recalled that the sign of this relationship is theoretically ambiguous. Some indication of the
importance of this effect can be gained from panel data sets available for the US, Sweden and
Germany which, unlike the ISSP, do have information on actual experience.
Germany and Sweden are both highly unionized societies with 80-90% collective
bargaining coverage, in contrast to the US, with its 18% coverage rate in 1990. And Table 2
shows that the male wage distribution is indeed much more compressed in these countries than in
the US. Using data sets we employed in earlier work (Blau and Kahn 1996b and 2000), we find
that the male-female gap in actual experience in 1984 was about 6 years in the US and 5 years in
Sweden and Germany. While these figures are consistent with the idea that high wage floors
encourage female labor force commitment, in fact female relative labor force participation rates
among these three countries in the 1980s were highest in Sweden but higher in the US than in

39

West Germany.41 And the male-female experience gap in the US declined steadily over the
1980s (Blau and Kahn 1997). Further, US women are much more likely to work full-time than
women in these other countries (Blau and Kahn 1995). Thus, by the end of the 1980s, it is
possible that US women had higher relative experience levels than women in several more
highly unionized countries. It is therefore unlikely that a union effect on women's unmeasured
labor market qualifications is responsible for our basic findings. Even if it were, however, one
could still attribute an ultimate causal role to institutions of wage compression.

VI. Conclusions
This paper tested the hypotheses that overall wage compression and low female supply
relative to demand reduce a country’s gender pay gap. Using micro-data for 22 countries over
the 1985-94 period, we found that more compressed male wage structures and lower female net
supply are both associated with a lower gender pay gap. Since it is likely that labor market
institutions are responsible for an important portion of international differences in wage
inequality, the inverse relationship between the gender pay gap and male wage inequality
suggests that wage-setting mechanisms, such as encompassing collective bargaining agreements,
that provide for relatively high wage floors raise the relative pay of women, who tend to be at the
bottom of the wage distribution. Consistent with this view, we find that the extent of collective
bargaining coverage in each country is significantly negatively related to the gender gap.
Overall, our results provide strong evidence that wage setting institutions have important effects
on the gender pay gap, and some evidence of the impact of the market forces of supply and
demand as well.
41

Specifically, over the 1985-88 period, the ratio of the female to the male labor force participation rate was 58.6%
in West Germany, 73.3% in the US, and 94.5% in Sweden (Blau and Ferber 1992). The experience gap accounted
for only about .03 log points of the 1984 .21 log point difference in the Swedish-US gender gaps (Blau and Kahn
1996b).

Data Appendix
In this appendix, we briefly describe the sources for the construction of the institutional
variables used in Tables 7-9:
Collective bargaining coverage was taken from OECD (1997), which had data for 1980,
1990 and 1994. We used linear interpolation to create a time series for this variable. For several
countries, 1980 information was not available. In these cases, we used the 1990 figures. For
Ireland, we assigned a value of 75 for collective bargaining coverage, in light of Layard, Nickell
and Jackman’s (1991) classification of this country as having coverage in the “70 percent and
above” range.
Parental leave was constructed from Ruhm and Teague (1997), who reported 1981 and
1991 values for parental leave and Nickell and Layard (1999), who reported 1995 values for this
variable. Again, we used linear interpolation to create a time series.
Regular and temporary employment protection were taken from OECD (1999), which
reported indexes for protection for the late 1980s and the late 1990s. We used the late 1980s
values for the years 1985-1989, and the late 1990s values for the years 1990-94. Results were
similar when we used a simple average of the late 1980s and the late 1990s for the 1990-94
period. The scales for these variables ranged from 0 to 4, with a higher value signifying more
government restrictions on firms’ use of labor.
Unemployment insurance (UI) benefit duration was taken from Nickell and Layard
(1999) and is a one-time average for 1989-94. The average and maximum UI replacement rates
were taken from Blanchard and Wolfers (2000). These authors compute 1985-89 and 1990-94
averages for these variables. We use the former for 1985-89 and the latter for 1990-94, thus
creating a time-varying variable for UI replacement rates.
Minimum wages/average wages are a one-time average taken from Nickell and Layard
(1999) and refer to 1991-4.
The Segregation Index comes from Anker (1998), Table 9.1. It is based on 75
nonagricultural two-digit occupations. Data refer to: 1990 for Australia, Austria, Canada, the

Hungary, Japan, Netherlands, Norway and the UK; 1991 for Sweden and the US; 1989 for W.
Germany; 1986 for New Zealand; 1980 for Switzerland; 1985 for Bulgaria; 1988 for Poland;
1981 for Italy and Slovenia (former Yugoslavia).

Notes: Gender gap computed from equations including education, potential experience and its square. Male prices and residuals are from
equations that additionally include marital status. Standard errors are heteroskedasticity-robust and are corrected for within-country
error correlation. TOTAL GAP is the gender log difference in hours-corrected earnings; GAP US CHARS is the gender pay gap assuming US
male and female values for the X variables; UNEXPLAINED GAP is the difference in a country's predicted pay for women based on the country's
male and its female wage coefficients, evaluated at female means.
