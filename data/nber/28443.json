    "abstract": "\n\nWe experimentally evaluate the impact on child malnutrition of a maternal cash transfer program in Myanmar that was supplemented with Social Behavior Change Communication (SBCC) in a subset of villages. The combination of interventions significantly reduced the proportion of children stunted, while cash alone had no impact on stunting. SBCC appears to have worked in conjunction with cash to reduce stunting by encouraging mothers to increase children\u2019s total calories and protein consumed. The findings provide evidence that information constraints contribute to low income-elasticity of calorie demand among malnourished populations, and underscore the importance of adding SBCC to cash transfer programs.\n\n",
