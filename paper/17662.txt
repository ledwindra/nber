Fiscal Devaluations

ABSTRACT
We show that even when the exchange rate cannot be devalued, a small set of conventional fiscal instruments
can robustly replicate the real allocations attained under a nominal exchange rate devaluation in a dynamic
New Keynesian open economy environment. We perform the analysis under alternative pricing assumptions–
producer or local currency pricing, along with nominal wage stickiness; under arbitrary degrees of
asset market completeness and for general stochastic sequences of devaluations. There are two types
of fiscal policies equivalent to an exchange rate devaluation–one, a uniform increase in import tariff
and export subsidy, and two, a value-added tax increase and a uniform payroll tax reduction. When
the devaluations are anticipated, these policies need to be supplemented with a consumption tax reduction
and an income tax increase. These policies are revenue neutral. In certain cases equivalence requires,
in addition, a partial default on foreign bond holders. We discuss the issues of implementation of these
policies, in particular, under the circumstances of a currency union.

Introduction

Exchange rate devaluations have long been proposed as a desirable policy response to macroeconomic shocks that impair a country’s competitiveness in the presence of price and wage
rigidities. Milton Friedman famously argued for flexible exchange rates on these grounds.
Yet countries that wish to or have to maintain a fixed exchange rate cannot resort to exchange rate devaluations. In this paper we show how a country can use unilateral fiscal policy
to generate the same real outcomes as those following a nominal exchange rate devaluation,
while keeping the nominal exchange rate fixed.
This question about fiscal devaluations dates back to the period of the gold standard when
countries could not devalue their currencies. At that time, Keynes (1931) had proposed that
a uniform ad valorem tariff on all imports plus a uniform subsidy on all exports would have
the same impact as an exchange rate devaluation. Recently, it has also been conjectured
that a similar outcome could be achieved by increasing value-added taxes and cutting payroll
taxes (e.g., social security contributions).
The current crisis in the Euro area has brought fiscal devaluations to the forefront of
policy. The Euro has been blamed for the inability of countries like Greece, Portugal, Spain,
Italy and even France to devalue their exchange rates and restore their competitiveness in
international markets.1 Faced with the dramatic alternatives of austerity-ridden internal
devaluation and exit from the Euro, countries in the Eurozone are considering the option
of fiscal devaluations. Indeed, in 2012, France has implemented a fiscal devaluation. Previous examples include Denmark in 1988, Sweden in 1993, and Germany in 2006. Fiscal
devaluations have clearly become a serious policy option.
Despite discussions in policy circles, there is little formal analysis of fiscal devaluations.2
This is an area where the policy debate is ahead of academic knowledge. This paper is
intended to bridge this gap, by providing the first formal analysis of fiscal devaluations in
a stochastic dynamic general equilibrium New Keynesian open economy environment.3 In

We adopt the New Keynesian framework with nominal rigidities as it provides the most natural laboratory for studying the real consequences of a nominal devaluation, however, our equivalence results between
nominal and fiscal devaluations generalize beyond the models with nominal frictions.

1

doing so, we learn under what circumstances the tariff-cum-subsidy and VAT-cum-payroll
fiscal interventions suffice to attain equivalence and when they need to be supplemented with
additional policy adjustments.
We define a fiscal devaluation of size δt at date t to be a set of unilateral fiscal polices that
implements the same real allocation as under a nominal exchange rate devaluation of size δt ,
but holding the nominal exchange rate fixed. We explore a general path of δt , including both
expected and unexpected devaluations. Since the nature of price rigidity—whether prices
are set in the currency of the producers or in local currency—is central for the real effects of
nominal devaluations (see, for example, Lane, 2001; Corsetti, 2008), we allow for both the
cases of producer (PCP) and local currency pricing (LCP) and for nominal wage rigidity.4
Additionally, we allow for a wide range of alternative international asset market structures,
including complete markets, and various degrees of incompleteness such as international
trade in risk-free nominal bonds only or international trade in equities.
We find that, first, despite the fact that the actual allocations induced by devaluations in
New Keynesian environments are sensitive to the details of the environment, there exists a
small set of fiscal instruments that can robustly replicate the effects—both on real variables
and nominal prices—of nominal exchange rate devaluations across all specifications. The
exact details of which instruments need to be used depend on the extent of completeness of
asset markets, the currency denomination of bonds and the expected or unexpected nature
of devaluations. Second, the required adjustment in taxes is only a function of δt , the
size of the required devaluation, and is independent of all details of the environment, such
as for example the degree of wage and price stickiness, and the type of pricing (local or
producer currency). Third, when all proposed tax instruments are used a fiscal devaluation
is government revenue neutral. Otherwise, we show that these policies generate additional
government revenue in periods of trade deficits.
We study both types of fiscal devaluations—a uniform increase in import tariffs and
export subsidies and a uniform increase in value-added taxes and reduction in payroll taxes.
The dynamic analysis reveals that both of these policies, in general, need to be accompanied
by a uniform reduction in consumption taxes and an increase in income taxes.5 However,
under some circumstances, changes in consumption and income taxes can be dispensed
with. Whether this latter option is possible depends on the extent of completeness of asset
4

PCP refers to the case when prices are sticky in the currency of the producer (exporter), while LCP is
the case when prices are sticky in the currency of the consumer (importer) of the good.
5
A consumption tax is equivalent to a sales tax that is applied only to final goods, and not to intermediate
goods. In our setup all goods are final, and hence consumption and sales taxes are always equivalent. Further,
under the tariff-based policy, an increase in income tax should extend to both wage income and dividend
income, while under the VAT-based policy, the dividend-income tax should be left unchanged.

markets and whether the exchange rate movements that are being mimicked are anticipated
or unanticipated.
To provide intuition for the underlying mechanisms, consider the case of producer currency pricing (PCP). One of the channels through which a nominal devaluation raises relative
output at home is through a depreciation of home’s terms of trade that makes home goods
cheaper relative to foreign goods. This movement in the terms of trade can be mimicked
either through a combination of import tariff and export subsidy or through an increase in
the value-added tax (which is reimbursed to exporters and levied on importers). Additionally, to ensure that prices at home are the same as under a nominal devaluation, an increase
in the value-added tax needs to be offset with a reduction in the payroll tax. The relative
prices of all goods then respond identically under a fiscal and nominal devaluation.
When is a reduction in consumption taxes and an increase in income taxes required?
Without a reduction in consumption taxes, fiscal devaluations result in an appreciated real
exchange rate relative to a nominal devaluation. This is because fiscal devaluations, despite
having the same effect on the terms of trade, lead to an increase in the relative price of the
home consumption bundle—an effect absent under nominal devaluation. This difference is
of no consequence for the real allocation when trade is balanced or when the devaluation is
unexpected and asset markets are incomplete, as neither risk-sharing nor saving decisions
are affected under these circumstances. As a result, precisely in these two cases, we can
dispense with the adjustment in consumption taxes.
By contrast, with expected devaluations, in the absence of an adjustment in consumption
taxes, the different behavior of the real exchange rate under nominal and fiscal devaluations
induces different savings and portfolio decisions. These effects then need to be undone with a
reduction in consumption taxes. This allows to fully mimic the behavior of the real exchange
rate under a nominal devaluation. When the consumption tax is used, an offsetting increase
in income taxes is required so as not to distort the labor supply decision of households.
In the case of incomplete markets we highlight the role of the currency denomination of
debt. When bonds are denominated in the foreign currency or in the case of equities, no
additional instruments are required for a fiscal devaluation. By contrast when international
bonds are denominated in the home currency, the proposed set of tax instruments does not
suffice. Equivalence then requires a partial default by the home country. Specifically, a
nominal devaluation depletes the foreign-currency value of home’s external debt if it was
denominated in home currency. The proposed limited set of fiscal instruments cannot replicate this effect on home’s foreign obligations. This is why a fiscal devaluation under these
circumstances must be accompanied by a partial default on home-currency debt of the home
3

country.
Importantly, when all four taxes (e.g., VAT, payroll, consumption and income taxes)
are used, the policy is revenue-neutral for the government. That is the direct effects of tax
changes on the fiscal deficit add up to zero as the revenue earned from the VAT and income
tax increases exactly offset the revenue declines that follow the payroll and consumption tax
cuts. The indirect effects on revenue that arise from the stimulative effects of a fiscal devaluation on output, however, remain exactly as in the case of an exchange rate devaluation.
When only a reduced set of tax instruments is used, such as VAT and payroll tax only, a
fiscal devaluation generates positive fiscal revenues in states when the country runs a trade
deficit.
We consider a series of extensions that are important for implementation. We first
examine the implementation of fiscal devaluations by individual countries in a currency
union in a multi-country environment. We show that equivalence is retained for effects on
countries both within and outside the union across nominal and fiscal devaluations. We also
show that when the devaluing country is small relative to the overall size of the currency
union and/or where seigniorage income constitutes a negligible share of a country’s GDP, a
country within a currency union can engineer a fiscal devaluation unilaterally without any
coordination with the union central bank.
We then discuss fiscal devaluations in an economy with capital. When production capital
is a variable input the VAT-based fiscal devaluation requires a reduction in capital taxes to
firms. Without it firms would have an incentive to substitute labor for capital, an effect
absent under a nominal devaluation.
We also investigate the consequence of non-symmetric short-run pass-through of VAT
and payroll taxes into prices. Under these circumstances a fiscal devaluation requires a nonuniform adjustment in the taxes. Specifically, if the short-run pass-through of VAT is larger
than that of a payroll tax, then a one-time devaluation can be replicated with the same
increase in VAT as in the benchmark model, but with a larger reduction in the payroll tax,
with the difference gradually phased out as prices adjust over time.
Finally, we provide a numerical illustration of fiscal devaluations and compare across
various cases of complete and incomplete fiscal devaluations. We calibrate the example
to the recent experience of Spain. We allow for capital and adjustment costs in capital
accumulation and realistic taxes in an environment with wage rigidity. The 2008 crisis
is modeled as the outcome of a borrowing cost shock that generates a decline in output,
consumption and investment similar to those observed in Spain. We show that a nominal
devaluation of 10% eliminates the output decline and essentially replicates the flexible wage
4

allocation. We then compare welfare changes across various cases of complete and incomplete
fiscal devaluation. Specifically, we consider the case when only a VAT-payroll tax swap is
used with no change in capital taxes, the case of an anticipated fiscal devaluation, the case
of smaller fiscal devaluation, and the case when seignorage revenues are set to zero. We show
that the welfare gains from even an incomplete fiscal devaluation are significant.
The outline of the paper is as follows. Section 2 outlines the model. Section 3 presents the
main equivalence results. Section 4 analyzes several extensions, such as implementation in
the currency union, capital inputs, and asymmetric pass-through of taxes. Section 5 provides
a numerical illustration of the equilibrium dynamics under nominal and fiscal devaluations
against that under fixed exchange rates and passive fiscal policy. Section 6 concludes.
Related literature Our paper contributes to a long literature, both positive and normative, that analyzes how to replicate the effects of exchange rate devaluations with fiscal
instruments. The tariff-cum-export subsidy and the VAT increase-cum-payroll tax reduction
are intuitive fiscal policies to replicate the effects of a nominal devaluations on international
relative prices, and accordingly have been discussed before in the policy and academic literature. Poterba, Rotemberg, and Summers (1986) emphasize the fact that tax changes that
would otherwise be neutral if prices and wages were flexible have short-run macroeconomic
effects when prices or wages are sticky. Most recently, Staiger and Sykes (2010) explore
the equivalence using import tariffs and export subsidies in a partial equilibrium static environment with sticky or flexible prices, and under balanced trade. While the equivalence
between a uniform tariff-cum-subsidy and a devaluation has a long tradition in the literature
(as surveyed in Staiger and Sykes, 2010), most of the earlier analysis was conducted in static
endowment economies (or with fixed labor supply). Berglas (1974) provides an equivalence
argument for nominal devaluations, using VAT and tariff-based policies, in a reduced-form
model without micro-foundations, no labor supply and without specifying the nature of asset
markets.6
Our departure from this literature is to perform a dynamic general equilibrium analysis
with varying degrees of price rigidity, alternative asset market assumptions and for expected
and unexpected devaluations. In contrast to the earlier literature, we allow for dynamic price
setting as in the New Keynesian literature, endogenous labor supply, savings and portfolio
choice decisions, as well as interest-elastic money demand. In doing so, we learn that the
tariff-cum-subsidy and VAT-cum-payroll fiscal interventions do not generally suffice to attain
6
The VAT policy with border adjustment has been the focus of Grossman (1980) and Feldstein and
Krugman (1990), however, in an environment with flexible exchange rates and prices. Calmfors (1998)
provides a policy discussion of the potential role of VAT and payroll taxes in impacting allocations in a
currency union.

equivalence. In addition we find that only a small number of additional instruments are
required to robustly implement fiscal devaluation under the fairly rich set of specifications
we explore.
This paper is complementary to Adao, Correia, and Teles (2009) who show that the
allocation in the flexible price, flexible exchange rate economy can be implemented with
fiscal and monetary policies that induce stable producer prices and constant exchange rates.7
This general implementation principle however does not help answer the question of whether
there is a robust and small set of conventional fiscal instruments that can replicate the effect
of a nominal devaluation which is the focus of our paper.
We perform the analysis in a more general environment, with different types of price
and wage stickiness, under a rich array of asset market structures and for expected and
unanticipated devaluations. Importantly, in Adao, Correia, and Teles (2009) since optimal
policy is sensitive to the details of the environment the fiscal instruments used will vary
across environments and in general will require flexibly time-varying and firm-varying taxes,
in contrast to the main result in our paper. In addition, their implementation requires taxes
both at Home and in Foreign. By contrast, ours requires only adjusting taxes at Home.
This is an important advantage because it can be implemented unilaterally. Moreover, their
implementation relies on income taxes and differential consumption taxes for local versus
imported goods. These taxes are less conventional than payroll and value-added taxes—tax
instruments that have been proposed as potential candidates in policy circles (e.g., see IMF,
2011).
The paper is also related to Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2011), who show that in their
environment with downward wage rigidity and inelastic labor supply, the effects of a nominal
devaluation can be replicated with a payroll subside alone. Our paper complements their
analysis by considering a more general environment and showing that in general, a payroll
subsidy alone does not suffice to replicate the effects of a nominal devaluation.
This paper is also related to Lipińska and von Thadden (2009) and Franco (2011) who
quantitatively evaluate the effects of a tax swap from direct (payroll) taxes to indirect taxes
(VAT) under a fixed exchange rate.8 Neither of these studies however explores exact equivalence with a nominal devaluation, as we do in this paper. Lastly, this paper is similar in spirit
to Correia, Farhi, Nicolini, and Teles (2011) who, building on the general implementation
results of Correia, Nicolini, and Teles (2008), use fiscal instruments to replicate the effects of
the optimal monetary policy when the zero-lower bound on nominal interest rate is binding.

Model

The model economy features two countries, home H and foreign F . There are three types
of agents in each economy: consumers, producers and the government, and we describe each
in turn. We then discuss which assumptions of our setup can be further relaxed.

2.1

Consumers

The home country is populated with a continuum of symmetric households. Households are
indexed by h ∈ [0, 1], but we often omit the index h to simplify exposition. In each period,
j
each household h chooses consumption Ct , money Mt and holdings of assets {Bt+1
}j∈Jt ,

where Jt is the set of assets Jt available to the households. Each household also sets a wage
rate Wt (h) and supplies labor Nt (h) in order to satisfy demand at this wage rate.
P

The household h maximizes expected lifetime utility, E0 ∞

where Pt is the consumer price index before consumption subsidy ςtc and mt = Mt (1 + ςtc )/Pt
denotes real money balances. Πt is aggregate profits of the home firms assumed (without loss
of generality) to be held by the representative domestic consumer; τtn is the labor-income tax,
τtd is the profit (dividend-income) tax, and Tt is the lump-sum transfer from the government.
An asset j is characterized by its price Qjt and effective payout Dtj reflecting possible defaults
and haircuts on the asset.
For convenience of exposition we adopt the following standard utility specification:

ζ ≥ 0,
that allows for a home bias, γH = 1 − γF ∈ [1/2, 1]. The consumption of both home and
foreign goods is given by CES aggregators of individual varieties i ∈ [0, 1] with elasticity of
h´
iρ/(ρ−1)
1
substitution ρ > 1: Ckt = 0 Ckt (i)(ρ−1)/ρ di
for k ∈ {H, F }.
We now discuss some of the relevant equilibrium conditions associated with consumers’
optimal decisions. Given the CES structure of consumption aggregators, consumer good
demand is characterized by:

where i is the variety of the home or foreign good (k ∈ {H, F }). Pkt (i), Pkt and Pt are
respectively the price of variety i of good k, the price index for good k and the overall
consumer price index. As is well known, CES price indexes are defined by

and the aggregate consumer expenditure is given by Pt Ct = PHt CHt + PF t CF t with Pkt Ckt =

It is useful to define the nominal stochastic discount factor of a household:

Pt /(1 + ςtc )

(4)

(5)

where the right-hand side is an increasing function of the nominal risk-free interest rate
which satisfies 1 + it+1 = 1/Et Θt+1 .
Foreign households We assume that foreign households face a symmetric problem with
the exception that the foreign government imposes no taxes or subsidies and foreign consumers have a home bias towards foreign-produced goods. We denote foreign variables with
an asterisk. For brevity we omit listing all equilibrium conditions for foreign given the symmetry with home. Define Jt∗ to be the set of assets available to foreign households and
Ωt ⊂ Jt ∩ Jt∗ to be the set of assets traded internationally by both domestic and foreign
households. The equilibrium in the world asset market requires Btj + Bt∗j = 0 for all j ∈ Ωt
since we assume all assets are in zero net supply.
The foreign-currency nominal stochastic discount factor is given by

where Et is the nominal exchange rate, and the foreign currency depreciation rate (Et /Et+1 )
converts the home-currency asset returns into foreign-currency returns. The risk sharing
condition (7) states that domestic and foreign stochastic discount factors agree in pricing
the internationally-traded assets. It also implicitly assumes that any default or haircut is
uniform for domestic and foreign holders of the assets, and that the adopted fiscal policies
do not act as capital controls.

2.2

Producers

In each country there is a continuum i ∈ [0, 1] of firms producing different varieties of goods
using a technology with labor as the only input. Specifically, firm i produces according to
Yt (i) = At Zt (i)Nt (i)α ,

0 < α ≤ 1,

(8)

where At is the aggregate country-wide level of productivity, Zt (i) is idiosyncratic firm
productivity shock, and Nt (i) is the firm’s labor input. Productivity At , {Zt (i)} and their
foreign counterparts follow arbitrary stochastic processes over time.
The firm sells to both the home and foreign market. Specifically, it must satisfy de∗
mand (1) for its good in each market given its price PHt (i) at home and PHt
(i) abroad in

the foreign currency. Therefore, we can write the market clearing for variety i as:9
∗
Yt (i) = CHt (i) + CHt
(i),

(9)

∗
(i) is foreign-market demand for variety i of the home good. The profit of firm i
where CHt

is given by
∗
∗
(i)CHt
(i) − (1 − ςtp )Wt Nt (i),
Πit = (1 − τtv )PHt (i)CHt (i) + (1 + ςtx )Et PHt

(10)

where τtv is the value-added tax (VAT), ςtx is the export subsidy and ςtp is the payroll subsidy.
Note that this equation makes it explicit that exports are not subject to the VAT, or more
specifically VAT is rebated back to the firms upon exporting.10 We define the prices to be
inclusive of the VAT, export subsidy and import tariff, but exclusive of the consumption
´1
subsidy ςtc . Aggregate profits of the home firms are given by Πt ≡ 0 Πit di and aggregate
´1
labor demand is Nt = 0 Nt (i)di.
9

Note that overall demand for good i results from aggregation of demands across all consumers h ∈ [0, 1]

2.3

Price and wage setting

Firms set prices subject to a Calvo friction: in any given period, a firm can adjust its prices
with probability 1 − θp , and maintains its previous-period price otherwise. The firm sets
prices to maximize the expected net present value of profits conditional on no price change,
P∞ s−t 
i
d
s=t θp Et Θt,s Πs /(1 + τs ) , subject to the production technology and demand equations
given above, and where τsd is the dividend-income (or profit) tax payed by stock holders.
We now need to make an assumption regarding the currency of price-setting. We assume
that domestic prices are always set in the currency of the consumer and inclusive of the VAT
tax. We denote the domestic period t reset price of firm i by P̄Ht (i), so that firm’s i current
price is given by
PHt (i) =


 PH,t−1 (i), w/prob θp ,
 P̄Ht (i),

(11)

w/prob 1 − θp .

The foreign price can be set either in the producer currency, often referred to as producer
currency pricing (PCP), or in the local currency, referred to as local currency pricing (LCP).
Producer currency pricing Consistent with the standard definition of PCP we assume
that the firm chooses the home-currency reset price P̄Ht , while the foreign-market price
satisfies the law of one price:
∗
PHt
(i) = PHt (i)

1 1 − τtv
,
Et 1 + ςtx

(12)

where Et is the nominal exchange rate defined as the price of one unit of foreign currency
in terms of units of home currency, hence higher values of Et correspond to home currency
depreciation. In words, the firm sets a common price P̄Ht (i) for both markets, and its
foreign-market price equals this price converted into foreign currency and adjusted for border
taxes—the export subsidy and the VAT reimbursement. The reset price satisfies the following
condition (see Appendix A.1):

This implies that the preset price P̄Ht (i) is a constant markup over the weighted-average
expected future marginal costs during the period for which the price is in effect. Equations
(11)–(13) together with the definition of the price index in (2), describe the evolution of
home firms’ prices in the home and foreign markets under PCP.
Local currency pricing Under LCP the firm sets both a home-market price P̄Ht (i) in

Keynesian literature, as derived, for example, in Galí (2008). Wage setting (19), together
with the wage evolution analogous to (11), characterize equilibrium wage dynamics.

Government and country budget constraint

We assume that the government must balance its budget each period, returning all seigniorage and tax revenues in the form of lump-sum transfers to the households (Tt ). This is
without loss of generality since Ricardian equivalence holds in this model. The government
budget constraint in period t is
Mt − Mt−1 + T Rt = Tt ,

where Mt − Mt−1 is seigniorage income from money supply. The tax revenues from distortionary taxes T Rt are given by

This completes the description of the setup of the model. Given initial conditions and
home and foreign government policies—taxes and money supply—the equations above characterize equilibrium price and wage dynamics in the economy. Given prices firms satisfy
product demand in domestic and foreign markets, and given wages households satisfy labor
demand of firms. Asset prices are such that asset markets are in equilibrium given asset demand by home and foreign households, and consumer money demand equals money supply
in both markets.

2.5

Assumptions

Before turning to the results of our analysis, we highlight that several of the assumptions
made in the model setup to ease exposition can be generalized without impacting our results.
These include assumptions on:
Functional forms We assume CES consumption aggregators and monopolistic competition, but the results hold under more general environments. For instance, our results
generalize to the case of monopolistic competition with non-constant desired markups (e.g.,
as under Kimball, 1995, demand), as well as to the case of oligopolistic competition with
strategic complementarities (e.g., as in Atkeson and Burstein, 2008). Departing from CES
consumption aggregators and monopolistic competition substantially increases the notational burden, but leaves the analysis largely unchanged. We can also allow for a general
non-separable utility function in consumption and labor without altering conclusions. We
have assumed home bias in preferences, but no non-tradable goods or trade costs, yet our
results immediately extend to these more general economies.12 Similarly, we have adopted a
money-in-the-utility framework where real money balances are separable from consumption
and leisure, but all results are unchanged when money is introduced via a cash-in-advance
constraint.
Government policy instruments We formulate our model using money supply as the
instrument of monetary policy (money supply rule) in both countries. We could alternatively have performed our analysis using interest rate rules or exchange rate rules without
any alterations to our equivalence results.13 As in the New Keynesian literature, in our
environment, the nominal interest rate is the only money market variable relevant for the
rest of the allocation. Consequently, we could also focus on the cashless limit, to which our
12

Note that non-tradable goods are equivalent in our analysis to domestic goods produced for domestic
market, and require no special treatment in the design of a fiscal devaluation.
13
See Benigno, Benigno, and Ghironi (2007) for the design of an interest rate rule to maintain a fixed
exchange rate.

13

equivalence results also apply. We further discuss some of these issue in Section 4.1. For
simplicity, we start from a situation where initial taxes are zero and characterize the required
changes in taxes, but all the results generalize to a situation where initial taxes are not zero
(see footnote 22).
Price setting frictions Our results generalize to departures from Calvo price and wage
setting. Any model of time-contingent price adjustment with arbitrary heterogeneity in price
adjustment hazard rates would deliver similar results. It can also be generalized to a menu
cost model in which the menu cost is given in real units, e.g. in labor, as is commonly assumed,
since in this case the decision to adjust prices will depend only on real variables (including
relative prices) which stay unchanged across nominal and fiscal devaluations. Furthermore,
our equivalence results also apply in other environments where devaluations have real effects
without nominal frictions, as for example in the neoclassical model of Feenstra (1985) with
cash-in-advance constraints in home and foreign currency.14 In Section 4.3 we discuss further
extensions to our price-setting assumptions.

Fiscal Devaluations

In this section we formally define the concept of a fiscal devaluation and present our main
results on the equivalence between nominal and fiscal devaluations, first for complete and
then for incomplete asset markets, as well as for the special case of a one-time unanticipated
devaluation. We complete the section with the discussion of government revenue neutrality
of fiscal devaluations.
Definition Consider an equilibrium path of the model economy described above, along
which the nominal exchange rate follows
Et = E0 (1 + δt )

for t ≥ 0,

for some (stochastic) sequence {δt }t≥0 . Here δt denotes the percent nominal devaluation of
the home currency relative to period 0. We refer to such an equilibrium path as a nominal
{δt }-devaluation. Denote by {Mt } the path of home money supply that is associated with the
nominal devaluation. A fiscal {δt }-devaluation is a sequence {Mt0 , τtm , ςtx , τtv , ςtp , ςtc , τtn , τtd }t≥0
of money supply and taxes that achieves the same equilibrium allocation of consumption,
output and labor supply, but for which the equilibrium exchange rate is fixed, Et0 ≡ E0 for

In this environment Feenstra (1985) studied how the tariff policy could improve over a nominal
devaluation.

14

all t ≥ 0. Note that, in general, we do not restrict the path of the exchange rate under a
nominal devaluation.15
Before formulating and proving our main results, we manipulate the two equilibrium
conditions which play the central role in our analysis. First, we divide the home country
budget constraint (22) by Pt∗ Et to obtain:

(24)

is the home’s terms of trade—the ratio of the import price index to the export price index
adjusted for border taxes. Second, we rewrite the international risk sharing conditions (7)
using the definitions of the home and foreign stochastic discount factors (3) and (6):

is the consumer-price real exchange rate.
These conditions highlight the role of the two international relative prices—the terms
of trade St in shaping the trade balance on the right-hand side of the country budget constraint (23) and the real exchange rate Qt in the international risk sharing condition (25).
The exact roles of these two relative prices changes as we consider different asset market
structures. But a fiscal devaluation will, in general, need to mimic the behavior of these two
relative prices to replicate the equilibrium allocation resulting from a nominal devaluation.

3.1

Complete asset markets

In this case we assume that countries have access to a full set of one-period Arrow securities
and there is perfect risk sharing across countries.
15

For example, one can examine simple one-time devaluations with δt = 0 for t < T and δt = δ for t ≥ T
with some stochastic or deterministic T ≥ 0.

15

Proposition 1 Under complete international asset markets, and for both producer and local
currency pricing, a fiscal {δt }-devaluation can be achieved by one of the two policies:
τtm = ςtx = ςtc = τtn = τtd = δt ,
τtv = ςtp =

δt
,
1 + δt

ςtc = τtn = δt

(FD0 )

or
and

τtd = 0,

(FD00 )

as well as a suitable choice of {Mt0 }, for t ≥ 0.
The formal proof, contained in Appendix A.2, demonstrates that both fiscal devaluation
options {Et0 , τtm , ςtx , τtv , ςtp , ςtc , τtn , τtd } and a nominal devaluation {Et , 0} satisfy the equilibrium
system under the same allocation of output, consumption and labor supply. This means
that taxes in both the tariff-based (FD0 ) and VAT-based (FD00 ) policies affect the equilibrium
conditions exactly in the same way as changes in the exchange rate, and in particular, cancel
each other out from the equilibrium conditions not directly affected by the exchange rate.
The reason the combinations of taxes in (FD0 ) and (FD00 ) support a fiscal devaluation is
that they ensure that all reset prices and wages remain the same, and given unchanged prices
the rest of the allocation also remains unchanged. Indeed, to leave the wage setting in (19)
unchanged requires the parity between the labor income tax and the consumption subsidy
(τtn = ςtc ), a policy change that keeps the labor wedge unaltered. Analogously, domestic
price setting in (13) requires the parity between the VAT and the payroll subsidy (τtv = ςtp ).
Now consider international price setting, where the VAT or the border taxes need to mimic
the effects of an exchange rate movement on both export and import prices:
1 + ςtx
1 + τtm
Et
=
=
= 1 + δt .
v
v
1 − τt

(27)

Indeed, tax policies satisfying (27) result in the same international prices under both PCP
(see (12) and (16)) and LCP (see (15) and (17)). The taxes described so far are sufficient to
replicate the path of all nominal prices and wages, as well as the terms of trade in (24), but
not the real exchange rate in (26), which additionally requires the use of the consumption
subsidy, ςtc = δt . This summarizes the logic behind the policies in (FD0 ) and (FD00 ).16
Under complete markets, the international risk sharing condition (25) becomes the familiar Backus-Smith condition:



Ct
Ct∗

σ
= λQt ,

(28)

which ties the relative consumptions of the two countries to the real exchange rate, and
where the constant λ is recovered from the intertemporal budget constraint of the country,
Under complete markets, the use of the profit tax τtd is merely needed to avoid second-order distortions
in price setting under the tariff-based policy (FD0 ).
16

16

which depends on relative prices and in particular the evolution of the terms of trade (see
Appendix A.2). This implies that the consumption allocation also remains unchanged under
(FD0 ) and (FD00 ) relative to a nominal devaluation, given that, as we established, these
policies leave unchanged all prices, including the terms of trade and the real exchange rate.
And once we have established that {Ct , Ct∗ } follows the same path, consumptions and outputs
of every variety, as well as labor demand and supply, must also follow the same path to satisfy
good and labor demand conditions given unchanged wages and prices.
For a more intuitive narrative, let us consider a particular price setting environment,
namely PCP. In this case an exchange rate devaluation at home depreciates home’s terms
of trade. As home’s import price rises relative to its export price, there is an expenditure
switching effect that reallocates home and foreign demand towards home goods. This is the
standard channel through which exchange rate depreciations have expansionary effects on
the economy. A fiscal devaluation mimics the same movement in the terms of trade (24),
which under PCP we rewrite using the law of one price conditions (12) and (16) as:
St =

PF∗ t 1 + ςtx
,
Et
PHt 1 − τtv

Given the producer currency prices PHt and PF∗ t , a fiscal devaluation requires either τtv =
δt /(1 + δt ) or ςtx = τtm = δt . That is, an exchange rate depreciation given producer prices
raises the relative price of home imports to home exports. A fiscal devaluation generates the
same relative price adjustment by means of either an increase in VAT or imposition of an
import tariff and export subsidy. The VAT affects international relative prices because it is
both reimbursed to home exporters and imposed at the border on home importers of foreign
goods, and hence no additional border tax (import tariff or export subsidy) is required when
the VAT is used. An increased VAT must be coupled with a payroll subsidy ςtp = τtv in
order to avoid a negative wedge in the home price setting and good supply, absent under a
nominal devaluation.
The use of the consumption subsidy ςtc is important for replicating the behavior of the real
exchange rate, which depreciates under a nominal devaluation with sticky prices. Indeed,
without the use of the consumption subsidy, both the import tariff and the VAT policies,
despite mimicking the terms of trade movement, raise the home price level by making foreign
goods more expansive. This results in an appreciated real exchange rate which needs to be
undone by the consumption subsidy. The use of the consumption subsidy however distorts
the wage setting and labor supply decision, which needs to be offset using a proportional
labor income tax, τtn = ςtc = δt . In the presence of international risk sharing, the movement
in the real exchange rate matters for the relative consumption allocation across countries,
17

and consequently the consumption subsidy is essential. However, there are two cases when
mimicking the real exchange rate, and hence using the consumption subsidy and income tax,
is not essential for the equivalence. The first is the case of financial autarky and balanced
trade which we discuss in Appendix A.3; the second is the case of incomplete international
asset markets under an unanticipated devaluation which we study in detail in Section 3.3.
Discussion We now highlight some interesting features about our equivalence result. First,
a surprising finding is that the same policies work under both LCP and PCP, independently
of whether the law of one price holds. This is because the policies replicate not only the
terms of trade, but also the deviations from the law of one price, whenever they exist under
LCP, and all relative prices more generally. Note however that despite the equivalence result
holding independently of pricing assumptions, the allocations under LCP and PCP can be
substantially different (as discussed, for example, in Lane, 2001). In particular, under PCP
the terms of trade depreciates with a devaluation, while under LCP it appreciates on impact
(see Obstfeld and Rogoff, 2000).
Secondly, fiscal devaluations mimic not only real variables and relative prices, but also
nominal prices. This is because under the staggered price setting environment replicating
the path of nominal prices is essential in order not to distort relative prices, and hence
relative output, across firms that do and do not adjust prices. As a consequence, since fiscal
devaluations mimic all nominal prices, the standard redistribution concerns associated with
inflation are identical across fiscal and nominal devaluations.
Third, the fiscal devaluation policies depend only on {δt }, the desired devaluation sequence, and not directly on the details of the model economy. In this sense, fiscal devaluation
policies are robust—they are insensitive to the micro structure of the economy and require
little information about it. The optimal size of the devaluation, however, depends on model
details.
Finally, we emphasize that a fiscal devaluation requires no active adjustment to money
supply, and the path of home money supply is determined endogenously by equilibrium
money demand in (5) given the decision of the home central bank to implement a particular
path of the exchange rate under respectively a nominal and a fiscal devaluation.17 We return
to the discussion of monetary policy rules sustaining a fiscal devaluation in Section 4.1.
17

The path of the money supply under a fiscal devaluation is, in general, different from that under a
nominal devaluation, which however is not consequential for the rest of the allocation when money enters
the utility function separably. Under the alternative assumption, or if we additionally required to replicate
the path of the real money holdings, the equivalence requires the use of an additional tax on money holdings
to mimic the reduced money demand under an expected nominal devaluation (see Appendix A.2).

18

3.2

Incomplete asset markets

We now consider the case of incomplete asset markets. The equivalence result follows closely
that of Proposition 1 under complete markets, and in general terms can be stated as follows:
Lemma 1 Under arbitrary asset markets, both (FD0 ) and (FD00 ) constitute {δt }-fiscal devaluation policies as long as the foreign-currency payoffs of all internationally-traded assets
{Dtj∗ } are unchanged.
Proof: As we show in the proof of Proposition 1, (FD0 ) and (FD00 ) replicate changes in all
relative prices including the terms of trade and the real exchange rate. The same arguments
go through in the case of incomplete markets as the relevant equilibrium conditions are the
same. The main difference with the complete markets case is that now the general versions of
the country budget constraint and international risk sharing conditions (23) and (25) apply.
j∗
As long as real asset payoffs and prices {dj∗
t , qt } are unchanged in terms of the foreign final

good, conditions (23) and (25) are satisfied under the original allocation {Ct , Ct∗ } and the
original asset demand {Btj }. Since under these policies {Pt∗ } is unchanged, it is enough to
j∗
j∗ ∗
require that {Dtj∗ , Qj∗
t } are unchanged where Dt = dt Pt is the foreign-currency nominal

payoff of an asset. Finally, the fundamental price of the asset satisfies

hence under no-bubble asset pricing we only need to require that the path of foreign-currency
nominal asset payoffs {Dtj∗ } is unchanged. 
Our equivalence results therefore apply to settings with arbitrarily rich, albeit incomplete,
financial markets. Solving for international portfolio choice under these settings is notoriously complicated (e.g., see discussion in Devereux and Sutherland, 2008). Nevertheless,
our analysis goes through as we do not need to characterize the solution, but merely verify
whether an allocation that is an equilibrium outcome under one set of policies remains an
equilibrium allocation under another set of policies.
We next can consider a variety of asset market structures in view of Lemma 1. First
f∗
consider one-period risk-free foreign-currency nominal bond. This bond pays Dt+1
≡ 1 in

f∗
foreign currency and its foreign-currency price is Qt = Et Θ∗t+1 = 1/(1 + i∗t+1 ), where i∗t+1

is the foreign-currency risk-free nominal interest rate. This asset satisfies requirements in
Lemma 1, and hence (FD0 ) and (FD00 ) constitute fiscal devaluation policies without additional
instruments. The same applies to long-term foreign-currency debt as well.

19

h
Next consider one-period home-currency risk-free bond with a payoff of Dt+1
= 1 in
h∗
= 1/Et+1 in foreign-currency. This asset does not satisfy
home currency, and hence Dt+1

Lemma 1, and hence we need to introduce partial default (haircut τth ) to make its foreigncurrency payoff the same as under a nominal devaluation. A haircut policy on one-period
home-currency debt that is required for equivalence satisfies:
h
≡
1 − τt+1

Et
Et+1

h
=
τt+1

⇔

δt+1 − δt
,
1 + δt+1

(29)

i.e., the haircut at t + 1 equals the incremental percent devaluation in that period. With
this haircut, the equilibrium payoff of the home-currency debt under a fiscal devaluation is
h∗
h
Dt+1
= 1 − τt+1
=

1 + δt
,
1 + δt+1

and hence its foreign-currency price becomes
 ∗
 ∗
h
Qh∗
t = Et Θt+1 (1 − τt+1 ) = (1 + δt )Et Θt+1 /(1 + δt+1 ) .
h∗
This haircut keeps the returns on the bond (Dt+1
/Qh∗
t ) unchanged in the foreign currency

across nominal and fiscal devaluations, which is sufficient to ensure the rest of the equivalence.
Note that the partial default in (29) exactly replicates the valuation effects on home-currency
assets associated with exchange rate movements (e.g., see Gourinchas and Rey, 2007).18
As the last example, we consider international trade in equities, for which:19
Dthe∗ =

Πt
(1 + τtd )Et

and

Dtf e∗ = Π∗t .

From equations (10) for profits and its foreign counterpart, we observe that both (FD0 ) and
(FD00 ) keep both Πt /[(1 + τtd )Et ] and Π∗t unchanged relative to a nominal devaluation, and
hence the conditions of Lemma 1 are satisfied without additional instruments. Indeed, the
VAT-cum-payroll subsidy under (FD00 ) reduces the foreign-currency profits of home firms,
just like a nominal devaluation. Similarly, the profit (dividend-income) tax does the same
under a tariff-based devaluation (FD0 ). This, in particular, replicates the distributional and
balance-sheet effects of a nominal devaluation.
We summarize the results above in:
18

Under a representative agent economy, it is sufficient to require a partial default (haircut) only on
all internationally held home-currency bonds; in a heterogeneous-agent economy exact equivalence requires
partial default on all outstanding home-currency debt, including the within-country holdings across agents,
otherwise fiscal devaluations will introduce additional distributions effects beyond those under a nominal
devaluation. Further note that for long-term home-currency debt, the partial default should also extend to
the principal of the debt outstanding.

Proposition 2 Under trade in foreign-currency risk-free bonds and international trade in
equities, a fiscal {δt }-devaluation can be achieved by the same polices (FD0 ) and (FD00 ) as
under complete markets; with trade in home-currency bonds, (FD0 ) and (FD00 ) need to be
complemented with a partial default (haircut) equal to τth = (δt − δt−1 )/(1 + δt ) on all outstanding home-currency debt.
Full policies (FD0 ) and (FD00 ) robustly engineer fiscal devaluations under both complete
and incomplete markets.20 We next study one special case under which the set of policy
instruments needed to implement a fiscal devaluation can be substantially reduced.

3.3

One-time unanticipated devaluation

Consider the case of a one-time unanticipated δ-devaluation at t = 0. Under these circumstances, prior to t = 0, the devaluation is completely unexpected (i.e., a zero probability
event), while at t = 0 the exchange rate devalues by δ once and for all future periods and
states. As we now show, a fiscal devaluation under these circumstances imposes a substantially weaker requirement on the set of fiscal instruments—in particular, the consumption
subsidy and the income tax can be dispensed with—as long as asset markets are incomplete
in the sense that they do not allow for international transfers targeted specifically to the
zero-probability event of an unanticipated devaluation.
Proposition 3 Under incomplete markets, a one-time unanticipated fiscal δ-devaluation
may be attained with one of the two reduced policies:
τtm = ςtx = τtd = δ
τtv = ςtp =

δ
1+δ

ςtc = τtn = 0,

and
and

ςtc = τtn = τtd = 0,

or

(FD0R )
(FD00R )

coupled with a partial default (haircut) τ0h = δ/(1 + δ) on home-currency debt and an unchanged path of money supply Mt0 = Mt , for t ≥ 0.
See Appendix A.4 for the formal proof of this proposition. The main difference of the
reduced policies (FD0R ) and (FD00R ) from the full policies in Propositions 1 and 2, is that
the consumption subsidy and income tax can be dispensed with. This is because under
an unanticipated devaluation we have one less relative price to replicate and that is the
real exchange rate. Note that international risk sharing (25) is unaffected by a one-time
unanticipated jump in the real exchange rate in the event of a devaluation, provided that
20

As Benigno and Kucuk-Tuger (2012) highlight, the real allocations are very sensitive to small changes
in the number of assets traded. Despite this, the fiscal equivalence propositions remain the same across
arbitrary degrees of asset market completeness.

21

international asset markets are incomplete. As a result, only the path of the terms of trade,
but not of the real exchange rate, has to be mimicked in this case.
Intuitively, the terms of trade is the relative price affecting the terms of exchange in a
given state, as reflected in the flow budget constraint (23). In contrast, the real exchange rate
is the relative price affecting savings (trade across time) and portfolio choice (risk-sharing
across states of the world), as reflected in (25). Since the devaluation is unanticipated,
savings and portfolio choice decisions are unaffected prior to the devaluation (for t < 0).
Furthermore, as it is a one-time permanent devaluation, after it happens at t = 0 the
future dynamics of the real exchange rate, Qt+1 /Qt for t ≥ 0, remains the same under a
reduced fiscal devaluation as under a nominal devaluation. Consequently, the savings and
portfolio choice decisions are also unaffected for t ≥ 0, and the jump in Qt at t = 0 remains
inconsequential for the equilibrium allocation. This is why the consumption subsidy can be
dispensed with, and by consequence the income tax is also not needed since there is no labor
supply wedge to offset.21
Implementability Arguably, the reduced VAT-based policy (FD00R ) under a one-time
unanticipated devaluation is the most practical from a policy perspective. Indeed, it requires only a one-time change in two widely used tax rates—an increase in the value-added
tax and a reduction in the payroll tax. The requirement, however, is that these tax changes
are equally unanticipated, and in Section 5 we study numerically the departures from equivalence when the fiscal adjustment happens with a lag.
It might appear that while the size of a nominal devaluation is unrestricted with δ ∈
(0, +∞), even in theory the size of the tax adjustment is limited as it cannot exceed 100%.
This is actually not the case. Theoretically a fiscal devaluation of arbitrary size δ ≥ 0 is
also possible. For example, under (FD00R ), a δ-devaluation requires setting VAT and payroll
subsidy at δ/(1 + δ) ∈ (0, 1).22 We further consider the issue of the plausible magnitude of
a fiscal devaluation in Section 5.
21

Note that consumption subsidy and income tax do not affect the country budget constraint (23) directly,
but they do lead to distributional consequences between the home government and the home households, as
we discuss in Section 3.4 (cf. parts (i) and (ii) of Proposition 4).
22
If there were initial non-zero VAT and payroll taxes in place, one can verify that the required new taxes
under a fiscal δ-devaluation are:
τv =

τ̄ v + δ
1+δ

and

τp =

τ̄ p − δ
,
1+δ

where τ̄ v and τ̄ p are the pre-devaluation levels of VAT and payroll taxes. Note that for any size of devaluation δ, we still have τ v < 1 and ς p ≡ −τ p < 1. The larger is the initial level of VAT, the smaller is a required
further increase in the VAT to achieve a given level of devaluation.

Government revenue neutrality

We now study how fiscal devaluations affect government revenues over and above the effects
of a nominal devaluation. We first show that the full fiscal devaluation policies (FD0 ) and
(FD00 ) are exactly revenue neutral, state-by-state and period-by-period, that is lead to exactly
the same effects on the government budget as a nominal devaluation. We then analyze the
one-time unanticipated policies (FD0R ) and (FD00R ) which do not utilize consumption and
income taxes, and show that these policies generate additional tax revenues in periods (and
states of the world) when the country runs trade deficits.

Under (FD0 ), δtm = t = δt and δtv = 0; under (FD00 ), δtm = 0 and δtv = t = δt . The
one-time policies, (FD0R ) and (FD00R ) differ only in that t = 0 and δt ≡ δ for t ≥ 0. With
this notation, we can rewrite incremental government tax revenues (21) generated from fiscal
devaluations as:23

Given this, we prove:
Proposition 4 (i) The full fiscal devaluation policies, (FD0 ) and (FD00 ), are exactly government revenue neutral state-by-state and in every time period. (ii) Under reduced fiscal

The formal prove of this proposition is contained in Appendix A.5. The first part of the
proposition follows immediately from (30) when we substitute in the full fiscal devaluation
policies (FD0 ) or (FD00 ) which results in T Rt ≡ 0. The more involved case is when the
reduced policies (FD0R ) or (FD00R ) are used, which when substituted into (30) result in T Rt =
δ/(1 + δ) · (Pt Ct − Wt Nt ). This suggests that the additional government revenues from a
reduced fiscal devaluation are proportional to the difference between total consumption and
total production expenditure (equal in our case to the wage bill). The former exceeds the

latter when either the country runs a trade deficit or earns aggregate profits, as formally
reflected in (31).24 To summarize, a one-time unanticipated fiscal devaluation policy will
generate additional fiscal revenues in the periods in which the country runs a trade deficit,
as long as aggregate profits in the economy are non-negative. This is an appealing feature
of this policy from a practical point of view.25

Extensions

In this section we discuss four extensions to the benchmark environment discussed in previous
sections. First, we describe how to engineer a fiscal devaluation in a currency union. Second,
we allow for capital as a variable input in production besides labor. Third, we discuss our
tax pass-through assumptions and evaluate the case of asymmetric pass-through of VAT and
payroll taxes into prices. Fourth, we allow for labor mobility.

4.1

Fiscal devaluations in a currency union

We now consider the implementation of a fiscal devaluation in a monetary union, where the
member-countries give up their monetary policy independence and adopt a common currency
hence abandoning the possibility of a nominal devaluation.26 We consider a general multicountry world economy in which a subset of countries forms a currency union, while the
remaining countries maintain their own currencies and independent monetary policy.
In general, as we discussed above, a nominal devaluation requires a change in the home
money supply. The distinctive feature of a currency union is that the money supply to
individual member-countries becomes an endogenous variable, and the relative money supply
between the countries adjusts in order to satisfy the fixed nominal value of the currency across
member-countries. The union-wide central bank controls only the overall money supply to
all country members, or alternatively a union-wide nominal interest rate. The questions we
ask in this section are whether the same policies we studied before still constitute a fiscal
devaluation and whether a coordinated policy action from the union central bank is required.
To summarize our findings up front, the same fiscal devaluation policies proposed earlier
24

Indeed, the VAT-cum-payroll subsidy taxes all goods supplied for consumption in the domestic market
(Pt Ct ) and subsidizes production expenditure (Wt Nt ). The tariff-cum-export-subsidy is a tax on net imports
(−N Xt ), while the additional dividend tax under this policy taxes profits (Πt ). As Proposition 4 shows, the
two policies lead to the same government revenues.
25
This also implies, as we show in Appendix A.5, that the net present value of additional fiscal surpluses
from an unanticipated fiscal devaluation is non-negative when the value of the country’s business sector
(stock market capitalization plus the value of unincorporated business) exceeds its net foreign liabilities,
which is easily satisfied for the majority of developed countries.

are still effective in a currency union. Furthermore, in a cashless world in which monetary
authorities follow interest rate rules, any member of a currency union can implement a fiscal
devaluation unilaterally without coordination from the union central bank. However, more
generally, away from the cashless limit, a fiscal devaluation by a member of a currency union
needs to be accommodated by an increase in money supply by the union central bank (automatic under an interest-rate rule) and a corresponding transfer of the extra seigniorage
revenues from the union central bank to the country-member implementing a fiscal devaluation. In Section 5 we show in a calibrated model that the effects of these seigniorage transfers
are negligible, and the unilateral fiscal policy comes very close to replicating a devaluation.
In the case of multiple countries, two clarifications need to be made. First, the equivalence
now refers to the following two counterfactual scenarios: in one, a country is a member of
a larger currency union and implements a fiscal devaluation; and in the other, the country
is not part of the union (e.g., leaves the union) and implements a nominal devaluation
against the currency of the union, while all other members of the union remain a part of
it.27 Second, the equivalence result allows for arbitrary monetary policy rules in countries
outside the currency union. In particular, the equivalence extends to the equilibrium path in
countries outside the currency union and among other things holds for the nominal exchange
rate of these countries against the currency union. Pinning down the specific equilibrium
path of the nominal exchange rates between the currency union and the outside countries
requires details of the micro environment and the policy rules used, which we do not need
for our equivalence result.28
We now provide the formal extension of the model environment to the case of multiple
countries and the generalization of the fiscal devaluation results.
Setup and additional notation Consider a world consisting of NU + NF + 1 countries
which we denote by k ∈ {0, . . . , NU + NF } ≡ W, where NU ≥ 1 and NF ≥ 1. We denote
0

by Etk,k a bilateral nominal exchange rate between countries k, k 0 ∈ W in units of currency
k for one unit of currency k 0 . NU countries form a currency union U = {1, . . . , NU } and
0

hence have Etk,k ≡ 1 for all k, k 0 ∈ U. We denote the exchange rate between the union
currency and a country k ∈ W\U outside the currency union by EtU,k . NF countries, k ∈
{NU + 1, . . . , NU + NF } ≡ F, follow independent monetary policies (money supply or interest
27

The alternative scenario is when all countries leave the union, which we do not consider here since it
results in a large number of possible counterfactual equilibrium pathes depending on the monetary policy
adopted by each country leaving the currency union.
28
The union central bank can always target its (average) nominal exchange rate with a given (set of) trade
partner(s), in which case a fiscal devaluation by a member of the currency union results in an equivalent
devaluation against this (set of) trade partner(s).

rate rules) and hence have floating currencies. The remaining country, k = 0, chooses
between two regimes. First, it may choose to manage its exchange rate against the currency
union, Et0,U , in particular carry out a dynamic devaluation δt = Et0,U , where we normalize
for simplicity E00,U = 1. Second, it may choose to be part of the currency union (hence have
Et0,U ≡ 1) and carry out a fiscal δt -devaluation. We denote by Ũ ≡ U ∪ {0} the extended
currency union in this case, and Ũ = U in the alternative case when country 0 has an
independent monetary policy.
In terms of notation relative to Section 2, we now use country index k ∈ W on all country
specific variables (previously we had no identifier for home and star for foreign). We only
need to generalize the expression for the consumption of the imported goods, which now
becomes an index:

the two-country setup. The price indexes PF,t

The remaining equilibrium conditions are largely unchanged, in particular, this concerns
the consumer and country budget constraints, risk sharing conditions, money demand, price
and wage setting, as well as the expressions for the terms of trade and the CPI-based real
exchange rate. Each country has a stochastic discount factor Θkt,s , and now the risk sharing
conditions (7) must be satisfied for each pair of countries and for each internationally traded
asset.
What is different now, is the role of the union central bank that provides money supply
MtU to satisfy money demands Mtk in the member-countries:
X
MtU =
Mtk .
k∈Ũ

The central bank collects seigniorage revenues from money supply and redistributes it back
to the member-countries:
U
MtU − Mt−1

Ωkt ,

k∈Ũ

where Ωkt is the transfer to country k.
Consequently, the government budget constraint of country k ∈ Ũ instead of (20) becomes
Ωkt + T Rtk = Ttk ,
26

where T Rtk ≡ 0 when the country does not attempt a fiscal devaluation. That is, when
part of a currency union, the revenues of the government from seigniorage under an independent monetary policy are replaced with the transfers of a share in the union-wide
seigniorage revenues. The government budget constraint for countries outside the currency
union stays unchanged. We assume that these countries follow independent monetary policy
rules—formulated in terms of money supply, interest rate or exchange rate—which can be
conditioned on any variable, nominal or real, with the exception of the bilateral nominal
exchange rate with country 0, which is not well-defined when it is part of a currency union.
The rules can, however, condition on the exchange rate with the currency union.
Fiscal devaluations in a currency union Consider an equilibrium in this economy,
when country 0 is not part of the currency union. In this case, we have an equilibrium path
for exchange rates {EtU,k , Et0,k }k∈F and Et0,U = δt (with initial normalization E00,U = δ0 = 1)
which satisfy the no arbitrage relation:
Et0,k = δt · EtU,k .
Therefore, a nominal {δt }-devaluation against the currency union results in a devaluation of size δt · EtU,k /E0U,k against country k, which depends on the movement of union–
country-k exchange rate EtU,k /E0U,k . This equilibrium path is associated with an allocation
{Ctk , Ytk , Ntk }k∈W supported by prices, asset values and money.
We now define a fiscal devaluation by country 0 when it is a part of the currency union
and hence EtU,0 ≡ 1. In this case, a fiscal devaluation policy involves the same set of fiscal
instruments as in Section 3 used by country 0, as well as the money supply and seigniorage
transfers by the union central bank, {MtU 0 , Ωk0
t }t≥0,k∈Ũ , which result in the same equilibrium
path {Ctk , Ytk , Ntk }k∈W as a nominal {δt }-devaluation against the currency union. We prove
the following generalization:
Proposition 5 The fiscal devaluation policies in Propositions 1–3 still constitute a fiscal
{δt }-devaluation in a currency union, provided that the union central bank follows
X
00
MtU 0 = Mt00 +
Mtk
and
Ω00
t = ∆Mt ,
k∈U

where Mt00 is the money supply under a fiscal devaluation, as in Propositions 1–3 respectively.
Money supply in all other countries (Mtk , k ∈ W\{0}) and seigniorage transfers to the other
members of the currency union (Ωkt , k ∈ U) are the same as under the nominal devaluation.
We omit the proof of this proposition for brevity, as it follows the same steps as the proof
of Proposition 1 and Lemma 1 by noting that the country budget constraints (23) and
27

international risk sharing conditions (25) generalize directly to the multi-country case, as
well as the country’s terms of trade (24) and real exchange rate (26).29 Note that the
fiscal devaluation policy must affect international transactions symmetrically vis-à-vis all
trade partners of the country, both inside and outside the currency union. For example,
an increase in the VAT needs to be applied to all imports (reimbursed on all exporters)
independently of the country of origin (destination).
The distinctive feature of a fiscal devaluation in a currency union is that now the union
central bank needs to increase the money supply exactly to accommodate the increase in
money demand in country 0 triggered by the fiscal devaluation policy, as well as transfer the
additional seigniorage revenues to country 0. The union central bank does not need to worry
about the distribution of the money supply between the members of the currency union, as
this happens endogenously given the fixed exchange rate (common currency) between the
member-countries.30
The same outcome can be obtained with a union-wide interest rate rule, by setting a
path for iUt+1 . In this case, the equivalence requires no active monetary policy response from
the union central bank, but merely that it follows the same iUt+1 -policy rule as under the
alternative scenario of the nominal devaluation, which endogenously results in the path of
money supply {MtU 0 } supporting a fiscal devaluation.31 This is, of course, a more practical
case, which also better fits the reality of monetary policy in the world.
The transfer of additional seigniorage revenues is, in general, needed even under an interest rate policy rule, to keep unchanged the budget constraint of the country implementing
a fiscal devaluation relative to the alternative scenario of a nominal devaluation. We now
provide a limiting result where the seigniorage transfers are not needed. Specifically, consider
the limiting case of a cashless economy by letting χ → 0 in the utility function so that the
money demand (5) shrinks to zero independently of consumption and interest rate. In this
case seigniorage revenues are also arbitrary small, and consequently seigniorage transfers
29

The additional requirement of Lemma 1 that the payoffs of all assets remain the same in the foreign
currency is now modified to allow for any country’s currency foreign to the devaluing country. Therefore,
under incomplete markets, debt in any currency other than country 0 does not require additional instruments,
while debt in home currency of country 0 still requires a partial default.
30
In the case when country 0 is small, in the particular sense that Mt0 /MtU → 0, the changes in Mt0 do not
affect MtU . Therefore, the union central bank does not need to move MtU when a small member of the union
implements a fiscal devaluation. In this case, given MtU , the money supply relocates towards the devaluing
member without affecting the rest of the currency union as the devaluing country is small.
31
From Lemma 1 we know that the union-currency nominal interest rate follows the same path under
a nominal and a fiscal devaluation, which in particular implies that a zero-lower-bound constraint on the
union interest rate policy will be binding to the same extent under a nominal and a fiscal devaluation. It is
important for equivalence, however, that the union central bank follows exactly the same policy rule under a
nominal and a fiscal devaluation, and does not change its objective or target across the two counterfactuals.

28

become inessential. We then have:
Proposition 6 Consider a cashless economy (χ = 0), in which the union central bank
follows a monetary policy rule resulting in a given equilibrium path of the nominal interest
rate, {iUt+1 }. Then a member-country of the currency union can attain a fiscal devaluation
unilaterally without coordination from the union central bank, by means of fiscal policies
described in Propositions 1–3.
In Section 5 we study the importance of violating the seigniorage transfer requirement in a
calibrated model with χ > 0, and find its quantitative importance negligible for the equivalence result. This suggests that Proposition 6 provides a relevant point of approximation
for our analysis.32
To summarize, the fiscal devaluation policies considered earlier in a two-country world
where both countries preserve their monetary policy independence, extend directly to a much
richer setup with multiple countries a subset of which form a currency union. With these
policies, a country within a currency union can replicate the equilibrium path it could have
attained by being outside the currency union and devaluing against the currency of the union.
Finally, under the circumstances likely to be relevant empirically, a fiscal devaluation inside
a currency union can be implemented unilaterally by any country-member of the currency
union without coordination from the union central bank.

4.2

Capital

In this sub-section, we discuss how our characterization of fiscal devaluations change when
we introduce capital into the model as an additional variable input in production. With
capital, additional tax instruments are required to implement a fiscal devaluation, and we
introduce these instruments below. In Section 5, we study the performance of an incomplete
fiscal devaluation policy without these additional instruments in a calibrated model economy
with capital and adjustment costs.
We adopt a formalization where firms frictionlessly rent the services of labor and capital
on centralized spot markets, at prices Wt and Rt , and capital is accumulated by households.
The full model setup is described in Appendix A.6, while here we present the two central new
equilibrium conditions. Given these two conditions, the remaining equilibrium conditions
including price setting, country budget constraint and international risk sharing conditions
are not affected.
32

Indeed, seigniorage plays a small role as a source of government revenues in most developed countries,
which motives the focus on the cashless limit in a large part of the New Keynesian literature (e.g., see
Woodford, 2003).

29

The first of these conditions is the firm’s choice of production inputs:
 (1 − ςtR )Rt
MRTit Nt (i), Kt (i) =
,
(1 − ςtp )Wt

where MRTit Nt (i), Kt (i) is the marginal rate of transformation of one unit of capital for
one unit of labor in the production of firm i, ςtp is the payroll subsidy as before, and now ςtR
is a capital subsidy (or, a subsidy on the firm capital rental expenses). Whenever the payroll
subsidy is used (e.g., as in the VAT-payroll subsidy policy (FD00 )), it has to be complemented
with a uniform capital subsidy:
ςtR ≡ ςtp ,
otherwise firms would have an incentive to substitute labor for capital in production under
a fiscal devaluation—an effect absent in a nominal devaluation.
The second new condition is household optimality with respect to capital accumulation
(see Appendix A.6):

where d is the capital depreciation rate, ςtc is the consumption subsidy as before, and now ςtI
is the investment subsidy (investment tax credit) and τtK is the capital-income tax. The
condition above states that the return on an additional unit of physical capital discounted
with the home stochastic discount factor equals one. It is derived under the assumption
that, without taxes, one unit of the consumption good can be frictionlessly converted into
one unit of the investment good.
As can be seen from this optimality condition, in general, a fiscal devaluation policy will
require
τtK ≡ ςtI ≡ ςtc ,
i.e., a capital-income tax and an investment subsidy both equal to the consumption subsidy
involved. If the investment subsidy is not used together with the consumption subsidy, a fiscal
devaluation distorts the household’s allocation of expenditure in favor of consumption goods
and away from investment goods since the relative price of the investment good increases. If
the capital-income tax is not used together with the consumption subsidy, a fiscal devaluation
distorts the consumption-savings decision in favor of greater capital accumulation due to
increased after-tax returns on capital. Importantly, whenever the consumption subsidy is
not used as part of a fiscal devaluation policy, the capital-income tax and the investment
subsidy will not be used as well. We now summarize these results in the context of fiscal
devaluation policies studied in Section 3:
30

Proposition 7 In an economy with capital as a variable input in production, (i) full fiscal
devaluation policies (FD0 ) and (FD00 ) of Propositions 1–2 need to be extended with a capitalincome tax and investment subsidy, τtK ≡ ςtI ≡ δt , while τtK ≡ ςtI ≡ 0 under reduced
fiscal devaluation policies (FD0R ) and (FD00R ) of Proposition 3; (ii) in addition, VAT-based
fiscal devaluation policies (FD00 ) and (FD00R ) need to be complemented with a capital subsidy,
ςtR ≡ δt /(1 + δt ), while tariff-based policies (FD0 ) and (FD0R ) need not.
If we focus on the reduced VAT-based fiscal devaluation (FD00R ) as the most practical policy,
the only additional tax instrument required is the capital subsidy to firms. The general
principle is that all value added inputs of the firm need to be subsidized at the same rate in
order not to distort the equilibrium mix of the factors of production.

4.3

Tax pass-through

We now turn to the discussion of our assumptions on the sensitivity of prices to exchange
rate and tax changes, relate it to existing empirical evidence and analytically evaluate a
departure from the pass-through assumptions in the main text. For concreteness, we restrict
attention to the VAT-based reduced fiscal devaluation policy (FD00R ) replicating a one-time
unanticipated devaluation (Proposition 3), due to its greater implementability. The propositions on equivalence rely on two sets of assumptions that would be normal to impose in a
standard new Keynesian environment: One, foreign firms pass-through of exchange rate and
VAT changes into the prices at which they sell to the domestic market is the same, all else
equal, that is conditional on the foreign wage. Two, domestic firms pass-through of VAT
and payroll tax to domestic prices is the same, conditional on the domestic wage.
In the medium and long-run, when firms adjust their prices, these assumptions are natural. When the exchange rate and tax changes are large the long-run can be attained very
quickly since firms will choose to adjust prices immediately. The question then is about the
short-run, when as a large body of evidence suggests, prices adjust infrequently and respond
sluggishly to shocks.
We now survey what empirical evidence exists on the short-run response of prices to exchange rate and tax policy changes. The first assumption requires symmetry of pass-through
of exchange rate shocks and VAT shocks into foreign firms prices to the domestic market.
Since existing papers in the literature do not directly address this question, one is necessarily
comparing evidence across different data sets and more importantly comparing cases where
the tax shocks and exchange rate shocks are not necessarily similarly unanticipated or anticipated. Nevertheless, what evidence exists appears to support the assumption of similar

31

pass-through rates. For instance, Campa, Goldberg, and González-Mínguez (2005) estimate
that short-run (one month) pass-through into import prices in the Euro Area is 66% (and
81% in the long-run, after four months). Andrade, Carré, and Bénassy-Quéré (2010) examine data on French exports to the Euro zone over the 1996–2005 period and document that
median pass-through of VAT shocks that occurred in eleven EMU12 partner countries over
this period is 70–82% at a one year horizon. While they lack higher frequency data they
conclude that the evidence is consistent with similar pass-through behavior for exchange rate
and VAT shocks over a year. The evidence also appears consistent with producer currency
pricing.
Evidence on the second assumption on responses of domestic prices to VAT and payroll
is even harder to come by. First, while there exist some studies on VAT pass-through at
various horizons there are very few equivalent studies for payroll taxes. Carbonnier (2007)
studies two French reforms that involved steep decreases in VAT in 1987 and then in 1999
and finds that the pass-through into domestic prices, almost immediately, was 57% in the
new car sales market and 77% in the household repair services market. The extent of passthrough therefore varies by market. There is however no similar evidence for payroll tax
changes in these markets. Further, the tax changes were of a very large magnitude and
consequently more revealing of long-run pass-through.33 The one case study that involved
both a VAT increase and a payroll tax cut is the German VAT increase of 3 percentage
points and a cut in employer and employee payroll contributions by 2.3 percentage points
in 2007. Carare and Danninger (2008) examine the effect of these policy changes on core
inflation. They find evidence of staggered price adjustment to tax shocks. The tax policies
were announced 13 months ahead of actual implementation and, consistent with infrequent
price adjustment, they find that prices adjusted upward prior to implementation. They
conclude that overall pass-through from VAT was 73% with about half of this occurring
in the run-up to implementation and the other half at the time of implementation. This
evidence however cannot be directly used to shed light on the symmetry assumption. Firstly,
they focus on core inflation and do not distinguish between domestic and foreign price passthrough. Secondly, they provide no evidence on pass-through of the payroll tax. Given
that their identification relies on comparing VAT-effected goods with non-VAT goods, they
isolate only the VAT pass-through component. This evidence also does not shed light on
unanticipated tax changes.
The existing evidence therefore does not shed much light on the second assumption.
33

In September 1987, the VAT rate on car sales went down from the luxury-rate of 33.3% to the full-rate
of 18.6%. In September 1999, the VAT rate on housing repair services went down from the full-rate of 20.6%
to the reduced-rate of 5.5%

32

Consequently, we briefly discuss how the equivalence proposition is impacted in the case
of short-run asymmetry in pass-through rates between VAT and payroll tax. Again, for
concreteness, we focus on the case of a one-time unanticipated VAT-based δ-devaluation at
t = 0, in a PCP economy with international trade in foreign-currency bonds only. We now
assume that firms during the period of price non-adjustment mechanically index their price
changes to changes in VAT and payroll taxes, with arbitrary index rates.

Sections 2–3 was done under the assumption ξv = ξp = 0. However, since our policies always
involve a uniform adjustment in VAT and payroll subsidy (τtv = ςtp ), the baseline results
immediately extend to the case of symmetric short-run pass-through, that is ξv = ξp ∈
[0, 1]. We now analyze the asymmetric pass-through case, for concreteness specializing to
0 ≤ ξp < ξv ≤ 1, that is a higher short-run pass-through on VAT changes relative to payroll
tax changes.
Under PCP, the law of one price (12) and (16) still holds for international prices, hence
requiring that the VAT adjusts exactly as in Proposition 3 (τtv ≡ δ/(1 + δ) for t ≥ 0).
Therefore, we need to choose a suitable dynamic path for the payroll subsidy in order to
mimic the behavior of the price index for the home good in the home market, PHt .34 In
Appendix A.7, we prove the following:
Proposition 8 In a PCP economy with international trade in foreign-currency bond and
asymmetric short-run pass-through on VAT and payroll tax, a one-time unanticipated δdevaluation can be first-order implemented with τtv = δ/(1 + δ) for all t ≥ 0 and the following

34

Note that exact equivalence is no longer feasible, since now firms that happen to adjust and that did
not adjust after the tax change will have different relative prices as compared to the case of a nominal
devaluation. This can be seen from (32), where tax changes affect the evolution of prices when firms do not
adjust, while changes in the exchange rate do not. Mimicking, however, the aggregate behavior of the home
price index PHt is sufficient for the first-order equivalence. This is because, given PHt , all other aggregate
relative prices, including the terms of trade, are replicated.

33

Note a number of differences in Proposition 8 from our results in Section 3. First, a
static δ-devaluation requires a dynamic fiscal policy to replicate it, with the payroll subsidy
overshooting in the short run its long-run level of δ. This is required since short-run passthrough of VAT is larger than that of the payroll tax, and hence the payroll subsidy should
overshoot the level of the VAT in the short run to compensate for this difference. Second,
the equivalence is only first-order and not exact. This is because under fiscal devaluations
the firms adjusting prices end up with lower prices relative to non-adjusters, as compared
to the nominal devaluation; yet, the overall price index follows the same path. Third,
implementation relies on information about the micro structure of the economy, in particular
the short-run pass-through rates ξp and ξv , and the measure of price stickiness λ. Finally,
this proposition only applies to PCP, but not LCP, economies. Furthermore, in general these
two instruments are insufficient to implement a fiscal devaluation in an LCP economy with
arbitrary tax pass-through, since in this case we are one instrument short to replicate the

Labor mobility

Our baseline setup does not allow for labor mobility across countries, however, the analyzed
fiscal devaluation policies can be extended to economies with labor mobility. Labor mobility
can be introduced into the model in different ways. Consider the case in which the home
workers have the option to be employed in the foreign country, but still have their consumption at home.35 In this case, the no arbitrage condition for workers requires the equalization
of nominal payoffs in the two locations:
Wt
= Et Wt∗ .
1 + τtn
Since as we have discussed, a fiscal devaluation needs to replicate the path of {Wt , Wt∗ }, the
use of income tax becomes essential under labor mobility. Indeed, the full policies (FD0 ) and
(FD00 ) of Propositions 1 and 2 do satisfy this requirement, and continue to implement fiscal
devaluation even with labor mobility of this type.36 An important qualification in this case
is that income taxes need to be based on the source of income rather than the residency of
the worker.
35

An alternative case is when workers can only choose to migrate fully, moving the location of both their
employment and consumption. Since fiscal devaluations replicate all real variables and relative prices, the
equivalence extends immediately to this case.
36
In contrast, fiscal implementation of the first best allocation in Adao, Correia, and Teles (2009) requires
additional fiscal instruments under labor mobility.

Numerical Illustration

In this section we numerically evaluate the impact of fiscal devaluations. We compare allocations and welfare across various cases of complete and incomplete fiscal devaluations.
Specifically, we consider the case when only a VAT-payroll tax swap is used with no change
in capital taxes, the case of an anticipated fiscal devaluation, the case of smaller than optimal
fiscal devaluation, and the case without seignorage transfer in a currency union.
To do this we calibrate a small open economy to some features of Spain and its recent
experience during the crisis. This is a variant of the model in Section 2, retaining the
functional forms and extended to include capital (Section 4.2). Wages are assume to be
sticky and prices flexible.
The production function is Cobb-Douglas, Yt = At Ntα Kt1−α . We in addition incorporate
adjustment costs to capital and the accumulation equation for capital is given by:

2
φI Kt+1
It = Kt+1 − (1 − δ)Kt +
− δ Kt ,
2
Kt
where φI controls the magnitude of adjustment costs to capital.
We focus on incomplete markets with only bonds denominated in the foreign currency
(that is in euros) and impose that the world interest rate facing domestic households depends
on the amount the country as a whole borrows. Specifically,
i∗t+1 = i∗ + ψ eB

∗ −B

t+1


− 1 + εr,t ,

where B ∗ is the steady state debt level, i∗ = (1/β) − 1. This assumption ensures that
the model is stationary: in the long run, debt returns to its steady state level following a
shock. The shock to borrowing costs εr,t is assumed to follow an AR(1) with autocorrelation
coefficient ρr .
We incorporate nonzero initial taxes. The economy is initially at a steady state with
constant positive value added, payroll, capital and labor income taxes. The revenues from
these taxes are rebated to households in the form of a lump-sum transfer/tax. We set all
other taxes to zero. The exchange rate is pegged at 1.
Parameter values The parameter values used in the simulation are listed in Table 1. The
time period is a quarter. Several parameters take values standard in the literature (see e.g.
Galí, 2008). Except when considering the flexible wage case, we follow Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Rebelo (2011) and set the wage stickiness parameter θw = 0.85 corresponding
roughly to a year and a half average duration of wages. The elasticity of substitution across

home varieties and across foreign varieties is assumed to be ρ = 4, a value near the middle
of a relatively wide range of estimates found in a large literature.37 For the elasticity of substitution across domestic and foreign varieties we assume a value of ζ = 1.2 to correspond
to the close to 1 value estimated in Feenstra, Obstfeld, and Russ (2010).
The tax rates are calibrated to the values for Spain in 2008 as reported in European
Commission (2011). The VAT rate, τ̄ v is set to 16% which is the ‘standard’ VAT rate.
The payroll tax, τ̄ p , is set at 18% and includes employers payroll taxes and social security
contributions. The capital tax, τ̄ R , is set to 18.3% to match the implicit tax rate on capital
and business income. The labor income tax rate, τ̄n , is set to 14% to match the implicit tax
rate on labor from personal income tax and employees social security contributions.
The parameters for the utility of real money balances are chosen to match the ratio of
M1 to nominal GDP for the Euro area (0.36) and to be consistent with the literature that
emphasizes a low semi-elasticity of real money balances to interest rates. The initial debt to
GDP is calibrated to match the net foreign asset to GDP of Spain of −75% in 2008. This
corresponds to a B = B ∗ = −0.87
Shock At time zero, the economy is in its non-stochastic steady state. At time one, agents
are hit by an unexpected shock to their cost of borrowing. Given ρr = 0.95 to match the
persistent effect of the shock, we calibrate εr to match the 4% decline in GDP in Spain
between 2008-2009. This corresponds to εr = 0.013.
37

For example, Broda and Weinstein (2006) define a product variety as the interaction of an HTS 10-digit
code and country and obtain a median elasticity estimate of 2.9 and a mean elasticity estimate of 8.2.

36

Results Figure 1 plots the impulse response of the economy to the interest rate shock for
three cases: flexible wages (F), sticky wages (S) and sticky wages with a 10% fiscal devaluation (FD). This magnitude of devaluation mimics closely the movement in consumption in
the flexible wage case.38 According to the formula in footnote 22, a 10% fiscal devaluation
translates into an increase in VAT of 7.6 percentage points (to 23.6%), a payroll tax cut of
10.7 percentage points (to 7.3%) and a capital tax cut of 10.8 percentage points (to 7.5%).
Note that the initial non-stochastic steady state is identical across all cases. All reported
variables are in percent deviation from their steady state values.
The increase in interest rates makes borrowing costly and leads to a substitution away
from consumption to savings. Since Spain is a net debtor in the initial steady state the
increase in interest rates has a negative income effect that reinforces the substitution effect
and further reduces consumption. The increase in interest rates leads to an increase in the
required rate of return on capital (consistent with the no-arbitrage condition between saving
in foreign bonds and in capital) and a decline in investment. The increase in savings and
decline in investment translates into an improvement in the trade balance. The extent of the
decline in consumption and investment and the impact on output and labor varies across
the three specifications and is tied to differential relative price movements.
In the case when wages are flexible (F), the decline in relative demand for home goods
(given home-bias) induces a decline in the demand for labor and capital services. At the
same time the decline in consumption, through the wealth effect, generates an increase in
labor supply for given real wages. The combined effect is a decline in real wages (5%) and
a decline in wages relative to rental rates of capital. In our calibration the net effect is an
increase in labor employment and an increase in output of 2.5%. The decline in relative
demand for home goods is associated with a sharp terms of trade depreciation of close to
10%, consistent with the decline in wages and rental rates of capital.
When wages are sticky (S), the relative price movements are distorted because of the slow
downward adjustment in wages as seen in Figure 1. The price of home goods declines by a
small amount and the terms of trade therefore depreciates by a little over 1% as compared to
the 10% depreciation in the flexible price case. Since the terms-of-trade is over-appreciated
relative to the flexible wage case the demand for domestic goods is too low. Similarly, real
wages decline gradually and the ratio of wages to the rental rate of capital increases in the
short-run, as opposed to decreasing as in the flexible price case. The combined effect is a
38

A one-time devaluation (nominal or fiscal) does not perfectly replicate the flexible-wage equilibrium due
to the dynamics associated with adjustment in capital. Note that, as is well known, in the presence of
mark-ups and distortionary taxes, the flexible price equilibrium is not first best. Welfare under an exchange
rate devaluation can therefore be higher than in the flexible price allocation.

4.5% drop in labor, a 4% decline in output and a decline in the employment of labor relative

quantitatively from the flexible price case.39
The impulse responses in the sticky wage case line up qualitatively quite well with what
was observed in Spain following the crisis. The decline in output, consumption, labor,
investment and the improvement in the trade balance accord well with the facts for Spain.
The model generated decline in consumption is 3.8% , while in the data it is 4.9% between
39

It is useful to compare the sticky wage outcome to papers that have used interest rate shocks but with
flexible prices. For instance, Neumeyer and Perri (2005) highlight the importance of attenuating wealth
effects on labor supply to generate a negative comovement between interest rates and output. Further,
they require working capital to generate the required correlation. As is evident here, with pricing power
and wage rigidity, even without working capital and with preferences that allow for wealth effects on labor
supply interest rate shocks can generate negative co-movement. An important difference is that wage rigidity
generates inefficient relative price movements in the hiring of labor versus capital.

2008–09. The trade balance as a ratio of GDP improves by 3.6% in the model generated data,
while empirically the improvement was 4.1%. The model generates a decline in investment
of 43% which is larger than in the data, where investment declined by 30% from its peak in
2007 to 2010.
The FD case is where under sticky wages, in the period when the interest rate shock hits,
the country implements a one-time (unexpected) permanent 10% fiscal devaluation (FD).
This intervention targets both the too-high real wage and the under-depreciated terms of
trade. The devaluation raises the domestic price of imported goods and reduces the foreign
price of exported goods, thus generating a larger depreciation of the terms of trade (8%)
than the case without the intervention (1.5%). The associated increase in the home price
level also brings about the relevant decline in real wages, close to the level in the flexible
price case. While this one-time exchange rate intervention cannot replicate the flexible price
allocations perfectly, it does quite well, as seen in the figures. The decline in consumption,
investment, improvement in the trade balance to GDP, and the increase in labor, output
and the ratio of employment to capital are quite close to the flexible price case.
Lastly, we evaluate the welfare impact of a 10% devaluation (FD) relative to the case
without the fiscal devaluation (S). We perform a calculation à la Lucas (1987). That is
we compute the permanent per-period decline in consumption in the non-stochastic steady
state required to match the welfare following the interest rate shock, with and without the
fiscal devaluation. As is well known, in standard business cycle models the level effects are
quite small. The relevant number is therefore the comparison across the different cases.
The certainty equivalent consumption decline in the case of FD is 0.45%. Without the FD
intervention the certainty equivalent consumption decline is around 50% higher, at 0.64%. A

second measure is to restrict the consumption decline to a shorter time interval (as opposed to
a permanent decline). When restricted to 10 quarters, the constant per-period consumption
decline (relative to the initial steady state) is 2.55%. Without the fiscal devaluation, it is
again around 50% higher, at 3.65%. These numbers are reported in the first two rows of
Table 2.
Alternatives We now evaluate the impact of certain deviations from the full fiscal devaluation just described. The results are reported in Figure 2 and Table 2. The line FDK̃ refers
to the case when the fiscal devaluation does not include the capital tax adjustment. That is,
the fiscal intervention takes the form of an increase in VAT and cut in payroll taxes, but no
cut in capital taxes. The line FDA refers to the case of the full fiscal devaluation but when it
is announced one quarter in advance. Both these cases, as we know from the theoretical discussion, break the equivalence with the (unanticipated) nominal devaluation. In the case of
FDK̃ , employment decisions are distorted towards labor and away from capital. The extent
of this distortion is increasing in the share of capital in production, all else equal. The ratio

of employment to capital therefore rises more than in the case of FD. The decline in returns
to investing generates a larger drop in investment and a larger improvement in the trade
balance. In the case FDA when the fiscal intervention is anticipated, the anticipated future
decline in real wages generates a decline in labor employment and output in the quarter
before the implementation of the fiscal devaluation. There is quick convergence to the case
of an unexpected FD in the following periods.
Lastly, the FDM̃ line represents the case when we exclude the seignorage revenues associated with a fiscal devaluation from the country budget constraint to capture the case of
a fiscal devaluation in a currency union without the transfer of seigniorage from the union
central bank to the devaluing country (see discussion in Section 4.1). Recall that this is a
policy that can be implemented unilaterally by the country. When calibrated to match the
ratio of M1 to nominal GDP for the Euro Area, the impact from the missing seigniorage
transfers is negligible. One way to see this is that the present discounted value of seignorage
associated with the fiscal devaluation is about 2% of steady state net foreign assets. Reversing the impact of the seignorage will be equivalent to a 2% decline in net foreign assets
for Spain alongside the interest rate increase. This has a negligible effect on all variables as
depicted in Figure 2. The path of the variables for the case of FDM̃ is indistinguishable from
that for FD, the full fiscal devaluation.
The welfare implications of incomplete FD are reported in Table 2. Even when the fiscal
devaluation is imperfect it significantly closes the gap between the no intervention and the
full implementation welfare. In the case when only a VAT-payroll tax swap is used without
any adjustment for capital taxes the gap is closed by 68%. In the case when the fiscal
devaluation is anticipated it is closed by 79%. In the case when the devaluation is halved in
size, to 5%, it still covers 53% of the welfare gap.
41

In September 2012 Spain raised the standard VAT from 18% to 21% and for several lower
tax bracket items the tax increases were even bigger, for instance, the taxes on schoolbooks
rose from 4% to 21%, for haircuts, cinema tickets and other entertainment items from 8%
to 21%. This VAT increase was not accompanied with payroll and capital tax cuts as would
be called for in a fiscal devaluation. When we simulate the impact of a 5% VAT tax increase
alongside the interest rate increase, without any other tax changes, welfare is estimated to
decline by more than the case without any intervention. In the absence of intervention welfare
declines by −0.64%. The VAT tax increase instead reduces it by −0.88%, emphasizing the
essential role of a payroll tax cut alongside the VAT increase to capture the benefits of a
devaluation.
The welfare gap between no intervention and a fiscal devaluation (even if imperfect) grows
with the degree of wage rigidity. In Figure 3 we plot the certainty equivalent consumption
decline (permanent) under four alternative policy regimes as a function of the wage rigidity
parameter θw . As is to be expected, the higher the wage rigidity the more beneficial the
fiscal devaluation, either full or incomplete, relative to no-intervention.

Conclusion

In this paper we propose two types of fiscal policies that can robustly implement allocations
stemming from a nominal devaluation, but in an economy with a fixed exchange rate. Our
proposed fiscal devaluations have a number of appealing features. First, they can be implemented unilaterally by one country using a small set of conventional fiscal instruments. In
particular, a one-time unanticipated fiscal devaluation can be implemented adjusting solely
the value-added and payroll taxes. Second, they are robust in the sense that they work
across a number of economic environments and require virtually no information about the
details of the microeconomic environment, in particular about the extent and nature of nominal price and wage rigidity. Third, they are government revenue neutral. Clearly, there are
political economy constraints to the size of a feasible fiscal devaluation including tax evasion
considerations. An area that we leave for future research is the impact of these factors on
implementation. Nevertheless, our results suggest that fiscal devaluations offer a partial but
attractive relaxation of Mundell’s impossible trinity, allowing for essentially the same outcomes as under an active monetary policy while maintaining a fixed exchange rate and free
capital flows.

Substitute labor demand into the utility and the budget constraint, and denote by µht a Lagrange
multiplier on the budget constraint. Note that there exists a separate budget constraint for each
state of the world at each date. The description of the state of the world includes whether the
h ≡
household resets its wage rate.40 The first order condition with respect to Cth results in UCt

If households can perfectly share risk domestically, they equalized consumption across states when they
do and do not adjust their wage rates (which under Calvo assumption constitutes idiosyncratic risk). This
implies that Θht+1 and µht+1 do not depend on whether the household adjusts its wage, and furthermore
index h can be dropped altogether in this case. We adopt this assumption for simplicity in the main text,
but it is without loss of generality for our results.

A.2

Proof of Proposition 1 (Complete markets)

Conjecture that {Ct , Ct∗ } and the path of relative prices and wages is unchanged. Then from good
demand (1), goods-market clearing (9), production functions (8) and labor demand (18), it follows
that the rest of the equilibrium allocation is unchanged. In particular consumption and output of
individual varieties as well as labor input of individual households are unchanged. We now verify
the above conjecture by exploring the equilibrium conditions for price and wage settings, as well as
for aggregate consumption.
First, substitute the expression for stochastic discount factor (3) into the wage-setting equation (19). Given the rest of the allocation, the same path of {W̄t (h)} satisfies this condition when
1 + ςtc
≡1
1 + τtn

ςtc ≡ τtn .

⇔

(A.1)

Second, consider price setting by home firms for the home market as given by equations (13) under
PCP and by (14) under LCP, again after substituting in (3). Given the rest of the allocation, the
same path of reset prices {P̄Ht (i)} satisfies these conditions when:41
(1 + ςtc )(1 − τtv )
(1 + ςtc )(1 − ςtp )
≡
≡ 1.
1 + τtd
1 + τtd

(A.2)

Third, consider international price setting by home firms in the foreign market described by the law
∗ (i)}
of one price (12) under PCP and by equation (15) under LCP respectively. In both cases, {P̄Ht
stays unchanged provided that:42

Fourth, consider international price setting by foreign firms in the home market described by the
law of one price (16) under PCP and by (17) under LCP. The same path of {P̄F t (i)} satisfies these
conditions when
1 + τtm
1 + τtm
Et0

⇔

Now by examining the two fiscal devaluation policies (FD0 ) and (FD00 ) we conclude that all
conditions (A.1)–(A.4) are satisfied in both cases, and therefore (given the conjecture we started
out with) both fiscal devaluations result in the same nominal reset wages and prices as a nominal
devaluation. Given motion equations for prices and wage dynamics (e.g., (11)) and the definitions
of price indexes (e.g., (2)), this implies that all nominal wages and prices (including price indexes)
41

For exact equivalence of reset prices under a fiscal devaluation, the terms in the square brackets in both the
numerator and denominator should be identically unity state-by-state and period-by-period, as required by
condition (A.2).
42
This requirement immediately follows from (12) under PCP, but (15) under LCP instead requires

are mimicked under both fiscal devaluation policies. This, in turn, implies in view of (A.3)–(A.4)
that the terms of trade defined in (24) are also mimicked. To additionally mimic the behavior of the
real exchange rate in (26), we need to require Et0 (1 + ςtc ) ≡ Et , which together with (A.1) results in:
ςtc ≡ τtn ≡ δt ,

(A.5)

also satisfied by (FD0 ) and (FD00 ).
We finally verify that the equilibrium values of {Ct , Ct∗ } associated with a nominal devaluation
are also equilibrium values under our fiscal devaluation policies. Under complete markets, the
international risk-sharing condition (25) becomes the familiar Backus-Smith condition (28), where
the constant of proportionality λ is recovered from the intertemporal budget constraint of the
country and stays unchanged across nominal and fiscal devaluations provided that relative prices and
terms of trade follow the same path.43 As long as we have equivalence in all relative prices, including
the real exchange rate, from (28) we obtain equivalence in the relative consumption allocation. The
levels of consumption must also be equivalent under nominal and fiscal devaluations to satisfy the
aggregate resource constraint (aggregating (9)).
This completes the loop and verifies that the conjecture we started out with is internally consistent. That is, the equilibrium allocations of consumption, labor and output associated with a
nominal devaluation and both fiscal devaluations in (FD0 ) and (FD00 ) coincide.
Finally, under separable utility in money balances, money demand (5) is a side equation, and
hence imposes no additional constraints on implementation.44 Switching from nominal to fiscal
devaluation in general changes the path of the (shadow) nominal interest rate, and hence requires
an adjustment in money supply in order to satisfy the altered money demand. The required path of
the money supply under a fiscal devaluation policy {Mt0 } can be recovered directly from (5) given
the rest of the allocation. 

A.3

Fiscal devaluations in financial autarky

We provide a brief discussion of the case of financial autarky (closed capital account), where the
set of risk sharing conditions (25) becomes empty (Ωt ≡ ∅), and the flow budget constraint (23)
becomes a balanced trade requirement:

44
Separability of real money balances in the utility function is a standard assumption in the literature and
implies that holdings of real money balances have no affect on the marginal utility of consumption. Hence
our equivalence results do not require replicating the equilibrium path of real money balances. If on the
other hand we had non-separable utility, equivalence would require the use of an additional tax on money
holdings in order to reduce money demand under a fiscal devaluation. This is because expected nominal
devaluations result in an increased nominal interest rate and depressed money demand. Replicating an
unexpected devaluation, however, does not require an extra instrument even under non-separable utility.

46

∗ and C . As a result, the real exchange
where we used demand conditions (1) to substitute in for CHt

rate plays no role for the allocation as it shows up in no equilibrium condition, and therefore only
conditions (A.1)–(A.4) are needed to be satisfied by fiscal devaluation policies.45 Note that the
reduced fiscal devaluation policies (FD0R ) and (FD00R ) of Proposition 3 satisfy these requirements,
but under autarky we need not require that the devaluation is unanticipated.

A.4

Proof of Proposition 3 (Unanticipated devaluations)

Following the steps of the proof of Proposition 1 (in Appendix A.2), the conditions to mimic the
path of wages and prices instead of (A.1)–(A.4) become simply:
1 + ςtc
≡1
1 + τtn

and

1 + ςtx
1 + τtm
≡
≡ 1 + δt ,
v
1 − τt
1 − τtv

(A.6)

which are satisfied under both reduced devaluation policies (FD0R ) and (FD00R ). These conditions
do not impose a requirement on the use of profit tax τtd , because under a one-time unexpected
devaluation policy it no longer affects price setting in (13)–(15). Indeed, for price setting before
t = 0, no nominal or fiscal policy change is anticipated, so it does not affect price setting; for t ≥ 0,
the change in either nominal or fiscal regime happens once and for all, and hence all taxes can be
moved outside the expectation in (13)–(15) and canceled out (also see the expression in footnote 41).
We still need to use profit tax τtd if domestic equity is traded internationally in order to replicate
the effects on the budget constraint (23) and international risk sharing (25), as shown in Lemma 1.
In particular, the path of Dthe∗ = Πt /[(1 + τtd )Et ] must be replicated under a fiscal devaluation,
which from the equation for profits (10) requires τtd ≡ δ for t ≥ 0 under (FD0R ) and τtd ≡ 0 under
(FD00R ). Whenever a home-currency debt is traded, a partial default (haircut) τ0h = δ/(1 + δ) is
needed in the event (state-period) of a fiscal devaluation in order to replicate the valuation effects
in the country budget constraint (23).
Since devaluation is one-time unanticipated, the path of the home nominal risk-free interest rate
is unaffected (and in fact, UIP holds in this case as interest parity, it+1 = i∗t+1 , in every period), and
therefore money demand in (5) is not affected. As a result, with ςtc = 0, the same money supply as
under a nominal devaluation would also support the fiscal devaluation (Mt0 = Mt ), and hence real
balances are also unchanged.
Finally, with ςtc = 0, the path of the real exchange rate is not exactly mimicked relative to a
nominal devaluation, however this does not affect the international risk sharing conditions (25).
This is because for t < 0 no policy change is anticipated (zero-probability event), and for t ≥ 0 the
policy change is once and for all, therefore leaving saving and portfolio choice decisions unaffected
before, after and at t = 0. Consequently, the same consumption allocation {Ct , Ct∗ } satisfies both
the country budget constraint (23) and the international risk sharing conditions (25) under both
reduced fiscal devaluation policies (FD0R ) and (FD00R ) as under a nominal devaluation. 

Part (i) follows immediately from (30) after substituting in t = δtm under (FD0 ) and t = δtv
under (FD00 ). To prove Part (ii), note that under both (FD0R ) and (FD00R ) we can rewrite

Note that the domestic Euler equations (4) now become side equations and determine the intertemporal

nominal and a fiscal devaluation in this case.

47

where the first term is trade deficit (−N Xt ) and the second term is profits without taking into
account VAT and payroll subsidy (i.e., Π/(1 − τtv ), since τtv = ςtp under fiscal devaluations). We can
divide and multiple the second term by the dividend tax (1 + τtd ) to obtain:
Pt Ct − Wt Nt = −N Xt + (1 + δt )

Πt
,
1 + τtd

(A.7)

since under both (FD0R ) and (FD00R ) we have (1 + τtd )/(1 − τtv ) ≡ 1 + δt . Finally, substituting (A.7)
this resulting equation into (30), and imposing t = 0 and δtm = δt or δtv = δt under the two reduced
fiscal devaluations respectively, we obtain (31). 
We now prove an additional result that under one-time unanticipated fiscal devaluations the net
present value of additional government revenues is non-negative when the stock market capitalization
(plus the value of unincorporated business) exceeds the net foreign liabilities of a country:
Lemma A.1 Under (FD0R ) and (FD00R ), the net present value of the additional government revenues
equals δ times the sum of net foreign assets and the capitalization of the business sector of the home
country at the time of the devaluation.

We adopt a formalization where firms rent the services from labor and capital on centralized markets,
at prices Wt and Rt , and capital is accumulated by households according to

On the production side we assume that each firm operates a neoclassical production function,
which for concreteness takes a Cobb-Douglas form:
Yt (i) = At Zt (i)Nt (i)α Kt (i)1−α ,
where Kt (i) is the firm’s capital input. Profits are given by:
Πit = (1 − τtv )PHt (i)Yt (i) − (1 − ςtp )Wt Nt (i) − (1 − ςtR )Rt Kt (i),
where ςtR is the capital subsidy. The pricing equations are symmetric to the ones previously described
with the difference that marginal cost is now equal to

instead of (1 − ςsp )Ws /[αAs Zs (i)Ns (i)α−1 ], and hence price setting imposes exactly the same requirements on fiscal devaluation policies as in the economy without capital.
In addition, the firm’s optimal mix of labor and capital use is given by:
Nt

Kt

which is the special case of the equation in the text under the Cobb-Douglas production function.
A fiscal {δt }-devaluation in this economy can be engineered exactly as in Proposition 1, Lemma 1
and Proposition 2 supplemented with the following tax adjustments. For (FD0 ) an investment
subsidy and a tax on capital income ςtI = τtK = ςtc = δt are needed. For (FD00 ), a subsidy on
the rental rate of capital ςtR = ςtp = δt / (1 + δt ) is also needed. In the case where the fiscal
devaluation is one-time unanticipated, exactly as in Proposition 3, one can dispense with the use
of the consumption subsidy and income tax, as well as with the use of the investment subsidy and
the tax on capital income (ςtc = τtn = ςtI = τtK = 0 for all t ≥ 0).

Asymmetric tax pass-through

We specialize right away to the case of a one-time unanticipated devaluation and the VAT-based
policy, that is we set τtm = ςtx = ςtc = τtn = τtd = 0 and only allow for non-zero τtv and ςtp .
In case of partial indexation to tax changes defined in (32), the price setting problem of the firm
under PCP becomes:

As discussed in the text, exact fiscal implementation is impossibly with asymmetric passthrough, and therefore we focus on the first-order accurate implementation by which we ensure
that the first-order dynamics of all aggregate prices, in particular PHt , is unchanged under a nominal and a fiscal devaluation.47 To this end, we log linearize the price setting and the price index

c s = log[ρ/(ρ − 1)] + ws − log α − as + (1 − α)ns
is the average marginal cost in the cross-section of firms (averaging out idiosyncratic productivity

Following the conventional steps in the New Keynesian literature (see Galí, 2008), we can solve
this system to obtain a dynamic equation for aggregate price index (an analog to the New Keynesian

In fact, one could mimic price indexes exactly, but not the whole distribution of individual prices. The
policy that exactly replicates the aggregate prices is, however, non-analytic and solves a dynamic non-linear
difference equation.

where λ = (1 − θp )(1 − βθp )/θp . Under a fiscal devaluation, the dynamics of both pHt and mc

replicates those under a nominal devaluation, which satisfy (A.8) with all taxes set to zero. This

where we have dropped the expectation as we are looking for a non-stochastic implementation of a
one-time fiscal devaluation for t ≥ 0.
In this PCP economy, the law of one price equations (12)–(16) are satisfied, and therefore a
VAT-based fiscal devaluation policy requires τtv = δ/(1 + δ), or equivalently τ̂tv = log(1 + δ) ≡ δ̂, for
t ≥ 0. This implies that ∆τ̂tv = 0 for t ≥ 1 and ∆τ̂0v = δ̂. Combining this information with (A.9),

where Lˆ
ςtp = ςˆt−1
is the lag operator, and 0 < ρ1 < 1 < ρ2 are the two roots of x2 − (1 + β +
λ/ξp )x − β = 0. Inverting the first bracket with the lead operator, we arrive at:

which, taking into account the initial condition, has the solution:
ςˆ0p − δ̂ = ρ−1

and

ςˆtp − δ̂ = ρ−t

This can be simplified to:

Finally, note that ρ = ρ−1

Exponentiating this solution results in the expression in Propostion 8.

and therefore also terms of trade. Given prices, the rest of the allocation is unchanged provided that
the relative consumption is the same, which is ensured by the unchanged country budget constraint
and risk-sharing condition.

These calculations are done under the assumption ξp > 0. In the case of ξp = 0, the solution to (A.9) is

immediately characterized by ςˆtp = δ̂ for t > 0 and ςˆ0p = δ̂ 1 + λ/ξv .
