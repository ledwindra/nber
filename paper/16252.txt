The Trend of BMI Values of US Adults by Centiles, birth cohorts 1882-1986

ABSTRACT
Trends in BMI values are estimated by centiles of the US adult population by birth cohorts 1886-1986
stratified by ethnicity. The highest centile increased by some 18 to 22 units in the course of the century
while the lowest ones increased by merely 1 to 3 units. Hence, the BMI distribution became increasingly
right skewed as the distance between the centiles became increasingly larger. The rate of change of
BMI centile curves varied considerably over time. The BMI of white men and women experienced
upsurges after the two World Wars and downswings during the Great Depression and again after 1970.
However, among blacks the pattern is different during the first half of the century with men’s rate
of increase in BMI values decreasing substantially and that of females remaining unchanged at a relatively
high level until the Second World War. However, after the war the rate of change of BMI values of
blacks resembled that of the whites with an accelerating phase followed by a slow down around the
1970s. In sum, the creeping nature of the obesity epidemic is evident, as the technological and lifestyle
changes of the 20th century affected various segments of the population quite differently.

The Trend of BMI Values of US Adults by Centiles, birth cohorts 1882-1986

Keywords: BMI, US, NHANES, obesity, overweight, semiparametric modelling,
gamlss model, percentile estimation

Introduction
Komlos and Brabec (2010) recently estimated the trend in the mean BMI values of US-born
adults by birth cohorts to find that they have been increasing continuously throughout the 20th
century. This “creeping” nature of the trend is quite contrary to the received wisdom which
tends to place the onset of the obesity epidemic in the final quarter of the previous century.
However, they also found that the rate of increase in BMI values varied quite a bit with two
periods of particularly rapid acceleration in BMI values following the two World Wars.
Insofar as they have discussed in that paper the advantages and disadvantages of the birthcohort approach as opposed to the period effects that has been the overwhelming focus of
research up to now, we shall not reiterate the issues here. The current aim is to expand those
results which explored exclusively the mean BMI values by estimating trends by centiles for
four categories of adults, for whites and blacks by gender using the same NHANES data sets
collected between 1959 and 2006.
Method
For modeling the BMI distribution and its dependence on several covariates, we use
the approach based on the generalized additive model for location, scale, and shape
(GAMLSS), developed by Rigby and Stasinopoulos (2005, 2006, 2007). In principle, this can
be seen as a generalization of the generalized linear model (GLM) (McCullagh, Nelder 1989),
as well as of the generalized additive model (GAM) (Hastie, Tibshirani 1990), or even of the
LMS1 approach (Cole 1988). The advantage of GAMLSS is that it enables one to fit not only
the mean of the distribution as a function of the covariates, as is usual in linear, nonlinear, or
nonparametric regression, but also other characteristics. Similarly as in GAM, variability can
1

be modeled in detail, as well. Yet, in GAMLSS, the modeling is more flexible as it allows
other moments (i.e., skewness and kurtosis) to change with the covariates. This is necessary if
one is interested in realistic and flexible description of the whole BMI distribution and its
changes with several explanatory variables. The distribution itself can be characterized by
centiles and their changes over the range of the selected covariates. Because this is precisely
our aim, we need to allow for departures from normality and for estimation of several
characteristics of the distribution simultaneously: i.e., mean, variability, skewness and
kurtosis.
In particular, after some experimentation, we model the BMI distribution using the BoxCox t family, BCT(  ,  , , ) (Rigby and Stasinopoulos 2006). This is a parametric but very
flexible family of distributions having parameters  ,  , , . Variable Y with positive (  )
support2 has the BCT(  ,  , , ) distribution if the transformed variable Z has the following
form:


1  Y 
Z
   1, if   0
   

Y 
1
if   0
 log ,



(1)

Z is a truncated standard t distribution with  degrees of freedom (where   0 does not need
to be an integer). Truncation at zero is induced by the positivity of Y . In our case of BMI, the
amount of truncation is very small. As shown in Rigby and Stasinopoulos (2006), under such
circumstances,  can be interpreted approximately as the median of Y ,  as the
interquartile-range-based coefficient of variation as a measure of relative variability,3 
controls skewness, and  controls kurtosis, or just how heavy the tails of Y are.
Our model allows the BCT(  ,  , , )’s parameters to change with the covariates in a
flexible, nonparametric way. Specifically, we use the cubic spline family (Eubank 1988,
Green and Silverman 1994, Rigby and Stasinopoulos 2007) to model dependence of
2

 , , and  on covariates. In other words, we model the link-transformed4 parameter as
cubic splines in continuous variables plus effects of factors in the ANOVA style (Graybill
1976, Rawlings 1988) for discrete variable coding the education level of a particular person.
We use identity link for  , and log link for  , parameters. In other words, we model

 , , log   and log  by cubic splines. We also assume independence among individual
responses. Strictly speaking, this is not reflecting the clustering induced by the survey
sampling design used in NHANES data, but we use this as a reasonable approximation. We
considered the extent to which adding the random primary sampling unit effect affects the
model – and found that it did not change the estimates substantially.
Thus, our model is described by the following equations:
BMI i ~ BCT  i ,  i , i , i 

i = cs   Agei ,4 + cs  Birth _ yri ,5 + cs  PIRi ,2 +  αm I Ei  m

 i = cs  Age i ,1 + cs Birth _ yri ,1 + cs PIRi ,1 +  αm I Ei  m 
m=1

log i  = cs PIRi ,1 ,

where I . is the indicator function which equals 1 if the condition in its argument is true, and
0 otherwise. E i is the level of education of the subject. cs  x, d  is the cubic spline in a
variable x with d degrees of freedom.5 BMI i is the BMI for the i -th person. Similarly, Age i
is the age in years, Birth _ yri is the birth year, PIRi is the Poverty Income Ratio for the i -th
person.

 , , , change from individual to individual, but only through changes in various
covariates. Unlike the others,  changes only with a single covariate, PIR. Nevertheless, both

3

spline parts involved in i , i , i , i as well as in the educational effects αm , αm , αm , m  1,2,3
are (simultaneously) estimated via the Rigby, Stasinopoulos 2005) algorithm from the data. In
particular, they are not assumed a priori as they would be if, for example, one would assume
normality.
The degrees of freedom for splines in various variables are very important in that they
control the smoothness of the fit. Therefore, they ought not be set arbitrarily. Instead, they
were selected using GAIC, or generalized Akaike information criterion (Rigby and
Stasinopoulos 2005). Only integer values of the degrees of freedom were considered in the
search. Compared to the model of Komlos and Brabec (2010), model (2) allows different
smoothness in different variables as well as different smoothness in the same explanatory
variables for different characteristics e.g. cs   Age i ,4 and cs  Age i ,1 ). Note that generally,
for more complicated characteristics (from  to  ), the curves are less complex (basically
smoother), as expected.
We show the results of the weighted analyses (weighting by reciprocal variances). Shape
of the centile curves does not change substantially if we recompute the model in unweighted
fashion, however. We do the computations using the gamlss package (Rigby, Stasinopoulos
2007) from the “R” software environment (R 2010), together with some additional code
written by us.6 Those individuals with missing values of either BMI and/or any of the
explanatory variables were excluded from the estimation. We explored the model fit by means
of centile residuals considering various plots, similar to those used in standard regression, e.g.
residuals vs. fitted, Q-Q plots, histograms of residuals, and also at worm plots (van Buuren
and Fredriks 2001).
Results
That the persistent increase in BMI values began already among the birth cohorts of
the late 19th century is confirmed by these estimates in all four groups (Figures 1-4). There are

4

a number of similarities and differences in the experience of the four groups under
consideration. In all four groups the shapes traced out by the BMI centiles can be
characterized as having a shape of a half-fan in the sense that the upper centiles move up as
the ridges of a fan while the lower ones remained essentially unchanged. Consider that the
highest centiles increased by some 20, 20, 18, and 22 units (WM, WF, BM, BF) during the
period under consideration while the lowest ones increased by merely 3, 1.5, 1, and 2 units.
This is an indication that the distribution did not shift outward uniformly. Its shape has been
deformed considerably and continuously so that it became increasingly skewed to the right.
Figures 1-4 about here
Another way of describing this pattern is to consider the variation across the centiles.
These also indicate that the variance increased continuously as the centiles rotated upward
(Figure 5). Obviously, the increase in variance is accompanied by a substantial skewing of the
distribution toward the more obese range, rather than by a uniform increase in the whole BMI
spectrum. One can also consider, moreover, the dates at which various centiles of a birth
cohort which reached 30 BMI units, the conventional definition of obesity, as a measure of
this upward rotation (Table 1 and Figure 6). The rate of rotation was rather similar among
white males and females, and black males. Among men it took on average about 19 years for
an additional centile to reach a BMI value of 30 while among white and black women it took
17 years and 13 years respectively. The black females were often 30-40 years ahead of the
other three groups in reaching the level of obesity in a particular centile.

Rate of change of the centile curves
The rate of change of BMI centile curves were obtained by numerical differentiation of the
centile functions estimated by model (2) with respect to the date of birth. These varied
substantially over time in all the four groups under study (Figures 7-10). Initially, the rate of
change was lowest among white men born in the 19th century and remained constant until the
5

turn of the 20th century. This was followed by a rapid acceleration in BMI values around
World War I. The acceleration was accompanied by a marked divergence among the centiles
(leading to increased BMI variability), particularly in the upper ones, a divergence that
continued during the remainder of the century (leading to increased skewness to the right of
the BMI distribution). However, the rate of change peaked in the mid-1920s and decelerated
during the Great Depression, reaching a nadir during the Second World War (Figure 7).
During the war the rate of change among white men was still positive in most of the centiles,
though at the lower centiles the rate dipped below that experienced in the late 19th century.
However, in the upper centiles the rate was well above those of the 19th century even during
the war. Another turning point was reached in the early 1950s as BMI values accelerated once
again similarly to the pattern obtained after the First World War. Yet, the second upswing of
acceleration in the lower centiles was both considerably shallower than the first one and
reached a plateau quickly in the 1950s. By the birth cohorts of the early 1960s the rate of
change of BMI values was constant or even negative among the lower centiles. Only in the
higher centiles did the acceleration persist until the present day and pass the previous peak
rate reached in the mid 1920s (Figure 7).
Figure 7 about here
In many respects the rate of change of white female BMI values has a similar pattern
to that of white men (Figure 8). It remained fairly constant in the 19th century; it also
accelerated around the two World Wars. However, the World War I acceleration lasted
longer: the peak rate in the top centiles was reached in the mid-1930s instead of the mid1920s as among their male counterparts. Moreover, the deceleration of the Great Depression
was shallower and also lasted longer, - until the very end of the war. The subsequent
acceleration also began at mid-century, as among men, and lasted until about 1970 at which
time the rate of change either remained constant or declined somewhat particularly in the
lower centiles. A similar flattening of the curves at least in the lower centiles among men
6

occurred in the mid 1970s. In short, the salient pattern is similar among white men and
women. The main difference is in the lengths and turning points of the cycles.
Figure 8 about here
In contrast, among blacks the pattern is quite different from that of whites in the preWorld War II era but becomes quite similar after mid-century. Among black men (Figure 9),
the rate of change began at a higher level but declined practically continuously until World
War II. The inter-centile range was as large as among the white women to begin with, but did
not increase at all until after World War II. Furthermore, in contrast to that experienced by
whites, the World War I upswing was inconsequential and meant only a short interruption of
the persistent decline in the rate of change. Moreover, the post-World War II upswing began
earlier than among whites, i.e., in the early 1940s, and lasted until the mid-1960s, when a
decline set in, somewhat earlier than that among white women.
Figure 9 about here
The pattern among black women (Figure 10) was equally unique in the first half of the
century insofar as the rate of change was high already to begin with and continued almost
uninterrupted at that high level until mid century. The range between the lowest and highest
centile was large at the beginning and, as among black men, did not widen at all in the first
half of the century, contrary to the pattern among the whites. The post-World War II upswing
started around 1960 among the highest centile women, but was a bit delayed among the
lowest centiles. The peak rate of change was reached around 1969 among the highest centile
black women, in 1971 among white women and in 1960 among black men. The highest
centile white men did not have a local maximum during the post-World War II era as rates
continued to rise until the end of the period.

Confidence Intervals

7

The 95% confidence intervals were obtained for a given percentile curve as envelope
bands, based on 500 bootstraps from a simplified model, without weighing.7 They are often
asymmetric (Figure 11) - but the degree of asymmetry varies across the different centiles.
This reflects the amount of information that is contained in the data for the estimation of a
given centile. When we are estimating a central centile (i.e. that close to the 50th) the the data
are close to being symmetric, and hence the CI is more symmetric as well (unless there is
strong asymmetry in the BMI distribution itself). More extreme centiles are restricted by the
data much more asymmetrically and hence, for them we can typically observe very
asymmetric CI’s.

Conclusion
We estimate the trends by centiles as well as the rate of change of the trends in BMI
values of US adults by birth cohorts stratified into four groups: white men, white women,
black men and black women between c. 1896 and 1986. We find that the BMI values were
increasing as far back as our data allow us to go, namely, the late 19th century. Moreover, the
centiles shifted outward like the veins of a fan implying that the distribution became
increasingly skewed to the right over time. The BMI values in the lowest centiles hardly
increased at all. Even among black women, who were the most susceptible to the obesity
epidemic, the lowest centile increased only 2 units during the whole period under
consideration. However, the highest centiles increased by as much as 18-22 units in the four
groups considered. After World War II the low centile BMI values were either stagnant or
practically so and the only BMI values that increased rapidly were in the upper centiles.
Consequently, the spread between the lowest and highest centiles practically tripled from
approximately 8 to 25 BMI units in three of the groups while among black women the spread
increased from 10 to 30 BMI units in the course of the period considered (Figures 1-4).

8

There was considerable variation over time in the rate of change of BMI centile
curves. Among whites, both men and women, BMI values accelerated around the birth
cohorts of the two World Wars and decelerated among those of the Great Depression. The
rate of change differed markedly among blacks and whites in the first half of the century but
became quite similar after mid-century. Among black men the rate of change slowed during
the first half of the century and then accelerated after World War II, while among black
women it remained constant at a high level until World War II when it accelerated as in the
other groups. After the war the rate of change in BMI values of blacks came to resemble that
of whites with a post-war acceleration followed by a substantial deceleration around the late
1960s.
In sum, the obesity epidemic is hardly the making of the last few decades of the 20th
century as the conventional wisdom would have it. Our estimates indicate that the transition to
post-industrial BMI values occurred gradually in the course of the 20th century and probably
started much earlier than the consensus asserts, with black women outpacing the other three
groups from the very beginning. Thus, the transition to a post-industrial lifestyle over time
affected an increasing portion of the BMI distribution. Only the bottom two centiles managed
to stay below overweight status among white men, white women, and black men, and among
black women only the lowest centile escaped the grips of the creeping epidemic. This also
implies that lifestyle changes of the 20th century affected various segments of the population
quite differently and that 10-20% of the population was completely immune to it.
Identifying the causes of this long-run trend is outside of the scope of this study, but
we do note that the persistently “creeping” nature of the epidemic does suggest that its roots
were embedded deep in the social fabric, slowly changing as the population responded to a
vast array of seemingly irresistible socio-economic and technological forces. The question
still remains to explore why the various ethnic groups, genders and the different segments of

9

the BMI distribution responded so differently to these forces impinging on the life-style of the
population.

Support is the closure of set where the density of the random variable of interest is positive.
Sigma is related to the coefficient of variation, CV. Rigby and Stasinopoulos (2006) derive

the following approximate formula: CV ≈ σ[1 + 0.36/τ ]. Nevertheless, the coefficient of
variation is defined somewhat differently from what is used normally. Usually, one uses
CV 

std . deviation
. Here, one uses the so called centile-based coefficient of variation,

namely: CV 

, where IQR  Q3  Q1 , interquartile range is the difference between

third and first and quartiles of the distribution. One can consider it just another way of
computing CV as a measure of relative variability, in which the mean is replaced by median
and standard deviation by (appropriately scaled) interquartile range. The factor of ¾ comes
from the fact that under normality, one needs such scaling to have an unbiased estimate of the
standard deviation. In fact, under normality, to have unbiasedness,

As in the case of the generalized linear models (McCullagh, Nelder 1989), here we deal with

a model that is inherently nonlinear (in parameters). It is of relatively tame nonlinear class,
however. Specifically, the linear predictor (i.e. linear combination of covariates or
explanatory variables with unknown coefficients as parameters) does not model the  , , or

 directly. Instead, it models its one-to-one function. The function is called a link.
5

d’s were selected separately for each cubic spline term in the model (1), based on the GAIC

criterion described on the next page. Generally, the larger is the degree of freedom for a
spline, the less smooth and more complex the spline function is.
6

In particular, we do not use the centiles function built into the gamlss package, because we

have several covariates in the model.
7

CI's were estimated together over times and quantiles. To be preceise, we bootstrapped the

model (actually the simplified model without weighting but with the same covariate structure
19

for  , , , ) 500 times. Each resample out of these 500 gives model parameters that allow
for computation of all quantile curves for all times (and much more). Then we searched for
2.5 and 97.5 th percentiles over the 500 bootstrap resamples time point by time point, for
each percentile (10, 20, ..., 90). This gives a sort of "envelope" band that has the property that
it covers 95% percentile curves iver the bootstraps, for a given percentile.
