Some Aspects of the Canadian Experience
With Flexible Exchange Rates in the 1970s

AB STR.ACT

In this study, the authors examine three aspects of the Canadian experience
with flexible exchange rates in the 1970s: the movements in the Canadian dollar—
U.S. dollar exchange rate, the sharp growth of external borrowings by Canadians
in the 1974—76 period, and the real effects of relative price movements.
Several theoretical and empirical exchange rate models are found to have
done poorly in explaining the movements of the value of the Canadian dollar
over the decade.

In the examination of external borrowings in the mid—1970s, it is concluded
that there was some response in borrower and lender behaviour to movements in

nominal long—term interest rate differentials. Four sources of explanation for
such behaviour are examined.

A three—sector model comprising non—tradable goods, resource—based tradable
goods and non resource—based tradable goods, is used to study the effects of
changes in raw material prices, domestic unit labour costs, and the exchange rate
on various real variables in the Canadian economy.

INTRODUCTION

The Canadian economy during the 1970s provides a fascinating
study of how an economy responds to both real and nominal

shocksi under flexible exchange rates. Under the heading of
real shocks, one can categorize the sharp increase and almost as

decrease in the Canadian terms of trade and the divergence
of Canada's cyclical position vis—â--vis the United States. The
sharp

nominal shocks to the economy include the accelerating growth of
the money supply in the early 1970s which was followed by the
implementation in the latter half of 1975 of a policy of gradual
deceleration of monetary growth.

As a result of both real and monetary movements, the exchange
rate became progressively more overvalued (in purchasing—power—
parity terms) over the mid—l970s, reaching a peak in the fourth

quarter of 1976. This was followed by a depreciation of about 20
percent over the next two years, bringing the real exchange rate

at the end of 1978 back to its 1971 level. The shifts in the
terms of trade and the real exchange rate resulted in movements in
real variables such as the relative outputs of different kinds of

income distribution and the real balance of trade. The
response of interest rates to inflation and to the resulting
anti—inflationary monetary policy was one of the factors leading
to the sharp increase in Canadian external borrowing in 1975 and
goods,

Here, and throughout, the term "shock" is used in its
conventional economic sense as a shift in an exogenous
variable in the model under consideration.

1976, one of the most interesting episodes in the entire period.
In this paper we examine in detail certain aspects of the
response of the Canadian economy to real and financial shocks over

the 1970s. In each case we compare what theory tells us to
expect with the actual outcome, using relatively simple regression
equations to help us evaluate whether the data are consistent with

the theory. Perhaps it should he noted that we are not attempting
to account for everything that occurred in the Canadian economy in
the 1970s2 but rather, we are trying to see whether we can
explain some of the more significant movements of the economy at
that time with the intention of shedding some light on the
operation of the flexible exchange rate system.

One of the continuing themes in our investigation is that the
real world is very complex; a variety of shocks can occur at one
time, thereby making analysis of what is happening at any given

time difficult for the contemporary observer. Second, and
following from this point, the problem of interpreting the effects
of such shocks on the long—run value of the exchange rate has made

it very difficult to forecast the exchange rate. Both the
difficulty of interpreting shocks and the problem of forecasting
exchange rates increase the over—all range of uncertainty.
This can therefore result in behaviour that causes the adjustment
to both real and nominal shocks to be much slower than one might
have expected, with consequent real effects over the adjustment
period.

2.

To do this would require substantially larger and more
complicated empirical models than those we have used.

3

The structure of the paper is as follows. In Section 1 we
sketch out very briefly the salient characteristics of the

Canadian economy in the 1970s on which we wish to focus. Section
2 discusses the variety of exchange rate equations that have been
developed to explain the movements of the Canadian dollar over the
decade, and evaluates their ability to capture these movements.

this section we also examine the efficiency of the foreign
exchange market during this period. In Section 3 we analyze the
very sharp growth of external borrowing by Canadians in the
1974—76 period. Our attempt to explain this growth relies in part
upon the existence of irrationality in the formation of long—run
expectations in the bond market or exchange market or both.
Finally, in Section 4 we turn to an analysis of the real effects
resulting from the shocks to the system. In particular, we show
that fluctuations in relative outputs, income distribution and
trade balances can all be at least partly explained by relative
price changes arising from terms of trade and exchange rate

A SHORT HISTORICAL OVERVIEW
In this section of the paper we outline a brief overview of

some of the principal forces at play in the Canadian economy in

the 1970s.3 Further details will be presented as required in
the course of the discussion.

Canada had been on a fixed exchange rate since June 1962 (at
a value of 92.5 cents U.S.), with official reserves roughly
constant over the period at a level of between $2.5 and $3.1

billion.4 The combination of an unusually strong current
account and a normal—sized capital inflow resulted in a sharp
increase in official reserves in the first half of 1970.

Following the decision to float, (June 1, 1970), the Canadian
dollar rose rapidly from 92.5 cents to nearly $1.00 U.S.

In the

early 1970s, monetary policy was influenced by the desire to
prevent the Canadian dollar from rising much above parity with its
U.S. counterpart as long as unemployment remained well above the
levels that had

prevailed

in the latter half of the 1960s.5

3. General discussions of the Canadian economy can be found in
Courchene (1976), Freeman (1978), the Bank of Canada Annual
Report, the Department of Finance Economic Review, and the
OECD annual report on Canada. For a survey of the Canadian
balance of payments over the 1970s see MacKay and Hannah
(1979)

For part of the period, the maximum level of Canadian
reserves was determined by an agreement with the United
States.
5. One complicating factor for policy—makers throughout this
period was the upward movement in the natural rate of unemployment as a result of demographic changes and government
policy initiatives in the field of unemployment insurance.

A very important factor affecting the Canadian economy in the
1970s was the sharp movement in the relative world prices of raw

materials and manufactured goods. Since Canada is a major
exporter of raw materials, the relative price change was reflected
in a very sharp increase in the Canadian terms of trade (Figure

1). Beginning with a slow increase in 1972 04, the terms of trade
rose throughout 1973 and peaked at 1.187 in 1974 Q2. After
declining to 1.092 by 1975 01, they hovered around 1.11 until the
end of 1976 when they began a long downward slide that ended only

in 1978 04. The improvements in the terms of trade in the 1972 to
1976 period increased real incomes in Canada quite substantially
since Canadian output could be traded at very favourable rates for

the product of the rest of the world. One measure of this gain
(see Freedman (1977)) shows an increase in Canadian incomes and
potential real expenditures arising from the terms of trade
effect, of almost 0.6 percent per annum over the 1973—76 period.
For example, in the peak year, 1974, real incomes rose by over 1.5
percent because of a 7.9 percent increase in the terms of trade in

that year. A further indirect effect of the terms of trade
improvement in the early part of the decade was the upward
pressure that it exerted on the value of the Canadian dollar.
The 1970s was an unusual decade for the Canadian economy
insofar as the behaviour of unemployment and inflation rates

differed markedly from that in the United States. Whereas the
U.S. economy entered into a sharp recession in 1974, the downturn

in Canada was much less pronounced. Indeed, it was only late in

1974 that the unemployment rate began to increase in Canada,

rising gradually over the period from 1975 to mid—1978. In Figure
2, we present the unemployment rates in Canada and the United

States over the period 1964—78. The sharp rise in the prices of
internationally—traded goods and the high rates of growth of the

money supply in Canada (Figure 3) contributed to a marked increase
in the rate of price inflation both in absolute terms and relative

to the United States (Figure 4). Since the exchange rate had no
pronounced trend in the 1971—76 period, this increase in
relative prices in Canada vis—à—vis the United States resulted in
a sharp deterioration of the competitiveness of Canadian industry
according to all the conventional measures.

In late 1975, the Governor of the Bank of Canada announced a
target range of rates of growth for the narrow monetary aggregate

(Ml). The intent was to reduce the monetary growth rate gradually
in order to bring down the rate of inflation over time. Not
surprisingly, the attempt to slow the growth of the money supply

resulted in increases in short—term interest rates. With U.S.
long—term interest rates relatively low, an unusually large
long—term interest rate differential vis—à—vis the United States
developed and long—term borrowing abroad6 increased to
unprecedented levels in 1975 and 1976 (especially in the latter
year) .

These capital flows put substantial upward pressure on the

Canadian dollar.

In the fourth quarter of 1976 the Canadian dollar began its

long downward slide. By the end of 1978, the 21 percent
depreciation of the dollar was sufficient to bring the
competitiveness of Canadian goods back to the 1971 level.
However, although there was a not insignificant response in the
output and net export of tradable goods in 1977 and 1978,
improvements in the merchandise trade balance were slower than

anticipated. The slowness of the response can be
attributed, at least in part, to the fact that many tradable goods
industries were operating at near to full capacity as a result of

the sharp increase in output. The focus of attention therefore
shifted to the actual and planned investment in these industries,
in response to the capacity tightness situation resulting from the
depreciation.

DETERMINATION OF THE CANADIAN DOLLAR-U.S. DOLLAR
EXCHANGE RATE AND EXCHANGE MARKET EFFICIENCY
Several recent papers (Dornbusch (1978b), Isard (1978) and

Schadier (L977)) have

surveyed

various theoretical models of

exchanc;e ratc detenuination. In this section we examine how well

these models have done in explaining
movements of th Canadian dollar — U.S. dollar exchange

the empirical counterparts of
the

rate7 during the 1970s. Particular attention is paid to the
concept of market effic iency, under which the exchange rate is

assumed to reflect fully all available information. In the
concluding part of Section 2 we
empirical

examine

the

reasons why the

models have performed so poorly and why the exchange

market opears to have been inefficient.
2.1

Models of exchange rate determination
Perhaps

the simplest exchange rate theory is based on the

concept of purchasing—power parity (PPP). In Figure 5, four
measures of what the exchange rate (Canadian dollars per U.S.
doLlar) would have
are compared to an

been had it followed purchasing—power parity
index of the actual exchange rate

(1971l00).8 The broad measures (based on consumer prices,

Since about 70 percent of Canada's foreign trade is with the
United States, this is by far the most significant bilateral
exchange rate for Canada.

We take 1971 as a representative base year rather than 1970
because Canada returned to floating rates only in mid—1970
and there was, in the remaining months of that year, a

large appreciation which may be interpreted as a sign that
the Canadian dollar had been undervalued.

unit labour costs arid GNP deflators) do very poorly, especially

for the 1974—77 period. The export price measure moves very
little, even after 1976, which is quite surprising.9
As can easily be seen in Figure 5, real exchange rate

movements during the period were very large. Figure 6 shows two
measures of the real exchange rate — one based on relative unit

labour costs and the other on relative GNP deflators. The 24
percent appreciation of the real exchange rate on a unit labour
cost definition (18 percent on a GNP deflator definition) from
1971 to the fourth quarter of 1976, means that even exchange rate
models that enforce purchasing—power parity with a medium—term lag
cannot

explain the movements of the nominal exchange rate for that

period. The fact that the real exchange rate on either measure
had returned to approximately its 1971 level by the end of 1978
suggests that if there were real factors that caused the
appreciation of the real exchange rate, they were only of a
temporary nature (or were balanced by shocks with an opposite

effect).

On the other hand, if the movements in the real exchange

rate were due to a lagged adjustment to purchasing—power parity,
the adjustment lags were much longer than expected.

9.

if the lw of one price had held, then relative export prices
would have tracked the exchange rate exactly. Figure 5 shows
that there is little difference prior to 1977. Subsequently,
however, relative export prices do not follow the depreciating exchange rate.

13

Are there more complex empirical exchange rate models that
will track the exchange rate accurately for both the 1970—76
period and for the more recent period without the use of ad hoc

adjustments?lO The answer appears to be no. Monetarist
models, such as those of Girton and Roper (1977) and Sargen
(1977), perform poorly because of their incorporation of the

purchasing—power—parity assumption. The demand for short—term
assets model of Haas and Alexander (1979) and the eclectic model
of Freedman (1979a) track the period to the third quarter of 1976
fairly well, but require dummy variables for the subsequent

period. The Freedman model contains some insights as to what
moved the exchange rate in the earlier period, illustrating that
the Canadian—U.S. interest rate differential, the Canadian terms
of trade, relative prices, foreign borrowings and the unexpected

change in the trade balance all had significant impacts. In this
model, as in that of Haas and Alexander (and many other exchange
rate models — see Freedman (1978)), a 1 percentage point change in

the interest rate differential results, ceteris paribus, in a more
than 1 percentage point change in the exchange rate, an effect
that is larger than most theoretical models would suggest.

With portfolio balance models, difficulties appear to arise

currencies, a situation that is true for Canada. For in that case
(see Branson (1978)), an exchange rate (Canadian dollars per U.S.

dollar) that moves above equilibrium results in an excess demand
for foreign exchange which puts further upward pressure on the

exchange rate, moving the system away from equilibrium.11 We
can illustrate this point in a simple three asset case. With the
home country demand for real balances (M), bonds (B) and foreign
bonds (F) (EF in domestic currency) as functions of the domestic
interest rate (r) ,

the foreign interest rate (r*) and the expected

rate of depreciation () , one has:

M = rn(r,r*,Ee)(M÷B÷EF)
B = b(r,r*,Ee)(M+B1.EF)

There is a potentially large class of models (of the rational
expectations type) that start from the balance of payments

identity to determine the expected exchange rate. For example,
assume that market participants form their expectations of the
exchange rate such that, n periods into the future, the basic

balance will be zero. Then, given the future values of the
functional determinants of the current account and long—term

capital flows, a unique exchange rate is determined. Current and
past values of the variables could be used to 'forecast the future

values. Also, the latest data on current and capital accounts
could be compared to the forecast value based on the knowledge of
the current values of the determinants to establish whether there

has been an exogenous shift in demand or supply functions. An
example of a particular functional form that may be useful in the

approach is gven in Longworth (l979a)
With this approach, a greater role is given to the current
account, capital account, and their determinants, than in other
exchange rate models and thus it is more in the spirit of the

models of Mundell (1968) and Fleming (1962). It is much easier to

16

examine demand and relative price shocks in this type of model
than in the monetarist model.

Consider, for example, a shock to the world price of raw
materials relative to manufactured goods.

If the exchange rate

and domestic wages initially remain unchanged this will cause an
improvement in the Canadian terms of trade and the current

account. If this situation is expected to persist there must be
an appreciation of the real exchange rate to restore the basic
balance to its equilibrium level.

attempted to measure the effect of the Canadian
terms of trade on the exchange rate. Although he did find a
significant impact, the terms of trade improvement in Canada
during the mid—1970s could only be one small part of the
explanation for the appreciation of the real exchange rate. For
example, although the terms of trade peaked in the second quarter
of 1974, the real exchange rate appreciated until the fourth
Freedman

quarter of 1976 (at which time the terms of trade were 8 percent
less than

2.2

their peak value)

Exchange market efficiency
Both the Freedman and Haas—Alexander models employ lagged

exchange rates as determinants of
Thus,

the world that they describe is not one of efficient markets

which the exchange rate properly incorporates all information

as it becomes known, and in which lagged information should not

play a significant role. If the exchange market is efficient,

17

then in the absence of a risk premium, the forward exchange rate
should be an unbiased predictor of the future spot rate (see for

example, Levich (1979)). Since the current spot rate is known at
the same time as the forward rate, it is also true that the
current forward premium should be an unbiased predictor of the

change in the spot rate (Porter (1971), Levich (1979)). Longworth
(1979a) has shown that the 30—day forward premium was a biased
predictor

of the change in the spot rate for the period January

1971 through October 1976; in fact, the two variables were
strongly negative correlated. This apparent inefficiency could
not have resulted from intervention in the exchange market by the
authorities, since they appear to have been following a smoothing
rule whereby the amount of intervention was proportional to the
change in the exchange rate (Longworth (l979b)).
For

the

1977—78 period, the forward premium again failed to

be an unbiased predictor of the change in the spot rate; the

constant term, which indicates a trend in the rate of depreciation
unaccounted for by the forward premium, was significant in the
regression of the change in the spot rate on the forward premium.

Thus, at least at first glance, the exchange market appears to
have been inefficient for this period as well.
The question arises as to what new information caused the

exchange rate to move. In a study of changes in the exchange rate
from month—end to month—end, Loiigworth (1979a) found that changes

(which are assumed to be unexpected) in the interest rate

differential and unexpected

in foreign borrowing were

move7n-t

18

important in both sub—periods,'2 with the unexpected movement
in the merchandise trade balance significant for the 1977—78

period. Although changes in relative prices, relative costs,
rela1ive money supplies and the terms of trade often had the
correct sign, they were never significant.

2.3 Possible reasons why the market appears to have
been inefficient
Since

the Longworth efficient markets model has little

exp].anatory power, one must assume eiLber that some important
economic md icators have been overlooked or that the significance
of certain information is only appreciaed with time — thus the

lagged exchange rate in the Freedman model is indicative of a
partial-adjustment mechanism. Why might one expect these lags?
riarket

participants must be able to distinguish between

in nominal variables and changes in real variables, as
well as between changes of a permanent and a temporary nature. It
is perhaps possible that the market was concentrating on the
nominal, rather than the real exchange rate. Since, as Mussa
(L976) has pointed out, for many years the exchange rate remained
very close to unity, this could have served as a strong anchor for
expectations. For a time immediately after the dollar was allowed
to float in 1970, the Bank of Canada was acting to reinforce

changes

12. Given the important role ascribed to interest rate
differentials and foreign borrowings in both the Freedman

and Lonqworth models, they are discussed in Section 3 with
special emphasis on the large borrowings observed during
1976.

19

expectations that the nominal exchange rate would not deviate much

from the usual range. Thus the Bank of Canada Annual Report for
1970 (page 9) notes that "It is therefore still necessary to seek
a mix of fiscal and monetary policy which encourages levels of
interest rates in Canada that are consistent with the exchange
rate staying within a suitable range.t'

Courchene (1976, page 161) has written, "after a full year of
combatting inflation [1969—70] despite the fact that Canada was on
a fixed exchange rate, when the rate floated and Canada was
finally allowed the independence to pursue its own policies with
respect to the behaviour of prices, the concern over inflation was
immediately jettisoned in favour of ensuring that the exchange
rate was set at an 'appropriate level' ...,

the net result of

attempting to obtain an 'appropriate' exchange rate was a very
large increase in the rate of monetary expansion, the legacy of

which is our current [1976] inflation rate." The rate of monetary
expansion, after adjustment for the growth in demand for real

money balances as a function of real income, was much faster than

that in the United States for the first half of the decade. This
contributed to more rapid growth of unit labour costs and prices
in Canada than in the United States.

The exchange market appears to have largely ignored the

significant appreciation of the real exchange rate. Also, because
of lags in adjustment to the real exchange rate and because of the
terms of trade improvement associated with the world—wide

commodity boom, there was no immediate significant deterioration

20

in

the nominal merchandise trade balance to alert the market.

Nor was there a strong signal from the basic balance in the

1970—76 period. The basic balance was

positive

from 1970 to 1973

and only slightly negative in 1974 and 1975. As the current
account balance went negative in 1974 (—$1.46 billion) and 1975
(—$4.76 billion) , long—term capital inflows increased from $1.04

billion in 1974 to $3.94 billion in 1975.

Then, as long—term

capital inflows more than doubled to $7.91 billion in 1976 and the

balance strengthened (partly because of an
improvement in the terms of trade) , the basic balance reached an

merchand ise trade

historical high of $4.11 billion.
a rational framework for exchange rate determination, the
terms of trade improvement and the high level of capital inflows
would have to have been considered largely permanent for the value
of the Canadian dollar to have remained at the high level that it
In

did. Yet previous experience had shown that terms of trade
improvements, which in Canada are primarily associated with an

increase in the world price of raw materials relative to the world
price of manufactured goods (Longworth (l979a)), tended to reverse
themselves — the Korean War boom being a case in point. As well,
large increases in long—term capital inflows, such as the 40
percent increase in 1969 over 1968, also tended to he temporary
—

e.g., in 1970 capital inflows fell below the 1968 figure.
When most of the variation in a series is typically due to
temporary disturbances, then it is rational to assume that any

particular change in that series is due to a temporary shock that

21

will reverse itself. If exchange rate determination is based upon
an examination of underlying fundamentals, the Canadian case

appears to be very puzzling. On the other hand, if market
participants were in fact concentrating on the nominal exchange
rate and viewed deviations from unity as being temporary, the
behaviour of the exchange rate from 1971 to 1976 is more easily
understood.

Such behaviour would require the absence of a large number of
speculators basing their decisions on underlying economic

determinants. As McKinnon (1976) has observed, there may not be a
large pool of capital available for speculation over long periods

of time. Although there is a good deal of speculation over
periods of hours or days or weeks, there seems to be insufficient
capital to smooth the real exchange rate so that it reflects
economic fundamentals.

CANADIAN EXTERNAL BORROWING IN THE MID—1970s

3

One of the very interesting aspects of economic behaviour
over the 1970s was the movement of long—term capital flows and,
more specifically, the movement of gross new issues abroad by

provinces, municipal it ies arid corporat. ions. As the
aggregate data show (Table 1, column 1), after remaining at levels
of between $1 and $2 .)1li1Ofl between 1964 and 1973, gross new
issues abroad virtually doubled in i.')74, doubled again in 1975,

at the determinants of long—term capital inflows in terms of

markets.13

In the course of the analysis some simple models of interest
rate and exchange rate determination are used to focus on the
relationship between tie expectation of future inflation
incorporated in the long—term interest rate, and that incorporated
in the expected exchange rate. One of the puzzles underlying the
entire discussion is why Canadian boowers issued enormous
terms of a portfolio choice framework, we would expect
the

amount of borrowing in a qiven market to he a function

of the cost of borrowing in that market relative to the
cost of borrowing in other markets, and the relative risks
of borrowing in the two markeLs. That is, we assume that
long—term borrowers are risk-averse and require a reduction
in the relative cost of borrowing in external markets to
offset the extra risk involved in issuing more securities
denominated in foreign currenci.es.

amounts of foreign—pay securities in 1976 at a time when high
Canadian interest rates were believed to reflect (at least in
part) inflationary expectations, and when the Canadian dollar was
widely believed to be overvalued.

3.1 A closer look at the data
In column 2 of Table 1, we present the total gross new issues
to foreigners by provinces, municipalities and corporations over
the 1964—78 period, scaled by nominal GNP. As can be seen from

the data in columns 1 and 2, the reduction of foreign borrowing in
the early 1970s was more than reversed in the mid—1970s, and
inflows reached historically unprecedented levels in 1976.
Another way to look at the data is to examine external
borrowing by provinces, municipalities and corporations as a share

of their total borrowing (see columns 3 to 6, Table 1). Once
again the pattern of sharp increases in the mid—seventies stands
out.

These were years of very substantial deficits for the

provinces and municipalities and large total issues by all three
i:ypes of borrowers, a very considerable share of which was
financed abroad.

An important element in modelling long—term capital flows
rests on the question of who bears the exchange risk ——

the

foreign lender or the domestic borrower. In contrast to most
theoretical models in which the foreign lender purchases domestic

currency bonds issued by a domestic borrower and hence takes on

25

the exchange risk, in Canada it is traditionally the domestic

borrower who takes on the exchange risk by issuing foreign—pay

bonds. Until the mid—1970s the only important exception to this
pattern was the federal Government, some of whose outstanding
Canadian dollar obligations have been purchased by

foreigners.14 Thus, almost all the foreign holdings of
provincial, municipal and corporate bonds were in the form of

foreign—pay bonds specifically issued to tap foreign markets. In
the mid—1970s, however, with the growth of the Euro—Canadian
dollar market, there were some issues of Canadian dollar
obligations abroad in which the lender took on the exchange risk.
In Table 2, we present the data for 1970—78, dividing issues
abroad by Canadian provinces, municipalities and corporations into

Canadian dollar issues, U.S. dollar issues, Euro—U.S. dollar
issues, Euro—Canadian dollar issues, and other foreign currency

issues. In the last five columns of the Table, we present the
share of total domestic and foreign issues represented by each
category of bonds.-'-5 The growth of issues abroad in 1975 and

1976 was substantially larger than the rise in foreign—pay issues
over this period because of the large issues of Euro—Canadian

dollar bonds in 1975 by provincial governments, and in 1976, by

14. This ignores purchases of corporate equity by foreigners
which at times have been substantial. We restrict the
discussion that follows to bond issues.
15. We assume throughout that the proportion of these foreign—pay
bonds held by Canadians can safely be ignored.

Although the results of the former equation are much better
than those of the latter, they explain only about 20 percent of

movement of interest rates in
1975—76 is not sufficiently large to xplain the increase in
borrowing during this period. However, the main objection to this
the variations. Furthermore, the

type of simple regression is that it ignores the possibility that
the exchange rate expected to prevail t the time of interest
payments and principal repayment may not be the same as the

current exchange rate. That is, the use of the nominal interest
rate differential uncorrected for expected changes in exchange
rates is very questionable during a period of differing inflation
rates and floating exchange rates.
In order to examine the magnitide of exchange rate risk, we
turn next to an analysis of the mathematics of bond prices.
Although couched in terms of borrower behaviour, the following
analysis can also be used to examine the behaviour of a foreign
lender taking on the risk of excharije rate change, as in the case
of Euro—Canadian dollar issues.

McLeod, Young, Wiverage bond rate for the particular
borrower

in Canada and the Moodys corporate bond industrial
average rate in the United States. For the later part of
the period it would be appropriate to enter in addition, the
differential between Canadian rates and Euro—bond rates,
because of the growing importance of the Euro—markets as

shown in Table 2.

For the moment ignore the third regression in each section
of the Table.

31

3.2 Some simple mathematics of bond prices
In this section, the following notation is used:

RLC — interest rate on long—term Canadian dollar bonds;
RLU — interest rate on long—term U.S. dollar bonds;
n

—

term to maturity;

S(t) — exchange rate at time t, defined as Canadian dollar price

of one U.S. dollar;
i

—

yield

to maturity;

rlc — real loncy-terrn interest rate in Canada;
rlu — real long—term interest rate in the United States;
— rate of inflation in Canada; and
T'c
nu

—

rate

of inflation in the United States.

When a Canadian borrower issues a $1 U.S. bond abroad, he

receives $S(Q) in Canadian funds at the time of issue. In return
he pays $(RLU) S(L) interest at time t, and $1S(n) principal
repayment in Canadian funds at time n (where RLU, the U.S. long

rate is equal to the coupon on U.S. dollar bonds). The yield to
maturity on such a bond can he calculated by solving the following
equation:

S(O) =

f (RLU)S(t)e'tdt

+

S(n)e

(1)

Traditionally, Canadian borrowers have determined the
protection against a depreciation afforded by lower U.S. interest

32

rates by calculating the amount of the depreciation that would
result in the bond yield being equal to the cost of borrowing in

Canada, or RLC. There is a variety of possible exchange rate
movements that one could postulate in carrying out this
calculation; the most common one used is one in which a
once—and—for—all depreciation of the Canadian currency occurs

immediately after the issue of the bond. That is, 5(1) = S(2)
=

S(n)

S(O). The equation then becomes

S(O) =f(RLU)S(l)e1tdt+S(i)em

(1')

To determine the S(1) that would raise the cost of borrowing in
the United States to the cost of borrowing in Canada, we may
rewrite equation (1') as:

S(O)

S(O) = RLU
S(l)

(2)

—RLCn
[1 — e
]

+ e -RLCn

(2

In the case of a perpetuity, n approaches infinity and
S(O)/S(l) = RLJU/RLC.

For example, if RLU were 8 percent and RLC

were 9 percent and S(O) were 1.00, then the immediate depreciation
that would wipe out the gains from borrowing in the United States
would be an increase in S to 1.125 in period 1, i.e., a fall in

33

the value of the Canadian dollar to 88.9 cents U.S. Note that it
is the ratio between the two interest rates, and not the
differential, that is relevant to the calculation in the case of a

perpetuity. In the more general case of the term bond, one can
analyze the effect on S(l) of changes in RLU, RLC, and n by
differentiating the expression with respect to these parameters.
Since the results do not yield a great deal of intuitive
understanding, it is perhaps more useful to illustrate the
magnitude of the effect by the examples in Table 4•20

By comparing lines 1 and 3, one can see that for equal
proportional differences in interest rates, the rise in the
exchange rate that wipes Out the gain to the borrower is the same

20. A similar ta1e caEe found in Caves and Reuber (1971),

34

in the case of a perpetuity but quite different for a term bond.

Also, by comparing lines 1 and 2, one can see that for the equal
absolute differences in interest rates, the depreciation
protection is virtually the same for bonds of short maturity, but

differs substantially for bonds of long maturity. The reason for
these results is that the longer the maturity, the larger the role
that interest payments play compared to the principal repayment.
With short maturities the cost of the depreciation operates mainly

through the increase in the cost of the principal repayment. With
long maturities, it operates in substantial part via its effect on

the Canadian dollar value of the interest payments.
The results shown in Table 4 indicate that for a bond of
20—year maturity, the protection factor can neither be expressed
raising

only

in terms of the interest rate differential nor only in terms

of the ratio of interest rates. It is, therefore, perhaps
somewhat surprising that the regressions discussed above and

in Table 3 all indicate that the differential performs
substantially better than the ratio of interest rates.
The exercise we have carried out thus far has been a fairly

presented

mechanical

one illustrating the relationship between rates in

Canada

and the United States and the depreciation that would wipe

out the

gain to the Canadian borrower. However, there are also

economic relationships between interest rate differentials and
expected exchange rate changes.

For instance, take a simple pair

of assumptions that are characteristic of a strong monetarist

35

position: (a) long—term interest rates are equal to a real rate
plus the expected rate of inflation over the term to maturity,
i.e., the Fisher effect always holds; and (b) movements in

exchange rates are the result of a difference in inflation rates

in the two countries. This gives

Thus, the difference in the cost of borrowing in the United States

differential in real interest rates is, it is by assumption
unaffected by changes in rates of inflation and nominal interest
rates and, hence, the decision as to whether to borrow in the
United States or Canada should not he a function of nominal

differentials.

To put it slightly differently, the nominal

interest rate in each country incorporates an inflationary
premium.

rates were the change in this inflationary premium (i.e., real
rates were always constant) ,

this

change should he reflected in the expected exchange rate

over the life of the bond and, therefore, should not result in any
change in the borrowing decision.21

3.3 Possible explanations of observed patterns of borrowing
Since observed movements in external borrowing over the
mid—1970s clearly imply some response in borrower or lender
behaviour to movements in nominal rates, one or more of the

assumptions made above must be invalid.22 We will examine
the possible sources of the observed behaviour under the following
four headings:
i)

Expectations of future inflation are formed

differently in the bond market and the foreign
exchange market.
ii)

The Fisher effect does not always hold in the
bond market.

iii) Purchasing—power parity does not always hold in
the foreign exchange market.

the ause of the chaige in the interest rate and inflation
rate. In a model with perfect foresight this level change
would take place at the instant the change in money growth
was announced and hence would not affect any transactions
that occurred thereafter, such as borrowing that takes place
at the new interest rates. Since this level change cannot
be anticipated there is no way in which any transactor can
take advantage of its occurrence. In Figure 8A we present
the

effects on the exchange rate, interest rate, and prices,

of a decUne in the rate of growth of the Canadian money
supply below that of the U.S. money supply, under the

of rational expectations. The value S(O) in the
text is the level of the exchange rate in the instant after
the change in money supply growth is announced. For a
general discussion of the level change in the case of a

For a similar analysis of short—term money markets, see
Aliber (1976).

iv)

Other factors are also important in determining
the location of borrowing.

3.3(1) Inconsistent expectations in bond markets and
foreign exchange markets
There is relatively little of an analytic nature that can be

said about this possibility. Given the long history of the
Canadian dollar being relatively close in value to one U.S.

dollar, it may have been difficult for borrowers to envisage a
situation in which the two currencies diverge continuously over
time.23 Indeed, borrowers may have been influenced by parity

psychology whereby the Canadian dollar is perceived to be roughly

equal to the U.S. dollar over the long run. Nonetheless, if the
best estimates of relative long—run inflationary movements are
reflected in the differential between bond rates in the two
countries, one would expect these same estimates to he used in the

calculation of the expected exchange rate. Thus, one would have
to assume a substantial amount of irrationality if one argued that
there were inconsistent expectations in the two markets.

3.3(u) The Fisher effect does not always hold in the
bond market

There are two sub—cases in this instance. First, the long
rate is determined by the expectations theory of the term

23. For example, the implication of a one percentage point differential between Canadian and U.S. rates of inflation over
twenty years is a 22 percent depreciation of the Canadian

dollar over that period. Even if
the

39

structure, but the short rate does not always move one—to—one in

response to the rate of inflation. Thus, for example, Friedman
(1968) has argued that in response to a decrease in the rate of
growth of the money supply, there are liquidity, income, and

inflationary effects on the interest rate. Short—term interest
rates thus rise initially and then fall back to their original
level before falling to a level consistent with the new, lower
rate of inflation brought about by the decline in money supply

growth. Most empirical work now suggests that the time required
before the short rate reaches its new equilibrium level can be
rather long.

The effect of such a divergence from equilibrium of short
rates can give rise to substantial divergences in the movements of
the long rate from the full Fisher effect, at least in the short

run. For example, suppose that in response to a slowing in the
rate of growth of the money supply of one percentage point, one
had the following annual short—term interest rates starting from
an initial level of 6 percent ——

6.30, 6.00, 5.50 and 5.00

thereafter. If the long—term interest rate had originally also
been 6 percent, and if the expectations theory of the term
structure held exactly, the 20—year long rate would take the
following values —— 5.21 percent in the first period, 5.11 percent

in the second period, 5.04 percent in the third period, and 5.00

percent thereafter.24 Note that when the market foresees

approximation, as developed in Modigliani and Shiller
(1973) and Shiller (1979).

one has

divergent movements in the short run, with the short rate

increasing

and the long rate falling substantially. Despite the

fact. that the lonq rate rema ins above its new equil ibrium level
for a period of time, there will be no gain to borrowing abroad
after the announcement of the decline in the money supply growth,
if one assumes that the exchange market responds rationally to the
expected movements in interest rates.25
If U.S. interest rates remained at 6 percent, then as shown
in Figure 8B, there would be an immediate appreciation of the
Canadian dollar, followed by a gradual movement back to the
long—run equilibrium as determined by purchasing—power—parity
considerations. Thus, if in the very long run, Canadian rates are
I percentage point below U.S. rates and the Canadian dollar
appreciates by 1 percent per year in an offsetting fashion, in the
period after the announcement, Canadian long rates would be only
79 basis points below U.S. rates, but the expected appreciation of
the

Canadian

dollar over the 20—year period in which the bond is

outstanding, would be less than 1 percent per year, thereby again

equalizing returns. In effect, there would be a sharp
25. Here we define rationality in the sense of Dornbusch (1976,
l978a) , where the current spot rate is equal to the expected
spot rate discounted by the interest rate differential
plus one. We treat the expected spot rate in the distant
future as determined by PPP considerations, and use the
product of one plus the short rates in the discount
factor. In a case in which the expectations theory of
the term structure holds, this is the same as discounting
using one plus the long rate.

appreciation of the Canadian dollar in response to the
unanticipated announcement of a decline in the rate of growth of
the money supply and thereafter there would be equalization of

costs internationally. Thus, even when the Fisher

effect does not hold in the short run, there will be no response
in external borrowing to a nominal interest rate change, provided

that the expectations theory of the term structure holds, the spot
exchange rate adjusts to interest rates and, in the long run, PPP

holds.
The second sub—case to be considered is one in which the
expectations theory of the term structure does not provide an

explanation of movements in long—term interest rates. Recent
studies for the United States (see Shiller (1979)) and Canada
(Freedman (1979b)) suggest that the long—term bond rate is more
volatile than it would be under the pure expectations theory.
Thus, when short rates rise, long rates tend to rise as well and
by more than anticipated on the basis of pure expectations.
However, the long rate tends to rise less than would be expected

If the short—term rate were a martingale. For example, the rise
in short rates from 6 percent to 6.30 percent might be expected to
lead to a rise in long rates from 6 percent to, say, 6.05 percent.
Since long—term interest rates rise rather than fall in response

a decline in the rate of growth of the money supply, real
long—term interest rates would be substantially higher in this
instance than in the first sub—case for the period of adjustment.
to

Not surprisingly, this would lead to substantial borrowing in

43

foreign markets. In this sub—case, the element of rationality in
long—term borrowing decisions stems from the "irrationality" in
the setting of long—term interest rates whereby long—term real
rates can move quite markedly in response to a change in money
supply growth.

On average, experience in Canada tends to accord with the
notion that long rates move in the same direction as short rates

but with a response coefficient of about 0.2. However, the
movements of interest rates in 1976 seem to be more consistent
with the first model than with the second; short rates tended to
rise somewhat in 1976 while long rates fell substantially (Figure

9). To the extent that Canadian long rates fell in response to
the fall in expected inflation rates in Canada, one would have
expected a corresponding rise in the expected long—run value of

the Canadian dollar. However, since U.S. long rates fell by about
the same amount as Canadian long rates over 1976, interest rate

differentials remained unchanged —

although by historical

standards they were at a high level. If the fall in the U.S. rate
had been a response to a decline in inflationary expectations in
the United States, then the relative positions of the two
currencies and the relative expected inflation rates would have
remained unchanged in 1976, thereby leaving open the question as
to why external borrowing grew so rapidly in 1976.26

26. There is a view that Canadian long rates move in sympathy
with U.S. long rates (Lynch (1979)). Although this model
breaks the link between long rates and expected rates of
domestic inflation, it leaves unexplained changes in the
between Canadian and U.S. long rates.

3.3(iij) Purchasing—power parity does not always hold
As noted above, the period leading into 1976 was
characterized by an increasing divergence of the exchange rate

from purchasing—power parity. However, this should have acted in
the direction of reducing borrowing even at large real interest
rate differentials, since over the long term one might have

expected PPP to be re—established. Hence, the protection factor
was substantially less than might have appeared to be the case,

the overhang of "overvaluation" (in PPP terms) . On the
other hand, if the market believed that the Canadian dollar was
high because of some real change that was permanent, then relative
given

PPP would hold from that point in time.

In this case, we would be

in the situation described earlier in which borrowers
incorporate notions of expected future rates of inflation into
both exchange rate expectations and long—term interest rates.
back

The purchase of five—year Euro—Canadian dollar instruments by

foreigners

is even more difficult to understand from this

perspective. As was demonstrated earlier, a five—year instrument
provides relatively little protection against a depreciation, even
at fairly substantial interest rate differentials.

And, given the

overvaluation of the Canadian dollar in PPP terms, the degree of

protection was even less. It can perhaps be argued that the
market was overly impressed by Canada's position as a producer of
resources, leading it to ignore the indications that the Canadian
dollar was much more likely to fall in value than to rise.

46

3.3(iv) Other factors

assertion is sometimes made that Canadian issuers have to
place a greater proportion of their borrowings abroad in periods
of large borrowing requirements because of the inability of the
An

Canadian market to absorb them fully. The third equation in each
section of Table 3 (page 29 )

represents

a simple attempt to

evaluate this thesis by regressing the share of bonds issued
abroad (EXTSHARE) by each borrower on the interest rate
differential (INTDIFF), and on total bond issues of that borrower
(TOTISSUE), divided by nominal GNP.

In the case of provinces and

municipalities, this "market pressure" variable is significant,
while in the case of the corporate sector, although it has the

correct sign, it is insignificant. The estimated coefficients
indicate that between 1973 and 1976 the total issue variable would
account for increases of 13.7, 3.6 and 3.0 percentage points,
respectively, in the share of provincial, municipal, and corporate

borrowing abroad. By way of comparison, the movements of interest
rates between the same two years would account for 7.8, 15.4 and
26.0 percentage points of the increase in the shares issued
abroad.

There were also two policy changes in 1975 that contributed

to the increase in external borrowing. First, the official
request made late in 1970 to major borrowers to consider the

domestic market carefully before entering foreign markets, was

withdrawn early in 1975. Second, in mid—1975 the 15 percent

47

federal withholding tax on interest payments was removed on new
corporate bond issues having maturities of five years and over.

Although both these changes acted in the direction of increasing
external borrowing, they were clearly not sufficient by themselves
to explain the massive increases in 1975 and 1976.

3.4 Some implications
When deciding in which market to issue bonds, borrowers are
forced to make forecasts of exchange rates into the distant

future. Given the enormous uncertainty regarding these forecasts,
it is not surprising that at times the decisions taken can, with

hindsight, be seen to have been at least questionable. In the
theoretical analysis above, we have argued that there was some
inconsistency between the expectation as to the future behaviour
of prices incorporated in bond interest rates, and that

incorporated into expected exchange rates. It is probably the
case that there was an element of truth in all the arguments
discussed above: (i) borrowers were still influenced by parity
psychology, or at least they were unwilling to believe that a
continually depreciating Canadian dollar was possible; (ii)

increases in long—term rates reflected in part increases in real
rates of interest and not solely inflationary premia; and (iii)
perceptions as to the absorptive capacity of Canadian markets
affected at least some borrowers.

The result of these factors was the enormous borrowing abroad
in the mid—i.970s. The movement of the U.S. dollar from a high of

48

1.04 in August 1975 to a low of .9626 in June 1976, and its

consequent pause on a plateau at about .975 until November 1976,
are at least in part attributable to the massive capital inflows
from 1975 Q4 through 1976 Q4.

If the Canadian authorities should succeed in bringing the
Canadian inflation rate down below the U.S. inflation rate for any
length of time, there may be some transitional complications
caused by a reduction in borrowing abroad by Canadian residents.
With long—term nominal interest rates in Canada lower than those
in the United States, Canadian borrowers may reduce their
borrowing abroad despite the fact that the expected appreciation
of the Canadian dollar would offset the extra cost of borrowing

abroad. The depreciation of the Canadian dollar that would follow
would complicate to some extent efforts to achieve better price

performance in Canada vis——vis the United States. The crucial
point is that as long as a fixed—rate psychology, at any qiven
exchange rate, continues to affect the way long—run exchange rate
expectations are formed, the Canadian dollar may go through
periods of overvaluation and undervaluation as long—term capital
flows respond to nominal rather than real interest rate

differentials. Furthermore, the problem will be compounded on the
way to equilibrium by the tendency of long rates to move more than
the expectations theory of the term structure would suggest.
Thus, international capital flows may present some difficulties in
achieving a lower inflation rate in Canada than in the United

States. However, when the market is convinced that such a result
can be achieved, then these adjustment problems will disappear.

REAL EFFECTS: THE ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES

In this section we examine the effects of movements in the

terms of trade and the real exchange rate on the allocation of
resources27 and the distribution of income.
A change in the relative price of raw materials has an impact
on the relative outputs of resource—based industries and

non—resource—based manufacturing. Movements in the relative price
of raw materials, the real exchange rate (on a unit labour cost
basis) and U.S. CNP affect the allocation of resources between the
tradable and non—tradable goods sectors of the economy and thus
the merchandise trade balance (both on a nominal and real basis).
Real exchange rate movements also have implications for the

distribution of income between wages and profits. Finally,
changes in the terms of trade and the real exchange rate affect
the perceived profitability of business fixed investment.
If we believed that Canada could be adequately modelled as a
small open economy, then our analysis would proceed along the
lines of Salter (1959), Swan (1960), and Dornbusch (1974, 1975).
However, there is evidence presented in Longworth (1979a) that

Canada is not a price—taker for manufactured goods, especially in
the short run, and Appelbaum and Kohli (1979) come to the

the trade balance.

directly. Our interest is with shifts of

50

conclusion that Canada cannot be modelled as a small open economy

for its exports. There has been little success in estimating

export supply curves at any level of aggregation. Most studies
therefore follow the Dornbusch—Krugman (1976) approach of
estimating export price equations as functions of foreign output

prices and domestic input costs. Export demands are then
estimated as a function of relative prices and foreign income, as
in RDX2, the Bank of Canada's econometric model (Bank of Canada
(1976))

modelling the effects of changes in the relative price of
raw materials and the real exchange rate, we choose to deal with a
In

three—sector model. Suppose that the three sectors of the economy
are: resource—based tradable goods (denoted by subscript R);
non—resource—based tradable goods (denoted by subscript NR); and
non—tradable goods including services (denoted by subscript NT)

We assume that wages are the same across sectors and do not

attempt to build a dynamic model of wage movements. Labour is the
only variable input in the resource—based and non—tradable goods
sectors,

hut both labour and resources are used in the

non—resource—based tradable goods sector.
We assume that the law of one price holds for resources. If
the industry were characterized by perfect competition, then one
could write the supply function in logarithmic form as:

51

SR = a0 + al(pR_w) + a2kR

where s

(11)

is the log of supply,

k is the log of the capital stock,
p is the log of the price, and
w is the log of unit labour costs.

All the coefficients are positive. From the law of one price:

+ e

where *

denotes a foreign variable, and

e is the log of the exchange rate.

If there were oligopolistic elements in the industry, as there may
be in some mining industries and the newsprint industry, then the
reduced—form output equation may include foreign demand as well:

SR = a0 + al(pR_w) + a2kR + a3y*

(11')

For the non—resource—based tradable goods industry (which we
define as manufacturing other than pulp and paper, wood and
primary metals) ,

prices

in the rest of the world are assumed to

depend on the costs of the two inputs, resources and labour:

This price equation implicitly defines supply behaviour. Foreign
demand is assumed to be of the form:

dN = d0

unit labour costs (w*+e_w) .

Domestic demand for domestically—

produced tradable goods will also be positively related to
(w*+e_w) , as well as to domestic real income, which will be a

function

of the terms of trade and foreign income y. If the two

53

demands are summed, the reduced—form output of non—resource—based

tradables (q) will be a positive function of the real
exchange rate, foreign income, and (pR—w) if the latter acts as
a proxy for income gains resulting from improvements in the terms
of trade:28

Equilibrium in the market for non—tradable goods is assumed
to hold when demand, which is a function of real income (yr) and

equal to supply, which is a function of the capital stock and the
price of non—tradables relative to unit labour costs.

In the type of simple model proposed above we have neglected
a number of influences, particularly domestic monetary and fiscal

policy. We assume to a first approximation that these exert equal
impact on all sectors and so we concentrate on the ratios of
outputs in the various sectors (particularly since this is how one

can easily measure changes in the allocation of resources). Since
the effect of changes in relative prices on output is likely to

dominate the effects of induced real income, the model predicts
that the ratio of output in resource industries to output in the
non—resource—based tradable goods industry would be related
directly to the price of resources relative to unit labour costs,
inversely to the real exchange rate and, with indeterminate sign,

to U.S. GNP. The ratio of the output of tradables to the output
of non—tradables is predicted to be directly related to the price
of resources relative to unit labour costs, the real exchange
rate, and U.S. GNP.3°

In

the following sections, the preceding model is applied to

the Canadian economy during the period 1971—78. Specific emphasis
is placed on:

—

The composition of industrial production between
resource—based and non—resource—based industries.

— The
division of output between tradables and non—
tradables.

— The merchandise trade balance.
—

Income distribution.

—

Investment behaviour.

30. There may be a considerable asymmetry in the system, however,
because in the short run the supply of tradables can drop
considerably, but since it takes time to increase the
capital stock, the supply cannot increase appreciably unless
the economy is initially operating at low levels of capacity
util ization.

56

Particular attention is paid to three distinct sub—periods:
Period I

1972 Qi — 1974 Q2 — a period associated with a

merchandise terms of trade improvement of 18 percent.
Period II

1974 Q3 — 1976 Q4 — a period associated with a

lower terms of trade and a steady worsening of
Canada's competitive position (in terms of relative
unit labour costs)
Period III

1977 Q1 — 1978 Q4 — a period associated with a

steady devaluation of the Canadian dollar and a
steady improvement in Canada's competitive position.

4.1 The composition of industrial production between resource—
based and non—resource—based industries
A rise in the price of resources (raw materials) relative to
manufactured goods should cause output in resource—based
industries to increase more rapidly than in non—resource—based
industries —

not

only because the output price has risen for

resource industries but possibly because the foreign output price
for non—resource—based tradables may not have risen sufficiently
to cover the increased costs of the inputs of raw materials.

By classifying forestry, mining, pulp and paper, wood and
primary metals as resource—based industries, and other
manufacturing as non—resource—based industry, one can then look at
the ratios of the real domestic product indices for these two
groups as presented in Figure 10.

In Figure 10 one can see the

increased relative output effect of the rise in the relative price

of raw materials in the 1972 Q4 — 1973 Q4 period. After that,

output in the resource—based industries declines relative to that

of other manufacturing. However, if one abstracts from the trend
decline in the output of resource—based industries relative to the
others one notes that production in resource—based industries (see
Figure 11), was above trend from 1972 Q4 to 1975 Qi, generally the
period that raw material prices were high relative to unit labour

costs (Figure 12). One reason for the downward trend in relative
outputs may be the low level of investment in many sectors of the
mining industry, where it appears it may often be more profitable
to establish new mines in developing countries rather than in
Canada.

to have affected the non—resource—based industries more

strongly in the 1976 Q4 — 1977 Q4 period, Similarly, the recovery

the production of non—resource—based goods.

The model presented in the preceding section suggests that
the ratio of the output of resource—based industries (rdpres)
relative to that of non—resource—based tradable goods industries
(rdpnre) ,

should vary directly with the ratio of the price of

resources (proxied by the price of raw materials —— prm) to

relative price prm*_w* constant, the sign of the real

The real exchange rate variable did not enter significantly in

preliminary regressions and therefore was deleted. The evidence
is also very weak concerning the effect of the ratio of the price
of raw materials to domestic unit labour costs.

4.2 The division of output between tradable and non—tradable
goods
One can write the relative price of domestically—produced
tradables to non—tradables as:

T" E ) E

NT

61

where

Pp

is the domestic price of tradables (a

geometrically weighted average of the price
of resources and the price of non—resource—based
tradables),
E

is the exchange rate, and

NT is the price of non—tradables.

If the law of one price holds, T= PT/E. However, in our

model we do not assume that this law holds for non—resource—based

tradable goods; thus T is only a major determinant of the
movements of Pp/E.

The stylized facts for the 1970s are as follows: In Period

I,

T and PT/E were rising relative to NT with E showing
little variation; in Period II, P'p and Pp/E were falling

relative to NT and E was again exhibiting little change; and
in Period III, E was rising. Relative outputs moved as expected
given the changes in relative prices, with the output of tradables
rising relative to the output of non—tradables in Periods I and

III, and falling in Period II. These results are shown in Figure
13 using two different definitions for tradable goods. The first
definition encompasses forestry and mining as well as

manufacturing. In the second case we concentrate on manufacturing
alone.

If foreign demand affects output directly in addition to its
impact via prices, then the growth in the U.S. economy in 1972—73

and 1977—78 likely contributed to the increased output of the

tradable goods sector in those years. The pattern of the U.S.
decline in 1974 and recovery in 1975—76 is not accurately mirrored
in the pattern of tradable goods production in Canada in the

1974—76 period, however, and thus cannot be the sole explanatory
variable.

The theory presented above suggests that the ratio of
tradables production to non—tradables production (rdptra—rdpntr)
should be positively related to the price of raw materials
relative to unit labour costs, the real exchange rate (w*+e_w) and

U.S. GNP (gnp*) relative to trend.32 Since manufactured
goods constitute the majority of tradable goods, a similar
equation should hold for the split between manufactured (rdpman)

and non—manufactured goods (rdpnm). The following simple
regressions were estimated for 1971 Qi — 1978 Q4:
rdptra—rdpntr = — 5.58 + .l09(prm—w) + .l33(w*+e_w)

The equations strongly bear out the expected positive impacts
of increased raw materials prices and the real exchange

rate.33 In the second equation the coefficient on TIME is
approximately the negative of the coefficient on gnp* times the
trend increase per quarter in gflp*; thus only deviations in gnp*

from trend affect the output split. In the case of rdptra—rdpntr,
there

is a slight downward trend independent of the effect of the

trend in gflp*.
4.3

The merchandise trade balance
The

merchandise trade balance (in volume terms) is

determined by

the difference between the domestic output of

tradables and the domestic demand for tradables. In this
preliminary study we have provided an explicit model only for the
output of tradables, leaving the domestic demand for tradables to

future research. One may note, however, that there is a
resemblance, however rough, between the path of the relative
output of tradable goods in Figure 13 and the constant dollar
merchandise trade balance in Figure 14.

the extent that the domestic demand for tradables varies
inversely with the ratio of tradable goods prices to wages, an
increase in the real exchange rate, i.e., a depreciation, should
both increase the supply of tradables and decrease the domestic
demand for them, increasing the trade balance. To the extent that
To

33. When the levels of rdptra and rdpman alone are the dependent
variables, the coefficients on (w*+e_w) are surprisingly low.
This

puzzle remains to be explained.

at the same time an exogenous terms of trade improvement causes
real income gains, these decreased demand effects may be partially
offset.

The exogenous increase in the price of tradables relative to
the price of non—tradables led to a steady improvement in the
current dollar merchandise trade balance in Period I to a peak

of

$3.1 billion in 1974 Ql (see Figure 14). However, since Canada
had experienced real income gains because of the terms of trade
improvement, domestic demand for tradables outstripped the

increased output of tradables. Thus there was a steady worsening
of the constant dollar merchandise trade balance from $1.9 billion
in 1973 Ql to —$2.1 billion in 1974 Q2.

Period II can be divided into three sub—periods. From
1974 Q3 — 1975 Ql, the constant dollar trade balance worsened from

—$2.4 billion to —$2.6 billion because of the appreciation of the
real exchange rate and the U.S. recession; the current dollar
trade balance deteriorated even more because of an exogenous

decline in the terms of trade. From 1975 Q2 — 1976 Qi, both the
current and constant dollar trade balances remained at very low

levels. Even though the relative output of tradables was falling
in 1976 Q2 — 1976 Q4, there was a slight improvement in both the
current and

constant

dollar trade balances, perhaps because of the

effect of the U.S. recovery.
The 1977—78 period shows a significant response of the

constant dollar trade balance to the depreciation. The current
dollar trade balance did not improve as significantly because of a

67

decline in the terms of trade which stemmed both from the
depreciation and a decline in the price of raw materials relative
to the price of manufactured goods.

4.4 Income distribution
If output prices rise relative to the prices of variable

inputs, profits per unit of output will increase. Since Canada is
a net exporter of resources, a rise in the price of raw materials

relative to wages should increase profits. If the prices of
non—resource—based tradable goods are at least in part related to
foreign prices of such goods, which are in turn related to foreign
unit labour costs, profits will be positively related to the real

exchange rate. This can be derived in a more rigorous manner as

follows. Let P be the GNP deflator. From the nominal gross
national product identity:

(P)(GNP) = PROFITS + WAGES

+ MISCELLANEOUS

MISC
i - PROFITS + WAGES
+

(P)(GNP)
(P)(GNP)

PROFITS ——

W

(P)(GNP)

where W is unit labour costs.

68

Then, if the miscellaneous components to nominal GNP ratio follows
a time trend, a log—linear approximation to the above equation is
provided by

—

bTIME + c(p—w)

= a +

gnp

where small letters represent logarithms and IT is the log

of

real

corporate profits.

The output price is a geometric weighted average of domestic
unit labour costs, foreign unit labour costs (in domestic

currency) and the price of raw materials. Thus

p =

where c' =

Table 5 shows that with increasing relative prices of
tradable goods in Periods I and III, real profits (i.e., in terms

of the GNP deflator) both in manufacturing (as a proxy for
tradable goods) and in the economy as a whole, rose, whereas the
decreasing relative prices in Period III contributed to their

decline.34 The following regression was estimated for 1971
Qi — 1978 Q4:

The signs are correct and the magnitudes in the expected range
(less than one) ,

but

the coefficient on the real exchange rate is

imprecisely estimated.

The movement in the price of raw materials relative to unit
labour costs was the major contributing factor in the increase in
corporate profits from 9.0 percent of GNP in 1970 to 13.6 percent

of GNP in 1974. A worsening of competitiveness (a decrease in the

exchange rate) and a decline in the price of raw materials
relative to unit labour costs caused a decline in corporate
profits to 10.6 percent of GNP in 1976. The depreciation
real

(increase) of the nominal and real exchange rates caused a

recovery of profits to 11.2 percent of GNP in 1978.

4.5 Business fixed investment
In modelling business fixed investment, we first suppose that
the desired capital stock depends on expected output and the

relative prices of capital and labour. We further suppose that
expected output is influenced by the current level and rate of
change

35.

of output and the expected real exchange rate.

It is

Corden (1977) has a good discussion of the effects of a
depreciation on income distribution.

71

likely that the rate of adjustment of the actual capital stock to
the desired capital stock will be influenced by the current rate

of capacity utilization and perhaps a corporate liquidity
variable, such as corporate profits.

Given the large depreciation, both in nominal and real terms
over the 1977—78 period, and the resultant increase in the

production of tradable goods, and therefore, in the rate of
capacity utilization in the tradable goods industry, one would

have expected a significant increase in busines fixed investment

during 1978. However, such investment increased by only 1 percent
in 1978 over 1977, while real corporate profits increased by 14.4
percent, real domestic product (RDP) increased by 3.4 percent, and
the real exchange rate depreciated by 9 percent (see Table 6).

A closer examination (see Table 7) does show that from the
very weak investment level in 1978 Q1, real investment steadily
increased by 8 percent over the course of the next four quarters.

Thus investment has been increasing, but perhaps not as quickly as
one would expect given the depressed level from which it was
starting (only in 1978 Q3 was the 1975 Q3 level surpassed)
In the above sections of the paper we have discussed the

reasons for the depressed state of the tradable goods industry in
1975—76 (and hence of investment in the industry in the 1976—77
period) .

We

now turn to the possible reasons for the slow pick—up

in investment activity after the recovery in tradable goods
production in 1977—78:
(a)

Initially, output is increased through heightened short—run

productivity, then through the hiring of additional labour, and

then through new capital investment.

Rates of capacity utilization in manufacturing did not begin

to pick up significantly until the second quarter of 1978. On an
over—all measure, capacity utilization was not exceptionally high

until the fourth quarter of 1978. Output had risen because of
increases in short—run productivity and the expanded hiring of
workers.

(b) There are long lags from the time of an increase in the
desired stock of capital until the new investment is put into
place.

The severely depressed period that manufacturing industries
had come through in 1976—77 might have meant that expansion plans
were not ready. Much of the machinery and equipment needed is
produced to order and occasionally the waiting times until
delivery can be considerable.
(c)

There is much uncertainty over the permanence of the

depreciation.

Discussions in some quarters concentrate on the effects of
movements in the nominal exchange rate alone on Canada's

competitive position instead of looking at all the factors that

affect the real exchange rate. There may still be a notion that
the Canadian dollar will perhaps return towards parity with the
u.s.

dollar.

If this

were the case then exporters would see their

gains in competitiveness as temporary and potential investment

would not seem as profitable. The longer that the exchange rate
remains at a depreciated level, however, the more likely it is

75

that the depreciation will be looked upon as permanent.

(d) A depreciation may cause a lower desired capital to labour
ratio since a high percentage of machinery and equipment is
imported.

This consideration certainly cannot be overlooked from a
theoretical point of view, but we tend to think that it is
unimportant empirically, relative to the large changes in the
expected profitability of new investment.
(e)

Real corporate profits per unit of output were starting from

a very low level: balance sheets had to be "adjusted" before the
higher profits resulted in increased investment.

There may be more jargon than theory involved here. If
projects are expected to be highly profitable, external financing

can be sought. However, it is true that during times of low
profitability, firms may run down their liquid assets because they

cannot borrow at what they perceive to be reasonable rates. Also,
stock prices were low when profits were low and so debt/equity

ratios increased. A run of profits may be necessary before firms
can return to their desired debt/equity ratio.
Our over—all impression is that, particularly in the light of

the severe profit squeeze faced by the tradable goods industries
in 1975—76, one could expect the lags from the perceived increased

profitability of investment projects to the actual investment to

be long, perhaps longer than normal. This, in addition to any lag
in perception that the real depreciation is indeed likely to be

76

permanent, may be enough to explain the small increase in
investment

activity in 1978.
