INTEGRATION OF THE INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL MARI<ETS:
THE SIZE OF GOVERNMENT AND TAX COORDINATION

ABSTRACT

International-capital market integration has become a key
policy issue in the prospective integration of Europe of 1992.
In this context this paper provides a theoretical analysis of
the effects of relaxing restrictions on the international flow
of capital on the fiscal branch of government:
the optimal

provision of public goods, the structure of taxation and
income redi.sributioa policies.
Concerning issues cf
interdependent economies the paper analyzes the scope of tax
coordination.
with no
The major findings are:
(a)
administrative barriers to capital flows the optimal policy is
to tax income from investment abroad and from investments at
home at the same time; (b) the cost of public funds falls and

the supply of public goods rises if restrictions on
international capital flows are relaxed:

(c) the amount of
income redistrjbutjons increases with the international-

capital market liberalization; (d) some minimal degree of tax

coordination

(such as origin-based or source-based tax

schemes) is essential for the existence of an equilibrium in
an integrated world economy.

I. Introduction
International capital market integration has become the subject of

a major

theoretical

and

practical

Interest in recent times.

Policymakers are becoming more and more aware of the potential benefits

accruing from such integration, which allows more efficient allocations

of investment between the domestic and the foreign market.

In

particular, with the prospective comprehensive integration of capital
markets in Europe in 1992, some key policy issues arise.'

The financial, monetary and exchange rate management

policy

implications of capital market integration have been widely discussed in

the context of the European Monetary System (EMS); see, for instance,
the survey by Micossi (1988). However, capital market integration has

also profound effects on the fiscal branch of each country separately
and on the scope of tax coordination among them. These issues have not

been dealt with extensively so far.

The present paper attempts to

contribute to the economic analysis in this area.2

The opening up of an economy to international capital movements
affects, as expected, the size and the structure of the fiscal branch of

its government.

Capital flows influence both the optimal structure of

taxes, on domestic and foreign-source income, and the welfare cost of
taxation.

As a result, the optimal size of government (the optimal

provision of public goods) and the magnitude of its redistribution
(transfer) policies are affected as well. In this context the paper
analyzes the effects of relaxing restrictions on the international flow
of capital on the fiscal branch of government.

The optimal size of government, or more precisely the optimal

provision of public goods, must be determined by an appropriate

-2-

cost-benefit

analysis. Such analysi rnplies that the marginal cost of

public funds must be equated to the marginal utility from public goods.
Accordingly,

in order to find the effect of liberalization in the

international capital markets on the optimal quantity of public goods we
study here the effect of such a liberalization on the cost of public
funds.

This is done in section V in which we also distinguish between

constant and variable internal terms of

trade

associated with

nontradables.

In calculating the cost of public funds, one must take into account

the optimal response of the structure of taxation (on incomes from all
sources) to the liberalization policy because the cost of public funds

is derived from a process of a tax optimization. Therefore, we also
analyze the effect of liberalization on the structure of taxation.

Of

course, entangled with the structure of taxation is also the issue of
the optimal size of income redistribution.

For this reason we also

analyze in section VI the effect of international capital market
liberalization on the optimal redistribution (transfer) policy of the
government.

Finally, integration of capital markets brings up the issue of
international tax coordination. It turns out that perfect mobility of
capital necessitates some minimal degree of coordination among the tax
authorities. This is discussed in section VII.

We present in section II the analytical framework that serves for

our analysis.

Sections III and IV discuss alternative regimes of

.3-

international capital mobility. Concluding remarks are included in the
final section.

II. The Analytical Framework

Consider a stylized two-period model of a small open economy with

one composite good, serving both for (private and public) consumption

and for investment.

In the first period the economy possesses an

initial endowment of the composite good.

Individuals can decide how

much of their initial endowments to consume in the first period and how

much to save. Saving is allocated to either domestic investment or
foreign investment.

In the second period, output (produced by capital

and labor) and income from foreign investment are allocated between
private and public consumption. For the sake of simplicity, we assume
that the government is active only in the second period. The government

employs taxes on labor, taxes on income from domestic investment, and

taxes on income from investment abroad in order to finance optimally
(taking into account both efficiency and equity considerations) both its

(public) consumption and a (uniform lump-sum) subsidy for redistribution
purposes.

For simplicity, while still capturing real-world basic features, we

assume that government spending on public goods does not affect
individual demand patterns for private goods or the supply of labor.
That is, only the taxes that are needed to finance these expenditures

affect individual demands and supplies, but not the expenditures

-4-

themselves. Formally, this feature is obtained by assuming that the
utility function is weakly separable between private goods and services,

on the one hand, and public goods and services, on the other. That

is,

individual h's utility is:

(1)

uh(clh, C2h, Lh, C) —

where uh and

uh(clh,

mh(G),

C2h, L.a) +

are the private and public components of the utility

function, respectively;

C2h

Clh,

and

L.

are first-period

consumption, second-period consumption and (second-period) labor supply,

respectively; and C is (second-period) public consumption.3
Denote saving in the form of domestic capital by K. and saving in
the form of foreign capital by Bh. The aggregate saving in the form of

domestic capital is equal to the the stock of capital in the second
period, since we assume for concreteness, without affecting the results

of the paper, that the patterns of capital flows are such that the
country is a capital exporter (i.e.

0).

Hence, the budget

constraints of individual h are:

Obviously, in the absence of (quantity) restrictions on capital

flows, individuals must earn the same net return on both forms of
investments, that is r(l-t) —

r* (l-t').

With restrictions on capital

flows the latter equality does not have to hold. In such a case there
is an infra-marginal profit on foreign investment, resulting from the
net interest differential. (This differential is equal to the capital
export tax rate which is equivalent to the quota on capital exports.)

One possibility is for this profit to accrue to the individual
investors. Another possibilty is for the government to fully tax away
this profit. (This is the equivalent capital-export tax version of the
capital-export quota.) We adopt the second possibility, namely that the

government chooses the level of the tax on income from foreign
investments (t') so as to eliminate any infra-marginal profits.

this is an open economy variant of

the aggregate efficiency theorem in optimal tax theory (see Diamond and
Mirrlees (1971), Sadka (1977), and Dixit (1985)).

Notice also that this production-efficiency result implies also

that there should be no differential tax treatment of foreign and
domestic sources of income, namely:

t

—

t'.

-11-

However, in the presence of restrictions on capital exports the
production efficiency result does not necessarily hold: the return to

capital at home may be lower than the net (after foreign taxes only)
return on investment abroad.

We turn next to the study of the effects of relaxing the
restrictions on investments abroad.

V.

The Cost of Public Funds in an Open Economy

In the presence of distortionary taxes, the social cost of an
additional dollar raised by taxes (namely the marginal cost of public

funds) may exceed one dollar, due to the existence of excess-burden
(deadweight loss) of taxation. The optimal provision of public goods is
determined by equating their marginal benefit with the marginal cost of

public funds.

In this section we directly examine the effect of

relaxing the restrictions on B on the optimal level of C.

Since we

C is diminishing (a

concave m), it follows that the optimal G increases if and only if
the marginal cost of public funds declines. Thus, we indirectly analyze

the effect of a liberalization of the international capital markets on
the marginal cost of public funds.

For this purpose, we treat B

To proceed further, at this point, we first abstract

from

redistribution considerations.

1. Efficiency Considerations

Suppose that all individuals are alike so that we may consider a
single representative individual and drop the index h. (Alternatively,

we may assume that redistribution can be done via nondistortionary
means.)

Alleviating the constraint on foreign lending affects the

optimal size of government through two channels. First, increasing

B

generates an additional source of revenues for the government, thereby
allowing lower taxes on existing sources.

This tends to lower the

marginal cost of public funds (and raise the size of government).
Second, increasing B may adversely affect the internal terms of trade

(associated with

nontradable

factors

or goods) for government

expenditures. This effect can raise the marginal cost of public funds
(and lower the size of government). To highlight these two effects we
consider first in the next subsection the pure income effect.

a. Constant internal terms of trade
Assume a linear production function, yielding constant real factor
prices:

capital and labor, respectively. In

-14-

this case we can unambiguously show that N12 >

and consequently,

that dG/dB > 0.
The function N(B,G) is defined in this case by:

From (20):

Similarly, equation (19) (using the envelope theorem) yields

(22)

N1(B,G) — .X(B,C) (r* -

Therefore:

Thus,

(21) implies that

That is, the relaxation of

international capital controls, in the absence of adjustment in the
internal terms of trade, lowers the marginal cost of public funds and
increases the optimal size of government.

b. Variable internal terms of trade

To analyze the effect of variable internal terms of trade on
government's expenditures in a simple manner, we assume that labor, the

nontradable factor of production,

exhibits

diminishing

marginal

productivity and that government's expenditures are used entirely to

hire labor. Specifically, we continue to assume constant internal
intertemporal terms of trade, that is, r is constant (at the level
r). However, in the second period consumption can be provided in that

period (in addition to being transferred from the first period) by a
concave production function, f(L), using labor alone. The rent (pure
profit) generated by such a technology is assumed to be fully taxed by

the government. The government hires LG units of labor in the second

period at the prevailing wage,

w —

f';

the government does not

purchase any quantity of the consumption good. We thus replace G
Lc.

by

-16-

In this case, the function N(B, LG) is defined by:

Following the same procedure as in the preceding subsection, we
conclude that

The first term in the expression for N21 is similar to (21).

before, it is straightforward to show that

As

< 0, so that this term

contributes toward making N21 positive, i.e., to increase the size of
government in response to alleviating controls on foreign lending (see

equation (17)). However, the second term will usually work in the
opposite direction:

the pure income effect of raising B tends to

increase the consuintion of leisure, thereby increasing the cost of labor

that the government hires. Thus, the optimal

LG (namely, the real

magnitude of government's consumption) may at the end decline in
response to a liberalization of the international capital market.

-17-

2. Redistribution Considerations

Now, let us return to the framework of sub-section (la) and
reintroduce the redistribution motive.

To simplify the exposition, suppose that the economy consists of
two individuals (or two classes of individuals), denoted by indices
and

B.

A

We further simplify the analysis by assuming a fixed labor

supply (and dropping it altogether from the model). Thus, we are left
only

with

intertemporal

decisions and tax-induced intertemporal

distortions. Still, to proceed further, we employ a log-linear utility
function, in order to keep the analysis tractable.

To emphasize the equity issues, we consider the extreme case of a

max-mm social welfare criterion, that is, we assume for the social

welfare function in (13) that

The function N, the maximized value of the private component in the

social welfare function W, is defined in this case by:

The first-order condition for t is

H1(t, B, G) —

(27)

0,

while the second-order condition is

H11(t, B, C)

(28)

By the envelope theorem:

N1(B,C) —

Hence, from (29) and (30) we obtain the expression for N12 as
follows.

H12H13 - H23H11

Since H11< 0 (by 28), it follows that

Sign(N12) — Sign(H12 H13 - H23 H11).

(32)

Using the definition of H (namely, equation (26)) to find the
partial derivatives

we substitute these derivatives into (32).

This substitution yields

VI. Tax

Structure

and Redistribution in an Open Economy

In this section we examine the effects of relaxing some of the
controls on international capital flows on the structure of taxation and

the size of redistribution.

We continue to adopt the simplified

framework of subsection V.2. Assume further that public component in

the utility function mG is equal to Slog C.

In this case, the

optimal policy is the solution to the following problem:

Max (H(t, B, C) + SlogG},

(34)

(t,G)

where H(.) is defined in (26).

As before,

B

is a parameter and we consider the relationships

between this parameter and the optimal values of t and C (denoted by
t(B) and C(B), respectively). In doing so, we find also the effect of

changing B on t' and S, as will be shown later.
The

first-order

conditions are:

0,

(35)

H1(t, B, C) —

(36)

H3(t, B, C) + — 0.

Total differentiation of (35)-(36) with respect to B yields:

and
(39)

H12 < 0.

Hence, dt/dB < 0.

Thus, relaxing the controls on investments abroad reduces the
optimal rate of tax on income from domestic investment.

raising B increases the size of the deinogrant S. Again, this result

is natural in view of the fact that relaxing the restrictions on
international capital flows improves the efficiency of total investment,
thereby enabling the economy to devote more resources for redistribution
of income.

The results of the numerical calculations are given in Table 1.

Capital market integration between two large countries brings out
the issue of tax coordination between them.

countries may in general improve the welfare of both countries. In the

case of tax coordination, however, we show that coordination is
essential for a sensible world equilibrium (with nonzero interest rates)
to at all exit.

To highlight this issue, consider a two-country world with perfect
capital mobility. Denote the interest rates in the home country and the
*
foreign country by r and r , respectively. In principle, the home
country may have three different tax rates applying to interest income:

(1) t - the

tax rate levied on domestic residents on their

domestic-source income;
(ii) tRF - the tax rate levied on domestic resident on their foreign-

source income

(iii)tN,

-

the tax rate levied on non-residents on their interest
income in the home country.

The foreign country may correspondingly have three tax rates which we

denote by

and tNRD. Furthermore, let us assume that these

rates apply symmetrically for both interest earned and interest paid
(i.e., full deductibility of interest expenses, including tax rebates).

-24-

A complete integration of the capital markets between the two
countries (including the possibility of borrowing in one country in

order to invest in the other country) requires, due to arbitrage
possiblities, the fulfillment of the following conditions:

(41)

r(l -

t) — r*(l

tNRD) (1 - tRF)

and
(42)

r(l -

tNRD)

(1 -

tRF)

r*(ltD).

—

The first condition applies to the residents of the home country and it

requires that they be indifferent between investing at home or abroad.

Otherwise, they can borrow an infinite amount in the low (net of tax)
interest rate country in order to invest an infinite amount in the high
(net of tax) interest rate country.

The second condition similarly

applies to the residents of the foreign country.

Notice that unless

the only solution to the linear system of equations (41)-(42) is a zero
rate of interest in each country:

r — r*

—

0.

-25-

Thus, some international tax coordination is needed in order to satisfy
(43)

and yield a sensible world equilibrium.
Somewhat

surprisingly, the two most common polar schemes of

source-based or origin-based taxation are examples of workable tax
coordinations (although, by no means globally efficient arrangements)

even when the two countries do not adopt the same scheme.

Consider

first the case in which both countries adopt the source-based tax
scheme.

In this case income is taxed according to its source,

regardless of the origin of the taxpayer. This implies that

(44)

so

that (43) is satisfied and we can have a world equilibrium with

positive rates of interest.

Similarly, consid

the case where both countries adopt the

origin-based tax scheme: income is taxed according to the origin of the

taxpayer, regardless of its source. This Implies that

(45)

so that, again, (43) is satisfied.
Next, consider the case in which one country adopts one tax scheme

while the other adopts another one. Suppose, for instance, that the

home country adopts the origin-based tax scheme, while the foreign

-26-

county adopts the source-based tax scheme. In this case we have

tNRD

and, again, (43) is satisfied.

However, if the two countries do not stick to one or the other of
the two polar schemes, then (43) need not hold in and no sensible world
equilibrium exists. Suppose, for instance, that each country levies the

same tax rate on its residents (irrespective of the source of their
income) and also all non-residents investing in that country. In this
case, we have

Hence, unless (l-t) (1

which is just a sheer

coincidence, condition (43) is violated.

Thus, some tax coordination is essential for a full capital market

integration. Any mutually beneficial tax coordination must satisfy the
tax arbitrage condition (43).

VIII. Conclusion
We

analyzed

in this paper the policy implications of the

integration of the international capital markets. Special attention was

paid to the effects on the marginal cost of public funds, a crucial
factor in the determination of the optimal size of government and the

magnitude of income redistribution. Inherent in the determination of
the cost of public funds is the design of the structure of taxation (on
labor income, domestic-source capital income and foreign-source capital
income).

In the context of a world economy with integrated capital markets,
there arises the issue of international tax coordination.

has two aspects.

This issue

First, the elementary problem of what international

tax arrangements are at all viable in the wake of capital market
arbitrage possiblities.

This issue was dealt with in this paper. A

second, yet to be investigated, aspect is the determination of mutually

beneficial international tax arrangements from the set of viable
arrangements.

APPENDIX A

In this appendix we prove that N(B, C) is concave.

Recall that

N(B, C) is defined by (19). Since there is only one individual and a

lump-sum tax/subsidy is allowed, it follows that the government can
choose any bundle (C1, C2, L) which is feasible (i.e., which satisfies

the resource constraint in (19)). Thus, N may be equivalently defined
by

N(B, C) —

By being solutions to optimum problems, the bundles (C1, C2, L)

and (C;i C, L) satisfy the constraint in (Al), namely:

FOOTNOTES

In a recent paper Micossi (1988) provides a succint survey of the

proposed institutional arrangements for

the

1992

Europoean

integration. He writes:
"The European integration entails the elimination of restrictions
and
administrative
and discriminatory regulations
practices
the
right
of
establishment
and acquisition of
(i)
concerning:
financial
participations by foreign institutions in domestic
markets;
(ii)
permitted operations of foreign-controlled
financial institutions;
(iii) cross-border
transactions
in
financial services.
The first two items basically involve the

freedom to supply services in EC national markets, the third, the
freedom to move capital throughout the Community."

For

an earlier discussion of the interaction among taxes,

government consumption, and international capital flow, see Razin
and Svensson (1983).

To ensure diminishing marginal rates of substitution between
private and public commodities we assume, as usual, that uh

and

mh are strictly concave.

An equivalent policy to taxing away the infra-marginal profits
(resulting from the net interest differential) is to auction off
the quotas on investment abroad.

The reader who is familiar with the optimal income tax literature
may realize that the issue of the sign of dã/dB is related to the

issue of the concavity of the maximized (reduced-form) social
welfare function with respect to tax revenues; see Balcer and
Sadka (1982) and Stiglitz (1982).

The derivative dÔ/dB is negative as shown in section V.2.
