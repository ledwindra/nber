Aggregate Savings in the Presence of Private and Social Insurance
ABSTPJCT

In

the presence of uncertain lifetimes, social security has the

characteristics of an annuity: a consumer pays a tax when young in exchange
for receiving a social security benefit if he survives to be old. If
consumers have identical ex ante mortality probabilities, then a fully
funded social security system would offer a rate of return equal to the
actuarially fair rate available on competitively supplied private annuities.
In this case fully funded social security would be a redundant asset and
would have no effect on consumption or national saving.
In this paper, consumers have different (publicly known) ex ante

mortality probabilities and consequently can buy actuarially fair private

annuities offering different rates of return. If the social security system
does not discriminate on the basis of cx ante mortality probabilities, then
the introduction of social security induces a redistribution of income
from consumers with a high probability of dying young to consumers with a low

probability of dying young. Under homothetic utility this redistribution
reduces aggregate bequests and aggregate consumption of young consumers in the
steady state; the steady state national capital stock can either increase

or decrease. If consumers display at least as much risk aversion as the
logarithmic utility function, then average steady state welfare is increased
by the introduction of fully funded social security.

Introduction
Over the last decade there has been a lively debate over the effects

of social security on consumption and capital accumulation. This debste has
distinguished between a pay-as-you—go social security system and a fully

funded social security system. A balanced-budget pay-as-you-go systei
levies taxes on young consumers and uses the tax

revenue to pay

the social

security benefits of old consumers. In a standard overlapping generations
model

in which

consumers have no bequest motive (e.g. Diamond (1965)), the

saving of young consumers is reduced both by the tax they pay when they
are
(and

young and

by the benefit they receive when they are old. Thus, the private

national) capital stock is reduced by the introduction of pay—as-you—go

social security (See Feldstein (1974)). However, if consumers obtain
utility from the utility of their heirs, as well as from their own cor.su.mDtion,

then the introduction of
consumption

or

pay-as-you-go social security will not affect

private capital accumulation; as shown by Barro (1974),

consumers will adjust their bequests in order to offset the lump-sum
intergenerational transfers imposed by the social security system.
In contrast to pay—as-you-go social security, the introduction of

fully funded social security has no effect on

consumption or the national

capital stock, regardless of whether or not consumers have bequest motives.
The reason for the irrelevance of fully funded social security is that the
implicit rate of return on social security is the same as the rate of return

on private wealth. Consumers will offset an increase in social security
taxes and benefits by reducing private saving while maintaining unchanged
consumption.
In

order for fully funded social security to affect consumption and

the national capital stock, the rate of return on social security must differ

—2—

from the rate of return on privately traded assets. If consumers have
random dates of death, then a social security system which taxes young
consumers and gives benefits only to consumers who survive to old age has the

characteristics of an annuity. The gross rate of return on this publicly
provided non-tradable annuity will exceed the rate of return on private

assets which are not contingent on survival. If there is no private annuity
market, and if

consumers

have no

bequest

motive, then the introduction

of fully funded social security reduces the steady state national cajital ztock

and narrows the distribution of wealth (See Abel (l985a)). However, if
there were a competitive annuity market, then the rate of return on private
annuities would equal the rate of return on social security and hence social

security uld have no effect.

If, as in actual

practice, the social

security systen does

discriminate across individuals in a cohort according to the probability

of death, then social security has real effects under two alternative

information structures. First, if annuity companies know the ex ante mortality
probability of each individual, then a competitive annuity market will
provide annuities with different rates of return to consumers with different

mortality probabilities. Clearly, in such a case, some individuals must
face different rates of return on private annuities and on social security.
In general, the consumption and investment decisions of these people will

be affected by changes in social security. Alternatively, if an individual's
ex ante mortality probability is private information observable only by that
individual, then heterogeneity introduces adverse selection into the private

annuity market. However,the social security system is immune to the problem

—3—

of adverse selection because of the compulsory nature of social security

taxes and benefits. Again, for at least some consumers, the rate of return
on social security differs from that on private annuities so that the consumptior
arid

portfolio

decisions of these people are affected by changes in the level

of

social security. In

of

information

this paper, I assume the first structure

i.e., public information; in a companion paper (Abel (1985b))

I make the alternative assumption of private information.
In order to analyze the effects of social security on steady
state welfare, it is not sufficient to determine the effect on the steady
state capital stock, especially in an economy with heterogeneous consumers.
The effects

on the

aggregate capital stock and aggregate welfare can be in

opposite directions for two reasons: first, well-known Golden Rule
considerations

stock

imply that aggregate consumption and the aggregate capital

can move in opposite directions; second, and more importantly, it will

be shown that social security narrows the steady state cross-sectional
distribution of consumption which tends to increase average steady state
welfare.

Much of the existing literature on uncertain lifetimes examines the
consumption

and portfolio behavior of an individual, taking as given any

wealth received by the individual in the form of bequests.1 In the next
two sections of this paper, I also analyze the individual consumer's decision

problem. In section II, I state and solve the consumption and portfolio
decision problem of a consumer who lives for either one period or two periods
and who can hold his wealth in the form of riskless bonds and actuarially

fair annuities. As a step toward analyzing the aggregate behavior of heterogeneous consumers, I show in section III that consumption and bequests are

increasing functions of expected lifetime wealth. In addition, for a given
value of expected lifetime wealth, consumption and bequests are increasing

—4—

functions of the probability of dying young.
After examining individual behavior, I then analyze steady state
behavior allowing for the eridogenous adjustment of bequests using an
extension to uncertain lifetimes of the Modigliani-Bruxnberg (1954) -

Samuelson (1958) - Diamond (1965) overlapping generations model. Previously,
Abel (1985a,b), Eckstein, Eichenbaurn and Peled (1985) and Sheshinski and Weiss

(1981) have examined uncertain lifetimes in an overlapping generations

framework. Sheshinski and Weiss (1981) assumed that all consumers in a
given cohort have identical ex post mortality experiences whereas Abel
(1985a,b) and Eckstein, Eichenbaum and Peled (1985) allow for consumers with
the same ex ante mortality probabilities to have different mortality

experiences ex post. By allowing ex post mortality experiences to differ, these
models generate intra-cohort variation in bequests and have implications

for the intergenerational transmission of inequality. In this paper, I allow
for different ex post mortality experiences, but the presence of actuarially

fair annuities eliminates the intra—cohort variation in bequests received
and left by members of a given cohort with identical ex ante mortality
2

probabilities.
In section IV, I analyze steady state consumption and bequest
behavior and present sufficient conditions for the existence of a unique
steady

state. Then I demonstrate that the steady state values of consumption

and bequests are higher for families with a high probability of dying young.

In addition, I
intra—cohort

show

that fully funded social security narrows the steady-state

distributions of consumption and bequests. In section V1 I

restrict the analysis

funded

to homothetic utility functions and show that fully

social security reduces steady state aggregate bequests and steady

state aggregate consumption of young consumers. The steady state aggregate
private capital stock is crowded out by a degree greater than, equal to,

—5—

or less than one-for-one depending on whether the steady state consumption
of young consumers is less than,

greater

than, or equal to the inheritances

received. Then in section VI, I show that if utility function is sufficiently
concave (more concave than logarithmic utility), then average steady state
welfare is increased by the introduction of fully funded social security.

-6-

ConsumrtiOfl and Portfolio Behavior of an Individual

In this section we analyze the consumption and portfolio behavior

of an individual consumer who does not know when he will die. We show that
f the consumer can buy actuarially fair annuities, and if the utility
from leaving a bequest is independent of the consumer's date of death,

then the consumer will leave the same

bequest

whether he dies young or old.

Furthermore, as shown by Sheshinski and Weiss (1981), the consumer will
hold riskless bonds to provide for his bequests and will hold annuities to
provide for consumption when old.
Consider consumers with the following life-cycle of events:

At birth, each consumer receives an initial inheritance I from his parent.
During the first period of his life the consumer earns a fixed labor
income Y, pays a social security tax (T<Y) and consumes an

amount c1. At

the end of the first period, the consumer selects a portfolio to carry his

wealth, I+Y-T-c1, to the next period. There are two assets: an actuarially
fair annuity and a riskless bond. One unit of output invested in the
annuity yields A units of output to the consumer if the consumer survives
to the second period; if the consumer dies after one period, his estate

receives nothing from the annuity. Let Q denote the number of units of
output

that the consumer invests in an annuity. The consumer invests the

remainder of his wealth 14-Y-T-c1—Q in a riskless bond which pays a gross

rate of return R to the

At the beginning of the second period, the consumer gives birth

to G>l children. There is a probability p

that

the consumer dies at the

beginning of the second period after giving birth to G heirs. If the
consumer dies at the beginning of the second period, each of his heirs

—7—

receives a bequest BD/G, where ED is equal to the consumer's riskiess
bonds with accrued interest,

If the consumer survives in the second period, he receives a
social security payment S (5>0) in addition to the principal and interest on

his portfolio of bonds and annuities. The consumer then consumes an
amount c2 and gives the remainder of wealth, BS, to his heirs, where

second period, the consumer dies. Because we have

assumed that the consumer does not live beyond the second period, all uncertainty

is resolved at the beginning of the second period. Therefore, the bequest,
BS, can be given to the consumer's heirs at the beginning of the second period,

i.e.,

at the beginning of the first period of his heirs' lives. Thus, we can

assume, as stated above, that all inheritances are received at birth.3
The consumer's utility function is assumed to be additively separable.
In particular, the utility function is specified as
U(c1) + (l—p)6U(c2) + p5V(BD) +

(l—p)V(B5)

where ó>o is the one—period discount factor, U( )

is

(3)

the utility index of the

consumer's own consumption and V( ) is the index of utility derived from

leaving a bequest. We assume that U( ) and V( ) are strictly concave and
satisfy the Inada conditions urn tJ'(c) =

V'(B) and lini U'(c) = 0 =

The utility function in (3) can be viewed simply as the expected value of utility

—8—

where the only uncertain element is the consmer's date of death. Since the
utility function is a function of the bequest left to the consumer's heirs, it
is an example of what Yaari (1965) has called a "Marshall utility function".4'5
The consumer's optimization problem is to maximize (3) subject to (1)

and (2). Substituting (1) and (2) into (3) and then differentiating with
respect to C1, C2, and Q, respectively, yields

The strict concavity of V( ) then implies that BD = BS.

Let B = ED = BS

and (2) that

c2=QA+S
Thus, in the presence of a market for actuarially fair annuities,
annuities are used to provide for second-period consumption and riskiess
bonds are used to provide for bequests, and shown by Sheshinski and Weiss

(7)

—9—

(1981). The interpretati.on of (7) that second-period consumption is

equal to the payoffs from annuities recognizes that the social security
payment S is contingent on survival and thus is appropriately viewed as

an annuity. It is clear from (7) that if the social security benefit S is
less than second-period consumption c2, the consumer will hold a positive

amount of annuities. Alternatively, if S is greater than c2, then the

would want a negative position in annuities. If actuarially fair
-life insurance (which pays a gross rate of return to the consumer's estate

The Effects of Changes in the Probability of Death and Changes in Wealth

In

probability

this section we calculate the effects of variation in the
of death and variation in expected lifetime wealth on consumption

and portfolio decisions. We will show that consumption at each age and
bequests are increasing functions of the expected present value of lifetime

wealth. Also, for a given level of expected lifetime wealth, consumption at
each age and the amount of bequests are increasing in p. These results will
be useful in later sections when we aggregate over consumers with different
probabilities of dying.
The income expansion path is easily derived from (4a,b) and (6)

U'(c1) = fSRV'(B) =

RU'(c2)

The strict concavity of U( ) and V( ) implies that

(8)

dc2 >
0

and dB

> 0

along

1

the income expansion path. Furthermore, because consumers can buy actuarially
fair annuities, the income expansion path is independent of p.
The choice of c1, c2 and B is constrained by a lifetime budget

constraint. Using (1), (2), (5) and the fact that B = BS = BD, the lifetime
budget constraint can be written as7

c1 + (l—p)R1c2 + R1B =

W

(9)

where W E I + Y - T + (l-p)R1S.
According to (9), the expected present value of lifetime purchases (of

consumption and of bequests) is equal to expected lifetime wealth. The
optimal values of c1, c2, and B are determined by the intersection of the
income expansion path in (8) and the lifetime budget constraint in (9).

Given the fixed value of R, the optimal values of c1, c2, and B can

each be expressed as functions of W and p. Clearly, c1, c2 and B are each

—"-

increasing functions of W. As for the effect of an increase in p,
note that if some bundle (c1, C2, B) satisfies (9), then an increase in
p holding W constant will make the relevant expected present value of

purchases on the left hand side of (9) smaller than W. Hence, c1, C2,
and B will all be increased along the expansion path until the budget

line (9) is satisfied. Therefore,we have

c.(W,p);

B = B(W, p);

-

(iDa)

(lOb)

We have shown that the partial effect of an increase in p, holding w constant,
is to increase c1, c2, arid B. However, since W =

I

+ '

-T

+ (l-p)R is,

an increase in p will, if S > 0, decrease W and tend to offset the increases

in c1, c2, and W. Of course, if S = 0, then this offsetting effect is absent.
In general, the total effect of an increase in p is to increase (decrease)
c1, C2, and B if S is less (greater) than c2. If S = C2, then the consumer
holds no private annuities or life insurance and the optimal values of c1, C2,
and B are invariant to p.
in addition to determining the qualitative effect of W on E as above,

it will be useful to calculate the magnitude of this effect. Totally
differentiating the lifetime budget constraint (9) with respect to c1, c2,
B and W yields

IV. The Steady State Cross-Sectional Distributions of Consumption and Bequests
In this section we demonstrate that if R<G, then there exists a
unique positive steady state

level

of bequests. It is well-known from the

Golden Rule literature that R<G characterizes a dynamically inefficient
steady state, and hence we would also like to analyze steady state behavior

under the alternative assumption that R>G. However, if R>G, then the
existence of a positive steady state level of bequests depends on the
parameters of the utility function as well as on R and G; we defer
discussion of the existence of a positive steady state level of bequests
with R>G until section V where we restrict attention to homothetic utility.
However, before restricting the utility function to be homothetic, we are
able to show in this section that the introduction of fully funded social
security narrows the steady state distributions of consumption and bequests.
In

previous sections we derived the optimal consumption and

portfolio behavior of an individual with probability p of dying after
period.

Henceforth, we assume that all descendents of an individual face

the same probability p as the
of

individual.

However, we allow for

p across members of the same cohort and we index

consumer

if

his probability of an early death is equal to p. In

order to rule out a known date of death, we assume that 0 < p <

1.

Let H(p)

be the fraction of consumers in each cohort who have a probability of

early death less than or equal to p. Let

p be the population average

probability of early death so that p =

I pdH (p). In order to rule out

aggregate uncertainty, we assume that a fraction p of type p consumers does

indeed die early. Thus p is the fraction of consumers of each cohort who die
early.

Since each consumer has G children, the assumption that a consumer's

—14—

bequest is divided equally among his heirs implies that I =

B/G.

(The

consumer born in period t receives an inheritance I and leaves a total

bequest B.) Using (lOb) it follows that the sequence of bequests in a
family with a given probability of dying, p, evolves according to the first-

order nonlin€ar difference eution

A steady state level of bequests, B*, must satisfy the difference

B. Below we specify a siTnjle sufficient

equation (14) with

condition for the existence of a unique positive steady state level of
bequests.

Proposition 1. If R<G, then there exists a unique steady state
level of bequests B*>O.

Proof. Existence: Since urn V' (B) =, the optimal bequest is

Therefore, since Y — T + A'S>O,

if B=O, then Bt>Bti. Observe from (9) that, setting I =

exceeds R(Y-T+A1S) for sufficiently large Bt1. Therefore, for large
enough Bt1 the right hand side of (16) is positive and hence Bt<Bti.
Since Bt= B((Bu/G) + Y—T+A1S,p) is a continuous function, there exists
some B*>0 such that B* =

B(B*/G+Y_T+A'S,p).

q.e.d.

To establish the existence of a unique steady state when R>G we

need some additional restrictions on the utility function. We postpone
the analysis of this case until section V when we introduce homothetic

utility. The following useful proposition allows us to characterize the
steady state cross-sectional distributions of consumption and bequests. Note
that it does not require R<G.

Proposition 2. If there exists a unique positive steady state level
of bequests, then B/aW<G when evaluated in the steady state.

Proof. Since urn V'(B)=°, it follows that if BtiO then Bt>B1=O.

We can now compare the steady state behavior of families with

different probabilities of dying young. We begin by comparing bequests.
Let B*(p) denote the steady state level of bequests for a type p family.

the social security payment S>O is sufficiently small, then dB*(p)/dp>O.

the coefficient of dB* in (20) is positive. Recall from (lob) that 2. > o

Therefore dB*/dp>O.

q.e.d.

One may be tenpted to explain Proposition 3 by arguing that an
increase in p is an increase in the frequency with which people die

young leaving large bequests. However, we have shown that with a market
for actuarially fair annuities, consumers leave the same bequest whether

they die after one period or after two periods. The explanation for
Proposition 3 is that, provided S is small, an increase in p reduces the
expected present value of expenditures on the left side of the budget constraint

(9) for given values of c1, c2, and B. Provided that s>o is small, (in
particular, if S<c2), the reduction in expected expenditure exceeds the
reduction in expected lifetime wealth on the right hand side of (9)

,

thereby

permitting the consumer to increase C1, C2 and B. This reasoning suggests
the following Corollary.

We now consider a fully funded social security system. In such
a system, the total benefits to a cohort are eaual to the return on the

system's investment of that cohort's contribution. We will limit our
attention to a social security system which does not discriminate on the

bsis of an individual's probability of dying early.8 Therefore,in an
actuarially fair system, the taxes and benefits satisfy
RT = (l—p)S.

It follows from (5) and (21) that the expected net present value of social

the

introduction of fully funded social security increases

the expected lifetime wealth of consumers with a low p (less than p) and
decreases the expected lifetime wealth of consumers with a high p (greater

than p). The effects on the steady state distributions of consumption and
bequests are given by the following proposition.

Proposition 4. Suppose that there exists a unique positive steady

The intuition underlying Proposition 4 is quite straightforward.

For

consumers

with a low probability of dying early, the annuity offered

-19—

by social security system has a rate of return,

,

which exceeds the

rate of return available from private annuity companies

.

Thus

an increase in social security effectively raises the wealth of the ccrsuxriers

with p <

p.

Hence these consumers increase consumption and bequests.

As for consumers with p >

P'

an increase in social security forces them

to hold annuities with a lower rate of return than on annuities in the
private market; for these consumers, an increase in T effectively lowers wealth

and leads to a reduction in bequests and consumption. Finally observe that for
consumers with p=p, an increase in social security has no effect since these
consumers can undo the effects of an increase in social security by reducinc
their holdings of private annuities.
In Abel (1985a) it was also shown that an increase in the level of
actuarially fair social security will narrow the steady state distributions

of bequests and consumption. It is worth noting how Proposition 4 differs
from the result in Abel (l985a) .

In

the previous paper, there are no

annuity markets, no bequest motive and no heterogeneity of ex ante mortality

probabilities. In the model presented there, all bequests are "accidental";
bequests are equal to the wealth of consumers who die after one period.
The introduction of social security reduces the need to save for retirement
consumption and thus reduces the siz.e of accidental bequests. Since all
)r4tra—cohort variation is due to intra-cohort variation in becuests,

the reduction in all positive bequests reduces intra—cohort variation.

However, in the current paper with actuarially fair annuities, consumers

V.

The Effects of Social Security on Steady Statc Aggregate Capital and
S urn

t ion

Much of the literature on the effects of social security has focussed

effects

on its

on

the

long-run aggregate capital stock. Presumably the

reason for examining the effects on the capital stock is that if the long—

run

capital

stock is below

the

Golden Rule capital stock, then if social

security reduces the long-run aggregate capital stock, it will also reduce

long-run aggregate consumption. The implication of the reduction in aggregate
consumption is evidently that aggregate welfare is reduced. We argue in this
section and the next section that, for two reasons, the emphasis on the long-run
capital stock is misplaced if one is actually interested in Social welfare.
First, as is well-known from the Golden Rule literature, the long-run aogregate
capital

stock and long-run

directions

aggregate consnption can xve in opposite

in response to social security. Second, and zrre inortantly,

with heterogeneous consuners, it can happen
reduced

that aggregate consuntion is

but aggregate welfare is increased by social security. This

apparent contradiction can be explained by observing that social security
narrows the

distribution

of consumption.

We restrict our attention henceforth to

the case of homothetic utility

as in Hakansson (1969), Fischer (1973), and Richard (1975) .

There are two

reasons for restricting the utility function to be hornothetic. First, we can
present necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a unique

steady state which do not require R<G. Second, homothetic utility implies
linear decision rules which are easily aggregated.

Note that U( ) and V( )

are

each strictly concave and satisfy the Inada

conditions. Therefore, Propositions 1—4 apply to this specificationof
the utility function.

Homothetic utility is particularly convenient because it implies that
the income expansion path is a ray through the origin. Using (28a,b) ,

the

income expansion path in (8) can be expressed as

it follows from (13b) and (29a,b) that 4(p) in (3Db) is simply

(p, c1, c2, B) evaluated under the assumption of homothetic utility. In
this

case,

'(p, c1, c2, B) is independent of C1, c2, and B and is simply

a decreasing function of p. Recall from the proof of Proposition 1 that

the steady state will be unique if G>l. The analogous result for homothetic
utility is given below.

Proposition 5. Suppose that U( )

and

V( )

have

equal constant

degrees of relative risk aversion as specified in (28a,b) .

There will

be a unique positive steady state level of bequests, B*(p), if and only if

G(p)>1, where (p) is defined in (3Db).
Proof. Setting I equal to B/G in (3Da) yields

B*(p) =

funded social security decreases aggregate bequests and aggregate consumption

of young consumers in the steady state. The steady state national capital
stock will be increased or decreased depending on whether consumption of

the young is greater or less than the inheritance they receive. Whether
aggregate consumption in the steady state increases or decreases depends on
whether the interest rate exceeds the growth rate as well as whether the

consumption

of the young is greater or less than the inheritance they

receive.

Suppose that U( ) and V( ) have equal constant

relative risk aversion as specified in (28a,b) and that G(p)>l for all
p in the support of H(p). Then an increase in fully funded social security
reduces aggregate bequests in the steady state4 B**.

B. Steady State Consurnption
Now we examine the effects on aggregate consumption of consumers of

each age. The steady state aggregate (per capita) consumption of the
1

young cohort is c1 E1c1*(p)dH(p). Since the ratio of c1 to B is f3] for
all consumers, it follows immediately that

=

e1B

(33)

Equation (33) and Proposition 6 lead to

Proposition 7. Under the assumptions of Proposition 6, an increase
in fully funded social security reduces the aggregate consumption of the
young.
Although social security unambiguously reduces the steady state

consumption

of

the young, it can either reduce, raise, or leave unchanged

the steady state aggregate consumption of the old cohort. To understand
why the effect on the consumption of the old is ambiguous, recall that,
in the long run, social security raises both the first-period and
second-period consumption of consumers with p<p and reduces the first-

period and second-period consumption of consumers with p>. Consumers with
p<p represent a larger share of the old generation than of the young

generation because of their higher survival rates. Thus, even though

—25-

average first-period consumption is unambiguously reduced in the long

run, it is possible for average second—period consumption to be incxeaseó
in the long run.

C. The Steady State Cpital Stock
Let K*(p) be the steady state capital stock of type p consumers and
1

K** f K*(p)dH(p) be the aggregate steady state private capital stock. We
will measure K** at the end-of-period, that is, before interest is accrued.
At the end of a period, all privately owned capital is held by young
consumers; the surviving old consumers have already consumed c2 and have

already given the remaining wealth to their heirs. Thus, the private capital
stock is equal to inheritances received by the young, I**, plus net labor

To interpret the condition in (40) and (41), observe that since

c1** = O1B** and B**= GI**, we have c1**=G011**. ThaTt is, in comparing
steady states, GO1 is the response of consumption of young consumers to

changes in the inheritances they receive. The introduction of fully funded
social security reduces B** and hence reduces I** and c1**. If GO1 is less
than 1, the reduction in first period consumption is smaller than the

reduction in inheritances and the national capital stock falls. Alternativey,

if GO1 is greater than 1, the reduction in c1 exceeds the reduction in
inheritances and the national capital stock rises.

It is useful at this point to present the aggregate resource constraint

of the economy. In the steady state, the aggregate disposable resources
of the private sector are given by Y + (R/G)K** + (l—p)S/G - T where Y - T
is the net labor income of the young, (R/G)K** is the per capita gross
income accruing to privately-held capital carried over from the previous
period, and (l-p)S/G is the per capita social security income of the old.

The private sector uses these resources for consumption c**Ec** +

the net rate of return to capital is greater than, less than, or equal to
the population growth rate.

It is not obvious how one might best choose an estimate for the crucial

parameter 0 in the two-period lifetime model presented above. However,
I will offer a casual guess without pretending it is anything more than a guess.
As is clear from Proposition 9 and its Corollaries, the critical value of

consumption of the young to aggregate inheritances received at birth, a
reasonable guess is that the bequest motive is sufficiently weak so that

this ratio is greater than one, which implies that 01>G')3 In addition,
it appears that the marginal product of capital is greater than the populaticn

growth rate so that R1<G1. As is clear from Figure 1, these two guesses irn1y
that the national capital stock, consumption of the old, and aggregate
consumption are all increased by fully funded social security, whereas
aggregate bequests and aggregate consumption of the young are decreased.

VI.

Steac,y State Welfare

In this section, we examine the effect of an increase in social

security on the steady state level of aggregate welfare. Our measure
of aggregate welfare is simply the sum of the individual utilities of

all consumers in a given cohort. We demonstrate that if consumers are
sufficiently risk-averse, then the introduction of social security will
increase steady state aggregate welfare.

Let (p) be the maximized value of the individual utility
function (3) subject to the constraints in (1) and (2) .

Restrictin

U( ) and V( ) to have equal constant relative risk aversion as in

(28a,b) , we can use the income expansion path in (29a,b) to obtain

It is clear from (45) that

an

for a given p steady state welfare Q*(p) is

increasing function of the steady state bequest B*(p). Therefore, in view

of Proposition 4, an increase in fully funded social security increases steady
state utility for consumers with p<p and reduces steady state utility for
consumers with p>p.
To examine the effects of social security on social welfare, we

of course, need to specify a social welfare function. We use a utilitaria
social welfare function which is the sum of the utility of all consumers

in a given cohort. The steady state level of social welfare

Then the introduction of actuarially fair social security

—33-.

We have shown that the introduction of actuarially fair social security
can reduce steady state aggregate consumption but, if the CRRA

utility

functions U( ) and \T( ) display at least as much risk aversion as the

logarithmic utility function, it increases steady state social welfare.

Although a reduction in aggregate consumption may seem, at first, to be
inconsistent with an increase in social welfare, these results are

easily reconciled by the observation that social security reduces the

variation in bequests and consumption (Proposition 4). If the individual
utility functions are

sufficiently

risk averse, the welfare-improving

effects of reduced variance outweigh the welfare-reducing effects of
reduced aggregate consumption.

Corollary 10.1 indicates that if the coefficient of relative
risk aversion is greater than or equal to one, then the welfare-improving
effects of reduced variance are strong enough to raise social welfare.
Alternatively, if the coefficient of relative risk aversion is sufficiently
small, then the introduction of social security will reduce steady state

welfare. A sufficient condition is given in the following corollary.
Corollary

Conclusion
The social security system essentially forces all workers to hold an

annuity

in their portfolios. If the rate of return on this annuity is equal

to the rate of return on the private annuities which a consumer holds, then

the

can offset the effects of social security simply by reducing his

consumer

holding of private annuities. However, if the rate of return on social
security differs from the rate available to the consumer in the private annuity

market, then changes in the level of social security will, in general, force
the consumer to change his cons urrtion

portfolio behavior. Thus,
in a world in which consumers all face the same rate of return on social
security

and/or

but face different rates of return

on private annuities, changes

in social security will affect the behavior of at least some individuals.
In this paper, we have assumed that each consumer can

annuities

buy private

at an actuarially fair rate of return. After presenting sufficient

conditions for the existence of a unique steady state equilibrium, we
then established that increased social security narrows the steady state

distributions of bequests and consumption. We showed that fully funded
social security will crowd out steady state private wealth by more than,
less than, or exactly one-for-one depending on whether steady state
consumption of the young is less than, greater than, or equal to steady state

inheritance received by the young. We also established simple conditions
which determine whether steady state aggregate consumption rises, falls,

or remains unchanged. Finally, we showed that if individual utility functions
are sufficiently risk—averse, then fully funded social security increases
steady state social welfare because it reduces inequality; however, if
individual utility functions display very little risk-aversion, then social
welfare is reduced by social security.

4. We follow Yaari (1965), Hakansson (1969), Fischer (1973) and Richard (1975)

in

specifying utility as a function of the size of the bequest left

to one's heirs. An alternative formulation which gives rise to a
bequest motive is to specify utility as a function of the utility of one's
heirs' as in Barro (1974)

5. More generally we might specify the utility of bequests as a function V(B,G)
where B is the size of the total bequests and each child receives B/G.
However, since G is assumed to be fixed exogenously, we can write the
utility of bequests simply as a function of B.
