ostensibly been guided by the principle of equal wages with comparable

private sector jobs. To accomplish this goal, the Bureau of Labor
Statistics

(BLS) annually conducts a survey of wages of white collar jobs

in private sector establishments,

and based upon this survey a

Presidential Commission recommends across the board wage adjustments to
bring about equality between federal and private sector wages. Recently,
the comparability process has been severely criticized, and alternative

measures for guiding federal pay have been proposed.1 Host notably, the
U.S. Office of Personnel Hanagement

(OPM) has proposed analyzing

data on

turnover and application rates to adjust federal wages.2 If high quit
rates or low application

rates make it difficult to attract, retain and

motivate the federal workforce, wages would be adjusted accordingly.
Linking wage rates to the governments ability to attract and retain
competent employees has the appeal of reflecting the underlying implicit
job queue, and thus appears consistent with cost minimizing behavior.
Furthermore,

unlike the wage survey approach, these measures have the

virtue of reflecting workers' evaluations of nonwage compensation, such
as fringe benefits, job security and working conditions. As a matter of
practice,

turnover and application information are already used by the

off-scale

(1976, 1977), Quinn (1979),Venti (1986), Tracy and Gyourko (1986)
Krueger (1987) find that after controlling for observed and unobserved
worker characteristics federal wages exceed private wages by as much as
15% to 20%.

wage rates for a small proportion of federal joba.

A precise

understanding of the determinants of turnover and job applications is
necessary if this approach is to be effectively used to set wages for
federal workers on a wide scale.

Although there is a relatively large literature on turnover,
surprisingly little is known about the determinants of applicants for job
openings

in the public or private sectors.3

There are many questions

that one would want to answer before using application rates as an input
in wage determination.

For instance, does the application rate depend on

the differential

in wages and fringe benefits between federal and private

sector workers?

Do macroeconomic factors such as unemployment affect the

rate of job applicants?

How does the average quality of job applicants

vary with wagea and macroeconomic conditions?

This paper analyzes a new

collection of time-series and cross-sectional

data to examine the

determinants of applicants for federal jobs.

Section one of the paper

is presented.

The empirical results that are presented in section three support a
conclusion that the application rate for federal jobs is very responsive
to relative federal-private

sector wages and macroeconomic

conditions,

but does not appear to be related to the relative level of nonwage
compensation.

See Long (1982), Utgoff (1983), Mussel (1986), Ippolito (1987) and
Black, Moffitt and Warner (1987) for comparative studies of turnover in
the federal and private sectors. See Barron and Bishop (1986), Dc Vany
and Saving (1981), and Holzer, Katz and Krueger (1988) for contributions

The Federal Job Application Process
In 1985 the federal government received about 4.5 million requests

for information regarding job openings, processed nearly 1.2 million
completed job applications from individuals who were not employed by the
government, and hired 134,224 new employees.4

Below I consider the

system that generates and processes applications for federal jobs.
For the majority of job openings, agencies hire workers from outside
the federal government through the Office of Personnel Management's Open
Competitive Appointment System.
its Area Offices.

This system is administered by OPM and

When it is decided that a position should be filled by

an outside employee, OPM advertises the job opening in its Job
Information Centers, specifies the minimum qualifications needed to
perform the job, and announces the job's starting salary.

In its

instructions to job applicants, OPM advises potential applicants not to
apply for a job unless they "fully meet the qualification requirements,
will work in the location(s) for which applications are being accepted
and will accept the salary of the position." This process is intended to
screen out applicants who are not qualified for the position.
Applications are accepted only for the specific positions that have
job openings. However, for many occupations, including most clerical,
engineering, nursing and accounting jobs, there is a continual need for
new hires, so applications are accepted on an on-going basis.
Individuals may submit an application for more than one job opening.

These data and the subsequent data used in the paper are based on
workers hired through the competitive appointment system which excludes
postal workers.

Job applicants are evaluated on the basis of this informs-

federal "registers'

for each occupation. OP1 then refers a list of the

eligible applicants ranked in order of their qualifications to the
specific agency that has a job vacancy. The agency must select a
candidate from the three most highly rated job applicants on the
register.
Applications typically remain active on the register for a period of
12 months.

After the 12 month period expires, however, the applicant may

request to have his or her name remain active on the register for an
additional year.

Thus, the registers mainly contain applicants who

currently desire government employment.
After 1978, in cases where a specific agency or local area is the
sole or predominant employer of an occupation, OPM may delegate complete
responsibility for recruitment and hiring to the agency or area.

By

1985, about one-third of federal job applications that were processed and

selections that were made were delegated to individual agencies and local
areas.

Examples of occupations that OPM has delegated include air

traffic controllers (delegated to the Federal Aviation Authority) and
ship-fitters (delegated to local federal ports).
The data used in this paper are drawn from the lists of applications
maintained by OPM and its predecessor organization, the U.S. Civil
Service Commission.

Applications and selections that are delegated to

agencies and local areas are added to the total to make the series
consistent over time.

2.

Model
A simple model of workers' decisions to apply for federal jobs is

presented below.

The basic framework is that optimizing agents compare

their expected lifetime utility from applying for a job in the federal
sector (including the cost of applying) to their expected lifetime
utility of not applying in deciding whether to apply for a federal job.5
An employee will apply for a government job if his expected utility is
higher if he applies for the job than if he does not apply.
Assume that each individual has a utility function of the form:

U

(1)

=

U(Wi,Bi)

BU/BW

>

0,

BU/BB > 0

;

i =

(g,p)

where W' represents the employee's discounted value of earnings in sector
i, and B1 represents a vector of nonwage benefits (fringe benefits,

working conditions, etc.) attached to sector i.

The superscript i refers

to either government jobs, g, or private sector jobs, p.

I initially

simplify the problem by assuming that all workers are identical in terms
of their abilities and preferences, and have probability q of being
selected by the government should they apply for a job.

It is further

assumed that individuals' preferences satisfy the von Neumann-Morgenstern
axioms.

If an individual applies for a government job he is hired with
probability q and has lifetime utility

U;

with probability (l-q) the

This model is formally similar to John Abowd and Henry Farber's (1982)
model of implicit queues for union jobs and Rebecca Blank's (1985) model
of sectoral choice. The present approach differs from these previous
studies in that I explicitly model actual applications instead of
implicit job queues, and in estimating the model I use direct
observations on the number of applications and selections.

Finally, I assume that the cost

(2) is that in expected value there

are no rents to be made on the margin by applying for a government job.

As setup, the model assumes that the prospective applicant will take a
private sector job with certainty if he does not apply for, or is not
selected for, a government job. This will follow if the worker currently
has a private sector job. If the worker does not have a certain private
sector alternative, he or she will weigh the utility of the private
sector job by the probability of getting a job there. As a result, the
empirical analysis controls for aspects of the labor market which
influence the probability of getting a private sector job, such as the
unemployment rate.
Note that this equation does not imply that the utility function is
risk neutral; instead, it implies that the uncertain outcome of applying
for a government or private sector job may be analyzed in terms of
expected utility.

—7-.

The number of individuals applying for job openings adjusts to eliminate
ex ante rents associated with government jobs.

As wage and nonwage

compensation offered by the federal government rise relative to the
private sector, individuals will Continue to apply for a given number of
federal job openings until the marginal worker is indifferent between
applying to either sector. And as the cost of applying for a federal job
increases or the cost of applying for a private sector job
decreases,
fewer individuals will apply for a given number of federal
job openings
so that equation (2) will again hold.
Heterogeneous Labor with Nonrandom Selection
If individuals differ in their productive capacities, and if the
government is able to make job offers to applicants on the basis of
workers' perceived abilities, the analysis becomes more
complicated. The
purpose here is only to present a heuristic discussion of these effects.
It is probably reasonable to assume that individuals have a
noisy
estimate of their ability relative to the population, and that the
government has an imperfect but positively correlated measure of each
applicant's ability.

A final assumption is that there is a positive

correlation between an individual's alternative wage in the private
sector and his or her ability.
An increase in the relative attractiveness of
government employment
(i.e.

an increase in

and 5g holding

W

and

B constant) in this

situation has two opposing effects on the application rate.

First, a job

candidate's expectation of being rated the most highly qualified
applicant and therefore of being selected for the job is diminished.
This occurs because individuals with higher alternative wages and
therefore greater expected ability will apply for the job
(Weiss, 1980;

-8-

Nalebuff and Stiglitz, 1982).

The average quality of the job queue

increases. In the extreme case, if employees know with certainty who the
most qualified applicant for the job will be, only that individual will
apply for the job.
The second effect occurs because the government job has become
relatively more attractive and is therefore worth applying for even
though the chance of ultimately being selected for the job is reduced.
This is the result that is developed formally in the model above in the
case of homogeneous labor.
If, as seems likely,

there is considerable uncertainty as to the

quality of competing job applicants and the validity of the government's
selection criteria, and little cost of applying for a government job, the
second effect will dominate.

However, the direction and magnitude of the

effect of a change in the relative attractiveness of government
employment on the application rate are empirical issues.

The Determinants of Job Applicants
Figure 1 depicts the relationship between the application rate for

all federal jobs (measured by the ratio of outside applications to new
hires) and the ratio of federal to private sector earnings. The relative
and
earnings variable in this instance is drawn from the National Income
Product Accounts because this is the only available source of annual
earnings data that covers the entire period over which application rate
data are available.8

The figure shows that applications per new hire and

relative earnings fluctuate substantially over time.

A fairly close

relationship between the two variables is apparent, especially between
1960 and 1980.

In years when the federal wage increases relative to the

private sector wage applications per new hire generally increase, and in
years when the federal wage decreases relative to the private sector wage
applications per new hire tend to decrease.
The tightness or looseness of the labor market also has an important
effect on the value and availability of individuals' private sector
alternatives. And in this connection it should be noted that employment
in the federal government displays relatively little cyclical variation
(Freeman, 1987).

Figure 2 illustrates the relationship between the

application rate and the unemployment rate.

The unemployment rate is an

indicator of the availability of private sector alternatives as well as a
measure of job search intensity. The application rate closely tracks the
unemployment rate.

The pattern strongly suggests that when the labor

market becomes loose from an employee's perspective, the number of
applicants for federal job openings increases.
Table 1 reports results from estimating multiple regressions to
predict the log of the annual application rate for federal jobs.

Since

the application rate displays serial correlation, I correct for first
order autocorrelation.9 Appendix Table Al reports results of regressions
on first-differences. Several factors are held constant in the
regressions to isolate the effect of the federal wage differential on the
application rate.

General labor market conditions are measured by the

The coefficient estimates are qualitatively similar when a second
order autoregression is estimated and when an OLS regression is
estimated.

Two dummy variables are included to control for

differences in federal recruitment practices over time: specifically, in
years after 1974 Post Offices were no longer used for recruiting, and in
years after 1965 OPM consolidated several of its regional offices.
Finally, a time trend is included to control for secular trends in
applications. The variables and data sources used in the regressions are
described in greater detail in the Data Appendix.11
The regression results reinforce the conclusions drawn from Figures
1 and 2.

The economic variables account for a large share of annual

variations in the application rate.

Furthermore, the log of the

government wage relative to the private sector wage denoted by in(W/Wl)
has an economically sizable and statistically significant effect on the
number of applications per worker hired.12

A

one percent increase in the

wage of federal workers over the wage of private sector workers is
associated with about a two percent increase in the number of job
applications per federal worker hired.

Moreover, this relationship

becomes stronger when additional variables are held constant.

In results not reported here I also control for the size and growth
rate of the labor force, the size of the federal government (measured by
the log of employment), one period lagged relative wages, and years in
which the Carter-Reagan hiring freeze was in effect. Controlling for
these variables does not qualitatively change the regression estimates.
12
Following Ehrenberg (1973) and Ashenfelter and Ehrenberg's (1975)
work on public sector labor demand, the government wage differential is
taken as exogenous of the length of the job queue. This assumption seems
reasonable because of the political factors that influence determination
of wages in the federal government, and because the federal wage is
unlikely to have an important effect on the aggregate private sector wage
(see Borjas, 1980 and 1984; Reder, 1975).

The specification of the relative earnings variable in Table

1

constrains the federal salary and private sector salary to have equal but
opposite signed effects on the application rate.

To check the

appropriateness of this specification, the regressions are re-estimated
allowing 1n(W) and 1n(W) to enter as separate regressors.

The results

of this exercise provide support for the specification in Table 1.

For

example, the results of re-estimating column (1) which are reported below
show that the government wage and private sector wage have virtually
equal but opposite effects on the application rate

Although the estimates reported above and in Table 1 rely on wage
data from the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA), the effect of
relative wages on applications is positive and statistically significant
when other sources of wage data are used.

For instance, when the average

wage of federal employees directly estimated from OPH's Central Personnel
Data File is used to re—estimate column (3) of Table 1, the coefficient
(standard error) on the relative earnings variable is 1.66

(35)13

Tabulations from OPHs Central Personnel Data File are reported
annually in Pay Structure of the Federal Civil Service (Washington, D.C.

earnings of federal workers is the numerator of the relative wage
variable; the denominator is the average private sector wage from the

differential derived from the PATC comparability survey, which is
available only in the years between 1968 and 1985, the coefficient
(standard error) on relative earnings is 1.44 (.46).14
Turning next to measures of the general condition of the labor
market, the unemployment rate and help wanted index have their expected
signs and usually border on statistical significance. A one percentage
point increase in the unemployment rate, for instance,

is associated with

a 6.49 percent increase in the application rate according to the estimate

in column (3).

However, the size and significance of the effect of the

unemployment rate diminishes when the dummy variables for recruitment
policies and the time trend are added to the regression.15
An increase in the index of help wanted ads is associated with a
decline in the number of applicants per federal job opening.

In

comparison to the wage ratio and the unemployment rate, however, the
regressions imply that a one standard deviation change in the help wanted
index has a relatively small effect on the application rate.

Finally, I

note that after controlling for the government wage differential, labor
market conditions, and changes in recruitment practices, the application
rate displays a slight upward trend over time.

14

Since Freeman finds that the various estimates of the federal-private
sector wage differential from the PATC survey, OPN's Personnel Data File,
and NIPA tend to move together over time although at a point in time they
often seem inconsistent, it is not very surprising that all three
variables yield relatively similar results here.
15

Results are qualitatively unchanged when the unemployment rate and
help wanted index are entered in log form.

—13-

Fringe Benefits
There is a widespread perception that fringe benefits in the federal
government exceed those in the private sector (e.g. Hartman 1983).

To

examine the impact of the relative level of fringe benefits on the
federal job application rate, the regression reported below controls for
the log of the ratio of average federal nonwage compensation to average
private sector nonwage compensation for full-time equivalent employees

(B8/B), using NIPA wage and nonwage

(S.E.'s in parentheses)

Surprisingly, the regression indicates that an increase in the level
of fringe benefits in the federal government relative to the private
sector has

a small,

statistically insignificant,

effect on the

application rate.'6 Moreover, the small standard error of this estimate
implies that the economically negligible effect of relative fringe
benefits on applications is precisely estimated. The relative earnings
variable, however, continues to have a sizeable,

positive impact on

federal job applicants after controlling for nonwage compensation.
Why might fringe benefits be unrelated to job applicants?

One

possible explanation is that prospective job applicants are not

16

It should be noted that this result does not appear to be entirely
driven by multicollinearity between relative earnings and relative fringe
benefits because the relative fringe benefits variable has a small,
statistically insignificant (though positive) effect on the application
rate when the relative earnings variable is dropped from the regression.

immediately cognizant of the availability or generosity of fringe
benefits.

Nonwage compensation, such as pension benefits and health

insurance, might not be a very salient or relevant feature of work for
job applicants, while in contrast, earnings are easily measured and
immediately relevant. On the other hand, another possible explanation is
that nonwage labor costs are a very noisy measure of the value of fringe
benefits to workers.

Random measurement error would have the effect of

biasing the relative fringe benefit coefficient toward zero.
Sex Differences
The federal government's equal employment opportunity policy and
affirmative action program give preferential treatment in hiring to
women.'7

This might be expected to lead to a different relationship

between applications and wages for men and women.

In addition,

differences in geographic mobility between men and women might also
affect application rates.

Unfortunately, diaggregated application data

are not available to perform a separate analysis by sex.

However, it is

possible to estimate the effect of sex differences in the relative
federal-private sector earnings differential on the overall application
rate.

Table 2 presents log application regressions controlling for the log
of the ratio of federal to private sector earnings for the median,

17

The same argument can be applied to the hiring of minorities and
verterans, but these issues are not examined empirically because
sufficient time-series data on relative earnings by sector are not
available for these groups.

Changes in the

federal-private earnings differential for the median male and median
female worker have about an equal, positive impact on the overall job
application rate.

The elasticity of the overall application rate with

respect to relative earnings is slightly greater for male workers than
female workers, but the difference is not statistically significant at
conventional levels.

Furthermore, these conclusions are unchanged when

the sample period is restricted to years after the Civil Rights Act took
effect.
Quality of Applicants
The results presented so far do not control for the quality of job
applicants. Unfortunately, only scant evidence is available on the
quality of applicants for federal jobs.

One admittedly crude measure of

the quality of applicants for federal jobs is the number of applicants
who were judged minimally qualified to perform their prospective job.19
OPM collected such data nationally in 22 of the last 36 years.

On

for their
average, 59% of applicants were judged minimally qualified

prospective jobs during these years.

data are available. To aave degreea of freedom, only the relative wage
rate and labor market factors are held constant.

For comparison, the

second column of the table reports regression estimates of the log of the
overall application rate on the same set of controls and sample.

The

third column examines the effect of the independent variables on the log
of the ratio of minimally qualified applicants to all
applicants.
The table shows that a one percent change in the federal wage
differential haa a greater positive impact on the number of qualified
applicants per new hire than on the total application rate during this
time period.

As a result, the fraction of job applicants who are at

least minimally qualified to perform the job they applied for increases
as the average federal-private wage differential increases.
Finally, it appears that the application rate of qualified workers
is less responsive than the total application rate to
changes in the
unemployment rate and help wanted index.

The effect of these two

variables on the fraction of the applicant pool that is considered
qualified, however, is statistically insignificant.
Within-Occupation Analysis
The aggregate time-series analysis above reflects the entire
spectrum of federal and private sector jobs.

This approach ia

appropriate if the mix of federal and private sector jobs remained
relatively constant over the time period studied.
To examine the effect of relative wages on the number of
applicants
for federal jobs within the aame occupation, the following
equation is
estimated with panel data:

A one percent increase in the government wage

differential is associated with a 2.37 percent increase in the

This

The white collar unemployment rate appears to have a very large

aggregate time—series analysis. The index of help wanted ads, however,
has an insignificant effect in the occupational analysis.
Lastly, I note that there is considerable variation in the
application rate across occupational lines even after controlling for
occupation specific relative wage differentials. Engineers appear to
have the lowest application rate while accountants and auditors
appear to
have the greatest application rate among the five occupational
groups.
Thia pattern might reflect the relative supply of workers with these
types of skills or unmeasured aspects of the relative attractiveness of
government employment that varies across these occupations.
Inter-City Analysis
With relatively few exceptions, the government pays the same wage to
workers who are in the same grade of an occupation nationwide.20 Private
sector wages, on the other hand, vary considerably across regions and
cities of the U.S.

The rigid government nominal wage schedule therefore

leads to differences in the ratio of government wages to
private sector
wages across cities, and if workers are mobile, should influence the
number of applicants for federal jobs across cities.

To what extent can

inter-city variability in the federal to private sector wage ratio
explain the inter-city pattern of application rates?
City—wide application rates for federal nursing jobs are examined
here because the qualifications for these jobs are well defined, and
because requisite data are available for eleven cities.

in the federal government.

It it noteworthy that more than

three-quarters of federal nurses work in Veterans Administration

hospitals, and that 91% of federal nursing jobs were filled by
1985.

The proper alternative wage for federal nurses is probably the

wage of nurses employed by non-federal hospitals in the nearby geographic
area.

Table 5 presents the application rate for federal nursing jobs and
the ratio of average earnings of nurses employed by federal VA hospitals
to average earnings of nurses employed by non-federal hospitals in each
city.

Looking across cities, there appears to be a weak positive

relationship between the application rate and relative earnings (r.22).
In Washington, D.C. and St. Louis, for instance, the federal wage is
relatively high compared to non-federal sector wages for nurses, and the
government receives relatively many applicants per new hire.

Nonetheless, some significant anomalies are

For example, the number of applications per nurse hired in New

York is the highest among the eleven cities, while the ratio of federal
to non-federal earnings is relatively low in New York.

Conclusion
This paper has examined the determinants of queues for federal

government jobs as measured by the job application rate.

The principal

findings are: 1) the number of job applications filed per worker hired
increases sharply as the average wage of government workers increases
relative to the average wage of private sector workers; 2) the number of
qualified applicants per worker hired, as well as the fraction of job
applicants who are qualified to perform their prospective job, increases
as the relative average wage of government workers increases; 3) the
number of applications per new hire does not appear to be related to the
relative level of fringe benefits; and 4) the number of applications per
new hire increases as the unemployment rate increases, and decreases as
the help wanted index increases. Noreover, these conclusions seem to
hold in both aggregate time-series data and in longitudinal data on
occupational groups over time.
These findings have several implications for federal wage setting
and recruitment policy.

The analysis shows that an increase in the wage

of federal workers will lead to an increase in the number and average
quality of applicants for federal jobs.

Since job application rates

appear to reflect economic incentives, the case for using application
data as a mechanism for adjusting wages is strengthened.

If the number

of job applications for a given job opening falls below or rises above a
certain level, wages can be adjusted accordingly to minimize costs.

In

addition, the results suggest that increasing fringe benefits is not an
effective way to recruit workers.
An important unresolved issue is the determination of the proper
standard for judging the optimal number of applicants for job openings

ir

—21-

the federal government.

A backlog of applicanta allowa vacanciea to be

filled rapidly and facilitates efficient job matchea, but reaourcea are
uaed inefficiently if wages are set above the optimal level.

A natucal

standard of comparison for the government's application rate is the
application rate for jobs in the private sector.

A first attempt to

compare job queues in the government and private sector is presented in
Krueger (1987).

However, a comparison between the application rate in

the private and public sectors

is hindered by the salience of the

government and by differences in recruitment practices used by public and
private sector employers. It is noteworthy that Bishop, Barron and
Hollenbeck (1984) and others find that employer size and search
activities have an important effect on the number of applications
received by private sector establishments. The application rate for
federal sector jobs and private sector jobs may not be directly
comparable.

An alternative approach would be to study the effect of differencea
in application rates on the productivity and efficiency of government
agencies.

The optimal application rate can be based on organizational

performance and actual experience rather than on a rigid comparison with
private sector employers. Finally, a valuable complement to the analyaia
here would be an examination of the determinants of the rate at which
workers turn down job offers.

Like the application rate, the turn down

rate reflects workers' alternative opportunities in the labor market.
The job turn down rate can serve as a additional indicator of the
relative generosity of compensation.
