The Unexpected Long-Run Impact of the Minimum Wage: An Educational Cascade

NBER Working Paper No. 16355
September 2010
JEL No. I28,J24,J3,J31,J48,J8,N32,N42
ABSTRACT
Neglected, but significant, the long-run consequence of the minimum wage – which was made national
policy in the United States in 1938 – is its stimulation of capital deepening. This took two forms.
First, the engineered shortage of low-skill, low-paying jobs induced teenagers to invest in additional
human capital – primarily by extending their schooling – in an attempt to raise their productivity to
the level required to gain employment. Second, employers faced with an inability to legally hire low-wage
workers, rearranged their production processes to substitute capital for low-skill labor and to innovate
new technologies. This paper explores the impact of the minimum wage on enrollments between 1950
and 2003. I describe an upward ratcheting mechanism which triggers an “educational cascade.” My
estimate is that the average number of years of high school enrollment would have risen to only 3.5
years, rather than 3.7 years, for men born in 1951. Thereafter, enrollment rates would have trended
down to about 3.2 years for the cohort born in 1986, rather than slowly rising to around 3.9 years.
The cumulative effect of the minimum wage increases beginning in 1950 was to add 0.7 years to the
average high school experience of men born in 1986.

Except perhaps for the Social Security Act, [the Fair Labor Standards Act] is the
most far-reaching, the most far-sighted program for the benefit of workers ever
adopted here or in any other country.
Franklin D. Roosevelt, “Fireside Chat,” June 24, 1938.1

The minimum wage is a contentious and emotional issue in the United States and it has
been for almost a century.2 A short-hand version of the issue at stake was famously
stated by Milton Friedman in Playboy magazine: “A minimum-wage law is, in reality, a
law that makes it illegal for an employer to hire a person with limited skills” [1973].3
Proponents, of course, argue that the purpose of a minimum wage is to ensure that every
(covered) worker earns an income that can purchase at least the bare necessities of good
health and a “living decent according to the standard of the time,” a living, in the words
of Franklin Roosevelt, “which gives man not only enough to live by, but something to
live for.”4 Framed in this way, the minimum wage has been a cause for political battle
between Democrats (pro) and Republicans (con) whenever it has been raised at the
federal, state, or local level.5 That means it has been almost continuously the object of
heated debate. This political passion is a bit curious since most experts for many years

Massachusetts was the first state to adopt a minimum wage law in 1912. It was a “recommendatory” law
that applied only to women and minors [Kelley 1912]. In 1935 this was replaced with a mandatory law and
in 1946 the law was amended to apply to men [US Department of Labor 1967: 93-95]. The minimum wage
became federal law with the passage of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. The federal minimum wage
applied uniformly to all covered employees (male and female) in all regions of the country.

Wright and Joshua Rosenbloom and William Sundstrom place the origin of the minimum wage in the
context of the “high-wage national regime” that lasted for fifty years following World War I and that
induced the coinciding period of rapid productivity growth and rising educational attainment [Wright 2006:

have regarded the minimum wage as a largely irrelevant institutional hangover from the
New Deal.6

The legislated minimum has frequently been so low relative to prevailing wages
that few workers or occupations are affected. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics
estimated the fraction of employed wage and salary workers with earnings at or below the
Federal minimum wage in 2005 at only 2.5 percent [U.S. BLS 2006: Table 1, also see
Haugen and Mellor 1990].7 In 1938 the national minimum wage was set at 25 cents per
hour which was raised to 30 cents the following year and, according to Gavin Wright,
had a major impact in the South particularly for blacks working in textiles and tobacco
[1986: 219-220], but soon thereafter the minimum wage was “repealed by inflation,” as
George Stigler remarked in 1946 [p. 358]. From time to time, Congress has increased the
nominal minimum wage and expanded the coverage of the law. In 1950 it was increased
from 40 to 75 cents per hour. In July of 2008 it became $6.55 with a further increase in
July 2009 to $7.25. See Table 1 for a tabulation of all of the changes. These periodic
decisions by Congress succeeded in increasing the real value of the wage floor until
1968, but thereafter the legislated increases have failed to catch up or keep up with

Charles Brown, a University of Michigan labor economist and a veteran of the minimum wage debates in
the academy, stated the case for relative unimportance twenty years ago in his paper “Minimum Wage
Laws: Are they Overrated?” [1988]. David Card and Alan Krueger forcefully and persuasively argued that
increases in the minimum wage did not lead to a corresponding loss of jobs nor an increase in
unemployment [1995]. David Neumark and William Wascher are associated with the argument that
minimum wages reduce job opportunities for teenagers, yet they report that their 1992 article did “not
reveal disemployment effects of minimum wages for teenagers” [1995a: 199]. For a sampling of
journalistic reports see the following, all from the New York Times and all suggesting that the minimum
wage has or would have minimal economic consequences: Peter Passell [1989]; Susan Raskey, “The
Minimum-Wage Fight Isn't Really About Pay” [1989]; Louis Uchitelle [1990 and 1995]; Robyn Meredith,
“Politics Aside, Economy Is Shrugging Off Rise to $4.75” [1996]; and Peter Kilborn, “A Minimal-Impact
Minimum Wage” [1997]. Passell, an economic historian before he became a journalist, cites the research
of Alison Wellington, who found little or no impact of the minimum wage on employment [Wellington
1991]. Raskey attributed to Isabel Sawhill, a labor economist at the Urban Institute, the opinion that the
minimum wage “isn't going to make a big difference one way or the other.'' Uchitelle [1995] quotes Nobel
laureate Robert Solow: "The main thing about this research is that the evidence of job loss is weak, and the
fact that the evidence is weak suggests that the impact on jobs is small." Meredith quotes Barry Bosworth,
an economist at the Brookings Institution: ''The whole issue is overblown.''

The incidence is much higher for teenagers, the focus of this report. The 2005 estimate for teenagers is
8.8 percent.

inflation. See Figure 1 which plots the federal minimum wage measured in terms of the
prices of 2007.

In early studies econometricans who attempted to measure the impact of the
minimum wage on employment generally reported only a small effect and that only for
teenagers. A careful review by Charles Brown, Curtis Gilroy, and Andrew Kohen
considered 18 pre-1982 studies each of which employed a time-series analysis of
published data derived from the Current Population Surveys (CPS). All 18 reported a
negative impact on teenage employment. The point estimates suggested that a 10-percent
minimum wage increase would reduce teenage employment by between 0.5 and 3.0
percent [Brown, Gilroy, and Kohen 1982: 505; also see the update in Brown 1999].
However, Brown and his coauthors regard the lower part of the range as most plausible
because they regard the tests that produced the lower numbers to be the better specified.
Studies conducted in the 1980s and early 1990s reduced the estimate of the negative
impact on teenage employment induced by a 10-percent increase in the minimum wage to
less than 1 percent [Solon 1985, Adams 1989, Wellington 1991; Card and Kruger 1995:
180-182, 194-204]. Because the teenage employment rate averages about 45 percent, a
reduction of 1 percent corresponds to a reduction of 0.45 percentage points in the
employment rate, a small effect. Taken together these studies do not allow us to reject
the proposition that the true effect is zero. There seems to be no discernable evidence of
an impact on employment overall.8

Quite apart from the issue of whether the minimum wage leads to job loss, I
suggest that a neglected, but significant, consequence of the minimum wage requirement
is its stimulation of capital deepening. This took two forms. First, the engineered
shortage of low-skill, low-paying jobs induced teenagers to invest in additional human
8

David Card and Alan Kruger launched a devastating critique of the empirical literature I have just
summarized [1995: Chapters 6 and 7]. They conclude that the previous estimates are not robust and that
“the conventional view that increases in the minimum wage necessarily have an adverse effect on
employment has very weak empirical foundations” [pp. 236-237].

capital – primarily by extending their schooling – in an attempt to raise their productivity
to the level required for employment. Second, employers faced with an inability to
legally hire low-wage workers, rearranged their production processes to innovate new
technology and substitute capital for low-skill labor. This essay will focus on the first
phenomenon, the impact on educational attainment.

I begin from the premise that the debate over the employment effects of the
minimum wage has been misfocused. A labor market with a binding minimum wage is
out of equilibrium. In that situation, the alternative to employment for many teenagers is
to stay in school. Thus the long-run impact of the minimum wage might well be to
increase the stock of human capital: a clearly beneficial, if unexpected, consequence of
the minimum wage policy. Yet the impact of the minimum wage on employment is in
any case agreed to be rather slight, so one might suggest that any supposed impact on
increasing the level of educational attainment is likely to be slight as well. I suggest,
however, that there are two reasons to believe that the effect might be strong. First, the
minimum wage does have a significant bite for teenagers. I also propose an additional
point. There is a ratchet mechanism through which the initial response to a change in the
minimum wage can trigger an “educational cascade” producing a sustained increase in
educational attainment.

To visualize how a cascade might operate, consider a cohort of 15-year old highschool students most of whom would be enrolled in the tenth grade. Each must make a
decision about whether to continue to the eleventh grade. The alternative to school is to
join the labor force or to voluntarily join the non-employed.9 One economic factor that
would influence this decision would be the local unemployment rate of teenagers. Since
15-year olds are not likely to look these statistics up at the library or even read about
them in the newspaper, we suppose they form an impression of employment possibilities
9

For the student who decides to stay enrolled, part-time (after-school) employment is also a possibility. As
a possible motive to drop out, an alternative to a legitimate job is to join the underground economy and to
engage in criminal activities with a pecuniary reward (drug dealing, prostitution, theft) [Freeman 1996].
My focus is on the enrollment decision, not the labor-force status or occupation of the teenager.

by observation of the experiences of those like themselves in the local job market. Thus
the relevant unemployed rates would be those for individuals of the same race, gender,
and locality – those of the individual’s likely “role-model” group. Thus a black 15-year
old male would be likely to consider the job-market experiences of the 16- to 19-year old
black men who were not in school in his locality.

There would be another peer-effect on the school-versus-labor-force decision
coming directly from the student’s classmates. Dropping out would be a significant and
probably difficult decision. For most it will be irreversible [Card and Lemieux 2000: 8-9
and Table 1]. In such a situation it is natural that the student would consult and often
mimic his peers. If more of the high school students our 15-year-old knows stay in
school and go on to the next grade, he will be encouraged to continue as well.

Role-model and peer effects are not the only influences on the school attendance
decision. I presume that the opportunity cost of going to school will influence the
decision. The opportunity cost will be largely driven by the wage the student can expect
if he takes a job. What a binding minimum wage will do is to dramatically lower the
opportunity cost of schooling for those whose skills do not yet warrant receiving the
minimum wage. In a job market with a high minimum wage, the earning prospects of a
student with sub-minimum skills are nil.10 Thus an increase in the minimum wage should
reduce the dropout rate for this cohort by lowering the opportunity cost of staying in
school.

10

I am skirting the issue that not all jobs are covered by the federal minimum wage law. The original law
covered workers in private industries engaged in interstate commerce or the production of goods for
commerce. It excluded such major sectors as agriculture, retail trade, and service [Douglas and Hackman
1939: 29-33]. Effective in 1950 coverage was reduced by narrowing the meaning of production for
interstate commerce. In 1961 employees of retail establishments with sales over $1 million were added. In
1967 employees of schools, colleges, hospitals, hotels, restaurants, and laundries and employees of large
farms were added. In addition the retail sales volume test was reduced to $250,000 [Frankel 1966,
Waltman 2000: 46]. By 1968 coverage of wage workers by the federal law was reasonably complete and
many states had their own minimum wage laws that extended protection to those not covered by the federal
law. Moreover, there is some evidence that many (most?) employers who are not required to pay the
minimum wage do so nonetheless [Card and Krueger 1995: 158, Fritsch 1981, Uchitelle 1990, Katz and
Krueger 1991, 1992].

As I envision this mechanism moving forward in time, a feedback would then
produce a ratchet effect operating on the next cohort. If the minimum wage increase
causes a greater fraction of the tenth-grade class to stay in school, then the next year’s
tenth graders will see a greater number of their peers staying in school than would have
been the case without the minimum wage increase. Thus even without further minimum
wage increases the dropout rate will remain lower than it would have been otherwise. In
principle this ratchet effect can influence educational trends for several, perhaps many,
years. However, if inflation and productivity increases begin to erode the bite the
minimum wage takes out of the lower tail of the wage distribution, the forces supporting
the reduction in dropout rates would become attenuated. Another increase in the
minimum wage would be necessary to revive the effect.

As educational attainment rises over time, it will generate a scarcity of low-skilled
laborers whose employment would be warranted at the minimum wage relative to the
skill distributions that characterized the past. One consequence is that this relative
shortage would induce employers to substitute capital for low-skilled workers. Think
about the computer-assisted order kiosk in a fast-food restaurant. The take-out clerk can
punch in the customer’s order which immediately flashes on a computer screen in the
kitchen and automatically computes the bill and the amount of change to return and even
prompts the clerk to ask if the customer would like the order “super-sized” or to suggest a
side of fries. A consequence of the capital-labor substitution is to raise the productivity
of workers with limited skills. Thus, increasing the minimum wage should work to
increase the productivity of those at the bottom of the skill distribution.11

If not counteracted, a shortage of low-skilled workers combined with a rising
productivity of low-skilled workers operating with more sophisticated capital might drive
up the market-clearing wage for low-skilled workers and thus erode the bite of the
11

The argument that a minimum wage would stimulate technological innovation was made by Sydney
Webb [1912: 981-983]. The mechanism might also work in reverse. Gavin Wright has suggested that the
decline in the real minimum wage evident in Figure 1 after the 1960s was one element contributing to the
productivity slowdown in the 1970s [Wright 2006: 152-153].

minimum wage and slow down or even halt the educational cascade. However, in a
global economy with open boarders the shortage of low-skilled domestically-educated
workers would stimulate the immigration of such workers from abroad, thus widening the
wage distribution and increasing the returns to additional education of the native born.
Immigration (documented or not) then will serve to prevent a stifling of the long-run
educational impact of a minimum wage increase. Another possibility is that the shortage
of low-skilled workers will induce producers to import goods and services with low skill
content from suppliers abroad, thus producing much the same beneficial impact on school
attendance as immigration.

Too much of the theoretical literature on the minimum wage has assumed that
low-skilled workers are homogeneous. In the scenario I have just sketched, I assume – as
seems realistic – that high school students are heterogeneous in the distribution of their
job-relevant skills. I illustrate the point in Figure 2. The bell curve represents the
hypothesized distribution of skills (in real terms) of students still enrolled in high school
in period t facing an increase in the minimum wage from MWt to MWt+1. For ease of
reference, I will place high school students into three groups. Some, who I will call “the
relative skillful,” have skills such that – in a suitable job – would contribute sufficient
product at the margin to warrant more than the proposed minimum wage. At the other
extreme are the “sub-minimal” students who have skills (or a maturity) so low that they
could not be productively employed at any job paying the current minimum wage. At an
intermediate position, the “marginal group” would be able to secure productive
employment at the current minimum but unable to do so at the higher minimum.

The enrollment decision of the skillful and sub-minimal students would be
unaffected by the proposed change in the minimum wage. It would be marginal students
who would be shut out of the labor market by an increase in the minimum wage and thus
see the opportunity cost of their schooling fall. Note that in periods where the nominal
minimum wage is constant, the marginal group collapses to a razor thin slice.

Richard Sutch

This distribution of job-relevant skills is not the same as the distribution of
academically-relevant abilities. An individual student’s position in the distribution
depicted in Figure 2 would not be static. It will shift rightward as time goes on.
Additional schooling will enhance job-related skills and move the individual to the right.
How effective additional schooling will be in moving the student to higher skill levels
will depend – presumably – upon the student’s academic abilities. The higher those
attributes, the higher the perceived return to continued enrollment. That is why not every
relatively-skillful student will take a job. Some will, of course, but their lower academic
promise may be the cause.12

I can also illustrate the influence of the introduction of new technologies and
higher capital-labor ratios on the three groups. Labor productivity would be raised by
those phenomena, shifting the entire distribution to the right (relative to the MWt and
MWt+1 lines) and carrying every student with it. That would sweep some marginal
students into the relatively-skillful group where those with low academic potential will be
tempted to drop out. To prevent the consequent decline in enrollments, the minimum
wage would have to be adjusted upward to at least keep up with productivity advances.

The educational cascade I am describing is not incompatible with the proposition
that a minimum wage increase would have no negative employment consequences. If
everyone employed before the increase retained his or her job and if every vacancy
created by voluntary attrition were filled, it would still remain the case that a law that
makes it illegal for an employer to hire a person with sub-minimal skills would shut the
student in the marginal group just described out of the market and thus lower the
opportunity cost of remaining in school.

12

Poverty or a temporary setback might force some academically promising students in the skillful group to
drop out. If so, the fault would be imperfect capital markets that make it impossible or prohibitively
expensive to borrow with only academic promise as collateral.

This report will explore the connections linking the minimum wage and
educational attainment using a variety of data sources. It will set aside for another project
the impact of the minimum wage on inducing investments in physical capital, spurring
technological innovation, or stimulating an increase in low-skilled immigration.
Compared to the quite extensive literature on the employment effects of the minimum
wage, there has been very little empirical work on the impact of the minimum wage on
schooling.13

To explore the enrollment consequences of an increase in the minimum wage I
turn to two different sources of data. For the period 1968 to the present I use the microlevel data drawn from the public-use files of the October Survey of Current Population
[Unicon Research 2007]. Although the school enrollment questions associated with the
October surveys date back to 1947, only the published summaries are available for the
years before 1968. For the period before 1972, I use the micro-level data in the
Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS) drawn from the enumerators’
manuscripts of 1980, 1970, and 1960 censuses of the U.S. population [Ruggles et al
2008]. The two data sources are quite different. They pose unique complications and
offer unique opportunities. I will treat them separately, beginning with the more recent.
This partition by data source is unfortunate because coincidentally the general trend of
the national real minimum wage has been downward since 1968, while it was generally
rising between 1950 and 1968 [see Figure 1]. In what follows I make my best effort to
adjust for the changes in my evidentiary bases.

13

I know of only a few prior studies. James Ragan in a passing footnote reported a time-series regression in
which the unemployment rate and the minimum wage rate had no impact on school enrollment to justify an
assumption to that end [1977: fn 17]. Peter Mattila has made an argument that is in part similar to mine
[1981]. “There is good reason to believe that school enrollment may be affected. If minimum wages create
barriers to employment, then additional schooling may be one strategy for over-coming that barrier …”
[1981: 61]. David Neumark and William Wascher [1995a, 1995b, and 2003] reach an opposite
conclusion. They report that “the minimum wage reduces the proportion of teenagers in school.” However,
they emphasize the preliminary nature of their results and suggest that the topic “merits further scrutiny”
[Neumark and Wascher 2003: 9].

It should also be noted that throughout the entire period some states enacted
minimum wage laws that exceeded the federal minimum established by the Fair Labor
Standards Act and its amendments. See Figure 3. When the state law established a
minimum wage that exceeded the federal minimum, the state law takes precedence. We
will exploit the information inherent in the interstate variance in the legal minimum in
what follows.

Post-1971 Tests for Impact of Changes in the Federal and State Minimum Wage
Laws
For parsimony’s sake – I begin with a look at changes in the federal minimum wage rate
before turning to the variation in state laws. Before the latest (2007-2009) round of
minimum wage increases, there are four episodes that we can examine with the October
CPS data. For ease of identification, I label the rounds of increases with the name of the
President who signed the corresponding minimum wage bill:14
Nixon Round – 1974-1976
1 May 1974
1 January 1975
1 January 1976

from $1.60

Enacted: April 1974
to $2.00
to $2.10
to $2.30

Carter Four Step – 1978-1981
1 January 1978
from $2.30
1 January 1979
1 January 1980
1 January 1981

Enacted: November 1977
to $2.65
to $2.90
to $3.10
to $3.35

Bush I Round – 1990-1991
1 April 1990
1 October 1991

Enacted: November 1989
to $3.80
to $4.25

from $3.35

14

This nomenclature is a bit misleading because each of the five minimum wage bills emerged as a
compromise between the supporters of a raise (most Democratic congress members and Presidents Clinton
and Carter) and opponents (Republican legislators). The dates of enactment are reported in the New York
Times [Apple 1974, “Carter Signs” 1977, Rosenbaum 1989, Stevenson 1996, and Labaton 2007].

to $4.75

to $5.85

to $7.25

It is important to examine these federal changes by rounds since the second, third, and
fourth steps can be anticipated as of the date the first step is enacted. Thus forewarned,
the impact of the subsequent steps may influence student decisions before they actually
take effect.

I use the October surveys from the CPS because they contain detailed questions
about education; in particular there is the response recorded to a question about the
school grade currently attended.15 This information was recorded for everyone aged 3
and older. The CPS surveys recognized four grades of “high school” defined as 9th
through 12th grade. By merging the October results for all the available years (19682006) I can follow a birth cohort from year to year. A student who was 15-years old in
October 1968 would be 16 in 1969, 17 in 1970, and so on. A birth cohort series
assembled in this manner describes a “statistical” rather than a true cohort since we have
a sample of 15 year-olds in 1968 and a separate sample of 16 year olds in 1969 which
would include many individuals not surveyed in the previous year.16 But if the samples
15

This is reported in two variables. One is named grdatt and labeled “Grade attending” in the Unicon
version of the October data files. The other is named chgrd and labeled “Grade or year child is attending.”
For ages 15 and up the information is recorded in grdatt. For ages 13 and 14 the information is recorded in
grdatt for 1968-1983 and in chgrd for 1989-2006. For the period 1984-1988 the information for 13-year
olds is recorded in chgrd while that for 14-year olds is in grdatt. Producing a consistent time series is
complicated for 1968-1983 since children (age 3-13) recorded in grdatt are coded with a different set of
codes than used for adults (14 and up). The incarcerated population is excluded and beginning in 1994 the
universe excludes members of the military. No distinction is made in the CPS between enrollment and
attendance.
16

A statistical cohort is not quite the same as a “synthetic” cohort since the latter is derived from a crosssection. The statistical cohort follows an actual birth cohort but draws a different (random) sample from
that cohort each year.

represent the experience of those who were born between 15 October 1952 and 14
October 1953 (1953 + 15 = 1968) and who survived into the following year.
For each cohort I cumulate the average number of years of high school enrollment
experienced between ages 13 and 20. A time series of this statistic for males is displayed
as the top line in the top panel of Figure 4. The shaded bars indicate the cohorts that
experienced a change in the minimum wage while of high school age. In an appendix I
give an example based on the Nixon round of minimum wage increases to illustrate how
the affected cohorts were determined. In that episode the cohort born in 1959
experienced all three minimum wage increases of the Nixon round before they reached
17. That cohort was 17-years old in 1976 and is indicated that way in the Figure. That
cohort also reported more years of high school enrollment (3.78 years) than the 1957 and
1958 birth cohorts (3.68 and 3.69 years respectively).

The three other rounds of minimum wage increases appear to have produced a
similar ratcheting up in school attendance. All four episodes coincide with a noticeable
increase in the average amount of high school experienced.17 Moreover, much of the
gain from each episode persisted. According to my argument this effect can be attributed
to the educational cascade caused by peer emulation. Indeed, the entire upward trend in
male high school attainment during the period since 1972 can plausibly be attributed to
minimum wage increases.18 We can illustrate this by removing the gains observed for the
17

For the Carter four-step round the four cohorts born 1961-1964 were the most affected. The cohort of
1961 experienced two Carter steps between age 16 and 18. Those in the cohort of 1962 experienced three
steps between age 15 and 18. The cohort of 1963 experienced all four steps during their high school years.
Those from the cohort of 1964 experienced the last three Carter steps between age 14 and 17. The Bush I
round had two steps. The cohorts of 1973 and 1974 experienced both of those changes between ages 15
and 18. The Clinton round also had two steps, but the first step took place on 1 October 1996 only a few
days before the October CPS survey of that year. I take the cohorts of 1980 and 1981 as those that were
most affected. Considering the simultaneity of the first step and the October survey, the cohort of 1979
experienced only one upward tick and that was between age 17 and 18. The cohort of 1982 witnessed the
first step between age 13 and 14 and the second between 14 and 15.
18

Of course, there were several profound shifts in the labor market for those with less educational
attainment beginning in the mid-1970s. Of particular importance was the increasing wage gap between

treated cohorts and then splice together the changes that remain. This is illustrated
diagrammatically by constructing the lower time trend in the upper panel of the figure.
Remarkably, that line shows a downward trend.

As the lower panel of Figure 4 illustrates, the pattern for women is much the same
as that for men. Women also reported increases in attendance at all four rounds. The
magnitude of the increase for the Nixon round is less dramatic compared with that for
men, but the magnitudes are roughly the same for the following three rounds.19 An
exercise that deletes the periods of minimum wage exposure and splices the remaining
years together for women is also presented in the figure. This demonstrates that the
upward drift in high school exposure for women since the mid-1970s can be eliminated
by removing the ratcheting influence of the cohorts treated by the minimum wage.

Testing for the Impact of State Minimum Wage Increases, 1968-2003
One objection to the foregoing analysis is that a number of the states had set minimum
wages higher than the federal rate during this period. In those states the relevant rate is
the state minimum, not the federal. Moreover, the changes in these state minimums often
took place at different dates than the federal changes. I will deal with this concern in two
ways. First, I compute the time series on the number of years of high school experienced
by each cohort including only states in which the federal law dominated. I compare that
series with that for all states which I displayed in Figure 4. This exercise is performed
separately for each of the four post-1969 rounds since the states included in the first
series changes as both federal and state laws are revised. The second test examines the
schooling enrollments for a selection of states that set minimums at a higher level than
the federal government and which changed their minimums on dates that differed from
those with a high school diploma and those without. It has been suggested that this would explain the
upward drift in the average number of years of schooling in the period under study. What I am suggesting
is that whatever impact the changing returns to schooling had they were primarily manifested during the
rounds of minimum wage increases.
19

Interestingly, during the Nixon era the graduation rates for women and men measured at age 20 were
roughly equal, but following 1975 female graduation rates were consistently higher than that for men.

the federal changes. Among this set of state demonstrations it is possible to compare the
state change(s) under examination with the experience of states that had no changes in
either federal or state law.
The first approach calculates the number of years of high school enrollment
experienced by each cohort only for states that did not exceed the federal standard. An
unpublished Data Appendix available from the author indicates the states that were
included in each of the four tests.20

Figure 5 present the results for men. In two of the

cases examined, the Nixon round and the Bush I round, the results are clearly stronger
than in the original. In the Carter round the result is somewhat weaker than measured
without excluding any states, but is still quite substantial. During the Clinton round the
expansion of high school experience is measured at approximately the same magnitude.

As illustrated in Figure 3 there have been five episodes since 1950 when a
significant number of states raised the minimum wage above the federal level. These five
episodes preceded five rounds of increases legislated by Congress beginning with the
Nixon round of 1974-1976. It would seem at first that this implies that there should be
many cases that could be examined individually. However, due to limitations of the CPS
data a number of the potential cases cannot be examined. The last cohort we can observe
fully at the time writing was born in 1986 and was 20 in 2006, the last year for which the
CPS data is presently available. That cutoff date, a year before the Bush II round, makes
the examination of that episode premature. We are constrained when considering the first
episode of state increases as well. For the years 1968-1973, the variable indicating the
state of residence is aggregated in the public-use data source into regional groupings for
most states. Of the 12 states that raised their minimum above the federal level prior to
the Nixon round, only four, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, and Illinois, can be
individually examined. Only one additional state, California, is individually identified
during the years prior to the Carter Four Step round of increases.

20

For the Nixon Round test some states were excluded because of the aggregated geocoding in the CPS
files for 1968-1976.
Richard Sutch
Minimum Wage Draft September 1, 2010

An additional limitation is produced by the annual nature of the CPS surveys,
conducted in October of each year. Some states raised their rates less than a year before
the subsequent change in the federal minimum. Illinois, for example, raised its rate in
January 1974 only a few months before the federal increase in May of that year. Thus in
our annual data source, Illinois’ change would appear coincident with the federal change.
That leaves only three states for our pre-Nixon test: New York, which changed its law in
July 1970; Connecticut, October 1971;21 and New Jersey, October 1972.

The left-hand panel of Figure 6 graphically displays the minimum wage history of
these three states for the 1970’s. The lower line in each case is the federal minimum; the
upper line displays the state’s minimum wage when it exceeds the federal rate. The
shading indicates the periods when the state minimum exceeded the federal. Note that
the vertical scale is logarithmic and measures the wage rates in nominal dollars. The
right-hand panel of Figure 6 presents the results for these three states taken together and
compares them with the results for a selection of states where federal law dominates.22 As
anticipated, the three-state aggregate displays a prominent spike in high school
attendance before the Nixon round. And that spike was larger than the reaction to the
Nixon round in those states. This makes sense, of course, since the impact of the May
1974 federal increase was muted in those states.23

Four states raised their rates above the federal level prior to the Carter round
initiated in 1978. Two of those were New York and New Jersey. The other two were

21

Connecticut officially raised its minimum allowable rate above the federal level in May 1971 but it was
only by a symbolic one cent. In October the state raised its minimum to 25 cents above the federal level of
$1.60.
22

I have aggregated the three states because of the low number of observations in Connecticut and New
Jersey.
23

We might also note that these three states were all states that experienced high enrollment rates compared
with the rest of the county making proportional increases in the enrollment rate less likely.

California and Hawai’i. None of the four can be separately analyzed.24 The best episode
of the four for testing the impact of state increases is the period of the late 1980s. Eleven
states raised their rates above the federal level. However, the last of the 11, Iowa, timed
the effective date of its increase only four months before the federal change. Three
others, Wisconsin, North Dakota, and Oregon, raised rates less than a year before the first
increase of the Bush I round. The remaining seven can be divided into three distinct
groups, Maine, Vermont, and Rhode Island increased their standards between October
1984 and October 1986. Hawai’i and California moved between October 1987 and
October 1988. Those two were followed by Washington and Pennsylvania, both
increasing their minimum rates on January 1989. In each case an upward shift in
enrollment is recorded by the CPS and in each case it was substantially larger than the
movement shown for the states that did not raise their minimums above the federal level.

Pre-1972 Tests for Impact of Changes in the Federal Minimum Wage Law
The micro-level CPS data used for the post-1971 tests is unavailable before 1968. Thus I
need to switch data sets and adopt a different approach to study the impacts of changes in
the federal minimum wage during this earlier period.25 Rather than surveying each
cohort annually as they progress through the U.S. school system, I turn to retrospective
reports of educational attainment. For this information I use the 1-percent samples drawn
from the 1980, 1970, and 1960 decennial censuses available from the University of
Minnesota’s IPUMS project [Ruggles et al 2008].26 Each individual was asked to report
24

Unfortunately, Hawaii’s data cannot be separated from the data for Washington and Alaska. New
Jersey’s pre-Carter increase was in January 1975 during the middle of the Nixon round. New York and
California’s increases in October and November 1976 came directly between the Nixon round (May 1974January 1976) and the Carter Four Step (January 1978-January 1981). Thus California and New York
experienced an increase every single year from 1974 to 1981. For New Jersey and the states that did not
exceed the federal standard there were also changes every year with the exception of 1977. Thus it would
be difficult to discern a distinctly different pattern for these three states.
25

There were few states with minimum wage increases that exceeded the federal minimum before 1970.
See Figure 3.
26

I cannot use the 1990 or subsequent census samples because they define educational attainment
differently than the earlier censuses. In particular they consider the Generalized Educational Development
(GED) degree (or high-school equivalency diploma) to be equivalent to graduating from twelfth grade and
Richard Sutch
Minimum Wage Draft September 1, 2010

to the Census Bureau the highest grade of school ever attended. The micro-level data
files report the highest grade of school completed and also identify respondents who
began but did not finish the grade. From these reports I can calculate the number of years
of high school attended by each respondent. Constraining attention to native-born
individuals greater than 20 years old and less than 66 at each census, I was able to
produce the cohort data displayed in Figure 7.27 The line at the right, reproduces the CPS
data for males shown earlier in Figure 4. Another line covering 1935 to 1975 presents
the data for males constructed from the responses to the 1980 census for the high school
cohorts of 1938 to 1976. A third line is constructed from the 1970 census and the fourth
line, pushing the series back to the high school class of 1918, is based on responses to the
1960 census.

Two things are obvious from this graph. First, there was a very rapid rise in high
school attendance between 1918 and 1968 (from 1.47 years at the earlier date to 3.73
years at the later date) which was followed by the relatively slower growth evident after
1968. The dramatic educational advance associated with the spread of the high school
after World War I is well known and it suggests that a long-run secular process was at
work [Goldin and Katz 2008: Chapter 1]. The other point that the plot illustrates is that
as each cohort aged from one census to the next its members seem to have reported more
high school experience than they did at the previous census. Some of this upward drift of
the trend line measured at different census dates might be due to selective mortality. At
least, we might suppose that the better educated are healthier and live longer than lesseducated members of their cohort. But surely most of this educational attainment
inflation is caused by selective memory (not to say prevarication) as one is further
removed from one’s high school days. For this reason we tend to favor the census reports
from the respondents when they were younger.
earning a high school diploma. For a discussion of the problems this change created see Heckman,
LaFontaine, and Rodriguez [2008].
27

The foreign born are excluded because I cannot know whether they attended high school in the United
States or a foreign country. When examining the CPS data this was not a concern since we were examining
residents of the U.S. attending school (or not) in October of each year.
Richard Sutch

In this analysis I focus on the minimum wage increases between 1950 and 1968.
Because of the sharp upward gradient of the lines in Figure 7, it is clear that there is more
influencing high school attendance than the increases in the minimum wage. To better
highlight the impact of the minimum wage changes, I have removed the trend from the
data and analyzed the residuals from the trend.28 I focused on the data from the census
sample immediately following each increase. I examined four rounds of federal
minimum wage increases between 1947 and 1974.29 As before, I labeled them with the
name of the President who signed the bill.
Truman Increase – 1950
25 January 1950

from $0.40

Enacted: October 1949
to $0.75

Eisenhower Increase – 1956
1 March 1956
from $0.75

Enacted: August 1955
to $1.00

Kennedy Round – 1961-1963
3 September 1961
from $1.00
3 September 1963

Enacted: May 1961
to $1.15
to $1.25

Johnson Round – 1967-1968
1 February 1967
from $1.25
1 February 1968

Enacted: September 1966
to $1.40
to $1.60

For the Truman, Eisenhower, and Kennedy treatments the residuals from trend show a
marked increase above the trend, supporting the hypothesis of a positive impact of these
changes on school attendance. The Johnson round is less clear. If the treated cohorts
were thought to be 1967-1970, rather than 1968-1971, then the fit would be better. I
could rationalize that by noting that the Johnson bill was signed in September 1966 so it
might be that the cohort that was 17 (largely seniors) in 1967 knew that the increase was
28

The trends were estimated separately for each IPUMS sample. They are piecewise linear and pass
through the observations for 1951, 1957, 1962, and 1974. These dates were chosen to coincide with the
first cohort to experience one of the minimum wage increases while 14- to 16-years old. However, 1968
was skipped since the profile from the 1980 IPUMS indicated there was no upward trend between 1963 and
1974.
29

See Table 1. For a discussion of the political and legislative history of these episodes see Waltman
[2000: 34-41]. For the dates of enactment and other details see Stark [1949], “Eisenhower Signs” [1955],
“Kennedy Signs” [1961], and Frankel [1966].

coming. However, I also should note that there was a significant break in the trends rates
displayed in Figure 7 sometime in the mid-1960s and the results are sensitive to the way
in which I have modeled the trend.

I can approximate the magnitude of the educational cascade induced by changes
in the minimum wage between 1950 and 1972 by sequentially subtracting the estimated
residuals from the IPUMS series on the number of years of high school attended. This is
done at the left side of Figure 8. The line at the top is the original data based on the 1980
IPUMS and the lower line indicates what the trend might have been had there been no
minimum wage changes. At the right-hand side of the figure the actual and the
counterfactual series are extended to 2003 using the CPS data illustrated in Figure 4. If
our approximations to the magnitude of the minimum-wage ratchet is accepted, then the
average number of years of high school enrollment would have risen to only 3.52 years,
rather than 3.73 years, for men born in 1951 (17 in 1968). Thereafter enrollment rates
would have trended down to about 3.2 years for the cohort born in 1986 (17 in 2003),
rather than slowly rising to around 3.9 years. This is an astonishing result. The
cumulative effect of the minimum wage increases beginning in 1950 was to add 0.7 years
to the average high school experience of men born in 1986.

Conclusion
Gavin Wright has suggested that the productivity slowdown that began after 1968 was
associated with the rise of “flexible labor markets” and the dismantling of high-wage
labor market institutions that prevailed in the preceding half century [Wright 2006: 152153]. The erosion of the real minimum wage after 1968 (displayed in Figure 1) was,
according to Wright, a consequence of this labor market “regime change” from one
complex of policies to another. Frank Levy and Peter Temin in this volume characterize
the labor-market policies associated with the high-wage regime “the Treaty of Detroit”
and the flexible labor market policies which followed “the Washington Consensus”
[Levy and Temin 2010: 24-25 in ms]. One element of the Washington Consensus was
the desirability (or acceptability) of low minimum wages [pp. 10, 20, and 25 in ms]. The
Richard Sutch
Minimum Wage Draft September 1, 2010
Page 20 of 38

downward trend of the counterfactual enrollment I have illustrated in Figure 8 is
consistent with the view that a regime change took place and that labor market policy is
relevant for long-run economic performance, just as Rosenbloom and Sundstrom argue in
this volume [2010].
Why the regime change? Levy and Temin argue that policy makers, “unable to
comprehend the macroeconomic causes of distress” (high unemployment, inflation,
economic inefficiency), turned to microeconomic tinkering, dissolving the long-standing
understandings embodied in “the Treaty of Detroit” [p. 25 in ms]. The policy makers
might have been influenced by that old argument of George Stigler [1946] and the
campaign led by Milton Friedman that the minimum wage made the unemployment
problem (particularly the teenage unemployment problem) intractable. If so, I might add
that the policy makers responsible were also lacking in microeconomic understanding.
As Card and Krueger make clear, Stigler and Friedman were wrong. Their
microeconomic theory was too simplified and was inconsistent with the macroeconomics
of causes of unemployment [Card and Kruger 1995: Chapter 11].

The main contribution of this essay, as I see it, is to demonstrate the plausibility
of the argument that increases in the minimum wage would increase the amount of
schooling attained by a cohort that experiences the increases while in high school. If my
empirical estimates are near correct,30 the impact is numerically significant and likely to
be economically important. This is not to say that the manipulation of the minimum
wage is the most effective, efficient, or fair policy to achieve an increase in high school
attendance. But, further increases in the minimum wage large enough to counteract the
30

Of course, my measure of the impact of the educational cascade induced by increases in the minimum
wage is only approximate since it is based on several strong assumptions. My procedures for controlling
for the underlying trend in the pre-1972 data and the assumption that there are no omitted variables that
would influence the results are the most obvious issues. On the other hand, my own hunch is that my
preliminary results are likely to underestimate the full effect. High on any list of omitted variables to add
are controls for state differences in compulsory education laws and a variable to measure the impact of
unemployment rates on the decision to remain in school. Omission of these variables is likely to attenuate
the effect I am trying to assess.

decline in the real value of the minimum wage are likely to be beneficial and
(Republicans willing) likely to be politically achievable.

High school dropout rates remain unacceptably high, particularly for minority
teenagers. A reconsideration of the impact of the minimum wage would be a welcome
component of any reorientation of government policy that attempts to deal with our
current economic distress (high unemployment, deteriorating educational attainment).

Appendix: Specifying the Affected Cohorts: The Nixon Round
The Nixon round consisted of three increases in the minimum wage; the first on 1 May
1974, the second on 1 January 1975, and the third on 1 January 1976. Note first that the
typical ages of high school attendees in October was 14 to 17, though a significant
fraction of 18-year olds (21.3 percent) were also still in high school. The Appendix table
gives the birth cohort for each age class, 13 through 20, beginning with the October
survey taken before the first rate change (and before President Nixon signed the wage
bill31) continuing through the October that followed the third increase. I consider the
cohorts of 1958 and 1959 to be the most directly affected by the Nixon round. The
cohort born in 1957 aged from 16 to 17 years over the year that the first minimum wage
change took place. But most 17-year olds would be seniors (12th graders) in 1974, so this
cohort had only a brush with the Nixon round. The 1958 cohort on the other hand
experienced both the first and second increases before they reached 17. The 1959 cohort
experienced all three boosts in the minimum during their high school years. 32
I would expect the 1959 cohort to experience more years of high school education
than either the 1957 or 1958 cohorts. This is, indeed, what we find. The 1959 cohort
(they were 17 in 1976) reported 3.78 years. The 1958 cohort logged on average 3.69
years of high school enrollment by the time they were 20. The 1957 cohort reported 3.68
years.

31

President Nixon had vetoed the bill the previous September and his change of heart was somewhat of a
surprise. “But politicians in both parties suggested that, with possible impeachment hanging over his head,
Mr. Nixon could not afford to risk a second veto” [Apple 1974].
32

Recall that the 1958 birth cohort is calculated by subtracting the age of the respondent in October from
the year that the survey was conducted. Thus the two cohorts of 1958-1959 consist of those born between
15 October 1957 and 14 October 1959.

Ba4422-4425. The original table was contributed by Susan B. Carter

Documentation
The federal minimum wage was established with the passage of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) of 1938. The
FSLA was the capstone of the New Deal legislation designed to end the Great Depression of the 1930s. The 1938 Act
applied to workers engaged in interstate commerce or in the production of goods for interstate commerce.
Series 1.1. Indicates the new minimum level at each successive change. All increases in the minimum wage rate
beginning in 1978 covered all non-exempt workers.
Series 1.2. The 1961 amendments to the FLSA extended coverage to employees in large retail and service enterprises
as well as to local transit, construction, and to gasoline service station employees. The level of the minimum for these
workers is shown in this series. After January 30, 1968 the rate for these employees matched that for all covered,
nonexempt workers under the 1938 Act. In 1990, the new law raised the annual dollar volume test for enterprise
coverage. A grandfather clause was established to protect employees who no longer met the tests for individual
coverage, whose employers were covered as of March 31, 1990, but who would have become exempt from coverage
with the new volume test.
Series 1.3-1.4. The 1966 amendments to the FSLA extended coverage to state and local government employees of
hospitals, nursing homes, and schools, and to laundries, dry cleaners, and large hotels, motels, restaurants, and farms.
Subsequent amendments extended coverage to the remaining federal, state, and local government employees who were
not protected in 1966, to certain workers in retail and service trades previously exempted, and to certain domestic
workers in private household employment. After December 31, 1976 the minimum for non-farm workers covered by
the 1966 amendments matched that for all covered, non-exempt workers under the 1938 Act. The minimum for farm
workers matched that for all covered, nonexempt workers after December 31, 1977.

Series 1.5. Beginning April 1, 1990 a youth subminimum wage (“training wage”) was established by the 1989
amendments at 85 percent of the statutory minimum wage (but not less than $3.35 per hour) that applied to employees
under 20 years of age during their first 90 continuous days of employment. This provision expired after March 31,
1993. Under the 1996 amendments a youth subminimum wage of $4.25 per hour was established beginning October
1,996 that applied to employees under 20 years ofage during their first 90 consecutive calendar days of employment.
The terms of the two youth subminimum wage plans were confirmed by newspaper accounts at the time. See David E.
Rosenbaum, “Bush and Congress Reach Accord Raising Minimum Wage to $4.25,” New York Times, November 1,
1989, and Eric Schmitt, “Bill to Increase Minimum Pay Clears Hurdle In a New Deal,” New York Times, August 1,
1996.
