Recovery from the Great Depression: The Farm Channel in Spring 1933

ABSTRACT
From March to July 1933, industrial production rose 57 percent. We show that an important
source of recovery was the effect of dollar devaluation on farm prices, incomes, and
consumption. Devaluation immediately raised traded crop prices, and auto sales grew more
rapidly in states and counties most exposed to these price increases. The response was amplified
in counties with more severe farm debt burdens. For plausible assumptions about farmers’
relative MPC, the incidence of higher farm prices, and the aggregate multiplier, this redistribution
to farmers accounted for a substantial portion of spring 1933 growth. This farm channel thus
provides an example of how the distributional consequences of macroeconomic policies can have
large aggregate effects. That recovery in 1933 benefited from redistribution to farmers suggests
an important limitation to the use of 1933 as a guide to the effects of monetary regime changes in
other circumstances.

“[T]he depression in the manufacturing industry of the country is due chiefly to
the fact that agricultural products generally have been selling below the cost of
production, and thereby destroyed the purchasing power in the domestic market
of nearly half of all our people. We are going to restore the purchasing power of
the farmer.” - Franklin D. Roosevelt, campaign speech in Atlanta, Georgia, 24
October 1932.1

1 Introduction
From its low point in March 1933, seasonally adjusted industrial production rose 57
percent in four months, the most rapid four months of industrial production growth on
record. As shown in figure 1, in these four months the U.S. economy recovered from two years
of the Depression.2 We argue that an important driver of this extraordinary recovery was
the effect of devaluation on farm prices, incomes, and consumption. We call this mechanism
the farm channel.
As the quote beginning the paper suggests, the importance of farmers for recovery was
much emphasized in the 1930s. But with the exception of Temin and Wigmore (1990)—
which inspired this paper—it has not figured prominently in the modern literature. Our goal
is to document the farm channel’s operation and its relevance to the aggregate economy’s
recovery. We do so in three steps. First, we show that crop prices rose rapidly in spring
1933, and that this increase was in part caused by devaluation. Second, we show that auto
sales and income grew much more in farm areas of the country, particularly in those areas
most burdened by farm mortgage debt. Third, we discuss why the farm channel likely
accounted for a substantial portion of aggregate spring 1933 growth. Our findings illustrate
how microeconomic heterogeneity—in this case between farmers and nonfarmers—can shape
the impact of macroeconomic policies.
We start our analysis of the farm channel in section 2 by examining the 1933 path of
prices and production of all major farm products. The data show a large increase in crop

Industrial production data are from FRED series INDPRO. We verify in appendix A that rapid recovery
is a feature not only of the industrial production data, but also of other aggregate economic indicators. Our
conclusion that the economy indeed grew extraordinarily rapidly in spring 1933 matches that of Taylor and
Neumann (2016).

prices after devaluation, with much smaller price increases for (nontraded) livestock and dairy
products. An analysis of daily farm spot and futures prices around the announcement of the
U.S. departure from the gold standard provides evidence for a causal role of devaluation in
driving crop price increases. Importantly, this was an increase in real crop prices, since the
CPI rose only modestly.
In section 3, we examine consumption choices in farm relative to nonfarm areas. Using
monthly state and annual county auto sales data, we find that new auto sales in spring
1933 grew much more in farm areas of the country. Our baseline estimates imply that a onestandard-deviation increase in the share of a state’s population living on farms was associated
with a nearly 30 percentage point increase in auto sales growth in spring 1933. The effect is
driven by areas benefitting from higher farm prices in spring 1933, not agricultural areas in
general; conditional on 1932 farm product value per capita in a state, a $1 larger change in
farm product value in spring 1933 is associated with 1-2 percentage points more rapid auto
sales growth. This result holds both within and across states and is robust to a battery of
controls. We focus on new car sales because we observe these data at a monthly frequency for
2

U.S. states and at an annual frequency for U.S. counties, allowing for a more precise analysis
of the farm channel in the crucial spring 1933 window than would be possible with other
economic indicators.3 But we obtain quantitatively similar results from annual state-level
data on new truck sales and electric refrigerator sales.
Given small contributions of net exports to GDP growth in 1933 and 1934, higher farm
product prices primarily redistributed income to farmers from nonfarm households and businesses. It is not a priori obvious that this transfer would be beneficial for the aggregate
economy. A plausible way that higher farm prices could have had aggregate benefits is if
they redistributed income from low marginal propensity to consume (MPC) agents to highMPC agents. A long-standing theoretical literature (e.g., Bewley, 1986; Aiyagari, 1994) and
more recent empirical work (e.g., Mian, Rao, and Sufi, 2013) suggest that debtors are likely
to have a higher MPC than creditors. Since farmers had large mortgage debt burdens in
early 1933, a transfer of income to farmers could have raised aggregate demand. Consistent
with this hypothesis, in section 4 we estimate that the farm channel’s effect on consumption
was largest in those counties where farmers were most encumbered by farm mortgage debt.
Higher farm product prices could also have raised aggregate output through their effect
on the banking sector and inflation expectations. We find that counties more exposed to the
farm channel experienced faster deposit growth. This is indicative of improved bank health
in rural areas, which were among the most hard-hit by the Depression’s banking crises. And
we find narrative evidence that delayed pass-through from higher farm product prices to
final goods prices increased inflation expectations.
In section 5, we gauge the aggregate effect of the farm channel. Guided by a simple heterogeneous agent model, in which farmers gain at the expense of nonfarmers, we extrapolate
from our cross-sectional estimates to an aggregate effect. To do so, we adjust for the extent
to which the cross-sectional estimates reflect reduced consumption by high-MPC consumers
in nonfarm areas and for aggregate general equilibrium effects. Since the form and magnitude of these adjustments rest on assumptions about the structure of the economy, our
calculations are an indicator of the rough magnitude of the effect of the farm channel, not a
precise quantitative estimate. With this caveat in mind, we find that the aggregate effect of
3

the farm channel was large, in the range of 20-60 percent of spring 1933 output growth. We
find a large effect because our cross-sectional estimates indicate a high MPC in farm areas,
the pass-through of higher farm prices to urban workers was incomplete, and the aggregate
spending multiplier was likely large.
Like us, Friedman and Schwartz (1963), Edwards (2015), Edwards (2018), and Rauchway
(2015) emphasize the priority that the Roosevelt administration put on raising the price
of agricultural goods. According to Edwards (2015) p. 20, Henry Morgenthau, head of
the farm relief administration and later treasury secretary, “believed that uncoupling the
value of the dollar from gold was a requisite to increase agricultural prices and, in that
way, bring relief to farmers. His main concern was not gold itself, but relative prices; for
him the goal of policy - and a required step towards recovery - was increasing the price of
agricultural products relative to manufacturing goods.” This is consistent with the view of
George Warren and Frank Pearson (Warren and Pearson, 1935), the former of whom became
an important economic advisor to Roosevelt (Edwards, 2018). Bessler (1996) summarizes
Warren’s views, and both he and Temin and Wigmore (1990) document a close link between
the exchange rate and traded crop prices. Edwards (2017) confirms this link and shows
that expectations of monetary regime change were an important determinant of agricultural
prices in 1933. That crop prices responded more – and more rapidly – than the overall
price level to devaluation also fits with the current understanding that commodity prices are
particularly flexible (Nakamura and Steinsson, 2008), a view formalized in Bordo (1980).
Temin and Wigmore (1990) were the first (and have remained the only) authors in the
modern economics literature to emphasize the importance of farmers for the aggregate economy in 1933. They argue that a weaker dollar led to higher expected inflation and was also
expansionary through its effect on current and expected farm incomes. But they are only
able to provide circumstantial evidence for the importance of higher farm incomes (the farm
channel).4 We build on their work by providing econometric evidence for each stage of the
4

Temin and Wigmore’s principal evidence comes from a state-level regression of the level of auto sales
in all of 1933 on farm income and other income in 1933. They interpret a larger coefficient on farm income
as evidence in support of their hypothesis. While suggestive, this regression has three limitations: first, the
left-hand side variable is the level of auto sales, while their hypothesis is about the growth of auto sales.
Second, the farm income regression coefficient is positive and large for all years from 1932 to 1940, suggesting
that these results are not necessarily informative about events in 1933 per se. Third, the regression uses
annual data, hence it conflates auto sales in the period of interest, spring 1933, with sales later in the year.

farm channel’s operation, and by explicitly considering the general equilibrium implications
of higher farm product prices.
Recent papers on the initial recovery in spring 1933 include Eggertsson (2008), Jalil and
Rua (2016), Sumner (2015), and Taylor and Neumann (2016). These papers credit Roosevelt
with inducing inflation expectations and reducing ex-ante real interest rates, thus stimulating
demand for investment goods and consumer durables. The farm channel we emphasize is
largely distinct from this expectations channel, although higher farm product prices and
resulting higher farm incomes could have contributed to economy-wide expectations of higher
future prices and income.
Our attention to farmers’ debt positions in spring 1933 aligns with the literature emphasizing debt deflation as a cause of the Great Depression. Fisher (1932) and Fisher (1933)
first argued for this mechanism as a cause of the Great Depression, and Fisher (1933) credits
Roosevelt’s policies with ending the debt-deflation cycle. Hamilton (1987, 1992) provide evidence that a significant part of the deflation during the Great Depression was unanticipated,
concluding that debt-deflation and bank failures played an important role in the contraction. And Mishkin (1978) emphasizes the general importance of debt as a determinant of
consumption in the 1930s, though he does not specifically focus on farmers or the MPC.
An older literature emphasized that devaluation may affect output by redistributing income among groups with different MPCs (e.g., Diaz Alejandro, 1965; Krugman and Taylor,
1978), but this literature did not consider the recovery from the Great Depression. Prominent
recent research has emphasized the importance of income redistribution and MPC heterogeneity for the propagation of monetary policy shocks (a partial list includes Auclert, 2017;
Broer, Hansen, Krusell, and Öberg, 2016; Cloyne, Ferreira, and Surico, 2016; Kaplan, Moll,
and Violante, 2018; McKay, Nakamura, and Steinsson, 2016; Werning, 2015). Our results
are complementary in that we stress the distributional effect of dollar depreciation.
Our paper is also relevant to understanding macroeconomic policy at the zero lower
bound. In the United States in spring 1933, short-term interest rates were near zero, and
hence conventional monetary policy was ineffective. Economists continue to debate the extent to which unconventional monetary policy can stimulate an economy in these conditions
(e.g., Woodford, 2012). In these debates, the U.S. experience in 1933 serves as an example
5

of what policy may be able to achieve (Romer, 2014). For instance, the governor of the Bank
of Japan, Haruhiko Kuroda, has used 1933 as a reference point for his ongoing attempts at
a regime change in Japan (Kuroda, 2015). To the extent that recovery in spring 1933 was
helped along by redistribution to high-MPC farmers, however, the spring 1933 analogy may
be an overly optimistic guide to the effect of a monetary regime change alone (Hausman and
Wieland, 2014, 2015).

2 Spring 1933: Relative farm prices rose
Central to our argument for the importance of agriculture in 1933 is the behavior of
agricultural prices. Figure 2 graphs the overall CPI and the BLS index of farm product
prices. From 1932 to 1934, there was relatively little change in the CPI, though it did rise
3 percent between June and July 1933. By contrast, farm product prices rose 40 percent in
the four months from March to July. The figure points to devaluation as a possible cause
of this large price change. In the three months following devaluation on 19 April, the dollar
depreciated by 30 percent relative to the British pound. The exchange rate vis a vis many
other currencies behaved similarly in the April to July period: against the French franc,
the dollar depreciated 34 percent; against the German mark, 36 percent (Survey of Current
Business, 12/33, p. 31). Since prices of traded farm products were set in world markets,
when the dollar depreciated, the dollar price of many farm products rose.
This effect of devaluation on farm prices was no accident; as discussed in the introduction,
raising the relative price of agricultural products was an explicit goal of the Roosevelt administration. Roosevelt himself frequently and publicly emphasized this. The quote beginning
the paper comes from a campaign speech given by Roosevelt in October 1932. As president,
he repeated this message. For instance, in a fireside chat in October 1933, Roosevelt said: “I
do not hesitate to say in the simplest, clearest language of which I am capable, that although
the prices of many products of the farm have gone up and although many farm families are
better off than they were last year, I am not satisfied either with the amount or the extent
of the rise, and that it is definitely a part of our policy to increase the rise and to extend it
to those products which have as yet felt no benefit. If we cannot do this one way we will do

it another. Do it, we will.” 5 Weakening the dollar was part of this strategy. As Friedman
and Schwartz (1963), p. 465 put it: “The aim of the gold policy was to raise the price level
of commodities, particularly farm products and raw materials . . .”
We show that the administration succeeded in this goal; in other words we identify a
causal effect of devaluation on farm prices. To do this, we examine the announcement
effect of the U.S. departure from the gold standard on daily spot and future prices. This
approach complements the analyses in Temin and Wigmore (1990), Bessler (1996), and
Edwards (2017). Temin and Wigmore (1990) show that monthly cotton prices comove closely
with the dollar-pound and the dollar-franc exchange rate from 1930-1936, and they note that
a similar correlation exists for grains. Bessler (1996) conducts a VAR analysis with daily
data on gold, cotton, corn, hog, and lard prices; he concludes that gold price movements
explain most of the 1933 increase in cotton, corn, and lard prices. Edwards (2017) also finds
that commodity prices moved with the dollar. Relative to this prior work, we use a narrower

date range but a broader range of farm products. For the purpose of understanding the
causal effect of devaluation on farm prices, this has the advantage that there are likely fewer
confounding factors in a narrow time window, and that any product-specific shocks average
out over a large number of products.6
We examine daily data on the exchange rate and the price of wheat, cotton, corn, oats,
lard, pork belly, hogs, steers,7 and lambs around the day of devaluation, 19 April. These
data are presented in figure 3. Between noon on 18 April and noon on 20 April, the dollar
depreciated slightly more than 10 percent. Over this period, most crop prices rose by a
similar amount. The exception was wheat, whose price was negatively affected by news on
19 April of beneficial rains in winter wheat-growing areas (Wood, 1933).
Beyond the close co-movement of crop prices with the exchange rate over this narrow
time window, three additional pieces of evidence suggest a causal role for devaluation. First,
for cotton we observe Liverpool, England prices. As shown in figure 3, around the day
of devaluation, Liverpool cotton prices expressed in sterling were nearly unchanged. This
suggests that the change in the dollar price of cotton was a response to devaluation rather
than to other shocks. Second, the prices of hogs, steers, and lambs did not respond to
devaluation. This is likely because most of the dollar value of these animals was nontraded.
So we would not expect their prices to have been affected by devaluation despite the price
response of tradable derivative products (e.g., lard, pork belly).8 Third, narrative evidence
attributes the increase in crop prices to devaluation. The Chicago Tribune (Wood, 1933)
wrote “Yesterday’s [19 April] commodity price advances were attributed almost entirely to
the administration’s announcement of its inflation program and the consequent decline of the
dollar in foreign exchange.” Similarly, the Commercial and Financial Chronicle (4/22/33,
6
Rigobon (2003) proposes a heteroskedasticity-based identification method that may be used to filter out
the influence of confounding factors around events. It requires, however, that only the variances of shocks
change, while the economic structure remains fixed. This is unlikely to be true in our case, since the impact
of demand and supply shocks on the exchange rate almost certainly changed after the United States left the
Gold Standard.

On the lack of relationship between international pork product prices and U.S. hog prices, see Taylor
(1932), particularly p. 203. The lack of a price response of lamb is more puzzling, since wool futures prices
rose after devaluation (Commercial and Financial Chronicle, 4/22/1933, p. 2818). It is possible that the
steadiness of lamb prices on 20 April and 21 April reflects idiosyncratic supply factors on those days (Wall
Street Journal, 4/21/1933, p. 32 and 4/22/1933 p. 27). Large receipts and low quality may also have
contributed to falling steer prices on 20 April (Wall Street Journal, 4/21/1933, p. 32).

pp. 2820, 2823) credits the U.S. departure from the gold standard with raising cotton and
wheat prices.
To see whether the price effect of devaluation was expected to persist, figure 4 shows
the behavior of wheat, cotton, corn, and oats futures prices around the day of devaluation.
These are the same data used by Hamilton (1992) to measure inflation expectations in the
1930s. Like their spot prices, wheat and cotton futures prices rose significantly, even for the
furthest dated contracts. This suggests that people believed the price effect of devaluation
would persist.9
9

The fact that futures and spot prices moved by similar amounts suggests that a change in carrying costs
cannot account for the movement in futures prices around the day of devaluation. Also, farm land prices
rose 4 percent between 1 March 1933 and 1 March 1934, suggesting that at least some of the increase in
farm prices and incomes was expected to be long-lasting (Stauber and Regan, 1935, table 1, pp. 6-7).

Thus far we have focused on an analysis of daily prices in a narrow window around devaluation, since this provides the best setting for identifying the causal effect of devaluation.
But what mattered for farmers was the path of prices and production over the entire spring.
Table 1 summarizes prices and production for the 12 farm products with greater than $100
million of farm product value in 1932.10 The top panel provides data for crops and the
bottom panel for animal products. For reference, the first column shows the dollar / pound
exchange rate. This makes clear that in the second and third quarters of 1933 crop prices
rose as the dollar weakened.
The mechanism through which devaluation affected farm prices is clearest for the traded
crops of cotton, wheat, and tobacco. As Friedman and Schwartz (1963, p. 466) describe:
The prices of [traded] commodities in foreign currencies were determined by world
demand and supply and were affected by events in the United States only insofar
10

Farm product value is physical production times the producer price. In addition to the products in the
table, butterfat had a farm product value of greater than $100 million. We exclude it from the table because
it is a by-product of milk production.

Notes and sources: The exchange rate is not seasonally adjusted. Prices are producer prices (prices received
by farmers); annual prices are unweighted calendar year averages. Farm product value equals physical
production times price. Farm product value and production figures are for the crop year, not the calendar
year. The presence or absence of AAA intervention is based on facts reported in Nourse, Davis, and Black
(1937) and United States Department of Agriculture (1934a). For further notes and source details, see

as these, in turn, affected the amounts supplied and demanded by the United
States. Even then, such prices were affected much less than in proportion to the
changes in U.S. sales and purchases. Hence, the decline in the foreign exchange
value of the dollar meant a roughly proportional rise in the dollar price of such
commodities, which is, of course, what did happen to the dollar prices of cotton,
petroleum products, leaf tobacco, wheat, and similar items.
It is less obvious how devaluation raised the price of other crops. A likely channel through
which devaluation affected the prices of the principal nontraded grains, corn and oats, was
through substitution. For instance, wheat, corn, and oats could all be used as animal feed
(Davis, 1935, p. 23; Taylor, 1932, p. 129). Substitution between grains meant that as a
weaker dollar increased the price of traded grains such as wheat, it likely also put upward
pressure on the price of nontraded grains such as corn and oats. Indeed, Taylor (1932, p.
170) identifies the price of wheat as one of the determinants of the price of corn.
Accepting that substitution can explain the response of nontraded crop prices to devaluation, a puzzle remains: why did crop prices rise by more than the dollar weakened?
Mechanically, this is in part explained by rising British pound prices of many crops. For
instance, Liverpool prices in sterling of imported wheat rose 24 percent between March and
July 1933, and the sterling price of Indian cotton rose 17 percent.11 A reason to credit international factors with the large increase in crop prices is the lack of response of nontraded
animal product prices shown in panel B of table 1. Unlike crop prices, animal product prices
rose only moderately in spring 1933. This fits with the lack of response of daily hog, steer,
and lamb prices to devaluation shown in figure 3.
A likely contributing factor to the increase in international crop prices was global economic recovery. Between 1932 and 1933, world industrial production rose 13 percent (Woytinsky and Woytinsky, 1953, table 427, p. 1002), and farm prices are expected to react quickly
to aggregate demand (Bordo, 1980). In addition to international factors, two U.S. specific
supply shocks may have contributed to higher prices of certain crops. First, drought reduced
production of grains (United States Department of Agriculture, 1934b,a). This may explain

why in spring 1933 the price of corn in the United States rose much more than the price of
Argentinian corn in Liverpool.12 (Recall that unlike wheat, little U.S. corn was traded.) Second, even for those crops (like cotton) for which production did not decline, there may have
been expectations of future production declines driven by Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA) intervention. However, we observe little change in Liverpool cotton prices
when the AAA passed the House (22 March 1933), the Senate (28 April), or was signed by
Roosevelt (12 May). (Domestic cotton prices rose by 5 percent on 29 April in part reflecting
a 2 percent decline in the dollar, but not on the other days.) In the following sections, we
will go to substantial effort to control for the possible confounding effects of the drought and
the AAA.
Figure 5 shows that higher real farm prices translated quickly into higher real farm
incomes. Deflated by the CPI, the Department of Agriculture’s seasonally adjusted index of

Between March and July 1933, the wholesale price of corn in Chicago rose 115 percent, while the

income from crops rose 182 percent from March 1933 to July 1933; that of total farm income
(crop and animal products) deflated by the CPI rose 99 percent. On a non-seasonally
adjusted basis, total real farm income was higher in June and July 1933 than it had been in
any month after October 1931 (U.S. Department of Commerce, 1936, p. 9, U.S. Department
of Commerce, 1934a, p. 19). As noted by Temin and Wigmore (1990), higher farm prices
led quickly to higher farm incomes in part because farmers sold crops in storage. The stock
of wheat on farms, for instance, fell from 182 million bushels to 82 million bushels between
1 April 1933 and 1 July 1933 (United States Department of Agriculture, 1936, table 7, p.
14). By comparison, total wheat production in 1933 was 529 million bushels (United States
Department of Agriculture, 1936, table 1, p. 6).13
To sum up, the evidence strongly suggests that devaluation accounted for a significant
part of the increase in crop prices, and thus the increase in farm income, in spring 1933.

3 Farm consumption
We now examine the effect of higher farm prices on farm consumption. This is a crosssectional exercise in which we compare consumption in areas with more farmers or larger
increases in farm income to areas with fewer farmers or smaller increases in farm income. In
sections 4 and 5, we will consider national general equilibrium effects of higher farm product
prices.
We estimate cross-sectional regressions of the form:
%∆Auto salesi,Spring 1933 = β0 + β1 Agricultural exposurei + γ 0 Xi + εi ,

(1)

where %∆Auto salesi,Spring 1933 is auto sales growth in spring 1933, “Agricultural exposure”
is a state or county i’s exposure to the farm channel in spring 1933, and X is a set of control
variables. We use new auto sales as our main indicator of local economic conditions. Unlike
other economic indicators, auto sales were reported at the state and county level and at
reasonably high frequency: monthly at the state level and annually at the county level.
13

In addition to stocks of wheat held on farms, there were also substantial stocks held commercially, e.g.
by elevators and mills (United States Department of Agriculture, 1936, table 14, p. 18). The extent to which
the sale of these stocks directly raised farmers’ incomes is unclear.

14

We expect that β1 is positive, since higher farm prices redistributed income towards
farmers. Also important for our purposes is the size of β1 ; it determines the aggregate
importance of the farm channel in our analysis in section 5.
Importantly, β1 may not be an estimate of the effect of devaluation alone. For example,
expectations of other agricultural policies may have differentially affected farm and nonfarm
regions. To ensure that we are primarily picking up a devaluation effect, we check that auto
sales grow disproportionally in regions growing traded crops or close substitutes, and we use
a variety of control variables. Even so, we cannot separate the effect of devaluation from the
effect of other shocks that disproportionally fell on traded farm goods and that our control
variables do not capture.
3.1 Cross-state results We collected data on new passenger car sales by state and month
from the Automotive Daily News Review and Reference Book (1935, pp. 22-23). Appendix D
provides further details on these data and their accuracy. We seasonally adjust the monthly
state auto sales using twelve monthly dummies, excluding the year 1933 to avoid conflating
the rapid recovery in spring with a seasonal effect.14
The ideal independent variable would exactly measure the portion of the spring 1933
income change that was due to locally exogenous farm price increases. Since no such exact
measure exists, we consider proxy variables. Simplest is the percent of local residents living
on a farm. This measure has the disadvantage that many farmers were engaged in the
production of livestock and dairy products whose prices moved relatively little in 1933.
Thus, we also look at the value of crops sold per capita in 1929.
Figure 6a shows a scatter plot of the farm share of the population and the seasonallyadjusted percentage change in car sales from the 1932:Q4-1933:Q1 quarterly average to
1933:Q3. We show the change between quarterly averages since single month values have
large amounts of noise that is more likely due to idiosyncratic variation than it is to macro
shocks. For the base period, we choose a longer, two-quarter period since real farm income
and industrial production changed little over these months (figures 5 and 1), and since

Notes: Auto sales growth is measured as the percent change in seasonally-adjusted auto sales from the
1932:Q4-1933:Q1 quarterly average to 1933:Q3. The straight line is the OLS regression line. Sources: Auto
sales - see text. Farm share - the 1930 Census as reported in Haines and ICPSR (2010). Crops sold - the

averaging over more months means filtering out more noise. We end the calculation in the
third quarter of 1933, since this largely avoids contaminating the effect of higher crop prices
on auto sales with the effect of AAA payments on auto sales.15
In figure 6a, there is a clear positive relationship, with the farm population share explaining a substantial fraction of the cross-state variation in auto sales growth (R2 = 0.31).
Column (1) of table 2 shows the corresponding regression. The slope of the regression line,
1.7, is economically large and significantly different from zero with a t-statistic of 4.5. It implies that a one-standard-deviation increase in the farm share (17 percent) raised auto sales
growth by 29.2 percentage points (1.70 × 17.2 = 29.2). Furthermore, the effect is almost
certainly large; the 95 percent confidence interval ranges from 16.2 percentage points to 42.2
percentage points. As another benchmark, a coefficient of 1.7 means that if a state’s farm
share rose from 11 percent (that in California) to 50 percent (that in North Carolina), then
auto sales growth would rise 66.3 percentage points ((50 − 11) × 1.70 = 66.3).
Figure 6b replaces farm share with the per capita value of crops sold in 1929. Again,
the relationship is positive and explains a large fraction of the variation (R2 = 0.36). The
regression coefficient of 0.79 (t-statistic 6.3), shown in column (3) of table 2, means that
a $1 increase in the value of crops sold per capita increased car sales by 0.79 percentage
points. The standard deviation of the per capita value of crops sold was $39.7, so a onestandard-deviation increase in crops sold per person raised spring 1933 auto sales growth
by 31.5 percentage points. This is nearly identical to the effect of a one-standard-deviation
increase in farm population share. And again, the relatively narrow 95 percent confidence
interval (21.5 percentage points to 41.5 percentage points) suggests that this effect was
almost certainly large.
The scatter plots also highlight several features of the farm channel. First, with the
exception of Michigan, the ten states with the most rapid auto sales growth were all either
in the top quintile of wheat production per capita (North Dakota, Kansas, Montana, Idaho,
Nebraska, and Oklahoma) or in the top quintile of cotton production per capita (Alabama,
South Carolina, and Georgia). Relatedly, the most rapid auto sales growth was not con15

In the third quarter of 1933, AAA payments totaled $80.8 million (Nourse et al. (1937), appendix C,
table V, p. 588); this can be compared to average quarterly farm personal income in 1933 of $700 million
(BEA regional data, table SA4).

centrated in one specific region of the country, and there was substantial variation within
regions. Second, farm share of the population and crops sold per capita were not strongly
correlated with population; Texas was a large-population state highly exposed to the farm
channel, whereas New Hampshire was a small-population state little exposed to the farm
channel. The overall correlation between farm share and state population was -0.28; between
crops sold per capita and state population, -0.34.

fact that the coefficients in columns (2) and (4) are similar to those in columns (1) and (3)
shows that we are not conflating the farm channel with other variables that could correlate
with agricultural exposure.

Note: Quartiles are based on 1930 farm population share. They are constructed by first indexing each state
to 100 for 1932:Q4-1933:Q1 and then averaging across states in a quartile. Sources: Auto sales - see text.
Farm share - the 1930 Census as reported in Haines and ICPSR (2010).

Next we check that we are not wrongly extrapolating from pre-existing trends in agricultural states. We group states into quartiles based on their 1930 farm population share. We
then base each states’ auto sales at 100 for 1932:Q4-1933:Q1 and average across all states
in the quartile. Figure 7 plots the evolution of auto sales in each quartile in 1932 and 1933.
While low farm-share states and high farm-share states followed roughly similar trends up to
March 1933, thereafter there is a clear divergence, as auto sales in more agricultural states
grew faster.
Farm share of the population and crops sold per capita are a proxy for the positive effect
of higher farm prices on local income. To better measure the income effect of the price shock
in locality i we calculate:
16
X
1
Change farm product value per capitai =
farm product valuei,j,1932 ×%∆pricej .
populationi j=1

(2)

Here 1932 farm product value in location i for farm product j equals the quantity of the
product produced in that locality times the national price (Qi,j,1932 × Pj,1932 ). We define
19

%∆pricej =

Pj,1933:Q3 −(Pj,1932:Q4 +Pj,1933:Q1 )/2
,
(Pj,1932:Q4 +Pj,1933:Q1 )/2

consistent with our timing of auto sales growth.16

In equation (2), we deliberately omit data on 1933 farm production, since local supply conditions are not locally exogenous. For the same reason, we use national prices throughout.17
Columns (5) and (6) examine the effect of this measure on the spring 1933 change in auto
sales. The coefficients mean that a $1 increase in per capita farm product value is associated
with a 0.7 percentage point increase in auto sales. We can obtain stronger evidence on the
farm channel by controlling for the value of 1932 farm production. Doing so means the
regression compares states similar in agricultural intensity but differentially treated by the
spring 1933 farm price changes. Columns (7) and (8) show that the change in farm product
value alone accounts for the faster recovery. By contrast, holding the change in farm product
value fixed, higher agricultural exposure is associated with weaker car sales growth. As in
columns (1) to (4), in columns (5) to (8) we easily reject a zero effect of a $1 change in farm
product value; t-statistics range from 2.4 to 3.6.
Using the estimates in columns (7) and (8) of table 2, one can perform a back-of-theenvelope calculation of the local dollar amount of spending on cars in response to a $1 change
in farm value. Spending in locality i on cars in response to a $1 change in farm product
value is:
Spendingi = β1 × Car Sales1932p.c. × Pcar ,

(3)

where Pcar is the average price of a car in 1933.18 Per capita U.S. car sales in 1932 were
0.0088, and the average retail value of a car sold was $725.19 Thus with the coefficient of
1.75 percentage points in column (8), Spendingi = .0175 × 0.0088 × $725 = $0.11; that is,
we find spending of 11 cents on new cars for every $1 increase in farm product value. The
uncertainty in our estimate of β1 implies a 95 percent confidence interval of 4.9 cents to 17.4
16
The data we use in calculating equation 2 are detailed in appendix C.2. Crop quantities are for the crop
year.
17
We also estimated the regression using state-level farm prices to construct our measure of farm product
value in 1932. Results are quantitatively similar.
18
β1 measures the percent change in car purchases per annual dollar flow of farm income per person, %∆
cars per annual $/p.c.. Multiplying by annual car sales per person converts the units to the annual change
in car purchases per annual dollar flow of farm income, annual ∆ cars per annual $. Further multiplying by
the price yields the annual dollar change in the value of car purchases per annual dollar flow of farm income,
annual ∆ car value per annual $.

Unfortunately, a clean quantitative interpretation of the dollar spending response is limited by three factors. First, this spending response is not a marginal propensity to consume
(MPC). It measures spending in a treated state relative to a non-treated state. Because
of spillovers across households it will generally not be equal to a household MPC. Second,
since our measurement of the change in farm product value includes only major crops and
livestock products, it likely underestimates the actual dollar change in farm product value.
We use 16 farm products in equation 2, accounting for roughly 80 percent of total U.S.
farm product value, so we suspect that the resulting bias is small.21 Third, and likely more
important, the right hand side variable is the change in farm product value, not the change
in farm income. As stated above, the farm product value of product j is pricej × quantityj .
Across all farm products j, farm product values need not sum to farm income. Consider,
for example, the case of a farmer growing corn to feed pigs and then obtaining income from
selling the pigs. If the price of corn rises, the income of the farmer will go up only insofar as
the price of pigs also rises. But farm value will increase along with the price of corn. Since
farm value exceeds farm income, the response of car sales to a given change in farm product
value will be below the response of car sales to a given change in farm income.
Acknowledging these difficulties in interpretation, two comparisons may help to illustrate
the magnitude of the spending response we find. First, in 1932, total spending on new motor
vehicles was 1.2 percent of all consumption spending, so spending of 11 cents on new cars
per dollar change in farm value is consistent with a substantial overall consumption response
(NIPA table 2.4.5). Second, this response is also consistent with Hausman’s (2016a) estimates of the 1936 veterans’ bonus’ impact on new car spending. In a cross-state regression,
Hausman (2016a) estimates a local increase in new car spending of 25-35 cents per $1 of
veterans’ bonus received. That this number is larger than the 11 cent result for farm product
20

When we normalize the change in farm product value by lagged car sales as opposed to population, these
estimates are smaller although still large relative to the share of cars in consumption. The mean estimate
in the state data is 2.4 cents with a 95 percent confidence interval of -1.6 cents to 6.4 cents. And the mean
estimate in the county data is 4.0 cents with a 95 percent confidence interval of 1.1 cents to 6.9 cents. Note
that there are other sources of uncertainty in this spending estimate. For instance, we are using an average
price for cars sold in 1933 which may not be equal to the price of the marginal car sold.

The 80 percent figure is based on the data for 1934 in United States Department of Agriculture (1936),

value is as expected given the mismeasurement of farm product value relative to farm income
discussed above, and given the much larger importance of cars in consumption in 1935-36
versus in 1932-33: in 1932 new motor vehicles were 1.2 percent of all consumption; in 1935
they were 2.7 percent.
3.2 Robustness We next address three potential concerns. First, a natural question is
whether auto sales always grew more rapidly in spring in states with large populations living
on farms or high crop values per person. If farm states saw more rapid auto sales growth
in years when there was no dollar devaluation or change in crop prices, then the preceding
results would not be evidence about the effects of the farm channel in spring 1933. Figure 8
shows coefficients and two standard error bands from regressions of spring auto sales growth
on farm share or crops sold for each year from 1930 to 1934 using the specification in columns
(2) and (4) of table 2. The large, positive, and statistically significant effect on auto sales
growth is unique to 1933.
The presence of non-zero effects in years other than 1933 is unsurprising; we would expect
22

many shocks to differentially affect farm and nonfarm states, especially during the turbulent
Great Depression years. In particular, the negative coefficients in 1930 and 1931 likely reflect
the relative decline in farm income in those years. This decline in farm income was not due
to an exchange rate movement, but as in 1933, it can be explained by a change in the
relative price of farm products; between 1929 and 1931, the CPI fell 11 percent, while farm
product prices fell 38 percent (FRED series CPIAUCNS and M04058USM350NNBR). What
is reassuring about the results in figure 8 is the relative magnitude of the effect in spring
1933 and the lack of consistently positive effects in other years.
A second potential concern is that the positive relationship between new auto sales and
agricultural exposure is only driven by small states. Based on a visual inspection of the
scatter plots (figures 6a and 6b), we noted above that this was unlikely. A more formal test
is to estimate specification (1) using population-weighted OLS. Appendix table B.1 reports
results: estimates are generally similar or moderately smaller.
Finally, one may be concerned about the effect of seasonal adjustment on our estimates.
We have only five years to estimate seasonals (1929-32 and 1934),22 and so our estimates
of the seasonal factors are imprecise. In appendix table B.2 we report estimates with the
dependent variable measured as the percent change in auto sales from the fourth quarter of
1932 to the fourth quarter of 1933. We see similar or larger effects.
3.3 Cross-county results The state-level regressions establish that there was a strong
positive relationship between auto sales growth and farm exposure in spring 1933. But the
small cross-state sample inevitably imposes limits on the analysis. In a cross-state sample,
we cannot control for all possible state-specific confounders (state fixed effects), nor do we
have the statistical power to examine the relationship between farm debt and the spending
response. The latter issue will be a focus of the following section. Here we repeat the statelevel analysis of the previous section at the county-level, taking advantage of the much larger
sample to both control for more variables and to consider alternative specifications.
County-level data on the percent change in auto sales between 1932 and 1933 are provided
22

We do not have access to monthly data before 1929, and the seasonals are different after 1934, because
in 1935 auto manufacturers changed from introducing new models in January to introducing new models in
October or November (Cooper and Haltiwanger, 1993).

23

in Sales Management, 4/20/34, pp. 363-404. Data on the level of 1933 sales are provided in
Sales Management, 4/10/35, pp. 418-504. We calculate the level of 1932 sales by applying
the percent change from 1932-33 to the level of 1933 sales.
These data allow us to estimate the effect of many covariates in a way that is not possible
with the 49 observations in a cross-state regression, but the county data also come with
three disadvantages. (1) They are annual rather than monthly, providing only an imperfect
window into the crucial March-July 1933 period. (2) They suffer from some reporting error.
We know this because uniquely for Wisconsin, we have official data on new car registrations
by county to which we can compare the data in Sales Management. Across the 48 Wisconsin
counties for which Sales Management provides data on 1932 sales, the correlation between
the 1932-33 percent change in Sales Management and that in the official data is 0.85. This
is high enough to reassure us that there is a strong signal in the Sales Management data,
but it also indicates substantial reporting error.23 Since the change in auto sales will be our
dependent variable, not our independent variable, this error is more likely to increase our
standard errors than it is to bias our estimates. (3) The third disadvantage of the county
relative to the state data is that it is incomplete. Sales Management provided data on 1932
sales for 2158 counties out of a total of 3100 U.S. counties.24 Fortunately, the data cover
most counties with substantial population and auto sales; they cover 84 percent of 1932 auto
sales.
Figure 9a maps the county auto sales data. Blank areas are those with no data, while
darker areas are those with more rapid auto sales growth. For comparison, figure 9b maps
the change in farm product value across the counties for which we observe auto sales. Farm
product value is calculated as in equation 2, with %∆pricej now equal to

Pj,1933 −Pj,1932 25
.
Pj,1932

The correlation is visually obvious: there was a swath of rapid car sales growth and
large farm product value increases running north from Texas, with pockets of high car sales
23

Official new car registration data for Wisconsin are from “Report of New Car Registrations for the Year
1932” and “Report of New Car Registrations for the Year 1933.” Both are available at the Wisconsin State
Historical Society. In our empirical work, we substitute the official data for the Sales Management data for
Wisconsin.
24
With the addition of the official new registrations data from Wisconsin, we cover 2181 counties.
25
For some crops and counties, we do not observe actual production in 1932. In these cases, we impute
county production of crop j using the formula Qcounty,j,1932 = (Qcounty,j,1929 /Qstate,j,1929 ) × Qstate,j,1932 .
See appendix C.3 for details.

and increasing farm product value through the west. By contrast, in the northeast and
mid-atlantic, car sales and farm product value increased only modestly.
Before reporting county-level regression results, as a benchmark the first two columns of
table 3 show state level results. In column (1), we repeat the specification in column (7) of
table 2. For a direct comparison with the annual county data, in column (2) we rerun this
specification using annual data. The dependent variable is now the growth rate of new auto
sales from 1932 to 1933. The estimate is larger.
Column (3) reports the same specification with county data. We cluster standard errors
at the state level to account for spatial correlation in state-level policies, weather, and other
shocks.26 The magnitude of the coefficient is similar, but the statistical significance is much
higher (t-statistic equal to 2.7). Figure 10 plots a binned scatter plot for this regression. It
shows that new auto sales growth tends to rise with the change in farm product value, and
that this relationship is not driven by outliers. Column (4) adds controls for population,
black population share, democratic vote share in the November 1932 election, rural nonfarm
share, car registrations per capita in 1929, average percent of bank deposits suspended
between 1930 to 1932, and the percent of farms mortgaged as of 1930. Importantly, in
column (4) we also take advantage of the large number of observations to flexibly control for
drought. As mentioned in section 2, drought was one factor pushing up grain prices in 1933.
Insofar as drought conditions in a county were correlated with exposure to farm product
price changes in 1933, this could be a source of bias. To address this, we follow Fishback,
Troesken, Kollmann, Haines, Rhode, and Thomasson (2011) and use data from the National
Climatic Data Center to construct an indicator for whether or not a county suffered from
severe or extreme drought in each month of 1932 and 1933.27 We then interact these 24
26
Clustering at the state level does not correct for spatial correlation across state borders due, for instance,
to weather shocks. Thus, as an alternative, we calculate standard errors following Conley (1999) as implemented by Hsiang (2010). These allow for arbitrary correlation of errors across counties whose centroids
are within a set distance r. When r is greater than 200km, the standard errors from this approach are
very similar to our standard errors clustered at the state level, suggesting that the clustered standard errors
largely absorb spatial correlation.
27
Our drought data differ slightly from those in Fishback et al. (2011) for two reasons: (1) a coding
error made by the National Climatic Data Center which affected historical data downloaded before 2013
(https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/national/2013/3/supplemental/page-7). (2) For counties that span multiple climate divisions, we use GIS to compute the share of the county in each climate division. We then
use these shares to compute a weighted average of the drought measure, rather than a simple average as in
Fishback et al. (2011).

indicator variables with both farm product value and the change in farm product value. In
doing so, the coefficient reported in column (4) on the change in farm product value shows
the effect of a $1 increase in farm product value on auto sales in a county that was not
suffering from extreme drought. In practice, the addition of the drought and other control
variables substantially increases the explanatory power of the regression (as measured by the
R2 ), but only minimally shrinks the coefficient on the change in farm product value.

Notes: The dependent variable is the percent growth of new auto sales in columns (1) through (9) and the change in per capita new auto sales multiplied by 100,000 in column
(10) over the frequency indicated in the table header. County regressions exclude counties with fewer than 500 car registrations in 1929. Control variables are population, the
FDR vote share, the black population share, the rural nonfarm share, car registrations per capita in 1929, deposits suspended from 1929-1932 as a fraction of 1929 deposits, and
the fraction of farms mortgaged in 1930. Drought interactions are based on monthly dummy variables for 1932 and 1933 for whether a county was in a severe or extreme drought,
per the Palmer drought index. These are interacted with both the change in farm product value per capita and farm product value per capita. Standard errors clustered at the

In column (5), we add one further control variable: AAA transfer payments per capita in
1933. In the state data, effects of AAA payments were not a significant concern since monthly
data allowed us to end the estimation in the third quarter of 1933, before substantial AAA
payments had been made.28 But given sizable AAA transfers in late 1933, there is a concern
that these, rather than higher crop prices, could be driving our results. In 1933, AAA rental
and benefit payments were paid only to farmers of cotton, wheat, and tobacco,29 traded crops
whose prices rose rapidly in spring 1933. Thus the regression has difficulty fully disentangling
the effect of these payments from the increase in farm product value. Nonetheless, in column
(5) we still see economically and statistically significant effects of the change in farm product
value.
Our estimate of the AAA payments effect is positive and large, though only marginally
statistically significant. We suspect that the size is in part explained by the fact that our
farm product variables are measured with error, so that the regression attributes part of
the farm channel to the better-measured AAA variable. Still, our finding contrasts with
Fishback, Horrace, and Kantor (2005) and Fishback and Kachanovskaya (2015), who find
small or negative effects of AAA payments on county-level retail sales and state-level income
in the 1930s. The difference in results may be explained by our focus on 1933 alone. Relative
to the entire decade, in 1933 distortions from the AAA may have been less important and
farm debt problems more important.
Columns (6) to (8) add state fixed effects to the specifications of columns (3) to (5). The
resulting coefficients are somewhat smaller but statistically indistinguishable. We believe
state fixed effects to be unnecessary for identification. But the robustness of the results to
their inclusion shows that the farm channel operated within as well as across states.
The results in columns (2) to (8) indicate the importance of traded crops in spring 1933;
96 percent of the variation in the change in farm product value is explained by geographic
variation in traded crop intensity.30 To see this directly, in column (9) we regress auto sales

The Hoover administration used the Federal Farm Board to support grain and cotton markets, but these
programs ended by 1932. See Olmstead and Rhode (2000, p. 732) and references therein.

Smaller amounts of AAA spending went to purchasing hogs and dairy products (United States Department of Agriculture, 1934a, p. 277).

is measured as population

in each category (e.g. cotton, tobacco, and wool). Results show that auto sales grew fastest
in counties with high per capita production of cotton, tobacco, and / or wool. Although
smaller, we also see a significant relationship between the per capita value of grain grown in
a county and auto sales growth in that county. By contrast, there is no relationship between
auto sales growth and the production of hay, potatoes, and fruit or livestock. This fits
with the fact that these were nontraded goods whose prices moved relatively little in 1933
(table 1). The coefficient on milk and egg value per capita is actually negative. This may
reflect the decline in milk and dairy prices in 1933 (table 1), and the likely negative impact
of higher grain prices on the cost of feeding cows and chickens (United States Department
of Agriculture, 1934b, p. 57).
Thus far we have used a specification in which the dependent variable is the percent
change in auto sales. A concern is that a high growth rate of auto sales may be driven
by small counties with small initial levels of auto sales. For this reason, we already drop
counties with fewer than 500 car registrations in 1929. As an additional robustness check,
we specify the dependent variable in specification (1) as the change (not percentage change)
in auto sales from 1932 to 1933 per 100,000 people. Column (10) shows the result. We again
see a positive effect of the change in farm product value. In standard deviation terms, the
magnitude is similar to that in column (3). A one-standard-deviation increase in the change
in farm product value per capita is associated with a 0.43 standard deviation increase in new
auto sales growth and a 0.36 standard deviation increase in the change in new auto sales per
100,000 people.

3.4 Other outcome measures A possible concern is that the behavior of new auto sales in
spring 1933 is unrepresentative. Here we compare the auto sales response to changing farm
product value with the behavior of other measures of consumption and income. Unfortunately, this comparison is limited by the lower frequency and / or more limited geographical

detail of these alternative series.
We start by comparing department store sales to rural and small town sales of general
merchandise (figure 11).31 We consider department store sales to be a rough proxy for
urban consumption, since department stores were located in cities. Both department store
and rural retail sales followed a similar downward path in 1932. Department store sales
then rose 19 percent between March and July 1933, while rural sales of general merchandise
rose 50 percent. The very rapid growth of rural sales was in part driven by a sharp drop
in March that was reversed in April. But the relatively more rapid growth of rural sales
does not depend on this single observation: February to July, department store sales grew
11 percent while rural sales grew 27 percent; April to July, department store sales grew 8
percent while rural sales grew 16 percent. The relatively rapid increase in rural consumption
fits with the argument of this paper that recovery in spring 1933 was in part driven by farm
demand.
Other than auto sales, we have no other monthly state-level consumption indicators. But
31

Rural and small town retail sales are a Department of Commerce index that uses data on mail order and
chain store sales to measure consumption in small towns (population less than 10,000) and on farms. The
underlying data were provided by Chicago Mail Order House, Montgomery Ward & Co., Sears, Roebuck &
Co., and J. C. Penney Co. For further details, see U.S. Department of Commerce (1934b).

Notes: The dependent variable is indicated in the table header. Column 6 excludes counties with fewer than

in table 4 we do analyze annual state-level data on truck sales, electric refrigerator sales,
manufacturing employment, and income. We also look at county-level data on the number
of tax returns filed, a proxy for the income of the top 5-10 percent. Results in columns
(2) and (3) for truck sales and refrigerators are in line with those for auto sales (column
1) in suggesting a large spending response to the change in farm product value. In the
employment and income regressions, coefficients are positive but imprecisely estimated. We
conjecture that this is due to employment and income leakages outside farm areas. When a
farmer in North Dakota bought a car, the car purchase showed up in North Dakota, but the
employment and income response might have shown up in Michigan. Therefore, as a general
indicator of farm income, we prefer the aggregate numbers shown in figure 5. As discussed
in section 2, these numbers show a very large increase in farm income in spring 1933.

4 Mechanisms
In 1933 agricultural areas experienced faster consumption growth and income growth.
But these cross-sectional effects need not imply that the farm channel was expansionary for
the U.S. economy as a whole. Positive effects on farm consumption could have been offset by
32

declines in nonfarm consumption. Insofar as higher farm product prices made farmers richer,
they ought also to have made others poorer. If higher farm prices were passed through to
higher food prices, they made urban workers poorer. If they were not passed through, they
lowered the profits of food manufacturers, wholesalers, or retailers. Whether through poorer
urban workers or lower profits, higher farm income and consumption demand ought to have
been matched by lower urban income and consumption demand. Thus the channel leading
from farm prices to farm income could explain the much larger growth in car sales in farm
areas without explaining any of the nationwide growth in car sales in spring 1933. Sales
could have risen a lot in Iowa and fallen slightly in New York with no net aggregate effect.
In standard international macro models, devaluation is expansionary for the home country
in part because foreign economies switch expenditure towards domestic goods. An extensive
literature focusses on whether leaving the gold standard had beggar-thy-neighbor effects
through such expenditure-switching (see Obstfeld and Rogoff (1996, pp. 626-630) for a
survey). But changes in net exports only made small contributions to U.S. growth in 1933
(-0.11 percentage points) and 1934 (0.33 percentage points) (NIPA table 1.1.2). Thus, the
farm channel is unlikely to have had large effects on aggregate GDP through this mechanism.
In this section we consider three other mechanisms through which higher crop prices
could have been expansionary for the U.S. economy. First, if the increase in farm prices
redistributed income from low to high MPC consumers, it would have been expansionary
in the aggregate. Second, if higher farm incomes supported rural banks, whose problems
were particularly severe, they may have helped the financial system and thus the economy
overall. Finally, higher farm product prices may have raised nationwide consumption by
creating expectations of higher future prices.

4.1 Differential MPCs Perhaps the most obvious way in which the farm channel would
have benefitted the entire economy is if farmers had a higher MPC than the workers and / or
businesses (capitalists) paying higher prices for farm products. To understand the plausibility
of this mechanism, we compare the debt burden—a likely key indicator of MPCs—of farmers,
workers, and capitalists. We then estimate the consumption response to higher farm prices
in high versus low debt areas to obtain direct evidence on how debt burdens affected the
33

MPC out of higher income. Together, this evidence suggests that higher farm prices in spring
1933 transferred income from low to high-MPC agents.
4.1.1 Debt burdens Standard incomplete market models (Bewley, 1986; Aiyagari, 1994)
predict that households in debt have a particularly high MPC out of income shocks. This
occurs because consumers subject to a sequence of temporary negative income shocks (e.g.,
lower crop prices) run up against a borrowing constraint, which prevents them from smoothing consumption. At the borrowing constraint, consumers spend all of any increase in income
in order to move closer to the consumption smoothing solution. Consistent with this logic,
Mian et al. (2013) estimate significantly higher MPCs for indebted households in the Great
Recession. Thus, insofar as the farm channel redistributed from low-debt nonfarmers to
high-debt farmers, it could have increased overall aggregate demand.
Data limitations make a precise comparison of farm and nonfarm household and business
debt burdens difficult, but a comparison of mortgage debts suggests that debt problems
were more severe among farmers. In 1933, agricultural mortgage debt totaled $7.7 billion
(Goldsmith, Lipsey, and Mendelson (1963), table Ia, pp. 80-81). This was 24 percent of
the value of farm structures and land and 270 percent of farm personal income. Nonfarm
residential mortgages totaled $23.1 billion (Snowden, 2006a) in 1933, or 29 percent of the
value of nonfarm residential structures and land (Snowden, 2006d) and 52 percent of nonfarm
personal income.32
Presumably because of the much more unfavorable debt-to-income ratios, foreclosure
problems were far more severe among farmers than among nonfarmers. Between 15 March
1932 and 15 March 1933, foreclosures exceeded voluntary farm sales by a ratio of more
than 2 to 1. There were 38.8 foreclosures per 1000 farms or nearly 100 per 1000 mortgaged
farms.33 No exact comparison exists for nonfarm residential housing. But among all non32

Stauber and Regan (1935), table 12, p. 38 document that between 15 March 1932 and 15 March 1933,
there were 16.6 “voluntary sales or trades” and 38.8 “foreclosure of mortgages, bankruptcy, etc.” per 1000
farms. The foreclosure percentage is approximate, since it uses the 1930 percentage of farms mortgaged (40
percent). Using the 1935 share of farms mortgaged (34 percent) results in a slightly higher ratio of foreclosures
per 1000 mortgaged farms. Data on the total number of farms and the number of farms mortgaged are from
U.S. Department of Commerce (1975) series K162 and K154. For more on farm foreclosures in the interwar
period, see Alston (1983).

farm structures—residential and nonresidential—the foreclosure rate per 1000 mortgaged
structures in 1933 was just 13.3, one-eighth that for farms (Snowden, 2006b).34
As noted above, redistribution towards farmers could come not only from nonfarm households, but also from businesses. It is not obvious what the appropriate metric is for comparing
business debt burdens with household debt burdens. But the available evidence suggests that
the debt problems of nonfarm businesses were mild relative to those afflicting households.
In his treatment of U.S. debt problems Clark (1933, p. 172) writes: “The facts show that
the debt situation in industry, though serious, is not cataclysmic nor is it a mass problem.”
Quantitative support for this view comes from a comparison of business failures with farm
and nonfarm foreclosures. Business failures rose 39 percent between 1929 and 1932; by contrast, over this three-year period, farm foreclosures rose 98 percent, and nonfarm foreclosures
rose 84 percent.35
4.1.2 Debt and the MPC Our county data give us sufficient power to detect whether,
as hypothesized, higher farm debt burdens were associated with higher MPCs and thus a
larger local spending response. In that case, the farm channel ought to have been stronger
in counties with more farm debt. We measure this exposure using the percent of farms
mortgaged in 1930 in a county from the agricultural census (United States Department of
Commerce, 1932).36 We interact the percent of farms mortgaged with the level and change
in farm product value per capita (p.c.). We begin by estimating the linear regression
%∆Auto salesi = β0 + β1 ∆farm product value p.c.i × % farms mortgagedi

(4)

+ β2 farm product value p.c.i × % farms mortgagedi + β3 ∆farm product value p.c.i
+ β4 % farms mortgagedi + β5 farm product value p.c.i + γ 0 Xi + εi .
34
Despite this large difference in foreclosure rates, mortgage delinquency rates were if anything higher in
urban areas (Clark, 1933, p. 20). This points to the difficulty of making precise comparisons of farm and
nonfarm debt burdens.
35
Data on business failures are from Sutch (2006); farm foreclosures per 1000 farms are from Alston (1983),
table 1, p. 888, and the total number of farms are from Olmstead and Rhode (2006a); nonfarm business
failures are from Snowden (2006c).
36
This is the most comprehensive indicator of farm debt available from the Census, since so-called “partowners” only report if they are mortgaged, not the size of their mortgage (United States Department of
Commerce, 1932, p. 3). Where mortgage size is available, it correlates with our farm debt variable. Specifically, the average debt level in 1929 per (reporting) farmer across quintiles of % farms mortgaged was $465,
$875, $1509, $2554, and $3963.

35

The coefficient on the interaction term, β1 , shows how local farm debt conditions affected
the strength of the farm channel.
As a second specification we relax the linear structure in equation (4) and instead group
counties into quintiles based on the value of the farm debt variable. We then interact the
level and change in farm product value per capita with these quintiles,

In this specification, the effect of the farm channel is β1 in the lowest quintile, β1 + γ2 in
the second quintile, β1 + γ3 in the third quintile, and so on. Using quintiles allows us to
assess whether the farm channel becomes monotonically weaker or stronger as local farm
debt rises, without imposing that this relationship is linear. The cost is less precision if the
true relationship is indeed linear.
Panel A of table 5 shows the estimates of the linear interaction (equation (4)) with
the percent of farms mortgaged. Panel B shows the estimates using quintiles of percent of
farms mortgaged and farm leverage (equation (5)). For percent of farms mortgaged, we find a
statistically significant and positive linear interaction coefficient in all specifications. In panel
B, without state fixed effects (columns (1) and (3)), quintiles 2 through 5 exhibit stronger
effects of the farm channel than quintile 1. However, within these quintiles the effect is not
monotonic: quintile 2 shows particularly strong responses. This pattern reflects the following
correlation: farmers in cotton counties tended to be less mortgaged but benefitted from a
bumper crop in 1933. By contrast, farmers in wheat counties tended to more mortgaged but
suffered poor crop yields. This induces a negative correlation between the error term and the
interaction of the percent of farms mortgaged quintiles with changes in farm product value,
leading to the non-monotonic pattern and weakening the estimate of the linear interaction.
Since no principal wheat producing state was also a principal cotton producing state,

Notes: Panel A: % of farms mortgaged is scaled to be in standard deviation units; the coefficient of 0.37 in
column (1) means, for instance, that a 1 standard deviation increase in the % of farms mortgaged increases the
effect on auto sales of the change in farm product value per capita by 0.37. As in equation 4, all regressions
include controls for the interaction of 1932 farm value per capita with percent of farms mortgaged, the
1932-33 change in farm product value per capita, and the percent of farms mortgaged.
Panel B: As in equation 5, all specifications control for the interaction of each farm mortgage quintile with
1932 farm product value per capita, the 1932-33 change in farm product value per capita, the 1932 farm
product value per capita, and a dummy variables for each quintile.
All regressions in panels A and B exclude counties with fewer than 500 1929 car registrations and counties
with fewer than 50% of farms reporting their mortgage status. Control variables and drought indicators are
the same as those in column (5) of table 3. Standard errors clustered at the state level in parentheses. *

state fixed effects will absorb this correlation. Thus, with state fixed effects (columns (2)
and (4)), there is a nearly monotonic increase in the farm channel’s effect as one moves
to higher quintiles of farm debt. The linear interaction estimates consequently become
37

larger and more significant. Overall, the results in table 5 imply an important role for farm
indebtedness in the propagation of the farm channel.
4.2 The Banking System A second mechanism through which the farm channel could
have been expansionary in the aggregate is through the banking sector. Banking problems
were particularly severe in rural areas during the Depression (United States Department of
Agriculture, 1935, p. 26). Higher farm product prices likely reduced default probabilities,
thus improving the prospects of rural banks. As Business Week put it in their first issue after
the United States left the gold standard (4/26/33, cover page), “70-cent wheat makes a lot of
sick banks well again.” 37 Extensive bank correspondent networks transmitted banking panics
during the Depression (Richardson, 2007), and these same networks meant that improving
conditions for rural banks may have helped the financial system overall.
Data limitations restrict us to one indicator of bank health: deposits. Monthly data on
deposits by Federal Reserve district and annual data by county allow us to measure deposit
growth in farm relative to nonfarm areas in spring 1933. To the extent that confidence in
farm area banks improved, we would expect individuals to be more willing to deposit funds.
Conversely, deposit growth itself likely improved bank health in farm areas by lowering the
cost of funds. Thus evidence of relatively more deposit growth in farm areas is likely evidence
of a relative improvement in bank health in farm relative to nonfarm areas.
Figure 12 shows the path of average net demand deposits in Federal Reserve member
banks in the Kansas City, Minneapolis, Dallas, St. Louis, and Atlanta districts relative to
the path of deposits in all other districts.38 Kansas City, Minneapolis, Dallas, St. Louis,
and Atlanta were the five districts with the largest increase in farm product value per capita
in 1933. These five districts are also among the top 6 districts ranked by crops sold per
capita and farm share of the population. We focus on net demand deposits since they
are a better indicator than time deposits of month-to-month fluctuations in rural financial
37

Wheat prices averaged 52 cents per bushel in March 1933, 63 cents per bushel in April, and 73 cents per
bushel in May (NBER macrohistory series m04001a).
38
We compute averages for each group of districts by first indexing seasonally-adjusted deposits in a district to the October 1932-February 1933 average, and then taking the arithmetic average across districts.
According to Wall (1937), p. 3 net demand deposits “included total demand deposits of individuals, corporations, etc., plus the excess, if any, of demand deposits due other banks over items in process of collection
and funds held on deposit with other banks.”

conditions (Wall, 1937, p. 2). Figure 12 shows more rapid deposit growth in those areas
of the country benefiting most from higher farm prices. From February 1932 to July 1933,
the farm district deposit average grew 7.1 percent; that in the remaining districts fell 4.7
percent. Nevertheless, the inference from figure 12 is limited because reserve districts do not
neatly split into farm and nonfarm regions, and because pre-trends are not exactly parallel.
Data on bank deposits at the county level allow for a more precise geographic breakdown, but these are only available as of 31 December of each year. So moving to the county
level comes at the cost of conflating banking developments during the early 1933 banking
crisis with those thereafter. With this caveat, figure 13 shows the binned scatter plot from a
regression of 1932-1933 deposit growth on the 1932-33 change in farm product value, controlling for 1932 farm product value. This plot and our regressions below exclude counties with
fewer than three banks.39 There is a clear positive relationship, with counties experiencing
larger increases in farm value also having higher deposit growth.
Unlike the case of new car sales (figure 10), the relationship between change in farm
39

We exclude counties with two or fewer banks, since in these counties the failure of just one bank leads
to extreme values of deposit growth.

product value and deposit growth is distinctly non-linear. Therefore, we do not impose a
linear structure in our regressions. We instead group counties into quartiles based on their
change in farm product value and initial farm product value,

Table 6 shows results. Column (1) shows that deposit growth increases monotonically along
the change in farm product value quartiles. The magnitudes are economically large. In the
fourth quartile, deposit growth is 31 percentage points larger than in the first quartile. The
estimates become statistically and economically weaker as we add control variables (columns

remain monotonically increasing in the quartiles and are in all cases statistically significant

for at least the fourth quartile. For example, our most stringent specification, column 6,
suggests that the farm channel contributed 9.9 percentage points to relative deposit growth
in the most exposed counties. For comparison, in 1933 nationwide deposit growth was -9.5
percent.
Similar results obtain when we change the number of quantiles or when we use quantiles
for our control variables. Overall, these results indicate that deposit funding for banks in
areas exposed to the farm channel improved relative to deposit funding for other banks. The
increase in deposits may also be indicative of an increase in lending, as loan proceeds were
deposited, and as agents deposited funds in advance of loan repayments.40 But our crosssectional results do not prove that the farm channel helped the banking system nationwide;
perhaps the improvement at banks in farm areas came entirely at the expense of banks
in nonfarm areas. But these results at least make it plausible that a bank health channel
existed: if deposit growth was more valuable where banking crises had been most severe,
then the relative growth of deposits in farm areas was likely positive for the financial system
as a whole.
40

We are indebted to Gary Richardson for making this point to us.

4.3 Inflation expectations Narrative evidence suggests that higher farm product price
could themselves have been expansionary by creating expectations of higher future prices.
For instance, figure 14a shows an ad that appeared in the Warsaw, Indiana newspaper on
3 May 1933. It tells consumers that “Already many items made of leather have advanced,”
but that this store still has “shoes at the old price.” Similarly, figure 14b shows an ad for
Firestone tires that appeared in the Los Angeles Times on 11 May 1933. It announces “Tire
Prices Going Higher” so consumers should “Buy Now!” It explains that “increasing prices of
rubber and cotton are sure to bring higher tire prices.” And figure 14c from the Detroit Free
Press on 14 July 1933 tells consumers to buy “foods priced below replacement costs.”
While a definitive conclusion awaits more systematic work, these advertisements suggest
that higher commodity prices may have caused expected inflation, as retailers facing higher
costs delayed raising final goods prices. Since at least Hamilton (1992), economists have
known that commodity prices provide information on expected inflation. This narrative
evidence points to a stronger hypothesis: in spring 1933 higher commodity prices not only
provide evidence of expected inflation, but perhaps were themselves a source of expected
inflation. This implies an interpretation of expected inflation in 1933 somewhat different
from that in the prior literature (e.g., Jalil and Rua, 2016; Eggertsson, 2008). Whereas the
prior literature emphasizes that Roosevelt’s words and actions were crucial since they signaled a commitment to higher inflation, this narrative evidence suggests a more mechanical
possibility: as the dollar weakened, commodity prices rose. These higher prices were only
gradually passed through to final goods prices, leading consumers to expect higher inflation.

5 Aggregate implications
The previous section considers several mechanisms through which the farm channel may
have been expansionary for the economy as a whole. It gives us no guidance, however, on the
quantitative importance of these mechanisms. This requires assumptions about the structure
of the economy. In this section, we discuss what assumptions we believe to be reasonable
and how these help us to construct a mapping between our cross-sectional estimates and
the farm channel’s aggregate effect. The formal model guiding our discussion is presented in
43

appendix F. It bears emphasis that our conclusions about the aggregate effects of the farm
channel are much more speculative than the cross-sectional results of the prior sections.
In considering how to map our cross-sectional estimates to an estimate of the farm channel’s aggregate effect, we start with a simple – but wrong– extrapolation. We then show how
this extrapolation can be adjusted to be made more accurate. Consider our estimate of β
from table 2, columns (1) and (2), where we regress new car sales growth on the state-level
farm population share. Then a simple extrapolation to the aggregate economy would be to
multiply β by the national farm population share φf ,
%∆Y = β × φf .
The implicit counterfactual is predicted auto sales when the farm share of the population is
zero, %∆Y = β × (φf − 0). This extrapolation is almost surely wrong. We first discuss two
mechanical adjustments and then turn to two more substantive considerations.
5.1 Mechanical adjustments As a first, mechanical, adjustment, we need to account for
the fact that in our cross-sectional regressions we estimate the effect of farm income on
new car sales growth, not local consumption growth. These quantities may differ if car
sales responded to income changes differently than other components of consumption. We
therefore compare extrapolated aggregate car sales growth from our regression to actual
aggregate car sales growth rather than to aggregate consumption growth,
%∆Cars = β × φf .
While the marginal propensity to consume on cars may have been higher than that on other
goods, there is no obvious bias in the ratio

extrapolated car sales growth
.
actual car sales growth

Both the numerator and

denominator are likely higher than they would be if we were measuring total consumption
or output. And car production and car sales exhibited similar, though amplified, movements
relative to industrial production as a whole. Over our sample period from 1932:Q4-1933:Q1
to 1933:Q3, seasonally adjusted car sales rose 86.5 percent, car production 84.1 percent,
and industrial production 41 percent.41 Thus, we take estimates of the fraction of car sales
41

See appendix A for details on the car data sources and seasonal adjustment.

44

growth explained by the farm channel to be rough estimates of the fraction of overall output
growth explained by the farm channel.
We also need to account for the fact that a larger farm share in the cross-section is not
the same as a larger farm share in the aggregate. In our model, the importance of the
farm channel for an area is a function of the farm income share, the ratio of local farm
income to total local income. The higher the farm income share, the greater the fraction
of local income “treated” by higher farm prices and the greater the expected consumption
growth. The farm population measure (and all our other available measures) only captures this exposure imperfectly. Farm income and population share are linked through
the identity Farm income share ≡
relative incomes,

Farm income per farmer
Income per capita

,

× Farm population share. Holding

fixed locally and nationally, if the farm population

share rises one percentage point in a local area, the local farm income share rises by
Farm area farm income per farmer

× 1%. If the farm population share rises by one percentage point

nationally, the national farm income share increases by

× 1%. In

1933, the relative income of farmers was higher in farm areas than it was nationwide

;
National income per capita

therefore, our cross-sectional esti-

mates reflect that a one percentage point change in the local farm population share implies
a larger change to local farm income shares than to the national farm income share.
We can bound this bias because income per farmer was no higher in (poorer) farm areas
than it was nationally,

Farm area farm income per farmer
National farm income per farmer

≤ 1. In other words, while farmers were

richer relative to the general population in farm areas (e.g. the south) than they were
nationally, average farm income per farmer was not in absolute dollar terms higher in farm
areas than it was nationally.43 So we can bound the relative difference in national treatment
intensity with

National income per capita

≤

National income per capita

Thus, we pare back our cross-

sectional coefficient by the ratio of farm area income per capita to income in the country as

This adjustment reduces our estimate of the farm channel’s aggregate effect, since farm areas
of the United States, in particular the South, tended to be poorer than the country as a
whole.

5.2 Redistribution and Pass-Through A more substantive issue is that farmers’ gains
came at the expense of nonfarmers. In section 4, we argued that farmers’ large debt burdens indicate a high MPC. Thus, redistribution to farmers would have been expansionary if
farmers received income from low MPC consumers or firms. The strength of this effect was
determined by the relative MPCs of farmers and nonfarmers. If higher farm prices transferred income from consumers with a low MPC, then aggregate output would have increased
substantially. This could have occurred, for instance, if the cost of higher farm prices was
largely borne by businesses with low debt burdens and low MPCs. (In the following discussion and in the model of appendix F, we assume that firms (capitalists) are permanent
income consumers with a MPC of 0.) By contrast, if the cost of higher farm prices primarily
fell on nonfarm workers with a high MPC, then redistribution would not have raised the
aggregate MPC and aggregate output.
A high, positive β is a necessary, though not a sufficient, condition for a large aggregate
effect of the farm channel. It is necessary, because if β is small then the income transfer to
farmers was small and / or farmers’ MPC out of the transfer was small. In either case, the
aggregate effect would have been small. A high β is not sufficient for large aggregate effects,
since β can be large because farmers had a high MPC or because losses from higher farm
prices were borne by high-MPC consumers in the nonfarm area. Both cases would result
in substantial cross-sectional consumption differences, but only in the first case would the
aggregate output effect be large.
We suspect that the most important channel through which losses accrued to high-MPC
consumers in the nonfarm area was via pass-through from higher farm prices to urban food
prices. We embed this effect in our model in appendix F, which suggests that we apply the
46

θf is the fraction of borrowing-constrained (high-MPC) farmers, θw is the fraction of borrowingconstrained (high-MPC) consumers (workers), and ξ is the share of losses from higher farm
product prices borne by workers. Thus, our estimate of the aggregate effect shrinks when
more losses are borne by workers (ξ is high), and when they have a relatively high MPC
w

compared to farmers ( θθf is high). ξ depends on how higher farm product prices affected real
wages, i.e., (1) how higher farm prices changed workers’ nominal wages, and (2) how higher
farm prices affected final goods prices. We suspect that (1) is positive; insofar as higher
farm prices were expansionary, they likely put upward pressure on nominal wages. Indeed,
over our sample period from the 1932:Q4-1933:Q1 average to 1933:Q3, nominal wages in the
manufacturing sector increased by 7.2 percent.44 Unfortunately, quantifying the contribution
of higher farm prices to this increase is difficult, since we do not observe the counterfactual
behavior of wages.
Precise conclusions about the degree of pass-through are also difficult. But the available
data paint a picture of incomplete retail price adjustment. From the 1932:Q4-1933:Q1 average to 1933:Q3, the CPI rose a modest 1.5 percent. It was completely flat between March
and May 1933. The BLS index of the price of food in urban areas first declined 1.1 percent
from 1932:Q4-1933:Q1 to 1933:Q2 and then rose 14.6 percent in 1933:Q3.45
These aggregates mask substantial heterogeneity. Some items have sticky prices and
limited pass-through in the initial months after devaluation. For instance, between March
and July 1933, the price of cornflakes was unchanged at 8.1 cents per 8-oz package despite
a doubling of the cost of the corn input from 0.25 cents to 0.68 cents.46 This sort of incomplete pass-through is also visible in the advertisements we discussed in section 4, warning
consumers of coming price increases. In other cases, there were rapid increases in food prices.

For instance, the price of flour rose 54 percent from 1932:Q4-1933:Q1 to 1933:Q3 (United
States Department of Labor, 1938, table 7, pp. 78-79). It is difficult to know to what extent
higher retail food prices were caused by pass-through of higher farm product prices versus
by other factors. Some food (like flour) was itself traded meaning that devaluation may have
put direct upward pressure on prices independent of pass-through from farm products. And
the National Industrial Recovery Act (signed into law on 16 June 1933), a new processing
tax, rising wages, and increased product demand likely also contributed to higher prices. We
can be fairly confident that higher farm product costs were not the only driver of higher food
prices, since some food prices rose by much more than the change in the farm input cost.
From 1932:Q4-1933:Q1 to 1933:Q3, for instance, the retail price of chicken rose one cent per
pound, while the farm-gate price rose 0.3 cents.47
Food production was not the only sector affected by higher farm prices. Most obviously,
cotton was used in textile production and tobacco in cigarette production. Even heavy
industry used farm products. For instance, a small car contained roughly 90 pounds of
cotton (Ward’s Reports Inc., 1938). Unfortunately, we lack the monthly data needed to
examine pass-through for these non-food goods. We suspect that given higher levels of
processing, pass-through was if anything lower than in the food sector. We know that the
prices of popular clothing items and tobacco fell or were flat between December 1932 and
June 1933.48 And car prices were essentially unchanged between February 1933 and January
1934.49
Taken together, we believe the evidence suggests that pass-through was incomplete. And
47
These figures are from United States Department of Agriculture (1945), table 28, p. 128. This is the
change in the farm price of 1.136 pounds of chicken, since United States Department of Agriculture (1945),
pp. 117-118 finds that 1.136 pounds of chicken from the farm was needed to produce 1 pound of chicken for
retail sale.
48
United States Department of Labor (1936a) (table 7, p. 1052) provides data on the prices of men’s shirts,
pajamas, and overalls, and women’s housedresses and nightgowns. All these prices fell between December
1932 and June 1933, except for the price of men’s pajamas, which rose from $1.63 to $1.65. United States
Department of Labor (1936b) (table 13, p. 241) provides data on the retail price of cigarettes, cigars,
cigarette tobacco, pipe tobacco, and plug tobacco. These prices all declined between December 1932 and
June 1933. Unfortunately, these retail price data for textiles and tobacco are only available at 6-month
intervals (June and December). So we do not know what happened to these prices in the third quarter of
1933.
49
This refers to the BLS index of wholesale car prices, NBER macrohistory series m04180b. The constancy
of car prices over this period likely reflects the industry pattern of changing car prices only when new models
were introduced, which occurred in January (Cooper and Haltiwanger, 1993; Hausman, 2016b).

48

higher nominal wages mean that the degree of pass-through may itself be an overestimate of
the losses borne by high-MPC urban workers. Since the precise incidence of redistribution
is difficult to discern from the available data, in our quantification below we consider a wide
range of possible values.

5.3 General Equilibrium The cross-sectional coefficient β does not capture aggregate
general equilibrium effects. These are differenced out in the cross-section because they affected farm and nonfarm areas equally. We believe that general equilibrium effects operating
in spring 1933 likely amplified the impact of the farm channel. This view aligns with Nakamura and Steinsson (2014) and Chodorow-Reich (2017) who argue that offsetting general
equilibrium forces are limited at the zero lower bound.
Our cross-sectional regressions do not measure the possible effects of monetary policy
and expected inflation. The aggregate effect could be small and the cross-sectional effect
large if the Federal Reserve had raised nominal interest rates in response to devaluation
and rapid output growth. But short-term interest rates were at the zero lower bound in
spring 1933, and long-term rates were flat or slightly falling. That interest rates did not rise
meant that any increase in expected inflation due to higher farm prices would have lowered
expected real interest rates. And intertemporal substitution would have then led to higher
aggregate consumption and output. This is a positive general equilibrium effect that our
cross-sectional results miss. In section 4, we provided qualitative evidence for this effect.
Our cross-sectional estimates also do not capture the fact that spending by a farmer on
goods produced outside her state / county benefited the entire U.S. economy. When a farmer
bought a car, this increased income and consumption in manufacturing areas (e.g. Michigan), reducing the cross-sectional consumption differences across U.S. states and counties.
This difference between the cross-sectional and aggregate effect is captured in the aggregate
spending multiplier.
A final aggregate effect not measured by the cross-sectional regressions is that of bank
health. As discussed in the previous section, by redistributing deposits towards troubled
banks, the farm channel could have been expansionary for the economy as a whole. But
our cross-sectional estimates only pick up the improvement in farm areas relative to that in
49

nonfarm areas.
5.4 Quantifying the aggregate effect Putting together the factors discussed in this section, our model implies an expanded version of equation (7),

Intertemporal Substitution

The first line combines all elements of the redistribution effect. The second line does the
same for the intertemporal substitution effect, in other words the positive effect on output
of higher inflation expectations and resulting lower real interest rates. d ln(1 + rt ) is the
change in the real interest rate due to the farm channel, and σ is the intertemporal elasticity
of substitution. Our model omits any effect of the farm channel on bank health, so any such
effect is absent from equation 8.
We quantify the overall effect as follows. The nationwide farm population share in 1930
was φf = 24.8% (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1933, table 2, p. 8). We set the ratio of
per-capita income in farm areas relative to nationwide per capita income to be

Yp.c.,a
Yp.c.

= 0.63.

Per-capita income in farm states is that in states with farm population share greater than or
equal to the national average.50 Seventy-seven percent of the farm population lived in these
states.
We consider a range of values from the literature for the aggregate multiplier. Gordon
and Krenn (2014) (p. 24) estimate an aggregate multiplier of 3.1-3.3 in 1940-41, before
supply constraints were binding. Using international data, Almunia, Benetrix, Eichengreen,
O’Rourke, and Rua (2010) estimate a multiplier in the 1930s of 2.5. And Hausman (2016a)
estimates an MPC ranging from 0.6 to 0.75 among veterans in 1936, consistent with a
multiplier (µ =

1
)
1−M P C

of 2.5 or larger. In contrast, Ramey and Zubairy (2018) generally

estimate multipliers below one, though at the zero lower bound and without rationing, they
find a multiplier of roughly 1.5. We therefore consider multipliers ranging from 1 to 3.

The amount of redistribution from high-MPC consumers (ξ θθf ) to farmers is likely the
most uncertain element in the first line of equation 8. There was certainly some pass-through
from farm prices to urban food prices, so ξ > 0. And some workers did have high MPCs,
θw > 0. On the other hand, we noted cases in which pass-through appears to have been close
to zero, and we argued that farmers likely had more severe debt problems and associated
higher MPCs than nonfarmers, implying

θw
θf

< 1. These considerations suggest a range of

the correction factor of 0.3 to 0.7.51
Unfortunately, the size of the intertemporal substitution channel and the bank health
channel are too uncertain to quantify given the available information. Since these channels
added to the farm channel’s aggregate effect, ignoring them makes our estimates a lower
bound.
Columns 2 through 4 of table 7 show predicted growth rates for aggregate car sales
from equation (8) for given combinations of the multiplier and redistribution from highMPC consumers. These range from 8 percent for the smallest value of the multiplier and
the largest redistribution correction factor to 56 percent for the highest multiplier and the
lowest redistribution correction factor. Columns 5 through 7 express this predicted growth
rate as a fraction of actual aggregate new car sales growth, which was 86.5 percent between
the 1932:Q4-1933:Q1 average and 1933:Q3.52
While table 7 displays a range of outcomes, it shows that the farm channel makes a
The correction factor would be 0.3 if pass-through (ξ) were 0.4, the share of constrained workers (θw )
were 0.6, and the share of constrained farmers (θf ) were 0.8. The correction factor would be 0.7 if passthrough (ξ) were 0.8, the share of constrained workers (θw ) were 0.7, and the share of constrained farmers
(θf ) were 0.8.

negligible contribution to aggregate car sales only if all of the following three conditions
hold: first, losses from higher farm product prices fall primarily on consumers with MPCs
nearly as high as those of farmers. Second, the aggregate multiplier is around 1 or lower at
the trough of the Great Depression. Third, any inflation expectations or bank health effects,
which are not included in the table’s figures, are negligible. In our view, it is unlikely that all
three of these conditions were met. If one excludes such combinations—the top left corner of
table 7—one obtains a range of 20-60 percent for the proportion of actual car sales growth
explained by the farm channel.

6 Conclusion
This paper provides evidence on the sources of U.S. recovery in spring 1933. We document the importance of the farm channel: devaluation raised prices of traded crops and
close substitutes, raising income and consumption in agricultural areas. We estimate the
importance of the farm channel for recovery using state and county auto sales data. Our
estimates imply that a one-standard-deviation increase in the share of a state’s population
living on farms was associated with a 25-30 percentage point increase in auto sales growth
between the October 1932 - March 1933 average and the July - September 1933 average.
These cross-sectional effects explain a substantial fraction of cross-state variation in auto
sales growth and are concentrated in areas growing traded crops or close substitutes. The
additional statistical power of the county data reveals that the spending effects from a given
increase in farm product value were larger in counties with more farm debt.
Together with evidence that farmers were among the most indebted agents in the economy, this suggests that higher crop prices could have been expansionary for the U.S. economy
as a whole by redistributing income to indebted, high-MPC farmers. We argue that redistribution to farmers significantly increased economy-wide spending, because pass-through of
higher farm product prices to final goods prices was incomplete, and business debt burdens
and MPCs were likely relatively low. Coupled with a plausible aggregate multiplier, and
evidence of positive effects of higher farm prices on bank health and inflation expectations,
we conclude that the farm channel explains a substantial share, in the range of 20-60 percent,
52

of spring 1933 growth.
To the extent that the farm channel contributed to overall recovery in the United States,
the lessons of 1933 for macroeconomic policy are more nuanced than often assumed. In particular, our work points to the importance of redistribution as a channel for macroeconomic
policy. Japan’s recent efforts to raise inflation expectations and end two decades of output
stagnation (so-called “Abenomics”) provide an illustrative example. When Japan embarked
on Abenomics, the U.S. success in 1933 was invoked to predict success in Japan (Romer,
2014; Kuroda, 2013). Just like the United States in 1933, Japan in 2013-14 weakened its
currency and raised inflation expectations. But whereas devaluation in 1933 redistributed
income to indebted farmers with a high MPC, the weakening of the yen may have redistributed income from workers to large, exporting businesses with a low marginal propensity
to spend.53 Thus an appreciation of the farm channel may help economists understand why
Abenomics failed to quickly produce rapid growth.

A Checking data consistency in spring 1933
Rapid growth rates over a short period naturally lead to questions of data quality: should
one believe that seasonally adjusted industrial production rose 57 percent in spring 1933 or
might this reported increase be a result of data construction problems? We argue the former.
Since our conclusion is in line with Taylor and Neumann (2016), our analysis in this appendix
is brief.
The first check is to consider the behavior of non-seasonally adjusted production. This is
shown in figure A.1a. The rapid increase in industrial production is also present in the raw,
non-seasonally adjusted data and is not a regular seasonal phenomena. Only in 1933 does
one see such a dramatic increase in spring. A second check on data quality is to see whether
the rapid production increase is driven by outliers. It appears not. Of the 19 individual
industry production series comprising durable manufacturing published in Federal Reserve
(1940), eight saw seasonally adjusted production rise more than 100 percent between March
and July 1933; all but one (railroad car production) of the 19 saw production rise more than
20 percent.
A.1 Other production indicators A further check on the industrial production data is to
consider alternative indicators of economic activity. Figure A.1b shows two such indicators:
the Federal Reserve index of freight car loadings and nonagricultural employment (Federal
Reserve, 1941). Freight car loadings measure the real quantity of shipments by rail, with
underlying data from the railroads themselves. The broad picture is similar to that for
industrial production. After reaching a trough in March 1933, seasonally adjusted freight
car loadings grew rapidly through July. In these four months, the seasonally adjusted series
rose 40 percent.
It is also natural to examine the evolution of employment. Caution is necessary since the
employment data are not entirely independent of the industrial production data. For some
industries, the industrial production figures rely heavily on the Bureau of Labor Statistics
establishment survey, which is the employment data’s source (Federal Reserve, 1940, p. 761).
Nonetheless, it is reassuring that, like industrial production, employment rose rapidly in
spring 1933. Total, seasonally adjusted, nonagricultural employment grew from 26.7 million
in March 1933 to 28.4 million in July.54 Seventy-three percent of this employment increase
was accounted for by an astonishing 20 percent increase in manufacturing employment.55
A.2 Sales Together, the data on industrial production, employment, and freight car loadings leave little doubt that output rose rapidly in spring 1933. But was the recovery of
production due to contemporaneous consumer demand or to expectations of future demand?
If the former, the historians’ task is to explain the increase in consumption. If the latter, to
explain why firms expected higher future sales. Therefore we examine the behavior of sales
in spring 1933. Figure A.1c shows seasonally adjusted passenger car sales and production
54

Note that these employment data exclude relief workers. Data are from Federal Reserve (1941) p. 534.
Manufacturing employment rose from 6.12 million in March to 7.36 million in July (Federal Reserve,
1941, p. 534).

Figure A.1 – Notes: See text for details on the seasonal adjustment of car and truck sales / production.
Sources: Industrial production: Federal Reserve Board, G.17 data release. Freight car loadings and employment: Federal Reserve (1941). Cars: Sales data are from NBER macrohistory series m01109; production
data are from NBER series m01107a. Trucks: Sales data are from NBER macrohistory series m01146a;
production data are from NBER series m01144a.

61

from 1931 through 1934.56 Seasonally adjusted sales behave similarly to production in spring
1933, roughly doubling from March to July. Figure A.1d presents the analogous data for
trucks. Interestingly, the recovery of truck sales is even more rapid than that of car sales in
spring 1933: they rise 202 percent from March to July.57
As with cars, the difference between truck production and sales is not obviously anomalous in spring 1933. Figures A.1c and A.1d suggest a roughly parallel movement in production
and sales of cars and trucks. This mirrors the finding of Taylor and Neumann (2016) that
manufacturing inventories behaved normally in spring 1933.

B Appendix Tables

56

Sales data are from NBER macrohistory series m01109; production data are from NBER series m01107a.
Neither series was seasonally adjusted by the source. We seasonally adjust the series by regressing the natural
logarithm of each series on monthly dummies for the period January 1929-December 1934, excluding 1933.
We use this narrow sample to align with the seasonal adjustment procedure used for the monthly state auto
sales. The series graphed in figure A.1c is eεˆt × x̄ȳ , where εˆt are the residuals from the regression of the
natural log of sales or production on the monthly dummies, ȳ is the mean of non-seasonally adjusted sales
over the period, and x̄ is the mean of eεˆt .
57
Sales data are from NBER macrohistory series m01146a; production data are from NBER series m01144a.
The seasonal adjustment procedure is identical to that for passenger cars. See footnote above.

United States Department of Agriculture (1936) table 331, p. 229. Trade quantities
are for the calendar year. The trade data are for hog products; thus they are an upper
bound on trade in pork itself.
• Milk: Monthly U.S. producer prices are from United States Department of Agriculture

as for auto sales (footnote 14). The seasonal adjustment is done on data from January 1926 through December 1935, excluding 1933. Farm product value is production
multiplied by the weighted-average calendar year producer price (United States Department of Agriculture (1936), table 376, p. 267). These USDA publications provide
no trade data, presumably because little milk was traded. (There was trade in some
milk by-products, such as condensed and evaporated milk.)
• Chickens: Monthly U.S. producer prices are from United States Department of Agriculture (1936), table 410, p. 286. We seasonally adjust these prices using the same
procedure as for auto sales (footnote 14). The seasonal adjustment is done on data from
January 1926 through December 1935, excluding 1933. Production and farm product
66

value data refer to the number of chickens raised; data are from United States Department of Agriculture (1936), table 403, p. 281. United States Department of Agriculture
(1936) provides no trade data, presumably because little chicken was traded.
• Eggs: Monthly U.S. producer prices are from United States Department of Agriculture
(1936), table 419, p. 291. We seasonally adjust these prices using the same procedure
as for auto sales (footnote 14). The seasonal adjustment is done on data from January
1926 through December 1935, excluding 1933. Production and farm product value data
are from United States Department of Agriculture (1936), table 403, p. 281. Trade
data are from United States Department of Agriculture (1936), table 423, p. 293. They
are for the period July 1932 to June 1933 and are reported in dollar terms; therefore,
we calculate the trade output share as imports plus exports (in dollars) divided by
total farm value (in dollars).
C.2 Farm product value for U.S. states Except as noted below, we compute the price
for 1932 production using a weighted average of monthly, non-seasonally adjusted prices.
We compute the percent change in prices from the October 1932 - March 1933 average to
the July-September 1933 average using seasonally adjusted, unweighted monthly prices.
• Wheat: Raw and seasonally adjusted monthly price data are the same as listed in
section C.1. To compute annual 1932 and 1933 prices, we weight the monthly prices
using monthly wheat receipts, United States Department of Agriculture (1936), table
11, p. 15. Production data for 1932 by state are from United States Department
of Agriculture (1934b), table 4, p. 389. For the states Colorado, Illinois, Indiana,
Kansas, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota,
Virginia, and Wyoming we use 1932 production data from the National Agricultural
Statistics Service (NASS).58 For Illinois, we take data on winter wheat only from NASS
and add to it the data on spring wheat production reported in Illinois Cooperative Crop
Reporting Service (1951).
• Corn: Raw and seasonally adjusted monthly price data are the same as listed in section
C.1. To compute annual 1932 and 1933 prices, we weight the monthly prices using
monthly marketings by farmers, United States Department of Agriculture (1935), table
48, p. 385. Production data for 1932 by state are from United States Department of
Agriculture (1934b), table 41, p. 415. For the states Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa,
Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, and Wisconsin we use
1932 production data from NASS.
• Oats: Raw and seasonally adjusted monthly price data are the same as listed in section
C.1. To compute annual 1932 and 1933 prices, we weight the monthly prices using
monthly marketings by farmers, United States Department of Agriculture (1935), table

monthly marketings by farmers, United States Department of Agriculture (1935), table
117, p. 429. Production data for 1932 by state are from United States Department of
Agriculture (1934b), table 112, p. 460. For the states California, Georgia, Mississippi,
and North Carolina we use 1932 production data from NASS.
• Tobacco: No monthly prices are available over a long enough time horizon to make
seasonal adjustment possible; thus we use the calendar year, annual price reported in
Strauss and Bean (1940), p. 69, table 27. Production data for 1932 by state are from
United States Department of Agriculture (1934b), table 155, p. 486.
• Hay: Raw and seasonally adjusted monthly price data are the same as listed in section
C.1. No monthly weights are available, so the annual price is a simple average of the
monthly prices. Production data for 1932 by state are from United States Department
of Agriculture (1934b), table 287, p. 564, for tame hay and from United States Department of Agriculture (1934b), table 288, p. 565, for wild hay. For the states Illinois,
Minnesota, Missouri, North Dakota, and South Dakota we use 1932 production data
from NASS.
• Potatoes: Raw and seasonally adjusted monthly price data are the same as listed in
section C.1. To compute annual 1932 and 1933 prices, we weight the monthly prices
using monthly potato shipments, United States Department of Agriculture (1936), table 227, p. 161. Production data for 1932 by state are from United States Department

• Chickens: Monthly and weighted-average calendar year producer prices are taken from
United States Department of Agriculture (1936), table 410, p. 286. Seasonal adjustment is as described in section C.1. Production data for 1932 by state are from Pirtle
and Slocum (1937), table 18, p. 16, for chickens sold and table 19, p. 17, for chickens

consumed on farms. To match production data on number of chickens to price data
on the value of a pound of chicken, we assume that each chicken weighs 3.7 pounds.
We obtain this number by taking the ratio of the figures on price per chicken and price
per pound of chicken reported in United States Department of Agriculture (1935).

• Apples: Monthly producer prices are from United States Department of Agriculture
(1936), table 155, p. 116. Seasonal adjustment follows the procedure used for auto
sales (footnote 14). The seasonal adjustment is done on data from June 1926 through
December 1935, excluding 1933. Weights for annual prices are based on monthly car
lot shipments, United States Department of Agriculture (1936), table 158, p. 118.
Production data for 1932 by state are from United States Department of Agriculture

C.3 Farm product value for U.S. counties Since we use national prices, all prices are
identical to those described above for the state data. County-level production data are
constructed as follows:
• Wheat: we calculate the county’s share in 1929 state wheat production from the 1930
agricultural census (Haines et al., 2015). We then multiply 1932 state production by
that share to impute 1932 county production. For the states Colorado, Illinois, Indiana,
Kansas, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota,
Virginia, and Wyoming we use county-level 1932 production data from NASS. For
Illinois, we take data on winter wheat only from NASS and add to it the data on spring
wheat production reported in Illinois Cooperative Crop Reporting Service (1951).
69

• Corn: we calculate the county’s share in 1929 state corn production from the 1930

that share to impute 1932 county production.

D Monthly state auto sales data
Our monthly state auto sales data come from the Automotive Daily News Review and
Reference Book 1935, pp. 22-23. The source is given as “R. L. Polk & Co., New Jersey
Motor List Co. and Sherlock & Arnold.”
To check the accuracy of these data, we computed annual totals by state for 1932 and
1933 and compared these to the numbers reported in Automotive Industries, 2/25/33, p.
224 (for 1932) and 2/24/34, p. 220 (for 1933).
In 52 of 98 cases, these sources exactly agree, and in all but two cases, the two sources are
within 0.2 percent of each other. The two larger discrepancies are in Indiana in 1932, where
Automotive Industries records 29,202 cars sold while Automotive Daily News Review and
Reference Book records 28,505 cars sold, and in Iowa in 1932 where Automotive Industries
records 18,971 cars sold and Automotive Daily News Review and Reference Book records
19,525 cars sold.
When these sources differ, it may be due to misreporting / typos in the monthly data.
In a few cases, these typos were obvious, and we fixed them by using reported totals to
compute a residual. Automotive Daily News Review and Reference Book always reported
the total by month and state for the years 1929-1934, e.g. they reported the sum of sales in
Alabama for January 1929 + January 1930 . . . + January 1934. This allows us to fill in
months in which there is an obvious typo. Specifically:
• January 1932, Indiana: Automotive Daily News Review and Reference Book reports car
sales equal to 5180. As reported, this means car sales for the six Januarys from 1929
to 1934 total to 25,260, much more than the reported total of 22,563. Furthermore,
the 5180 figure for January 1932 is suspect because it is larger than Indiana sales in
January 1930, 1931, 1933, or 1934, and it is larger than Illinois sales in January 1932.
71

Thus we replace it with the difference between the reported six-January total (22,563)
and the sum of the reported figures for all Januarys except January 1932. The resulting
number is 2,483 cars sold.
• July 1932, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, and Missouri: In these states, the reported figure for July
1932 sales is identical to that for July 1933 sales. Since on average summer 1932
sales were below summer 1933 sales, we replace the July 1932 figure with the reported
six-July sum and sales in all Julys except July 1932. In all cases, this results–as
expected–in a number that is less than the July 1933 number.
• February 1929, Nebraska: Automotive Daily News Review and Reference Book reports
470 cars sold in Nebraska in February 1929. This is implausibly low (e.g. 3986 cars
were sold in Nebraska in the more depressed conditions of February 1930). So we
replace it with the difference between the 6-February sum and the sum of all February
sales except February 1929. The resulting number is a more plausible 4705 cars sold.

E Banking data: Net demand deposits by reserve district
We seasonally adjust the series using the procedure defined in footnote 14, excluding the
year 1933. Data begin in April 1923 and end in July 1935, when there is a discontinuity in
the series (Federal Reserve, 1935, p. 644).

Capitalists sell the final good at a mark-up mt ≥ 1 over marginal costs, so the final retail

Farm goods Ft and labor Lt are in perfectly elastic supply at zero marginal cost up to
a full-employment limit F̄ and L̄. We will consider the case where Ft < F̄ and Lt < L̄ to
capture underutilization of the factors of production during the Great Depression.
The income share of farmers is then,

where we use the fact that Ct = Yt in equilibrium, and pft is the real farm product price, Ptt .
Since farm goods and labor are complements, the farm income share is increasing in the real
farm price. Thus, a higher real farm price redistributes income towards farmers.
The income share of capitalists comes from charging a mark-up over marginal cost,

Thus, when the farm share increases, the losses are split between workers and capitalists
depending on the response of the mark-up. When the mark-up remains constant (i.e., firms
raise their price sufficiently), then all losses are borne by workers. By contrast, when real
wages are unchanged (e.g., final goods prices and wages are sticky), then the mark-up falls
and all losses are borne by capitalists.

F.2 Aggregate demand
Any farmer, worker, or capitalist may be either unconstrained (u) or constrained (c) in
their consumption choices. We directly parameterize consumption functions for these types,
Ctu = [β(1 + rt )]−σ C̄ u
Ctc = Ytc .
Ctx is consumption and Ytx is income of type x, β is the discount factor, rt is the real interest
rate, and σ is the intertemporal elasticity of substitution. Unconstrained consumers follow
the permanent income hypothesis, where the quantity C̄ u is their permanent income. They
may consume more than their permanent income when the real interest rate is low and viceversa. In writing the Euler equation in this way, we assume perfect foresight as in Werning
(2011) and Wieland (2017) and let the horizon over which the real interest rate applies be
relatively long.59
By contrast, constrained consumers are at their borrowing constraint and consume all
their income. We think of farmers as being primarily in the constrained group, although we
allow for some of them to be unconstrained as well.
Specifically, we assume that a fraction θf of farmers and fraction θw of workers are
constrained. In line with our evidence that debt problems were less severe for firms than for
workers or households, we assume that no capitalist is constrained. Then the constrained
income share is

Qs
More precisely, we can write the perfect-foresight Euler equation as Ct = [β̃ s k=1 (1 + rt+k )]−σ Ct+s .
We then let s be sufficiently large such that Ct+s ≈ C̄ u , assuming (as in most
Qsmonetary models) that the
economy converges to a single deterministic steady-state. Then define rt = k=1 (1 + rt+k )]−1 as the real
interest rate from t to t + s and β = β̃ s as the corresponding discount factor.

Figure F.1 – Keynesian cross diagram. Redistribution towards constrained consumers increases the average MPC in the economy from mpc to mpc0 , and increases output from Yt
to Yt0 .
Market clearing implies that output equals expenditure, Yt = Ct = Ctu +Ctc . Substituting
our consumption functions yields a solution for output akin to a Keynesian cross,
Yt = [β(1 + rt )]−σ C̄ u + sct Yt
where [β(1 + rt )]−σ C̄ u is autonomous consumption and sct is the MPC. The aggregate MPC
out of income is the share of constrained consumers, since they have an MPC of 1, whereas
unconstrained consumers have an MPC of zero. Thus mpct = sct × 1 + sut × 0 = sct .
1
Define the aggregate multiplier as µt = 1−mpc
. Then the solution for aggregate output
t
is
Yt = µt [β(1 + rt )]−σ C̄ u .
Thus, any change in aggregate output must come from a change in the multiplier µt or in
the real interest rate. Redistribution of income directly affects aggregate output through
the aggregate multiplier. For example, increasing the share of income going to constrained
consumers will raise sct and thus the multiplier µt , which in turn raises output. Graphically,
the expenditure curve in the Keynesian cross rotates up as shown in figure F.1. Our analysis
of the farm channel will focus on this mechanism.

F.3 Aggregate effect
Our experiment is an unanticipated change in the nominal farm price Ptf . This requires
some control by the policy maker over Ptf . In an international framework we could appeal to
the law of one price, so that the local farm price is the product of the foreign farm price and
75

the exchange rate, Ptf = Ptf ∗ Et . Then a devaluation would raise the local farm price holding
the foreign farm price fixed. In our model the farm price is instead exogenous since any price
Ptf clears the farm product market when there is underemployment, Ft << F̄ .60 This helps
us simplify the model and more transparently focus on the effects of redistribution.
For now, it will be more convenient to work with the implied change in the farm income
share d ln sft . We can then later express that change in terms of the percent change in farm
prices d ln Ptf .
The percent change in output from a percent change in the farm income share combines
the effect on the aggregate multiplier (through redistribution) and the real interest rate,

Intertemporal Substitution

In this model, a higher farm income share raises output to the extent that it redistributes
income towards constrained consumers (lowering the unconstrained share sut ) and / or lowers
the real interest rate.
The extent to which a higher farm income share redistributes towards high-MPC consumers depends on (1) the importance of constrained farmers and (2) the response of the
mark-up mt to higher farm product prices, since higher prices hurt constrained workers,

For what follows we parameterize the change in mark-ups by,
d ln mt = −(1 − ξ)mt sft d ln sft
where ξ = 0 implies that the mark-up fully absorbs the increase in the farm share, whereas
ξ = 1 implies that the mark-up is unchanged.

where the redistribution term consists of the gains to constrained farmers (θf ) net of the
losses to constrained workers (−θw ξ). For redistribution to be expansionary for the economy
as a whole, the former must exceed the latter, θf > θw ξ.
We assume that Ptf never rises so high that marginal cost exceeds price for final goods producers; this
guarantees that output remains demand-determined as farm product prices increase.

F.4 Cross-section
We are interested in recovering information about the aggregate output effect from our
cross-sectional estimates. To construct a mapping between the aggregate and the cross
section we split the economy into two areas, agriculture a and manufacturing m. Local
income Ya,t accruing to the agricultural area is,
Ya,t ≡ sa,t Yt
where sa,t is the share of national income accruing to the local area.
We assume that the agricultural area is populated by the farmers, a fraction ζ of capitalists, and a fraction η of workers. The share of income accruing to the agricultural area is
then,
sa,t = sft + ζscap

Note that the agricultural area will in general benefit from a higher farm income share
relative to the manufacturing area. This is because some part of the higher farm income
share is paid for by a lower income share of individuals living in the manufacturing area
(either workers or capitalists).
We next need to characterize the local unconstrained and constrained income shares.
We assume that for workers the probability of being constrained is the same in both areas,

θw = θaw = θm
. Adding the restrictions that income shares have to sum to 1 yields the
income shares of locally unconstrained and constrained consumers,

Ca,t = Ca,t
+ Ca,t

= [β(1 + rt )]−1 C̄au + mpca,t sa,t Yt
Analogous to aggregate consumption, the first term is a permanent income component coming from unconstrained consumers, [β(1 + rt )]−1 C̄ u . The second term again captures variable expenditure, which is a function of local income sa,t Yt and the local MPC, mpca,t =
sua,t ×0+sca,t ×1 = sca,t = 1−sua,t . As is the case nationally, the local MPC is solely determined
by the importance of constrained consumers.
In our regressions we compare the growth rate of consumption across areas conditional
on a change in farm product prices. Thus, we need to characterize how local consumption
in each area responds to a change in farm prices. In the model any change in consumption
can be decomposed into the following terms,

Intertemporal Substitution
Unconstrained consumption share

where the first line is the consumption response by constrained consumers, and the second line is the consumption response by unconstrained consumers. Thus, these effects are
weighted by their respective consumption share.
Starting with the constrained consumers, the first term in brackets captures the withinarea redistribution effect on local consumption. When income is redistributed towards highMPC consumers, then the MPC increases, and local consumption will be higher for any level
of income. The second term in brackets captures redistribution of income across areas. Since
spending either accrues in region a or m, we have sa,t + sm,t = 1. Thus, an increase in the
income share of the agricultural area must come at the expense of the manufacturing area.
The third term in brackets captures the aggregate increase in income, which is common to
both the agricultural and the manufacturing area. All these terms are multiplied by the
share of consumption by constrained consumers in local consumption. When few consumers
are constrained then this term is small, so that any of these three terms will only have small
effects on local consumption. By contrast, the second part of this equation, the intertemporal

We assume that initially the importance of high-MPC consumers is the same in the
agricultural and the manufacturing area. That is, sua,t = sum,t = sut , which implies mpca,t =
mpcm,t = mpct . In addition, we assume that the share of consumption by unconstrained

These assumptions imply that, initially, both areas are equally exposed to aggregate fluctuations. Thus, any aggregate effects are differenced out in the cross-section. Importantly, we
only make these assumptions on initial conditions. After redistributing towards high-MPC
farmers, the MPCs and income shares may (and will) differ across regions.
We can now compute the difference in consumption growth across regions, which is one
important component of our cross-sectional regression,

Relative redistribution within areas

Redistribution across areas

The aggregate effects on output and the real interest rate are differenced out, so the relative
consumption growth across regions does not directly tell us about what we are ultimately
interested in. Differences in consumption growth across areas are instead due to the relative effectiveness in redistributing income towards high-MPC consumers (the first term in
brackets) and redistribution across areas (the second term).
The term capturing redistribution across areas is easiest to characterize. The agricultural
areas’ income share change is,

Local exposure to farm channel

The term in square brackets subtracts the local losses from the gains to the farmers. These
are losses by the fraction ζ of local entrepreneurs, ζ(1 − ξ), when mark-ups fall ξ < 1, and
losses by the fraction η of local workers, ηξ, when real wages fall ξ > 0. The second term
captures the local exposure to the farm channel, whereby the aggregate change in the farm
income share is scaled by the local income share.
We obtain an analogous expression for the manufacturing area. The key differences are
that local exposure is negative (since income is redistributed away) and calculated based on
the manufacturing area’s income share,

The first term determines how sensitive the local MPC is to changes in the income share of
constrained consumers. The second term captures how the income share of unconstrained
consumers varies with the farm income share. This consists of how much income we move
towards the constrained farmers and away from constrained workers, θf − θw ηξ, modulated
by the increase in local income to constrained agents (1 − sua,t )(1 − ζ(1 − ξ) − ηξ).61 The
third term is the local exposure to the change in the farm income share.
Analogously, we obtain an expression for the change in the MPC in the manufacturing

The manufacturing MPC decreases with the income losses to constrained workers, −(1 −

income (the denominator) falls.
Combining these expressions we can determine the difference in consumption growth

Relative redistribution towards high-MPC consumers

Local exposure to farm channel

The first term in brackets, θf , captures that redistribution to constrained farmers will raise
consumption in the agricultural area relative to the manufacturing area. The second term
captures how redistribution from unconstrained workers affects the cross-sectional consumption growth rates. Its sign is ambiguous. If η = 1, so all workers reside in the agricultural
area, then this reduction in consumption accrues in the agricultural area and thus reduces
the cross-sectional difference. However, when η is sufficiently small, η < sa,t , then workers’
losses disproportionally accrue in the manufacturing area. In that case the term becomes
positive and amplifies the cross-sectional consumption differences.
Our model-based cross-sectional coefficient is this difference in consumption growth divided by the difference in farm population shares. Let the aggregate farm population share
be φf and the local population shares by φa and φm . Then the difference in farm population

To see the necessity of this last term suppose that only farmers live in the agricultural area, η = ζ =
1. Then redistributing to farmers cannot change the local constrained share sca,t = θf . In this case the
redistribution towards farmers and the local increase in (constrained) income are the same, leaving the ratio
unchanged.

The left-hand-side is what we call the “naive” extrapolation from the cross-section to the aggregate. We simply multiply the cross-sectional coefficient with the national farm population
share. The right-hand-side tells us what this quantity measures. It shares some similarities
with the the aggregate effect (9) we want to uncover, but also some important differences.

effect (9), θf − θw ξ. As an instructive case, these two terms coincide when η = 1. Then both
the losses and the gains to high-MPC consumers accrue only in the agricultural area. So the
manufacturing area provides an appropriate counterfactual for measuring the redistribution
to high-MPC consumers. However, when η < 1, then the cross-sectional term will be larger.
This is because redistributing away from high-MPC consumers in the manufacturing area
reduces manufacturing consumption, which amplifies the cross-sectional coefficient but also
reduces the aggregate effect of redistribution.

our model, the importance of the farm channel for an area is a function of the farm income share, the ratio of local farm income to total local income. The higher the farm
income share, the greater the fraction of local income “treated” by higher farm prices and
the greater the expected consumption growth. The farm population measure (and all our
other available measures) only captures this exposure imperfectly. Farm income and popincome per farmer

Third, there is no multiplier in the cross-sectional expression whereas there is an aggregate
multiplier for the economy as a whole. Even though local MPCs can be quite sizable, a local
multiplier requires that some fraction of spending remains in the local area. Otherwise both
areas benefit equally from higher local spending, which is differenced out in our specification.

In the text we further simplify the redistribution correction to 1 − ξ θθf . This is exact when
the share of worker income accruing to the agricultural region is commensurate to the income
share of the agricultural region, η = sa,t . For reasonable parameterizations of η this is a good
approximation.
