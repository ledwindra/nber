Conventional analyses of wage profiles pool all waqe observations without distin-guishing among individuals according to retirement status.Our empirical analysis suggests the following conclusions.1)Wages for work while not retired and for work while partially retiredare significantly different from one another.2) wage offers facing older workers may vary considerably between those who do and do not face lower limit constraints requiring full-time work or none at all on their main job. 3) Failing to distinguish between wages paid to the partially retired and to the not retired causes a sizable exaggeration of the decline with experience in the wage offer for work while not retired.\n\n",
