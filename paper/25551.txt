Factor Momentum and the Momentum Factor
Sina Ehsani and Juhani T. Linnainmaa
NBER Working Paper No. 25551
February 2019
JEL No. G11,G12,G40
ABSTRACT
Momentum in individual stock returns emanates from momentum in factor returns. Most factors
are positively autocorrelated: the average factor earns a monthly return of 1 basis point following
a year of losses and 53 basis points following a positive year. Factor momentum explains all
forms of individual stock momentum. Stock momentum strategies indirectly time factors: they
profit when the factors remain autocorrelated, and crash when these autocorrelations break down.
Our key result is that momentum is not a distinct risk factor; it aggregates the autocorrelations
found in all other factors.

Introduction

Momentum appears to violate the efficient market hypothesis in its weakest form. Past returns
should not predict future returns if asset prices respond to new information immediately and to
the right extent—unless past returns correlate with changes in systematic risk. Researchers have
sought to explain the profitability of momentum strategies with time-varying risk, behavioral biases,
and trading frictions.1 At the same time, the pervasiveness of momentum over time and across
asset classes has given momentum the status of an independent factor: models without momentum
cannot explain it and those with momentum cannot explain anything more than just momentum
(Fama and French, 2016).2 In this paper we show that momentum is not a distinct risk factor:
it aggregates the autocorrelations found in all other factors. Rather than being unrelated to the
other factors, momentum in fact relates to all of them.
We first show that factors’ prior returns are informative about their future returns. Small
stocks, for example, are likely to outperform big stocks when they have done so over the prior year.
This effect is economically and statistically large among the 20 factors we study: The average factor
earns 52 basis points per month following a year of gains but just 2 basis points following a year
of losses. The difference in these average returns is significant with a t-value of 4.67. This result
is not specific to the use of obscure asset pricing factors: we work with the major factors that are
regularly updated and published by academics and a hedge fund.
A time-series factor momentum strategy is a strategy that bets on this continuation in factor

Figure 1: Individual stock momentum versus factor momentum.
This figure shows tvalues associated with alphas for five momentum strategies that trade individual stocks and a
factor momentum strategy that trades 20 factors. For individual stock momentum strategies, we
report t-values from the five-factor model (yellow bars) and this model augmented with factor
momentum (blue bars). For the factor momentum strategy, we report t-values from the five-factor
model (yellow bar) and this model augmented with all five individual stock momentum strategies
(blue bar). The dashed line denotes a t-value of 1.96.
returns. It is long the factors with positive returns and short those with negative returns. This
time-series momentum strategy earns an annualized return of 4.2% (t-value = 7.04). We show
that this strategy dominates the cross-sectional strategy because it is a pure bet on the positive
autocorrelations in factor returns. A cross-sectional strategy, by contrast, also bets that a high
return on a factor predicts low returns on the other factors (Lo and MacKinlay, 1990); in the data,
however, high return on any factor predicts high returns on all factors.3
Momentum in factor returns transmits into the cross section of security returns, and the amount
that transmits depends on the dispersion in factor loadings. The more these loadings differ across
assets, the more of the factor momentum shows up as cross-sectional momentum in individual
security returns. If stock momentum is about the autocorrelations in factor returns, factor momentum should subsume individual stock momentum. Indeed, we show that a momentum factor
3

Goyal and Jegadeesh (2017) and Huang et al. (2018) note that time-series momentum strategies that trade
individual assets (or futures contracts) are not as profitable as they might seem because they are not zero-net
investment long-short strategies. In factor momentum, however, each “asset” that is traded is already a long-short
strategy. The cross-sectional and time-series factor momentum strategies are therefore directly comparable.

constructed in the space of factor returns describes average returns of portfolios sorted by prior
one-year returns better than Carhart’s (1997) UMD, a factor that directly targets momentum in
stock returns.
Factor momentum also explains other forms of stock momentum: industry momentum, industryadjusted momentum, intermediate momentum, and Sharpe ratio momentum. The left-hand side of
Figure 1 shows that factor momentum renders all individual stock momentum strategies statistically
insignificant. We report two pairs of t-values for each version of momentum. The first is that
associated with the strategy’s Fama and French (2015) five-factor model alpha; the second one
is from the model that adds factor momentum. The right-hand side of the same figure shows
that a five-factor model augmented with all five forms of individual stock momentum leaves factor
momentum with an alpha that is significant with a t-value of 3.96.
Our results suggest that equity momentum is not a distinct risk factor; it is an accumulation of
the autocorrelations in factor returns. A momentum strategy that trades individual securities indirectly times factors. This strategy profits as long as the factors remain positively autocorrelated.
Factors’ autocorrelations, however, vary over time, and an investor trading stock momentum loses
when they turn negative. We show that a simple measure of the continuation in factor returns determines both when momentum crashes and when it earns outsized profits. A theory of momentum
would need to explain, first, why factor returns are typically positively autocorrelated and, second,
why most of the autocorrelations sometimes, and abruptly, turn negative at the same time.
Our results suggest that factor momentum may be a reflection of how assets’ values first diverge
and later converge towards intrinsic values. The strength of factor momentum significantly varies
by investor sentiment of Baker and Wurgler (2006). Conditional on low sentiment, factors that
earned positive return over the prior year outperform those that lost money by 71 basis points
per month (t-value = 4.79). In the high-sentiment environment, this performance gap is just 18

3

basis points (t-value = 1.32). This connection suggests that factor momentum may stem from asset
values drifting away from, and later towards, fundamental values, perhaps because of slow-moving
capital (Duffie, 2010). Under this interpretation, factors may, at least in part, be about mispricing
(Kozak et al., 2018; Stambaugh et al., 2012)
Our results relate to McLean and Pontiff (2016), Avramov et al. (2017), and Zaremba and
Shemer (2017) who show that anomaly returns predict the cross section of anomaly returns at
the one-month and one-year lags. A companion paper to this study, Arnott et al. (2019), shows
that the short-term industry momentum of Moskowitz and Grinblatt (1999) also stems from factor
momentum; it is the short-term cross-sectional factor momentum that explains short-term industry
momentum. That alternative form of factor momentum, however, explains none of individual stock
momentum, consistent with the finding of Grundy and Martin (2001) that industry momentum is
largely unrelated to stock momentum.
We show that the profits of cross-sectional momentum strategies derive almost entirely from the
autocorrelation in factor returns; that time-series factor momentum fully subsumes momentum in
individual stock returns (in all its forms); that the characteristics of stock momentum returns change
predictably alongside the changes in the autocorrelation of factor returns; and that momentum is
not a distinct risk factor—rather, momentum factor aggregates the autocorrelations found in the
other factors. Because almost all factor returns are autocorrelated, for reasons we do not yet
understand, momentum is inevitable. If momentum resides in factors, and if factors across all asset
classes behave similar to the equity factors, momentum will be everywhere.

Data

We take the factor and portfolio data from three public sources: Kenneth French’s, AQR’s, and
Robert Stambaugh’s data libraries.4 Table 1 lists the factors, start dates, average annualized
returns, standard deviations of returns, and t-values associated with the average returns. If the
return data on a factor is not provided, we use the portfolio data to compute the factor return.
We compute factor return as the average return on the three top deciles minus that on the three
bottom deciles, where the top and bottom deciles are defined in the same way as in the original
study.
The 15 anomalies that use U.S. data are accruals, betting against beta, cash-flow to price,
investment, earnings to price, book-to-market, liquidity, long-term reversals, net share issues, quality minus junk, profitability, residual variance, market value of equity, short-term reversals, and
momentum. Except for the liquidity factor of Pástor and Stambaugh (2003), the return data for
these factors begin in July 1963; those for the liquidity factor begin in January 1968. The seven
global factors are betting against beta, investment, book-to-market, quality minus junk, profitability, market value of equity, and momentum. Except for the momentum factor, the return data for
these factors begin in July 1990; those for the momentum factor begin in November 1990. We use
monthly factor returns throughout this study.
Table 1 highlights the significant variation in average annualized returns. The global size factor,
for example, earns 0.4%, while both the U.S. and global betting against beta factors earn 10.0%.
Factors’ volatilities also vary significantly. The global profitability factor has an annualized standard
deviation of returns of 4.9%; that of the U.S. momentum factor is 14.7%.

Factor momentum
Factor returns conditional on past returns

Table 2 shows that factor returns are significantly predictable by their own prior returns. We
estimate time-series regressions in which the dependent variable is a factor’s return in month t, and
the explanatory variable is an indicator variable for the factor’s performance over the prior year
6

from month t − 12 to t − 1. This indicator variables takes the value of one if the factor’s return is
positive, and zero otherwise. We also estimate a pooled regression to measure the average amount
of predictability in factor returns.5
The intercepts in Table 2 measure the average factor returns earned following a year of underperformance. The slope coefficient represents the difference in returns between the up- and
down-years. In these regressions all slope coefficients, except that for the U.S. momentum factor,
are positive and nine of the estimates are significant at the 5% level. Although all factors’ unconditional means are positive (Table 1), the intercepts show that eight anomalies earn a negative
average return following a year of underperformance. The first row shows that the amount of predictability in factor premiums is economically and statistically large. We estimate this regression
using data on all 20 non-momentum factors. The average anomaly earns a monthly return of just
1 basis point (t-value = 0.06) following a year of underperformance. When the anomaly’s return
over the prior year is positive, this return increases by 51 basis points (t-value = 4.67) to 52 basis
points.

3.2

Average returns of time-series and cross-sectional factor momentum strategies

We now measure the profitability of strategies that take long and short positions in factors based on
their prior returns. A time-series momentum strategy is long factors with positive returns over the
prior one-year period (winners) and short factors with negative returns (losers). A cross-sectional
momentum strategy is long factors that earned above-median returns relative to the other factors
over the prior one-year period (winners) and short factors with below-median returns (losers). We

Table A1 in Appendix A.1 shows estimates from regressions of factor returns on prior one-year factor returns. We
present the indicator-variable specification of Table 2 as the main specification because it is analogous to a strategy
that signs the positions in factors based on their prior returns.

Table 2: Average factor returns conditional on their own past returns
The table reports estimates from univariate regressions in which the dependent variable is a factor’s
monthly return and the independent variable takes the value of one if the factor’s average return
over the prior year is positive and zero otherwise. We estimate these regressions using pooled data
(first row) and separately for each anomaly (remaining rows). In the pooled regression, we cluster
the standard errors by month.

and individual stock momentum. The two factor momentum strategies therefore trade a maximum

of 20 factors; the number of factors starts at 13 in July 1964 and increases to 20 by July 1991
because of the variation in the factors’ start dates (Table 1).
Table 3 shows the average returns for the time-series and cross-sectional factor momentum
strategies as well as an equal-weighted portfolio of all 20 factors. The annualized return on the
average factor is 4.2% with a t-value of 7.60. In the cross-sectional strategy, both the winner and
loser portfolios have, by definition, the same number of factors. In the time-series strategy, the
number of factors in these portfolios varies. For example, if there are five factors with above-zero
returns and 15 factors with below-zero returns over the one-year period, then the winner strategy is
long five factors and the loser strategy is long the remaining 15 factors. The time-series momentum
strategy takes positions in all 20 factors with the sign of the position in each factor determined by
the factor’s prior return. We report the returns both for the factor momentum strategies as well as
for the loser and winner portfolios underneath these strategies. These loser and winner strategies
are equal-weighted portfolios..
Consistent with the results on the persistence in factor returns in Table 2, both winner strategies
outperform the equal-weighted benchmark, and the loser strategies underperform it. The portfolio
of time-series winners earns an average return of 6.3% with a t-value of 9.54, and cross-sectional
winners earn an average return of 7.0% with a t-value of 8.98. The two loser portfolios earn average
returns of 0.3% and 1.4%, and the t-values associated with these averages are 0.31 and 1.95.
The momentum strategies are about the spreads between the winner and loser portfolios. The
time-series factor momentum strategy earns an annualized return of 4.2% (t-value = 7.04); the
cross-sectional strategy earns a return of 2.8% (t-value = 5.74). Because time-series losers earn
premiums that are close to zero, the choice of being long or short a factor following periods of
negative returns is inconsequential from the viewpoint of average returns. However, by diversifying
across all factors, the time-series momentum strategy has a lower standard deviation than the

Table 3: Average returns of time-series and cross-sectional factor momentum strategies
This table reports annualized average returns, standard deviations, and Sharpe ratios for different
combinations of up to 20 factors. The number of factors increases from 13 in July 1964 to 20
by July 1991 (see Table 1). The equal-weighted portfolio invests in all factors with the same
weights. The time-series factor momentum strategy is long factors with positive returns over the
prior one-year period (winners) and short factors with negative returns (losers). The cross-sectional
momentum strategy is long factors that earned above-median returns relative to other factors over
the prior one-year period (winners) and short factors with below-median returns (losers). The timeseries strategy is on average long 11.0 factors and short 5.8 factors. The cross-sectional strategy is
balanced because it selects factors based on their relative performance. We rebalance all strategies

winner portfolio alone (4.3% versus 4.7%).
The difference between time-series and cross-sectional factor momentum strategies is statistically significant. In a regression of the time-series strategy on the cross-sectional strategy, the
estimated slope is 1.0 and the alpha of 1.4% is significant with a t-value of 4.44. In the reverse
regression of the cross-sectional strategy on time-series strategy, the estimated slope is 0.7 and the
alpha of −0.2% has a t-value of −1.02. The time-series factor momentum therefore subsumes the
cross-sectional strategy, but not vice versa.
An important feature of factor momentum is that, unlike factor investing, it is “model-free.”
If factors are autocorrelated, an investor can capture the resulting momentum premium without
prespecifying which leg of the factor on average earns a higher return. Consider, for example,
the SMB factor. This factor earns an average return of 27 basis points per month (see Table 2),
but its premium is 55 basis points following a positive year and −15 basis points after a negative

10

Figure 2: Profitability of time-series and cross-sectional factor momentum strategies,
July 1964–December 2015. This figure displays total return on an equal-weighted portfolio of
all factors and the returns on factors partitioned into winners and losers by their past performance.
Time-series winners and losers are factors with above- or below-zero return over the prior oneyear period. Cross-sectional winners and losers are factors that have out- or underperformed the
median factor over this formation period. Each portfolio is rebalanced monthly and each portfolio’s
standard deviation is standardized to equal to that of the equal-weighted portfolio.
year. For the momentum investor, this factor’s “name” is inconsequential. By choosing the sign
of the position based on the factor’s prior return, this investor earns an average return of 55 basis
points per month by trading the “SMB” factor after small stocks have outperformed big stocks;
and a return of 15 basis points per month by trading a “BMS” factor after small stocks have
underperformed big stocks.
Figure 2 plots the cumulative returns associated the equal-weighted portfolio and the winner
and loser portfolios of Table 3. We leverage each strategy in this figure so that each strategy’s
volatility is equal to that of the equal-weighted portfolio. Consistent with its near zero monthly
premium, the total return on the time-series loser strategy remains close to zero even at the end
of the 52-year sample period. The time-series winner strategy, by contrast, has earned three times
as much as the passive strategy by the end of the sample period. Although the cross-sectional

11

winner strategy in Panel A of Table 3 earns the highest average return, it is more volatile, and so
it underperforms the time-series winner strategy on a volatility-adjusted basis. The cross-sectional
loser strategy earns a higher return than the time-series loser strategy: factors that underperformed
other factors but that still earned positive returns tend to earn positive returns the next month.
The winner-minus-loser gap is therefore considerably wider for the time-series strategies than what
it is for the cross-sectional strategies.

3.3

Decomposing factor momentum profits: Why does the cross-sectional strategy underperform the time-series strategy?

We use the Lo and MacKinlay (1990) and Lewellen (2002) decompositions to measure the sources
of profits to the cross-sectional and time-series factor momentum strategies. The cross-sectional
decomposition chooses portfolio weights that are proportional to demeaned past returns. The
weight on factor f in month t is positive if the factor’s past return is above average and negative
if it is below average:7

t − 1 and r̄−t is the cross-sectional average of all factors’ returns over the same formation period.
The month-t return that results from the position in factor f is therefore

− r̄−t ) rtf ,

(2)

The key idea of the Lo and MacKinlay (1990) decomposition is the observation that, by creating a strategy with
weights proportional to past returns, the strategy’s expected return is the expected product of lagged and future
returns. This expected product can then be expressed as the product of expectations plus the covariance of returns.

where Ω = E (r−t
− µ)(rtf − µ)0 is the autocovariance matrix of factor returns, Tr(Ω) is the trace
of this matrix, and σµ2 is the cross-sectional variance of mean factor returns.
The representation in equation (4) separates cross-sectional momentum profits to three sources:
1. Autocorrelation in factor returns: a past high factor return signals future high return,
2. Negative cross-covariances: a past high factor return signals low returns on other factors, and
3. Cross-sectional variance of mean returns: some factors earn persistently high or low returns.
The last term is independent of the autocovariance matrix; that is, factor “momentum” can emerge
even in the absence of any time-series predictability (Conrad and Kaul, 1998). A cross-sectional
strategy is long the factors with the highest past returns and short the factors with the lowest
past returns; therefore, if past returns are good estimates of factors’ unconditional means, a crosssectional momentum strategy earns positive returns even in the absence of auto- and cross-serial
covariance patterns.
Table 4 shows that the cross-sectional strategy in equation (4) earns an average annualized

Panel A reports the amount that each term in equation (4) contributes to the profits of the crosssectional factor momentum strategy. Panel B reports the contributions of the terms in equation (5)
to the profits of the time-series factor momentum strategies. We report the premiums in percentages
per year. We multiply the cross-covariance term by −1 so that these terms represent their net
contributions to the returns of the cross-sectional and time-series strategies. We compute the
standard errors by block bootstrapping the factor return data by month. When month t is sampled,
we associate month t with the factors’ average returns from month t − 12 to t − 1 to compute the
terms in the decomposition.

return of 2.5% with a t-value of 3.49. The autocovariance term contributes an average of 2.9%,
more than all of the cross-sectional strategy’s profits. The cross-covariance term is positive and,
therefore, it negatively contributes (−1.0% per year) to this cross-sectional strategy’s profits. A
positive return on a factor predicts positive returns also on the other factors, and the cross-sectional
strategy loses by trading against this cross-predictability. This negative term more than offsets the
positive contribution of the cross-sectional variation in means (0.5% per year).
Whereas the cross-sectional strategy’s weights are based on the factors’ relative performance,
those of the time-series strategy are based on the factors’ absolute performance. The time-series
strategy is a pure bet on factor autocorrelations; in principle, this strategy could be long or short all
factors at the same time whereas the cross-sectional strategy is always a balanced mix of long and
short positions. The weight on factor f in month t is now just its return over the formation period,

where the definitions are the same as those in equation (3). Equation (5) shows that the time-series
momentum profits stem either from autocorrelation in factor returns or from mean returns that
are either very positive or negative.
Table 4 shows that the monthly premium of the time-series strategy is 4.9% with a t-value of
4.65. The decomposition of these profits into the autocorrelation and mean-squared components
shows that this premium largely derives from the autocorrelation in factor returns; the annualized
premiums associated with these two components are 3.0% (t-value of 2.61) and 1.9% with (t-value
= 4.49). The time-series strategy outperforms the cross-sectional strategy because it does not bet
on factors exhibiting negative cross-covariance; it is a pure bet on the autocorrelations in factor
returns.

4.1

Factor momentum and individual stock momentum
Transmission of factor momentum into the cross section of stock returns:
Framework

If stock returns obey a factor structure, then factor momentum transmits into the cross section
of stock returns in the form of cross-sectional stock momentum of Jegadeesh and Titman (1993).
In multifactor models of asset returns, such as the Intertemporal CAPM of Merton (1973) and
the Arbitrage Pricing Theory of Ross (1976), multiple sources of risk determine expected returns.

15

Consider a factor model in which asset excess returns obey an F -factor structure,

Rs,t =

F
X

βsf rtf + εs,t ,

(6)

f =1

where Rs is stock s’s excess return, rf is the return on factor f , βsf is stock s’s beta on factor
f , and εs is the stock-specific return component that should not command a risk premium in the
absence of arbitrage. We assume that the factors do not exhibit any lead-lag relationships with the
stock-specific return components, that is, E[rtf0 εs,t ] = 0.
We now assume that asset prices evolve according to equation (6) and examine the payoffs to a
cross-sectional momentum strategy; this strategy, as before, chooses weights that are proportional
to stocks’ performance relative to the cross-sectional average. The expected payoff to the position
in stock s is


mom
E[πs,t
] = E (Rs,−t − R̄−t )(Rs,t − R̄t ) ,

where R̄ is the return on an equal-weighted index. Under the return process of equation (6), this
expected profit becomes

where N is the number of stocks and σβ2f and ση2 are the cross-sectional variances of the portfolio
loadings and unconditional expected returns.
Equation (9) shows that the profits of the cross-sectional stock momentum strategy can emanate
from four sources:
1. Positive autocorrelation in factor returns induces momentum profits through the first term.
Cross-sectional variation in betas amplifies this effect.
2. The lead-lag return relationships between factors could also contribute to stock momentum
profits. The strength of this effect depends both on the cross-serial covariance in factor
returns and the covariances between factor loadings. This condition is restrictive: the crossserial correlation of returns and the covariances of betas have to have the same signs. It would
need to be, for example, that (1) SMB return in period 1 positively predicts HML returns in
period 2 and (2) that SMB and HML loadings also positively correlate. For this channel to
matter, this condition would need be satisfied for the average pair of factors.8
3. Autocorrelation in stocks’ residual returns can also contribute to the profitability of the crosssectional momentum strategy.
8
In Appendix A.3 we show that this term is negligible relative to the autocovariance term in the five-factor model
because of this joint condition.

17

4. The cross-sectional variation in mean returns of individual securities can also contribute to
momentum profits. If stocks’ past returns are good estimates of their unconditional means,
a cross-sectional momentum is long stocks with high mean returns and short those with low
means (Conrad and Kaul, 1998).

4.2

Explaining the returns on portfolios sorted on equity momentum

Does factor momentum contribute to the returns of cross-sectional momentum strategies? We focus
on the role of the first term of equation (9); this is the term through which the autocorrelation
in factor returns could add to the profits of cross-sectional momentum strategies. We measure
the connection between the profitability of these strategies and time-series factor momentum. The
time-series factor momentum strategy is the same as above: it is long factors that have earned
positive returns over the prior year and short those that have earned negative returns.
In Table 5 we compare the performance of three asset pricing models in pricing portfolios
sorted by prior one-year returns skipping a month; the sorting variable is the same as that used
to construct the UMD factor of Carhart (1997).9 The first model is the Fama-French five-factor
model; the second model is this model augmented with the UMD factor; and the third model is
the five-factor model augmented with the factor time-series momentum strategy. We report alphas
for the deciles and, for the models 2 and 3, the factor loadings against UMD and factor time-series
momentum.
Stock momentum is evident in the alphas of the Fama-French five-factor model. The alpha
for the loser portfolio is −0.78% per month (t-value = −4.06) and for the winner portfolio it is
0.61% (t-value = 4.89). The average absolute alpha across the deciles is 27 basis points. We
significantly improve the model’s ability to price these portfolios by adding Carhart’s momentum
9

We use the portfolio return data made available by Kenneth French at http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/
faculty/ken.french/data_library.html as the test assets.

Table 5: Time-series regressions on momentum sorted portfolios
This table compares the performance of three asset pricing models in explaining the monthly
excess returns on ten portfolios sorted by prior one-year returns skipping a month. The three
models are: (1) the Fama-French five-factor model with the market, size, value, profitability, and
investment factors; (2) the five-factor model augmented with Carhert’s UMD factor; and (3) the
five-factor model augmented with the time-series factor momentum strategy. The time-series factor
momentum strategy is long the factors with positive prior one-year returns and short those with
negative prior one-year returns. The 20 factors used in constructing this strategy are listed in
Table 1. We report alphas for each of the three models and loadings against the UMD factor and
the time-series factor momentum strategy. We compute Gibbons et al. (1989) test statistics using
the returns on the decile portfolios. This test statistic is distributed as F (N, T − N − 1) under the
null hypothesis that the alphas are jointly zero, where N = 10 is the number of test assets and
T = 618 is the number of observations in the time series. The sample period starts in July 1964
and ends in December 2015.

factor. The average absolute monthly alpha falls to 13 basis points, and the profitability of the
long-short portfolio falls from 1.4% to 0.3%. Yet, the alpha associated with the long-short portfolio
is statistically significant with a t-value of 2.53. The UMD slope monotonically increases from
−0.92 to 0.58 as we move from the bottom to top decile.
The model augmented with the time-series factor momentum strategy performs just as well
as—or even better than—the Carhart (1997) six-factor model in pricing the momentum portfolios.
The average absolute alpha falls to 12 basis points per month; the Gibbons et al. (1989) test statistic
falls from 3.26 to 2.55; and the alpha of the high-minus low falls from 0.29% to 0.24% (t-value =
1.09). Similar to the Carhart (1997) model, the estimated slopes against the factor momentum
strategy increase monotonically from bottom decile’s −2.44 to top decile’s 1.43.
The fact that the five-factor model augmented with factor momentum performs as well as the
model augmented with UMD is surprising. The Carhart six-factor model sets a high standard because both the factor and the test assets sort on the same variable; that is, UMD targets momentum
as directly as, say, HML targets portfolios sorted by book-to-market.

4.3

Alternative momentum factors: Spanning tests

In Table 6 we show that, in addition to the “standard” individual stock momentum of Jegadeesh
and Titman (1993), factor momentum fully subsumes the informativeness of other cross-sectional
momentum strategies.10 In addition to the UMD factor, which sorts by stocks’ prior one-year
returns skipping a month, we construct three other momentum factors using the same methodology:
Industry-adjusted momentum of Cohen and Polk (1998) sorts stocks’ by their industry-adjusted
returns; intermediate momentum of Novy-Marx (2012) sorts stocks by their returns from month
10
We use the term “span” to indicate that an unconstrained investor trading the right-hand-side factors would
not gain anything by trading the left-hand side strategy. See, for example, Novy-Marx (2013) and Fama and French
(2015). Tests of mean-variance spanning also constrain the betas to add up to one (Kan and Zhou, 2012). We could
alter the implicit leverage of the factor momentum strategy to set the sum of the beta to one.

20

t−12 to t−7; and Sharpe ratio momentum of Rachev et al. (2007) sorts stocks by the returns scaled
by the volatility of returns. We also construct the industry momentum strategy of Moskowitz and
Grinblatt (1999). This strategy sorts 20 industries based on their prior six-month returns and takes
long and short positions in the top and bottom three industries.
Panel A of Table 6 introduces the alternative momentum factors alongside the time-series factor
momentum strategy. Each factor earns statistically significant average returns and Fama-French
five-factor model alphas. Although the average return associated with the time-series momentum
strategy is the lowest—0.35% per month—it is also the least volatile by a wide margin. Its Sharpe
and information ratio, which are proportional to the t-values associated with the average returns
and five-factor model alphas, are therefore the highest among all the factors.
The first two columns of Panel B show estimates from spanning regressions in which the dependent variable is one of the momentum factors. The model is the Fama-French five factor model
augmented with factor momentum. These regressions can be interpreted both from the investment
and asset pricing perspectives. From an investment perspective, a statistically significant alpha
implies that an investor would have earned a higher Sharpe ratio by having traded the left-hand
side factor in addition to the right-hand side factors (Huberman and Kandel, 1987). From an asset
pricing perspective, a statistically significant alpha implies that the asset pricing model that only
contains the right-hand side variables is dominated by a model that also contains the left-hand side
factor (Barillas and Shanken, 2017).
Although all definitions of momentum earn statistically significant average returns and fivefactor model alphas, factor momentum spans all of them. Consistent with Table 5, time-series
factor momentum leaves standard momentum (UMD) with an alpha of 0.01% per month (t-value
= 0.07). Table 6 shows that factor momentum also spans the other four forms of momentum. The
maximum t-value across the five specifications is intermediate momentum’s 1.64.

21

Table 6: Alternative definitions of momentum: Spanning tests
Panel A reports monthly average returns and Fama-French five-factor model alphas for alternative
momentum factors. Every factor, except for industry momentum, is similar to the UMD factor
of Jegadeesh and Titman (1993) (“standard momentum”). We sort stocks into six portfolios by
market values of equity and prior performance. A momentum factor’s return is the average return
on the two high portfolios minus that on the two low portfolios. Industry momentum uses the
Moskowitz and Grinblatt (1999) methodology; it is long the top three industries based on prior
six-month returns and short the bottom three industries, where each stock is classified into one of
20 industries following (Moskowitz and Grinblatt, 1999, Table I). Panel A also reports references for
the original studies that use these alternative definitions. Panel B reports estimates from spanning
regressions in which the dependent variable is the monthly return on either one of the momentum
factors or factor momentum. When the dependent variable is one of the momentum factors, we
estimate regressions that augment the five-factor model with factor momentum. We report the
intercepts and the slopes for factor momentum. When the dependent variable is factor momentum,
we estimate regressions that augment the five-factor model with one of the momentum factors or,
on the last row, with all five momentum factors, We report the intercepts and the slopes for the
momentum factors. The sample begins in July 1964 and ends in December 2015.

All of above
† Note:

This regression includes all six individual stock momentum factors as explanatory variables in addition to the five factors

of the Fama-French five-factor model: standard momentum, industry-adjusted momentum, industry momentum, intermediate
momentum, and Sharpe ratio momentum.

no other form of momentum is at all informative about the cross section of stock returns when
controlling for factor momentum.
Factor momentum’s ability to span individual stock momentum, but not vice versa, suggests
that individual stock momentum is a manifestation of factor momentum. An investor who trades
individual stock momentum indirectly times factors, and an investor who directly times factors
performs better. The indirect method loses out because it also takes positions based on noise. The
other possible sources of momentum profits do not contribute to these profits, and so their inclusion
renders the strategy unnecessarily volatile.

Individual stock momentum versus factor momentum with alternative sets
of factors

The factor momentum strategy takes positions in up to 20 factors. Tables 5 and 6 show that this
“full” version of factor momentum explains individual stock momentum. In Figure 3 we measure
23

Figure 3: Individual stock momentum versus factor momentum as a function of the
number of factors. We form random subsets of the 20 non-momentum factors listed in Table 1
and form time-series factor momentum strategies that trade these factors. A time-series factor
momentum strategy is long factors with positive returns over the prior year and short those with
negative returns. In this figure the number of factors ranges from 1 to 20. The thick line represents
the factor momentum strategy’s average t(α̂) from the Fama-French five-factor model regression;
the thin line represents UMD’s average t(α̂) from a regression that augments the five-factor model
with the factor momentum strategy; and the dashed line denotes UMD’s t(α̂) from the Fama-French
five-factor model regression. The shaded region indicates t-values below 1.96.
the extent to which this result is sensitive to the number and identity of the factors included in
factor momentum.
In this figure we construct random combinations of factors, ranging from one factor to the full
set of 20 factors. We then construct a factor momentum strategy that trades this random set of
factors and estimate two regressions. The first regression is the Fama-French five-factor model and
the dependent variable is the factor momentum strategy. The dependent variable in the second
regression is UMD and the model is the is the Fama-French five-factor model augmented with
factor momentum. We draw 20,000 random combinations of factors for each set size, record the
t-values associated with the alphas from these models, and then plot averages of these t-values as
a function of the number of factors. In Figure 3 we also show, for reference, the t-value associated
with UMD’s alpha in the five-factor model.

24

Figure 3 shows that the t-value associated with factor momentum’s five-factor model alpha
monotonically increases in the number of factors. When the strategy alternates between long and
short positions in just one factor, the average t-value is 2.91; when it trades 10 factors, it is 6.30;
and when we reach 20 factors, it is 7.05. At the same time, factor momentum’s ability to span
UMD improves. The typical one-factor factor momentum strategy leaves UMD with an alpha that
is statistically significant with a t-value of 2.96. However, when the number of factors increases to
10, this average t-value has decreased to 1.24; and with all 20 factors, this t-value is 0.07. These
estimates suggest that factor momentum’s ability to span UMD is not specific to the set of factors
used; as the number of factors increases, the autocorrelations found within most sets of factors
aggregate to explain individual stock momentum. Figure 3 supports our thesis that individual
stock momentum is an aggregation of the autocorrelations found in factor returns; the more factors
we identify, the better we capture UMD’s return.

An analysis of momentum crashes

Individual stock momentum sometimes crashes.11 If the profits of momentum strategies emanate
from factor autocorrelations, then momentum crashes should stem from changes in these autocorrelations. This represents an additional testable prediction of the proposition that factor momentum
drives individual stock momentum. We test for this connection by creating a proxy of the first
term in equation (9) for the average factor. We can rewrite this term as a function of factor
11

See, for example, Barroso and Santa-Clara (2015) and Daniel and Moskowitz (2016).

return from month t − 12 to t − 1 and σρ2s,f ×σs is the cross-sectional variance of stock s’s correlation
with factor f (ρs,f ) multiplied its volatility (σs ). If this cross-sectional-dispersion term does not
vary significantly across factors, momentum profits directly relate to the summation of factor
autocorrelations.
We create an aggregate factor autocorrelation index to proxy for the term in equation (10). We
first define factor f ’s autocorrelation in month t as

where µ and σ are the factor’s mean and standard deviation over the sample period. The aggregate
factor autocorrelation index in month t is the cross-sectional average of these autocorrelations. A
positive autocorrelation index in month t indicates that the average factor in month t moved in the
same direction as its return during the past year.
In Figure 4 we divide the sample into two regimes based on the sign of the autocorrelation index
and then draw UMD’s return distribution conditional on the regime. In the positive-autocorrelation
regime, in which the average factor continues to move in the same direction as it did over the prior

year, UMD’s returns are typically positive. In these month’s UMD’s average return is 2.4% and
its volatility is 3.3%. In the negative-autocorrelation regime, in which the average factor “turns”
against its own past, UMD earns an average return of −1.6% with a standard deviation of 4.4%.13
The connection between the sign of the autocorrelation index and UMD is not limited to the
first two moments. Figure 4 shows that almost all of UMD’s left tail—its crashes—concentrates
in months when the autocorrelation index is negative. The 5th percentile of UMD’s return in the
positive regime is −1.9%; in the negative regime it is −8.8%.
These estimates support the proposition that factor momentum emerges as momentum in the
cross section of stock returns. An investor who trades individual stock momentum need to look at
the individual positions to know whether the strategy turned a profit or a loss in month t. The
amount of continuation in factor returns, or the lack therefore, is already a good indicator of UMD’s

performance.
In Appendix A.5, we show that the factor autocorrelation index significantly correlates with
momentum crashes and “booms.” A one unit increase in this index lowers the probability of a
momentum crash by 15% (z-value = −6.78). Factor momentum therefore explains all of UMD’s
returns unconditionally—and the changes in the factor autocorrelations explain when momentum
is likely to crash. When factor momentum ceases, the resulting “reversal” in factor returns feeds
into stock returns and crashes stock momentum.

Momentum is not a distinct risk factor
Conditional correlations between factors and the momentum “factor”

If the autocorrelation in factor returns contributes to the profits of these strategies, then these
strategies should be more profitable when the “realized” autocorrelation in factor returns is positive.
We first examine the connection between factor momentum and individual stock momentum
by measuring factors’ correlations with Carhart’s (1997) UMD factor. In Table 7 we report three
correlations estimates for each factor: unconditional correlation, correlation conditional on the
factor’s return over the prior one-year period being positive, and correlation conditional on this
return being negative.
Table 7 shows that the unconditional correlations between the factors and UMD are low; 11 out
of the 20 correlations with the individual factors are positive, and the correlation between UMD
and the portfolio of all 20 factors is 0.05. The correlations conditional on past returns, however,
are remarkably different. Except for the short-term reversals factor, all factors correlate more with
UMD when their past returns are positive. For 17 of these 19 factors, the difference is statistically
significant at the 5% level. On the first row, we assign all factors into two groups each month based
on their past returns. The estimates show that the basket of factors with positive past returns has

Table 7: Unconditional and conditional correlations with the equity momentum factor (UMD)
This table reports correlations between UMD and factor returns: ρ is UMD’s unconditional correlation with the raw factor; ρ+ is the correlation with the factor conditional on the factor’s return over
the prior year being positive; and ρ− is the correlation conditional on the prior-year return being
negative. The first row shows the estimates for a diversified factor which is defined as the average of
the 20 factors. The conditional correlations on this row are computed by averaging factors with positive or negative returns over the prior year. The last two columns report statistics for the test that

Because the unconditional correlations between momentum and the other factors are close to
zero, most factor models, such as the five-factor model, explain none of momentum profits. This
result, however, does not imply that momentum is “unrelated” to the other factors. Table 7 shows
that the unconditional correlations are close to zero only because these correlations are significantly
time-varying. Momentum, in fact, appears to relate to all factors!

4.6.2

Diversification benefits?

An implication of the connection between factor momentum and individual stock momentum is that
the diversification benefits of momentum are more elusive than what the unconditional correlations
might suggest. Consider, for example, the interaction between value and momentum. Table 7 shows
that UMD’s unconditional correlation with the U.S. HML is −0.17 and that with the global HML
is −0.16. These negative correlations are consistent with the findings of Asness et al. (2013). This
same table, however, shows that these correlations vary greatly depending on HML’s performance
over the prior year. In the U.S., for example, the correlation is 0.22 following a year in which HML
earned a positive return and −0.57 following a negative year. These switching signs matter because
HML’s return also depends on its prior returns—this is the essence of factor momentum! The
U.S. HML earns an average monthly return of 15 basis points after a negative year and a return of
43 basis points after a positive year (see Table 2).
Because of this interaction between individual stock momentum, value, and the autocorrelation
in HML’s returns, the diversification benefits of mixing momentum and value are limited. Figure 5
illustrates this issue by considering the 50-50 momentum/value strategy of Asness et al. (2013) and
an alternative dynamic version of this strategy that sometimes replaces value with cash.14 If HML
14

In this analysis, we use the “all equity” value and momentum factors made available by AQR at https://www.
aqr.com/Insights/Datasets. The difference between the AQR and Fama-French value factors is that Asness et al.
(2013) divide the book values of equity by the end-of-June rather than end-of-December market values of equity
(Asness and Frazzini, 2013).

Figure 5: Returns to diversifying momentum with value versus cash. This figure shows
total cumulative returns to two strategies that invest in momentum, value, and cash. The static
strategy always invests 50% in momentum and 50% in value. The dynamic strategy invests 50%
in momentum and 50% in value if value’s return over the prior one-year period is positive and
50% in momentum and 50% in cash if its return is negative. Because value and momentum are
zero-investment portfolios, the return on cash is set to zero. The dynamic strategy is drawn in red
when the strategy is momentum-value and in blue when it is momentum-cash.
has earned a positive annual return up to month t, this strategy is the 50-50 momentum/value
strategy. However, if HML’s return has been negative, this strategy becomes momentum/cash.
Here, because both momentum and value are zero-investment portfolios, we set cash’s return to
zero—this position would finance a purchase of T-bills with T-bills. Figure 5 shows that there is no
meaningful difference between the original and dynamic strategies; an investor draws no benefits
from the negative correlation.
This result is not specific to value’s correlation with momentum. Table 7 shows that almost
all factors “diversify” momentum better after they have performed poorly. The same issue thus
applies to almost all factors: when a factor correlates negatively with momentum, it typically is
also the state in which the factor does not earn a meaningful premium.15 These state-dependent

The short-term reversals factor is the only exception. Arnott et al. (2019) examine the diversification benefits of

Table 8: Factor returns conditional on sentiment and factor momentum
This table reports average returns on factors conditional on past factor returns and investor sentiment. Investor sentiment is defined in the same way as in Stambaugh et al. (2012). Winner factors
are those that earned positive returns over the prior year; losing factors are those that earned
negative returns. The winner and loser portfolios are equal-weighted portfolios of factors. The
winner-minus-loser is the return difference between the two portfolios.

correlations are the direct consequence of the nature of momentum—momentum is not something

Investor sentiment and factor momentum

Stambaugh et al. (2012) show that many return anomalies are stronger following high levels of
sentiment, and that this effect originates from the anomalies’ short legs. They suggest that these
findings are consistent with a mispricing interpretation for the anomalies: anomalies may be due
to mispricing that is particularly persistent in the presence of short-sale restrictions.
Factor momentum may be a different manifestation of the same mechanism. If a segment of
the market—such as growth stocks—becomes overpriced, this overpricing may take time to correct
itself because of short-sale restrictions and, more broadly, slow-moving capital (Duffie, 2010). That
is, asset prices do not immediately jump back to the fundamental levels but, rather, they converge
over time.
Following Stambaugh et al. (2012), we take the residual from a regression of the monthly
sentiment index of Baker and Wurgler (2006) against a set of macroeconomic variables as a measure
momentum, (short-term) factor momentum, and short-term reversals

32

of investor sentiment. The intuition is that this residual represents optimism and pessimism that
is not justified by the state of the macroeconomy.
In Table 8 we measure the interaction between investor sentiment and factor momentum. We
assign month t into a high or low sentiment regime depending on whether month t’s sentiment is
above or below median; and, similar to the winner and loser portfolios in Table 3, we classify each
factor as a winner or loser depending on the sign of its average return over the prior year. The
average underperforming factor earns a negative return of −22 basis points (t-value = −2.10) in the
low-sentiment environment; in the same environment, factors with positive returns over the prior
year earn a premium of 50 basis points (t-value = 6.11). This 71-basis point difference is significant
with a t-value of 4.79. In the high-sentiment environment, however, the difference is just 18 basis
points (a t-value of 1.32).16
The difference between the two regimes is due to the loser factors. In the high sentiment
environment, the average return on prior losers is significantly higher than in the low sentiment
environment. This is the Stambaugh et al. (2012) finding: the average factor earns a higher return in the high-sentiment environment. The results in Table 8 are consistent with a mispricing
interpretation for factor momentum and, by extension, all manifestation of individual stock momentum. A mispricing may take time to build up and, because of impediments to arbitrage, an
asset’s value does not immediately snap back to its fundamental value when arbitrageurs enter.
Factor momentum may stem from asset values drifting back towards fundamental values.
16

In Appendix A.6 we confirm the findings of Stambaugh et al. (2012) by estimating regressions that explain
each factor’s returns with both investor sentiment and past factor returns. Both sentiment and past factor returns
positively predict factor returns, and neither variable subsumes the other.

Conclusion

Positive autocorrelation is a pervasive feature of factor returns. Factors with positive returns over
the prior year earn significant premiums; those with negative returns earn premiums that are
indistinguishable from zero. Factor momentum is a strategy that bets on these autocorrelations in
factor returns.
We link factor momentum to individual stock momentum by decomposing stock momentum
profits under the assumption that stock returns follow a factor structure. This representation shows
that the autocorrelations in factor returns transmit into the cross section of stock returns through
the variation in stocks’ factor loadings. Consistent with this decomposition, we show that factor
momentum explains both the “standard” momentum of Jegadeesh and Titman (1993) and other
forms of it: industry-adjusted momentum, industry momentum, intermediate momentum, and
Sharpe momentum. By contrast, these other momentum factors do not explain factor momentum.
Our results imply that momentum is not a distinct factor; rather, a momentum “factor” is the
summation of the autocorrelations found in the other factors. An investor who trades momentum
indirectly times factors. The profits and losses of this strategy therefore ultimately depend on
whether the autocorrelations in factor returns remain positive.
An additional testable implication of the proposition that individual stock momentum stems
from factor momentum relates to momentum crashes. If individual stock momentum is, in the end,
about factors, then momentum crashes should trace back to the factors as well. Indeed, we show
that momentum crashes when the autocorrelations in factor returns abruptly cease. These results
can guide future research. A theory of momentum would need to explain why factors are typically
positively autocorrelated—and why, sometimes, almost all of these autocorrelations turn negative
at the same time.
Our results imply that individual stock momentum is unlikely about firm-specific news—most
34

factors are so well diversified that they likely wash out all remnants of firm-specific information.
Our results on the connection between factor momentum and investor sentiment suggest that the
autocorrelation in factor returns, and, by extension, individual stock momentum, may stem from
mispricing. Factor returns may positively autocorrelate because mispricings slowly mean-revert:
prices of assets that have been pushed away from fundamentals must later drift towards these
fundamental values as arbitrageurs enter to profit from the mispricings.

A.1

Autocorrelations in factor returns

Table 2 in the main text reports estimates from regressions in which the dependent variable is a
factor’s return in month t and the explanatory variable is an indicator variable that takes the value
of one if the factor’s return over the prior year is positive and zero other. In Table A1 we measure
autocorrelations in factor returns by regressing a factor’s return against the factor’s realized return
over the prior year.

A.2

Cross-sectional and time-series factor momentum strategies with different
formation and holding periods

In the main text we form both the cross-sectional and time-series factor momentum strategies using
prior one-year returns and rebalance these strategies monthly. Table A2 examines the performance
of these strategies with formation and holding periods ranging from one month to two years. When
the holding period is longer than a month, we use the overlapping portfolio approach of Jegadeesh
and Titman (1993) to correct the standard errors. In month t, the return on a strategy with a
k-month formation period is computed as the average return across h portfolios, where h is the
length of the holding period. We construct these h strategies every month between months t − 1
and t − h. This approach produces a single time series for each formation period-holding period
combination.
Panel A of Table A2 examines the performance of time-series factor momentum strategies. The
time-series strategy with the one-month formation and holding periods earns an average return
of 35 basis points (t-value = 6.61). These strategies typically remain profitable also with longer
formation and holding periods. All time-series momentum strategies are the most profitable when

Table A1: Autocorrelations in factor returns
The table reports estimates from univariate regressions in which the dependent variable is a factor’s
monthly return and the independent variable is the factor’s average return over the prior year. We
estimate these regressions using pooled data (first row) and separately for each anomaly (remaining
rows). In the pooled regression, we cluster the standard errors by month.

cannot immediately rebalance away from factors whose average returns turn negative.
Panel B of Table A2 shows that cross-sectional momentum performs the best with one-month
formation and holding periods. This strategy’s average return is 31 basis points per month with

This table reports annualized average returns and t-values for time-series and cross-sectional factor
momentum strategies that trade the 20 non-momentum factors listed in Table 1. The time-series
factor momentum strategy is long factors with positive returns over a formation period that ranges
from one month to two years and short factors with negative returns. The cross-sectional momentum strategy is long factors that earned above-median returns relative to other factors over
the same formation period and short factors with below-median returns. We let the rebalancing
frequency range from one month to two years. When the holding period is longer than a month, we
use the Jegadeesh and Titman (1993) approach correct standard errors for the overlapping holding
periods returns.

a t-value of 5.98—the largest among all cross-sectional strategies. The profits on this short-term
strategy decay quickly: the return on a strategy with one-month formation and three-month holding
period is small and insignificant. Some of the strategies with longer formation periods, although less
profitable initially, earn statistically significant profits at the three- and six-month holding periods.

A.3

Measuring the effects of the auto- and cross-serial covariances on momentum profits under the Fama-French five-factor model

Section 4.1 shows that the covariance structure of factor returns can induce momentum into the
cross section of stocks through autocovariances and cross-serial correlations. Because factor returns
are positively autocorrelated, the autocovariance component positively adds to the momentum
profits. The effect of the cross-serial correlations, however, depends on the cross-serial covariance
in factor returns and the covariance in stocks’ factor loadings. This channel adds to the momentum
profits only if the cross-serial correlations of returns and the covariances of betas have the same
signs. In this Appendix we show that, because of the restrictiveness of this condition, it is unlikely
to matter in the data. We use the Fama-French five-factor model as an illustration.
Our approach requires estimating factor betas to measure the cross-sectional variances in factor
betas and covariances between betas of different factors. For each stock at time t, we estimate
factor betas by estimating rolling five-factor model regressions using one year of daily return data:

SMB
RMW
HML
CMA
MKTRF
SMB + s .
RMW + βs,d
HML + βs,d
CMA + βs,d
MKTRF + βs,d
rs,d = αs + βs,d

(A-1)

We winsorize the beta estimates every month at the 1st and 99th percentiles to mitigate the effect
of outliers. The top panel of Table A3 shows the autocovariances (elements on the diagonal of the
matrix, boldfaced) and cross-serial covariances in factor returns. Most factors exhibit positive leadlag relationship with other factors with the exception of the market. High returns on the market
between t − 12 and t − 1 signal lower returns on the other factors at time t. Similarly, high returns
on the size (SMB), profitability (RMW), and investment (CMA) factors are associated with lower
future returns on the market.
The lower panel of Table A3 reports the average cross-sectional variances and covariance of

betas that are estimated each month. With the exception of the investment and value factors,
whose betas tend to be negatively correlated, the pairwise covariances are positive. We use these
estimates to measure the contributions of the auto-covariances and cross-serial covariances to the
profitability of the individual stock momentum strategy. Multiplying each cross-covariance of the
top panel by its corresponding covariance in the lower panel, and summing across all factor pairs,
gives a small and negative estimate of −0.13% for the net effect of the cross-covariance component.
In contrast, the contribution of the autocovariance term is significantly higher. Under the fivefactor model, it is the autocorrelation in factor returns that turns into momentum in the cross

Momentum crash and booms probit regressions

Figure 4 suggests that individual stock momentum is likely to crash when the autocorrelations in
factor returns turn negative. In this Appendix we measure the strength of this association. In
Table A5 we reports estimates of probit models in which the dependent variable (Crash) is an
48

indicator variable that takes the value of one when UMD’s return is below the 10th percentile of
its distribution and zero otherwise:


Pr Crasht = 1| ρauto,t = F (α + βρauto,t ),

(A-2)

where ρauto,t is the factor autocorrelation computed using equation (11), Pr(·|·) denotes the conditional probability, and F (·) is the cumulative normal distribution. We also report estimates of
another set of probit models in the dependent variable (Boom) takes the value of one if UMD’s
return is above the 90th percentile of its distribution and zero otherwise. Because the probit model
is nonlinear, we report the marginal effects implied by the slope estimates. In addition to the 20
non-momentum factors listed in Table 1, we also add the market factor to the list of factors due to
its role in generating momentum crashes (Daniel and Moskowitz, 2016).
Table A5 shows that the conditional probability of a momentum crash decreases in the autocorrelation across most factors. For the 11 factors with statistically significant estimates, a one-unit
increase in the autocorrelation decreases the probability of a momentum crash between −1.1%
(global investment) and −7.1% (liquidity). The first row measures the effect of the aggregate autocorrelation index on the likelihood of a crash. A one-unit increase in the index associates with
a 15% lower probability of a crash (z-value = −6.78). This estimate exceeds that of all individual factors and it supports the view that equity momentum emerges as the summation of factor
autocorrelations.
Just as momentum underperforms when factor returns are negatively autocorrelated, momentum returns are higher when the autocorrelations intensify. The boom estimates are similar to the
crash estimates but with the opposite signs. A one-unit increase in the aggregate autocorrelation
index increases the probability of a “boom” by 15%. The aggregate autocorrelation index there-

Table A5: Factor autocorrelation and momentum crashes and booms
This table reports estimates for probit regressions that measure the relationship between momentum
crashes and booms and factor autocorrelations. Momentum crash is an indicator variable that takes
the value of one if UMD’s return is below the 10th percentile of its distribution and zero otherwise;
momentum boom takes the value of one if UMD’s return is above the 90th percentile. Each row,
except for the first one, measures the association between momentum crashes and booms and the
autocorrelation in one of the factors. The independent variable in these regressions is the factor’s
autocorrelation in month t computed from equation (11). The independent variable on the first
row is the aggregate factor autocorrelation index, which is the cross-sectional average of factors’
autocorrelations. This table reports the marginal effects associated with the autocorrelations, that
is, the effect of a one-unit increase in the autocorrelation on the likelihood of a crash or a boom in
percentage points, the z-values associated with the slope estimates, and McFadden’s pseudo R2 s.

Time-series regressions of factor returns on sentiment and lagged returns

We regress each factor’s returns on lagged sentiment and past returns:

rt = α + βs St−1 + βm r−t + t ,

(A-3)

where St−1 is the sentiment index at time t−1 and r−t is the average factor return from month t−12
to t − 1. We also estimate alternative regressions which replace both the investor sentiment and
prior average returns with indicator variables. The investor sentiment indicator variables takes the
value of one when the sentiment is above the sample median and zero otherwise; the prior-return
indicator variables takes the value of one when the prior return is positive and zero otherwise. This
definition of the sentiment indicator variable is the same as that in Stambaugh et al. (2012).
Table A6 confirms the findings of Stambaugh et al. (2012). Anomaly returns are higher following
periods of high sentiment, and often significantly so. The only statistically significant exception
is the size factor. The first row reports the results from a pooled regression which clusters the
standard errors by month. Both sentiment and momentum are statistically significant. The righthand side of Panel A shows that these conclusions do not change when we replace the explanatory
variables with indicator variables. In the pooled regression, high sentiment and positive factor
return both signal higher future factor returns. High sentiment increases factor returns by 27 basis
points (t-value = 2.75); positive factor return by 49 basis points (t-value = 4.19). Both sentiment
and prior factor returns therefore independently predict factor returns.

51

Table A6: Time-series regressions of factor returns on sentiment and prior factor returns
We report coefficient estimates from predictive time-series regressions in which the dependent variable is the return on a factor and the explanatory variables are the lagged investor sentiment and
the factor’s prior one-year return: rt = α + βs St−1 + βm rt−12,t−1 + t . The second set of columns
shows the results from regressions that replace the sentiment and return variables with indicator
variables: rt = a + bs 1St−1 >median + bm 1r−t >0 + t . The sentiment indicator variable takes the value
of one when investor sentiment is above the sample median and zero otherwise. The return indicator variable takes the value of one when the factor’s average return over the prior year is positive
and zero otherwise. The pooled regression on the first line cluster standard errors by month.
