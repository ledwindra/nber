ABSTRACT
Although supplemental saving plans can be an important part of an individual's financial security
in retirement, contribution rates remain low, particularly among those with lower salaries and less
education. We report findings from a field experiment that distributed an informational nudge
containing information on key aspects of the employer-provided supplemental saving plans of
older public employees in North Carolina. Among workers participating in a supplemental plan,
individuals who received an informational nudge increased their contributions in the months
following the intervention relative to the control group. Moreover, those that received the nudge
reported in a subsequent survey that they were more likely to have developed a retirement plan
and report more confidence in their retirement preparedness. In contrast, individuals who were
not enrolled in a retirement saving plan were not moved to begin contributing to a supplemental
plan.

Nudging Retirement Savings: A Field Experiment on Supplemental Plans
I.

Introduction
Ensuring adequate retirement income is of foremost policy importance. But there is a

tradeoff between financial security during an individual’s working years and financial security in
retirement. We present results from a field experiment that was designed to spur individuals to
reassess their retirement savings decisions. We interpret the results of this informational nudge
in the context of the tradeoff between saving for the short/medium-term (for consumption during
working years) and saving for the long-term (to provide income for the retirement years).
Our intervention targeted public sector workers in North Carolina who were more than 50
years old. By focusing on older workers, we examine the role of informational nudges in the
context of individuals who may be hard to encourage to increase their rate of savings. We expect
that older workers are hard-to-nudge because their tenure in the workforce has given them
numerous opportunities to formulate and implement retirement plans or to indicate their
unwillingness to engage in saving additional funds for retirement. Workers who have for years
declined the opportunity to enroll in a retirement saving plan may be expressing their preference
for current consumption over saving for additional consumption in retirement. In fact, Biggs
(2017) concludes that if low income, working-age households reduce their take-home pay in
order to contribute to retirement plans their standards of living in retirement may exceed that
while they are working. Thus, it may not be surprising that public employees with lower
earnings have optimally chosen not to contribute to a supplemental retirement saving plan.
These workers are included in Social Security and are covered by a defined benefit pension. Our
study explores this concern directly by asking whether individuals have engaged in retirement
planning and whether they feel they have accumulated sufficient retirement wealth.

1

Alternatively, older workers may be resistant to changing saving behavior because the
framing of policy interventions typically emphasizes compound interest as the key benefit of
saving for retirement. This incentive is less important for older workers who have fewer
remaining years to build savings (Clark, et al., 2014). Although compounding is an important
benefit of retirement plans, older workers still experience several benefits from savings in
employer-provided retirement plans. We designed our informational nudge to emphasize the
benefits that older workers experience from increased retirement savings. For example,
individuals may find that primary employer-provided defined benefit pension plans are
inadequate to insure against longevity risk. Cost-of-living adjustments (COLA’s) are typically
not guaranteed and usually are less than the annual increase in the Consumer Price Index leaving
individuals susceptible to inflation risk in retirement.
Further, individuals may have not anticipated cost of medical expenditures in late life and
thus find that income from Social Security and employer pensions is insufficient to achieve the
desired level of consumption or to cover an unanticipated health or income shock at older ages.
Thus, supplemental retirement saving plans can help workers obtain sufficient wealth prior to
retirement and insure against unexpected health or income shocks.1 Further, contributions can be
made pre-tax and grow tax-deferred until withdrawal. We present results from a field experiment
that was designed specifically to spur older workers to reassess their retirement savings decisions
highlighting these alternative motivations for participation in retirement saving plans.

1

Throughout this discussion, the term “supplemental retirement saving plans” refers to employer-

provided retirement saving plans such as 401(k) and 457 plans that are based on payroll deductions as
contributions to the plans.

2

Voluntary saving plans may be underutilized due to insufficient understanding of these
plans, behavioral biases that lead to inaction, or a lack of financial literacy. Choi, Laibson, and
Madrian (2004) show the importance of clarity in plan design. Behavioral factors associated
with undersaving include hyperbolic discounting (Laibson, 1997), a lack of self-control (Thaler
and Shefrin, 1981), and procrastination (Choi, Laibson, Madrian, and Metrick, 2003). Further,
the behavior economics literature has stressed the role of framing, which matters for retirement
savings as well. For example, Goldin, Homonoff, and Tucker-Ray (2017) find larger responses
to a nudge that emphasized low rather than high contribution rates. Finally, financial literacy has
been shown to play an important role in saving and other financial decisions and increased
financial literacy has been promoted as a policy priority (Lusardi, 2005; Van Rooij, Lusardi, and
Alessie, 2012; Hastings, Madrian, and Skimmyhorn, 2013; Lusardi and Mitchell, 2014.). On the
other hand, non-participation or participation at low levels could be the result of a wellformulated retirement plan, and individuals may have adequate wealth accumulated through
outside savings vehicles and pension plans.
Our field experiment sent several versions of an informational nudge to randomly
selected groups of older North Carolina state employees. Our experimental design tailored one
set of nudges to workers with positive balances in a supplemental saving plan (participants) and
a different set of nudges to workers without savings in a supplemental plan (non-participants).
Our treatments provided information to older workers with an emphasis on either tax advantages,
longevity risk, personalized risk selection, or liquidity. Among participants, we find a small and
statistically significant impact on retirement savings among treated workers. We also find an
increase in reports of having made a retirement plan and higher confidence in retirement income
sufficiency. Non-participants did not respond to our intervention either in saving or planning

3

behavior. This is consistent with the fact that non-participants who are over age 50 have
consistently decided over many years not to contribute to a retirement saving plan.
Importantly, we also observe some individuals decreasing retirement saving contributions
after receiving the nudge. This suggests an alternative explanation of why older workers are
hard to “nudge” into savings. Hard-to-nudge groups have been treated in the literature as
requiring alternative nudge strategies to affect behavior in ways that achieve policy objectives.
In this case, our hard-to-nudge group of older workers may be responding in ways that are
individually optimal.2 Thus, we interpret the success of the experiment as twofold. First, a small
but significant number of older workers increased retirement savings due to receiving a nudge.
Second, a larger fraction of those receiving a flyer were induced to reassess their retirement
savings and engage in retirement planning. Low cost interventions like these flyers are shown to
be a valid tool to improve retirement income security when targeted to individuals who are
already engaged in the saving process.
II.

Background on Supplemental Saving Plans
This study considers state government employees in North Carolina. North Carolina is a

particularly interesting state to study given its large size and mix of urban and rural population.
All state employees in North Carolina are covered by a standard defined benefit pension plan and
retiree health insurance. State employees in North Carolina also have access to two state-

2

This interpretation follows the argument of Bernheim and Rangel (2005) to interpret the results of policy

interventions without paternalistic prior beliefs on welfare enhancing behavior at the individual level.

4

managed supplemental retirement saving plans: NC 401(k) or NC 457. Both plans are managed
by Prudential and have similar investment options.3
Individuals contribute a fraction of their salary to an account that accumulates without
any tax on investment returns until the time of the withdrawals. Both 401(k) and 457 plans allow
employees to make pre-tax contributions. The North Carolina plans also offer Roth options that
allow employees to contribute after-tax dollars to the plan. At the time of the experiment in
2014, annual dollar limits imposed by the IRS on employee contributions were $17,500 in both
plans, and both plans had the same age 50 and over catch-up provisions that allow older workers
to contribute an additional $5,500 per year. Interestingly, public employees are allowed to
contribute up to the maximum in both plans. Thus, a state government employee over the age 50
could actually contribute up to a total of $46,000 in combined contributions.4
Distributions without tax penalties are allowed at retirement after age 55 in the 401(k),
while the 457 plans allow such distributions at termination of employment at any age. This may
be an important distinction as many public employees retire from their career state jobs in their
early 50s. In-service distributions are allowed prior to age 59½ in 401(k) plans with a 10 percent
tax penalty. In-service distributions are not allowed in 457 plans. Thus, workers who wish to
maintain the ability to access their fund prior to retirement may be more likely to contribute to
401(k) plans. Both plans allow rollovers to other retirement saving plans or IRAs.

3

Clark, Pathak, and Pelletier (2017) and Clark, Hanson, Morrill, and Pathak (2016) explore how plan

differences affect choices between 401(k) and 457 plans.
4

These contribution limits have been increased so in 2017, participants can contribute up to $18,000

annual with catch-up contributions of $6,000 allowed for employees over age 50.

5

Most of the evidence on voluntary retirement saving plans is derived from the analysis of
private sector 401(k) plans. These plans are often the only retirement plan offered by firms, so
they are actually primary rather than supplemental retirement plans. While many of the same
behavioral factors affecting private workers saving decisions in primary 401(k) plans will be
relevant to workers considering participation in supplemental plans, individuals covered by a
defined benefit plan with access to a supplemental plan may have determined that their
retirement savings (pension plus Social Security) to be adequate. Thus, policies advocated for
primary plans, such as automatic enrollment and auto-escalation, are likely not appropriate for
public employees.
III.

Design of the Nudge
The North Carolina Retirement System sent our informational flyers to a randomly

selected group among active state employees ages 50-69 with valid email addresses. Individuals
were first grouped according to pre-treatment participation status in a supplement plan. The
Retirement System selected all workers who had an active account with a balance of more than
$1 and year to date contributions of less than $10,000 to form the current participants sample.
The current non-participants sample consisted of workers with no current account. Details of the
data construction are included below.
A. Current Participants
We developed alternative versions of an informative flyer aimed at increasing
contributions to the supplemental retirement saving plans. The participant group was
randomized into a control group and three treatment groups (Baseline, Longevity, and Tax
Advantage). The control group received no nudge. Figure 1 displays the informational nudges
that were sent to those in the treated participants group. The baseline group received a nudge

6

with general information about the supplemental saving plans, including a direct link to the plan
provider’s website to facilitate activity. The baseline nudge also provided information on catchup provisions, which raise yearly contribution limits for individuals ages 50 and older. Note that
all employees in our sample population qualify for this benefit. Given our focus on older
workers, information about these catch-up provisions was a key part of the design.
[Figure 1]
The longevity and tax advantage group received the baseline nudge plus additional
information that had a specific target. Figure 1 illustrates the additional text within a red box.
The longevity nudge was a negative framing and included information on average life
expectancy when retiring at age 65 and the need to save to offset any future out-of-pocket
medical expenses. The tax advantage nudge was a more positive framing by emphasizing the
tax-advantaged nature of supplement saving plan contributions. The tax advantages of saving for
retirement through supplemental saving plans are frequently discussed among economists and
financial advisors but it is unclear how widely understood this information is for a typical
individual in the population (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2014).
B. Current Non-participants
The non-participant group was randomized into a control group and four treatment
groups (Baseline, Longevity, Liquidity, and GoalMaker). Figure 2 displays the informational
nudges that were sent to treated non-participants. As with participants, the control group
received no nudge. The baseline group received a flyer including a direct link to open an
account and emphasizing catch-up provisions. Similar to the participants group, the longevity
group received the baseline nudge with additional information targeted toward extended time
spent in retirement. The liquidity group received the baseline nudge with additional information

7

emphasizing the availability of supplemental plan withdrawals for older workers prior to
retirement.5 Finally, the GoalMaker group received the baseline nudge with additional
information about the ease of personalizing investment decisions through a risk tailoring feature
known as GoalMaker.6 GoalMaker allows individuals to select a specific risk profile for their
investments by answering a series of straightforward questions, thereby avoiding choice overload
or a reliance on financial sophistication. GoalMaker automatically alters the investments in the
saving account to fit the risk profile selected by the participant. The objective of this nudge was
to reduce the concerns of individuals who doubted their ability to manage investment accounts
about participating in a retirement saving plan.
[Figure 2]
C. Data
The North Carolina Retirement System developed a sample of 14,710 active workers at
NC state agencies, ages 50-69 as of November 2014.7 The sample includes individuals enrolled
in the Teachers’ and State Employees’ Retirement System (TSERS) who have never previously
retired or claimed long-term disability and have an email address available on record.8 The

Note that only non-participants received a nudge emphasizing the ability to take in-service distributions

out of concern that we might nudge withdrawals from those who already have supplemental retirement
savings in the state-managed plans.

More information about the data is provided in Appendix A.

8

Teachers and other school personnel are excluded from this study because all North Carolina school

districts also offer employees the opportunity to invest in 403(b) plans and in some cases, locally-

8

sample excludes individuals with an active account with an account balance below $1 or year to
date contributions exceeding $10,000. In addition, the sample excludes individuals with
outstanding loans, suspended accounts, or those who received employer contributions in 2014.
The Retirement System provided us with administrative data on all sample individuals at
three points: October 31, 2014, December 31, 2014, and August 15, 2015. The administrative
records allow us to construct data on whether the individual has an active account and, if so,
what type of plan, balance in each plan, and year-to-date contributions in each plan.9 We
supplement these cross-sectional data with longitudinal data from October 1 – December 31,
2014, which includes observations on account openings and contribution changes (increases or
decreases) and the exact date the change was made. For those who made a contribution change,
we observe the original contribution level and the new contribution level.10 Finally, for all
individuals, we observe years of service, salary, state agency of employment, age, and gender.
We also utilize survey data in Section VII, described in more detail in Appendix C.
Table 1 presents characteristics of employees in our full data and then separately for
current participants and current non-participants. Column (4) presents p-values of the
differences between participants and non-participants. Throughout, we use nonparametric tests

managed 457 plans. We do not have access to the contributions and account balances in any locallymanaged plans that are widely used by teachers. Thus, these individuals were deleted from the sample.
9

Appendix A provides detail on how these terms are defined in our data.

10

Plan participants may elect to make contributions of a given amount or at a given rate (percent of

salary). Using salary information, we convert rate contributions to amounts. There are a small number of
individuals with missing salary information (as shown in Table 1). For these individuals, we convert rate
contributions to amounts using mean salary but the results are robust to dropping all individuals with
missing salary or all individuals with missing salary who made contribution changes.

9

for consistency with the experimental economics literature; discrete variables are tested using a
difference in proportions test, while continuous variables are tested using a difference in medians
test. In all analysis, we summarize continuous outcomes using medians. About 44 percent of the
sample is male, and men are no more likely to be participants than women. Even though the
sample is restricted to those ages 50 and older, the median age of non-participants is about one
year older. More importantly, we impute age at hire for individuals and observe that the median
age of non-participants, 45 years old, is about 5 years older than participants. This suggests that
non-participants may be more likely to have worked prior to state agency employment and may
have outside retirement savings (e.g., a 401(k) plan from prior employer). We do not have data
on individuals’ access to or participation in supplemental plans outside of the state-managed
supplemental retirement saving plans.
We observe that non-participants have a lower median salary than participants, which is
consistent with those with lower earnings having higher replacement rates from Social Security
thus indicating a lower need for additional retirement savings (Biggs 2017). Individuals with
lower annual earnings also may have less ability to save given demands for current consumption.
We also observe that the median years of service for participants is 18 relative to only 12 for
non-participants. Given the similarity in median age, the difference in years of service between
the groups is likely due to age at hire (as noted above).
[Table 1]

10

D. Validity of Experimental Design
The retirement system sent email nudges containing information on supplemental saving
plans over a three day period: Wednesday, November 12 through Friday, November 14, 2014.11
To demonstrate the validity of randomization, Table 2 presents summary statistics for individuals
in the treatment and control groups separately for participants and non-participants. In Panel A,
the treatment-to-control demographic differences are statistically insignificantly different for
both participants and non-participants. Panel B shows various measures of savings behavior for
participants. Individuals in the treatment group are three percentage points more (less) likely to
be participating in both a 401(k) plan and a 457 plan (a 401(k) plan only); a similar proportion of
treated and untreated individuals participate in 457 plans. While the split among the treatment
and control groups across plan types is statistical significantly different, we do not distinguish
between plan types in the regression analysis that follows.
[Table 2]
More importantly, the pre-treatment plan balance of the treatment and control groups are
very similar. The median total balance is $16,363 for the treatment group and $16,368 for the
control group. For year-to-date contributions, the median contribution through October 31, 2014
is $1,000 for both the treatment and controls groups. Despite having the same medians, the pvalue from a medians test suggests a statistically significant difference between year-to-date

11

The flyers were distributed by the Retirement Systems Division (RSD) at the North Carolina

Department of State Treasurer (DST). To avoid an excessive increase in call volume in the supplemental
plan administrator’s call center, the distribution of flyers was staggered over the course of three days
(November 12, 13, and 14, 2014). To reduce the load on email servers, two waves were distributed each
day (8:00 AM and 8:05 AM).

11

contributions (i.e., slightly more treated individuals have an above-median year-to-date
contribution relative to control individuals).12 Given that these differences are small (again, the
medians are exactly the same), we conclude that this is not a large concern.
As a further demonstration of pre-nudge similarity between the treatment and control
groups, we graphically present daily rates of contribution increases for those with a non-zero
balance as of October 31, 2014 (i.e., the participant sample). A local polynomial regression
fitted curve is overlaid.13 Figure 3 illustrates these values for the month of October, which is
prior to the nudge but also includes the open enrollment period. In Figure 3, we see treatment
and control groups have similar patterns of contributions.
[Figure 3]
The daily rates of contribution increases are small, where the average day in October saw
0.2 percent (i.e., two-tenths of one percent) of the sample increase their contribution. It is not
surprising that, on a randomly chosen day of the year, few individuals log into their supplemental
saving plan provider’s website to change their contribution. Further, note that October is the
annual enrollment month for public sector employees to make elections for the State Health Plan

12

A two-sample medians test asks whether one group has a statistically dissimilar proportion of

individuals for whom the variable takes a value above the median. When there is a mass point in the
distribution at the median, “median ties” can confuse the interpretation of the test. For the treatment
group, 48.51% of Total YTD Contributions are below $1,000, 7.83% are equal to $1,000, and 43.66% are
above $1,000. For the control group, the percentages are 49.13%, 9.87%, and 41.00%. The distribution
of YTD Contributions is shown in Appendix Figure B1. This figure is consistent with the validity of
randomization for this variable.
13

A local polynomial regression is a nonparametric technique for flexibly modeling associations between

two variables. Figures 3 and 4 use a bandwidth of seven days. Beyond the daily rates of contribution
increases in Figures 3 and 4, Appendix Figures B2 and B3 present daily rates of contribution changes.

12

in North Carolina. We were aware of the focal nature of October for a number of employeebenefit-related decisions, including obviously the health plan but also decisions regarding
retirement savings. The timing of our nudge reflected a desire to avoid the annual enrollment
month, worrying that the increased level of underlying activity in October would make precise
estimates more difficult to obtain. The fitted curves for both the treatment and control groups
present an intuitive pattern: slightly more activity at the beginning of October (when open
enrollment begins) and at the end of October (just before open enrollment closes), relative to the
middle of the month. There are no apparent treatment-control differences in the month prior to
the nudge.
Figure 4 presents these daily rates for the month of November. The vertical line is the
first date that a flyer was sent. Prior to November 12, we again see that treatment and control
experienced similar contribution rate increases. We also observe that the average daily rate of
contribution increases between November 1 and November 9 was around 0.1 percent. It is
important to keep this scale in mind when interpreting the treatment effects that are discussed in
the next section. The effect of the receiving the nudge is clearly shown to the right of the vertical
lines in Figure 4. Contribution increases are strikingly higher in the treatment group as
compared to the control group and the effect is concentrated just after the nudge was sent.
[Figure 4]
Figure 3 and the left panel of Figure 4, along with results in Table 2, demonstrate the
validity of the experiment design and the similarity of the treatment and control groups. We
proceed with analysis of treatment relative to control using post-nudge data only, consistent with
our setting of a randomized controlled trial.

13

IV.

Treatment Effects of the Informational Intervention

A. Aggregate Results for Participants
The right panel of Figure 4 previews the main result that, among participants, the nudge
was associated with more contribution increases in the treatment group relative to the control
group. To get a better sense of magnitudes, Table 3 shows the rates of contribution increases and
decreases. Here, the post-nudge period is defined as following the receipt of the email through
December 31, 2014.14 In all treatment columns, we test statistical significance relative to the
control group using a difference in proportions test.
[Table 3]
The treatment group increases its contributions at a rate of 2.8 percent, cumulatively over
the late November/December period. This is statistically significantly higher than the 1.8
percent rate for the control group, for a treatment effect of 1.0 percentage points. The treatment
group also decreases contributions at a higher rate, 1.1 percent versus 1.0 percent, but this
difference is not statistically significant. Interpreting these results requires additional
information about individual’s preferences and financial state. If we adopt a presumption that
individuals are undersaving, then the appropriate metric for the effect of the nudge is the rate of
contribution increases minus the rate of contribution decreases. If we instead rely on revealed
preferences, the appropriate metric is the rate of contribution changes.

14

That is, the activity of an individual in the treatment group is included in this analysis beginning of the

day she received the nudge (either November 12, 13, or 14). For the control group, the control period
starts November 12, which is conservative in the sense that any activity in the control group during any
nudge send day is included for the control group, potentially increasing the control rate that we are netting
out.

14

Our approach to the ambiguity in interpreting the results of policy interventions is to
present a full picture of individuals’ actions following the nudge. Table 3 thus shows the rate at
which individuals made any change to their contribution rate.15 This includes all activity
including changes that left one’s contribution rate identical to the pre-treatment rate (e.g., rate
increase of $1,000, followed by a rate decrease of $1,000). Treated individuals were statistically
significantly more like to make net contribution changes at a rate of 3.8 versus 2.8 percent.
Similarly, 3.9 percent of treated individuals made any change in contribution relative to only 2.8
percent of those in the control group.
Next, we exploit the detailed nature of our data by following individuals through August
15, 2015, which is nine months after the nudge. We refer to this time period as medium-term
actions. The outcomes of interest are similar as before, except that we can only observe net
contribution changes because the cross-sectional data we have from August 15, 2015 do not
allow us to construct a panel of contribution changes. Not surprisingly, we observe much higher
rates of activity overall in the medium-term. The control group increased contributions at a rate
of 15.5 percent and made net changes at a rate of 22.7 percent. For treated individuals across all
treatments, all rates are higher. The treatment effects are 2.1 percentage points for contribution
increases and 3.6 percentage points for contribution changes. Each of these effects is statistically
significant. The outcome of the nudge is meaningful for participants, irrespective of our
perspective for the appropriate metric for interpreting the results (presumption of undersaving or
revealed preferences).

15

It should be noted that we do not observe one-time contributions, so all results will understate the total

behavioral response to the nudge.

15

Finally, Panel B of Table 3 presents the effect on balances or contribution changes in
dollars, conditional on making a medium-term net contribution change. Conditional on making a
change, balance and contribution changes are similar across treatment and control groups. Thus,
our nudge moved some participants into changing their contribution rates but did not lead to
larger contribution levels among those who made changes.
The means reported in Table 3 suggest that the tax advantage treatment led to more
contribution increases than either the baseline or longevity treatments. As we will show below,
the differences between treatments are not statistically significant in most cases. Still, we
observe that the longevity treatment was associated with the smallest movements in contribution
increases, decreases, or changes, relative to the other treatments. The tax advantage treatment
was designed to emphasize the tax-favored nature of contributions to supplemental saving plans.
This is one of the typical framings for retirement savings interventions. The longevity treatment
was designed with our sample of older workers specifically in mind, where we highlighted the
life expectancy of the typical retiree in our sample. The results in Table 3 suggest that, in our
sample, a negative framing (reminding individuals that they may grow very old and sick) did not
outperform a positive framing (reminding individuals that contributions lower their tax bill).
We return to this discussion in Table 5 below.
We conclude that the nudge prompted some current participants to increase the amount
they contribute to their supplemental saving plan and others to change their contributions in the
opposite direction. In the discussion that follows, we continue to present results for both
contribution increases and contribution changes to allow an understanding of the effect of this
nudge without relying on a presumption that individuals are undersaving.

16

B. Regression Results
In a randomized controlled trial, we expect that including covariates will not meaningfully
affect the treatment effect found in the pairwise comparisons of the previous section. This is
exactly what we see in Table 4. Here, we provide estimates of average marginal effects from a
Probit model regression with four outcomes as defined in Table 3 above: short-term increase,
short-term any change, medium-term increase, and medium-term net change. As found in Table 3,
when no controls are included the effect of the treatment is a one percentage point increase in the
probability of increasing contributions. Column (2) includes a host of individual controls available
in the administrative records.16 Overall, men are more likely to increase contributions, as are those
with lower salaries and higher initial balances. As expected, the estimated effect of the nudge is
unchanged by adding these control variables. Column (3) again shows an identical point estimate.
[Table 4]
Next, Table 4 presents results for an alternative dependent variable: making any change in
contributions after the nudge and before December 31, 2014. The estimated impact of the nudge
is 1.2 percentage points. Adding controls again yields similar estimates. Receiving the nudge is
associated with a 1.1 percentage point higher probability of making any change to supplemental
retirement saving plan contributions. Columns (5)-(6) indicate that receiving the nudge led to a 2
percentage point higher probability of increasing contributions over the subsequent nine months.

Agency fixed effects are grouped into five categories. We group the smaller agencies into two

categories: agencies as those with fewer than 100 employees in our sample and those with between 100
and 1,000 employees in our sample. The three largest agencies have separate controls: Department of
Health and Human Services, Department of Public Safety, and Highway Administration. Relative to the
small agencies, employees at Health and Human Services and the Highway Administration were about 1
percentage points less likely to have a net increase in contributions.

17

This is off of a mean contribution rate of 17 percent, so represents about 12 percent of the mean.
Similarly, when considering whether the employee made a net change in contributions (either an
increase or decrease), we see that the nudge increased the likelihood of making a net change by
3.6 percentage points off of a sample mean of 25.4 percent (about 14 percent of the mean). Thus,
even among a group where contribution changes are relatively rare, our informational nudge did
change behavior by an economically and statistically significant amount.
C. Heterogeneity in Treatment Effects
Table 5 considers heterogeneity in the effects of the treatment for short-term and mediumterm contribution increases in Panels A and B, respectively. Results for any change or net change
are similar and are presented in Appendix B. The regression specifications are parallel to Table 4,
Columns (2) and (6), respectively, but include interaction terms with the treatment variable. In
Panel A, Column (1), the differential effect of receiving the longevity or tax advantage treatment
relative to the baseline treatment is not statistically significant. Thus, we find that a more detailed
nudge is no more influential than the baseline in increasing contributions. Interestingly, in Panel
B, we observe that the baseline treatment and longevity treatment did not result in a statistically
significant probability of increasing contributions and the full result in the medium-term is
concentrated among those receiving the tax treatment.17
[Table 5]
Next, we consider whether the nudge was disproportionally effective for different
demographic groups. In Column (2) of Table 5, we see that the effect of the nudge was

17

Separately comparing each of the more detailed treatments to the control group, we find statistically

significant treatment effects with contribution increases for both (longevity: estimate = 0.6 percentage
points, p-value = 0.05; tax advantage: estimate = 1.3 percentage points, p-value = 0.01).

18

concentrated among men with no statistically significant difference between treatment and control
for women. We find no statistically significant differences by salary level or years until eligible
for retirement benefits. The treatment effect is concentrated among those with below median age
at hire. This is consistent with lower overall participation rates among those with older ages at
hire shown in Table 1. One interpretation is that older-at-hire individuals are entering public sector
employment after other employment spells, possibly coming from the private sector. Those with
fewer years of service were also more likely to respond to the treatment, although that difference
is only statistically significant in the medium-term.
Finally, in Columns (7) and (8) of Table 5, we see that the short-term treatment effect is
only statistically significant for those with above median initial balance in the plan. The median
initial plan balance is $16,363. However, the effect is not concentrated on those with the very
highest initial plan balances and the difference is not statistically significant in the medium-term.
The 90th percentile of initial plan balance is $97,676. Those with initially low balances were not
induced to save more by the nudge. This is consistent with the results discussed next for those
who had no supplemental retirement savings through the state-managed plans.
V.

Non-participants
Table 6 presents the results for non-participants. These are individuals who have had

numerous opportunities to begin saving additional funds in their state-government employersponsored supplemental saving plans. As emphasized in the introduction, our non-participant
sample may consistent of individuals with a preference for current consumption over saving for
additional consumption in retirement. These individuals are covered by both a defined-benefit
pension plans and Social Security. Further, some individuals in our non-participant sample may

19

in fact be participating in a supplemental saving plan, perhaps through a previous employer or a
spouse’s employer.
[Table 6]
For non-participants, we show the results in terms of the same outcomes as before.
However, with non-participants, increasing their contribution either requires that they restart
contributing to an inactive plan or open a new plan and begin contribution. The effect sizes in
every cell in Table 6 are quite small, with 0.6 percent (i.e., six-tenths of one percent) of the
control group increasing their contribution from the nudge until the end of 2014. This is
statistically insignificantly larger than the rate for the treatment group. The same pattern holds
for all outcomes in Table 6: small rates of activity for non-participants with no evidence of a
positive treatment effect.
Concerning specific treatment types, the longevity treatment repeats the treatment used
for participants. As before, the longevity treatment effect is slightly smaller than the baseline
treatment effect but the difference is not statistically significant. The liquidity treatment
emphasized the availability of supplemental plan withdrawals for older workers prior to
retirement. The GoalMaker treatment emphasized the ease of personalizing investment decisions
through a risk tailoring feature known as GoalMaker, as described in Section III.B. The liquidity
and GoalMaker treatment effects are smaller than the baseline treatment effect but the
differences are very small. For all outcomes, we conclude that the rates of activity in the nonparticipant group are so small that we cannot draw any conclusions beyond the fact that our
nudge did not significantly affect saving behavior for non-participants.
VI.

Longer-term outcomes

20

Our final analysis uses survey responses from a subset of our nudge sample. More detail
on these data is provided in Appendix C. This field experiment was part of a larger project that
included a series of surveys of North Carolina public sector workers. We now link individuals in
our nudge sample to respondents to these surveys. It is important to emphasize that the flyers in
our nudge were sent by the NC Retirement Systems Division, while the survey invitations were
sent by us from a university email address. As a result, from the perspective of survey
respondents, the overlap between the nudge and the surveys was likely to be opaque. This
implies that survey respondents are unlikely to have been thinking specifically about the flyer
received about six months earlier as they responded to our survey. Consistent with this claim,
we find that retirement rates and survey response rates are statistically insignificantly different
for individuals in the nudge sample between the treatment and control group. Results are
presented in Appendix C. For this portion of the analysis, we restrict our attention to the
individuals that were actively employed as of April 2016, who responded to our survey, and who
were in either the treatment or control group for the experiment. The sample sizes are 318
respondents for the participant group and 341 respondents for the non-participant group. Recall
that participation status is determined by the pre-treatment status and that different flyers were
sent to each group.
Table 7 presents a series of regression analyses for individuals’ survey responses among
those who were included in our 2014 nudge sample and responded to our survey, which was
fielded from May 2016 to July 2016. Columns (1) and (2) include individuals in our nudge
participant sample, while Columns (3) and (4) include individuals in our nudge non-participant
sample. First, we replicate the analysis from Table 4, Columns (5) – (8) on medium-term

21

outcomes looking only at this smaller sample. Here, we do not have power to detect any
treatment effect on contribution increases.
[Table 7]
Next, in Table 7, Panel C, we consider whether an individual reports having a retirement
plan.18 The statements in Panels D and E are measures of perceived retirement readiness. Panel
D presents results where the dependent variable is an indicator for agreeing with the statement: I
believe I will have enough money to live comfortably throughout retirement. Similarly, Panel E
presents estimates for agreeing with the statement: I believe I am saving the right amount for
retirement. Full text of the question wording is presented in Appendix C. We find that having
received an informational flyer on supplemental plans in 2014 is associated with large increases
in retirement planning and perceived retirement readiness, as self-reported in 2016.
Unincentivized survey responses can be criticized relative to objectively measured outcomes.
But this self-reported information provides useful insights into how individuals perceive their
financial situation and as such, complements the outcomes that are observed in the administrative
data.
Columns (1) and (3) show the mean differences among treated and control individuals,
while Columns (2) and (4) add the same individual-level controls as measured in the
administrative data. For participants, individuals in the nudge treatment group report having a
retirement plan at a rate that is around 12 percentage points higher than the rate for those in the
nudge control group. When controls are added, the treatment effect falls to 10.5 percentage
points, which remains statistically significant. The two measures of perceived retirement

retirement plan, see Clark, et al. (2017).

22

readiness provide effect sizes that are relatively similar but the standard errors are quite large.
Treated individual are 11.3 percentage points more likely to report expecting to have enough
money for retirement but the standard error of the difference is 7.8 percentage points. Treated
individuals are 8.6 percentage points more likely to report that they are saving the right amount
for retirement (standard error of 5.3 percentage points). We interpret this as suggestive evidence
that the nudge led to increases in retirement planning and perceived confidence in retirement
readiness. But given the small sample size and the associated noise in our estimates, we cannot
definitively conclude that the nudge had long-term positive effects.
For non-participants, there is no evidence that the nudge led individuals to change their
saving or planning behavior along any dimension. For non-participants, individuals in the
treatment group are 6.5 less likely to report having a retirement plan, 2.8 percentage points more
likely to report confidence in retirement savings, and 1.1 percentage points more likely to report
confidence in retirement savings. Each of these coefficients is smaller than its associated
standard error. Thus, the nudge also had no effect on planning or perceived retirement readiness
for those that were not participating in the NC 401(k) or NC 457 plan prior to the nudge.
VII.

Conclusion

Policy interventions aimed at encouraging retirement saving typically emphasize the
importance of compounding. This framing may be discouraging to workers late in their career
who have fewer working years for account balances to meaningfully benefit from compounding.
However, there are several advantages to retirement saving that benefit older workers.
Retirement savings are more liquid for older workers because in-service withdrawals are allowed
for workers over age 59 ½ from 401(k) plans. Further, catch-up provisions allow older workers,
many who are on the verge of retirement, to save additional funds above the regular IRS

23

maximum contribution limits. Thus, while older workers may be harder to encourage to save,
they have several reasons to take advantage of supplemental retirement saving plans.
For workers covered by a primary defined benefit pension plan and Social Security, an
individual’s retirement income may be adequate without supplemental savings. Further, workers
hired at older ages may have other sources of retirement savings and thus may elect not to
participate in a new employer’s sponsored plan. In total, interventions that target supplemental
saving plan participation should keep in mind the tradeoff between financial security in
retirement and financial security during working years. We interpret the results of our policy
intervention while trying to avoid paternalistic presumptions of welfare enhancing behavior at
the individual level (Bernheim and Rangel, 2005).
In this study, we sent an informational nudge to a randomly selected subset of older state
government employees in North Carolina. The group receiving the flyers was about 2
percentage points more likely to increase contributions in the 9 months following the receipt of
the flyer than the control group who received no flyer, representing about 12 percent of the
sample mean. We also find that some individuals reassessed their retirement savings and chose
to decrease contributions. When considering net changes, we find that the treatment led to a 3.6
percentage point higher probability of making a net change within 9 months relative to the
control group (about 14 percent relative to the sample mean of 25.4 percent).
We take advantage of the extensive nature of our data by linking individuals in our nudge
sample to a detailed survey that was conducted nearly two years later. For individuals in the
nudge sample who subsequently responded to our survey, we find additional evidence that the
nudge affected behavior. Among those who were already participating in a state-managed
retirement saving plan prior to the nudge, receiving a flyer increased the probability of having

24

made a retirement plan and increased self-reported confidence in retirement income security.
These results suggest that our intervention led individuals to reassess their retirement savings
decisions. While a low cost informational nudge might not cause large fractions of older
workers to substantially increase their contribution rates to supplemental plans, such
interventions may encourage retirement planning. This represents an important dimension along
which to measure the success of retirement savings inventions.

Appendix A: Data Appendix
The data used in this paper were gathered as part of a larger project, “Challenges to
Retirement Readiness in the North Carolina Public Sector Workforce,” funded by Sloan
Foundation Grant Number 2013-10-20. For more information about the full project, please see
the website: http://go.ncsu.edu/publicsectorretirement. Table A1 presents the timeline of the
nudge data releases and survey. For this study, the Retirement System provided us with data on
14,710 active workers. All active workers with an email address ages 50 to 69 were eligible for
the nudge sample. The sample excludes individuals with year to date contributions exceeding
$10,000 and those with account balances less than $1. RSD sent 6,629 and 8,081 informational
flyers to the participant and non-participant sample, respectively, and provided us with the
contribution data.
Definitions of key variables are presented in Table A2. Of note, there are several types of
service that could be important in our analysis. First, there is membership service, which should
approximate the actual tenure of the employee minus any transferred or withdrawn service. We
use membership service for our measure of job tenure. However, to be eligible for retirement
benefits, individuals may also have purchased non-contributory (e.g., sick leave and vacation
time) service. These latter types of service are included in our calculation of eligibility for
retirement benefits. Because most non-contributory service is only reported upon retirement, we
include in these calculations an additional 0.71 years of non-contributory service, which is the
mean for the entire population. Years until eligible for retirement are the minimum number of
years before an employee can qualify for early or normal retirement when considering all the
combinations of age at survey 1 and years of service by which an individual can qualify. If the
number of years is less than or equal to zero, the individual already qualifies for retirement.

Appendix C: Survey Data
As part of the larger project described in Appendix A, we fielded a survey to a subset of
all state and local government employees in North Carolina. Because our data include individual
identification numbers, we are able to observe survey responses for some of our nudge
participants. Appendix Table C1 confirms that receipt of the nudge did not alter the probability
of retiring or the probability of responding to the survey. This is shown separately for the
participant and non-participant group, although results are similarly insignificant when the two
samples are pooled. Full information on the survey instrument and further information about the
full project is available at: http://go.ncsu.edu/publicsectorretirement. The key dependent
variables used in Table 7 are defined as follows.
Made a Retirement Plan
Have you already tried to figure out how much money you will need to have saved by the time
you retire so that you can live comfortably in retirement?
○

Yes, I have a retirement plan

○

Yes, I have thought about this, but I do not yet have a plan

○

No, I have not yet thought about this

Those answering “agree” to the following:
Please indicate whether you agree or disagree with each of the following statements.
Disagree

Neither Agree
nor Disagree

I expect to have enough
money to live comfortably
throughout my retirement.
I am saving the right amount
for my retirement.
