FEDERAL RESERVE POLICY, INTEREST RATE VOLATILITY,
AND THE

U.S.

CAPITAL RAISING MECHANISM

Benjamin M. Friedman

lthstract

The evidence presented in this paper leads to three conclusions about
possible effects on the U.S. long-term capital raising mechanism due to the
sharp increase in interest rate volatility that has followed the Federal

Reserve System's adoption of new monetary policy procedures in 1979. First,
the increased volatility has probably led nonfinancial corporations to finance
less of their external funds requirements at long term than they would other-

wise have done. Second, the increased volatility has probably led underwriters
of high grade corporate bonds to increase the spread of a typical new issue's
yield over the prevailing market yield on comparable bonds already outstanding.
Third, there is little firm basis (reported here, anyway) to conclude that
the increased volatility in particular has affected investors' portfolio
behavior in the bond market.

FEDERAL RESERVE POLICY, INTEREST RATE VOLATILITY, AND THE
U.S. CAPITAL RAISING MECEANISM

Benjamin M. Friedlnan*

Harvard University

The object of this paper is to examine in detail, on the basis of
the experience of the U.S. financial markets under the Federal Reserve

Systems new monetary policy procedures announced on October 6, 1979, one
potentially important effect on the nonfinancial economy due to the resulting
increase in interest rate volatility -—

in

particular, the possibility

that increased volatility has impaired the market mechanism for raising
long—term business capital.

Interest rate volatility has been a controversial issue in central

bank policy making for a long time. The ultimate objectives that central
banks pursue almost always refer to nonfinancial aspects of economic activity
and

well-being,

like price stability and

economic growth. In carrying out

policies designed to further these ebject±ves, however, central banks typically

operate exclusively in the financial markets. Their actions therefore affect
interest rates directly and visibly. Whether to use this influence on
interest rates to smooth out short—run fluctuations, or alternatively to
implement actions focused solely on other objectives, and hence leave
interest rates to vary freely with the pulse of market pressures, is the
central question.

In the United States the evolution of the Federal Reserve System's
monetary policy procedures during the last decade, including in particular
the changes announced in October 1979, in effect reversed the attitude

—2—

toward interest rate volatility that had marked the first half-century of

American central banking. When the Congress first established the Federal
Reserve System in 1913, acting in response to a history of financial market
disorders that had periodically depressed business activity, it charged the
new central bank "to provide an elastic currency" to accommodate the economy's

financing needs. That prescription led the Federal Reserve, through most
of its existence, to pursue a policy aimed at stabilizing interest rate

movements. By 1970, however, the drawbacks of focusing monetary policy on
nominal interest rates in an era of rapid and

become apparent, and

based

the

volatile

price inflation had

Federal Reserve shifted to a policy framewOrk

on targeted growth rates for selected monetary aggregates. The imple-

mentation of the monetary targets strategy during the l970s led to some

increase in short-run interest rate volatility. Still, volatility remained
limited, in large part because the Federal Reserve used a short—term
interest rate (the federal funds rate) as the instrument by which it sought
to control the monetary aggregates.

6, 1979, the Federal Reserve publicly reaffirmed its
commitment to the monetary targets framework and also announced a new set
On October

of

operating procedures that, in effect, amounted to using the quantity of

nonborrowed bank reserves as the instrument for controlling the monetary

aggregates. As almost any theory of monetary policy would have predicted,
the short—run volatility of short—term

interest rates increased immediately

and sharply. In addition, the short-run volatility of long-term interest
rates increased as well. The amplitude of interest rate swings during the
one—and—a—half business cycles that have occurred since October 1979 has
been unprecedented in U.S. financial experience. Moreover, the volatility

of interest rates over shorter time horizons —month—to—month, day—to—day,

—3—

and even within the trading day —has also increased dramatically.
From a public policy perspective, however, the question is:

so what?

Why does interest rate volatility matter? Are whatever effects it may have
quantitatively important? Does increased interest rate volatility constitute a
significant drawback, possibly even one that may warrant discarding an other-

wise useful way of conducting monetary policy?
To date economists and other commentators on monetary policy procedures
have provided little serious analysis of the effects of interest rate volatility.
Quantitative studies of the subject before October 1979 typically just tried
to estimate how much interest rate volatility would follow from adopting
one monetary policy framework or another, without going on to say anything

about what would happen as a result of that volatility. Today, after more
than two years of experience under the Federal Reserve's new procedures,
the amount of volatility is readily observable but the question of its
consequences still remains largely unexplored in any systematic way.'
Moreover, even the informal discussions of the increased interest rate volatility since October 1979 have usually focused on its consequences strictly

within the financial markets. In the final analysis, however, purely financial
effects without any nonfinancial counterpart hardly constitute grounds for
choosing one monetary policy framework over another.
On occasions when discussions of interest rate volatility have addressed
the crucial question of effects on the nonfinancial economy, perhaps the
most familiar idea to be raised is the possibility that increased volatility
may impair the market mechanism for raising long—term capital for business

fixed investment. If true, that would be a very important effect indeed.
The U.S. economy's capital markets are unique in their ability to provide

borrowers with long—term funds. The nonfinancial corporate business sector
in particular relies heavily on external funds to finance its investment in
new plant and equipment, and historically the great bulk of such external

funds have come from borrowing at long term. Especially now that increased
physical capital formation to spur the U.S. economy's productivity and
international competitiveness has become a widely accepted goal of public
policy, any significant erosion of the market system's ability to provide
the requisite financial capital would present cause for serious concern.
Although impairment of the capital raising mechanism is by no means the only
possible effect of increased interest rate volatility, it is surely among
the most important.

Exploring the effects of increased interest rate volatility on the
long-term capital raising mechanism is the primary objective of this paper.
Hence this analysis too deals with effects strictly within the financial

markets.2 what would ultimately matter for the determination of policy in
this context, of course, is the further implication of any change in the

capital raising mechanism on fixed capital formation. In principle it
would be possible to undertake a direct analysis of the effects of increased
volatility on actual physical investment and other aspects of nonfinancial

economic activity. Nevertheless, the accumulated experience since October
1979 is still too brief in comparison to the time lags involved, and too

many

relevant factors have undergone substantial change during these few

years, to warrant confidence in an

in

analysis

relating the post—1979 movement

fixed investment behavior to the increase in interest rate volatility.

Instead, the compromise sought here is to focus on the long—term capital

raising mechanism, thereby coming as close as possible to physical capital
formation decisions while still limiting the analysis to phenomena observed
within the financial markets.

—5—

Section I seeks to determine whether U.S. nonfinancial business
corporations have raised less of their external funds in the form of long—term

debt as a result of the increased interest rate volatility since October
1979. Because business conditions have hardly been "normal" during 1980 and
1981, simply comparing the bond share of total financing in these years with

the average bond share in prior years is of little value. The operational
question, instead, is whether a well developed model of corporations' bond
financing that explains the data satisfactorily before October 1979 fails to

do so thereafter. The specific model used here to address this question
relates corporations' long—term borrowing, for a given external deficit to
be financed, to a combination of portfolio substitution and expectation
effects based on the prevailing pattern of interest rates on alternative
financing strategies.
Section

II takes as given the amount of long-term corporate borrowing

done since October 1979 and seeks to determine whether the financial markets
have

made corporations pay more for the underwriting and initial distribution

of this debt. The most obvious measure of new issue costs for publicly
offered debt, the spread between the yields at which investment banking
syndicates buy new securities from issuers and sell them to investors, has
remained essentially fixed for many years on issues priced by negotiation and
usually varies for largely independent reasons on issues priced by competitive

bidding. Another important element of new issue costs, however, is the
spread between the yield at which investors initially buy new securities and
the currently prevailing yield on comparable securities already outstanding.

This element

of the interest rate on new issues is also a genuine cost of

borrowing to the corporation, and at times it is a larger cost than
due

that

to the underwriting spread. Using data on five different categories of

—6—

long—term corporate bond issues, the analysis here compares the average
values of this spread before and after the 1979 increase in interest rate
volatility.

Section III again takes as given the amount of long-term corporate
borrowing and seeks to determine whether the pattern of distribution of this

debt has changed since October 1979. One consequence of the increased
interest rate volatility frequently alleged by market participants is that
the U.S. long—term bond market has become a vehicle more for "speculation"

than for "investment." Although several possible operational renderings of
that proposition lie beyond the scope of this paper, it is straightforward
to determine whether specific classes of investors —-

for

example, life

insurance companies, or private pension funds, or individuals -— have played

a greater or lesser role in long-term lending than in prior years. To the
extent that these classes of investors typically exhibit portfolio behavior
which is more homogeneous within classes than across classes, such shifts
in the distribution of bond holdings also signify changes in the behavior
of the overall market.

Section IV briefly summarizes the paper's empirical findings and
re—emphasizes some important caveats.

—7—

I. Efft of Volatility on the Volume of Long—Term Corporate Financing
In considering ways in which the recent increase in interest rate
volatility may have effected the U.S. financial markets, and the implications
that any such effects may have for choosing a monetary policy framework, it

is best to start from the fundamentals. Despite the life of their own that
financial markets seem to lead, the basic role of the financial markets. in

any economy is to facilitate nonfinancial economic activity. In an advanced
economy like that of the United States, one of the most important specific

ways in which the financial markets serve this function is by coordinating
the independent actions of real savers and real investors that together
determine the economy's physical capital formation.
One of the most widely recognized priorities in American economic

policy today is the need to increase the nation's capital formation. Although
economists and others continue to debate the reasons underlying the slowdown
in U.S. productivity growth during the 1970s, there is broad agreement that
additional investment in plant and equipment would contribute to a recovery
of productivity growth -- and hence growth of the nation's standard of
living --

in

the future. Meanwhile, however, the capital formation rate

has been not rising but falling. After a sharp increase in the l960s attributable to specific investment incentives legislated early in the decade,
investment in business plant and equipment (net of replacement for depreciation
and obsolescence) declined from 4.0% of the gross national product on

average during 1966-70 to 2.8% on average during 1976-80. Reversing this
decline has become a major priority of public policy.

Financial markets are relevant to this objective because every physical

investment decision has its financial counterpart. More to the point, the
financial transactions associated with physical capital formation are not

—8—

merely a reflection of real resource allocations that would necessarily come

about in any case. The setting in which the financing of capital formation
takes place can also importantly affect the allocation of real resources,
including the total amount of capital formation as well as its composition.
If increased interest rate volatility were to impair the market mechanism
for financing capital formation, in the end it would restrict the economy's
ability to undertake capital formation too.
Because corporations in nonfinancial lines of business regularly
account for nearly three—quarters of all plant and equipment investment in
the United States, it makes sense to focus the analysis on the economy's

nonfinancial corporate sector. U.S. nonfinancial corporations typically
rely heavily on external funds from the markets to finance their capital

expenditures. External funds constituted 45.5% of total sources of funds for
these firms, on average during the decade ending in 1980. Given U.S. corporations' traditional reluctance to raise equity capital except by retaining
earnings, most of the external funds raised are usually in debt form (92.2%

during 1971—80). Moreover, given the risk-averse preference for using
obligations of longer maturity to finance investment in long-lived facilities,
most of this debt has taken the form of bonds, mortgages, or other long-term

instruments. Despite the much discussed increase in reliance on short—term
debt in the l970s, net new issues of long—term obligations accounted for an
average 72.4% of all credit market borrowing by U.S. nonfinancial corporations
during 1971-80, and long-term obligations constituted 72.2% of these
corporations'

total debt outstanding as of yearend 1980.

Has this pattern changed significantly since the Federal Reserve System
implemented its new policy procedures? A simple inspection of financing data

reveals

that business reliance on short—term debt has indeed been high since

—9—

October

subtle

1979. Concluding that something fundamental

matter, however. To begin, only two

years

has changed is a more

of experience does not

constitute much of a laboratory for judging changes in economic behavior.
Further, the pattern of the business cycle and of interest rate movements
(wholly apart from short-run volatility) has been extraordinary during these

years. Any judgment that a change in corporate financing behavior has
occurred, which may have resulted from increased interest rate volatility,
must therefore rely on a model that takes account of as many key factors as
possible other than the increased volatility.
The model of nonfinancial corporations' long—term borrowing developed
in Friedman [71

cOmbines the familiar linear homogeneous

The primary rationale motivating the use of the linear homogeneous
portfolio selection model is, as usual, its convenience and tractability.
In a single—period context, the assumption of constant relative risk aversion
and joint normally distributed yield assessments is sufficient to render

the linear homogeneous model optimal.3 Some adjustment model is then
necessary in a multi—period context in the presence of transactions costs.
The principal advantage of the optimal marginal adjustment model for this purpose is that it represents, in a tractable way, the increased yield sensitivity

of the allocation of the flow AD in comparison with the re-allocation of the

stock Dt1. This distinction is especially relevant when, as is the case in
the United States, most long—term corporate liabilities are non-callable for
at least some substantial time (typically five years for utility companies
and ten years for other corporate borrowers) after the date of issue.4
Because of the non—callability of corporate bonds, the corporation's
choice between long— and short-term financing at any time is more complex than
a simple comparison of the prevailing yields on long- and short-term debt

instruments. A decision not to finance at long—term leaves open the possibility of continually rolling over short-term debt, as well as the possibility
of relying on short-term debt only temporarily and issuing long-term debt

later on. At the least, therefore, the financing decision depends on the
currently prevailing long-term yield, the expected average long-term yield
in the future, and the expected average short-term yield currently and in
the

future.5

Hence rewriting (1) for the specific case of long—term bonds

gives (at a minimum)
=

BlrB

+ BtBt + B3t + B

where B* is the corporation's desired amount of bonds outstanding, rB is the

—11—

currently prevailing yield on new issues of the corporation's bonds, r is
the corporation's expectation of the average future value of rB and

is

the corporation's expectation of the average current and future yield on its
short—term securities.

fails to do so thereafter. In contrast to the absence of any within-sample
residuals greater than three standard deviations, the out-of—sample prediction
error is greater than three standard deviations in five of seven

quarters.

Indeed,

several of the prediction errors exceed the equation's standard

error by absurd amounts.
In

addition, the pattern of sustained under-prediction of long-term

borrowing beginning at midyear 1980 also suggests that some factor representing
a break from prior experience had come into play. Two specific aspects of

this

series of negative values bear comment. First, as is clear from the

actual versus predicted values shown in the table, the problem is not the
familiar story of data moving into a new range into which an equation, with
its coefficients presumably biased toward zero, cannot follow.

Instead,

given the size of corporations' external deficits and the other explanatory
variables, the equation predicts a sharp rise in long—term borrowing which

(except for 1980:11) never materialized. Second, the series of large (in
absolute value) residuals of the same sign stands in stark contrast to the

within-sample pattern of nearly adjacent offsetting residuals. During the
last three quarters of the sample, for example, the —1.8 standard deviation
residual in 1979:111 about offset the 1.5 standard deviation residual in

1979:1. Similarly, the only four in-sample residuals to exceed 2.0 standard
deviations

standard

also occurred in a nearly adjacent and offsetting way (2.2 and -2.8

deviations in 1975:1 and 1975:111, respectively, and —2.5 and 2.8 in

1977:11 and l977:IV respectively).8
At a moze formal level, a chow test for the null hypothesis that
the equation's coefficients estimated over 1960:11 - 1979:111 remained

unchanged when estimated over 1960:11 — 1981:11 produced an F—statistic of

6.10 ——

far

in excess of the 2.93 value needed to reject the null hypothesis

at the 1% significance level. By contrast, the result of an analogous Chow
test for stability of the equation's coefficients over the 1960:11 —

1977:IV

versus 1960:11 — 1979:111 samples (that is, deleting the last seven observations

—15—

instead of adding seven more) did not warrant rejecting the null hypothesis,
even at the more standard 5% level.

Because the •k coefficients in the underlying portfolio selection
model (1) depend on the variarice—covariance structure of the joint distribu-

tion of the associated yields, it is not surprising that a sharp increase
in interest rate volatility like that which occurred after 1979:111 would

have led to instability in an estimated relationship like (5)•9 Indeed,
the results in this regard go further than the Chow test's rejection of the

joint stability of all of the model's coefficients. The results of estimating
(4) over 1960:11 —

1981:11, incorporating shift variables allowing the three

Bi coefficients to assume different values during 1979:IV - 1981:11, indicated
significant evidence of a shift in each of the three)0
It is also useful to distinguish the respective roles of coefficient
shifts

versus expectation proxy errors in accounting for the over—prediction

of bond financing shown in Table 1.11 The

proxy for long—

(6) closely tracked movements in actual long-term

yields throughout the post—sample period. By contrast, the autoregressive
proxy for short—term yield expectations (7) was typically below the actual

level of short-term yields during this period. Because the expectations that

presumably

matter for corporations' financing decisions are unobservable,

these relationships do not necessarily

indicate either success or failure

of the autoregressive expectations proxies. To the extent that the low
values generated by (7) do indicate a failure of the expectations proxy,

however, given B3 > 0
needed

that

failure is in the direction opposite to that

to account for the over—prediction of long-term borrowing. On the

basis of this limited evidence, therefore, the over—prediction does appear

to be attributable to a shift in the portfolio behavior

represented by (1),

—16—

rather than to a failure of the autoregressive expectations proxies (6) and
(7).

In sum, the evidence provided by an empirical model of nonfinancial
business corporations' long—term borrowing behavior shows a significant
break between the post October 1979 experience and the relationships that

prevailed over the prior two decades. Moreover, since mid 1980 the change
from prior behavior has been in the direction of less long—term borrowing
than would previously have been consistent with corporations' overall borrowing
requirements and other factors affecting the financing decision.

—17-

II. Effects of Volatility on the Costs of Corporate Financing
The evidence presented in Section I, which shows a shift away from
long-term financing by U.S. nonfinancial business corporations, takes as

given the prevailing level of short— and long—term interest rates. To the
extent that that evidence indicates an effect of the post October 1979
increase in interest rate volatility on corporations' financing decisions,
therefore, it abstracts from effects directly associated with interest rate

levels. Such effects may be highly important, however. If the combination
of borrowers' and lenders' reactions to increased volatility has been to
raise the equilibrium level of long— relative to short—term interest rates,
the model of corporate financing behavior in (5) indicates that over time
corporations would finance less of a given external funds requirement at

long term. Moreover, models of business plant and equipment investment in the
tradition of Jorgenson [11] and Bischoff [l] indicate that over time an
increase in long—term interest rates would also depress capital expenditures,
so that there would be less external deficit to finance -— and less capital
formation to contribute to the economy's productivity.

Because of the short time interval that has elapsed since October 1979,

together

with the extraordinary pattern of business cycle developments during

this interval, it

is

simply too soon to draw a judgment about the extent (if

any) to which the increase in interest rate volatility has altered fundamental
relationships either among various interest rates or between interest rates

collectively and expected price inflation. The swings in the slope of the
maturity yield curve have been unprecedented during the past two-and-a-half

years, but then so have the swings in interest rates themselves. On average,
long—term rates have been somewhat below short—term rates, but such an
"inverted" relationship is not unknown, especially at times of weak business

—18—

activity. Just within the past year, both long- and

short-term

interest

rates have been unusually high in comparison to observed current price
inflation, but the conflicting cross—currents at work have prevented easy
inferences about the more important expectations of future price inflation.
Even if data were available to support a judgment

that correctly

inferred

real interest rates were abnormally high, it would be impossible to have
confidence in the attribution of this phenomenon to increased interest rate
12
volatility.
By contrast, one aspect of interest rate determination about which an
inference of this kind may

be plausible

on the basis of the limited experience

since October 1979 is the cost of long—term borrowing by corporations over
and above the interest rate prevailing in the bond market at any given time.
This cost is less fundamental in the sense of basic economic theory, but to
the corporate borrower (or would—be borrower) it is no less real than any

other component of the cost of borrowing. If a corporation must pay an
additional 1% per annum to borrow, it does not much matter whether the
increment reflects a higher equilibrium interest rate level, as in most
theoretical models, or a higher cost of borrowing over and above the equilibrium

level. The fact that most theoretical models assume away any market imperfections that could account for a cost above the equilibrium level is of no
comfort.

The most obvious element of the difference between the interest rate
paid by corporate borrowers and the prevailing market clearing rate is the
"spread" between the yield (price) at which corporations sell new bond issues
to underwriting syndicates and the yield (price) at which those syndicates in
turn sell the bonds

to investors. This spread is the syndicate members'

compensation for managing, underwriting, and distributing the new securities.

—3.9—

What little variation in this spread has taken place, however, does not
suggest any response to increased interest rate volatility. The spread on
high grade long-term bonds priced by negotiation between the issuing corporation

and the underwriting syndicate has remained essentially unchanged at

$8.75 per $1,000 of par

greater

value for more than two

decades, despite the presumed

underwriting risk associated with increased interest rate volatility

over

many years. The spread on bonds priced by competitive bidding among

rival

underwriting syndicates: (almost always issued by utility companies:)

is sometimes greater and sometimes smaller than $8.75; but its variation
over tire primarily reflects the ever shifting

competitive pressures within

the investment banking industry, rather than any changes in specific external
factors.
A second element of the difference between the interest rate
corporate

borrowers and the prevailing market clearing rate, which has shown a

sharp change since
which

paid by

October 1979, is

the spread between the

yield (price) at

underwriting syndicates sell new bond issues to investors and the yield

(price)

at which comparable issues already outstanding are then trading.

Although the spread between new issue and seasoned yields is less straightforward to analyze or even to measure than the underwriting spread, it is also
a genuine cost of borrowing to the corporation, and at times it is a larger
cost than that due to the underwriting spread.

Conard and Frankena

[3], in

their classic study of the new issue versus

seasoned yield spread in the U.S. corporate bond market, hypothesized that one
explanation for the existence of a positive spread is that it reduces under-

writing risk. By pricing new securities at a discount in comparison to
comparable

of

securities already outstanding, underwriters can enhance prospects

rapid distribution of the new issue and therefore minimize the risks

—20—

inherent in holding large amounts of the securities for several days or even

weeks. The simultaneous existence of the underwriting spread and the new
issue versus seasoned spread gives underwriters two tools with which to cope

with a changing market environment. In response to an increase in underwriting risk associated with increased interest rate volatility, underwriters
can either go ahead and assume the added risk and charge compensation for it

by increasing the purchase versus sale spread, or else offset the added risk

by increasing the new issue versus seasoned spread. Although neither Conard
and Frankena nor Ederington [4 ]

found clear cut evidence for such behavior,

neither study's sample period (1952—63 and 1964—71, respectively) withessed
anything like the increase in interest rate volatility that has occurred since
October 1979.

13

The first
the

three columns of Table 2

show the number of issues, and

mean and standard deviation of the same—day spread between each new

issue's

yield and Moody's comparable seasoned yield index, for five distinct

categories

of U.S. long-term corporate bond issues

first for the period

including 1977, 1978 and 1979 through September, and then for the period

including 1980 and 1981.14 Although the standard deviations are large,
indicating a substantial range of spreads, in four of the five categories

the mean spread exhibited a sharp increase after October 1979. For each of the
three categories of utility bonds (including telephone issues), the mean spread
rose from zero or slightly negative to about 50 basis points, or 1/2% per, annum.

For Aa—rated industrials the mean spread rose from about zero to 1/8% per annum.
Only in the case of A—rated industrials did the mean spread remain unchanged
(at
—4

1/8% per annum). For all five categories combined, the mean spread was
basis

points before October 1979

and 38 basis

points thereafter.

spreads like those shown in the second column of Table 2 may be misleading

because of coupon differences between specific new issues and the outstanding

issues used to compute the comparable seasoned yield indices. If two otherwise identical bonds bore different coupons but traded at the same yield
nonetheless, the bond with the lower coupon would be more attractive to

investors because of the lower probability of call. In addition, taxable
investors would find the bond with the lower coupon (and hence lower price)
more attractive because part of the return to holding it would take the
form of capital gain and would therefore be subject to preferential tax

treatment. For both reasons investors would bid up the price of the bond
with the lower coupon so that in market equilibrium it traded at a lower

overall yield. Hence when long-term interest rates in general are high in
comparison to the coupons on the bonds that make up the comparable seasoned
yield indices, so that the bonds in the index are trading at discounts from
par, some positive spread between a new issue's yield and the comparable

seasoned index is to be expected. Because the average level of long-term
interest rates was sharply higher during 1980—81 than during 1977-79 (14.61%
versus 9.22% for new issues of Aa—rated utility bonds, for example), it is
at least possible that the rise in new issue versus seasoned yield spreads
documented in Table 2 simply relected the associated coupon differentials
rather than any effect on the market pricing mechanism due to increased

interest rate volatility. Hence some allowance for the coupon differential
is necessary.

In the absence of an exact measure of the relevant coupon differential
for each new bond issue,'5 one way to control for the effect of changing
coupon differentials on new issue versus seasoned yield spreads in this
context is to relate the observed spread directly to the seasoned yield,

—22—

as in the regression

(r.-r.) =
Ni Si

t3

+r.,+D.+(Dr.)
Oi ii Si

(8)

where rN is the yield on an individual new issue and r5 the yield on the
comparable Moody's seasoned yield index on the day of that new issue, both
measured in basis points; D is a dummy variable equal to 1 if the new issue
appeared in the 1980-81 part of the sample and 0 otherwise; and the i subscript

indicates a specific new issue. The rationale underlying (8) is that, for a
given sample of bonds comprising the seasoned yield index, and for new issues
priced approximately at par (which is usually the case), movements in the

seasoned yield index r will be closely and positively correlated with movements in the differential between the coupon on each new issue and the mean

coupon on the bonds comprising the index. To the extent that movements in
are a valid proxy for movements in the coupon differential, the implied
coupon—adjusted yield spread is a simple function of the intercept and slope
values in (8) together with the value of the mean coupon on the bonds in

the index.'6 Because the presence of the dummy variable in (8) allows the
intercept and slope to shift after October 1979, it also allows the implied
coupon—adjusted yield spread to change.

The use of movements in r5 as a proxy for movements in the new issue
versus seasoned yield index coupon differential in (8) is subject to two

biases which act in opposite directions. First, because the mere existence
of a positive coupon differential will cause a positive spread (rN— rh),

movements of r5 would understate the movement of the differential if the
bonds used in compiling the seasoned index remained umchanged throughout the

sample. Second, because Moody's Investors Service does change the composition
of each index over time, however, typically by substitutions that bring the

—23—

average

coupon of the included bonds more nearly into line with prevailing

new issue yields, movements of r would overstate the movement of the coupon
differential if there were no resulting yield differential. On balance,

how good a proxy r8 is for the coupon differential in a regression context
depends on the extent to which these two biases offset one another.
Table 3 shows the results of estimating (8) for each of the five
categories of bond issues included in Table 2, first subject to the constraint
=

= 0,

next subject only to the constraint

= 0 (so that the intercept

may differ in the two parts of each sample), and finally subject to no con-

straint (so that both the intercept and the slope may differ). The basic

regressions with &

=0

consistently show in

the expected positive

effect of the coupon differential (proxied by re), ranging from a maximum
of 14 basis points of yield spread per 1% of coupon differential for Aaarated telephone issues to a minimum of 7

differential

basis

points of spread per 1% of

for A—rated industrials. The intercepts

are uniformly

negative because the correction for the average difference between the mean

level

of r and

yield

spread after adjustment for the differential. The overall fit of the

the mean level of the coupon differential exceeds the mean

equations, and with it the significance level of the estimated slope
coefficients, varies from surprisingly strong for the telephone issues to
negligible for the A-rated industrials.
The

results of estimating (8) with either the intercept or the inter-

cept and the slope free to differ across the two subsamples are mixed. With
= 0 still, the intercept shift

typically does not significantly differ

from zero. With both coefficients free to change, the slope shift l is
uniformly positive, and

significantly

so (at least marginally) for three

categories of issues. At the same time

more securities in syndicate. A rising interest rate level would lead to

categories of new issues, first subject to the constraint

Although none of the coefficients on the three new variables included in (9)
is uniformly significant, all three typically exhibit the expected positive
sign, and those on the issue size and expectation variables are at least

marginally significant at least half the time. In the first equation for
Aa—rated utilities, for example, 33 = .19 indicates that an additional $100
million in issue size raises the new issue yield by 19 basis points after

allowance for all other factors. Similarly, in the first equation for Baa—
rated utilities, 14 =

.15 indicates that a recent increase of 1% in short-

term interest rates raises the new issue yield by 15 basis points after
allowance for all other factors.

Although the inclusion of the three additional variables in (9) leads
to results that may shed interesting light on other questions, it does little
to alter the basic implications for the question of shift in either intercept
or coupon differential slope already contained in the results of estimating

(8). Once again the intercept shift

III. Effects of Volatility on the Distribution of Bond Purchases
The evidence presented in Sections I and II, suggesting changes in the
operation of the U.S. long—term corporate capital market since October 1979,
focuses

first on borrowing corporations and then on the market intermediary

as represented by the underwriting mechanism. The other side of the market,

of

course, is the lender -—

that

is, the investor who ultimately holds

nonfinancial corporations' bonds. Just as nonfinancial corporations and
investment bankers may have changed their respective ways of doing business
in response to the increase in interest rate volatility, so too may portfolio
investors.

Even the most casual conversations with participants in the U.S.
corporate bond market in recent times almost inevitably lead to some form
of assertion that the behavior of investors in the market has indeed changed

during the past two years. The notion which most typically arises is that
purchasers of

long—term bonds have become "speculators" rather than "investors,

portfolio

making

decisions more on the basis of expectations of capital gain

(or fears of capital loss) over very short time horizons instead of assess-

ments of prevailing interest rates in the context of longer—run portfolio

objectives. To be sure, this process has been under way for many years,
as the bond market itself has become more liquid and interest rate (and
hence bond price) fluctuations have intensified since the relatively tran-

quil days of the early l960s, Even so, the overwhelming consensus among
market participants appears to be that the acceleration of this process
during the past two years has constituted a qualitatively new phenomenon.

If true, such a development would be at least consistent with —

if not

directly due to — the sharp increase in interest rate volatility in this
period.

There are many senses in which it could be true that "speculation"

—28—

has replaced "investment" as a mode of behavior on the lenders! side of

the bond market. The same individuals and institutions that played active
roles in the market before could still be doing so, but could have changed

their respective patterns of portfolio behavior. In addition -- or alternatively ——

the

more risk averse or far sighted individuals could have withdrawn

from the market, with other individuals who are more comfortable with risk
yet more concerned with short-run portfolio performance taking their places;

and a similar exchange of places could have occurred among institutions. While
both of these interpretations of the widespread perception of change are
entirely plausible, providing evidence to document or contradict either possibility lies well beyond the scope of this paper.
another, more readily explored, sense in which the market's behavior

may have changed is that some specific classes of investors could have reduced
their participation, with other specific investor classes taking their place.
Because of the great diversity of legal and regulatory constraints under which
various kinds of financial institutions operate in the United States, not to
mention the divergence in specific practice appropriate to their respective
lines of business, different classes of institutions typically exhibit

sharply different portfolio behavior.'9 To the extent that such classes of
investors exhibit portfolio behavior which is more homogeneous within classes
than across classes, any shifts in the relative importance of specific classes'
market participation imply changes in the equilibrium characteristics of the

for the first fifteen years of this period, then individually for the five

years leading up to and including the October 1979 change in monetary policy
procedures, and then individually for the two subsequent years in which
interest rate volatility has been so much greater.
Although many regularities do emerge in an inspection of these data
—-

for

example, the historical and continuing role of life insurance companies

and state—local government retirement funds as major providers of long—term
debt capital to business ——

the

data also convey an impression of enormous

variation from year to year in the distribution of net bond purchases,

depending on the specific market circumstances. Just within the five years
1975—79, for example, the share of total net bond purchases accounted for by
life insurance companies varied from barely one—fourth to over one-half.
Similarly, households accounted for more than one—fourth of all net purchases
in 1976 and nearly one—third in 1979, but were themselves net sellers of

corporate bonds in each of the two intervening years.21
Against the background of this substantial variation, the chief
aspects of the distribution of bond purchases since October 1979 that have

been clearly out of the ordinary all occurred during 1981: the unprecedented
liquidation of bond holdings by households, the unprecedented absorption
of bonds by securities brokers and dealers, and the unprecedented absorption

of bonds by foreign investors. During the first three quarters of last
year (the latest period for which data are available at the time of writing),
the net sale of bonds by households exceeded the market's entire net new

isue volume. In other words, because of net selling by households, all
other classes of investors together absorbed more than twice the net amount
of bonds that would have been necessary to clear the market if the only

net "sales" had come from net new borrowing by corporate issuers. Securities

—30—

brokers arid dealers and foreign investors, however, increased their bond
purchases by well over a factor of two.

The massive liquidation of bond portfolios by households in 1981 was
clearly extraordinary, but its connection to the post October 1979 increase

in interest rate volatility is hardly obvious. Not only was there no such
liquidation in 1980, but that which occurred during 1981 took place entirely

in the second and third quarters of the year. These six months were a peak
period for long—term interest rates, and many individuals may have been
responding more to the opportunity to create tax losses before the 1981
legislation lowered marginal tax rates than to any aversion to volatility

per se. More broadly, still other factors like the weakness of personal
income associated with the renewed recession in business activity may also

have been partly responsible. In the absence of a specific model of households'
portfolio behavior that allows for as many such factors as possible --

in

short, an analog to the model of nonfinancial corporations' borrowing behavior
in (5) —- no strong inference linking this shift in households' bond market

activity to interest rate volatility is warranted.22

The increased
brokers

and

share of net bond purchases accounted for by securities

dealers and by foreign investors is more clearly consistent

with the commonly perceived shift in the market's character.

Wholly apart

from the question of whether the increase in interest rate volatility per
se motivated these two investor groups' increased participation, they are
more likely to exhibit "speculative" behavior than are the traditional
major bond investors like life insurance companies and pension funds.
In sum, despite an unprecedented change in households' bond market

portfolio
securities

behavior since October 1979, and an

accompanying

change in that of

brokers and dealers and foreign investors, there is no clear

—31—

evidence that the increase in interest rate volatility has altered behavior
on the lenders' side of the U.S. corporate bond market.

—32--

IV. Concluding Remarks
The evidence presented in this paper leads to three conclusions about
possible effects on the U.S. long-term capital raising mechanism due to the
sharp increase in interest rate volatility that has followed the Federal

Reserve System's adoption of new monetary policy procedures in 1979. First,
the increased volatility has probably led nonfinancial corporations to finance
less of their external funds requirements at long term than they would other-

wise have done. Second, the increased volatility has probably led underwriters
of high grade corporate bonds to increase the spread of a typical new issue's
yield over the prevailing market yield on comparable bonds already outstanding.
Third, there is little firm basis (reported here, anyway) to conclude that
the increased volatility in particular has affected investors' portfolio
behavior in the bond market.
Each of these three conclusions (especially the two positive ones)

bears treating with substantial caution. The experience from October 1979 to
date spans too short an interval to support any judgment with confidence,

given the difficulties that always hinder economic inference. Moreover, the
specific aspects of economic behavior under scrutiny here ——
finance, investment banking, and portfolio investment —-

are

corporate
sufficiently

imperfectly understood at a quantitative level to render sharp judgments

risky even on the basis of more ample data. Further, the research reported
in this paper carries none of the three separate analyses conducted to the
full depth feasible within even the limited data and analytical tools
available.

Even so, the conclusions reached here about the effects of increased
interest rate volatility on the capital raising mechanism are suggestive.

Because

the potential economic consequences of significantly impairing that

—33—

mechanism are great, even these tentative conclusions should serve both as
a warning of caution for public policy and

as

a spur to further research.

1. It is always possible, of course, that the increase in interest rate
volatility since October 1979 has occurred for reasons unrelated to the
change in Federal Reserve operating procedures. An analysis of the
effects of that volatility would still be useful in that case, but
its conclusions would then carry no implications for monetary policy.
2. The analysis focuses on a subset of the effects investigated empirically
by Johnson et al. [10] and considered at the a priori level by Lombra
and Struble [14]; see both papers for references to the relevant earlier
literature on interest rate volatility.
3. See Friedman and Role; [9] for a proof of this proposition, together with
and it, in (1) from the parameters of the
expressions deriving the
joint distribution of the yield asessments and the borrower's (or
investor's) coefficient of relative risk aversion. The form of (1) used
in Friedman [7] also allowed for several non—yield influences on portfolio
selection, but none of these proved statistically significant in the
estimated equation presented below; see foothote 6.

4. See Friedman [51 for the development of the optimal marginal adjustment
model, and Friedman [71 for its application in the context of corporationst
choice of liabilities.
5. The time shapes of these "average" expectations depend on the results of
a dynamic programing optimization involving, among other factors, the
associated perceived variances and covariances; see the model of call—
deferred optimal financing in Bodie and Friedman [2].

coefficient in the expanded model, in each case preliminary experimentation
did not indicate a value significantly different from zero. For the
retained earnings and fixed investment variables, the most important of
the non—yield influences in [71, the estimated coefficients (and t—
statistics) were 0.6275 (1.5) and 0.04277 (0.1), respectively. For
the expected inflation proxy the estimated coefficient was —0.02577 (—0.4).

of those two coefficients is of course conditional on the unit

sum constraint. The estimation procedure used here also constrains each
set of lag weights to follow a third-degree polynomial pattern, with the
right-hand tial of the lag constrained to pass through zero, and with
each lead weight (Yo or ti) free of the polynomial constraint but still
included in the unit sum constraint. See Friedman [7] for further
details of the estimation process.
8. A third important aspect of the equation's post-sample over-prediction
is that these data on "actual long—term borrowing" in fact include both
long- and intermediate—term issues. The shift in the mix of new issue
maturities from long to intermediate term during the last two years
further compounds the result shown here.

9. Simply introducing an

interest rate volatility measure on the righthand side of (5) leads, as would be expected, to a negative coefficient
that is significant at the 5% level when the equation is estimated
over 1960:11 — 1981:11, but not over 1960:11 — 1979:111. For all of the
reasons advanced above, however, such a finding is of questionable
value. Practically any variable that has shown a sudden increase
after mid 1979 would produce similar results.

10. The t-statistics for the three individual coefficient shifts were 2.8

for Bl' -2.5 for B2 and -3.0 for B3
11. The predicted values shown in Table 1 rely on period-by-period updating
of all right-hand side variables in (5), including the lagged interest
rate observations in (6) and (7).
12. Adding an interest rate volatility measure to any standard unrestricted
reduced—form term—structure equation, estimated directly with the longterm yield as the dependent variable, would presumably result in a
significantly positive coefficient. It is not clear what such an
exercise would contribute to understanding of interest rate relationships,
however; see again foothote 9.

13.

Researchers investigating the underwriting of new equity issues have
found more mixed results on this question, although the respective
hypotheses for the cases of bond and stock issues are not fully
comparable. See, for example, Scholes [15], Logue [13] and Stoll [16].

14. A break—down between issues priced by negotiation versus competitive
bidding, within the utility (and post-1979 Bell Telephone) groups,
showed no apparent differences that would warrant allowing for this
distinction in the analysis that follows. The omission of the final
three months of 1979, on the ground that underwriters would have needed
some time to observe the increase in interest rate volatility before
reacting to it, has essentially no effect on the results reported here
(and in Tables 3—5 below) because there were so few issues during those
months. For the five categories of issues shown in the table, the
numbers of new issues during October—December 1979 were, respectively,
2,

6, 1, 0 and 0.

15. Following Conard and Frankena, an alternative approach would be to
construct a separate yield index with average coupon identical to that
of each new issue. This approach would be difficult to implement,
not only because of the amount of data manipulation required but also
because of the need for tenuously based interpolation and extrapolation
for many issues.

16. More specifically, assume that the composition of the index is fixed
and that the bonds in the index are priced at par on average over time,
so that the mean seasoned index coupon is ks =
where i is the mean
observed value of rS during the sample period. Also assume that each
new issue is priced at par and — now abstracting from the yield effect
of the coupon differential — at a yield equal to that on comparable
seasoned issues, so that the coupon on any new issue is kN = rc.
the discussion below explains, each of these assumptions introduces
a bias of known sign in what follows,) If the relationship between the
yield spread and the coupon differential is the linear rN - rS =
c + 13(kN-ks), then substituting and rearranging yields (8) where, apart
and l = 3. Because the equation
from the durruny variable, o =
includes an intercept, there is no implication that the level of
is a proxy for the level of the coupon differential.

17. The two values reported for each category of bonds are, first,
+ ftFs where ?s is the 1977—79 mean of rS and, second, 13j +
+
÷ i1s where s is the 1980—81 mean of rS. See again footnote 16.
18. For (8) this result is to be expected, in that the F-statistic just shows
the joint significance of o and51 together. For (9) the F—statistic
applies to a test for no change not only in
and
but also in 2' 3

21. Households cannot issue new corporate bonds, of course; net sales
represent an excess of aggregate gross sales of bonds already held in
portfolios over aggregate gross purchases. The household sector of the
flow-of—funds accounts consists primarily of individuals but also
includes non—profit institutions and bank—managed personal trusts.
22. The converse is also true for the other investor classes. Post 1979
behavior that appears ordinary enough on casual inspection may be
unusual in the context of a model allowing for independent factors.
n approach to this problem analogous to that employed in Section I
would be to estimate the six bond demand equations developed in Friedman [51
using data through 1979:111, and then test the estimated relationships
using post-sample data. Such an investigation lies beyond the scope of
this paper.
