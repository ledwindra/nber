    "abstract": "\n\nI suggest a novel theory of GATT/WTO negotiations based on the Krugman (1980) \"new trade\" model. It emphasizes international production relocations and is easy to calibrate to bilateral trade data. Focusing on the major players in recent GATT/WTO negotiations, I find that it implies reasonable noncooperative tariffs as well as moderate gains from GATT/WTO negotiations.\n\n",
