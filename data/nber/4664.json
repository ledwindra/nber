    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper documents and analyzes changes in the wage structure across manufacturing industries over the last one hundred years. Inter-industry differentials in wages are highly stable for production workers, but autocorrelation patterns for nonproduction workers are considerably weaker.  Industry wage patterns are very similar for production and nonproduction workers today, but this has been true only since 1958.  Dispersion of wages across industries has shown varying trends over the last one hundred years, but has never in this century been higher than it is today.  The variables that are most strongly correlated with wage growth are productivity growth, rising union density, rising capital intensity, and profit growth.\n\n",
