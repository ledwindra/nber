    "abstract": "\n\nThe economic progress of U.S. men has stagnated in recent decades, with declining labor force participation and weak growth in real earnings, particularly for less educated and non-white men. In this paper, we illuminate the broader context in which prime-age men are experiencing economic stagnation. We explore changes for prime-age men over time in education, mortality, morbidity, disability program receipt, family structure, and incarceration rates, indicators that may be affected by men\u2019s sluggish economic progress or play a role in explaining it, or both.  While establishing causality for such a wide range of health and other outcomes is inherently difficult, we discuss clues provided by recent research.\n\n",
