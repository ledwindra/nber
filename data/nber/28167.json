    "abstract": "\n\nBetween the Civil War and the turn of the nineteenth century there were many prominent African American jockeys. They rode winners in all of the Triple-Crown races. But at the turn of the century they were forced out. This paper uses a new data set on the Triple-Crown races, which includes odds on all of the entrants in all of the races, to explore the causes of the expulsion of African American jockeys. Our conclusion is that although there is some evidence of prejudice by owners and the betting public \u2013 for the latter in the Kentucky Derby although not in the other legs of the Triple Crown \u2013 historical evidence indicates that the final push came from the White jockeys who were determined to \u201cdraw the color line.\u201d\n\n",
