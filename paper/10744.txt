ABSTRACT
Microeconomic flexibility, by facilitating the process of creative-destruction, is at the core of
economic growth in modern market economies. The main reason for why this process is not
infinitely fast, is the presence of adjustment costs, some of them technological, other institutional.
Chief among the latter is labor market regulation. While few economists would object to such a
view, its empirical support is rather weak. In this paper we revisit this hypothesis and find strong
evidence for it. We use a new sectoral panel for 60 countries and a methodology suitable for such
a panel. We find that job security regulation clearly hampers the creative-destruction process,
especially in countries where regulations are likely to be enforced. Moving from the 20th to the 80th
percentile in job security, in countries with strong rule of law, cuts the annual speed of adjustment
to shocks by a third while shaving off about one percent from annual productivity growth. The same
movement has negligible effects in countries with weak rule of law.

Introduction

Microeconomic flexibility, by facilitating the ongoing process of creative-destruction, is at the core of economic growth in modern market economies. This basic idea has been with economists for centuries, was
brought to the fore by Schumpeter fifty years ago, and has recently been quantified in a wide variety of contexts.1 In US Manufacturing, for example, more than half of aggregate productivity growth can be directly
linked to this process.2
The main obstacle faced by microeconomic flexibility is adjustment costs. Some of these costs are
purely technological, others are institutional. Chief among the latter is labor market regulation, in particular job security provisions. The literature on the impact of labor market regulation on the many different
economic, political and sociological variables associated to labor markets and their participants is extensive
and contentious. However, the proposition that job security provisions reduce restructuring is a point of
agreement.
Despite this consensus, the empirical evidence supporting the negative impact of labor market regulation
on microeconomic flexibility has been scant at best. This is not too surprising, as the obstacles to empirical success are legions, including poor measurement of restructuring activity and labor market institutions
variables, both within a country and more so across countries. In this paper we make a new attempt. We
develop a methodology that allows us to bring together the extensive new data set on labor market regulation constructed by Djankov et al. (2003) with comparable cross-country cross-sectoral data on employment
and output from the UNIDO (2002) data-set. We also emphasize the key distinction between effective and
official labor market regulation.
The methodology builds on the simple partial-adjustment idea that larger adjustment costs are reflected
in slower employment adjustment to shocks.3 The accumulation of limited adjustment to these shocks
builds a wedge between frictionless and actual employment, which is the main right hand side variable in
this approach. We propose a new way of estimating this wedge, which allows us to pool data on labor market
legislation with comparable employment and output data for a broad range of countries. As a result, we are
able to enlarge the effective sample to 60 economies, more than double the country coverage of previous
studies in this literature.4 Our attempt to measure effective labor regulation interacts existing measures of
job security provision with measures of rule of law and government efficiency.
Our results are clear and robust: countries with less effective job security legislation adjust more quickly
to imbalances between frictionless and actual employment. In countries with strong rule of law, moving
from the 20th to the 80th percentile of job security lowers the speed of adjustment to shocks by 35 percent
and cuts annual productivity growth by 0.86 percent. The same movement for countries with low rule of law

Methodology and Data
Methodology

2.1.1 Overview
The starting point for our methodology is a simple adjustment hazard model, where the change in the
number of (filled) jobs in sector j in country c between time t − 1 and t is a probabilistic (at least to the
econometrician) function of the gap between desired and actual employment:
∆e jct = ψ jct Gap jct

Gap jct ≡ e∗jct − e jc,t−1 ,

(1)

where e jct and e∗jct denote the logarithm of employment and desired employment, respectively. The random
variable ψ jct , which is assumed i.i.d. both across sectors and over time, takes values in the interval [0, 1] and
has country-specific mean λc and variance ωc λc (1 − λc ), with 0 ≤ ωc ≤ 1. The case ωc = 0 corresponds
to the standard quadratic adjustment model, the case ωc = 1 to the Calvo (1983) model. The parameter
λc captures microeconomic flexibility. As λc goes to one, all gaps are closed quickly and microeconomic
flexibility is maximum. As λc decreases, microeconomic flexibility declines.
Equation (1) hints at two important components of our methodology: We need to find a measure of
the employment gap and a strategy to estimate the average (over j and t) speeds of adjustment (the λc ).
We describe both ingredients in detail in what follows. In a nutshell, we construct estimates of e∗jct , the
only unobserved element of the gap, by solving the optimization problem of a sector’s representative firm,
as a function of observables such as labor productivity and a suitable proxy for the average market wage.
We estimate λc from (1), based upon the large cross-sectional size of our sample and the well documented
heterogeneity in the realizations of the gaps and the ψ jct ’s (see, e.g., Caballero, Engel and Haltiwanger
(1997) for US evidence).
2.1.2 Details
Output and demand for a sector’s representative firm are given by:
y = a + αe + βh,
1
p = d − y,
η

2

(2)
(3)

where y, p, e, a, h, d denote output, price, employment, productivity, hours worked and demand shocks, and
η is the price elasticity of demand. We let γ ≡ (η − 1)/η, with η > 1, 0 < α < 1, 0 < β < 1 and γ < 1/α.
All variables are in logs.
Firms are competitive in the labor market but pay wages that increase with the number of hours worked:
w = ko + log(H µ + Ω).
This can be approximated by:
w = wo + µ(h − h),

(4)

with wo and µ determined by ko and Ω, and h constant over time and interpreted below. In order to ensure
interior solutions, we assume αµ > β and µ > βγ.
A key assumption is that the representative firm within each sector only faces adjustment costs when it
changes employment levels, not when it changes the number of hours worked (beyond overtime payments).5
It follows that the sector’s choice of hours in every period can be expressed in terms of its current level of
employment, by solving the corresponding first order condition for hours.
In a frictionless labor market the firm’s employment level also satisfies a simple static first order condition for employment. Our functional forms then imply that the optimal choice of hours, h, does not depend
on the employment level. A patient calculation shows that
µ

h = log
µ
αµ − β
We denote the corresponding employment level by eb and refer to it as the static employment target:
eb = C +

1
[d + γa − wo ],
1 − αγ

with C a constant that depends on µ, α, β and γ.
The following relation between the employment gap and the hours gap then follows:
eb− e =

µ − βγ
(h − h).
1 − αγ

(5)

This is the expression used by Caballero and Engel (1993). It is not useful in our case, since we do
not have information on worked hours. Yet the argument used to derive (5) also can be used to express the
employment gap in terms of the marginal labor productivity gap:
eb− e =

φ
(v − wo ),
1 − αγ

where v denotes marginal productivity, φ ≡ µ/(µ − βγ) is decreasing in the elasticity of the marginal wage

evidence on this see Sargent (1978) and Shapiro (1986).

schedule with respect to average hours worked, µ − 1, and wo was defined in (4). Note that eb − e is the
difference between the static target eb and realized employment, not the dynamic employment gap e∗jct − e jct
related to the term on the right hand side of (1). However, if we assume that d + γa − wo follows a random
walk (possibly with an exogenously time varying drift) —an assumption consistent with the data6 — we
have that e∗jct is equal to ebjct plus a constant δct . It follows that
e∗jct − e jct−1 =

¢
φ ¡
v jct − wojct + ∆e jct + δct ,
1 − αγ j

(6)

where we have allowed for sector-specific differences in γ. Note that both marginal product and wages are
in nominal terms. However, since these expressions are in logs, their difference eliminates the aggregate
price level component.
We estimate the marginal productivity of labor, v jct , using output per worker multiplied by an industrylevel labor share, assumed constant whithin income groups and over time.
Two natural candidates to proxy for wojct are the average (across sectors within a country, at a given
point in time) of either observed wages or observed marginal productivities. The former is consistent with a
competitive labor market, the latter may be expected to be more robust in settings with long-term contracts
and multiple forms of compensation, where the salary may not represent the actual marginal cost of labor.7
We performed estimations using both alternatives and found no discernible differences (see below). This
suggests that statistical power comes mainly from the cross-section dimension, that is, from the well documented and large magnitude of sector-specific shocks. In what follows we report the more robust alternative
and approximate wo by the average marginal productivity, which leads to:
e∗jct − e jct−1 =

φ
(v jct − v·ct ) + ∆e jct + δct ≡ Gap jct + δct ,
1 − αγ j

(7)

where v·ct denotes the average, over j, of v jct , and we use this convention for other variables as well. The
expression above ignores systematic variations in labor productivity across sectors within a country, for
example, because (unobserved) labor quality may differ systematically across sectors. The presence of
such heterogeneity would tend to bias estimates of the speed of adjustment downward. To incorporate this
possibility we subtract from (v jct − v·ct ) in (7) a moving average of relative sectoral productivity, b
θ jct , where
1
b
θ jct ≡ [(v jct−1 − v·ct−1 ) + (v jct−2 − v·ct−2 )].
2
As a robustness check, for our main specifications we also computed b
θ jct using a three and four periods
moving average, without significant changes in our results (more on this when we check robustness in
all countries and sectors together, the first order autocorrelation of the measure of ∆e∗jct constructed below is −0.018.
Computing this correlation by country the mean value is 0.011 with a standard deviation of 0.179.
7 While we have assumed a simple competitive market for the base salary (salary for normal hours) within each sector, our
procedure could easily accommodate other, more rent-sharing like, wage setting mechanisms (with a suitable reinterpretation of
some parameters, but not λc ).

e∗jct − e jct−1 =

φ
(v jct − b
θ jct − v·ct ) + ∆e jct + δct ≡ Gap jct + δct ,
1 − αγ j

(8)

where αγ j is constructed using the sample median of the labor share for sector j across year and income
groups.
Rearranging (8), we estimate φ from
∆e jct = −

φ
(∆v jct − ∆v·ct ) + κct + υit + ∆e∗jct ≡ −φz jct + κct + ε jct ,
1 − αγ j

(9)

where κ is a country-year dummy, ∆e∗jct is the change in the desired level of employment and z jct ≡
(∆v jct − ∆v·ct )/(1 − αγ j ). We assume that changes in sectoral labor composition are negligible between
two consecutive years. In order to avoid the simultaneity bias present in this equation (∆v and ∆e∗ are
clearly correlated) we estimate (9) using (∆w jct−1 − ∆w·ct−1 ) as an instrument for (∆v jct − ∆v·ct ).8 Table 1
reports the estimation results of (9) for the full sample of countries and across income groups. The first two
columns use the full sample, with and without two percent of extreme values for the independent variable,
respectively. The remaining columns report the estimation results for each of our three income groups and
job security groups (more on both of these measures in Section 2.2). Based on our results for the baseline
case, we set the value of φ at its full sample estimate of 0.4 for all countries in our sample.
It is important to point out that our methodology has some advantages over standard partial adjustment
estimations. First, it summarizes in a single variable all shocks faced by a sector. This feature allows us to
increase precision and to study the determinants of the speed of adjustment using interaction terms. Second,
and related, it only requires data on nominal output and employment, two standard and well-measured
variables in most industrial surveys. Most previous studies on adjustment costs required measures of real
output or an exogenous measure of sector demand.9
2.1.3 Regressions
The central empirical question of the present study is how cross-country differences in job security regulation
affect the speed of adjustment. Accordingly, from (1) and (8) it follows that the basic equation we estimate
is:
∆e jct = λct (Gap jct + δct ),
8 We

(10)

lag the instrument to deal with the simultaneity problem and use the wage rather than productivity to reduce the (potential)
impact of measurement error bias.
9 Abraham and Houseman (1994), Hammermesh (1993), and Nickel and Nunziata (2000)) evaluate the differential response of
employment to observed real output. A second option is to construct exogenous demand shocks. Although this approach overcomes
the real output concerns, it requires constructing an adequate sectorial demand shock for every country. A case in point are the
papers by Burgess and Knetter (1998) and Burgess et al. (2000), which use the real exchange rate as their demand shock. The
estimated effects of the real exchange rate on employment are usually marginally significant, and often of the opposite sign than
expected.

where ∆e jct is the log change in employment and λct denotes the speed of adjustment. We assume that the
latter takes the form:
λct = λ1 + λ2 JSeff
ct ,

(11)

where JSeff
ct is a measure of effective job security regulation. In practice we observe job security regulation
(imperfectly), but not the rigor with which it is enforced. We proxy the latter with a “rule of law” variable,
so that
JSeff
ct = JSct (1 + aRLct ),

(12)

where a is a constant and RLct is a standard measure of rule of law (see below). Substituting this expression
in (11) and the resulting expression for λct in (10), yields our main estimating equation:
¡
¢
¡
¢
∆e jct = λ1 Gap jct + λ2 Gap jct × JSct + λ3 Gap jct × JSct × RLct + e
δct + ε jct ,

(13)

with λ3 = aλ2 and e
δct denotes country×time fixed effects (proportional to the δct defined above).
The main coefficients of interest are λ2 and λ3 , which measure how the speed of adjustment varies across
countries depending on their labor market regulation (both de jure and de facto).

2.2

The Data

This section describes our sample and main variables. Additional variables are defined as we introduce them
later in the text.
2.2.1 Job Security and Rule of Law
We use two measures of job security, or legal protection against dismissal: the job security index constructed
by Djankov et al. (2003) for 60 countries world-wide (henceforth JSc ) and the job security index constructed
by Heckman and Pages (2000) for 24 countries in OECD and Latin America (henceforth HPct ). The JSc
measure is available for a larger sample of countries and includes a broader range of job security variables.
The HPct measure has the advantage of having time variation.
Our main job security index, JSc , is the sum of four variables, measured in 1997, each of which takes
on values between 0 and 1: (i) grounds for dismissal protection PGc , (ii) protection regarding dismissal
procedures PPc , (iii) notice and severance payments PSc , and (iv) protection of employment in the constitution PCc . The rules on grounds of dismissal range from allowing the employment relation to be terminated
by either party at any time (employment at will) to allowing the termination of contracts only under a very
narrow list of “fair” causes. Protective dismissal procedures require employers to obtain the authorization
of third parties (such as unions and judges) before terminating the employment contract. The third variable, notice and severance payment, is the one closest to the HPct measure, and is the normalized sum of
two components: mandatory severance payments after 20 years of employment (in months) and months of
advance notice for dismissals after 20 years of employment (NStc = bct+20 + SPct+20 , t = 1997). The four

6

components of JSc described above increase with the level of job security.
The Heckman and Pages measure is narrower, including only those provisions that have a direct impact
on the costs of dismissal. To quantify the effects of this legislation, they construct an index that computes
the expected (at hiring) cost of a future dismissal. The index includes both the costs of advanced notice
legislation and firing costs, and is measured in units of monthly wages.
Our estimations also adjust for the level of enforcement of labor legislation. We do this by including
measures of rule of law RLc and government efficiency GEc from Kaufmann at al. (1999), and interact them
with JSc and HPct .10 We expect labor market legislation to have a larger impact on adjustment costs in
countries with a stronger rule of law (higher RLc ) and more efficient governments (higher GEc ).
The institutional variables as well as the countries in our sample and their corresponding income group
are reported in Table 2. Table 3 reports the sample correlations between our main cross-country variables
and summary statistics for each of these measures for three income groups (based on World Bank per capita
income categories).11 As expected, the correlation between the two measures of job security is positive and
significant. Differences can be explained mainly by the broader scope of the JSct index. Also as expected,
rule of law and government efficiency increase with income levels. Note, however, that neither measure of
job security is positively correlated with income per capita, since both JSct and HPc are highest for middle
income countries.
2.2.2 Industrial Statistics
Our output, employment and wage data come from the 2002 3-digit UNIDO Industrial Statistics Database.
The UNIDO database contains data for the period 1963-2000 for the 28 manufacturing sectors that correspond to the 3 digit ISIC code (revision 2). Because our measures of job security and rule of law are time
invariant and measured in recent years, however, we restrict our sample to the period 1980-2000. Data on
output and labor compensation are in current US dollars (inflation is removed through time effects in our
regressions). Throughout the paper our main dependent variable is ∆e jct , the log change in total employment
in sector j of country c in period t.
A large number of countries are included in the original dataset — however our sample is constrained
by the cross-country availability of the independent variables measuring job security. In addition, we drop
two percent of extreme employment changes in each of the three income groups. For our main specification
the resulting sample includes 60 economies. Table 3 shows descriptive statistics for the dependent variable
by income group.
10 For

rule of law and government efficiency we use the earliest value available in the Kaufmann et al. (1999) database: 1996,
since this is closest to the Djankov et al. (2003) measure, which is for 1997.
11 Income groups are: 1=High Income OECD, 2=High Income Non OECD and Upper Middle Income, 3=Lower Middle Income
and Low Income.

Results

This section presents our main result, showing that effective job security has a significant negative effect on
the speed of adjustment of employment to shocks in the employment-gap. It also presents several robustness
exercises.

3.1

Main results

Recall that our main estimating equation is:
¡
¢
¡
¢
∆e jct = λ1 Gap jct + λ2 Gap jct × JSc + λ3 Gap jct × JSc × RLc + e
δct + ε jct .

(14)

Note that we have dropped time subscripts from JSc and RLc as we only use time invariant measures of
rule of law and job security in our baseline estimation. Note also that in all specifications that include the
(Gapict × JSct × RLc ) interaction we also include the respective Gapict × RLc as a control variable.
We start by ignoring the effect of job security on the speed of adjustment, and set λ2 and λ3 equal
to zero. This gives us an estimate of the average speed of adjustment and is reported in column 1 of
Table 4. On average (across countries and periods) we find that 60% of the employment-gap is closed in
each period. Furthermore, our measure of the employment-gap and country×year fixed effects explain 60%
of the variance in log-employment growth.
The next three columns present our main results, which are repeated in columns 5 to 7 allowing for
different λ1 by sectors and country income level.12 Column 2 (and 5) presents our estimate of λ2 . This
coefficient has the right sign and is significant at conventional confidence levels. Employment adjusts more
slowly to shocks in the employment-gap in countries with higher levels of official job security.
Next, we allow for a distinction between effective and official job security. Results are reported in
columns 3 and 4 (and, correspondingly, 6 and 7) for different rules-enforcement criteria. In columns 3 and
6 the distinction between effective and official job security is captured by the product of JSc and DSRLc ,
where DSRLc is a dummy variable for countries with strong rule of law (RLc ≥ RLGreece — where Greece is
the OECD country with the lowest RL score). The three panels in Figure 1 show the value of the job security
index for countries in the high, medium and low income groups, respectively. Now λ2 becomes insignificant,
while λ3 has the right sign and is highly significant. That is, the same change in JSc will have a significantly
larger (downward) effect on the speed of adjustment in countries with stricter enforcement of laws, as
measured by our rule-of-law dummy. The effect of the estimated coefficients reported in column 3 is large.
In countries with strong rule of law, moving from the 20th percentile of job security (−0.19) to the 80th
percentile (0.23) reduces λ̂ by 0.22. The same change in job security legislation has a considerable smaller
effect, 0.006, on the speed of adjustment in the group of economies with weak rule of law. Employment
12 We allow for an interaction between Gap
jct and 3 digit ISIC sector dummies (we also include sector fixed effects). We also
control for the possibility that our results are driven by omitted variables, correlated with our measures of job security. For this, we
include an additional interaction between Gap jct and three income-group dummies.

adjusts more slowly to shocks in the employment-gap in countries with higher levels of effective job security.
Columns 4 and 7 address whether the negative coefficient on λ3 is robust to other measures of legal
enforcement. To do so we use an alternative variable from the Kaufmann et al. (1999) dataset – government
effectiveness (GE) – and construct a dummy variable for high effectiveness countries (GEc ≥GEGreece ).
Clearly, the results are very close to those reported in columns 3 and 7. Job security legislation has a
significant negative effect on the estimated speed of adjustment when governments are effective – a proxy
for enforcement of existing labor regulation.
Finally, the last column in Table 4 uses an alternative measure of job security. We repeat our specification
from column 7 (including sector and income dummies) using the Heckman-Pages (2000) measure of job
security. The HPct data are only available for countries in the OECD and Latin America so our sample
size is reduced by half, and most low income countries are dropped. The flip side is that this measure is
time varying which potentially allows us to capture the effects of changes in the job security regulation. As
reported in column 8, we find a negative and significant effect of HPct on the speed of adjustment.

3.2

Further robustness

We continue our robustness exploration by assessing the impact of three broad econometric issues: alternative gap-measures, exclusion of potential (country) outliers, and misspecification due to endogeneity of the
gap measure.
3.2.1 Alternative gap-measures
Table 4 suggests that conditional on our measure of the employment-gap, our main findings are robust: job
security, when enforced, has a significant negative impact on the speed of adjustment to the employment-gap.
Table 5 tests the robustness of this result to alternative measures of the employment-gap. Columns 1 and 2
relax the assumption of a φ common across all countries. They repeat our baseline specifications —columns
2 and 3 in Table 4— using the values of φ estimated per income-group reported in Table 1. In turn, columns
3 and 4 report the results of using values of φ estimated across countries grouped by level of job security.13
Next, columns 5 through 8 repeat our baseline specifications using a three and four period moving average
to estimate b
θ jct . The final two columns (9 and 10) use an alternative specification for wo based on average
jct

wages instead of average productivity (see equation 8) to build Gap jct . In all of the specifications reported
in Table 5, our results remain qualitatively the same as in Table 4.
3.2.2 Exclusion of potential (country) outliers
Table 6 reports estimates of λ2 and λ3 using the specification from column 3 in Table 4 but dropping one
country from our sample at a time. In all cases the estimated coefficient on λ3 is negative and significant at
conventional confidence intervals.
13 Countries

are grouped into the upper, middle and lower thirds of job security.

9

However, it is also apparent in this table that excluding either Hong Kong or Kenya makes a substantial
difference in the point estimates. For this reason, we re-estimate our model from scratch (that is, from φ
up) now excluding these two countries. In this case the value of φ rises from 0.40 to 0.42. Qualitatively,
however, the main results remain unchanged. Table 7 reports these results.
3.2.3 Potential endogeneity of the gap measure
One concern with our procedure is that the construction of the gap measure includes the change in employment. While this does not represent a problem under the null hypothesis of the model, any measurement
error in employment and φz jt could introduce important biases. We address this issue with two procedures.
Before describing these procedures, we note that the standard solution of passing the ∆e-component of
the gap defined in (8) to the left hand side of the estimating equation (10) does not work in our context.
Passing ∆e to the left suggests that the coefficient on the resulting gap will be equal to λ/(1 − λ). As
shown in Appendix A, this holds only in the case of a partial adjustment model (ω = 0 in the notation of
Section 2.1). By contrast, in the case of a Calvo-type adjustment (ω = 1), the corresponding coefficient will,
on average, be negative.14 More important, even small departures from a partial adjustment model (small
values of ω) introduce significant biases when estimating λ using this approach.
Next we turn to the two procedures. The first procedure maintains our baseline specification, but instruments for the contemporaneous gap measure. Given that Gap jct = φz jt + ∆e jct can be rewritten as
φz j,t−1 + ∆e∗jct , a natural instrument is the lag of the ex-post gap, φz jc,t−1 . Unfortunately, the latter is not a
valid instrument if it is computed with measurement error and this error is serially correlated. In our specification this could be the case because we use a moving average to construct the estimate of relative sectoral
productivity, b
θ jct . To avoid this problem, we construct an alternative measure of the ex-post gap letting wage
data play the role of productivity data when calculating the v and θ terms on the right hand side of (8).
The second procedure re-writes the model in a standard dynamic panel formulation that removes the
contemporaneous employment change from the right hand side:15
∆Gap jct = (1 − λc )∆Gap jct−1 + ε jct .

(15)

Table 8 reports the values of the average λ estimated with these two alternative, and much less precise,
procedures. For comparison purposes, the first row reproduces the first column in Table 4. The second row
shows the result for the IV procedure based on using lagged wages as instruments. Finally, Row 3 reports
the estimate from the dynamic panel. It is apparent from the table that the estimates of average λ are in the
right ballpark, and hence we conclude that the bias due to a potentially endogenous gap is not significant.
14 In

the Calvo-case, for every observation either the (modified) gap or the change in employment is zero. The former happens
when adjustment takes place, the latter when it does not. It follows that the covariance of ∆e and the (modified) gap will be equal to
minus the product of the mean of both variables. Since these means have the same sign, the estimated coefficient will be negative.
See Appendix A for a formal derivation.
15 To estimate this equation we follow Anderson and Hsiao (1982) and use twice and three-times lagged values of ∆Gap
jct as
instruments for the RHS variable. Similar results are obtained if we follow Arellano and Bond (1991).

Gauging the Costs of Effective Labor Protection

By impairing worker movements from less to more productive units, effective labor protection reduces aggregate output and slows down economic growth. In this section we develop a simple framework to quantify
this effect. Any such exercise requires strong assumptions and our approach is no exception. Nonetheless,
our findings suggest that the costs of the microeconomic inflexibility caused by effective protection is large.
In countries with strong rule of law, moving from the 20th to the 80th percentile of job security lowers annual productivity growth somewhere between 0.9 and 1.2 percent. The same movement for countries with
low rule of law has a negligible impact on TFP.
Consider a continuum of establishments, indexed by i, that adjust labor in response to productivity
shocks, while their share of the economy’s capital remains fixed over time. Their production functions
exhibit constant returns to (aggregate) capital, Kt , and decreasing returns to labor:
Yit = Bit Kt Litα ,

(16)

where Bit denotes plant-level productivity and 0 < α < 1. The Bit ’s follow geometric random walks, that
can be decomposed into the product of a common and an idiosyncratic component:
∆ log Bit ≡ bit = vt + vIit ,
where the vt are i.i.d. N (µA , σ2A ) and the vit ’s are i.i.d. (across productive units, over time and with respect to
the aggregate shocks) N (0, σ2I ). We set µA = 0, since we are interested in the interaction between rigidities
and idiosyncratic shocks, not in Jensen-inequality-type effects associated with aggregate shocks.
The price-elasticity of demand is η > 1. Aggregate labor is assumed constant and set equal to one. We
define aggregate productivity, At , as:

Z

At =

Bit Litα di,

(17)

R

so that aggregate output, Yt ≡ Yit di, satisfies
Yt = At Kt .
Units adjust with probability λc in every period, independent of their history and of what other units
do that period.16 The parameter that captures microeconomic flexibility is λc . Higher values of λc are
associated with a faster reallocation of workers in response to productivity shocks.
Standard calculations show that the growth rate of output, gY , satisfies:
gY = sA − δ,

(18)

whether unit i adjusts at time t is determined by a Bernoulli random variable ξit with probability of success λc ,
where the ξit ’s are independent across units and over time. This corresponds to the case ω = 1 in Section 2.1.
16 More precisely,

11

where s denotes the savings rate (assumed exogenous) and δ the depreciation rate for capital.
Now compare two economies that differ only in their degree of microeconomic flexibility, λc,1 < λc,2 .
Tedious but straightforward calculations relegated to Appendix B show that:

with

αγ(2 − αγ) 2
σ ,
2(1 − αγ)2

γ = (η − 1)/η, σ2 = σ2I + σ2A .17
We choose parameters to apply (19) as follows: The mark-up is set at 20% (so that γ = 5/6), gY,1 to the
average rate of growth per worker in our sample for the 1980-1990 period, 0.7%, σ = 27%,18 α = 2/3, and
δ = 6%.
Table 9 reports estimated speeds of adjustment across countries. Table 10 reports the average annual
productivity costs of the deviation between each quintile and the bottom quintile in estimated speed of
adjustment. These numbers are large. More important, they imply that moving from the 20th to the 80th
percentile in job security, in countries with strong rule of law, reduces annual productivity growth by 0.86%.
The same change in job security legislation has a much smaller effect on TFP growth, 0.02%, in the group
of economies with weak rule of law.
We are fully aware of the many caveats that such ceteris-paribus comparison can raise, but the point of
the table is to provide an alternative metric of the potential significance of observed levels of effective labor
protection. Moreover, these numbers are roughly consistent with what we obtain when running a regression
of productivity growth on the estimated λc ’s for all the economies in our sample from 1980 to 1990 (see
Table 11 and Figure 2). Focusing on the results controlling for income groups (column 3), the coefficient on
λc is around 0.05 and significant at the 1 percent level. Combining these estimates with those in Column 3
of Table 4 implies that when moving from the 20th to the 80th percentile in job security, annual TFP growth
falls by as much as 1.18% in countries with high rule of law. In contrast, a similar improvement in labor
regulation in countries with low rule law reduces TFP growth by only 0.03%.

Concluding Remarks

Many papers have shown that, in theory, job security regulation depresses firm level hiring and firing decisions. Job security provisions increase the cost of reducing employment and therefore lead to fewer dis17 There

missals when firms are faced with negative shocks. Conversely, when faced with a positive shock, the
optimal employment response takes into account the fact that workers may have to be fired in the future, and
the employment response is smaller. The overall effect is a reduction of the speed of adjustment to shocks.
However, conclusive empirical evidence on the effects of job security regulation has been elusive. One
important reason for this deficit has been the lack of information on employment regulation for a sufficiently
large number of economies that can be integrated to cross sectional data on employment outcomes. In this
paper we have developed a simple empirical methodology that has allowed us to fill some of the empirical gap by exploiting: (a) the recent publication of two cross-country surveys on employment regulations
(Heckman and Pages (2000) and Djankov et al. (2003)) and, (b) the homogeneous data on employment and
production available in the UNIDO dataset. Another important reason for the lack of empirical success is
differences in the degree of regulation enforcement across countries. We address this problem by interacting
the measures of employment regulation with different proxies for law-enforcement.
Using a dynamic labor demand specification we estimate the effects of job security across a sample of
60 countries for the period from 1980 to 1998. We consistently find a relatively lower speed of adjustment
of employment in countries with high legal protection against dismissal, especially when such protection is
likely to be enforced.

A PPENDICES

A Endogeneity of the Gap Measure
The model is the one described in Section 2.1. Ignoring country differences and fixing t,19 we have that
∆e j = ψ j x j ,

(20)

where x j ≡ e∗jt − e j,t−1 and the ψ are i.i.d., independent of the xi , with mean λ and variance ωλ(1 − λ),
0 ≤ ω ≤ 1. It follows from (20) that:
∆e j = λx j + u j ,

(21)

with u j ≡ (ψ j − λ)x j satisfying the properties of an error term in a standard regression setting. Thus, if we
observe the ∆e j and x j and estimate (21), we obtain an unbiased and consistent estimator for λ.20
Removing ∆e from the gap measure is equivalent to replacing x j by z j ≡ x j − ∆e j in (21). It is obvious
that z j = 0 when ψ = 1 and ∆e j = 0 when ψ j = 0. Since the two values ψ j takes in the Calvo case (ω = 1)
are 0 and 1, we have that when estimating the regression coefficient via OLS the covariance in the numerator
will be equal to minus the product of the average of ∆e j and the average of the z j . Since both averages have
the same sign, it follows that the regression coefficient will be negative (or zero if both averages are equal to
zero).
Since we are considering sectoral data, the case ω = 1 may seem somewhat extreme. The following
proposition shows that even for small departures from the partial adjustment case, the bias is likely to be
significant.
Proposition 1 Consider the setting described above. Denote by β̂ the OLS estimate of the cofficient β in
∆e j = const + βz j + error.
Denote by µ and σ2 the (theoretical) mean and variance of the x j ’s. Then:
plimN→∞ β̂ =

(1 − ω)σ2 − ωµ2
λ.
[1 − (1 − ω)λ]σ2 + ωλµ2

(22)

Proof From ∆e j = ψ j x j and z j = (1 − ψ j )x j it follows that:

latter is justified by the fact that most of our identification comes from cross-sectional variation.

Taking expectations over the ψi , conditional on the xi , and letting N tend to infinity leads to:
E[β̂] =

E[ψ(1 − ψ)](σ2 + µ2 ) − λ(1 − λ)µ2
.
E[(1 − ψ)2 ](σ2 + µ2 ) − (1 − λ)2 µ2

The result now follows from the expression above and the fact that:
E[ψ(1 − ψ)] = (1 − ω)λ(1 − λ),
E[(1 − ψ)2 ] = [1 − (1 − ω)λ](1 − λ).
It follows that plimN→∞ β̂ is decreasing in ω, varying from λ/(1 − λ) when ω = 0 to −λµ2 /(σ2 + λµ2 )
when ω = 1. It also follows that plimN→∞ β̂ is decreasing in |µ|, so that:
plimN→∞ β̂ ≤

(1 − ω)λ

1 − (1 − ω)λ

B Gauging the Costs
In this appendix we derive (19). From (18) and (19) it follows that it suffices to show that under the assumptions in Section 4 we have:

(23)

where we have dropped the subindex c from the λ and
θ =

αγ(2 − αγ) 2
(σ + σ2A ),
2(1 − αγ)2 I

(24)

with γ = (η − 1)/η.
The intuition is easier if we consider the following, equivalent, problem. The economy consists of a very
α ,21
large and fixed number of firms (no entry or exit). Production by firm i during period t is Yi,t = Ai,t Li,t
−1/η

while (inverse) demand for good i in period t is Pi,t = Yi,t

, where Ai,t denotes productivity shocks, assumed

to follow a geometric random walk, so that
∆ log Ai,t ≡ ∆ai,t = vtA + vIi,t ,
21 That

is, we ignore hours in the production function.

17

with vtA i.i.d. N (0, σ2A ) and vIi,t i.i.d. N (0, σ2I ). Hence ∆ai,t follows a N (0, σ2T ), with σ2T = σ2A + σ2I . We
assume the wage remains constant throughout.
In what follows lower case letters denote the logarithm of upper case variables. Similarly, ∗ -variables
denote the frictionless counterpart of the non-starred variable.
Solving the firm’s maximization problem in the absence of adjustment costs leads to:

∆li,t

(25)

∆y∗i,t =

(26)

and hence

Denote by Yt∗ aggregate production in period t if there were no frictions. It then follows from (26) that:
∗
Yi,t∗ = eτ∆ai,t Yi,t−1
,

(27)

with τ ≡ 1/(1 − αγ), Taking expectations (over i for a particular realization of vtA ) on both sides of (27) and
noting that both terms being multiplied on the r.h.s. are, by assumption, independent (random walk), yields
1 2 2
A
∗
Yt∗ = eτvt + 2 τ σI Yt−1
,

(28)

Averaging over all possible realizations of vtA (these fluctuations are not the ones we are interested in for the
calculation at hand) leads to

and therefore for k = 1, 2, 3, ...:

1 2 2
∗
Yt∗ = e 2 τ σT Yt−1
,

1 2 2
∗
Yt∗ = e 2 kτ σT Yt−k
.

(29)

Denote:
• Yt,t−k : aggregate Y that would attain in period t if firms had the frictionless optimal levels of labor
corresponding to period t − k. This is the average Y for units that last adjusted k periods ago.
• Yi,t,t−k : the corresponding level of production of firm i in t.
From the expressions derived above it follows that:
Ã
Yi,t,t−1

Yi,t∗

Li,t

= e−αγτ∆ai,t ,

and therefore
∗
Yi,t,t−1 = e∆ai,t Yi,t−1
.

18

Taking expectations (with respect to idiosyncratic and aggregate shocks) on both sides of the latter expres∗ ) yields
sion (here we use that ∆ai,t is independent of Yi,t−1
∗
Yt,t−1 = e 2 σT Yt−1
,
1 2

which combined with (29) leads to:

1
2 2
Yt,t−1 = e 2 (1 − τ )σT Yt∗ .

A derivation similar to the one above, leads to:
∗
Yi,t,t−k = e∆ai,t +∆ai,t−1 +...+∆ai,t−k+1 Yt−k
,

which combined with (29) gives:
Yt,t−k = e−kθYt∗ ,

(30)

with θ defined in (24).
Assuming Calvo-type adjustment with probability λ, we decompose aggregate production into the sum
of the contributions of cohorts:
Yt = λYt∗ + λ(1 − λ)Yt,t−1 + λ(1 − λ)2Yt,t−2 + . . .
Substituting (30) in the expression above yields:
Yt =

λ
Y ∗.
1 − (1 − λ)e−θ t

(31)

It follows that the production gap, defined as:
Prod. Gap ≡
is equal to:
Prod. Gap =

Yt∗ −Yt
,
Yt∗

(1 − λ)(1 − e−θ )
.
1 − (1 − λ)e−θ

(32)

A first-order Taylor expansion then shows that, when |θ| << 1:
Prod. Gap '

(1 − λ)
θ.
λ

(33)

Subtracting this gap evaluated at λ1 from its value evaluated at λ2 , and noting that this gap difference
corresponds to (A2 − A1 )/A1 in the main text, yields (23) and therefore concludes the proof.

Standard errors reported in parentheses. All estimates are significant at the 1% level. All regressions use lagged ∆wict − ∆w·ct as
instrumental variable. As described in the main text, z jct represents the log-change of the nominal marginal productivity of labor
in each sector, minus the country average, divided by one minus the estimated labor share. All regressions includes a country-year
fixed effect (κct in (9)). Income groups are 1: High Income OECD, 2: High Income Non OECD and Upper Middle Income, and 3:
Lower Middle Income and Low Income. Job Security Groups correspond to the highest, middle an lowest third of the measure in

* significant at 10%; ** significant at 5%; *** significant at 1%. Robust standard errors in parentheses. Samplesize determined by availability of TFP data. TFP growth at the country level calculated following Mankiw (1995):
TFP growth = Per-capita GDP growth - 0.3 Per-capita capital growth - 0.5 Avge. Schooling growth. The data
comes from World Penn Tables 5.6 and Barro and Lee (1996). WLS refers to weighted least squares, with
weights inversely proportional to the standard deviation of estimated λc ’s. OLS refers to ordinary least squares.
