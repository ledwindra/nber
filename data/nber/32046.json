    "abstract": "\n\nIn a rational-choice approach to religious conversion, the conversion rate depends on a person\u2019s costs of switching religions and costs of having one\u2019s religion deviate from the type viewed as ideal. The International Social Survey Programme (ISSP) waves for 1991, 1998, 2008, and 2018 allow for calculations of country-wide conversion rates based on religion adherence at the time of each survey and a retrospective question that gauges adherence when the respondent was raised. The analysis applies to 8 types of religion for 58 countries (125 total observations). The rate of conversion depends positively on measures of religious pluralism, negatively on official restrictions that inhibit conversion, negatively on a history of Communism, negatively on real per capita GDP, and positively on years of schooling. These empirical findings accord with predictions from the theoretical framework.\n\n",
