On the Economic Interpretation and
Measurement of Optimal Capacity
Utilization with
Anticipatory Expectat ions

ABSTRACT

This study builds on recent research giving the notion of capacity

utilization clearer economic foundations. In this research optimal output Y
is defined as the minimum point on the firm1s short-run average total cost
curve, and capacity utilization is then computed as CU=Y/Y', where V is actual

output. Here I extend these concepts to include adjustment costs due to
changes in the stock of capital, and nonstatic expectations of future output

demand and input prices. The more general notion of CU is shown to depend on
the shadow values of the firm1s quasi-fixed inputs, and is decomposed to

isolate the effects of anticipatory expectations. An empirical comparison is
then made between traditional indices and alternative economic CU measures,

using annual U.S. manufacturing data 1954-80. The calculated indices exhibit
plausible patterns, which can be interpreted as the effects of nonstatic
expectations and adjustment costs.

Introduction

The rate of capacity utilization is a very common index of cyclical

variation. Several measures of capacity utilization (hereafter, Cu) exist,
mostly based on peak-to-peak interpolation or survey information. Until
recently, turning points of these CU measures tended to correspond closely
to other typical cyclical indicators such as labor productivity and Tobin's q.

However, since the 1973 energy price shocks the various measures have
increased in volatility, and although still procyclical, they have not

exhibited the strong interrelationships observed earlier. This raises the
issue of whether past relationships among these indicators still hold.

Such a question is, however, difficult to answer with traditional cyclical

measures, since for the most part they are not based on an explicit
economic structure.

In this paper I demonstrate that movements in certain cyclical measures -—

particularly

capacity utilization --

are

not random but can be viewed as system-

atic results of a rational economic optimization process undertaken by the firm,

characterized by the type of general dynamic otimization framework discussed
in Morrison (1982). Specifically, I develop a general approach for determining
an economic CU measure that is closely related to the shadow value of fixed

inputs such as capital. Since these measures are calculated within an economic
optimization framework, they depend explicitly on the existing economic struc-

ture and exogenous variables. Hence they provide more useful i.nterpretble
information than is generated by traditional measures.

The CU measure is related to the notion of capacity output *

discussed

earlier by Cassels (1937), B, Hickman (1964) and others, and defined as the

—3—

level of output which minimizes short run average total costs (SRAC). The
CU ratio is then defined as \1/'f*, where V is observed output. Trends in Cu

reflect variations in utilization of the firm's quasi-fixed inputs such as

capital. This suggests a close theoretical relationship with investment
analysis and thus Tobin's q, as well as with single-factor productivity
indicators such as that for labor.
Static models cannot adequately explain these cyclical phenomena,

because they do not recognize the importance of gradual movements in input

stocks. Dynamic models, however, are useful since they are based on costs
of adjustment for quasi-fixed inputs that induce slow adjustment by firms

to "optimal" or "desired" levels of the quasi—fixed inputs. Within a
dynamic framework, firms move along a given short run average total cost
(SRAC) curve, and also shift their SRAC curves by optimally investing in

quasi-fixed inputs. This dynamic optimizing behavior has implications for
movements in CU since Y is determined by the position of the SRAC curve.
The principal goals of this paper are therefore (i) to develop a
conceptual framework for understanding cyclical movements in CU, and (ii)
to illustrate these phenomena empirically by providing econometric
estimates based on alternative CU specifications.

I proceed as follows.

In Section II, generalizing from a dynamic model in the tradition of Lucas
(1967), Treadway (1970), Fuss (1976), Berndt, Fuss and Waverman (1979) and
Morrison and Berndt (1981), I graphically consider how alternative
assumptions about expectations formation and other structural phenomena

have differing implications for CU measurement. In Section III I provide
further interpretation by developing a more formal analytical derivation of

the model. In Section IV I illustrate these results empirically, Finally,
in Section V I present concluding remarks.

II. A Diagrammatic Analysis of CU with Static and Nonstatic Expectations
The geometric representation of CU with static expectations is

straightforward. Following Morrison and Berndt (1981) (hereafter M-B),
assume that the firm's technology can be represented by a quadratic
normalized variable cost function G with long run constant returns to
scale,
(2.1)

G=L+PEE+PMM =

+cEtPEt+aMtPMt)+VK+.5(yKVK/Y)+y(K/Y))+(EVPEK+yMVPMK+aVtKt
where capital (K) is the quasi-fixed input, labor (L), energy (E), and

non-energy materials (M) are variable inputs, E and

are corresponding

variable input prices normalized by L' and where net investment (K)
incorporates internal costs of adjustment.

Within this framework, one can specify how *

(that

level of output at

which SRAC is minimized) is affected by changes in exogenous variables.
Specifically, \'* can be derived explicitly by differentiating average total

costs (average variable costs plus average fixed costs) with respect to Y

and solving for * as the minimum point on this SRAC curve (see Figure 1).
This yields

where UK is the (normalized) one period user cost of capital services.
Note that changes in exogenous input prices can shift the SRAC to the right
(increasing y*), to the left (decreasing Y*), or upward (without affecting
y*)

Under the assumption of static expectations, the above CU measure has
been derived and estimated by Berndt, Morrison and Watkins (1981) and

Berndt (1980). An interesting feature of their empirical results is that
while the CU measure has plausible directional changes, it is always

greater than one, implying that actual output Y is always greater than *

as in Figure 1. This is consistent with a perennial capacity shortage in
that it is always optimal to reduce unit costs by increasing K. Such a
curious result could be due to failure to account for nonstatic expectations,
since with no forward-looking expectations the growing firm is always behind
in capital stock formation, resulting in perpetually observed 'catch-up"

investment. This illustrates the dependence of CU measurement on assumptions
concerning expectations formation.

In order to analyze the effects of nonstatic expectations diagramaticlly,
it is useful first to comment on why investment occurs. At an equilibrium
point, the firm's capital shadow valuation (its net value in terms of reduced
variable costs) equals the exogenous market rental price of capital UK. Suppose,

however, that output demand increased. In such a case, due to the increased
potential profitability of an incremental unit of K, the shadow value of K
(hereafter, ZK) would exceed UK• Thus, in maximizing the present value of long

run profits, the firm would face incentives to increase investment, shifting its

SRAC curve to the right until the new ZK equalled

UK.

Now consider the case of certain but nonstatic expectations. In order
to determine its optimal current investment, the firm must take into

consideration the entire future time paths of exogenous variables such as

input prices, output or demand. As a very simple example, consider a
cost-minimizing firm at time t0 expecting with perfect certainty a
permanent upward shift in market output demand at time t1, with all other

exogenous variables remaining constant for all time. Denote the optimal
long-run capital stock under increased output demand as K*1. With no
adjustment costs, K would increase from K*0 (corresponding to the original
demand curve) to K*1 instantaneously at time t., implying an infinite rate

of investment at that time. With adjustment costs, however, the demand
shift would not be accommodated as quickly. Rather, the firm's investment
rate will increase immediately from that rate optimal under static
expectations for all exogenous variables, to a larger current rate for all

time periods T, t0 < T < t1. Hence, unlike static expectations, where the
adjustment process would commence at t1, anticipatory expectations imply
that the firm will approach K*1 gradually, beginning at to.
An implication is that in such a case optimal current investment for

all T, t0 < T <

t1,

is greater than the optimal investment based only on

currently observed exogenous variables. Further, the present value of
incremental current expenses associated with increased current investment
would be less than the present value costs associated with the accelerated
investment
shift;

at

t1

if

there

were no anticipation of the demand

in terms of present value optimization the firm benefits from

The above discussion illustrates a point on intertemporal optimization

-8-

and desired capital stocks made by Nickell (1978):
instead of the firm aiming at a simple 'desired' capital stock
K*, it aims at the desired capital stock for the next period plus
an exponential weighted sum of the difference between the desired
capital stock next period and the different desired capital stocks
for all future periods."
Morrison (l983a) has developed Nickell 's notion further, and has derived
the corresponding investment equation having the form:

(2.4) I(t)xK(t)xK*(t)+(1/Gfe5t)((GKK+rGK)((K*(s)K*(t))+Gp(s)
+

r

v(cr

where K*(s) is the "desired' capital stock defined for prices and demand
levels at time s, Y(s) is expected output, r is the constant real rate of
return, P is a vector of expected input prices,

are the second partial

derivatives of the quadratic cost function (2.1), and X

is

the partial

adjustment parameter.

It is clear from (2.4) that if all exogenous variables were expected to
be constant, K*(s)=K*(t)=K*, implying that (2.4) would reduce to the standard

flexible accelerator model. In general, however, while the current optimal

capital stock is given by K*(t), the present va1ue-maximizing target" stock
level is K**(t)=K*(t)+J(t), where J(t) represents the incremental current
capital stock due to anticipatory expectations.
The terms of shadow values, given an anticipated output demand increase,
the shadow value of capital ZK at t0 is equal to the current static marginal
value given all exogenous variables, plus the possible extra discounted net
revenue provided by the incremental demand at t1. Thus ZK at time t0 is
larger with anticipatory than with static expectations, consistent with a
difference between K** and K* and encouraging extra anticipatory investment
between t0 and t1 .

Conversely, if reductions in future output demand were

anticipated, ZK based on nonstatic expectations would be smaller than that
based on static expectations.

With anticipatory investment behavior, therefore, the firm's SRAC curve
and its corresponding optimal capacity output and implied CU ratio will

differ from that based on static expectations. To consider CU derivation
with anticipatory expectations, assume that before time t0 the firm was in

long run equilibrium with exogenous Y equal to capacity output Y. Then,
as above, at time t0 the firm learns that at t1 output demand will increase.
Because of the induced additional investment at all t, t0 < -u < t1, the

new current capital stock will position a SRAC curve at time r which reaches

a minimum to the right of the current exogenous output level, V (see Figure 1).
T

Since the current-valued diagram indicates V <

*, there

appears to be

current excess capacity with an associated CU rate of less than unity.
However, the position of the SRAC curve in such a case reflects results of
a present value optimizing decision, and thus the current exogenous output

must in a present value sense be optimal. This demonstrates that a
current measure of CU may diverge from unity in the short run even when the
firm

is

at a true intertemporal optimum.

The definition of the relevant CU measure in this case is not
immediately clear. If capacity output \1** were defined in present value
terms to reflect the future path of output levels, then with perfect

expectations y** and V would always coincide, and CU would always be

unity. In such a case the difference between V and * would be
interpreted as representing the impact on capacity output of nonstatic

expectations. This is in direct contrast to the case of static expectations,

where any divergence between Y and * cannot be entirely attributed to

-10-

previous shocks that were not expected and thus must be accommodated ex post.

Complexities arise when anticipatory expectations are imperfect. In
such cases, the divergence between V and \I* cannot be entirely attributed

to the effects of perfect anticipatory expectations. Instead, a portion of
this divergence could be attributed to previous errors in expectations,
analogous to the static expectations case where an unanticipated change
occurs.

shock in one exogenous variable. In reality the paths of several exogenous
variables will be changing over time, and not all changes will be

permanent. This greatly complicates the analysis.
While such multiple influences cause interpretation of actual observed
CU measures to be ambiguous, in the next section I show that it is possible
in general to isolate the effect on capacity output of investment toward

K** rather than toward K*. This facilitates interpretation of, for
example, low current-valued CU measures in terms of whether they are due to
optimistic anticipatory investment behavior or inadequate levels of current
output demand.

III. CU Measurement: Further Analysis
The discussion in the previous section considered CU measurement under

simplified assumptions. In order to generalize the analysis, it is useful
to introduce the notion of the firm's shadow cost function.2 The shadow cost
function is simply the total cost function with the contribution of capital
assessed at its shadow value ZK rather than at its market value

UK.

I first

—11 —

consider

the case of static expectations and constant returns to scale.

Given the normalized cost function G, the shadow cost function can
be characterized by
(3.1)

G(Y,PtKK) +

ZKK,

where K is the current level of capital .

Assuming adjustment costs occur

only for net investment, and that G is a 'static" short run cost function
without K, Lau (1976) has shown that the shadow value equals the negative
of the partial derivative of G with respect to K, denoted _GK.
In the case discussed here, where the dynamics of the firm's behavior
are represented by K in the variable cost function, the contribution of K

must also be recognized. More specifically, the shadow value of K must
include not only the reduction in variable costs associated with one more
unit

of capital, but also the cost of putting the capital in place —— the

increased cost of investment. This "net' shadow value ZKK = _(GKK + GK)
is similar to the notion of marginal efficiency of investment, whereas the
"gross" shadow value of ZKK =

_GKK more closely represents the marginal

efficiency of capital. Note also that in temporary equilibrium KO; K must
be taken into account in the derivation of CUsince it is incorporated into
the SRAC curve. Thus (3.1) becomes

(3.2)

G(Y,P1,t,K,K) - GKK -

GK.

An interesting feature of the shadow cost function is that with long
run CRTS, the firm is always producing at the minimum of the short run
average shadow cost (hereafter, SRACSH) curve, simply because this curve
characterizes a notional long run equilibrium where ZK is the effective

"price" of K. Thus the deviation of shadow from total costs characterizes
the divergence between temporary and long run equilibrium. If shadow costs

—12—

are set equal to total costs, the minima of the two corresponding average
cost functions are forced to coincide, and there will be no incentive for

the firm to move from that point. The equilibrium condition for the firm
can be restated, given this interpretation, as

(3.3)

G(.) -

or

-(GKK +

=

Since (3.3) imposes long run equilibrium, it can characterize the
stationary point alternatively as (i) the optimal K* level given Y, or
(ii) the capacity '(

level

given K.

The above procedure for deriving 'f as that level of V which sets
UKK = _(GKK + GkK)K differs from that noted at the beginning of Section II,

where * was defined as the output level at which SRAC was minimized. It
is easy, however, to demonstrate their equivalence. Using the form for G
from (2.1) and imposing _(GKK +

G<K)

=

uKK,

=

(3.4)

(3.5)

results in

uKK, implying

=

_(YKKK2+Yk2)1(aK+YEKPE+YMKPMKtt+UKK).

Hence it is clear that *

in

(3.5) equals * from (2.2).

This geometric interpretation of *

is

illustrated in Figure II.

Assume the firm is at a temporary equilibrium position at ooint B with
short run increasing average costs characterized by SRACQ(Ko,Ko,uK) and

output Y1; let the associated LRAC curve be LRACQ. As a consequence of,
say, a previous unexpected increase in exogenous output demand, V1 is

larger than the output level V0 corresponding to the minimum point on the

current SRACQ curve. Resoecifying the total cost curve in terms of the
shadow value of K, given K0, K0, and Y0, repositions the 'effective" curve

—l 3—

as SRACSH. Since ZK exceeds UK, capital is a binding constraint and more
capital and investment is desired to reach SRAC*(K*,uK).

Recall that if one imposes the equilibrium adjustment condition
uKK = _(GKK + GkK), either K or V could be adjusted. If K were allowed

to adjust to the implied value consistent with a given steady state V1
level, K* could be determined simply as that amount of K at which the
new, lower SRACSH curve would be tangent with LRAC0 at Y1 (see Doint C

on Figure II), thereby defining SRAC*(K*,uK). Obviously at point C the
CU ratio is unity. If, however, K were held fixed at K0 and output were
altered to equate uKK and _(GKK + GkK), the firm's production level would
decline from V1 to Y0, and costs would fall as the firm "slid" back along
the SRMC0 curve from D until they reached the tangency with LRAC0 at

point A. Again, at A output V0 would equal *, CU=l, and there would be
no incentive for the firm to alter its behavior.

A useful adaptation of this structure is to relax the assumption of
CRIS. Under nonconstant returns to scale (hereafter, NCRTS), capacity

output *, defined as that level of output at which short-run and long-run
average cost curves are tangent, no longer ocurs at the minimum point of

the SRAC curve. Derivation of * from the shadow cost relationship (3.6)
is, however, straightforward and analogous to that outlined above.
I now can construct the CU representations alluded to in Section II.
Recall that with anticipatory investment K* in general differs from K**.
Now denote the capacity output level corresponding with investment toward
K** as V**; when the corresponding K calculation is purged of the antici-

patory behavior J (see 2.4)) the resulting Y* can be compared with **

to

delineate the impact of nonstatic expectations.

Thus, the relevant CU measure accounting for intertemporal optimization and
anticipatory expectations involves comparison of actual output Y with **;

the effect of anticipatory expectations can then be isolated by comparing
the resulting CU measure to 'y'/f*

Empirical

Illustrati

In this section I present empirical illustrations of alternative
annual CU measures for U.S. manufacturing, l954-8O. A dynamic factor

demand model based on the quadratic normalized variable cost function
(3.7) with NCRTS was estimated under three alternative assumptions concerning expectations formations for input prices and output quantity:
(i) static expectations, (ii) adaptive expectations, and (iii) general

expectations, the last of which is less restrictive than (ii) and is

consistent with 'partial rationality." Additional details on the esti
mation and specification of these various models can be found in Morrison
(1982 or 1983a).

Given the parameter estimates from these models, a number of alter-

native CU measures have been calculated from (3.9). First, as alluded
to in the previous section, the calculation of capacity output is affected

by whether the model is based on static or dynamic optimization. Inclusion
of GkK reduces the "gross shadow value" of the capital stock _GKK to a "net"

shadow value _(GKK +

GK),

which incorporates the dynamic or flow nature

of the firm's adjustment problem --

the costsincurred by moving to a

new level of capacity. Thus, the corresponding net CU measure CU (based
on the net shadow value of K) is likely to be closer to unity than the

gross CU measure

between CU and

the

(based on the gross shadow value of K). The deviation
isolates the impact of the dynamics of the model --

adjustment costs -- on CU measurement, and therefore provides a basis

for useful comparison.

Second, the effects of anticipatory behavior in the nonstatic expec-

tations models is identified by comparing the CU measure based on

-16-

predicted anticipatory investment toward K** (y/y**, denoted CUCV) with
that based on predicted investment were expectations static and were the

capital target" K* rather than K** (y/y*, denoted CUp). As postulated
in the previous section, in an expanding economy current investment including that based on anticipated changes in exogenous variables would likely
be greater than that warranted by current-valued variables, resulting in a
CU\/ measure below unity even if present value optimization behavior is

correct. The impact of anticipatory behavior is purged from the CU

calculation. CU should therefore be closer to unity than CU,, since
behavior which is not based on currently observed conditions is not

attributed to current exogenous variables. Deviations in CU from unity
are interpreted as being due to the effects of discrepancies between
previous expected and realized exogenous variables rather than to optimal
forward-looking behavior.

In Table 1 I present four alternative series that in various ways

replicate current known procedures for calculating CU. Specifically, in
the first two columns I present traditional, mechanical CU measures as
computed by the Federal Reserve Board (FRB, column 1) and Wharton (column

2). Both measures exhibit annual values whose level is always less than
unity. Both show drops in the recessionary years of 1958, 1960-61,
1970-71, and 1974-75, and increases in subsequent years. The FRB measure
is highest in 1966, while Wharton peaks in 1973; other strong" years for
FRB include 1955 and 1973, and correspondingly good years for Wharton are

1955 and 1969. The differences between Wharton and FRB indices are
nontrivial; the simple correlation between them over this time period is
only .605, suggesting that further analysis could be useful

-17-

In columns three and four of Table 1 I present alternative economic

measures of CU based on static expectations; the CU measure in column 3 is
computed following the procedures of Berndt, Morrison, and Watkins, while
the CU9 measure in column 4 ignores costs of investment in the shadow value
of ZKK.

A number of patterns in Table 1 are worth noting. First, as expected,

CU9 tends to exceed CUR. The difference between CU and CU9 is, however,
relatively small, indicating only a marginal impact of adjustment costs on

observed capacity utilization. The difference in levels is largest in the
strong investment years of 1965 and 1966 when adjustment costs were
largest, but the trends are analogous and reflect the peaks and troughs

represented by the traditional measures. Both CU and CU9 exceed unity for
most of the sample period, implying a current shortage of capacity. This
tendency is, however, not as pervasive for CUn as for indices based on
earlier data sets, such as those reported in Berndt, Morrison, and Watkins
[1981].

As was noted earlier, this predominance of large CU measures may
partially reflect neglect of the impact of anticipated future paths of

exogenous variables on the firm's current investment behavior. To assess
this conjecture further, in Table 2 I present CU estimates based on two

expectations assumptions -- adaptive and general nonstatic

alternative

expectations. Only CU estimates are reported since CU is the measure
consistent

with the dynamic model specification and since the relationship

between CU9 and CU for the nonstatic expectations formulations is closely
analogous to that discussed for the static expectations model. The entries
in columns 1 and 2 are

and

those in columns 3 and 4 are CU and
expectations, respectively,

for adaptive expectations, while
for general nonstatic

The entries in columns 1
measures

indicate

and 3 confirm

a priori conjectures; the

that in general by current-valued criteria, CU is less

than unity, implying that considerable excess capacity exists. Note that
both these

indices reach minimum values near the beginning and end of

the sample period, and drop significantly during slack years such as 1958,
1961, 1975, and 1980, although the 1971 drop in the traditional indices is

reflected in 1970 for the general framework. Also, the general expectations
measure tends to be slightly more volatile, lower during the first and last
part of the sample and higher in the middle, than that based on adaptive

expectations. In terms of the 'boom' years, the CU measures for the
general and adaptive expectations models attain maximal values in 1972 and
1974, respectively, whereas the Wharton and FRB measures peaked in 1973 and

1966, respectively. Other smaller "peaks" in 1955, 1959-60 and 1969 are
captured by both the traditional and the economic indices.

By contrast with the CU measures, the entries in columns 2 and 4 for

CU are in most cases greater than unity. This is particularly evident in
the mid-range of the sample where the general expectations index indicates
near-optimal present valued behavior; this implies that almost all observed

deviations from capacity can be attributed to anticipatory behavior. Significantly, however, departures from unity are largest in the recessionary

years of 1958, 1975, and 1980. The adaptive expectations index in this case
is more volatile; it indicates larger variations from the optimum, including
a relatively substantial shortfall in economic capacity in present value

terms in the mid 1960's and early 1970's. The adaptive expectations framework may provide preferable estimates here, for it can better distinguish
between deviations in CU due to earlier errors given quasi-fixed inputs

and those due to nonstatic expectations formation, Specifically, since the

—21 -

expectations

parameters in the general expectations formation are composite

parameters, they may capture all deviations, allowing little role for other

"disequilibrium" factors. Relative variations such as drops in 1958, 197071 and 1975, and "highs" in 1955 and 1973 are, however, still evident in
both measures.

The prevalence of values that exceed unity in these indices suggest
that evidence of chronic excess capacity is largely due to the neglect of

anticipatory behavior. Since the CU measures purge the current investment induced by nonstatic expectations, they more closely correspond to CU
measures based on current exogenous variables, and thus to those measures
based on the assumption of static expectations (see columns 2 and 4 of

Table 2, and columns 3 and 4 of Table 1). The nonstatic expectations
framework appears, however, to capture periods of excess capacity more

effectively even with the present valued measure; the cu measures more

often fall short of unity than do the CU and CU indices in Table 1.
Overall, the results are consistent with the notion that in earlier

years in the sample when CU was less than unity there was great optimism,
which in retrospect was unwarranted; evidenceof excess available capacity
appears even in present value terms. In the 1960's, demand was sufficiently
strong to utilize most of the excess capacity, and in fact created a shortage
of capacity during 1963-67 when investment responded less quickly than it

should have. By the late 1970's the pattern returned to that observed in
the 1950's; substantial excess capacity existed due to unwarranted optimism.
Finally, it is of interest to compare the economic Cu measure with the

traditional mechanical FRB and Wharton CU indices. As seen at the bottom of
Tables 1 and 2, the simple correlation between the cu measures suggest that

the economic CU indices, except CU for the static expectations model, better

—22-.

approximate the FRB measure than Wharton. Simple correlations of the CU
measures for the adaptive and general expectations model with the FRB, for
example, are .212 and .229, respectively, in contrast to .117 and .026 for

Wharton. The .456 correlation between the static expectations CU measure
and FRB, however, is the largest for any static expectations model

,

whereas

for Wharton the corresponding correlation is .195. This implies that the
gross shadow value measure better approximates the FRB measure than does the

net measure. Another surprising but interesting tendency is for the CU
measures to more closely approximate the traditional measures -- even though
they exceed unity -- than CU with nonstatic expectations incorporated.

The CU measures for the general and adaptive expectations measures have
correlations of .644 and .705, respectively, with the FRB measure; these
correlations are substantially higher than that between the two traditional

measures. The tendency for the CU9 measures to have higher correlations with
FRB than the CU measure holds also for the nonstatic expectations models.
Together these patterns suggest that the current mechanical CU measures are
best envisaged as corresponding to no anticipatory behavior and no adjust*

ment costs.
Concluding Remarks

The purpose of this study has been to emphasize the importance of
economic foundations for the construction of cyclical economic indicators.
More specifically, the derivation of CU measures within an economic framework links capacity utilization measurement to other economic indicators

such as the shadow value of capital and multifactor productivity. A
common theoretical framework facilitates interpretation and application
of the measures.

-23-

Specifically, the CU analysis presented here has been based on equating
the shadow and market values of capital, and calculating the implied capacity
output (**, which is then compared with the current level of output demand Y.

This output "disequilibrium is closely related to the idea of Tobin's q,
an investment indicator based on the deviation between an implicit and market

value of capital. The economic CU measures are therefore consistent with

theories of investment. In this sense, choice among the various economic CU
measures is equivalent to choice among alternative assumptions concerning

investment behavior. By contrast, while the mechanical FRB and Wharton
measures are often used as regressors in investment equations, their mechanical
construction cannot be expected to be logically consistent with theories of
I nvestrnent.

Interpretation of deviations of CU from unity as being due to fixed input
constraints also has implications for the purging of cyclical variations

from productivity measures. Specifically, use of the mechanical CU measures
as an adjustment for short run disequilibrium in productivity measurement has
long been questioned because of its lack of theoretical underpinnings.

Morrison (1983) has shown that both primal an dual productivity measures can
be adjusted by a corresponding economic CU measure to remove the short run

effects of quasi-fixity of inputs. This approach has the attractive feature
of allowing identification of shifts in production possibility frontiers
(utruel productivity changes) from movements along it (the effect of short
run constraints on adjustment or "disequilibrium").

In sum, the interpretation of cyclical economic phenomena is enhanced
by the formal derivation of economic indicators such as CU within an

explicit optimization framework. Moreover, the implications from such an
exercise provide a useful basis for further theoretical and empirical work
on the analysis of fluctuations in economic activity.

Footnotes

In contrast, with static expectations the firm will not attempt to adjust
until the shock takes place at time t, but then must adjust slowly because of
costs of adjustment. It is thus optimizing over this time period in terms of
current expectations, but not in an overall present value sense as seen from
time to. For further discussion see Morrison (1982), Essay 2.
