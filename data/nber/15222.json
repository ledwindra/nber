    "abstract": "\n\nWe introduce a \"bad environment-good environment\" technology for consumption growth in a consumption- based asset pricing model.  Using the preference structure from Campbell and Cochrane (1999), the model generates realistic time-varying volatility, skewness and kurtosis in fundamentals while still permitting closed-form solutions for asset prices.  The model not only fits standard salient asset prices features including means and volatilities for equity returns and risk free rates, but also generates a realistic variance premium and option prices.\n\n",
