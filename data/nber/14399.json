    "abstract": "\n\nThe debate between \"structural\" and \"reduced-form\" approaches has generated substantial controversy in applied economics.  This article reviews a recent literature in public economics that combines the advantages of reduced-form strategies -- transparent and credible identification -- with an important advantage of structural models -- the ability to make predictions about counterfactual outcomes and welfare. This recent work has developed formulas for the welfare consequences of various policies that are functions of high-level elasticities rather than deep primitives.  These formulas provide theoretical guidance for the measurement of treatment effects using program evaluation methods.  I present a general framework that shows how many policy questions can be answered by identifying a small set of sufficient statistics.  I use this framework to synthesize the modern literature on taxation, social insurance, and behavioral welfare economics.  Finally, I discuss topics in labor economics, industrial organization, and macroeconomics that can be tackled using the sufficient statistic approach.\n\n",
