    "abstract": "\n\nWe estimate \ufb01nancial institutions\u2019 portfolio tilts that relate to stocks\u2019 environmental, social, and governance (ESG) characteristics. In 2021, ESG-related tilts total 6% of the investment industry\u2019s assets and average 22% of institutions\u2019 total portfolio tilts. ESG tilts are larger for less-volatile stocks and for institutions with smaller size and greater active share, consistent with our theoretical predictions. Significant ESG tilts arise from the choice of stocks held and, especially, the weights on stocks held. The largest institutions tilt increasingly toward green stocks, while other institutions and households tilt increasingly brown. UNPRI signatories and European institutions tilt greener, banks browner.\n\n",
