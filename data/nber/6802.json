Several striking conclusions emerge.  In relatively centralized labor markets employment and output are decreasing and inflation is initially increasing and then decreasing in the degree of central bank conservatism.  A radical-populist central banker who cares not at all about inflation (alternatively, who is not conservative) maximizes social welfare.  Economic performance is not U-shaped in the degree of centralization of the labor market, in contrast to conventional wisdom.\n\n",
