    "abstract": "\n\nWe study the relationship between water nutrient pollution and U.S. agriculture using data between the early 1970s and late 2010s. We estimate a positive causal effect of corn acreage on nitrogen concentration in the country\u2019s water bodies using alternative empirical approaches. We find that a 10% increase in corn acreage causes an increase in nitrogen concentration in water by at least 1% and show that the magnitude of the acreage effect increases with precipitation but not with extreme temperature. Based on the average streamflow of the Mississippi River at the Gulf of Mexico during this period and damages of about $16 per kilogram of nitrogen, this 1% increase in average nitrogen concentration implies an annual external cost of $800 million. We also report the results of additional integrated-assessment type of exercises aimed to inform policy makers, and we use recent climate models to project the implications of climate change on the magnitude of the estimated effects. We estimate that climate change will not materially change the relationship between corn acreage and nitrogen concentration in waterways\n\n",
