An Input-Output Model of the U.S. Economy with Pollution Externality
Nicholas Z. Muller
NBER Working Paper No. 22092
March 2016
JEL No. C67,Q53,Q56
ABSTRACT
Input-output (I-O) analysis represents the flows of goods and services within the market.
Environmentally-extended I-O (EEIO) models include flows of both pollution and consumption
of resources and energy. The present paper proposes a conceptual structure for EEIO accounts
that builds on the work of Leontief (1970) and Hendrickson, Lave, and Matthews (2006), and
then estimates empirical EEIO accounts for the U.S. economy in 1999 and 2011. The empirical
accounts provide the first complete characterization of the air pollution damage flows throughout
the U.S. economy. Pollution intensity fell from 7 percent of value-added in 1999 to 2 percent in
2011. The utility sector exhibits the highest ratio of pollution damage from value-added
production to supply chain damage; this ratio was 22 in 1999 and 54 in 2011. About one-half of
all damage comes from intermediate demand, one-third from household consumption, and about
7 percent each from fixed investment and government use of commodities. In both 1999 and
2011, damages would have been about 7 percent higher had all imports been made domestically.
The damages from exported goods nearly doubled from 5 percent to almost 10 percent of total
pollution damage.

Introduction.
Input-output (I-O) analysis explores the inter-dependencies among the different sectors
of an economic system. While traditional I-O modeling represents the flows of goods
and services within the market, environmentally-extended I-O (EEIO) models include
flows of both residuals (pollution) and consumption of resources and energy. Many
EEIO models exist (see reviews in European Union Joint Regulatory Centre, 2006, and
Ronald E. Miller and Peter D. Blair, 2006). While the earliest conceptual augmentation is
credited to Wassily Leontief (1970), importantly, the most prominent empirical work in
this area models physical accounts. That is, EEIO models are used to explore the flows
of emissions of pollutants and use of (energy-bearing) resources (Lester B. Lave et al.,
1995; Christopher T. Hendrickson et al., 1998; Henderson, Lave, and H. Scott Matthews,
2006). Only two early examples of value-based EEIO modeling, using data now 23 years
old, exist (Matthews and Lave, 2001; Matthews, 2000).
The present paper strives to contribute to this field by estimating the first economywide EEIO model for the United States (U.S.) economy reported in monetary terms
using state-of-the-art economic and environmental modeling techniques. Specifically,
this analysis develops an EEIO model for air pollution over all sectors of the U.S.
economy that reports (monetary) external costs for 1999 and 2011. This facilitates a
complete characterization of the monetary damage flows from air pollution within the
U.S. economy inclusive of both intermediate and final demand. Capitalizing on the
information in the market I-O accounts reported by the U.S. Bureau of Economic
2

Analysis (USBEA), the damages associated with production from each sector that is
targeted for exports, private fixed investment, changes in physical inventories and
government consumption are also reported.
The move from physical accounts to value, or monetary, accounts is a significant step
forward. In the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPAs), the weights affixed to
output of various goods and services in the economy are their market prices. Intuitively,
different prices are attributed to different goods. In properly constructed
environmentally augmented accounts, the weights applied to pollution emissions are
their marginal damages (see William D. Nordhaus, 2006 or Katherine G. Abraham and
Christopher Mackie, 2006). Analogously to market goods, prices affixed to emissions
should reflect their value. Prior research indicates that the monetary damage of
emissions for local pollutants varies considerably according to the source location
(Nicholas Z. Muller and Robert O. Mendelsohn, 2009; Neal Fann et al., 2009; Paul Y.
Kerl et al., 2015). As such, emissions of different pollutants, or of the same pollutant
discharged in different locations, are effectively different goods (or bads, as the case
may be). This suggests using source-and-pollutant-specific marginal damages as “prices”
or weights. Such an approach appropriately values various emissions in the aggregate
EEIO accounts 1. The variance in damages (across sources of the same pollutant) also
suggests that physical accounts which implicitly attribute equal weight to all emissions
may yield biased environmental accounts. The use of marginal damages for valuation
This is an important distinction from the one or two examples of monetary EEIO papers in the literature
which used national average “prices” because of the dearth of models available at the time that could
estimate source-and-pollutant-specific marginal damages.

has the additional virtue that this strategy most closely reflects the approach used in
developing the market accounts. And, if the goal is a synthesis of market and
environmental accounting structures, this isomorphism in method is especially helpful.
Estimating monetary EEIO accounts is also preferred because it facilitates a more direct
or complete augmentation of the market accounts. Simply put: monetary EEIO models
are expressed in the same units as the market accounts. As such, their direct inclusion
into a fully augmented system of accounts is feasible. The physical accounts must
remain separate or distinct from the market accounts because they are expressed in
terms of tons, cords, barrels, BTUs, or some other physical unit of measure.
There are, of course, costs associated with the use of monetary EEIO methods. Perhaps
the most important is the introduction of uncertainty. This manifests most clearly in two
areas: the impact of exposure to environmental pollutants on various human health
states, and the monetary value attributed to the changes in the risk of such health
impacts occurring. While the uncertainty introduced by pursuing value accounts is
significant (see United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), 2011 for a
characterization of the effects of different modeling choices on the benefits of air
pollution control) all is not lost. That is, the two sources of uncertainty noted above
effect the level of damage estimates, not the relative damage of emissions across sectors,
industries, or sources (Muller, 2011). This occurs because both the functions that relate
exposure to impact and impact to money are applied multiplicatively and uniformly
across emitting sources. As such, the “relative damage” uncertainty cancels out.
4

Armed with monetary EEIO estimates, the paper presents a complete accounting of air
pollution value flows throughout the economy. To begin, damages are estimated from
value-added production. Using steel manufacturing as an example, pollution from
value-added production is that which escapes the smokestack at the site of production
as the various inputs to production are combined to make output. This is the most
intuitive form of pollution. The second category involves external costs associated with
the production of inputs that are then used in a given sector’s production processes. So,
continuing with the steel manufacturing example, this approach tabulates the damages
from coal mining, electric power generation, railroad transport, and all of the other
factors of production used by steel manufacturers (aside from labor and fixed capital).
Third, the analysis inverts the previous classification by computing the pollution
damage due to all other sectors’ use of output by a given sector. This tack, in the context
of steel production, totals up the damage from every sectors’ use of manufactured steel
as inputs to their production processes. Fourth, the pollution damage due to
consumption of output by households is calculated. Finally, pollution damages are
estimated for net exports, private fixed investment, and changes to inventories. It is
critical to note that the above categories of pollution damage are not mutually exclusive
and are not aggregated.
While the approach discussed above computes levels of pollution damage, perhaps
equally important is that this approach enables several new ways to model the
pollution intensity of production and consumption. Calculating pollution intensity is

5

paramount because it facilitates cross-sectional and inter-temporal comparisons of
pollution damage. Prior authors reported a standard measure of damage intensity
either expressed in terms of damage-per-unit value-added or gross output (Muller,
Nordhaus, Mendelsohn, 2011; Muller, 2014a). The present analysis reports this and
additional intensity constructs. Akin to Hendrickson, Lave, and Matthews, (2006) this
analysis computes the ratio of damage produced by a sector coming from value-added
production relative to cumulative emissions produced in the supply-chain. Next, this
paper reports the ratio of the cumulative externality due to other industries’ use of each
sector’s commodities as inputs to production to total damage, by sector. Damages from
household consumption of each sector’s output are also calculated. This value is
expressed relative to value-added damage and damages due to other sectors’ use of
commodities as inputs. The analysis also compares the damage intensity of exports and
avoided domestic damage from imports.
As stated above, the empirical analysis conducted herein differs from most, if not all,
prior EEIO models (Leontief, 1970; 1985; Lave et al., 1995; Hendrickson et al., 1998;
Hendrickson, Lave, Matthews, 2006). As such a brief description of the exercises
conducted is presented here with a more detailed discussion in section III. The analysis
relies on several publicly available databases published by the USBEA. First, the “Use”
table, which reports a sectoral breakdown of commodity use and industry output in
nominal terms, is employed to obtain an annual glimpse of the flows of goods and
services within the market boundary. (In contrast, most earlier research in

6

environmental I-O used the “Direct Input Requirements” tables, which depicts the
value of inputs required to yield one unit of output: e.g. Hendrickson, Lave, Matthews,
(2006). The analysis also wields the USBEA’s “Imports” matrix and the “Make” tables.
The particular manner in which each of these databases is utilized is discussed below
and in more detail in section III.
For environmental pollution damage, the analysis uses AP2, an integrated assessment
model (Muller, 2011; 2014a; 2014b; Stephen P. Holland et al., 2015; Paulina Jaramillo and
Muller, 2016) which is an updated version of the APEEP model (Muller, Mendelsohn,
2007; 2009; Muller, Mendelsohn, Nordhaus, 2011; National Academies of Science,
National Research Council, 2010; Jeremy J. Michalek et al., 2011). AP2 estimates
marginal damages ($/ton) for five common and economically important air pollutants.
The marginal damages are estimated by source and pollutant. These are then effectively
treated as prices in that they are multiplied by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
emission data (USEPA, 2002; 2014) to estimate total pollution damage. Armed with such
assessments of pollution damage, a rudimentary measure of pollution intensity is
estimated for every sector in the U.S. economy in 1999 and 2011. This metric reports
monetary pollution damage per unit gross output, by sector, by year. The next step in
the analysis is to couple the pollution intensity metric with USBEA tables. First, the
Hadamard product of the pollution damage matrix and the USBEA “Use” table yields a
total pollution damage matrix. The resulting matrix characterizes a comprehensive

7

assessment of the pollution damage flows among economic sectors. This pollution
damage matrix yields damages from input use and value-added production.
The pollution damages matrix described above enables the sector level analysis of
pollution damage from: exports, private fixed investment, and changes to inventories.
The pollution damage due to consumption (of each sector’s output) by households is
also estimated using the pollution damage matrix. Next, the USBEA’s “Imports” matrix
is used to estimate the avoided pollution damage due to imports; the Hadamard
product of the imports matrix and the pollution intensity matrix generates a measure of
pollution damage, by sector, for imports had they been produced domestically. This matrix
is used to attenuate the estimated pollution damage matrix because imports reduce
domestic pollution. (If imports are not accounted for, pollution from commodity use
and some portion of personal consumption is attributed to domestic output, incorrectly.)
The empirical analysis uses emissions and market production data from the years 1999
and 2011. This twelve year period witnessed some significant changes in both the
macroeconomy and the regulatory environment that make it worthy of study. For
example, the recession following the technology sector correction in 2000-2001 and the
Great Recession of 2008-2009 likely had implications for pollution intensities and gross
pollution output. In terms of public policy, there were a number of interventions that
occurred between 1999 and 2011. Notably, Phase II of the Acid Rain Program (ARP)
commenced in 2000. Important transportation fuel pollution content regulations were
enacted between 2004 and 2010. Further, a series of replacements for the ARP were
8

proposed beginning in 2005. These “threats” of new, more stringent controls for the
power generation sector were credible enough to yield behavioral changes among the
regulated plants. Finally, the beginnings of what could be called climate policy were
enacted toward the end of the time period under study. Importantly, the secular
dimension of the analysis facilitates an assessment of how the various measures or
categories of pollution damages change, by sector, in relative and absolute terms.
a. Preview of Results.
The empirical results begin by reporting how conventional or rudimentary measures of
pollution intensity change, by sector, from 1999 to 2011. To summarize, pollution
intensity fell by a factor of three from 1999 to 2011. There is, however, significant
heterogeneity among sector in this rate of change. Next, the empirics report the rates of
change in both value-added and input use along with the damages from each. Within
the market boundary value-added and input use increased for most sectors. Outside the
market, damages from value-added production and input use decreased. Hence,
pollution intensity declined. Notably, 15 of the 19 sectors tracked show damages falling
more rapidly from input use than from value-added production.
The measures of pollution intensity indicate that the utility sector exhibited the largest
ratio of value-added production relative to input use. This ratio was over 21 in 1999 and
54 in 2011. The sectors with the next largest ratios (waste management) displayed a
value of about seven. The next reported measure of pollution intensity is the ratio of
pollution damage from value-added production for a given sector to that associated
9

with all other sectors’ use of output produced by the particular sector. The largest ratio
is attributed to health care; this measure of pollution intensity was 33 in 1999 and 49 in
2011. (Emissions from this sector come from heating of facilities using fossil fuels.
Consumption by other sectors of health care outputs is relatively emission free.)
The analysis reports that, in 1999, about one-half (56 percent) of pollution damage is
due to intermediate demand and one-quarter of pollution impacts is from household
consumption. Production to meet government demand for inputs and production
targeted to private fixed investment each contributed about six or seven percent of total
pollution damage. Finally, the creation of exported goods and services was responsible
for the remaining 5 percent of external cost.
In 2011, these shares remained relatively stable despite the fact that overall pollution
intensity fell dramatically. Damages from intermediate demand contributed 50 percent
while household consumption comprised 30 percent of total damage. External costs
from production to satisfy government demand and private fixed investment remained
the same (as a share of total damage), while export damages increased to ten percent of
total impacts. In both 1999 and 2011, avoided external costs due to importing goods and
services amounted to roughly seven percent of total damage.
The remainder of this paper is comprised of section I. which develops the theoretical, or
conceptual, structure which links this analysis to the prior literature and aims to
emphasize the novelty of the current work. Section II. explores the empirical model

concludes.
I.

The Input-output system.

An economic system consists of (n) industries consuming (m) commodities. Final
consumption occurs in a household sector (h) over (m) commodities. Define technical
coefficients for commodity (i) and industry (j),�𝑎𝑖,𝑗 � characterizing the monetary value

of commodity (i) consumed, or used, by industry (j) in generating output. The �𝑎𝑖,𝑗 � are

assumed to be defined per unit time corresponding to a typical accounting period, such
as a year. Also note the distinction from a direct requirement table in which the
technical coefficients are normalized by actual use: thus yielding per unit coefficients.
In a static framework, arranging all of the �𝑎𝑖,𝑗 � into matrix form yields a

characterization of the flows of value within the economic system. Such a matrix is
defined as A1:
𝑎1,1
𝐴1 = � ⋮
𝑎𝑚,1

⋯
⋱
⋯

𝑎1,𝑛
⋮ �
𝑎𝑚,𝑛

The empirical application features two distinct data years. As such, A1 may vary across
time, as the flows within the economy change. In order to maintain parsimony in the
following notation, the time dimension is subsumed. Next, additional elements are
added to A1 that make the correspondence with the NIPA I-O tables complete. Namely:
𝐻 = (ℎ1

⋯ ℎ𝑚 )′ reflects household or final consumption of each commodity input;
11

value-added, by industry, is denoted𝑉 = (𝑣1

⋯ 𝑣𝑛 ); the sum of intermediate input

use, is denoted (U = u1,u2,…un); total input, which is the sum of intermediate input and

value added, is (C = c1, c2, …cn). Finally, total intermediate output (O = o1,o2,…om) and
final demand (X = x1, x2, …xn) are included to form (A2). Note that the sum of V and X
(theoretically) balance and equal Gross Domestic Product (GDP).

a. Pollution flows in the system.
There are two primary avenues through which pollution may enter the economic
system: via the use of commodities by industry and households and through final
(value-added) production by each industry. Note the potential for imports and exports.
Pollution from abroad may enter the economic system. Conversely, domestic emissions
may alight upon foreign shores. Neither is able to be modeled empirically 2. As such,
these issues are left to future research. The analysis begins by exploring pollution from
the use of commodities by industry.

In contrast, domestic emissions from production of goods subsequently exported are encompassed. And
avoided damages from imports are also modeled.

i. Pollution from use of commodities, by each industry.
Through the course of producing commodities, pollution, as yet generally defined, is
generated. The pollution technical coefficient for commodity (i), denoted (𝑔𝑖 ),

represents the monetary value of pollution consequences due to the observed

production of one monetary unit of commodity (i). The (𝑔𝑖 ) are assembled into a vector
G over all commodities 3:
𝐺 = (𝑔1

⋯ 𝑔𝑚 )

The product of a technical coefficient �𝑎𝑖,𝑗 � and a pollution technical coefficient (𝑔𝑖 ),

yields an estimate of the gross pollution consequence of use of commodity (i) by

industry (j), per unit time. The product of (G) and (A1), denoted D1 (which is a (1 x n)
vector), shows the total pollution consequence resulting from the use of all commodities
(1) through (m) by each industry (1) through (n).
𝐷1 = 𝐺𝐴1 = (∑𝑚
𝑖=1 𝑎1 𝑔𝑖

⋯

∑𝑚
𝑖=1 𝑎𝑛 𝑔𝑖 )

ii. Pollution from commodity use, across industries.

While the vector D1 contains entries that show damage from total commodity use by
each industry, in this section the analysis is inverted to examine the pollution
consequences from commodity use across industries. This analysis requires a matrix of
pollution technical coefficients. Let 𝑂 = (1 𝑥 𝑛) = (1

⋯ 1).

The procedures used to estimate the empirical coefficients in G are described in the empirical methods
section.

where 𝐹1 = (𝑚 𝑥 𝑛), and (𝐹1 ) consists of (n) replicates of (𝐺). Then, a matrix of

Where 𝐴1 ∙ 𝐹1 denotes the Hadamard Product, or element-by-element multiplication, of

A1 by F1.

The vector D2 assembles the row sums of H1. This shows total pollution consequence, or
impact, due to the use of each commodity across industries (1) through (n).

Contrasting D1 to D2, note that each entry in D1 reports, effectively, pollution damage
from each industry’s consumption of all commodities. D2 reports pollution damage
from the use of each commodity across all industries.
iii. Household final demand.
While D2 captures pollution consequences from total commodity use in production, this
structure omits final consumption by households. Let ℎ1 𝑔1 = total pollution damage
due to household consumption of commodity (1). The vector of total pollution
14

⎠

iv. Value-added and “end-of-pipe” pollution.
Corresponding to final (value-added) production, for each industry (1,…,n), is a
pollution technical coefficient measuring monetary pollution impact, per unit valueadded. These coefficients, assembled in a vector and designated 𝐸 = 𝑒1 ⋯ 𝑒𝑛 , are

intended to capture the pollution intensity of the production activities of each industry,
net of pollution impacts from firms’ use of commodities. Hence, the 𝐸 = 𝑒1 ⋯ 𝑒𝑛

embody “end-of-pipe” pollution, whereas the 𝐺 = (𝑔1

⋯

𝑔𝑚 ) represent “supply

chain” pollution. The Hadamard Product of E and V (the vector of value-added by

industry) gives the gross pollution consequence from final production, by industry.
(Note that this corresponds to the GED reported in: Muller, Mendelsohn, Nordhaus,
2011; Muller, 2013; 2014a; 2014b)
𝐷4 = 𝑉 ∙ 𝐸

Matrix H2 is the environmental pollution analog to A2. Note that H2 is defined in terms
of the pollution damage vectors previously defined (D1, D2, D3,D4) as well as D5 = D1 +
15

D4.Thus, H2 represents the full or complete environmental counterpart to the NIPA I-O
table, A2. Here, GED is the sum of value-added pollution which is equal to the sum of
pollution consequences from final demand.

b. Imports, Exports, Private Fixed Investment, and Inventory.
Although A2 and H2 are comprehensive, the following decomposes final demand into a
more explicit accounting of its component parts. That is, balancing the I-O tables also
requires accounting for imports to the system, exports from the system, capital
accumulation, and changes to private inventory. Each of these flows has pollution
consequences. Tracking these flows in an I-O context for all sectors is an important
contribution of the present analysis.
Imports reduce (domestic) pollution in the sense that if imports are not accounted for,
pollution from commodity use and some portion of personal consumption is attributed
to domestic output, incorrectly. Exports must be added back to the system because, by
definition, they do not appear as commodity use or final consumption in the I-O
accounts. Similarly, private fixed investment is not consumed by industry or

16

households, yet it does reflect production, and the pollution consequence must be
tracked. Finally, changes in private inventory may either reduce pollution flows (since
withdrawals of inventory represent consumption from prior production) or increase
flows if inventories are built up.
These additional aspects of the I-O system are amenable to representation in tabular
form as shown in H3.

c. Characterizing pollution intensity.
In prior research, authors have measured pollution intensity of output as the ratio of
pollution damage to value-added (E, above) or gross output (G, above), (see Muller,
Mendelsohn, Nordhaus, 2011; Muller, 2013; 2014a; 2014b). Thus: 𝐼1 = �
𝐼2 = �

𝐷4�
𝑉 �, and

𝐷4�
𝐶 �, both of which are vector valued. With the machinery developed above,
17

we are equipped to characterize additional measures of pollution intensity. The
measure I3 is defined as the ratio of the damage due to final production by industry (j)
to the damage due to commodity use of the 1 through m commodities by industry (j).
Hence, this is the ratio of “end-of-pipe” pollution to “supply-chain” pollution.

Note that I3 is vector-valued; the vector characterizes the ratio for each industry (1

The next measure of pollution intensity shows the ratio of damage due to final
production by industry (j) to the damage due to consumption of commodities produced
by industry (j), when consumed by all industries (1 through m).

Additional measures of pollution intensity are reported that depict the share of
pollution damage, by sector, by year, due to household consumption, exports, private

Empirical Model and Data.

Section III. consists of two parts. Part III.a. describes the integrated assessment model
used herein. This section describes data sources for the model itself, and how the model

18

is applied to estimate air pollution damage. Section III.b centers on the USBEA data
sources and how these I-O data are employed in the present analysis.
a. Empirical Integrated Assessment Model.
Air pollution damages are estimated using the AP2 integrated assessment model (IAM),
(Muller, 2011; 2012; 2013; 2014a; 2014b; Holland et al., 2015; Jaramillo and Muller, 2016).
AP2 is an updated version of the APEEP model (Muller and Mendelsohn, 2007; 2009;
Muller, Mendelsohn, Nordhaus, 2011; NAS NRC 2010; Michalek et al., 2011). The model
connects emissions to final monetary damage through five modules: emissions, air
quality modeling and concentrations, exposures, physical effects, and monetary damage.
AP2 encompasses five air pollutants: ammonia (NH3), nitrogen oxides (NOx), fine
particulate matter (PM2.5), sulfur dioxide (SO2) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).
AP2 begins with the USEPA National Emission Inventory (NEI) for a particular year; in
the case of the present paper, either 1999 or 2011. These data are reported for specific
sources and for spatially aggregated (by county) area sources for emissions from
entities that do not have an individually-monitored release point. AP2 allocates these
emissions data by location and source type within the model’s matrix-based structure.
For example, all of the roughly 3,100 counties in the lower-48 states are treated as a
source location (the population-weighted centroid of the county, to be specific) for the
county-aggregated emissions reported by USEPA. For the individually reported point
sources, AP2 subdivides these according to the height of the emissions release and
plume rise, referred to as the effective height of emissions. For point sources with an
19

effective height over 500 meters, AP2 models the emissions release by the reported
latitude-longitude of the smokestacks. These 656 sources consist predominantly of
electric generating units, with a few manufacturing facilities as well. For sources with
an effective height between 250 and 500 meters, AP2 treats emissions as if they are
released at the population-weighted county centroid of the county containing the
source (according to USEPA’s NEI). And a similar approach is applied to all remaining
point sources. The key distinction here is that the model recognizes that emissions move
across the landscape differently as a function of their effective height of emission release.
With emission allocated in AP2, the next stage is the air quality model which translates
emissions into ambient concentrations. These are estimated annual, county means. For a
full description of the air quality model in AP2 see (Muller and Mendelsohn, 2007, or
Muller, 2011). The air quality model is based on a source-receptor matrix framework, in
which each cell of the matrix, denoted 𝑇𝑠,𝑖,𝑗 , corresponds to the change in annual

average concentrations of pollutant (s), emitted by source (i), in receptor county (r).
There are distinct matrices in AP2 for the emitted pollutants (listed above). In addition,
the model tracks cross-pollutant elasticities. For example, emissions of SO2 contribute to
ambient concentrations of PM2.5 through atmospheric processes approximated in AP2.
Secondary PM2.5 formation is tracked for emissions of NOx, NH3, and VOC as well.
Further, the model estimates the consequences of NOx and VOC emissions on O3
formation. (For statistical tests regarding the accuracy of AP2 air pollution
concentration estimates, see Jaramillo and Muller, 2016).

20

With air pollution concentration estimates, by county, the model estimates exposures of
sensitive receptor populations by using detailed county-level data covering: human
populations, by age group, agricultural crop yields, timber yields, and man-made
materials that are sensitive to accelerated depreciation due to exposure to acidic
compounds found in common air pollution conditions. In order to translate exposures
into physical effects, the model uses concentration-response functions; these are peerreviewed estimates of the functional relationship between ambient concentrations and
some physical symptom of exposure. In terms of the magnitude of damage, the most
significant relationship is that between exposure to PM2.5 and adult mortality rates. This
study uses the results reported by C. Arden Pope et al., (2002), which is common in the
literature that estimates air pollution damage (USEPA, 1999; Muller and Mendelsohn,
2007; 2009; 2012; H. Spencer Banzhaf and B. Andrew Chupp, 2012). For the O3-mortality
relationship, the findings from Michelle L. Bell et al., (2004) are used. For all complete
list of the concentration-response functions used see: Muller and Mendelsohn, 2007 or
Muller, 2011. Baseline incidence data are provided by the Center for Disease Control
(CDC), (CDC Wonder, 2013).
With physical effects estimated, the last step is to convert the various effects into their
money value equivalents. For adverse consequences that manifest in markets, reported
prices are employed. So, for crop and timber consequences, market prices by crop and
timber type are used. Valuation is considerably more difficult and contentious for
services that are not traded in markets. Of particular importance is the value attributed

21

to mortality risk. This study uses the Value of Statistical Life (VSL) approach to
valuation (W. Kip Viscusi and Joseph E. Aldy, 2003). Briefly, the VSL is an estimate of
the trade-off that society makes between mortality risk and money. VSL’s are estimated
in (typically) one of two contexts: in the labor market via compensating wage
differentials and on surveys in contingent valuation frameworks. The $6 million VSL
used herein is a standard choice for U.S. based studies and regulatory impacts analyses
(USEPA, 1999; 2010). An alternative $2 million VSL is used in the sensitivity analysis.
i. Marginal Damages Algorithm.
AP2 is used to compute marginal damages on a dollar-per-ton basis for every source
and every pollutant in both data years for a total of nearly 100,000 iterations of the
model. The algorithm described in Muller and Mendelsohn (2007; 2009), and
subsequently employed in Muller, Mendelsohn, and Nordhaus (2011) is invoked herein.
This entails, for each data year, take 1999 as an example, estimating baseline damages
due to reported baseline emissions, for all pollutants, damage endpoints, and all
receptor counties, summed up into a scalar value. Then one ton of one pollutant is
added to a particular source. Damages are totaled again in this “add-one-ton” scenario.
The difference between the baseline case and the add-one-ton case comprises the
monetary marginal damage for the chosen source and pollutant in 1999. This process is
then repeated for the next source-pollutant pair and through all of the remaining
possible source and pollutant combinations for 1999 and then 2011. Total pollution

22

damage is computed by multiplying the marginal damage times reported emissions,
matched by year, pollutant, and source.
ii.

Data.

The data employed in this paper are many and varied. Section III.a. has described the
data used in the AP2 model itself. This section focuses on the data used to invoke I-O
techniques. Beginning broadly, the analysis employs the USBEA I-O data for 1999 and
2011. In order to characterize intermediate and final demand, the USBEA I-O Use After
Redefinitions table spanning 1997 through 2012 for 69 industries is employed (USBEA,
2014a). This table reports the money value of commodity use by industry, government,
and personal consumption. The table also reports: exports, private fixed investment, the
and the change in inventory. Each of the “destinations” for current period consumption
(and associated pollution) are used in an effort to “balance” the pollution accounts.
Next, the USBEA Imports Matrix (USBEA, 2014b) is used to deduct, from the Use table,
the money value of imports, by sector and for personal consumption. Importantly,
certain commodities are made by multiple and several industries. Thus, in order to
attribute output (and associated pollution) to the correct producing sector, the paper
relies on the USBEA I-O Make After Redefinitions table spanning 1997 through 2012
(USBEA, 2014c). Specifically, for commodity (i), not made by industry (i), perhaps (j),
the paper deducts the money value of this secondary production from total commodity
use (i) and attributes the value to commodity use for (j). Thus, total value balances with
the USBEA accounts, but is re-allocated to the industry (j) producing the commodity.
23

iii.

NAICS Codes in USBEA and USEPA Data.

Attempts to reallocate production are motivated by the inherent differences in how
market production and pollution emissions are attributed to industrial sectors by
USBEA and USEPA, respectively. In a number of settings, the NAICS codes attributed
to particular sources by these two agencies differ. For example, USBEA attributes the
output from power plants owned and managed by the Tennessee Valley Authority
(TVA) to the federal government (2-digit NAICS = 92), whereas the USEPA affixes such
sources to the utility sector (2-digit NAICS = 22). Since total pollution output and
damage are estimated exogenously to the I-O accounts via the USEPA NEI and the AP2
model, I modify the USBEA accounting for NAICS attribution to the USEPA’s approach
to the extent possible.
Two additional examples of the NAICS discrepancies are sectors 61 (education services)
and 62 (health care services). Both sectors generate non-negligible pollution primarily
through on-site power, steam, and heat production. For publicly-owned universities
(sector 61) and hospitals (sector 62), the USBEA codes output as 2-digit NAICS = 92. In
contrast, the USEPA employs NAICS = 61, and NAICS = 62, respectively.
iv.

Imports, Exports, Private Fixed Investment, and
Inventories.

Imported goods and services are accounted for by deducting consumption of imports
from the Use matrix. Since estimating the pollution content of imports is well beyond

24

the scope of the present analysis, no attempt is made to quantify the pollution damage
(embodied) in imports. (See Arik Levinson, 2009 for a discussion of the pollution
content of imported manufactured goods.)
In contrast, pollution damage due to exports of commodities is explicitly accounted for.
That is, exports enter the Use matrix for each commodity. Estimating pollution damage
from exports amounts to multiplication of the pollution content coefficients (g1,…gm) by
the gross export value for each commodity. This approach is also applied to private
fixed investment and changes in inventories. Note that private fixed investment
(accumulation of capital) corresponds to current period production that is not sold to or
consumed by other industries, households, or exported. Hence, pollution is produced,
and is accounted for by computing the product of the value of fixed investment and the
(g1,…gm) vector. Changes in inventories may correspond to sales of commodities
produced in earlier periods (values less than zero in the Use matrix) and additions to
inventories through current period production. Pollution damage from each case is
estimated by using the (g1,…gm) vector. However, inventory drawdowns are deducted
from current period pollution damage since production of existing inventories occurred
in an earlier period. Thus, the money value of pollution damage from commodities
made in some earlier periods is deducted from total damage from commodity output in
the current period.

25

v.

Remaining Discrepancies.

Remaining discrepancies between the sum of intermediate consumption, final demand,
exports, private fixed investment, changes in inventories, less imports are inevitable for
some sectors. Although both the USEPA NEI and the USBEA I-O data are the best
available estimates of pollution output and flows of commodities, respectively, these
data are not, and cannot be interpreted as, completely accurate census measurements.
The USEPA NEI does consist of measured pollution for point sources with continuous
emission monitoring systems (CEMS), but it is comprised of estimated pollution output
for the balance of sources. Similarly, the USBEA I-O is not based on a comprehensive
census of all firms and establishments, but rather from a sample. This is not intended as
a criticism of either agency; rather, this serves as one explanation for the imperfect
balance between the pollution damage estimates derived by adding that from
intermediate consumption, final demand, exports, private fixed investment, and
changes in inventories (less imports) and the damage estimates directly from the
USEPA NEI.
IV.

Results.

This section of the paper begins with a discussion of summary statistics covering
changes in pollution and market output by sector, as well as the share of GED
contributed by each sector. Next, the analysis focuses on 5 of the top polluting sectors
and the most polluting inputs consumed by each. Various measures of pollution
intensity are then reported. Then the composition of air pollution damage is explored
26

by reporting shares of damage from: private fixed investment, household consumption,
changes to inventory, government consumption and private sector input use. Finally,
the analysis compares damages from exported goods produced domestically and
avoided damages due to imports.
a. Summary statistics and stylized facts.
Table A.2 (in the appendix) presents some stylized facts regarding changes in output
and pollution between 1999 and 2011. The vast majority of sectors (15 out of 19) exhibit
falling GED; only wholesale trade, finance, management, and accommodation and food
services produce greater GED in 2011 than in 1999. Within these sectors, only
accommodation and food services produces a significant share of GED (over 3% in
2011). Conversely, the VA of 16 out of 19 sectors expanded between 1999 and 2011.
Output in construction, utilities, and other services declined. Summarizing the left-hand
panel of table A.1, most industries expanded in terms of market output while
simultaneously reducing their pollution output. Hence, pollution intensity fell.
The right-hand panel of table A.1 shows the share of total GED contributed by each
sector. Generally, the sectors that comprise large shares of economy-wide GED have
had their fractions of total GED remain relatively stable. For example, utility GED
amounted to nearly 32% of total GED in 1999 and just under 31% of GED in 2011.
Manufacturing produced almost 17% of GED in 1999 and slightly more than 15% of
GED in 2011. Similarly, agriculture GED amounted to 18.6% of GED in 1999 and just
over 20% of GED in 2011. These findings speak to the stability of the composition of
27

GED across sectors from 1999 to 2011. However, some sector shares did change
appreciably. For example, the waste management sector produced 9.5% of total GED in
1999 and 5.5% of GED in 2011. Accommodation and food services generated 0.8% of
GED in 1999 but the share from this sector increased to over 3% in 2011. GED from the
transportation sector also increased as a share of total GED by over 2 percentage points.
b. Input-Output Analysis of the Top Five Polluting Sectors.
Table 1 provides a more detailed analysis of the five sectors that generated the greatest
pollution damage in both 1999 and 2011. The table reports damages from input use (this
is denoted D1 in the conceptual model and in table 1) and value-added production
(denoted D4). For each polluting sector, the table reports damages from the top-five
inputs (ranked according to the amount of damage generated by their use) for each of
the five sectors. So, in 1999, value-added damage production (D4) from the
agriculture/forestry sector amounted to about $110 billion. Total damage from the use
of inputs by the agriculture and forestry sector amounted to $29 billion. The input use
that generated the greatest environmental pollution damage was also
agriculture/forestry. (This heavy reliance on intra-sector inputs likely stems from
production of feed to grow livestock.) This sector also relied heavily on output from the
utility sector, and to a markedly smaller extent, on manufacturing, transportation, and
mining and oil and gas extraction products. Hence, intra-sector input use contributed
over 80 percent of damage from inputs. Damages from value-added production were
three-times greater than the damages from input use.
28

The utility sector produced pollution damage from value-added production that totaled
$184 billion in 1999. Damages from input use amounted to just $9 billion. Damages
from value-added production were roughly twenty-times greater than from inputs. The
greatest contributor to input damages for the utility sector was mining and oil and gas
extraction. This sector comprised half of input damage. This should be intuitive given
that air pollution from utilities is mostly due to electric power generation and, in 1999,
most of the power produced in the U.S. was the result of burning coal, natural gas, and
oil. Transportation also was an important component of input damage. Bulky fossil
fuels (coal and oil) are transported by rail, pipeline, and barge from refineries and mines
to power plants for use. (Natural gas is predominantly moved via pipeline.) These
shipments rely of combustion of fossil fuel for power which creates air pollution
damage. Intra-sector consumption of inputs was also a significant source of input
damage for utilities.
The manufacturing sector produced damages from value-added production that were
less than damages from input use: $98 billion from value-added production relative to
$171 billion from input use. This stands in contrast to each of the other sectors in table 1.
Top among contributors to input damage was the agriculture and forestry sector. Inputs
from this sector employed by manufacturers include forest products used in the
production of paper and wood products as well as grains and other agricultural
products used to make food products. Damage from input use from the
agricultural/forestry sector amounted to over one-third of all input damage for

29

manufacturing. Consumption of inputs from the utility sector also contributed a
significant share. This is not surprising given that manufacturers require electric power.
Intra-sector damages were an important source of damage. Nearly 22 percent of input
damage came from the use of inputs produced by the manufacturing sector. The mining
and oil and gas extraction sector along with transportation contributed the next largest
shares of input damages in 1999.
The transportation sector generated air pollution damages of about $55 billion through
value-added production. The waste management sector produced about $57 billion.
Damages from input use in both sectors amounted to a much smaller figure than did
value-added production. For transportation, input damages were about one-fifth the
value of damages from value-added production. For waste management, input
damages totaled just about 15 percent of the damages from value-added production.
For 2011, table 1 indicates that, first and foremost, pollution damages fell both in terms
of input use and value-added production. This supports the findings previously
reported from table A.1. Second, with a few exceptions, the top contributors to input
damages across these sectors remained the same. Notable exceptions to this pattern
include the appearance of damages from the use of inputs produced by the construction
sector by agriculture/forestry and transportation sectors. In addition, the damages from
the use of inputs created by the food services and accommodations sector by the

30

administration and waste management sector 4 also did not show up in the list for 1999.
In addition, only the manufacturing sector exhibited damages from value-added
production less than the damages from input use.
c. Changes in sectoral structure: Inputs, outputs, inside and beyond the
market boundary.
Table 2 reports changes in two measures of industrial structure in terms of market
output and pollution output. The left-hand panel of the table shows annualized changes
in VA and input use, by sector. The right-hand panel displays annualized rates of
change for GED from VA production (D4) and the pollution damage from input use (D1).
Table 2 facilitates an assessment of verticalization at the sectoral level. In terms of the
market accounts, a sector is verticalizing if the value of input use increases slower than
VA. The left-hand side of table 2 shows that the agriculture sector shows evidence of
verticalization as input use increased by just 0.4 percent, per year, while VA expanded
by over 3.2%. Conversely, manufacturing is de-verticalizing since input use increased at
a 2.6% annual rate, while VA grew by 1.7%, per annum. In summary, table 2 shows that
seven sectors are verticalizing and the remaining twelve are de-verticalizing.

This particular result bears some discussion as it highlights a shortcoming of the sector level of analysis.
Within the administration and waste management sector is the travel arrangement service industry.
Within the food- service and accommodation sector are hotels. There is an obvious link between these
two industries. However, most of the air pollution damage from waste management comes from
incineration, waste collection, and landfills. The bulk of air pollution damage from food service and
accommodation comes from restaurants. Because the analysis attributes all industries within a sector the
same pollution technical coefficient, some misappropriation inevitably occurs as is the case for travel
services and hotels.

4

31

The right-hand side of table 2 facilitates an assessment of pollution verticalization. In
order to assess whether sectors are verticalizing with respect to pollution output, GED
from VA production is compared to damage from input use. Evidence of pollution
verticalization manifests if the share of monetary damage from VA production
increases relative to that from input use. Conversely, a sector is de-verticalizing if
monetary pollution damage from inputs increases relative to damage from VA
production. Table 2 shows that, for fifteen sectors, the air pollution impacts from input
use fell more rapidly than (or increased slower than) GED from VA production. This is
evidence of pollution verticalization.
The four sectors exhibiting signs of pollution de-verticalization are: manufacturing,
professional, scientific, and technical services, health care, and other services. Among
these, only manufacturing is a significant contributor of air pollution damage. This
results comports with the aggregate (D1) and (D4) measures reported in table 1. The
annualized rate of reduction in (D4) from $97 billion to $38 billion exceeds that for (D1)
which in absolute terms fell from $171 billion to $79 billion.
Taken together, the market and pollution accounts shown in table 2 suggest that there is
little evidence of a correspondence between market and pollution de-verticalization.
Roughly one-half of all sectors showed evidence of market de-verticalization while just
one-fifth of all sectors exhibit pollution de-verticalization. However, three-fourths of the
sectors that underwent pollution de-verticalization were also de-verticalizing in terms
of market output.
32

Insights with respect to the “causes”, or reasons, for some sectors verticalizing in the
market accounts and de-verticalizing in the pollution accounts come from the I-O tables
in the appendix (see tables A.2 and A.3). Using retail trade as an example of a sector
that exhibited pollution verticalization and market de-verticalization, table A.2 reveals
that, in 1999, 60 percent of input pollution damage was due to consumption of utility
output. This was likely demand for electric power. Table 2 indicates that damages from
VA production in the utility sector fell by over 8 percent annually. The next largest
source of input damage to retail trade was the waste management sector. Damages
from this sector declined by nearly 9 percent per annum. Hence, two major sources of
supply chain damage to retail trade showed a more rapid rate of attenuation than the
damages from VA production. This pattern drives pollution verticalization in the retail
trade sector.
More generally, there appear to be two possible explanations for pollution
verticalization. One reason is that inputs used by particular sectors have become cleaner.
An alternative explanation is that firms substitute among inputs toward less pollution
intensive factors of production. The results for the retail trade sector suggest the former;
the same inputs are being used, their pollution content is falling.
d. Measures of Pollution Intensity.
Table 3 displays four measures of pollution intensity. The first two columns report
conventional measures of pollution intensity: the ratio of GED to VA (I1) and the ratio of
GED to gross output (I2). (These correspond to the pollution technical coefficients E and
33

G discussed in section II., respectively.) Both are expressed in nominal terms.
Beginning with GED/VA (I1), in 1999 both utilities and agriculture produced GED that
exceeded their reported VA. No other sector generated GED that was even close to this
level – relative to VA – in 1999. Specifically, the damages produced by the mining and
waste management sectors amounted to roughly one-quarter of VA. Transportation
GED was less than one-fifth of its VA in 1999.
Many sectors had their GED/VA ratios fall precipitously between 1999 and 2011.
Agriculture GED fell from 120% of VA in 1999 to 40% in 2011. The utility sector GED
dropped from 104% of VA in 1999 to 43% in 2011. The mining and waste management
sector GED/VA ratios fell to less than 0.05. Some of the largest GED-producing sectors
showed less vertiginous reductions in pollution intensity. The manufacturing sector
GED/VA metric declined from 0.065 to 0.03. Construction GED comprised 9.5% of VA
in 1999 and 5.6% of GED in 2011.
The only sector showing higher levels of the (I2) measure of pollution intensity in 2011
than in 1999 was accommodation and food services. For the economy as a whole,
pollution intensity dropped from 7.1% of VA to 2% of VA between 1999 and 2011.
The second column of table 1 shows that the GED/GO (I2) ratios were (i) lower than the
GED/VA ratios which is expected given the relationship between VA and GO, and (ii)
fell from 1999 to 2011, akin to the GED/VA metric. For the total economy, GED
amounted to 3.8% of GO in 1999 and 1.6% of GO in 2011.

34

Although it is obvious that GED/VA will exceed GED/GO, the degree to which these
metrics differ is the first glimpse into the pollution damage generated by the
consumption of inputs relative to final (VA) production. For example, the
transportation sector GED/VA ratio in 1999 was 0.189 and the GED/GO measure was
0.097. This implies that VA was about one-half the magnitude of GO. In contrast, the
manufacturing sector GED/VA ratio was 0.065 in 1999 and the GED/GO metric was
0.024. Thus, VA is roughly one-third of manufacturing GO. Alternatively, the inputs to
manufacturing comprise a larger share of the total value of output than do the inputs to
transportation. The next step in the analysis explores how the value of inputs and
outputs change, by sector, both in terms of the market and pollution values.
Table 3. reports two additional measures of pollution intensity. Recall that (I3) is the
ratio of GED from VA production to pollution damage from input use, by sector. This
measures the relative contributions of VA damages and supply chain damages. The
most striking result with respect to I3 is for the utility sector. In 1999, damage from VA
production by the utility sector was over twenty-times larger than the damages from
use of inputs by the utility sector. This ratio increased to over 54 in 2011. Hence, in both
1999 and 2011, damages due to VA production by the utility sector exceeded damage
due to inputs used by the utility sector to a degree unparalleled by the other sectors in
the economy. This finding makes sense. Most of the damages from utilities accrue from
burning fossil fuels to make power. Thus, minimally processed inputs (raw coal and
natural gas) are burned to make an output which is then consumed by other industries

35

and households. Aside from extraction and transport, inputs to production don’t
produce much in the way of air pollution. In contrast, the production of electricity
yields copious amounts of emissions.
The next largest ratio manifests for the waste management sector; in 1999 VA
production generated over seven times more damage than inputs used by that sector.
The ratios for the transportation and mining sectors were over 4, while that for the
agriculture and construction sectors was over 3. Notably, the manufacturing sector ratio
was just 0.65. Hence, pollution damage from inputs to the manufacturing process
exceeded that from VA production 5.
In summary, twelve sectors in 1999 generated less GED from VA production than
pollution damage stemming from inputs. Six of these sectors generated GED that was
less than or equal to 5% of pollution damage from inputs. Eleven of these sectors also
had a ratio of less than one in 2011; only food service and accommodation increased
above unity in 2011.
The next column in table 3 displays the (I4) ratio which relates GED from VA
production from each sector (i) to the pollution damage from other sectors’ (j not equal
to i) use of commodities produced by (i). If all output was consumed by other industries
as inputs I4 would equal unity. Therefore, if I4 for sector (i) is greater than one, output
for (i) is consumed by entities other than other firms. These may include households,

The I3 results for agriculture, utilities, manufacturing, transportation, and waste management can also
be deduced from table 1.

36

governments, or exports in addition to private fixed investment. Conversely, if I4 for
sector (i) is less than one, the sum of damages due to input use of sector (i) output
exceeds sector (i) GED. This means that inputs are being obtained from sources other
than domestic firms in (i): such as drawdowns to inventories and imports.
In 1999, just three sectors displayed an I4 ratio of less than one: professional, scientific,
and technical services, mining and oil and gas extraction, and construction. (Since only
mining and construction are significant sources of air pollution these two sectors are
explored here.) For mining and oil and gas extraction, imports largely explain this result:
many domestic firms reliant on fossil fuels consumed imported products. Construction,
on the other hand showed a large allocation of its output to private fixed investment
(USBEA, 2014).
Among sectors with an I4 measure greater than unity, four sectors show an I4 ratio of
greater than five in 1999: arts and recreation 6, retail trade, health care, and education.
Emissions from education and health care are typically due to on-site heating and
power generation. Such sectors, and industries within these sectors, produce output
that is not pollution intensive when consumed, or used, by other sectors relative to the
GED they generate in VA production. Most of the other sectors show an I4 ratio
between one and five. For example, the utility sector I4 ratio was 1.7 in 1999 and 1.9 in
2011. Thus, damage from VA production is between one and two-times pollution

Air pollution damages from this sector are mostly due to emissions from marinas (Muller, Mendelsohn,
Nordhaus, 2011).

37

damage emanating from use of commodities by other sectors. Manufacturing had a
similar I4 ratio.
In 2011, all sectors displayed an I4 ratio in excess of one. The most significant differences
manifest in the mining and construction sectors, both of which move from less than one
to greater than one from 1999 to 2011. While the construction sector still devoted a
significant share of output to private fixed investment, total intermediate use doubled
in real terms between 1999 and 2011. In terms of mining and extraction, domestic
production of oil and gas expanded significantly between 1999 and 2011. All else equal
this implies greater intermediate use by domestic firms.
e. Decomposition of Pollution Damage.
Table 4 reports the share of damages occurring due to production in 1999 that: satisfied
private and government intermediate demand, met household demand, went to private
fixed investment, and affected changes in inventory. Economy-wide, the largest share of
damage was from private intermediate demand for inputs. This amounted to 56 percent
of total damage. The next largest component of pollution damage, about 25 percent of
the total, was due to production that satisfied household consumption. Government
intermediate demand and private fixed investment accounted for about 7 percent of
damage each. Changes to inventory contributed a very small share of total damage.
Table 4 also shows the decomposition of pollution damages for each sector. For
example, nearly 80 percent of agricultural pollution damage was due to production that

38

satiated private intermediate demand, while just 15 percent was due to household
consumption. Mining pollution costs showed a different mix: 80 percent of damages
were due to private intermediate demand and 13 percent of damage was from
production targeted to private fixed investment. Like mining, about 80 percent of waste
management damages were due to private intermediate demand. Utility pollution
damage was more equally split between intermediate demand and household
consumption. Manufacturing damage was due to about 50 percent of output allocated
to private intermediate demand, 20 percent for household consumption, and 12 percent
to private fixed investment. The mix of transportation damage was quite similar to
manufacturing. In contrast, sectors such as food services, health care, entertainment,
and retail trade were almost entirely due to personal consumption.
Table 5 is analogous to table 4, focusing on the year 2011. The results, in terms of
damage shares to private and government intermediate demand, personal consumption,
private fixed investment, and inventories are quite similar to 1999. Among the heavypolluting sectors, manufacturing, transportation, waste management, and agriculture
exhibited very similar shares to 1999. Some notable differences include a larger share of
construction damage due to government demand for inputs. This was likely due to
policies exhibiting demand for construction services for the purpose of stimulation.
Utility damages were tilted more toward household consumption in 2011. External
costs from mining production targeted to private fixed investment increased from 13

39

percent of total damage to over 20 percent. This may reflect investment in capital used
for oil and gas extraction.
Table 6 reports the pollution damage intensity of exported goods and the avoided
damages from imported goods. To calculate avoided damages from imports, the value
of imported goods that would have been produced by firms in sector (i), and then used by
firms in sector (j) is multiplied times the domestic pollution technical coefficient for
sector (i). The left panel of table 6 indicates that in 1999, only imports in three sectors
avoided damages that amounted to more than 5 percent of realized damages from
domestic production. The largest of these was in the mining and oil and gas extraction
sector. Had all imports been produced domestically, pollution damage due to
production in this sector would have been 43 percent higher. Manufacturing shows a
similar result. Had all imported goods in the manufacturing sector been made in the
U.S., the pollution damage from this sector would have been 23 percent larger. For the
agriculture sector, damages would have been nearly 10 percent higher had all imported
products been produced domestically. In terms of exports in 1999, goods sold overseas
produced by firms in the manufacturing sector comprised the greatest share of
pollution damage. Damages from the production of exported goods amounted to over
13 percent of total damage from manufacturing. Exports of goods in the wholesale trade
sector (likely refined petroleum products) amounted to over 8 percent of damage from
that sector.

40

In 2011, imports in the same three sectors resulted in the avoidance of damages over
five percent of total (sector damage). The largest again was in mining and oil and gas
extraction. Damages would have been almost 70 percent higher has all imported goods
been produced domestically. Manufacturing damages would have been 30 percent
higher, and agricultural damages would have been nearly 12 percent greater had all
imported goods been made in the U.S. The magnitude of avoided damage due to
imports remained basically constant from 1999 to 2011.
In contrast, the share of damages from goods targeted for export increased from 1999 to
2011 for many sectors. For the economy as a whole, production of exports amounted to
about 5 percent of total damage in 1999 and almost 10 percent in 2011. Particularly large
changes in the share of sectoral damage from exported goods were evident in the
following sectors: mining and oil and gas extraction, agriculture and forestry, and
manufacturing.

Conclusions.

This analysis builds on prior work in the area of environmentally-extended inputoutput analysis (EEIO) by estimating a series of monetary pollution accounts that track
the value flows of pollution damage in the U.S. economy for 1999 and 2011. Several
contributions are novel. First, the paper uses state-of-the-art environmental and
economic modeling to provide the first value-based EEIO of the U.S. economy since the
work of Matthews and Lave (2000) which relied on data now 23 years old. The analysis
goes beyond intermediate demand and value added production to estimate damage
41

coming from personal consumption, exports, government intermediate demand, private
fixed investment, and changes to inventories. The inclusion of two data years reveals a
precipitous reduction in pollution intensity in the U.S. economy. Though earlier work
has provided some evidence of this (Muller, 2014a; 2014b) the present analysis shows
different rates of change in pollution intensity for value-added production and the
consumption of inputs. The inter-temporal framework also reveals stability in sector
level input-output pollution flows.
Perhaps the most fundamental contribution of the work lies in the pursuit of monetary
pollution I-O accounts. The importance of going beyond physical accounts that track
emissions and consumption of natural resources is two-fold. One, this tack encompasses
or reflects the significant heterogeneity in the “prices” attributed to emissions. That is,
prior research indicates that the damage from a unit of local air pollution emissions
varies significantly according to where it is emitted (Fann et al., 2009; Muller and
Mendelsohn, 2009). If an EEIO model only tracks emissions (as much of the published
literature does) all tons are attributed equal weight. This approach diverges from what
is known about the value of such emissions. In addition, the only prior monetary EEIO
model for the U.S employed national average pollution “prices” (Matthews and Lave,
2000). Thus, the same criticism stands. Second, the use of monetary EEIO accounts is
more amenable to a synthesis of market and environmental accounting structures. If the
goal is such a synthesis, then monetary EEIO is clearly preferable to physical accounting
models.

42

Several caveats are worth pointing out. IAMs of the type employed here introduce
considerable uncertainty into the EEIO system. Key sources of uncertainty include: the
modeled connection between emissions and concentrations, the effect of exposure to
fine particles on mortality rates, and the value attributed to mortality risks. The latter
two are not specific to any particular IAM. These sources of uncertainty are inherent in
any attempt to estimate pollution damage. The first source, however, is particular to the
IAM used. In light of this, it is worth noting that the ability of the AP2 model to reliably
connect emissions to ambient concentrations is documented in prior work (Muller, 2011;
Jaramillo and Muller, 2016). Largely left unexplored is a more formal treatment of
uncertainty throughout the different modules of the IAM. Monte Carlo simulations are
left for future work.
The focus on sectoral-level I-O modeling misses intra-sector variation in pollution
intensity of output. As mentioned above, all industries within a sector are attributed the
same pollution technical coefficient. This overlooks considerable variation in pollution
intensity across industries within a sector (Muller, Mendelsohn, and Nordhaus, 2011).
Employing the sector level of analysis also yields some counterintuitive results such as
the large input damages from food and accommodation services due to use by firms in
the waste management and administrative services sector. The sectoral approach is
pursued in this analysis in order to demonstrate the EEIO method in a manner that is
both comprehensive across all sectors and yet of small enough dimension to be
manageable. A direction for further research would decompose the sectoral results,

43

perhaps within the manufacturing sector, to explore a more detailed EEIO set of
accounts.
Building on prior work, this analysis demonstrates that monetary EEIO modeling is
feasible in the U.S. and likely in other developed economies. Although the decision to
create formal, government-sanctioned environmental accounts is fraught with political
and bureaucratic obstacles, the present analysis demonstrates both the feasibility and
value of such an exercise.

Appendix.
Any paper that explores environmental externality in the context of I-O relies, in some
way, on the tools developed by Leontief (1970; 1985), who, in addition to pioneering I-O,
also developed a synthesis between traditional economic I-O and external effects. An
important distinction in the present approach to that of Leontief (1970) and the
subsequent work by many additional authors (Hendrickson et al., 1998) is the following.
Leontief (1970) worked with direct input requirement matrices (denoted A), and used A
to identify the Leontief inverse (I – A)-1 which enabled analyses focusing on changes in
input use (x) corresponding to changes in final demand (y): x = (I – A)-1y . In fact, most
applications of environmental I-O to life cycle analysis (LCA) employ this basic
structure (Hendrickson, Lave, Matthews, 2006).
The present analysis differs in that the USBEA “use” I-O tables are central to the
analysis. Rather than direct requirement matrices, which show the dollar-value
requirements of inputs needed to produce a dollar’s worth of output, the use tables
report actual usage of commodities by industries, in total. In effect, these are
conditioned on observed final demand. This distinction facilitates an ex post assessment
of pollution emissions and damage arising from both use of commodities and industry
value added. The cost of this new approach is the inability to invert the requirements
matrix to solve for inputs, conditional on final demand. However, this is not the thrust
of the present paper as such exercises comprise well-trodden ground in the literature
(Lave et al., 1995; Hendrickson et al., 1998; Hendrickson, Lave, and Matthews, 2006).
55

In order to clarify the distinction between the current work and prior research, this
section explicitly draws out, or explains, the differences and innovations in the present
work relative to the literature. In Hendrickson et al., (1998) a matrix comprised of
pollution impacts, identified on the diagonal, is proposed. This matrix pre-multiplies a
vector of input requirements for some industry (j) to estimate total pollution impact
associated with commodity use by (j) in order to satisfy final demand. In contrast, the
present paper proposes a matrix of pollution impacts from commodity use, for all
industries, conditional of actual usage by industries. Coupled with the use matrix, the
computation of gross, or total, pollution damage from actual output, and commodity
consumption is straightforward: it is the Hadamard product of the use matrix with the
pollution intensity matrix. No inversion is necessary.
Miller and Blair (2006) provide an exhaustive, if now somewhat dated, review of
approaches to EEIO modeling. One of the more relevant passages is that which
emphasizes the distinction among different types of EEIO structures (Miller and Blair,
2006, Section 10.2 p. 446). This passage suggests that the present work is an example of a
commodity-by-industry EEIO model which reports (in this case monetary)
environmental factors as “commodities” produced and consumed by industries or
sectors. Section 10.6 in Miller and Blair (2006, p. 483) also shows that the present paper
is, in a sense, an example of an economic-ecologic EEIO model. This approach creates
an “ecosystem-submatrix”, which in the context of the current analysis, reports
monetary pollution damage (though this could contain emissions) in a separate matrix

56

which is linked to the market I-O tables. Miller and Blair (2006, p. 488) also discuss
linking pollution dispersion models with I-O models which is relevant here. The
approach depicted therein differs from the manner in which the IAM is used in the
present analysis to generate pollution damage estimates by sector and then
subsequently to integrate such damages into an EEIO account.
As the present paper reports relative damages (environmental impacts) from the
production of goods destined for export and avoided (local) damage from imports, the
literature on multi-region I-O models used to characterize the environmental effects of
trade is relevant. The European Commission’s Joint Research Center (EC JRC, 2006)
report provides a summary of EEIO efforts in the European Union. Among other topics,
the report emphasizes the use of EEIO modeling to inform policy design and ex poste
assessments.
The present paper also builds on earlier work in the field of pollution damage
measurement (Mendelsohn, 1980; Muller and Mendelsohn, 2007, 2009; Muller, 2014a;
2014b), and environmental accounting (Nordhaus and Kokklenberg, 1999; Nordhaus,
2006; Abraham, 2006; Muller, Nordhaus, Mendelsohn, 2011).
