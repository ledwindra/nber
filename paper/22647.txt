ABSTRACT
This paper estimates the effect of trade policy during the Great Liberalization of the 1990s on
innovation in over 60 countries using international firm-level patent data. The empirical strategy
exploits ex-ante differences in firms' exposure to countries and industries, allowing us to
construct firm-specific measures of tariffs. This provides a source of variation that enables us to
establish the causal impact of trade policy on innovation. Our results suggest that trade
liberalization has economically significant effects on innovation and, ultimately, on technical
change and growth. According to our estimates, about 7 percent of the increase in knowledge
creation during the 1990s can be explained by trade policy reforms. Furthermore, we find that the
increase in patenting reflects innovation, rather than simply more protection of existing
knowledge. Both improved market access and more import competition contribute to the positive
innovation response to trade liberalization.

Introduction

Trade policy liberalization opens up new markets abroad while increasing the competitive
pressure in the home market. Both mechanisms are likely to affect the innovation rate in
the economy, as well as the rate of economic growth. In this paper we set out to estimate
the net impact of trade policy on innovation, as well as to disentangle the impact of market
access and import competition on innovation.
During the 1990s, tariffs in both developing and developed countries came down substantially, leading researchers to name the period the Great Liberalization of the 1990s (Estevadeordal and Taylor, 2013). Those reductions were predominantly a result of the GATT
Uruguay Round, spanning the years 1986 to 1994 and phased in from 1995 to 2000, but also
a result of regional trade agreements and unilateral liberalization. On average, developed
country tariffs were cut from around 8 to around 3 percent, while developing country tariffs
were cut from 25 to less than 15 percent between 1990 and 2000 (Estevadeordal and Taylor,
2013).
We use the Great Liberalization as a quasi-natural experiment and estimate the causal
impact of diminishing tariffs on innovation by using firm-level variation in country and
industry exposure prior to the tariff cuts. Intuitively, a firm x located in Germany and
selling to the U.S. and Mexico is affected differently than a Japanese firm y selling to China
and South Korea because tariff cuts vary across countries and industries. Furthermore, a
German firm z selling only to Germany is again affected differently because that firm does
not immediately benefit from improved market access abroad but is potentially hurt by
fiercer import competition in its home market.
The data requirements for this exercise are large; one would ideally need a firm-level panel
data set on innovation over a long time period, along with detailed information on where
firms are located and in which markets they sell in. To achieve this, we construct a global and
comprehensive firm-level data set on patenting using PATSTAT from the European Patent
Office.
In our data, we observe nearly every firm worldwide that files a patent, in which country
(patent office) they file, along with their industry and home country affiliation, over four
decades. We do not directly observe in which markets firms sell in, but instead we observe
where firms are patenting. We therefore construct firm-level measures of country exposure
by using patent information up until 1985, one year before the Uruguay negotiations started.
As pointed out by Aghion et al. (2014), patent weights may be a better measure of exposure
because it reflects the firms’ expectations of where their future profits will be. We also

2

provide evidence that the patent weights are highly correlated with sales weights.1
Our firm-level approach has a number of advantages. First, because ex-ante country
exposure varies significantly within a country and within narrowly defined industries, we can
sweep out all home country-industry trends in innovation by fixed effects. Second, because
we observe aggregate patenting in all countries and industries, we can flexibly control for
all other factors that are correlated with tariff cuts and also affect innovation. An example
of this is market size. Being exposed to a high-tariff cut country may be correlated with
innovation simply because this country grows faster (and market size fosters innovation).
Controlling for aggregate patenting in this destination country will eliminate this concern.
Third, our long time period allows us to perform placebo tests; to test if treated firms
(exposed to high-tariff cut countries) typically always patent more.
Our results show that the Great Liberalization of the 1990s had a large positive net impact on innovation. Overall, our estimates can explain roughly 7 percent of the increase in
aggregate patenting over the period. This suggests that innovation was one important channel by which trade policy liberalization improved growth during this period. Furthermore,
our decomposition exercise shows that both improved market access and tougher import
competition have large and positive effects on innovation. The economic magnitude of the
two mechanisms is similar.
One may question whether increased patenting reflects more innovation. The literature
typically finds a strong correlation between patenting and research and development, and
between patenting and other measures of innovation (see e.g. Griliches, 1990). We also
find a strong positive correlation between patent counts and other innovation indicators in
our own data (Appendix Section G). Moreover, our firm-level identification strategy ensures
that all regulatory changes in the patent system, or differences across patent offices, are
differenced out by fixed effects. But the concern remains that more trade could induce
greater protection of intellectual property rights (IPR), i.e. that more patenting is simply
a “lawyer effect”. To deal with this, we calculate citation counts for all firms in our data
set to control for the quality of a patent, and check whether average citations are falling
in response to trade liberalization. This would indeed be the case if import competition
induced firms to take out more patents to protect marginal inventions. The data rejects this
hypothesis, if anything, average citations are rising in response to trade liberalization. We
also use alternative measures to control for quality, like breadth of a patent and size of the
research team behind the patent. The results mirror those obtained using citations.

See Appendix Section E. The weights are also remarkably persistent over time, suggesting that timeinvariant firm and country characteristics are limiting where firms sell and file patents (Appendix Section
F).

The contributions of this paper are as follows. First, we provide broad and systematic
evidence of the impact of trade policy on innovation for a large set of countries over a decade
with steep global tariff declines. This provides external validity compared to the current literature that has primarily focused on relatively narrow policy changes (e.g., Bustos, 2011).
Moreover, there is a large literature on the impact of trade policy on firm performance (e.g.,
TFP or labor productivity), but there is little evidence on observable output or input measures of innovation (e.g., patents and research and development, respectively). Third, we
disentangle the import competition from the market access effect of trade policy, which not
only informs the literature on trade policy but also the broader literature on the effects of
competition on innovation (e.g. Aghion et al., 2005) and market size on innovation (e.g. Acemoglu and Linn, 2004). Fourth, we construct and analyze a novel, comprehensive and global
firm-level patent data set that has so far not been applied in the context of international
trade.
Our analysis thus speaks to different strands of literature. Our work is related to the
empirical analyses of firm level data on the impact of trade on firm performance. Halpern,
Koren, and Szeidl (2015) estimate a model of importers using Hungarian micro data and
find that importing more varieties leads to large measured productivity effects. Recent work
by Gopinath and Neiman (2013) also find large negative measured productivity effects from
a collapse in imports following the Argentine crisis of 2001-2002. The empirical studies of
Amiti and Konings (2007), Goldberg et al. (2010) and Khandelwal and Topalova (2011) all
find that declines in input tariffs are associated with sizable measured productivity gains.
Compared to our work, these papers focus on the impact of trade on firm performance but
do not separately identify what are the channels that allow for the benign impact of trade
on innovation.2 Along the same line of work, but somehow closer to this paper is Boler et al.
(2015) who explores the complementarities between international sourcing of intermediates
and R&D investment and their joint impact on firm performance.
Second, our work relates to the literature on complementarities between exports and
technology adoption. Closest in the spirit to our analysis is empirical work by Bustos (2011)
and Lileeva and Trefler (2010) who show that trade integration can induce exporters to
upgrade technology, Bloom, Draca, and Van Reenen (2016) who focus on the effect of imports
from China on technology upgrading and productivity in OECD countries, and Teshima
(2009) who examines the impact of reduced output tariffs on Mexican firms and finds that
the reduction in Mexican output tariffs increased innovative activity of Mexican firms due
to increased competition. What distinguishes our paper from these contributions is the
2

Note that Goldberg et al. (2010) find that lower input tariffs are associated with increased R&D expenditures.

4

fact that we focus on the global impact of multilateral trade liberalization rather than on
unilateral or bilateral trade liberalization episodes. Moreover, our international firm-level
data set and the high number of countries in our sample provide external validity. Finally,
our paper is also related to Aghion et al. (2014) and Calel and Dechezleprêtre (2014), who
also use PATSTAT data and a related empirical approach, although they focus on very
different questions, being the impact of environmental policies on technical change.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents our theoretical framework. Section 3 describes the data, while Section 4 outlines the estimation details, highlights
econometric issues and provides some descriptive statistics. Section 6 presents and discusses
the empirical results and Section 7 concludes.

Economic Framework

We aim to investigate the effect of trade liberalization on firms’ innovation. To do so, we
start by presenting a basic economic framework to support the analysis, and proceed by
developing predictions for the relationship between trade and innovation.

2.1

Basic Setup

This section presents a basic economic framework that will guide the subsequent empirical
work. We focus on a simple partial equilibrium model that will guide the econometric
specification. Consider the following global profit function of a firm i,
πi =

X

πin = zi

n∈Ωi

X

τnβn ein ,

(1)

n∈Ωi

where zi is productivity, τn is the iceberg-equivalent tariff in country n, βn is an unknown
parameter and ein is a residual capturing all other country-specific factors facing firm i that
determine profits, such as overall demand in country n. The set of countries where the firm
i has positive sales is given by Ωi . We obtain the firm’s global profits by summing across all
countries in Ωi .
In this part of the paper, we abstract from the possibility of bilateral tariffs due to
preferential trade agreements. Our empirical analysis will, however, take this into account
as well. Similarly, to ease notation, we abstract from tariffs being industry-specific so that
we can drop industry subscripts for τn , but we shall exploit industry variation in τn in the
empirical part of the paper.
The profit function captures two main ideas. First, profits increase with effective market

5

P
size ( n∈Ωi τnβn ein ), either due to increased demand ein or by a change in market access 1/τn .
Second, the impact of tariffs on profits may be heterogeneous across countries. In particular,
a decline in home country tariffs may have a net negative impact on profits due to fiercer
competition (i.e., βHome > 0), while a decline in tariffs in export markets is expected to have
a net positive impact due to better market access (i.e., βF oreign < 0). Note the similarity
between our profit function and gross profits in standard trade models with monopolistic
competition. In that framework, ein would capture aggregate spending and the price index
in n, while βn would equal 1 − σ, where σ is the elasticity of substitution. In those models
tariffs enter directly in the expression for gross profits in a market (the market access effect),
but also indirectly through the price index term (the competition effect). For empirical
tractability, we instead choose a specification where ein is invariant to the level of tariffs, but
where βn is allowed to vary across countries.
The set of countries where the firm has positive sales, Ωi , is varying across firms but
taken as exogenous. This is motivated by the empirical fact that there is a high degree
of persistence in country-specific export participation, see e.g. Moxnes (2010).3 Appendix
Section E provides empirical evidence that our empirical country weights are remarkably
persistent over time.
A firm’s productivity zi is proportional the its stock of knowledge Ki , zi = ξKi . We
discuss the measurement of Ki in Sections 4.1 and 6.2. Gaining new knowledge is costly,
and we assume that the cost of obtaining a stock of knowledge Ki is c (Ki ) = ψKik , where ψ
determines average innovation cost and k > 1 determines how quickly those costs rise with
knowledge. The firm then chooses the optimal Ki that maximizes net profits, πi − ci . This
gives the first order condition

n∈Ωi

where κ is a positive constant, κ ≡ (ξ/ψk)1/(k−1) .4
P
The optimal knowledge stock, Ki∗ , is a function of effective market size, n∈Ωi τnβn ein .
This is in line with both theoretical and empirical evidence (see e.g. Acemoglu and Linn,
3

Also, Eaton et al. (2011) find that over half the variation across firms in market entry can be attributed
to heterogeneity in firm efficiency, and efficiency is highly persistent over time.

The second order condition for profit maximization, ∂ 2 πi /∂Ki2 −ψk (k − 1) Kik−2 = −ψk (k − 1) Kik−2 <

2004 and Bustos (2011)). Trade liberalization affects innovation through improved market
access and through increased competition, and the magnitudes (and signs) of these effects
are determined by the parameters βn . Improved market access raises profits in a destination
and will therefore give more innovation, suggesting a negative βn . A more competitive
marketplace may foster innovation due to an increased threat to monopoly rents, which may
induce incumbent firms to innovate more in order to “escape” competition (see e.g. Aghion
et al., 1997 and Aghion et al., 2005), also suggesting a negative βn . On the other hand,
the fundamental Schumpeterian force implies that competition lowers price-cost margins,
thereby reducing the rents from innovation and the incentives to innovate (see e.g. Aghion
and Howitt, 1992), suggesting a positive βn .
Now consider a change in τn and ein from period t = 0 to t = 1. Using Jones’ hat algebra
popularized recently by Dekle et al. (2008), we get
!1/(k−1)
K̂i =

X

ωin τ̂nβn êin

,

(4)

n∈Ωi

where ωin ≡ πin0 /πi0 and the hat notation denotes the change from t = 0 to t = 1, x̂ ≡ x1 /x0 .
The weights ωin are simply the share of global profits generated in each country n in the
pre-period (t = 0). In Appendix Section D we show that equation (4) can be approximated
by
X
∆ ln Ki =
βn∗ ωin ∆Tn + εi ,
(5)
n∈Ωi

P
where Tn ≡ τn −1 is the ad-valorem tariff, βn∗ ≡ βn / (k − 1) and εi ≡ n∈Ωi ωin ∆ ln ein / (k − 1).
We proceed with this approximation because it is empirically more convenient to work with.

2.2

Predictions for Trade liberalization and Innovation: Two Cases

The setup in Section 2.1 gave us a simple relationship between the growth in a firm’s knowledge stock and changes in ad-valorem tariffs. This section develops the final estimating
∗
equations. We consider two cases; first a symmetric model, S, with βn∗ = βm
≡ β ∗ , so that
the impact of lower tariffs in home and export markets is identical. Second, we employ an
asymmetric model, A, where the impact of lower tariffs is allowed to differ across home and
export markets, β ∗H 6= β ∗E , where β ∗H is the home market impact and β ∗E is the export
market impact. In the first case, we can rewrite equation (5) to
∆ ln Ki = ηi + β ∗ ∆T̄i + εi ,

7

(6)

where
T̄it ≡

X

ωin Tnt

(7)

n∈Ωi

is the weighted average of tariffs across all of firm i’s markets including its home market, and
where we introduce the variable ηi to account for all other factors that may also affect the
growth of a firm’s knowledge stock (i.e., a growth fixed effect that may be correlated with
∆T̄i and εi ).5 According to our framework, we expect that the knowledge stock is growing
when weighted average tariffs decline ( β < 0) or when weighted average demand (εi ) rises.
The unobserved demand shifter εi is the regression residual.
In model A the change in knowledge stock is given by

∆ ln Ki = ηi + β ∗H ωiH ∆TiH + β ∗E 1 − ωiH ∆T̄iE + εi ,

(8)

where ωiH denotes the home market weight, TiH is the home market tariff while the weighted

 P
average tariff in foreign markets is given by T̄iE ≡ 1/ 1 − ωiH
n∈Ωi \h ωin Tn . This specification model allows us to separate the import competition effect from the market access
effect of trade policy. Specifically, β ∗H will be identified by firms with a high degree of
home bias, while β ∗E is identified by firms primarily exposed to foreign markets, and as such
mostly affected by the weighted average tariff T̄iE in foreign markets. While both theory
and empirical evidence suggest that better market access gives rise to more innovation, i.e.
that β ∗E is negative, as discussed above the sign of β ∗H is theoretically ambiguous due to
the undetermined net effect of increased competition on innovation.

Data

3.1

Patents

Overview. We use patents from PATSTAT to measure a firm’s innovation and knowledge
stock.6 PATSTAT offers bibliographic data, family links and citations of 90 million applications of nearly 100 countries. It contains the population of all patents globally since the mid
1960s. The patent documents as provided by PATSTAT are a rich source of information. We
observe the name of the applicant and date of filing and publication. We know the geography
5

As described in the Section 3 below, tariffs will be measured at the 3-digit industry-level, so that T̄i will
vary both because firms are exposed to different markets and because firms belong to different industries.

of the patent in the sense that we have information on both source and destination country.
Source country is the residence country of the applicant. Destination is the country of the
patent authority (e.g. USPTO, EPO, JPO, etc). Appendix Section A provides more details
the construction of our data set.
Firm characteristics. PATSTAT allows us to construct an international firm-level dataset
and to follow the patenting activity of a firm through time. The number of patents filed pit
for firm i in year t is our basic measure of the innovative activity of a firm. In our analysis,
a patent corresponds to a unique invention, i.e. filing the same patent in multiple locations
does not inflate the patent count pit . Specifically, PATSTAT organizes patents into “patent
families” that identify identical inventions filed in multiple countries.7 We date patents by
application filing year.8 An additional advantage of PATSTAT is that names of applicants
are harmonized over the entire sample period, alleviating the concern that slight differences
in the spelling of firm names generate multiple firm IDs.9 Unfortunately, information about
firms in PATSTAT is restricted to what can be retrieved from the patent applications. Our
basic firm characteristics are industry affiliation (NACE 3-digit), home country of the firm,
as well as in which countries the firm is patenting.

3.2

Tariffs

The main source of tariff data is the UNCTAD Trade Analysis and Information System
(TRAINS), which contains tariffs at the most disaggregated level of the Harmonized System
(HS) for more than 150 countries. From this database we extract the average applied MFN
industry-level tariff (NACE 3-digit) Tnjt for industry j, country n, for year t over the period
1992 to 2009. Appendix Section B describes the procedure followed to calculate industrylevel tariffs, while Appendix Section C provides details about the historical background for
tariff reductions during the 1990s.
In addition to UNCTAD TRAINS data, we use information on regional trade agreements
(RTAs) between pairs of countries. This allows us to take into account the fact that some
countries are part of trade agreements, and as such cannot be treated as having the same
level of protection as countries where such agreements are not in force. The information on
RTAs for around 200 countries from 1948 to 2006 comes from the CEPII gravity dataset.10
7

We use DOCDB patent family.
This is a common approach in the empirical literature because the application filing date is more closely
timed with the R&D process than the patent publication and grant date. Patent applications are usually
published 18 month after the first application.
9
An applicant can be a firm or individual, but we will use the terminology firm when referring to an
applicant.

Estimation Details

We use the Great Liberalization as a quasi-natural experiment and estimate the causal
impact of tariffs on innovation by using firm-level variation in which countries firms were
exposed to before the tariff cuts. This section provides details about the measurement of
variables as well as the construction of the final sample and discusses econometric concerns.

4.1

Measurement and Baseline Periods

Weights. According to the theoretical predictions outlined above, the impact of trade liberalization will depend on the reduction in weighted average tariffs. Hence, both the symmetric
and asymmetric model presented in Section 2.2 require data on the country weights ωin .
According to our models, these weights should reflect the relative importance of a country
n in the firm’s total profits. Profits and sales are unobserved in our data, but we do observe
in which markets a firm is patenting. As pointed out by Aghion et al. (2014) a patent based
weighting scheme may potentially be a better measure because it reflects the firms’ expectations of where their future market will be. We follow Aghion et al. (2014) and calculate the
share of patents issued in country n relative to all the patents issued by the firm during the
pre-period (to be defined below). Specifically, we define
xin
,
ωin ≡ P
k xik

(9)

where xin is the number of patents issued by firm i in market n during the pre-period.
Seeking intellectual property rights in a country is typically motivated by (future) profits
in that market. There is strong empirical support that patent weights are highly correlated
with sales weights (Aghion et al., 2014). We provide additional empirical evidence on this
in Appendix Section E. The weights are also remarkably persistent over time, even over a
period of 20 years, see Appendix Section F. This suggest that geographic frictions due to
e.g. country-specific entry costs on the supply side or idiosyncratic taste differences on the
demand side, are severely limiting where firms sell and file patents.
Pre-period. We calculate the weights based on patent data over the years 1965 to 1985.
We use 1965 as the starting year because the number of patents in PATSTAT is limited in
earlier years. 1985 is chosen as the final year because the Uruguay round negotiations started
in 1986; hence the weights are not themselves affected by trade liberalization of the 1990s.
Sample period. The years 1992 to 2000 are defined as our baseline sample period. Hence,
the change in average tariffs facing firm i is ∆T̄i = T̄i2000 − T̄i1992 and the change in the
knowledge stock of firm i is ∆ ln Ki = ln Ki2000 − ln Ki1992 . The choice of sample period is
10

motivated by the fact that tariff reductions agreed upon during the Uruguay Round were
gradually phased in from 1995 until 2000. Starting our sample in 1992 ensures that we
capture the full impact of tariff reductions. Our data also confirms that the 1990s was
unique: the overall reduction in tariffs was much greater during latter half of the 1990s
compared to both earlier and later periods. Finally, we choose to work with long differences
1992-2000 in our baseline specification because we want to allow for long time lags in the
innovation response to trade liberalization. Long differences also eliminate serial correlation
in the errors, since the averaging over periods ignores time-series information (Bertrand et al.,
2004).
Tariffs. As described in the Section 3, tariffs will be measured at the 3-digit industrylevel, so that T̄i , T̄iE and T̄iH will vary both because firms are exposed to different markets
and because firms belong to different industries.
Outcome variable. In the model presented above, the outcome variable ∆ ln Ki is the
change in the log knowledge stock. Our empirical counterpart is the cumulative patent
count of a firm until year t,
t
X
Kit ≡
pis ,
(10)
s=1965

where pis is the number of patents filed by firm i in year s. The outcome variable ∆ ln Kit =
ln Ki2000 − ln Ki1992 gives the change in cumulative patent count between 1992 and 2000 and
provides a measure of the innovation that takes place during this time period. Focusing on
the change in the stock over a long time period smooths out lumpiness and zeros in the pit
variable. Indeed, in a given year the median pit is zero while the maximum pit is very large,
suggesting that linear models are not adequate to model the data generating process at the
annual level.
Alternative measures of innovation We have chosen to use patents to measure firm level
innovation.11 Patenting is known to be highly correlated with innovation and R&D, see e.g.
Griliches (1990). In the Appendix Section G we document a close relationship between R&D
expenditure and patenting in a subsample of our data set.

4.2

Final Sample of Firms

Our point of departure is the data set constructed on the basis of PATSTAT described in
Section 3.1 and in the Appendix Section A. Our final sample consists of the following firms.
First, firms must be observed in the pre-period (1965-1985) in order to be assigned weights
11

See Griliches (1990) and more recently Nagaoka et al. (2010) for a review of the use of patent data as
an innovation indicator.

11

ωin . Second, in our baseline specification firms must issue at least one patent in 2004 or later.
This is done to ensure that firms actually exist during the 1990s. For example, if pit = 0
from 1995 and onwards, the econometrician cannot tell whether this is due to firm exit
or firm survival but no patenting. Hence, our final sample is a strongly balanced dataset,
with no firm entry or exit. In Section 6.3 we perform robustness tests allowing for firm
exit. Third, in some cases firms have missing address and home country, or they may issue
patents in countries with missing tariff data for their industry.12 These firms are dropped
from the analysis. In sum, these restrictions reduce the sample to roughly 72,000 firms from
60 countries, filing 1.5 million patents over the 1992-2000 period. As a comparison, the raw
PATSTAT data contains about 12.2 million patents over the 1992-2000 period.

4.3

Econometric Issues

Estimating the symmetric model S and the asymmetric model A is challenging for a number
of reasons. The first econometric concern is that the weighted average tariff reduction ∆T̄i
may be correlated with unobservable firm characteristics ηi . For example, firms exposed to
high-tariff reduction countries may innovate more even in the absence of trade liberalization.
We solve this by including home country-industry pair fixed effects in the regressions as well
as controlling for pre-period firm characteristics.13 Intuitively, we compare firms within the
same industry, headquartered in the same country, and with similar observed characteristics
during the pre-period, but that differ in terms of their exposure to international markets,
and ask whether firms exposed to high tariff-cut countries innovate more than firms exposed
to low tariff-cut countries.
An alternative way of solving this problem is by differencing out idiosyncratic firm trends.
Specifically, we split the sample into our main period, 1992-2000 (t = 1) and add a second
period, 2000-2004 (t = 2), when the decline in tariffs was much smaller (see Figure 1 below),
and estimate model S by

∆ ln Ki2 − ∆ ln Ki1 = β ∆T̄i2 − ∆T̄i1 + εi .

(11)

Idiosyncratic growth trends in innovation, ηi , that may be correlated with ∆T̄i , is then differenced out. We use a similar specification for the asymmetric model A. This is reminiscent of
a triple differences model, as we compare the growth in the change in tariffs (two differences)
12

We drop all firms that have non-zero weights for one or more countries with missing tariff data, i.e. if
Tjnt is missing when calculating T̄it from equation (7).

Industries are defined at the NACE 3 digit level. Pre-sample covariates are home weights ωiH , the
number of countries the firm is patenting in during the pre-period, ni,P re , and the log knowledge stock of
the firm in 1985, ln Ki,P re .

across firms (third difference).
P
A second econometric concern is that the error term εi ≡ n∈Ωi ωin ∆ ln ein , which is a
weighted average of all other country-specific factors that determine innovation, may be correlated with trade liberalization. A case in point is the TRIPS agreement that strengthened
IPR among WTO members in the aftermath of the Uruguay round. A positive correlation
between tariff reductions and IPR strengthening could therefore produce biased estimates.
We solve this by using the fact that we observe aggregate patenting by industry and country,
and this measure is itself determined by the unobserved shocks ei . Specifically, we calculate
P
the aggregate knowledge stock by industry j and headquarters country h, Khjt = i∈Γhj Kit ,
where Γhj is the set of firms in industry j headquartered in h, and construct the weighted
average

where ∆ ln Knj = ln Knj2000 − ln Knj1992 . While headquarters-industry pair fixed effects
control for innovation trends in firm i’s home market, ε̃i controls for innovation trends in
firm i’s destination markets. For example, if a US headquartered firm primarily exposed to
the Indian market is innovating more because the Indian market is growing quickly (high
∆ ln eIndia ), then including ε̃i will control for this effect.14

Descriptives on Patents and Tariffs

Weighted average trade barriers. To illustrate our identification strategy, we take a closer
look at the weighted average trade barriers, T̄it for our final sample of firms. Figure 1 shows
the mean T̄it for firms headquartered in the U.S., Germany, Japan and the UK. There is a
strong decline during the 1990s; the average firm experienced a decline in weighted tariffs
of around 3 percentage points during the 1990s. Also, the decline almost stops in the year
2000, consistent with the fact that Uruguay Round concessions were phased in until that
year. The averages mask a considerable amount of heterogeneity: Figure 2 shows that the
whole distribution of weighted tariffs (T̄it ) across firms shifts markedly to the left from 1992
to 2000.

Section 6.3 describes an alternative empirical strategy using fixed effects for each of firm i’s destination
markets.

Patents and citations. Figure 3 shows average patenting pit as well as average citations

increasing during the 1990s, while average citations are fairly constant over the period. Of

course, these aggregate trends may not only reflect innovation, but could also reflect changes
in firms’ behavior, legal trends and changes in the patent systems worldwide.

Results
Innovation and Trade Liberalization

We proceed by estimating the symmetric (S) and asymmetric (A) models presented in equations (6) and (8). As described in Section 4.3, all specifications include home countryindustry (NACE 3-digit) pair fixed effects, which will control for aggregate (country and
industry) trends in patenting. Columns (1) to (4) in Table 1 show results for model S with
various control variables included. Column (1) has only fixed effects, column (2) adds presample firm characteristics (the home weight ωiH and the number of countries the firm is
patenting in during the pre-period ni,P re , as well as log knowledge stock in 1985, ln Ki,P re ),
while column (3) also controls for aggregate destination trends ε̃i , as explained in Section 4.
The results are highly significant and fairly constant across specifications, with an estimated
coefficient in the range of -0.8 to -1.0. The final specification where we control for idiosyncratic firm trends (equation 11) in column (4) also produces a negative and significant result,
although the economic magnitude is slightly smaller.
A semi-log elasticity of -0.9 implies that a one percentage point reduction in tariffs causes
a 0.9 percent increase in the knowledge stock. Our data shows that over the period 1992 to
2000 the mean knowledge stock among firms globally grew by 45 percent (mean of ∆ ln Ki ),
while the mean reduction in the firm specific tariff measure T̄it was almost three percentage
points (mean of ∆T̄i ). Hence, our results suggest that roughly 7 (3/45) percent of the
observed increase in the knowledge stock can be explained by trade policy reform.

We also show the results graphically using a binned scatter plot in Figure 5. The figure
plots changes in firm-specific tariffs ∆T̄i versus changes in the log stock of knowledge, ∆ ln Ki ,
over the 1992-2000 period. The bins are created by dividing the sample into 20 equal-sized
groups and taking the averages of ∆T̄i and ∆ ln Ki within each group. Both variables are
first demeaned by home country-industry averages, which is equivalent to controlling for
home country-industry fixed effects. It is interesting to note that the binned scatter plot,
which is a non-parametric representation of the conditional expectation function, is close to
linear.
The symmetric model S masks the fact that trade liberalization in the home market can
have a different effect than liberalization in export markets. Table 2 shows the results when
we estimate the asymmetric model A and disentagle the effect of tariffs TiH and export market
tariffs TiE . Columns (1) to (2) show the baseline model with and without the destination
market control ε̃i , while column (3) controls for idiosyncratic firm trends. The coefficient
for ωiH × ∆TiH captures the differential impact of home tariffs depending on the firm’s home
bias. The coefficients are negative and significant, indicating that firms with high exposure
to the home market innovate more, relative to firms with less exposure to the home market,
when home tariffs decline. Hence, our results suggest that unilateral liberalization raises

innovation in the home market. The coefficient for 1 − ωiH × ∆T̄iE captures the differential
impact of export market tariffs depending on the firm’s export market bias. Again, we find
a negative and significant number, suggesting that firms highly exposed to export markets
innovate relatively more when export market tariffs decline. As above, the point estimates
17

become slightly smaller when controlling for idiosyncratic firm trends in column (3).
According to our model in equation (8), the estimated coefficients for ∆T̄iH and ∆T̄iE (not
interacted with ωiH and 1 − ωiH ) should be zero. This simply means that home tariffs should
not matter for firms not selling to the home market, and that foreign market tariffs should
not matter for firms not exporting. Interestingly, we find that the coefficient for ∆T̄iE is not
significantly different than zero, consistent with the prediction of the model. The coefficient
for ∆T̄iH is not identified, because it is subsumed by the home country fixed effect.
Theory suggests that the market size effect of trade policy liberalization promotes innovation, while the import competition effect may encourage or discourage innovation, depending
on the strength of escape-competition and Schumpeterian forces. Our results suggest that
both the market size and import competition effect increase innovation, so that the net effect
is unambiguously positive.

means of the y- and x-axis variables are scattered within each bin. The solid line

6.2

Is Patenting a Good Measure of Innovation?

One may argue that patents are an imprecise measure of knowledge and innovation. According to Nagaoka et al. (2010) roughly half of the patents owned by a firm are used either by
18

them internally or licensed to others. The remaining patents are used for strategic reasons,
e.g. attempts to block inventions by competitors. Hence, it is possible that firms take out
more patents, without innovating more, in response to e.g. import competition. If this were
the case, one would expect that firms are taking out patents on their marginal innovations,
so that the average quality of their patent stock is decreasing.
To address this issue, we use three different proxies for patent quality: the number of
citations, size of the research teams behind a patent, and the number of technology areas
(IPC codes) to which a patent is attributed (patent breadth). We use citations because
high value inventions are more extensively cited than low value patents (Harhoff et al.,
1999). We include the size of research teams since a set of studies have associated the
number of inventors listed in a patent with the economical and technological value of the
patent (OECD, 2009). Finally we include number of technical classes attributed to a patent
application (patent breadth) which e.g. Lerner (1994) has found to be a measure of the value
of a patent portfolio.
We calculate average quality of the knowledge stock as follows. Let qp denote the number
of citations three years after a patent p was filed, or the number of inventors or the number
of IPC codes associated with patent p. The cumulative sum is then
Qit =

t
X
X

qp ,

(13)

s=1965 p∈Ξis

where Ξis is the set of firm i’s patents filed in year s. The average quality of the knowledge
stock is then calculated as Q̄it = Qit /Kit . We proceed by using ∆ ln Q̄i = ln Q̄i2000 − ln Q̄i1992
as the dependent variable and estimate the symmetric model S in (6) again.
The results using all three proxies for quality are reported in Table 3. The results suggest
that trade liberalization did not affect the quality of patents, i.e. there is no evidence of a
“lawyer effect”. If anything, the point estimates indicate that trade policy may have increased
the quality of patents.

6.3

Robustness

Falsification test. A potential concern is that firms being exposed to countries with high tariff
cuts always have higher patent growth compared to other firms. To address this concern, we
perform a placebo test and regress knowledge growth during the 1980s, ln Ki1988 − ln Ki1980 ,
on trade policy changes during the 1990s, ∆T̄i2000 − ∆T̄i1992 .15 The results are shown in the
15

The weighted average T̄it is now calculated using weights ωin based on a firm’s patent portfolio until
1980 (not 1985 as in the baseline). This is done in order to ensure that the weights ωin are not themselves

first column of Table 4: the coefficient of interest becomes noisy and close to zero, suggesting
that there are no differential pre-trends in patenting.
Country-level tariff data. Next, we take some additional steps to refine our analysis. First,
industry-level tariff data may not always be the relevant tariff facing the firm, because it
may also be exporting or importing products associated with other 3-digit NACE industries.
We therefore test the sensitivity of our results using the simple average country tariff instead
of industry specific tariffs. The results, shown in the second column of Table 4, confirm our
main finding that a reduction of a firm’s tariffs increases innovative activity. The estimated
effect is similar in magnitude to our main specification and economically significant.
Regional trade agreements. Our main measure of tariffs is the applied MFN ad-valorem
rate. This masks the fact that many firms get preferential market access through regional
trade agreements (RTAs). Recognizing this, we calculate a firm-level measure of how exposed
a firm is to RTA’s. Specifically, we construct RT¯Ait in a similar way as the average tariff
rate, T̄it , above as a weighted average of RTAs across all of firm i’s markets:
RT¯Ait ≡

X

ωin RT Ahn ,

(14)

n∈Ωi

where RT Ahn = 1 if the home country h and country n have an RTA and zero otherwise.16
We then add ∆RT¯ Ai = RT¯ Ai2000 − RT¯ Ai1992 to the model. The results in column (3) show
that the RTA variable is insignificant while our main variable ∆T̄i continues to be highly
significant and negative.
determined by the dependent variable ln Ki1988 − ln Ki1980 .
16
As a matter of convention, for the firm’s home country we set RT Ahh = 1.

20

Triadic patents. Third, we restrict our sample to triadic patents. These are patents filed
at the three main patent offices, namely the European Patent Office (EPO), the Japanese
Patent Office (JPO) and the United States Patents and Trademark Office (USPTO).17 Triadic patents are commonly used in the literature to retain only highly valuable inventions
and to work with a more uniform and comparable set patents. This is shown in the last
column of Table 4. In this case, the sample size is significantly reduced and the standard
errors become very large. The point estimate, however, is close to our baseline results.
Firm exit. Our sample is limited to firms that file at least one patent at the end of the
observation period (between 2004 and 2014). Thus, by construction, all our firms survive
until the end of the sample period. However, firms may exit the market or be acquired by
other firms as a result of increased competition following trade liberalization. To address
this concern, we estimate the model including all firms that have at least one patent during
the 1965-1992 period. The estimated effect in column (5) on this larger sample of firms is
still highly significant but the magnitude is somewhat lower. This may suggest that trade
policy also induced firm exit as well as M&As, although one would need data on actual exit
and M&As to corroborate this.
Destination country trends. The variable ε̃i was included in the regressions to capture
patenting trends in destination countries. An alternative empirical strategy is to include destination country fixed effects in the regressions. Specifically, we rewrite model S in equation
(6) to
X
∆ ln Ki = ηi + β∆T̄i +
γn + ε i ,
(15)
n∈Ωi

where γn is a fixed effect for destination n, and we sum over all countries where the firm
has non-zero weights during the pre-period (the set Ωi ). As an example, if all firms exposed
to the Indian market (but not necessarily headquartered in India) have high ∆ ln Ki , then
this will be controlled for by γIndia . Identification of β then only comes from within-country,
across-industry variation in tariffs, i.e. that among firms exposed to the Indian market,
some firms experience greater tariff reductions because they belong to an industry getting
large tariff cuts in India. Destination country trends will therefore control for the possibility
that firms exposed to India may patent more because of unobserved factors specific to India
(e.g., growth in market size or strengthening of IPR). The estimated coefficient in column
(6) shows that β is still highly significant, although the economic magnitude is lower than
in the baseline specification.

families are constructed.

Conclusions

We set out to analyze the impact of the global decline in tariffs during the 1990s on firms’
innovation.It is an issue that so far has not been the subject of rigorous analysis despite
its relevance. Our results show that the Great Liberalization of the 1990s had a large
positive net impact on innovation. Overall, our estimates can explain roughly 7 percent
of innovation globally during this time period. Our findings underscore the importance of
trade liberalization for firms’ long term performance and for aggregate economic growth.
Our study points to large dynamic gains from trade; gains that are typically not observed
and therefore neglected in empirical analyses.
Our estimates are robust to a set of econometric issues, and in particular we provide
evidence in support of patents being a useful measure of innovation. While there is a large
literature on the impact of trade policy on firm performance, we are able to separately
identify what are the channels that allow for the benign impact of trade on innovation.
Specifically, we disentangle the import competition from the market access effect of trade
policy, which implies that our results do not only add to the literature on trade policy but
also the broader literature on the effects of competition on innovation.

Appendix
A

PATSTAT

We use patents from PATSTAT to measure a firm’s knowledge stock. To construct our data
set we need to deal with a set of issues:
Identify unique firms/patent holders. As described in the main text, for each patent application in PATSTAT we know the exact name of the patent applicant(s). However patentee
names that appear in patent documents may vary both within and across patent systems.
Inconsistencies might be due to spelling mistakes, typographical errors, name variants, etc.
In order to identify unique patent holders, we use the ECOOM-EUROSTAT-EPO PATSTAT Person Augmented Table (EEE-PPAT). This table was developed by EUROSTAT
in collaboration with ECOOM (K.U.Leuven) and Sogeti, and provides harmonized patent
applicants’ names obtained through an automated algorithm.18 These harmonized names
have been included in PATSTAT TLS906_PERSON table since October 2011. We use the
variable “HRM_L2_ID” from this table.
Patent families. To construct the knowledge stock variable we use patent counts. In
principle, an applicant may decide to patent an invention in one or more countries, depending
on where he seeks IP protection, and he can do so contemporaneously or at subsequent times
after the first application. Therefore, simply counting the number of patent filings for each
patentee would result in double counting the number of unique inventions belonging to each
firm. To avoid this problem, we look at patent families. A patent family identifies and
groups all subsequent patent filings originating from the same initial (priority) application;
hence it comprises all patents protecting the same invention.19 An example can be helpful
to clarify the main idea behind patent families. Suppose a German firm develops a new
invention and patents it in Germany. Subsequently, it decides to seek protection for the
same invention in US and in Japan and files a patent at the USPTO and at the JPO. These
three applications clearly protect the same invention and thus belong to the same patent
family. For the purpose of our analysis these three applications are counted as one. Notice
also that a patent family is a generic term: different definitions of how to group applications
can be applied, depending on the specific purpose. Throughout our analysis we use DOCBD
patent families.20

The OECD Patent Statistics Manual defines patent families as “the set of patents (or applications) filed
in several countries which are related to each other by one or several common priority filings”(OECD, 2009,
Ch.4, p.71).

Assigning patents to firms. We identify the list of patent applicants from PATSTAT table
TLS207_PERS_APPLN. Applicants have “APPLN_SEQ_NR” greater than 0. The same
table provides the correspondence between each applicant and the patents he owns. We use
this built in link to assign patents to firms. Technically, patentees can be private business
enterprises, universities/higher education institutions, governmental agencies, or individuals,
but for simplicity we call them firms throughout the paper. At this point, one clarification
is required. It is possible that several applicants co-own the same patent. In this case we
proceed by assigning the patent to every co-owner of the patent application.
Identify home country of firms. In order to identify the home country of a firm we use
PERSON_CTRY_CODE from TLS906_PERSON in PATSTAT. One difficulty is that the
information on the applicant’s country is not always reported. Firms without information
on home country are dropped in what we refer to as the final sample. Notice that a firm may
be associated with more than one country. We have 42574 of such cases. When this is the
case, we let home country be the one with the highest frequency in the data. We consider
each applicant’s home country as its headquarter country.
Identify the industry affiliation of a firm. PATSTAT assigns one or more industries j
(NACE revision 2) to each patent application p. Industries are given weights wpj that sum
to one for a given application (table TLS229). We let the industry affiliation of a firm be
defined by the main industry of a firm being the industry that obtains the maximum weight
P
across all of the firm’s applications, max p wpj during the pre-period.

Tariff Data

The main source of tariff data is the UNCTAD Trade Analysis and Information System
(TRAINS), which contains tariffs at the most disaggregated level of the Harmonized System
(HS) for more than 150 countries. From this database we extract the average ad-valorem
industry-level tariff (NACE 3-digit) Tnjt for industry j, country n, for year t over the period
1992 to 2009.
Details on construction First, we convert 6-digit HS codes to a the 6-digit HS Combined
(HSC) nomenclature using a World Bank correspondence table.21 In some cases, a 6-digit
tariff line is missing in year t, but non-missing in t − 1 and t + 1; in these cases we interpolate
to get a non-missing observation in year t. We also extrapolate tariffs in those cases where
tariffs exist in 1995 but not in 1992-1994, or 1994 but not 1992-1993, or 1993 but not 1992.
Tariff data for all EU member countries are also manually added to the database, as EU
and how they are constructed.

are calculated as the simple average across countries. 3-digit NACE tariffs are
aggregated to country level tariffs using simple averages.

tariffs are not listed for individual EU countries in the raw data. Second, we balance the raw
data and drop all HSC-country combinations that are not available for all years 1992-2009.
This is done to eliminate the possibility that average tariffs change simply due to sampling
issues. Third, we aggregate the data to NACE revision 2 3-digit codes. To do so, we first
aggregate to 4-digit ISIC revision 3.0 by using a correspondence table from the World Bank.
This is then converted to 4-digit ISIC revision 3.1, then to 4-digit ISIC revision 4, which is
again converted to NACE revision 2. The last three conversions use correspondences from
the UN.22 In cases where several ISIC revision 3.1 codes are associated with a single NACE
revision 2 code, we take the simple average across the ISIC codes. In some cases, a firm has
a missing industry code or a 2-digit code instead of a 3-digit code. In those cases, we use the
simple average tariff across all industries, or across 3-digit codes within a 2-digit industry,
P
Tnt = (1/N ) j Tnjt , instead.
The final tariff data set contains data for 96 countries, 128 3-digit industries and 12,174
country-industry combinations. Figure 6 shows average tariffs for high- and low income
countries in our final tariff data set.

Trade Policy During the 1990s

Launched in Punta del Este, Uruguay, on 20 September 1986, the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations was formally concluded in Marrakesh, Morocco, on April 15 1994,
when 125 Governments and the European Communities, accounting for more than 90 percent
of world trade, concluded a historical agreement to reform international trade. As stated in
the Marrakesh declaration,23 the Uruguay Round achieved a global reduction by 40 percent
of tariffs and wider market-opening agreements on goods. In addition, participation in the
Uruguay Round was considerably wider than in any previous multilateral trade negotiation
and, in particular, developing countries played a notably active role in it. While only few
developing countries took part in earlier GATT rounds, and trade barriers reduction was
negligible,24 the Uruguay round achieved important tariff reductions in both developed and
developing countries. The Uruguay Round implied commitments to cut and bind tariffs on
the imports of goods. The tariff reductions agreed on were explicit on both the timing and
magnitude in cut. The deadlines for cut ended in 2000.
The major results of the Uruguay Round were the individual commitments of the contracting parties to cut and bind their custom duty rates on imports of goods. It is important
to note that the phase-in of tariff reductions were agreed on during the negotiations. This
feature of the Marrakesh Agreement implies that tariff reductions were pre-determined and
therefore unlikely to be correlated with contemporaneous shocks, or to be driven by political
pressure arising from the effects of trade liberalization.
For non-agricultural products the agreed tariff reductions were implemented in five equal
installments.25 The first cut was made on the date of entry into force of the WTO agreement,
and the following four on 1 January of each subsequent year.26 Over the five years, this
process led to a 40% tariff cut on average on industrial products in developed countries,
from an average of 6.3% to and average of 3.8%.
In addition to tariff cuts, the number of “bound” tariffs27 increased significantly, from
78% to 99% in developed countries, from 21% to 73% in developing countries, and from 73%
to 98% in transition economies.

Bound tariffs are duty rates that are committed under WTO. Raising them above the bound rate is
possible but hard: the process involves a negotiation with the most affected countries and it possibly requires
a compensation for their loss of trade.

Patent and Sales Weights

This section provides empirical evidence that trade and patent flows are highly correlated.
Patents and Imports We aggregate the patent data to the country-pair level, where the
source country is the location of the applicant firm and the destination country is the location
of the patent office. level and consider the source country of patent flows. We calculate the
share of patents filed in country s that come from firms headquartered in country r, relative
to all other foreign patents filed in country s,
χrst = P

Patents from r to s at time t
k6=s Patents from k to s at time t

Similarly, by using trade data from CEPII, we calculate the import share ψrst as the share

Figure 7 shows the import and patent inflow shares on the horizontal and vertical axis,
respectively, on log scales, for four major economies, the U.S., Germany, Japan and Great
Britain in year 2000. There is a high degree of overlap; typically the top three countries
on the import side are also the top three countries on the patent side. In Figure 8 we plot
all country pairs in our sample for the year 2000. We see that there is a strong log linear
relationship between bilateral patenting and trade, with a linear regression slope of 0.80 (s.e.
0.02). Finally, we show that the patent flows adhere to a gravity model. Table 5 shows
results when regressing the number of patents from r filed in s on distance and GDP in r
and s (all in logs). Column (1) uses only the year 2000 cross-section sample, while column
(2) uses all years from 1965 to 2006 and includes year and country-pair fixed effects. Just
as for trade flows, bilateral patenting falls with distance and increases with the size of the
home and destination country.

Patents and Exports We use survey data for European firms from EU-EFIGE/BruegelUniCredit data set (henceforth EFIGE) to calculate firm specific export shares to differ33

ent country groups, and compares them to patent weights from PATSTAT.28 The EFIGE
database consists of a representative sample of about 15,000 manufacturing firms (above 10
employees) across seven countries (Germany, France, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom, Austria, Hungary). andprovides information on firms’ international activities. We use firms’
self-reported export shares for 2008 and for each firm we construct weights for market exposure based on the share of sales to eight groups of countries:29 EU 15 countries, other EU
countries, other European countries not EU, China and India, other Asian countries, USA
and Canada, Central and South America, and a residual category including all remaining
countries.30
We match the EFIGE data with firm level data from Amadeus which in turn can be
matched with PATSTAT using the patent application number of each patent owned.31 We
calculate weights for market exposure based on firms’ patenting activity abroad that correspond to those we have calculated for exports using patent applications for the period of
1998 to 2008. 32 Figure 9 shows a kernel-weighted local polynomial regression of patent
shares on export shares for firms with at least one patent. Again we observe that there is a
strong relationship between patent and trade weights. The corresponding linear regression
slope is 0.89 (s.e. 0.008).

28

The EFIGE data set is described in Altomonte and Aquilante (2012).
Specifically, we use the answers to two questions. D4 asks: “Which percentage of your 2008 annual
turnover did the export activities represent?” D13 asks: “If we assume that the total export activities equal
to 100 which percentage goes to each of the following areas: 15 UE countries area, Other UE countries, Other
European countries not UE (Switzerland, Norway, Russia, Turkey, Byelorussia, Ukraine, . . . ), China and
India, Other Asian countries (excluded China and India), USA and Canada, Central and South America,
and Other areas.
30
The weight for EU 15 is computed by summing a firm’s exports share to EU 15 area and the share of
sales in its home market.
31
Specifically, from the variable patent application number in Amadeus we are able to construct the appln_nr_epodoc in PATSTAT, and to link each patent application in Amadeus to the same patent application
in PATSTAT.
32
When the application authority is EPO, we assume that the patent was filed in at least one of the EU
15 countries, and include it in the EU 15 share. The motivation is that EPO filing is cost effective if the
applicant wants to protect an invention in 4 or more countries, so there must be at least one application filed
in one of the EU15 countries. If a firm does not have patents, then all its weights for all groups of countries
are set to zero.

(s.e. 0.008).

Persistence in Patent Weights

This section provides empirical evidence that patent weights ωin are highly persistent over
time. We calculate weights ωint based on all patents filed during three non-overlapping time
periods, t = 0: 1965-1985, t = 1: 1985-1995 and t = 2: 1996-2005. First, we calculate
the likelihood of continuing to patent in a country conditional on patenting there in t = 0
(i.e., the extensive margin). We also calculate the likelihood of patenting in t = 0 and
t = 1 conditional on patenting in the same country in t = 2. We use our final sample
of firms, which ensures that we know that all firms exist throughout the sample. Table
6 reports the results. Even after 20 years, the likelihood of continuing to patent is high
(44 percent). The same is true on the entry side; conditional on patenting in a market in
t = 2, the likelihood of patenting in that market 20 years earlier is nearly 40 percent. These
conditional probabilities are an order of magnitude higher than the unconditional probability
of patenting in a market. The final row in the table shows that the unconditional probability
is roughly 4 percent. Second, we calculate the correlation in weights conditional on patenting
in that market in both t and t + 1 (i.e., the intensive margin). Figure 10 shows the expected
weight in t = 1 and t = 2 conditional on a 1985 weight ωin0 . Even after 20 years there is a
highly significant and positive correlation between the weights.

Patents as a Measure of Innovation

There are different measures of innovations. We use patents count which is a measure based
on the output of innovation activity. An alternative measure is R&D expenditure which
is based on input rather than output. Here we examine the robustness of patenting as an
36

indicator of innovative activity by looking at the correlation between patent applications
and R&D expenditures. We rely on the EFIGE survey data referred to above and match
these with Amadeus and PATSTAT. This leaves us with a sample of European manufacturing firms.EFIGE contains information of firms’ average investment in R&D activities as
percentage of turnover for the period 2007-2009.33 Using turnover data from Amadeus we
are able to calculate average R&D expenditures for the same period.
We proceed by calculating the correlation between firm level R&D expenditures (in logs)
and the number of patent applications (in logs) for each firm.In order to account for the
lag between the investment in R&D and the successful outcome of the R&D process and
subsequent patent application, we calculate the average number of patents applied for per
year by a firm by considering a window of six years. We include the survey period (20072009) and the three subsequent years, until 2012. On the intensive margin, higher R&D
expenditures are strongly correlated with a higher number of patent applications. Figure 11
shows a kernel-weighted local polynomial regression of firms’ R&D expenditures on number
of patent applications. The relationship between the number of patents filed by a firm and
its investment in R&D is strong and positive. This relationship is not monotonic. We notice
a drop for firms with very high numbers of patent applications; but only a minor number
of firms file such a high number of patent applications per year. The corresponding linear
regression slope is 0.68 (s.e. 0.05).
On the extensive margin, we find that firms with at least one patent application spend on
average more on R&D than firms with no patents. We use firm level R&D expenditures and
construct a binary variable, which equals one if the firm has applied for one or more patent on
average in the period 2007-2012 period, and zero otherwise. Figure 12 shows the histogram
of average R&D expenditures for firms with positive patent applications and for firms that
didn’t file any patent. The shape of the distribution is very similar in the two groups, but for
firms with patents the distribution is shifted to the right, suggesting a positive correlation
between R&D expenditures and patenting. For high levels of R&D investments, there is a
higher share of firms with at least one patent application. Conversely, for low levels of R&D,
the share of firms with no patent applications is higher. We also run a correlation between
firm level R&D expenditures and the binary variable indicating whether, on average, the
number of patent applications per year in the 2007-2012 period is positive. We repeat the
same exercise for both the level and the log of R&D expenditures. The results are reported
in column one and two of Table 7 respectively. In both cases we find a positive and strong
correlation between R&D expenditures and patent applications.
33

Calculation is based on the question C21 in EFIGE that asks: “Which percentage of the total turnover
has the firm invested in R&D on average in the last three years (2007-2009)?”
