    "abstract": "\n\nWe develop a dynamic multi-country trade model with foreign direct investment (FDI) in the form of non-rival technology capital. The model nests  structural gravity sub-systems for FDI  and trade, with accumulation/decumulation of phyisical and technology capital in transition to the steady state.  The empirical importance of the FDI channel is demonstrated comparing actual aggregate cross-section data for 89 countries in 2011 to a hypothetical world without FDI. The gains from FDI amount to 9\\% of world's welfare and to 11% of world's trade, unevenly distributed among winners and losers. Net exports of FDI substitute for export trade in the results.\n\n",
