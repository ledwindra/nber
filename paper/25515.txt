ABSTRACT
We study a model where firms accumulate data as a valuable intangible asset. Data accumulation
affects firms’ dynamics. It increases the skewness of the firm size distribution as large firms
generate more data and invest more in active experimentation. On the other hand, small datasavvy firms can overtake more traditional incumbents, provided they can finance their initial
money- losing growth. Our model can be used to estimate the market and social value of data.

Big Data and Firm Dynamics
By Maryam Farboodi, Roxana Mihet, Thomas Philippon, and Laura Veldkamp∗

We build on ideas of others who studied information in the macroeconomy. The
growth and learning-by-doing literatures
model data as technology-augmenting.1
Modeling data as information about the
firm’s optimal choice, allows us to incorporate countervailing forces like the diminishing returns to data.2 In Veldkamp (2005)
and Fajgelbaum, Schaal and TaschereauDumouchel (2017) information is a byproduct of economic activity and a signal,
but the focus is on asymmetric cyclical fluctuations. Our framework differs because of
its growth in data and its incorporation of
heterogeneous firms. Both are essential to
study changing firm dynamics.

How does data affect firm dynamics?
As markets become more concentrated and
dominated by data-savvy firms, it is important to understand the macroeconomic role
of data. While Brynjolfsson and McElheran
(2016) have already found a connection between information technology and market
concentration, a macro framework allows
economists to value firms’ data, perform
counter-factuals, and understand why data
has the effects it does. Therefore, we build
a framework for measurement and policy
analysis.
We argue that data has four important
features: (i) data is a by-product of economic activity; (ii) firms use data to increase their efficiency; (iii) data is information, which is distinct from technology; and
(iv) accumulated data is a valuable asset.
Our objective is to write the simplest framework that includes these features.
We build a model where heterogeneous
price-taking firms invest, produce, and accumulate data. Data causes long-lived
firms to grow bigger for two reasons. First,
data helps firms become more productive.
Productive firms invest more, grow larger,
and produce more data. This is a “data
feedback loop.” Second, firms invest more
than they otherwise would because additional production generates more data.
This is “active experimentation.” We also
learn that initial size is not the most important factor in the success of a firm. A
small firm that uses data efficiently, meaning that it harvests more data per unit of
production, may lose money initially while
it builds up its data stock. But if the firm
can finance this phase, it can quickly outcompete a larger, less data-efficient firm.

I.

Setup

We consider a competitive industry.
Time is discrete and infinite. There is a
continuum of firms indexed by i. Firm i
α
uses ki,t units of capital to produce ki,t
units
of goods of quality Ai,t . Let Pt denote the
equilibrium price of quality-adjusted goods.
The inverse demand function and the industry quality-adjusted supply are:
(1)
(2)

Pt = P̄ Yt−γ ,
Z
α
Yt = Ai,t ki,t
di.
i

Firms take the industry price Pt as given
and their quality-adjusted outputs are perfect substitutes.
Quality depends on a firm’s choice of a
production technique ai,t . In each period,
and for each firm, there is one optimal technique with a persistent and a transitory
components: θi,t + a,i,t . The persistent
component θi,t is unknown and follows an
AR(1) process: θi,t = θ̄ + ρ(θi,t−1 − θ̄) + ηi,t

where ηi,t is i.i.d. across time and firms.
The transitory shock a,i,t is i.i.d. across
time and firms and is unlearnable. Deviating from that optimum incurs a quadratic
loss in quality:
h
i
(3) Ai,t = Āi Â − (ai,t − θi,t − a,i,t )2 .
Data helps firms infer θi,t The role of a is to
prevent firms from inferring θi,t at the end
of each period. It makes the accumulation
of past data a valuable asset. If a firm knew
the current value of θi,t , it would maximize
quality by setting ai,t = θi,t .
A key idea of our model is that data is
a by-product of economic activity. Therefore, we assume that the number of data
points observed by firm i at time t depends
α
on their t − 1 production ki,t−1
:
α
ni,t = zi ki,t−1
,

(4)

where zi is the parameter that governs how
“data-savvy” a firm is. A data-savvy firm
is one that harvests lots of data per unit of
output.
Each data point m ∈ [1 : ni,t ] reveals
(5)

si,t,m = θi,t + i,t,m ,

where i,t,m is i.i.d. across firms, time, and
signals. For tractability, we assume that all
the shocks in the model are normally distributed: fundamental uncertainty is ηi,t ∼
N (µ, σθ2 ), signal noise is i,t,m ∼ N (0, σ2 ),
and the unlearnable quality shock is a,i,t ∼
N (0, σa2 ).

Firms update beliefs about θi,t using
Bayes’ law.
Each period, firms observe last period’s revenues and data, and
then choose capital level k and production technique a. The information set
of firm i when it chooses ai,t is Ii,t =
ni,τ t
[{Ai,τ }t−1
τ =0 ; {{si,τ,m }m=1 }τ =0 ].

Solution

The state variables of the recursive problem are the prior mean and variance of beliefs about θi,t−1 , last period’s revenues, and
the new data points. Taking a first order condition with respect to the technique
choice, we find that the optimal technique is
a∗i,t = Ei [θi,t |Ii,t ]. Let the posterior variance
of beliefs be Σi,t := Ei [(Ei [θi,t |Ii,t ] − θi,t )2 ].
Thus, expected quality is Ei [Ai,t ] = Ā −
Σi,t − σa2 . We can thus express expected
firm value recursively.
LEMMA 1: The optimal sequence of capital investment choices {ki,t } solves the following recursive problem:

See online Appendix for the proof. This
result greatly simplifies the problem by collapsing it to a deterministic problem with
only one state variable, Σi,t . The reason we
can do this is that quality Ai,t depends on
the conditional variance of θi,t and because
the information structure is similar to that
of a Kalman filter, where the sequence of
conditional variances is generally deterministic.3 This Kalman system has a 2-by-1 observation equation, with ni,t signals about
θi,t and one signal about θi,t−1 . The signal
about θi,t−1 comes from observing last period’s output, which reveals quality Ai,t−1 ,
3 For any k , the optimal choice of technique is ali,t
ways the same: a∗i,t = Ei [θi,t |Ii,t ]. The way ai,t enters
into expected quality Ai,t is through E[(E[θi,t |Ii,t ] −
θi,t )2 ], which is the conditional variance Σi,t . We can
replace the entire sequence of a∗i,t with the sequence of
variances, which is deterministic here because of normality. The only randomness in this model comes from the
signals and their realizations, but they never affect the
conditional variance, since normal means and variances
are independent. Thus, given Σi,t−1 , Σi,t is a sufficient
statistic for ni,t and Σi,t+1 . The mean E[θi,t |Ii,t ] is not
a state variable because it only matters for determining
ai,t and does not affect anything else.

are changing the size distribution of firms.
We start by calibrating firm sizes in a model
with no data processing, to match the size
distribution of U.S. firms. Then, we turn
on data processing to observe how sizes
change. For most parameters, we choose
round numbers that deliver sensible outcomes.
What governs the steady-state size of a
firm is its product quality parameter Āi .
We choose twelve levels of Āi as follows:
We match the steady-state ki,t of a firm,
with that Āi and with no data production
(zi = 0), to the average size of the firm
in each of twelve firm-size categories, as
defined by the 2016 Longitudinal Business
Database. Each of these sizes has a market
share associated with it, which is the number of firms in that size category, divided
by the total number of firms in 2016. In
Figure 1, the dashed line labeled “no data
production” plots size and market share, as
reported by our data.
To compute the change in size of firms
when all firms process data, we change one
parameter and re-compute the steady state.
Instead of z = 0, we set z = 1 for all firms,
so that production generates usable data.
Figure 1 shows that the new firm size distribution (solid line, labeled “with data production”) has more large firms. The very
largest firms get substantially larger.
While one expects larger firms with more

Solid line is old incumbents with zold . Dashed line is new, data-savvy entrants with znew > zold . Parameters are as

data to benefit most, there is a counteracting force. Bayes’ law tells us that each
unit of data increases the precision of a
forecast by less and less. Diminishing returns to data works against increasing returns to scale. Our results suggest that
scale wins. Of course, to make precise quantitative statements, future work should calibrate the model more carefully. But the
exercise illustrates how one might use the
framework for measurement and makes the
point that the effect of data on firm size
may be sizable.
Entry of New Tech Firms

We learned that data processing makes
firms larger. But what are the dynamics of
the transition to the new big-data steady
state? To learn about how the economy
might behave in the transition, we consider
two types of firms. Type old firms are oldeconomy incumbents that either do not generate much data or do not make good use of
the data they get. These firms have a low
zold , meaning that they get few data points,
per unit of output. Type new firms are
data-savvy and have higher value of znew .
They start small, with low capital, but they
scrape lots of data from the transactions
that they generate.
We consider an industry in steady state
with a mass one of identical, old-economy
firms. We then drop a mass M of new,
data-savvy firms that have not accumulated
any data yet. We solve for the dynamic

transition path to the new steady state,
with both types of firms in the economy.5
When new firms enter, they have no data
to guide their choice of technique. They
do not know what consumers want, thus
they experiment. They supply goods and
services of random quality and do not generate much contemporaneous value, on average. Figure 2 (dashed lines) shows the
initial low capital investment and negative
profits of the entrants. But these new firms
learn quickly over time. As they accumulate data, their productivity improves.
They scale up and generate even more data.
As soon as new firms enter, the market
value of old firms drops. Old firms anticipate the rise of the new firms and expect their capital to generate less profit
in the future. They cut investment and
produce less. The output quality of new
firms is initially low, so the industry-wide,
quality-adjusted output initially falls (Figure 2, right panel) and the industry price
initially rises. Output then expands as new
firms learn, improve their quality and invest
more.
5 There is a continuum of old and new firms so we
can apply the law of large numbers to each group. The
industry equilibrium (output and price) is deterministic, although individual firms’ output and productivity
are random. We solve for eight unknowns, Pt , Yt , Aold,t ,
Anew,t , Σold,t , Σnew,t , kold,t , and knew,t . The old firms
start with the stock of capital (and data) they had in
the old industry steady state. The new firms start with
knew,0 close to zero, thus they have little data. Each
type of firm has its own Bellman equation and anticipates correctly the future path of the price level.

5

How quickly the entrants overtake the incumbents depends on their data accumulation advantage znew − zold , as well as on
the persistence of the optimal technique ρ.
If the state is persistent, old data remains
useful and it takes more time for the entrant to overtake the incumbents. In fastchanging environments, new data is more
valuable and the transition is quicker.
II.

Future Research

Data is changing how firms operate and
compete. We offered a simple framework
that can help us to think about these
changes systematically. One could use this
framework for many purposes. One would
be to estimate the value of data. If we
rewrite the value function as a function
of precision, V (Σ−1 ), rather than variance,
then V 0 (Σ−1 ) is the marginal value of additional data precision. Since Bayes’ law
tells us that precision is linear in signals,
this is equivalent to measuring the marginal
value of data, where the quantity of data
has some natural economic interpretation
as additional units of forecast precision.
Another feature that would be natural to
add is to relax the perfect competition assumption and explore strategic firm behavior. Surely, there would be some interaction
between market structure and the effects of
data. Similarly, data can be bought and
sold. One could add to (6) a term representing revenues from selling or a cost of
buying additional data. That term would
be a price of data, times a net quantity of
data transferred. Small firms’ ability to buy
data could change the competitive benefits
of size.
Policy questions about data regulation
abound. Without equilibrium reasoning,
it is difficult to say much about potential
consequences. A model like this can help
us think through the non-obvious consequences of market-wide regulatory changes.
Theory models of big data are essential because theory guides thinking in environments where the future may look quite different from the past.

Model Solution Details

There are two sources of uncertainty in firm i’s problem at date t: the (random) optimal
technique θi,t , and the aggregate price Pt . Let (µ̂i,t , Σi,t ) denote the conditional mean and
variance of firm i belief about θi,t given its information set at date t, Ii,t .
In this section, we will first describe the firm belief updating process about its optimal
technique. Next, we argue that in this environment, the firm’s optimal production choice
is deterministic, and thus the price is deterministic as well. Finally, we lay out the full set
of equations that characterize the equilibrium of this economy with two groups of firms.
Belief updating. The information problem of firm i about its optimal technique θi,t can
be expressed as a Kalman filtering system, with a 2-by-1 observation equation, (µ̂i,t , Σi,t ).
We start by describing the Kalman system, and show that the sequence of conditional
variances is deterministic. Note that all the variables are firm specific, but since the
information problem is solved firm-by-firm, for brevity we suppress the dependence on
firm index i.
At time t, each firm observes two types of signals. First, date t − 1 output provides a
noisy signal about θt−1 :
(1)

yt−1 = θt−1 + a,t−1 ,

where a,t ∼ N (0, σa2 ). We provide model detail on this step below. Second, the firm
observes nt = zktα data points as a bi-product of its economic activity. The set of signals
{st,m }m∈[1:ni,t ] are equivalent to an aggregate (average) signal s̄t such that:
(2)

s̄t = θt + s,t ,

where s,t ∼ N (0, σ2 /nt ). The state equation is
θt − θ̄ = ρ(θt−1 − θ̄) + ηt ,
where ηt ∼ N (0, σθ2 ).
At time, t, the firm takes as given:


µ
bt−1 = E θt | st−1 , y t−2


Σt−1 = V ar θt | st−1 , y t−2
where st−1 = {st−1 , st−2 , . . . } and y t−2 = {yt−2 , yi,t−3 , . . . } denote the histories of the
observed variables, and st = {st,m }m∈[1:ni,t ] .
We update the state variable sequentially, using the two signals. First, combine the
priors with yt−1 :

E θt−1 | It−1 , yt−1 = t−1 −1

where Mt = σa−2 (Σt−1 + σa−2 )−1 .
Equations (4) and (5) constitute the Kalman filter describing the firm dynamic information problem. Importantly, note that Σt is deterministic.
Modeling quadratic-normal signals from output. When yt−1 is observed, agents know
their capital kt−1 . Therefore, they can back out At−1 exactly. To keep the model simple
for a short paper, we assumed that when agents see At−1 , they also learn whether the
quadratic term (at−1 − θt−1 − a,t−1 )2 had a positive or negative root. An interpretation is
that they can figure out if their action at was too high or too low.
Relaxing this assumption complicates the model because, when agents do not know
which root of the square was realized, the signal is no longer normal. One might solve a
model with binomial distribution over two normal variables, perhaps with other simplifying
assumptions. For numerical work, a good approximate solution would be to simulate the
binomial-normal and then allows firms to observe a normal signal with the same mean and
same variance as the true binomial-normal signal. This would capture the right amount of
information flow, and keep the tractability of updating with normal variables.
Deterministic Dynamic Production Choice

Consider the firm sequential problem:
max E0

∞
X

β t (Pt At ktα − rkt )

t=0

We can take a first order condition with respect to at and get that at any date t and for
any level of kt , the optimal choice of technique is
a∗t = E[θt |It ].
Given the choice of at ’s, using the law of iterated expectations, we have:
E[(at − θt − a,t )2 |Is ] = E[V ar[θt |It ]|Is ],
for any date s ≤ t. We will show that this object is not stochastic and therefore is the
same for any information set that does not contain the realization of θt .
Lemma. The sequence problem of the firm can be solved as a non-stochastic recursive
problem with one state variable.
Proof of Lemma 1. We can restate the sequence problem recursively. Let us define the

8

value function as:


Vt ({st,m }m∈[1:nt ] , yt−1 , µ̂t−1 , Σt−1 ) = max E At ktα − rkt + βVt+1 ({st+1,m }m∈[1:nt+1 ] , yt , µ̂t , Σt )|It−1
kt ,at

α
with nt = kt−1
. Taking a first order condition with respect to the technique choice conditional on It reveals that the optimal technique is a∗t = E[θt |It ]. We can substitute the
optimal choice of at into At and rewrite the value function as
h

Vt ({st,m }m∈[1:nt ] , yt−1 , µ̂t−1 , Σt−1 ) = max E Ā − (E[θt |It ] − θt − a,t )2 ktα − rkt
kt
i
+ βVt+1 ({st+1,m }m∈[1:nt+1 ] , yt , µ̂t , Σt )|It−1 .

Note that a,t is orthogonal to all other signals and shocks and has a zero mean. Thus,
h

Vt ({st,m }m∈[1:nt ] , yt−1 , µ̂t−1 , Σt−1 ) = max E Ā − ((E[θt |It ] − θt )2 + σa2 ) ktα − rkt

+ βVt+1 ({st+1,m }m∈[1:nt+1 ] , yt , µ̂t , Σt )|It−1 .
Notice that E[(E[θt |It ] − θt )2 |It−1 ] is the time-t conditional (posterior) variance of θt , and
the posterior variance of beliefs is E[(E[θt |It ] − θt )2 ] := Σt . Thus, expected productivity is
E[At ] = Ā − Σt − σa2 , which determines the within period expected payoff. Additionally,
using the Kalman system equation (4), this posterior variance is

which depends only on Σt−1 , nt , and other known parameters. It does not depend on
the realization of the data. Thus, {st,m }m∈[1:nt ] , yt−1 , µ̂t do not appear on the right side of
the value function equation; they are only relevant for determining the optimal action at .
Therefore, we can rewrite the value function as:

Equilibrium with Two Types of Firms

Here we re-introduce the dependence on firm index i. Assume there are two types of
firms, i = L, H, were L (H) stands for low (high)-tech firm. High tech firms have high
data efficiency: znew > zold . There is a mass M of firms with high data efficiency.
The first order condition of each firm in this environment is:

to get the firm euler equation for dynamically optimal choice of capital. Note that the
Euler equation is a 2nd order equation in posterior variance: it involves Σi,t−1 (through
substituting for ki,t from equation (4)) , Σi,t , and Σi,t+1 . Alternatively, it can be expressed
a 2nd order equation in firm capital: it involves ki,t−1 , ki,t , and ki,t+1 .

At each date t, the equilibrium is characterized by the following 8 equations in 8 unknowns (Aold , Anew , kold , knew , Σold , Σnew , Y, P ):

The first pair of equations are the Euler equations for firm optimal choice of production.
The second pair determine firm posterior variance given the prior variance and production
choice last period. The third pair determine the within period productivity given firm’s
posterior variance. The last two equations determine the aggregate output and market
price given individually optimal choice of production.
Figure 2 provides the transition path from a steady state with a unit measure of old
firms, with zold = 1, to a new steady state with unit measure of old firms and measure
M of new data-savvy firms, with znew = 1.5. Parameter values are: Ā = 3, Â = 2.5,
α = 0.5, β = 0.98, γ = 0.5, P̄ = 10, r = 0.2, ρ = 0.99, σa2 = σe2 = σθ2 = 1. The initial
steady-state is given by: kold = 8.17, knew = 0.01, Σold = 0.45, Σnew = 1.49, Aold = 3.13,
Anew = 0, πold = 87.96, πnew = 0, P = 0.33, Y = 8.96. The ending steady-state is:
kold = 6.95, knew = 8.64, Σold = 0.48, Σnew = 0.33, Aold = 3.05, Anew = 3.50, πold = 79.18,
πnew = 101.2, P = 0.31, Y = 10.11. πi represents the profit of firm type i.
