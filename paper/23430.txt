Finance and Growth: Household Savings, Public Investment, and Public Health in Late Nineteenth-Century
New Jersey

JEL No. I15,N31
ABSTRACT
Saving is essential to the health of economies because it provides the wherewithal for investment.
In the late nineteenth century, saving was also essential to the health of urban working-class
households. This study brings together information from surveys of household spending and
saving, reports of savings banks and insurance companies, water and sewer authorities, and health
commissioners to illuminate the connections between household savings and health
improvements. Contemporary financial institutions positively influenced economic growth by
allocating capital to highly productive employments, including public infrastructure. Specifically,
investments in waterworks contributed to the long-run decline in typhoid infection, which
improved worker health and productivity.

“Where people who are equally industrious, intelligent and capable are competing,
the advantage in the long run will be on the side of the most thrifty.”
(Schoenfeld 1925, p.1)

1. Introduction
Understanding individual thrift is central to understanding long-run
economic development because saving is the source of capital, a principal factor of
production and one that influences labor productivity and growth. “It is because of
this relation between saving and productive capital,” writes Modigliani (1986, p. 297),
“that thrift has traditionally been regarded as a virtuous, socially beneficial act.” This
was certainly the view of early nineteenth-century policy makers who considered
individual thrift indispensible not just for long-term development but for personal
and civic well-being (Wadwhani 2002). In the late nineteenth century, individual
thrift and personal well-being were more closely connected than hitherto
understood.
This study brings together information from a wide variety of sources to
trace out the connection between working-class saving and economic growth
illustrated in Figure 1. Using information reported in five surveys of late nineteenthcentury New Jersey industrial workers, this study first documents that about one-half
of working-class households saved in a given year and that they saved as much as
12% of their annual incomes. As might be expected in an economy without a strong
safety net, households at all income percentiles engaged in net saving, though
households dissaved regularly as well, a result consistent with other studies of
contemporary working-class households (Alter et al 1994; Wadhwani 2002; Sutch
2011).

After documenting household saving behaviors, the paper explores how
households saved and with which intermediaries. It appears that working-class
households were relatively sophisticated savers who spread their savings across
available saving vehicles that, in combination, offered alternative combinations of
liquidity, risk, and return. Mutual savings banks offered liquidity and low risk (Payne
and Davis 1956; Olmstead 1976); industrial life insurance companies guaranteed
households against the unexpected death of householders (North 1979); building and
loan associations opened the door to home ownership to urban, working-class
households (Bodfish 1931; Snowden 2003); and fraternal beneficial societies offered
health and life insurance (Beito 2000; Murray 2007). One-half or more of these
institutions’ portfolios were invested in the era’s high return, high productivity
sectors such as residential housing and railroads, but one-third or more was invested
in public-sector capital.
In the 1880s, much of that public-sector investment was directed into what
Aschaeur (1989) labels core capital, mostly water and sewer infrastructure. In the last
three decades of the nineteenth-century, 94 of New Jersey’s municipalities invested
in new or upgraded waterworks, at an average cost of more than $400,000 (or about
$10 million in 2016 dollars, Williamson 2017). About 75% of the cost was financed
with 10- to 30-year municipal bonds that found their way into the portfolios of the
state’s mutual savings banks and life insurance companies. New Jersey’s workingclass savers, therefore, indirectly invested in their own community’s water
infrastructure.
New and additional municipal investments in local waterworks encouraged
the use of publicly supplied water. Once the water systems tapped into relatively
pure, water sources, typhoid mortality rates declined markedly. In Newark typhoid
mortality declined from an average of 62.2 deaths per 100,000 to 22.2; Jersey City
experienced an even more marked decline from 73.6 to 25.1 per 100,000 once its
waterworks tapped into a pure water supply. The available evidence from New Jersey
does not afford a direct test of the hypothesis, but a number of studies of other
places demonstrate a connection between decreased typhoid mortality rates and
later-life labor productivity and economic growth (Costa 2000; Ferrie and Troesken
4

2008; Case and Paxson 2009; Beach et al 2016). Thus, it seems fair to conclude that
New Jersey’s late nineteenth-century working-class households financed, at least in
part, their own health and productivity gains. One contribution of this paper is that it
documents this important channel between finance and growth that the now
extensive literature has not previously studied (Levine 1997; Bodenhorn 2016).
2. Savings mobilization, finance, and development
Financial institutions allocate and invest society’s savings, so financial
performance has important effects on capital allocation, industrial growth,
technological advancement, and economic development (Berger et al 2004). The
now extensive literature exploring the connection between finance and long-run
growth argues that financial institutions encourage growth and development because
they ameliorate transaction and information costs and facilitate the allocation of
resources across space and time in the face of risk and uncertainty (Merton and
Bodie 1995). Financial institutions provide these risk-management services by
performing five critical functions: they mobilize savings; allocate savings to
alternative investment projects; monitor and exert control over borrowers; reduce
savers’ risk by holding a diversified portfolio of investments; and facilitate trade
through the provision of exchange media (Levine 1997). Economists argue that
better financial institutions – that is, institutions that better identify creditworthy
borrowers, better mobilize savings, better pool risk, monitor better, and better
facilitate transactions – accelerate economic growth (Levine 1998). Scores of modern
finance-growth studies acknowledge the importance of all five functions, but most
follow King and Levine (1993) in their focus on private credit creation and allocation
mechanisms, particularly the efficiency with which they allocate capital, encourage
entrepreneurial enterprise, and increase total factor productivity growth.
The literature that considers the finance-growth connection in historical
contexts follows the modern approach in its focus on the allocation mechanism
mediated through the sector’s provision of the media of exchange (Rockoff 1975;
Lamoreaux 1994; Bodenhorn 2000, 2016; Rousseau and Sylla 2005). It is surprising
how little attention has been afforded the mobilization mechanism given the
financial sector’s ability to mobilize, evidence of which is the relatively high saving
5

and capital formation rates exhibited by nineteenth-century Americans (Gallman
1986). Saving mobilization is, therefore, very nearly the “forgotten half” of finance
(Adams and Vogel 1986). Financial institutions not only engage in the four lendingrelated functions; they provide deposit facilities and other repositories for household
saving.
Savings mobilization involves creating liquid, small-denomination financial
claims on large, indivisible, high-return investments. One hallmark of modern
industrial economies is the exploitation of economics of scale and scope, which
depends on the agglomeration of capital from dispersed, anonymous, small-scale
saver-investors. A second hallmark is the ability of financial intermediaries to attract
working- and middle-class savers, even if indirectly, into the market for securities
issued by enterprises large enough to exploit available economies. Intermediaries
succeed in this to the extent that they can offer secondary or derivative securities –
whether bank deposits, life insurance policies, mutual funds, and so forth – that offer
liquidity, maturity, and safety characteristics for a given real return that households
find more attractive than primary securities. One of the principal functions is for
intermediaries to transfer savings across time and space because any geographical or
temporal (maturity) correspondence between savings and investment is purely
coincidental (Wilhelm 2001). One benefit of intermediation then is that
intermediated savings moves toward investment projects that lay outside the reach or
experience of savers, who tend to be most comfortable with investments they can
see and touch and comprehend (Payne and Davis 1956).1
The nineteenth century US witnessed the emergence and expansion of
several specialized intermediaries designed to tap into pools of working- and middleclass savings – to pull it from under the proverbial mattress – and invest in a wide
variety of private and public projects. Mutual savings banks, which first appeared in
the 1810s in the nation’s commercial centers, catered to the working classes and
offered them a safe repository for modest household savings. By century’s end, the
northeastern US had more than 650 mutual savings banks with nearly 5.4 million
accounts holding deposits worth $2.1 billion, or about 1% of gross domestic

product. Building and loan associations, the precursor of the twentieth century’s
savings and loan associations, afforded working-class households opportunities to
own their own homes. Life insurance companies such as New Jersey’s Prudential
Insurance Company offered small policies for modest premiums paid weekly. And
households could insure themselves against bouts of unemployment and sickness
through small, regular payments to beneficial societies. It should be no surprise that
the working classes saved because without regular saving small misfortunes could
become dire emergencies (Adams and Vogel 1986).
3. Late nineteenth-century urban working-class household saving behaviors

Following the flow chart in Figure 1, the first step is to determine whether
New Jersey’s industrial workers saved and, if so, how much. The data used to answer
this and subsequent questions were collected, compiled, and reported by various
state bureaus and regulatory bodies. The principal source of evidence on household
saving behaviors is five reports issued by the New Jersey Bureau of Statistics of
Labor and Industries (hereafter, NJBSLI) between 1883 and 1888. Modeled after the
Massachusetts bureau headed by Carroll D. Wright, the NJBSLI conducted the same
type of annual surveys of working-class men and women. The details of the surveys
change from year to year, but certain questions appeared in each survey: the city or
town in which the household head worked; the broad industry in which he or she
worked (i.e., glass, iron, construction, etc.); a reasonably precise job title (i.e., green
bottle glass blower, puddler, plasterer, etc.); the number of hours worked per day;
typical wages by day, week or month, depending on how often the individual was
paid; the number of working days the individual was not employed due to sickness,
7

an inability to find work (which usually implied scheduled seasonal factory
shutdowns or slowdowns), and other reasons; the number of individuals in the
household; the worker’s annual income from his or her job; any additional income
aggregated up to an annual figure provided by other household members employed
outside the home; the household’s total annual expenses, sometimes broken down
into categories such as rent, food, clothing, and other expenses; and a yes-no
question indicating whether the household had accumulated any savings in the past
year or incurred any new debt. Other questions were included in some but not all
years. Despite the detail of the surveys, the bureau did not ask what now seem to be
obvious questions, such as the age of the surveyed worker or other household
members, marital status, education, or job experience.
Despite the lack of information on age and other characteristics, the surveys
contain a wealth of information on the nature of working-class household saving
behaviors that have been long neglected (Carter et al 1991), and shed light on
historical household choices. The first issue is whether late nineteenth-century
households had the wherewithal to save and, if so, did they. Table 1, which compiles
data from the five worker surveys conducted between 1883 and 1888, provides
summary statistics. Household heads’ earnings averaged between $550 and $650,
with annual fluctuations due in part to the changing industrial composition of survey
respondents. Reported earnings are consistent with estimates of GDP per worker
derived from available national income account: $686.30 in 1880 and $617.57 in 1890
(Carter et al 2006, Series Ca9-19, Ba1-10, Ba40-49). About one-third of survey
respondents reported one or more additional individuals, mostly youth, residing in
the household and working for wages. On average, they contributed between $50
and $100 per year to total household income. Total household income at the
respondents’ households then averaged between $600 and $700 per year. Median
household incomes are between $40 and $60 less than mean incomes.

The surveys also questioned respondents about household expenses for the
past year. In some years the survey asked for total household expenditures; in other
9

years the survey asked respondents to provide detailed budgets on rent, food,
clothing, sundries and other expenditures. In a single year, the surveys asked about
expenditures on life and sickness insurance, which represent saving rather than
current expenditure. Although it will generate a noisy measure, the data can be used
to calculate working-class household saving rates.
An approximate household saving rate is then calculated as the difference
between household income and expenditure all divided by household income. 2 The
implied average saving rate for all five years is 8.1%, but ranges between 4 and 10%.
If adjustments are made to account for underreported homeownership and treat life
insurance payments as savings rather than current expenditures, the five-year average
is 11.9%.3
The 1883 through 1885 surveys also afford a secondary check on the validity
of the estimated saving rates. These three surveys asked simple yes-or-no questions:
“Have you accumulated any savings during the past [current] year?” The responses
were coded as 0 (no) or 1 (yes). Approximately 40% reported saving in the past year,
and about 50% reported saving in prior years, both of which point to a culture of
working-class saving. The simple correlation coefficient between saving in the
current year and the estimated saving rate is 0.62 (p-value<0.001). Table 2 provides a
two-by-two tabulation of the zero-one response to saving in the current year with a
2

While there are subtle differences, most theories of saving define annual saving as net changes in
net wealth, which would include changes in cash holdings and durable goods, which supply a flow of
future services. Changes in net wealth are approximately the difference between disposable income
less expenditures on perishables and current services. Absent information on wealth or information
on expenditures on durables and services, the saving rate is measured as the difference between
household income less expenditure all divided by household income (e.g., saving rate= (total income –
total expenditure)/total income). This measure provides a lower bound estimate of the saving rate
because some reported expenditures would qualify as saving. The 1886 survey, for example, asked
about life insurance payments and sickness society dues (discussed in greater detail in the Section 3),
which averaged $11.10 per household. If these values are included in “Sundry” expenditures in other
years, the calculated saving rate will be below the actual rate. In addition, other households did not
report a value for house rent. In a few instances, the survey noted that the respondent owned his or
her own house. If we assume all respondents that failed to return a rent value lived in owner-occupied
housing, this implies an ownership rate of 58.1%. The Census Bureau (2017) estimates the home
ownership rate in New Jersey at 34.3% in 1900, so attributing a rental value of home ownership to the
savings of households that failed to report rent will overestimate homeownership and, therefore,
saving rates. When the owner-occupied and society dues adjustments are made to the reported
income and expenditure accounts, the five-year average saving rate increases to 12%, which is
consistent with the Alter et al (1994) estimate.
3
Saving rates for New Jersey workers are about the same as the 10% to 15% among account holders
at the Philadelphia Savings Fund Society (Alter, Goldin and Rotella 1994), though it is lower than for
industrial workers in 1880s Kansas (Sutch 2011).

zero-one transform of the estimated saving rate in which positive saving equals one
and either zero or negative saving is coded as zero. Although a substantial fraction of
workers report that they did not save during the current year and exhibit positive
value of income less expenditures, 81.5% of households are on the diagonal, which
implies a generally high level of consistency between reported savings and calculated
saving rates.

Figure 2 presents a Brady-Friedman-style (1947) graph of household saving
rates plotted against the household’s place in the income distribution reported as
percentiles. The estimated relationship is calculated using a third-degree polynominal
(fourth- and fifth-degree estimates yielded similar shapes). The graph is consistent
with three typical features of saving estimates (Deaton 1992). First, about one-third
of households report annual income equal to annual expenditure, a feature consistent
with consumer impatience. Second, households at all points in the income
distribution exhibit positive saving, but saving rates increase in income. And, third,
dissaving is common. The saving rates revealed in the graph are consistent with
nineteenth-century household saving behaviors consistent with Modigliani’s life-cycle
(Sutch 2011) and Friedman’s permanent-income hypotheses (Bodenhorn 2017).

Evidence on late nineteenth-century working-class households reveals that
their saving behaviors were largely consistent with modern approaches, but the
predictions derived from modern theory are consistent with liquidity constraints or
imperfections in capital markets (Browning and Lusardi 1996). The principal capital
market imperfection in modern theory is one in which young households prefer to
consume more early in life but cannot because capital markets preclude borrowing
against future income. Nineteenth-century householders surely faced capital market
imperfections in the sense that they found it difficult to smooth consumption by
borrowing in youth, repaying loans and saving in middle age, and dissaving in
retirement.
Early nineteenth-century households faced a more fundamental market
“imperfection,” namely the near absence of banks and other organizations that offer
services designed to solve the complex dynamic optimization problem inherent to
smoothing consumption over a person’s expected life. But the fundamental
imperfection was less of a constraint later in the century. Over the course of the
nineteenth century a handful of institutions emerged – mutual savings banks,
building and loan associations, life insurance companies, sickness and other
beneficial societies, among others – that helped working-class and middle-class
12

households realize something closer to their optimal life-cycle path of consumption
and saving.
4. Institutions and household allocations
save

Intermediary

As step three of Figure 1 makes clear, if working households saved, the
question arises about how savings were allocated across alternative outlets. By the
1880s households had several alternatives, and they made use of the alternatives in
varying proportions based on the reasons for saving and preferences for liquidity,
maturity, and divisibility. One report from the NJBSLI (1888) sheds light on the
extent to which working-class households made use of the four principal savings
vehicles available to them. In addition to the questions included in earlier surveys,
the 1888 survey inquired into whether the head of the household held an account at
a savings bank, a building and loan association, whether he or she had a life
insurance policy, or belonged to a beneficial society. The 1888 survey also inquired
into the amounts held in savings accounts and the amount of insurance, but the
response rate to the last two questions was low.

Table 4 reports mean and median values for selected statistics related to
savings, namely, household incomes, saving rates, amounts held in saving and life

was $667. The mean saving rate was 12%; the median rate was 7% for the subsample
of 625 respondents. Among the 22 respondents who reported their account
balances, the mean savings bank balance was $240, which is close to the average
balance calculated from the annual report of New Jersey’s (1881) savings banks. The
average reported value of life policies was $702, or about seven times the typical
industrial life policy and about one-half the amount of the average whole life policy
(North 1979). More than 25% of policies were for $150 or less, which is consistent
with what is known about the industrial life industry.

While Table 4 illuminates participation rates in each type of saving
organization, Schweiger and McGee (1961) contend that, in the mid-twentieth
century at least, savings banks had spillover effects. By encouraging one type of
thrift, they encouraged complementary saving behaviors. Table 5 reveals that
spillovers were modest in the late nineteenth century. Each cell in Table 5 reports the
proportion of households reporting both types of savings implied by the rowcolumn combination, along with the p-value of the Pearson chi-squared statistics
testing the null hypothesis of independence. The value in the upper left cell, for
instance, implies that 10% of households reported a savings bank account and a life
insurance policy. Five percent report a savings bank account and membership in a
building and loan association. Less than 11 percent report participating in any three
programs; and just 1.8 percent report participating in all four.
Whereas Schweiger and McGee (1961) attribute mid-century saving synergies
to savings banks, in the late nineteenth century fraternal societies created greater
synergies. Ten percent of households were simultaneously savings bank and
beneficial society members. Nearly a third reported society membership and life
insurance; and 17% reported a combination of society and building and loan
memberships. The data on late-nineteenth century household saving demonstrates
that households saved, they saved in a variety of ways, and they saved in
combinations that suggest some degree of sophistication. Working-class families did
15

not rely on stuffing a few dollars under the mattress; many took advantage of the
available formal financial institutions.

must choose how to allocate the funds savers entrust to them. They might invest in
private capital, in public capital, or in some combination of the two. And if they
choose to investment in public capital, they must decide between investing in socalled core capital (primarily water, sewer, and other health infrastructure), or other
public infrastructure capital (roads, bridges, schools, and so on).
By these criteria beneficial societies and building and loan societies do not
qualify as a genuine intermediary. Beneficial societies operated, for philosophical
reasons, as close to pay-as-you-go systems as they could. They rarely accumulated
more than a minimal reserve fund. Instead, they relied on current premium payments
and assessments to meet current claims (New York Insurance Department 1888).
Similarly, building and loan associations were highly specialized financial firms that
were required to direct nearly all their resources to the residential mortgages of
members (Bodfish 1931; Clark and Chase 1925). Building and loans served a vital
16

function in a rapidly urbanizing economy (Snowden 2003), but they were not
traditional intermediaries in the sense that they held diversified portfolios or
mortgage and non-mortgage investments of members and nonmembers alike.

What of savings banks and industrial life insurance companies? Among the
financial institutions that served working-class Americans, they qualify as
intermediaries. Given the growth and profitability of such investments, savings banks
and insurance companies, like building associations, invested between one-third and
one-half of their assets in residential mortgages. Unlike building associations,
however, savings banks and insurance companies held more diversified portfolios.
Several features stand out in Table 6, which reports New Jersey’s savings banks’ and
insurance companies’ portfolio allocations. First, both reduced their holdings of US
debt during the 1880s. Second, neither initially held a sizeable fraction of their
portfolios in railroad securities, but the fraction increased markedly among insurance
companies. By decade’s end, about one-fifth of insurance investments were in
railroads. Third, insurance companies began the decade holding 11.2% of their assets
in municipal debt, but the proportion fell to 2.3% by the end of the decade. New
Jersey’s savings banks, on the other hand, increased the fraction of their portfolios in
17

municipal debt from 8.2% to 23.0%. Regulatory restrictions imposed limits on the
savings banks’ ability to fully diversify; up to 1870 the list of authorized securities
included residential mortgages, federal, state, and municipal debt, promissory notes
with collateral, commercial bank deposits, and securities issued by railroads chartered
by New Jersey (Keyes 1878).
This raises concerns about savings banks as intermediaries. It is possible that
in restricting the banks’ assets to mortgages and public debt, regulations might have
limited any growth-enhancing intermediation. But the 1880s witnessed significantly
increased investments in public infrastructure, notably water and sewer facilities.
Table 7 reports the mean and median values for the year in which 94 New Jersey
municipalities with pre-1900 water-works completed their systems, the amount
invested, and the amount financed through long-term debt issues. The mean year in
which these communities constructed a water-works was 1883, at an average total
cost of $420,600, of which $339,000 was financed through the issuance of long-term,
typically 10- to 30-year, bonds. Cutler and Miller (2006) argue that larger cities
operated municipally owned systems, because the capital investments were generally
beyond the capacity of private firms, while smaller cities and towns tended to
contract with private water companies. New Jersey’s municipalities demonstrate the
same pattern. The mean municipal system cost five times the mean private system.
In New Jersey, as elsewhere, the ability of municipalities to borrow long term
was an important part of the era’s push toward clean water, but the evidence
concerning the effect of public ownership on water quality relative to private
ownership is mixed (Troesken 1999; Troesken and Geddes 2003; Cutler and Miller
2006). In his history of urban infrastructure, Melosi (2000, p. 75) contends that a
city’s capacity to construct water-works depended on more than the political will to
do so; it relied on “the ability of cities to incur debts,” and the capacity of cities to
tap financial markets “ultimately made the development of public sanitary systems
achievable.” Absent the ability to place long-term debt, municipalities found that
providing infrastructure “strained available [municipal] resources” to such as extent
that “developing adequate water and sewer infrastructure seemed an insurmountable
task” (Beemer et al 2005, pp. 49-50).

Mutual savings banks’ and industrial life insurance companies’ willingness to
invest in municipal debt allowed New Jersey’s cities to surmount the insurmountable.
Newark’s Comptroller (1886, p.7) argued that the city’s long-term bonds were
“sought by investors as safe and reliable securities,” which enabled Newark and
other cities to place them. But municipalities did not rely on sophisticated financial
markets to place them; most issues were too small to interest investment banks. Of
Newark’s 29 separate water bond issues between 1876 and 1897, 12 were less than
$20,000; seven were between $20,000 and $50,000; and five more were for less than
$100,000 (Newark Comptroller 1906, p.10). The city placed its bonds by handing
them over to the construction company awarded the contract for the work. In 1891,
for example, the East Jersey Water Company won the bid for a new $4 million water
plant and pumping station and, even for this relatively large bond issue, took the
19

city’s 4% bonds at par in payment. The arrangement made “settlement for the new
water supply … very easy for the city,” because it imposed the cost of placing the
securities on the contracting firm (Newark Comptroller 1892, p.4).
Once they accepted municipal bonds in payment, water-works contractors
had to locate investors and most surely turned to New Jersey’s and New York’s
savings banks and industrial insurance companies. Table 8 reports the total value of
outstanding water-works debt and all municipal debt for 26 municipalities whose
debt was listed in the Commercial and Financial Chronicle. The table also reports the
share of all municipal debt held by New Jersey’s mutual savings banks and life
insurance companies operating in the state. In 1892 about one-third of all municipal
debt had been issued to finance water-works. Savings banks and insurance
companies combined held 40% to 45% of the bonds of the two municipalities with
the most expensive water-works – Jersey City and Newark. They also held substantial
proportions of the debt of Asbury Park, Bayonne, Rahway and Trenton. For the 26
municipalities combined, savings banks held 10.9% of their debt; life insurance
companies held 26.7%. Two of the principal saving vehicles for New Jersey’s
working-class households, therefore, intermediated between the state’s savers and
municipalities constructing the water-works that served saving households
themselves. Mutual savings banks and industrial life companies transformed workers’
savings into investments in water and sewer systems that, in the long run, helped
improve urban workers’ health and productivity.

Now that it has been shown that savings banks and industrial life insurance
companies invested substantial amounts in public core capital, the subsection of
Figure 1 reproduced here reminds us that the issue arises whether such investments
paid off in terms of improvements in public health. The evidence is generally
consistent with improved health, but supplying homes with municipally supplied
water was not enough if the water was impure.
Between 1860 and 1890 the average daily per capita water consumption in
Jersey City doubled. Daily per capita consumption was 52 gallons in 1860, which
rose to 98 gallons in 1887 (Jersey City Board of Public Works 1887). Table 9
provides statistics of water usage (gals per day per capita) in 1897 and 1915 and taps
into system (taps per capita) in 1897 for select New Jersey municipalities. Baker’s
(1897) estimates for cities with large working-class populations – Camden, Elizabeth,
Jersey City, Millville, Newark, and Trenton – are about 100 gallons per day per
person. Some of the differences across cities result from the extent to which
industrial and commercial enterprises tapped into the various systems (manufacturers
in Patterson, for instance, apparently drew water directly from the Passaic River),
whether water usage was metered (not yet universal), and how well municipal water
agencies maintained chronically leaky mains and pipes (Jersey City Board of Public
Works 1887). Daily per capita consumption was higher in 1915 than in 1897 in the
handful of cities for which data is available (Mason 1916). The number of taps, or
connections, ranged from a low of 0.07 per capita in Millville to 0.29 in Asbury Park.
Multiplying taps per capita by four approximates the number of connections per
household. As elsewhere in the United States, the provision of water by way of
municipal pipes rather than well pumps dramatically increased usage (Melosi 2000).

Cutler and Miller (2006) argue that the political and economic impetus
behind the late nineteenth-century push toward the provision of abundant, cheap
and clean water lies less in the recognition of the connection between clean water
and waterborne diseases, such as cholera, dysentery, and typhoid, than in the ability
of cities to tap into expanding and modernizing financial markets. People had long
recognized the correlation between impure water and chronic urban diarrheal
diseases, as well as the occasional acute outbreak, even if they did not understand the
causal mechanism. Late nineteenth-century observers were especially concerned with
typhoid, claiming that for every typhoid death avoided three additional premature
deaths were avoided. The effect is attributed not the elimination of typhoid per se,
which had a relatively low mortality rate among those who contracted the disease,
but to the fact that typhoid compromised the immune system. Prior typhoid

23

infection increased the probability of early death from other infections, such as
tuberculosis, pneumonia, and influenza (Ferrie and Troesken 2008).

Typhoid death rates for three New Jersey cities in the Passaic River
watershed reported in Table 10 reveal that the installation of water and sewer
systems alone did not resolve the typhoid problem if the water moving through the
system was drawn from rivers contaminated by upstream pollutants. Newark and
Jersey City drew their water from the Passaic River, which was known as early as
1887 to be heavily polluted with sewage and industrial wastes dumped by the
24

upstream cities of Paterson and Passaic (Newark Board of Health 1887).4 Until 1892
typhoid death rates in Newark remained high and on par with other cities, like
Pittsburgh, that relied on adjacent rivers for city water (Beach et al 2016). After 1892
Newark drew most of its water from the less polluted Pequanock River with
additional supplies from deep wells at Belleville (Newark Department of Public
Health 1899).
Following the change in the source the city’s water financed through direct
placement of its debt, typhoid death rates fell immediately in Newark. Jersey City
switched to Pequanock-supplied water only in 1897, after which its typhoid death
rates also fell. By century’s end, typhoid mortality rates in Newark and Jersey City fell
below the upstream Patterson rate of 35 to 40 per 100,000. Additional declines in
typhoid rates awaited the adoption of water filtration and chlorination, as well as the
elimination of urban privy vaults and cesspools, which remained “fertile sources of
disease” because they contaminated surrounding soil and leached into private wells
(Billings 1897, p.134). Despite the public provision of water, Newark’s Board of
Health (1887) reported 1,129 private wells still in use, the occasional contamination
of which may account for periodic spikes in typhoid mortality.

Typhoid rates in Camden (downstream) and Trenton (upstream) each of which drew its water from
the Delaware River reveal similar differentials. The average typhoid death rate in Camden between
1880 and 1900 was 76.8 compared to Trenton’s 32.5 (NJ Board of Health 1880-1900).

25

Did savings banks’ and life insurance companies’ willingness to invest in
municipal bonds that financed water and sewer investments positively influence
economic growth? Unfortunately, the available evidence from New Jersey does not
provide a direct test, but there is evidence from other places consistent with the
hypothesis. Beginning with Aschauer (1989) several articles have investigated
whether public investments promote aggregate economic or total factor productivity
(TFP) growth. Aschauer (1989) includes public capital in a standard Solow growth
model, first, to provide a theoretical foundation for why water and sewer services,
roads and other public capital might influence growth, and, second, to generate
econometric estimates of any effect. For the postwar US, he finds that a 1% increase
in the stock of public capital is associated with a 0.39% increase in total factor
productivity growth. The effect of “core” infrastructure, defined as roads, and watersewer investments, is such that a 1% increase in core capital is associated with a
0.24% increase in TFP growth.
Aschauer’s (2000) subsequent study takes into account Hulten’s (1996) and
Barro’s (1991) criticisms and still finds that the net effect of debt-financed public
infrastructure is positive, significant, and meaningful. His estimates also imply that
the optimal public capital-output ratio is about 0.5, but that the mean ratio in 46 lowand middle-income countries is 1.32. It is possible that many modern economies,
even low-income ones, have overinvested in public capital. This possibility hardly
seems a concern for late nineteenth-century Newark or Jersey City. Overflowing
urban privies and muddy streets were common features of most contemporary urban
places, and “manifest physical representations of the city’s problems” (Cain 1972,
p.371). Citizens agreed to tax assessments to finance sanitary conditions, which
benefitted all the city’s residents but may have benefitted the working poor relatively
more (Troesken 2001).
Aschauer’s findings have not gone unchallenged, of course, but the weight of
the evidence suggests that public capital, even debt-financed public capital, increases
private sector growth. Barro (1991) finds it for a sample of 76 countries. Easterly and
Rebelo (1993) find it for 100 countries. Nourzad and Vrieze (1995) find the effects in
OECD countries. Harchaoui et al (2004) find it in post-1960 Canada. And a metaanalysis of 68 studies (578 separate estimates) suggests a short-run output elasticity to
26

central-government public capital of 0.08 and a long-run elasticity of 0.12. The
elasticities of core capital by local and regional governments are nearly double these
values (Born and Ligthart 2013). Alternative approaches also tend to support the
productivity enhancing effects of core public capital. Invoking the cost-dual,
Morrison and Schwartz (1996) estimate cost functions for manufacturing firms and
find substantial cost savings attributable to public investment.
A growing literature in economic history makes use of newly constructed
longitudinal data sets to address the connection between disease eradication efforts
and long-run growth. Bleakley (2007), for example, finds that the Rockefeller
Foundation’s hookworm eradication program in the southern US increased school
enrollments, literacy and, importantly, the returns to education three decades later.
Childhood hookworm infection reduced later-life wages (and by implication
productivity) by approximately 40%. Similar effects on school enrollments and laterlife health resulted from malaria eradication efforts in the South (Bleakley 2003).
Beach et al (2014) provide the first analysis of the long-run effects of typhoid
exposure in the early twentieth century. They estimate that eliminating early-life
exposure to typhoid increased educational attainment and later-life earnings by
between 1% and 9%. Their results are consistent with Case and Paxson’s (2009)
findings that early exposure to typhoid reduced cognitive function among surviving
50 to 90 year-olds and Costa’s (2000) finding that early exposure negatively affects
late-life cardiac and respiratory function. By reducing the fraction of impaired
individuals, whether cognitively or physically, by early-life exposure to typhoid and
other waterborne diseases, the construction and modernization of New Jersey’s late
nineteenth-century waterworks surely contributed to long-term human capital
development and, thereby, to economic development.
Savings banks and industrial life insurance companies played no small part by
making markets in the municipal debt that financed the urban waterworks with
documented effects on long-term productivity. Intermediaries also invested in
municipal bonds that financed the construction of schools, urban street lights, roads
and bridges, and a host of other public investments that complemented private
capital.

27

6. Concluding comments
Saving is essential to the health of economies and households, yet relatively
little historical scholarship investigates saving behaviors among the urban working
class in the nineteenth century. This paper uses five surveys of industrial workers in
1880s New Jersey, an analysis of which reveals relatively sophisticated saving
practices consistent with life-cycle and precautionary approaches. Estimated saving
rates are consistent with three features evident in modern developing economies:
some households saved little or nothing, consistent with consumer impatience;
regular dissaving points to prior saving in the face of the era’s uncertain incomes;
and saving rates rose with income (Deaton 1991).
Moreover, households took advantage of nearly every type of saving
institution. Two of the more common outlets for household saving – mutual savings
banks and industrial life insurance companies – then allocated mobilized savings into
highly productive sectors, including public infrastructure. More than one-third of the
combined assets of New Jersey’s mutual savings banks and industrial life companies
were invested in municipal debt, much of which was issued to finance public
infrastructure. Investments in core public capital, notably public waterworks and
sewer systems, had positive effects on health. As the state’s municipalities
constructed new or upgraded existing waterworks between 1870 and 1890, the
incidence of typhoid declined markedly. Historical health economists document the
longer term negative health and productivity consequences of typhoid and other
diseases. A diminution in the incidence of such infections likely led to increases in
labor productivity and, ultimately, on long-run growth. It might be fairly concluded,
then, that New Jersey’s working-class savers exhibited what Modigliani (1986, p.297)
and Wadhwani (2002) labeled the civic virtue of saving. Working-class savings,
mediated through the era’s available financial institutions, redounded to their own
benefit.
