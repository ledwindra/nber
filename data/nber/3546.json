Instead, the Federal Reserve acted - disastrously - as if the gathering Great Depression could not be avoided, and was best endured.  Such a  liquidationist' theory of depressions was in fact common before the Keynesian Revolution, and was held and advanced by economists like Kayek and Schumpeter.  This paper tries to reconstruct the logic of the liquidationist' view.  It argues that the perspective was carefully thought out (although not adequate to the Depression), may hold some truth in other times and places, and could be the core of a more productive research program that currently popular real' business cycle theories.\n\n",
