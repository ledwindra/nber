Interest Rates,. Money Supply
Announcements, and Monetary
Base Announcements

7\BSTRACT

This paper presents a new set of empirical regularities on the link
between interest rates, money supply announcements and monetary base
anno*mcements. Among the main findings reported are: (i) unexpected
increases in the announced monetary base have a significantly positive
effect on interest rates during the period from October 1979 to October
1982; (ii) although unexpected money supply and monetary base announcements
have the seine impact on interest rates, they have different implications for
the future behavior of the money supply and monetary base; (iii) the
significant response of longer-term interest rates to unexpected monetary
announcements is reflecting a response of current and expected future shortterm rates -term-structure premia are not altered by these
announcements.

I. Introduction

Recent empirical research on the effects of weekly money supply

announcements has produced a number of interesting findings.1 Unexpected
increases in the announced money supply have a positive and statistically
significant impact on the interest rates of both short-term and long-term
assets. The magnitude and significance of these impacts show a marked
increase following the October 6, 1979 change in the Federal Reserve's

operating procedures. Expected increases in the announced money supply
generally have a negative effect on interest rates, but the statistical
significance of the effect depends on the time period being examined and on
the method of measuring expectations.

Although these findings are informative, a number of important
questions remain unanswered. For example, are money supply announcements

affecting interest rates because of the information they convey about the
monetary base or about the money multiplier? Are there effects of the weekly
monetary base announcements on interest rates? Do interest rates respond to
the weekly announcements of money supply and monetary base revisions? What
are the predictive implications of monetary announcements for the expected
future behavior of the money supply and monetary base? Is the interest rate-

monetary announcement link altered at the time of the October 1982 shift in
Federal Reserve operating procedure? Are the effects of monetary
announcements on long-term interest rates capturing their effects on
expected future short-term interest rat;s or on term-structure premia?
The main purpose of this paper is to provide answers to these
questions. In addition, the robustness of previously reported findings is
examined. Thus, the contribution is to present a new, expanded set of

2

empirical regularities which characterize the monetary announcement-interest
rate link. The key results reported in the paper are:
(i) There is a significant positive link between monetary base

announcements and interest rates, a relation which previous researchers have

either ignored or failed to detect Allowing for this link does not alter
the strength of the relation between money supply announcements and interest
rates. The hypothesis that unexpected monetary base and money supply
announcements have the same impact on interest rates cannot be statistically
rejected at standard significance levels. Given the delays in announcing
monetary data, a money supply announcement provides new information about
only the money multiplier. Thus,

interest

rates significantly respond to new

information about both the monetary base and the money multiplier.
(ii) Significant interest rate responses to monetary announcements

exist

only for announcements of preliminary

data. Announcements of money

supply and monetary base revisions do not have a significant impact on
interest

rates.

(iii)

During the time period when announcements have their largest

impact on interest rates, both unexpected money supply and monetary base
announcements contain useful information for predicting future monetary
developments. An unexpected increase in the announced money supply can be
used to predict subsequent money supply contractions. These contractions
only partially offset the initial expansion, however, so that higher levels
of the money supply can be expected to prevail in periods after such an
announcement. Despite this information about subsequent money supplies,

unexpected money supply announcements generally have no predictive power for
future levels of the monetary base. An unexpected increase in the announced
monetary base signals different monetary developments than an unexpected

3

increase in the announced money supply. It can be used to predict lower
money supplies in the future as well as subsequent changes in the monetary
base. An unexpected increase in the announced monetary base is followed by a
significant contraction of the base which only partially offsets the initial
change. The finding that unexpected money supply and monetary base
announcements have different predictive implications but have similar
effects on interest rates casts doubt on the proposition that the observed
monetary announcement-interest rate link can be fully accounted for in terms
of the new information they convey about future money supply and monetary
base behavior.
(iv) Following the October 1982 shift in the Federal Reserve's

operating procedure there was a statistically significant change in the

monetary announcement-interest rate relation. The impact of monetary
announcements on interest rates is much smaller after the Federal Reserve
began to downplay its conmiittment to hitting a target growth rate of the Ml

money supply. There are also changes in the ability of unexpected
announcements to predict future monetary developments.

(v) The rise in long-term interest rates following an unexpected
increase in the announced money supply and monetary base appears to result
only from the movement of current and expected future short-term interest
rates. That is, there is no evidence of a significant response of termstructure premia to unexpected monetary announcements.

(vi) Some previous empirical work on the link between monetary
announcements and interest rates in the pre-October 1979 period may be

misleading for two reasons. First, changes in interest rate volatility from
1977 to 1979 have the consequence that interest rate regressions estimated

over this period exhibit significant heteroskedasticity. Failure to take

4

account of this can result in improper statistical inference. Second, and
more importantly, an examination of the role of influential data points
shows that before 1979 the statistically significant link between monetary
announcements and interest rate changes is attributable to a relatively few
data points.

The paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the data and
introduces notation. Section III presents results concerning the impact of
expected and unexpected money supply announcements on the interest rate for
three-month U.S. Treasury bills. Three sample periods are examined: preOctober 1979, October 1979-October 1982, and post-October 1982. Section IV
assesses the stability of these results, both within arid across samples, as

well as the role of potentially influential observations. The interest rate
effects of monetary base announcements are analyzed in section V. This
section also examines whether interest rates respond to announced revisions
of previously reported money supply and monetary base data. Section VI
evaluates the predictive ability of unexpected monetary announcements for
the subsequent behavior of the money supply and the monetary base. The
effects of monetary announcements on longer-term interest rates are
investigated in section VII. This section also provides evidence on whether
the reaction of longer-term interest rates to the annnouncements reflects a
change in expected future short-term rates and/or a change in term-structure
premia. Section VIII contains concluding remarks.

II. Notation and Data Description

Four sources of data are used in this paper. The weekly H.6 release of
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System is used for money
supply data. During the time period examined here, September 29, 1977 to

March 29, 1984, this release contains a preliminary announcement of the
average money supply over the week ending approximately nine days ago and
the announcement of a revised estimate of the average money supply over the

week ending approximately sixteen days ago. These variables are subscripted
by the week in which they become known. The preliminary money supply
announcement which is released in week t is denoted Mt and the revised
estimate which is released at this time is denoted MLRt.

Up until January 31, 1980, the H.6 release was scheduled to be made
public every Thursday at 4:10 p.m. The regularly scheduled time was changed
to Friday at 4:10 p.m. beginning with the February 8, 1980 announcement.

Friday announcements remained the rule until February 10, 1984. Beginning
with the February 16, 1984 announcement the scheduled release time was
returned to Thursday at 4:10 p.m. Despite this schedule, actual
announcements are not always made at the regularly scheduled time due to
factors such as holidays and delays in gathering data. This fact has been
taken into account in the construction of the data set.

The definition of money used in this paper is Ml from the beginning of
the sample until January 31, 1980 and from January 15, 1982 until the end of
the sample, but is Mi-B from February 8, 1980 until January 8, 1982. These
dates for switching the definition of money correspond to the dates at which
the definitions change in the published data. Until February 10, 1984 the
weekly money supply data are daily averages from Thursday to Wednesday,

6

while beginning February 16, 1984 they are daily averages from Tuesday to
Monday.

The weekly H.9 press release of the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System contains monetary base data. This release is available only
from March 15, 1979 until February 10, 1984. Although, the regularly
scheduled time for the H.9 release is the same as for the H.6 release, there
are weeks when the two releases are not made on the same day. When examining
the interest rate effects of both money supply and monetary base
announcements, data for these weeks are not used in the analysis.

The timing of the data in the H.9 release differs from the timing of
the data in the H.6 release; the preliminary announcement is for the average
monetary base during the week ending approximately two days ago and the
revised estimate is for the average monetary base during the week ending
approximately nine days ago. The preliminary monetary base announcement
which is released in week t is denoted

and the revised estimate which is

released in week t is denoted BLRt. The monetary base announcements are
always for a week ending Wednesday.

The fact that monetary base announcements are made with a two day delay
and that money supply announcments are made with a nine day delay is

important for understanding what information is being revealed by a money
supply announcement. When an announcement is made in week t about the money
supply in week t-l, the monetary base for week t-l has already been
announced. Thus, the money supply announcement provides new information
about only the money multiplier.

The monthly G.13 press release of the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System provides interest rate data. The release contains daily
interest rates for U.S. Treasury bills of three-, six-, and twelve-month

7

maturity. The

rates are from dealer quotations in the secondary market, at

approximately 3:30 p.m.. Given this timing, the interest rates available for

of

the day

a money supply or monetary base armounceulent are rates before the

announcement.

Money Market Services, a Belmont, California based corporation which

has

conducted

telephone surveys of approximately fifty government securities

dealers since late 1977, has kindly provided their weekly measure of money

supply announcement forecasts. Money Market Services conducts their surveys
every Tuesday, asking for an estimate of the money supply change that will
be announced later in the week. The data were made available beginning with
the announcement made on September 29, 1977 and ending with the announcement
made on March 29, 1984. The series used here,

XMESt,

is

the median forecast

of all those surveyed.

III. The Money Supply Announcement-Interest Rate Relation

This section presents results which extend the widely documented
relation between money supply announcements

and

interest rates through March

1984. In particular, the first three regressions presented in Table 1
relate the change in the interest rate on three-month U.S. Treasury bills

8

(DR3 R3A R3B) to the unexpected and expected components of money supply
announcements. The weekly announcement of a change in the money supply has
been decomposed into expected and unexpected components (XMESt and

XMUSt

M- MLRt XMES) using

the Money Market Services survey measure of

expectations.2 The data have been divided into three samples with A.l
covering September 29, 1977 to October 4., 1979, 3.1 covering

October 11, 1979 to October 15, 1982, and C.l covering October 22, 1982 to

March 29, l984.
The regression results show a positive and statistically significant
link between unexpected money supply announcements and interest rates in all

three periods examined.4 Further, the magnitude of the interest rate change
in response to news about the money supply varies considerably across

samples. In the pre-October 1979 period an unexpected increase of one
billion dollars in the announcid money supply raises the annualized interest

rate on three-month U.S. Treasury bills by less than two basis points. From
October 1979 to October 1982 the impact is over four times as large, nearly

nine basis points. From October 1982 to March 1984 the impact drops back to
just over three basis points. The substantial rise in the magnitude of the
impact that unexpected money supply announcements have on interest rates

after October 1979 is mostly reversed after October l982.
Higher expected money announcements are associated with decreases in
interest rates in all samples. While expected money supply announcements do
not have significant explanatory power for interest rate changes pre-October
1979 or post-October 1982, they do have significant explanatory power from
October 1979 to October 1982.6 The existence of a predictable change in the
interest rate has often been interpreted as evidence against an efficient

bond market. However, this interpretation need not be correct. No violation
of bond market efficiency can be determined without explicitly considering

9

the nature of the risk involved with basing portfolio decisions on expected
interest rate changes.

Also of interest in the results of Table 1 are the standard errors of
the regressions, which are consistent with the well-known high level of
interest rate volatility for the period October 1979 to October 1982. During
this period, the standard deviation of the daily change in the interest rate
that cannot be explained by money supply announcements is over three times

larger than it is in the preceding and subsequent periods. Despite the high
standard error of the regression in the October 1979 to October 1982 period,

however, the adjusted R2 is approximately the same during the entire postOctober 1979 sample. Money supply announcements explain between 25% and 30%
of the one day movement in interest rates during this time.

IV. Stability and the Importance of Influential Observations

The differences in the magnitude of the impact that money supply
announcements have on interest rates in different time periods appear

sufficiently large to justify the contention that the relation has not been
constant over time. Such differences may also lead one to question the

stability of the money supply announcement-interest rate link within each of
the sample periods in Table 1. This section demonstrates that the relation
is apparently stable within the October 1979 to October 1982 and postOctober 1982 samples but not within the pre-October 1979 sample. The
instability is linked to the role of a relatively few influential

observations and to significant heteroskedasticity. After accounting for the
instability in the pre-1979 sample, it is shown that the money supply

10

announcement-interest rate relation is significantly different across the
pre-October 1979, October 1979 to October 1982 and post-October 1982
samples.

The issue of within sample stability is addressed by the test
statistics found in the last two columns of Table 1. The number in
parentheses below a test statistics is its marginal significance level, so
that a value less than .05 indicates rejection of the null hypothesis at the
5% level. The last column provides the standard Chow test statistic for
testing coefficient stability within the sample.' The column entitled G-Q
TEST is a Goldfeld-Quandt test for heteroskedasticity, where the
observations are ordered chronologically.8 This test was used to uncover any
time trend behavior in the variance of the regression error.
For the October 1979 to October 1982 and post-October 1982 samples,

neither the hypothesis of coefficent stability nor the hypothesis of
constant error variance can be rejected using standard significance levels.

In the pre-October 1979 sample, however, it is possible to reject both
hypotheses at the 5% significance level.

Some insight into the nature of the instability of the money supply
announcement-interest rate relation in the pre-October 1979 period can be

obtained by examining the scatter plots displayed in Figures 1 and 2. Due
to the near orthogonality of XMUS

and XMES,

bivariate scatter plots of DR3 vs. XMIJS

it is useful to examine

(Figure

1) and DR3 vs. XMES

(Figure 2). The primary points of interest in Figure 1 are the
observations for April 26, 1979 (denoted as point a) and for

November 9, 1978 (denoted as point b). These points appear to be
influential in the sense that dropping them from the sample would noticeably
reduce the estimated coefficient on XMUS. Since both of these points fall in

the second half of the sample, it is not surprising that the Chow test

indicates coefficient instability)0 Figure 2 shows the observations for
April 26, 1979 and November 9, 1978 in the bivariate scatter plot of DR3 vs.
XMES.

The effect of dropping the influential points mentioned above is shown
in the results for sample A.2 in Table 1 . The significant impact that

unexpected money supply announcements have on interest rate changes is lost
when the two influential points are omitted from the sample. The estimated
impact drops by over 50%, from 1.77 basis points to 0.80. Also of interest
in the results for sample A.2 is the fact that while dropping the

influential points is apparently sufficient to tabi1ize the estimated
coefficients, it is not sufficient to eliminate the heteroskedasticity of

the error term. A closer examination of the data indicated that the
heteroskedasticity was caused by an error variance which grows over the

sample. Dropping the observations before March 30, 1978, in addition to the
influential points, is sufficient to construct a pre-October 1979 sample

which has both constant coefficients and constant error variance) The
effect of dropping these observations is shown in the results for sample A.3

in Table 1. In this sample neither unexpected nor expected money supply
announcements have a significant impact on interest rate changes.

Determining whether there was a significant link between money supply
announcements and interest rates during the pre-October 1979 period is

difficult in light of the results for samples A.2 and A.3. That is, the
observations for April 26, 1979 and November 9, 1978 are clearly
influential, but they cannot be considered "outliers" or "bad" observations
without additional information. Interestingly, Grossman (1981) and Roley
(1982,1983) report estimates of the impact of unexpected money supply

12

announcement on interest rates which are close to those reported in Table 1
for sample A.2, i.e. for the sample which drops influential observations.12
Since these authors measure interest rate changes over a one and a half hour
interval

on the

interval

considered here, the influential points appear to be a reflection

day of the announcement instead of the twenty four hour

of interest rate movements which are occurring during the day
announcement.

supply

Presumably, this is a

following

the

reaction to events other than the money

announcement and it seems appropriate to delete the influential

observations when measuring the impact of money supply announcements.
Figures 3 through 6 contain the same type of information as Figures 1

and 2, but for different time periods. Figures 3 and 4 are for October 1979
through October 1982 while Figures 5 and 6 are for post-October 1982. The
scatter plots are informative, even though regression diagnostics indicate

no apparent instability during these latter time periods. Examination of
Figures 3 through 6 shows that, in contrast to the results for pre-October
1979, during the latter periods there is no obvious, small set of points
which underly the statistically significant relations reported in Table 1.
The relation between unexpected money supply announcements and interest
rates is seen in Figures 3 and 5 to be a result which appears characteristic
of the entire sample. Figure 4 illustrates a similar finding for the link
between expected money announcements and interest rates.
The final issue addressed in this section is the stability of the money
supply announcement-interest rate link across the three stable periods
identified in the regressions of Table 1. The statistics presented at the
bottom of the table test the null hypothesis that the coefficients

a1 and a2

are equal in the two, or three, samples indicated.13 They indicate that the
October 1979 to October 1982 period is significantly different from the

Note: DR3 is the change in the annualized interest rate on three-month U.S.
Treasury bills from the close of the market on the day of a money
supply announcement to the close of the market on the following day,
measured in basis points. XMES is the expected change in the money
supply announcement, based on the Money Market Services survey and
measured in billions of dollars. A '*, represents other, possibly
multiple, observations. There are a total of 75 observations,
representing weekly data from October 22, 1982 to March 29, 1984.
The observation for February 14, 1983 has not been plotted since
there appears to be a typographical error in the money supply revision
announced on that date.

other periods examined.14 The joint hypothesis that after October 1982 the
coefficients a1 and

return to their pre-October 1979 values cannot be

rejected using a 5% significance level. Closer inspection of the individual
coefficients, however, indicates that there was a significant change in

a1,

the only coefficient which is significantly different from zero in either
period. The Chow test for testing the equality of a1 in the pre.October 1979
and post-October 1982 periods is 5.66 (marginal significance level of .019).
Combining the results of testing within-sample and across-sample

stability leads to the conclusion that from 1977 to 1984 the money supply
announcement-interest rate link is composed of three distinct relations. For
the pre-October 1979 period no statistically significant, stable relation
between money supply announcements and interest rates is apparent.15 For the
October 1979 to October 1982 period there is a significant, positive

association between unexpected money supply announcements and interest rate
changes and a significant negative relation between expected money supply
announcements and interest rate changes. For the post-October 1982 period,
the positive link between unexpected money supply announcements and interest
rate changes remains statistically significant but their impact diminishes.

There is no significant link between expected money supply announcements and
interest rates post-October 1982.

V. Interest Rates, Monetary Base Announcements, and Data Revisions

The money supply is the product of the monetary base and the money
multiplier. As previously explained, given the delays in releasing monetary
data, money supply announcements convey new information about only the money

14

multiplier. A natural question which arises from this observation is, do the
weekly monetary base announcements provide any additional information
relevant for interest rate determination? The evidence presented in this
section shows that unexpected monetary base announcements do have a
statistically significant impact on interest rates during the period from

October 1979 to October 1982. After October 1982, the effect of unexpected
monetary base announcements diminishes and becomes statistically
insignificant. Another question examined in this section is, do weekly
announcements of money supply and monetary base revisions affect interest

rates? It is shown that much previous research has constrained the interest
rate impact of revisions and preliminary data announcements to be equal.

While this constraint cannot be rejected, neither can the hypothesis that
revision announcements have no effect on interest rates.
As mentioned in section II, weekly money supply announcements contain
two sources of information. There is an announced change in the money

supply, DM Mt Mi, and an announced revision of a previously reported
money supply, NRVt_

The impact that these two announcements have

on interest rates has been constrained in previous work. The most widely

used constraint is that the impact of DM is equal in magnitude to the
impact of MRVt, but is of the opposite sign. This constraint is used in

previous sections since the series which was decomposed into an expected and

unexpected component was XM1— DM V. Another constraint which has been
used is that MRV has no impact on interest rates, so that the series DMt is
decomposed into expected and unexpected components.

Imposing constraints on the way interest rates react to the two
announcements is necessary if one wishes to measure expectations exclusively

by survey data because only one survey series is available. Nevertheless,

15

the constraints which have been imposed do not necessarily hold for the data
being examined. A more general approach, one which would not impose these
constraints, is desirable.

This more general approach is made operational in this section by

decomposing both DM and

into their expected and unexpected components

and relating interest rate changes to these four variables in an
unconstrained manner. The decompositions are done in two ways. First, both

DMt and MRV are decomposed into expected and unexpected components using
linear regressions. The regressors are a constant, the survey measure of

expectations, the most recent change in the money supply (DM1 M1

revision in the money supply (MRVti Mt1 M2) change in the
monetary base t-l Bt-l B2), and revision in the monetary base

(BRV1 t-l B2) available before the announcement, the most recently
available weekly change in the interest rate on three-month U.S. Treasury

bills (DR3B R3B R3B1) and the spread between the interest rates on
three- and six-month U.S. Treasury bills prior to the announcement (SPR_

R6B R3B). Thus, the survey information is supplemented by information
from interest rates and past monetary announcements. The interest rate

variables DR3B and SPRt differ from the other regressors because they may
contain useful information which becomes available after the survey is

conducted butbefore the monetary announcements. The variables constructed
from these regressions are DMUR (unexpected DMt formed from regression),

DMER (expected DMt formed from regression), VURt, and MRVER.

The second decomposition is based on the assumption that the survey
measure of expectations does not contain a forecast of the money supply

revision, i.e. it is measuring expectations of DMt, not XM. This
assumption, which will be shown to be consistent with

the

data, implies that

16

the variables DMUR and DMER can be replaced by DMUSt (DMlTS DMt XMES,
unexpected DMt formed from the survey) and XMESt (expected DMt from the
survey).

Before turning to the results which are based on these decompositions,
issues involved with determining the impact that monetary base announcements

may have on interest rates are considered. As described in section II, for
the majority of dates on which money supply announcements are made, monetary
base announcements are also made. These announcements are similar to the
money supply announcements in that they two contain two parts, an announced

change in the monetary base, DB -

Bt.i,

and an announced revision in the

monetary base, BRVt._ BLR.. B1. With no survey measures of expectations
concerning the monetary base announcements, DB and BRVt have been
decomposed using the same regression techniques used to decompose DMt and

NRVt. The variables formed are D&JRt (unexpected changes in the announced
monetary base formed from regression), DBERt (expected changes in the
announced monetary base formed from regression), BRVURt and BRVERt.

The regression equations used to form the decompositions of the money
supply and monetary base variables have been estimated separately for the
October 1979 to October 1982 and the post October 1982 periods. Given
limitations on data availability and the failure of the pre-October 1979
period to exhibit any significant relation between money supply
announcements and interest rates, that period is dropped from subsequent
analysis.

Table 2 presents the results of estimating equations for DMt and MRVt.

For purposes of comparison, results are also presented for XMt. The results

for the XN and DMt regressions are very similar, indicating that the survey
series can be viewed as an equally good measure of the expected change in

17

the announced money supply when that change does not include a revision as

when ft does. Although during the latter period lagged monetary base changes
do contain information which is useful for predicting announced money supply
changes that is not included in the survey forecast, the reported F-

statistics in the DM regressions show that the joint hypothesis that a1 — 1

and the remaining a 0 cannot be rejected at standard significance levels
in either time period. Survey responses thus appear to contain reasonably
accurate forecasts of money supply announcements.

The information examined here has significant explanatory power for
announcements of money supply revisions during the period from October 1979

to October 1982.16 The F-statistic in the MRV regression shows that the

hypothesis that a — 0 (i—1,7) is rejected at the 5% significance level.
This implies that it is feasible to measure the separate impacts of the
expected and unexpected money supply revisions on interest rates. In the
post-October 1982 sample money supply revisions appear to be essentially
unpredictable, raising the possibility that the impact of expected revisions
is not identifiable from the data.

The results presented in Table 3 indicate that, in both periods
examined, there is a predictable component to both the change in the
announced monetary base and the monetary base revision.

The standard errors of the regressions presented in Tables 2 and 3 are
also of interest. Those in Table 2 indicate that unexpected money supply
changes and revisions have become less volatile post-October 1982. Those in
Table 3 do not show a similar finding for unexpected monetary base changes

and revisions. Unexpected changes in the announced money supply are always
more variable than unexpected changes in the announced base. For both money
supply and monetary base announcements, unexpected revisions are less

18

variable than the unexpected changes but the difference is more pronunced
for the money supply.

Table 4 contains the results of relating interest rate changes to the
expected and unexpected components of the four series DM,

DB.. and

BRVt. Several of the results are worthy of note.17 First, during the October
1979 to October 1982 period, when announcement effects are most pronounced,
unexpected. increases in the announced monetary base significantly raise

interest rates.18 Regardless of how money supply announcements are

decomposed into an expected and an unexpected component, an unexpected
increase in the announced monetary base of one billion dollars is estimated
to increase the annualized interest rate on a three month U.S. Treasury bill

by over thirteen and one half basis points. This estimated impact is greater
in magnitude than the estimated impact of a. similarly sized unexpected

increase in the announced money supply, though the difference is not
19
statistically significant at the 5% level.

The strong impact that

unexpected monetary base announcements have on interest rates exists only in
the October 1979 to October 1982 period. There is no statistically
significant impact of monetary base announcements after October 1982.

The estimated response of interest rates to unexpected changes in the
announced money supply is not sensitive to allowing for effects of monetary
base announcements, relaxing the constraint on the effects of money supply
revisions, or augmenting survey data with additional information to form a
regression-based measure of expected money supply announcements. An
unexpected one billion dollar increase in the announced money supply is
estimated to raise interest rates by between nine and one half and ten basis

points in the October 1979 to October 1982 period and by between three and

19

one half and four basis points post-October 1982. These effects are always

statistically significant and are similar in magnitude to those in
Table 1.20
Interest rates do not move significantly in response to announcements
of unexpected money supply and monetary base revisions. However, the

hypothesis that unexpected changes and revisions affect interest rates with
equal magnitude and in opposite directions cannot be rejected at standard
significance levels either.21 Either omitting announcements of revisions

from the analysis or constraining their impact to be the same as that of
announcements of preliminary monetary figures is compatible with the data.

When announcements are decomposed into an expected and unexpected
component via regressions, no expected component of an announcement has a
significant impact on interest rates in any time period. In contrast, the
expected change in the announced money supply taken from the survey measure,
XMESt,

does have a significant impact on interest rates during the October

1979 to October 1982 period. Thus, the modelling of expectations is
important for determining if the expected component of announcements

significantly affect interest rates but is not important for determining the
significance of any other variables.22

VI. The Predictive Ability of Unexpected Announcements for Future Money
Supply and Monetary Base Changes

As shown in previous sections, interest rates move significantly in
response to unanticipated money supply and monetary base announcements. In
attempting to account for this effect of money supply announcements, one

20

popular hypothesis contends that an increase in the unexpected component of
the announced money supply raises expectations of money growth, thereby
raising expected inflation and nominal interest rates. A competing

hypothesis contends that an increase in the unexpected component of the
announced money supply lowers expectations of money growth, raises expected
future real interest rates, and thereby raises current real (and nominal)
interest rates. In what follows, these are referred to as the "money supply
expansion" and. "money supply contraction" hypotheses.23

Both these hypotheses envision unexpected announcements as conveying
information about the future course of the money supply. In this section,
the ability of unexpected money supply and monetary base announcements to
predict subsequent changes in the money supply, as well as in the monetary
base, is empirically examined.
It is shown that during the period from October 1979 to October 1982,

when monetary announcements had their largest impact on interest rates,
unexpected money supply announcements had different predictive implications
than did unexpected monetary base announcements. Unexpected increases in the

announced money supply signalled increased money growth, but unexpected
increases in the announced monetary base signalled decreased money growth.

Also, while unexpected increases in both the announced monetary base and
money supply are accompanied by higher base growth, this growth was larger
and more permanent following base announcements. Since unexpected changes in
the announced money supply and monetary base moved interest rates in the
same direction and by the same magnitude during this time period, these
findings cast doubt on the proposition that monetary announcements are
moving interest rates solely by providing information about the subsequent
behavior of the money supply or the monetary base. Changes in the predictive

21

ability of unexpected money supply and monetary base announcements in
October 1982 also appear problematical for this proposition.

Given the delay in publishing monetary data, a one billion dollar
unexpected increase in the money supply announced in week t raises the
expected change in the money supply from week t-2 to t-l by one billion
dollars plus any change in the expected money supply revision to be

announced in week t+l that can be predicted by this announcement.24 To the
extent that the monetary base announcement made in week t helps predict this

revision, it contains additional information regarding the money supply
change during this period. Both announcements may help predict money supply

changes from week t1 to any time in the future.
In order to examine these issues of prediction, the change in the money
supply over three different horizons and the relevant money supply revision
have been regressed on unexpected monetary announcements in week t. Table 5
reports the results from estimating these regressions. The dependent

variable MRV+i_ 2t÷l

is the money supply revision announced in week

t+l. DMFO.. t÷2

and DMFl3_ MLR±i5 Mt measure

the sum of this revision and the change in the money supply (including
revision) from week t-1 to week t, week t-l to one month after the
announcement and week t-l to one quarter after the announcement,
respectively. The independent variables are the unexpected announcements

DMUS and DBURt. Similar results apply if DMUS is replaced by XMUS, DMtJRt

or URt.
The evidence for the October 1979 to October 1982 sample is that a one

billion dollar surprise increase in the money supply announced in week t
predicts that the money supply change from week t-2 to week t will be higher

by 060 billion dollars (0.60 —

1.0

-

0.40),

a statistically significant

22

increase. This figure is the net result of the initial 1.0 billion dollar
increase from week t-2 to week t-l being revised to a 1.07 billion dollar
increase and followed by a reduction of 0.47 billion dollars in the money
supply from week t-l to t, a reduction which only partially offsets the
initial increase. The estimated a1 coefficients in the DMF4 and DMF13

regressions are not significantly different from zero but are significantly
different from minus one.25 Thus, for the one-month and one-quarter
horizons, one cannot reject the hypothesis that there is no offset of the
initial increase in the money supply but can reject the hypothesis that

there is a full offset of the initial increase. An unexpected increase in
the money supply announced in week t signals a permanently higher money
supply beginning with week t-1 and, accordingly, a higher growth rate from
week t-2 to all dates in the future.

In contrast, during the October 1979 to October 1982 period an
unexpected increase in the monetary base announced in week t predicts a
lower money supply in the future and lower growth rates from week t-2
forward. A 1.0 billion dollar surprise increase in the monetary base

predicts a significant reduction of 1.12 billion dollars in the money supply
change from week t-2 to t, with reductions of 1.41 and 2.06 billion dollars

predicted for thehorizons of one month and one quarter. Despite the
significance of these reductions for the longer horizons, the t-statistics
in square brackets beneath the coefficients indicate that no significant
changes are predicted from week t to the future. The significant money

supply contraction that follows an increase in the unexpected monetary base
announcement occurs only from week t-l to week t.

The results reported in Table 5 show that no major change is apparent
in the predictive ability of money supply announcements for money supply

23

behavior after October 1982. The parameter estimates suggest that, as
before, unexpected increases in the announced money supply signal higher
money growth rates from week t-2 to the future. Given the imprecision of the
estimated parameters, however, the evidence is less conclusive. Neither the
hypothesis that there is no offset following an unexpected increase in the
announced money supply nor the hypothesis that such an increase is fully
offset can be rejected at the 5% signficance level for horizons beyond the
announcement date.

For the post-October 1982 period, unexpected increases in monetary base
announcements predict a money supply reduction from week t-l to week t but
predict money supply expansion for the horizons of one month and one
quarter. These predicted expansions and the lack of any significant
predictive power are in sharp contrast to the results for the October 1979
to October 1982 period, when unexpected increases in the monetary base
significantly predict money supply reductions.

Taken together, the findings reported in Tables 4 and 5 lead to mixed
conclusions about the empirical accuracy of the the hypotheses discussed in
the first paragraph of this section. The "money supply contraction"

hypothesis is supported by the significant predictive ability of unexpected
monetary base announcements for money supply changes and the significant
effect of these announcements on interest rates during the October 1979 to
October 1982 period. The changes to a lack of significant predictive ability
and the absence of a significant interest rate effect for monetary base
announcements in the post-October 1982 period is also consistent with the
hypothesis. However, the finding that unexpected increases in the announced
money supply both raise interest rates and signal higher money growth in all
periods contradicts the hypothesis. While this latter result does provide

24

support for the "money supply expansion" hypothesis, the findings previously
discussed for monetary base announcements during the October 1979 to October
1982 period conflict with it. The "money supply expansion" hypothesis is
also in apparent conflict with the reduction in the impact of unexpected
money supply announcements on interest rates after October 1982 and the lack
of a noticeable change in the predictive ability of these announcements fur
subsequent money supply behavior.

The failure of these hypotheses to fully account for the interest rate
response to unexpected money supply and monetary base announcements
indicates that the response is not attributable to only the arrival of new
information about the behavior of the money supply. Unexpected monetary
announcements must be conveying information about other variables relevant
for interest rate determination. The monetary base may be such a variable.

Accordingly, Table 6 provides evidence on the predictive ability of
unexpected monetary announcements for future monetary base changes. This
evidence also supplements the evidence in Table 5 by indicating how the
money supply changes predicted by unexpected monetary announcements occur,
i.e. whether through changes in the monetary base and/or the money
multiplier.

A one billion dollar unexpected increase in the monetary base
announcement in week t raises the expected change in the base from week t-1
to t by one billion dollars plus any change it can predict for the revision
to be announced in week t÷l.26 Money supply announcements can help predict
changes in the monetary base from week t-l to week t only if they can
predict the base revision announced in week t+l. Both announcements may help
predict monetary base changes from week t to any time in the future.

monetary base behavior are for the period October 1979 to October 1982,

when an increase in the unexpected money supply announcement in week t
predicts an increase in the monetary base change from week t to t÷l.
However, there is no significant prediction of a change in the base for
horizons of one month or one quarter and the size of the estimated a1
coefficient in the DBF4 regression (and the t-statistic appearing in square
brackets below it) suggests that this initial increase in the base is offset
within a month.

As regards the predictive ability of unexpected monetary base
announcements, the evidence for the October 1979 to October 1982 sample is
that a 1.0 billion dollar surprise increase in the base announced in week t
predicts that the monetary base change from week t-l to t+l will be
statistically significantly higher by 0.31 billion dollars (0.31

0.69).

1.0 -

The predicted reduction of 0.69 billion dollars, which only partially

offsets the initial increase, is composed of a -0.20 billion dollar monetary
base revision announced at time t+l and a -0.49 billion dollar change in the
base from week t to t+1. The predicted monetary base changes from week t-1
to one month and one quarter after the announcement are also higher, by 0.32
and 0.20 billion dollars respectively. The similarity between the magnitude

26

of these changes and the change from week t-1 to t+1 suggests that no
important movements in the monetary base are predicted after week t+l. For
this sample, an unexpected increase in the monetary base announced in week t
signals a higher base during all weeks from t into the future and,

accordingly, a higher growth rate from week t-l to all dates in the future.
For the period post-October 1982, an unexpected increase in the base
announced in week t is again followed by significant offsetting changes. The
hypothesis that these changes fully offset the increase cannot be rejected
at any of the horizons considered using a 5% significance level. However,
for the one month and three month horizons the point estimates indicate only
a partial offset. In summary, an unexpected increase in the announced
monetary base provides evidence of a statistically insignificant increase in
base growth from week t-l to the future.
Taken together, does the evidence in Tables 4 and 6 suggest that the
informational content of unexpected monetary announcements for monetary base
changes is an important factor for explaining why these announcements affect
interest rates? For money supply announcements, the answer is quite clearly
no. These announcements generally have no predictive power for monetary base
changes, yet they do have a significant impact on interest rates. For
monetary base announcements the answer is less clear. During the October
1979 to October 1982 period, an unexpected increase in the announced
monetary base significantly raises interest rates and signals a permanently
higher level of the base, consistent with a "monetary base expansion"
hypothesis. After October 1982, the interest rate effect of unexpected
monetary base announcements diminishes and becomes insignificant while it is
unclear whether there is a reduction in the size of the monetary base change
predicted by these announcements.

27

Combining the results reported in Tables 5 and 6 provides evidence on
how the predictions of money supply changes contained in unexpected monetary
announcements are divided into predictions of subsequent changes in the
money multiplier and the monetary base. For both samples examined, an
unexpected increase in the money supply announcement made in week t predicts
a higher money supply for weeks t-l, t, t+4 and t+13, significantly so in

all but one case. Given that information about the monetary base in weeks
t-l and t is available in week t and that unexpected money supply
announcements have no significant predictive power for the monetary base
over the one month or one quarter horizons, the increase in the money supply
predicted for these weeks is due only to information about higher money
multipliers. Money supply announcements are not only providing new
information solely about previous money multipliers, but their predictions
of subsequent money supply changes are limited to predictions about
subsequent money multipliers.

Unexpected monetary base announcements have significant predictive
power for subsequent money supply behavior only from October 1979 to October
1982. During this period an unexpected monetary base increase announced in
week t signals a lower money supply and a higher monetary base for weeks t,
t+4 and t+13. Thus, the decrease in the money supply predicted by these
announcements is reflecting predictions of changes both in the multiplier
and in the base, with the multiplier changes being more important.

28

VII. The Impact of Monetary Announcements on Term-Structure Premia

This section provides evidence that several of the new empirical
regularities reported in previous sections for the interest rate on threemonth U.S. Treasury bills also carry over to the longer-term interest rates
on six- and twelve-month U.S. Treasury bills. Since these longer-term
interest rates can be decomposed into a current short-term rate, expected
future short-term rates and term premia, it is useful to determine the
specific channel that gives rise to the interest rate effects of
unanticipated monetary announcements. The results of this section indicate
that both unexpected money supply and monetary base announcements are
affecting six- and twelve-month interest rates through their impact on
current and expected future three-month rates, with no impact on term
premia.

The results presented in Tables 7 and 8, for six- and twelve-month
interest rates respectively, show many similarities to those presented in
Table 4 for the three-month interest rate. During the October 1979 to
October 1982 period, unexpected increases in both the announced money supply
and monetary base significantly raise these longer-term interest rates and
the hypothesis that the impact of an unexpected monetary base announcement
is equal to the impact of an unexpected money supply announcement of the

same magnitude cannot be rejected at standard significance levels.27 PostOctober 1982 only unexpected money supply announcements have a significant
effect. Expected announcements significantly affect six- and twelve-month
interest rates only if measured by the Money Market Services survey;

although in contrast to the results for three-month interest rates, these
effects are significant both before and after October 1982. Unexpected

29

monetary revisions do not have a significant impact on interest rates in
either sample.

Are the effects of unexpected monetary announcements on the longer-term
interest rates that are documented in Tables 7 and 8 capturing the effect of
these announcements on current short-term interest rates, on expected future
short-term interest rates and/or on term premia? Specifically, consider the
following equations which link the six-month interest rate to current and
expected future three-month interest rates and a term premium:

R6Bt =

.5*R3B + .5*btR3Bt+l3 + TP6Bt

R6A

.5*R3At + •5*a,tR3At+13 + TP6A

where R3B and R3A are the three-month interest rates before and after the
announcements in week t (similarly for R6Bt and R6A), b,tR3Bt+l3 is the
expectation of R3B÷13 before the announcement in week t, a,tR3At+13 is the

expectation of R3A+i3 after the announcement in week t, and TP6B and TP6A
are the term premia defined by the two equations. Subtracting the first
equation from the second yields

DR6 = DTP6 + .5*DR3t + •S*(a,tR3At+13 b,tR3Bt+l3)

where DTP6 TP6A - TP6B. The corresponding equation for the change in
the twelve-month interest rate is

DRl2= DTPl2-I .25*DR3t+ •25*(a,tR3At+i3 +• 25*(a, tR3A÷26

b,tR3Bt÷l3)

b, R3Bt÷26 + •25*(atR3At+39 b, R3B+39).

The arrival of new information contained in monetary announcements can

affect DR6 and DR12 through its effect on any or all of the variables on
the right-hand-side of the above equations.

A test of the hypothesis that unexpected monetary announcements move
these longer-term interest rates solely by affecting the current three-month
rate, i.e. that they have no impact on term premia or on expected future

30

three-month interest rates, can be conducted using results from regressions

of DR63. DR6 5*DR3 and DRl23 DRl2 . 25*DR3

on DMUSt and DBURt. A

finding of significant coefficients on these regressors indicates rejection
of the hypothesis. Table 9 reports the results of estimating these
regressions. During the period from October 1979 to October 1982, the

coefficients on DMUSt and DBURt in the DR6 .

coefficient on DMUS in the DRl2 .

5*DR3t regression and the

25*DR3t regression significantly differ

from zero at the 5% level. The coefficient on DMUSt is significant in both
regresssions after October 1982. Thus, the significant response of six- and

twelve month interest rates to unexpected monetary announcements is
reflecting a movement in expected future three-month rates and/or termstructure premia.
To examine whether movements in term-structure premia are significantly
responding to unexpected monetary announcements, the changes in the six- and

twelve month premia (DTP6 and DTP12) are postulated to be linear functions
of D1USt and DBURt. In addition, the terms a,tRSAt+j (j-=13,26 and 39) are

expressed as the sum of the actual value R3A

and a forecast error e.

J,t
Substituting these specifications into the above equations for DR6 and
t+.]

indicates that term-structure premia are affected by unexpected monetary
announcements. If the effect of these announcements on the longer-term
interest rates is solely due to their impact on current and expected future
three-month interest rates, then (except for sampling error) these
coefficients will not be significantly different from zero.

Table 10 provides estimates of the effects that unexpected monetary
announcements have on six- and twelve-month term-structure preniia.

Unexpected increases in the announced money supply are estimated to lower
both term premia in the October 1979 to October 1982 period but raise these

premia after October 1982. Unexpected increases in the announced monetary
base are estimated to increase both premia during the period from October
1979 to October 1982, the only period when these announcements have a
significant impact on interest rates. However, none of the coefficients
reported in Table 10 are significantly different from zero. Unexpected
monetary announcements appear to move six- and twelve interest rates because
of their impact on both current and three-month interest rates, but not
because of their impact on term-structure premia.

VIII. CONCLUDING REMARKS

This paper contains the results from an econometric investigation of
the link between interest rates, money supply announcements and monetary
base announcements. A new set of empirical regularities regarding the
effects of these announcements on interest rates, their predictive ability
for the subsequent behavior of the money supply and monetary base, and their

32

effects on term-structure premia has been presented. Since the main findings
have been summarized in the introductory section, we conclude by discussing
some of their implications for future research.

It has been shown that interest rates respond significantly not only to
announcements of the Ml money supply, but also to the announcements of the
monetary base. Since the Federal Reserve releases weekly information on a
variety of other monetary aggregates, a more complete characterization of
the monetary announcements-interest rate link can be obtained by
investigating the response of interest rates to these other announcements.
For example, the diminished magnitude of the impact that Ml announcements
have after October 1982 makes it interesting to know if announcements
concerning M2 or M3 are of increased importance for interest rate
determination after this date. In addition, it would be useful to examine
the effects of individual components of the announced monetary aggregates on
interest rates, e.g. checkable deposits, currency, borrowed reserves, and
nonborrowed reserves.

The methodology used in this paper to evaluate the ability of
alternative hypotheses to explain the link between monetary announcements
and interest rates is straightforward. It entails examining how the
information contained in the unexpected announcements can be used to predict
future values of critical variables. Since the evidence presented here casts
doubt on the proposition that unexpected monetary announcements are
affecting interest rates solely by providing information about the
subsequent behavior of the money supply or the monetary base, it would be
worthwhile to investigate whether these announcements contain information
concerning other variables relevant for interest rate determination.

33

Possible candidates are future inflation, real interest rates and real
economic activity.

In terms of future theoretical research, the empirical regularities
reported here place restrictions on the class of models that can be used to
explain the observed monetary announcements-interest rate link. The findings
that new information about both the money multiplier and the monetary base
have a significant impact on interest rates and that the magnitudes and
significance of these impacts are different when different operating
procedures are used by the Federal Reserve, are examples of phenomena that a
complete theoretical explanation must account for.

2. Admittedly, the correct procedure for this decomposition is not
immediately obvious given the vagueness of the survey question and the
fact that the money supply announcement contains two pieces of
information,

and MLRt. The survey asks for the respondent's expected

change in the money supply without specifying what base level should be

used. That is, no mention is made of whether the respondent should
forecast

M1 or Mt MLRt. If respondents are including a prediction

of the monetary revision in their forecast of the change in the money

supply, the correct decomposition is XMESt and (Mt MLRt) - XMESt. If
respondents are not forecasting the revision, the correct decomposition

is XMESt and (M M1) - XMES.

Both decompositions have been used in

the past, but the majority of researchers assume that respondents are

forecasting the revision. Accordingly, in this section the unexpected
change in the announced money supply is defined to be

MLR) - XMES.

An analysis of whether revisions in the

money supply are predictable and are included in respondents forecasts
is taken up section V.

3. Time periods A.l and B.l have been estimated separately since previous
research has shown that the October 1979 change in monetary policy, away
from interest rate targeting and towards monetary aggregates targeting,

has affected the money supply announcement-interest rate relation. We
subdivide the post-October 1979 period because of another change in
monetary policy in October 1982, when the Federal Reserve returned, at
least partially, to interest rate targeting.

4. Because some of the money supply announcements are on Thursdays and
others are on Fridays, DR3 measures an interest rate change which is
sometimes from Thursday to Friday and sometimes from Friday to Monday.

This, along with the fact that announcements do not always take place on

the scheduled day, led us to test for a day-of-the-week effect in our
sample. There was no evidence of such an effect.

5. These results are in conformity with those reported in studies using
similar specifications. For example Roley and Troll (1983) report the
impact of a one billion dollar surprise in the announced money supply on
the interest rate of a three-month U.S. Treasury bill to be 1.58 basis
points in the pre-October 1979 period and 10.38 basis points in the
October 1979 to October 1982 period. Shiller, Campbell and
Schoenholtz (1983) estimate the impact to be 9.88 in the period from
February 1980 to February 1983. Studies which measure the unexpected
money supply announcement in percentage rather than absolute changes are
also similar in that they indicate a positive, statistically significant
impact both pre-October 1979 and from October 1979 to October 1982, with
the magnitude of the impact being noticeably larger in the latter
period. See for example Cornell (1985), Falk and Orazem (1985),

and Judd (1984). Judd (1984) and Loeys (1985) present evidence that the

impact diminshes after October 1982. Work by Grossman (1981) and
Roley (1982,1983) on the pre-October 1979 and October 1979 to October
1982 periods differs from this study and the studies mentioned above
because they measure the change in interest rates over an hour and a
half interval rather than a one day interval. In terms of the sign and
significance of the estimated relations, their results match those of
Table 1.

6. These results are also in general agreement with those reported in other
studies. Direct comparison of point estimates is not possible since
studies which measure money supply announcements as absolute changes,

such as Roley and Troll (1983) and Shiller, Campbell and
Schoenholtz (1983), do not report an estimate of the impact of the

expected component of the announcement. However, studies which measure
money supply announcements in percentage terms, such as Cornell (1985)
and Falk and Orazem (1985), report the impact of the expected component
of the money supply announcement on the interest rate for a three-month
U.S. Treasury bill to be negative both pre-October 1979 and from
October 1979 to October 1982, but to be statistically insignificant in
the earlier period. For the latter period the results of Falk and

Orazem (1985) indicate that the impact is statistically significant
while those of Cornell (1985) indicate insignificance. Studies which
measure interest rate changes over an hour and a half horizon also
report results which are similar to those in Table 1. That is, Grossman
(1981) and Roley (1982,1983) find that pre-October 1979 expected money
supply announcements have a negative but insignificant impact on
interest rates, and Roley (1982,1983) finds that from February 1980 to
October 1982 this impact is negative and significant.

first and second halves of the sample. Chow tests of the stability of

computed. These tests lead to the same conclusions as those

reported in Table 1. In all tests, the coefficients that are not being
tested for stability are left unconstrained.

8. The Goldfeld-Quandt test for heteroskedasticity is described in
Johnston (1972), pages 218-19. The test involves ordering the
observations in a manner which, a priori, should lead to increasing
variance. Several observations are dropped from the middle of the
sample, a separate regression is fit to the first and last sets of

observations and the ratio of the two sums of squared residuals is
formed. Under the null hypothesis of no heteroskedasticity, the

asymptotic distribution of this statistic is the F-distribution with
n1- k and n2- k degrees of freedom, where n1 and n2 are the number of
observations in the first and last samples and k is the number of

explanatory variables. The test statistics reported in Table 1 use the
first and last 39 observations from sample A.l, the first and last 58
from sample B.l, the first and last 28 from sample C.l, the first and
last 38 from sample A.2, and the first and last 31 from sample A.3.

9. If XMLJS and XMES are orthogonal (uncorrelated), the OLS regression
coefficients on these variables can be obtained in the bivariate
regressions of DR3 on a constant and XMUS and DR3 on a constant and
XMES.

10. Testing for the stability of the coefficients a1 and a2 separately
confirms the fact that the Chow test reported in Table 1 is reflecting
primarily instability in a1. The F-test for testing stability of a1 is

7.35 (marginal significance level equal to .008) and for testing the
stability of a2 is 0.44 (marginal significance level equal to .51).
11. The date of March 30, 1978 results from dropping the first one fourth of
the pre-October 1979 sample. This date was arrived at as follows. The
two regressions estimated for the construction of the G-Q test reported
in Table 1 indicated that the variance of the regression error was
larger in the latter part of the pre-October 1979 sample. Splitting
these samples in half indicated no significant change in the size of the
error variance in the second half but a significant change of the error
variance in the first half. Next, we tested for a constant error
variance in the last three-fourths of the pre-October 1979 sample and
failed to reject this hypothesis.

12. For the pre-October 1979 period, Grossman (1981) estimates that a one
billion dollar positive surprise in the money supply announcement raises
the interest rate on a three-month U.S. Treasury bill by 0.83 points,
while Roley (1982,1983) reports estimates from 0.65 to 0.78 basis
points. In contrast to our finding in sample A.2, Grossman (1981) and
Roley (1982,1983) find this effect to be statistically significantly
different from zero. This difference is explainable by their use of a
shorter interval for measuring the interest rate change, which results
in more precise estimates. Roley (1983) also reports test statistics
indicating a lack of coefficient instability and of heteroskedasticity
in the pre-October 1979 sample.

13. So as not to constrain the variances of the regression errors to be
equal across samples, the tests have been conducted using weighted least
squares estimates. The weights are based on estimates of the regression
error variances obtained from the estimated equations reported in
Table 1.

14. Although it is generally recognized that October 1979 marks a change in
the money supply announcement-interest rate link, with the exception of
Roley (1983), previous work has not formally documented the significance
of this change. Loeys (1985) tests for the significance of changes in
the money supply announcement-interest rate relation but the results are
hard to interpret for two reasons. First, apparently no adjustment is
made for the heteroskedasticity across sample periods. Second, the
breakpoints used in the Chow tests are selected so as to maximize the

probability of finding a significant break. Quandt (1960) shows that
this procedure is not asymptotically valid.

15. As described in footnote 12, the relatively small impact of unexpected
announcements has been estimated to be statistically significant when
interest rate changes are measured over a shorter time interval than the
one day interval used here.

16. The issue of whether revisions of the originally published money supply
data are predictable or not has also been addressed by Mankiw, Runkle
and Shapiro (1984). Though their data and approach are different, they
reach the same basic conclusion -

- at

the time of its release, the

originally published estimate is not the optimal available predictor of
the true money supply.

17. Given that for the post-October 1982 period the F-test reported in
Table 2 does not reject the hypothesis that money supply revisions are
unpredictable, the equations of Table 4 have also been estimated for
this sample replacing MRVUR and NRVER. with MRV. None of the results

reported below are affected by this change.

18. The standard errors of the estimated parameters reported in Table 4, and
throughout the paper where appropriate, have been adjusted to reflect
the use of a two-step procedure, i.e. first using a regression to form

the expectations and then using these expectations as regressors. See
Murphy and Topel (1985) and Pagan (1984).
19. For example, the Wald statistic for testing that DBIJR and DMUR have the

same impact on interest rates is 0.55, which has a marginal significance
level of .46.

20. Data availability has necessitated reducing the sample sizes used for
Table 4 from those used for Table 1; for details, see the the appendix.
When the equations of Table 1 are estimated for the smaller samples, the
coefficients on XMUSt and XMESt are 9.24 and -6.76 for the period
October 1979 to October 1982 (SER

35.13, 2= .25, and

D.W. —

1.66),

(SER —

8.16, 2, .39, and D.W. — 1.93).

and 3.36 and -1.16 for the post-October 1982 period

21. For example, the Wald statistic for testing that the coefficient on DMUR
is equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the coefficient on NRVIJR

is .02 (marginal significance level of .89) in the earlier period and
.46 (marginal significance level of .50) in the latter period. In these

regressions the Wald statistic for testing that the coefficient on DBUR
is equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the coefficient on BRVUR
is 3.13 (marginal significance level of .08) in the earlier period and
1.99 (marginal significance level of .16) in the latter period.

22. This result conforms with Roley (1983) for the period February 1980 to
October 1982 (the only period he examines), despite some differences in
the construction of the augmented expectations.

23. These two hypotheses have also been referred to as the "expected
inflation" and the "policy anticipations" hypotheses. Because these
names are slightly misleading, in that both hypotheses implicitly
incorporate some policy anticipations, we use different names. For a
review of these, and other, hypotheses see Cornell(1983b).

24. DMUS should not alter expectations of money supply changes from week
t-j to t-2 (j3,4,...) because the new information it contains is
information about the money supply in week t-l. Expected money supply

changes from week t-2 to t+h (h-l,0,l,...) are the only ones that can
be affected.

25. Notice that the amount of serial correlation in the regression residuals
increases as the forecasts become for longer horizons. This is to be
expected since a longer horizon indicates overlapping forecasts, Depite
this serial correlation, the standard errors which are typically

reported for the estimated coefficients on the unexpected announcements
are valid, i.e. they are consistent estimates. This follows from the
fact that the unexpected announcements are serially uncorrelated.

26. DBUR should not alter expectations of monetary base changes from week
t-j to t-l (j=2,3,...) because the new information it contains is
information about the base in week t. Expected monetary base changes
from week t-1 to t+h (h=0,1,. ..)

are

the only ones that can be affected.

27. For the six-month interest rate, the Wald statistic for testing that
DEUR and DMUR have the same impact on interest rates is .40 (marginal
significance level of .53). For the twelve-month interest rate the Wald
statistic is .00.

28. Of primary concern here is a possible correlation between the regressors
and the regression error. If expectations are formed rationally, the

regressors DMUS and DBUR are errors from optimally formed forecasts
and are thus uncorrelated with b,tR3Bt÷j (j13,26,39), information

available at the time the forecasts are made. The remaining components

of the regression error terms are uncorrelated with the regressors DMUS
and DBURt under the assumption of rational expectations because they are
the forecast errors

(j—13,26,39), forecast errors based on an
ej

information set that includes the regressors. The ability to obtain
consistent estimates via ordinary least squares explains why the terms

b tR3B÷.3 (j—13,26,39) are not treated in the same way as a,
3
i.e. are not expressed as the sum of the actual value and a forecast
error. Recall that the expectations b tR3B+ are made before the
announcements in week t and thus the forecast error associated with them
will not in general be uncorrelated with DMUSt and DBT.JRt. Accordingly,

ordinary least squares estimation gives inconsistent estimates if the
regression error contains these forecast errors.

APPENDIX
Description of Sample Periods for the Regressions in Tables 1 - 10

The pre-October 1979 sample period A.l contains 106 observations,
covering September 29, 1977 to October 4, 1979. The pre-October 1979 sample
A.2 contains 104 observations, dropping the two influential observations
shown in Figure 1. Sample A.3 contains 78 observations, dropping the
influential observations and observations before March 30, 1978.
The October 1979 to October 1982 sample period B.l has 156
observations, covering October 11, 1979 to October 15, 1982. Two of the 158
possible observations are dropped because of changes in the definition of
money used in the announcement. The October 1979 to October 1982 sample B.2
has 134 observations. The loss of 22 additional observations is due to one
of the following reasons: (i) a change in the definition of money, (ii) the
money supply and monetary base announcements were not released on the same
day, (iii) an apparent typographical error in the published value of revised
monetary base, (iv) no monetary base announcement was made, (v) monetary
base announcements contain benchmark revisions, (vi) variables are
calculated using only data which was released after the October 1979 shift
in Federal Reserve policy. The sample periods B.3 and B.4 contain 114 and
103 observations. This reduction is necessary because these samples are used
when the change in the money supply and monetary base over horizons as long
as one quarter are required. More observations are dropped for the sample
B.4 than for B.3 since the change in the base cannot span the weeks in which
a benchmark revision is announced. Sample B.5 has 99 observations, with 35
observations dropped from sample Z.2 because this sample is used when the
three-month interest rate nine months hence is required.
The post-October 1982 sample period C.l contains 75 observations
covering October 22, 1982 to March 29, 1984. One of the 76 possible
observations has been dropped due to an apparent typographical error in the
announced money supply revision. Sample C.2 has 60 observations. The loss of
15 observations is due to one of the following reasons: (i) an apparent
typographical error in the published value of revised money supply, (ii) the
money supply and monetary base announcements were not released on the same
day, (iii) no monetary base announcement was made, (iv) monetary base
announcements contain benchmark revisions, (v) variables are calculated
using only data which was released after the October 1982 shift in Federal
Reserve policy. Samples C.3 and C.4 contain 51 and 33 observations, while
sample C.5 has 33 observations (though not the same 33 as sample C.4). The
reasons for dropping observations when going from sample C.2 to samples C.3,
C.4 and C.5 are the same as those for dropping observations when going from
sample B2 to samples B.3, 8.4 and B.5.

1. DR3t is the change in the annualized interest rate on a three-

month U.S. Treasury bill from the close of the market on the day of a money
supply announcement in week t to the close on the next trading day. XMESt is
the expected change in the money supply announced in week t, measured as

TABLE 1
(continued)

the median of the Money Market Services survey. XMtJS is the unexpected

change in the money supply announced in week t, measured as the preliminary
money supply announcement minus the contemporaneously-released announcement
of the revised money supply for the previous week minus XMESt. An
explanation of the observations used in the sample periods A.l, A.2, A.3,
B.l, and C.l appears in the appendix.
2. All equations are estimated by ordinary least squares. Numbers in
parentheses below the estimated coefficients are standard errors, A '*'

denotes that the estimated coefficient is significantly different from zero
at the 5% level of significance. NOB denotes the number of observations in
the data set, SER the standard error of the regression,

the coefficient

of determination adjusted for degrees of freedom and DW the Durbin-atson
statistic. The column entitled G-Q TEST contains the Coldfeid-Quandt test
statistic for testing that the error term is homoskedastic and, in
parentheses, its marginal significance level. The column entitled CHOW TEST
contains the standard Chow test statistic for testing that the coefficients
a1 and a2 are the same in the first half of the sample as they are in the
second half and, in parentheses, its marginal significance level. A '*'

in

either of the last two columns indicates that the null hypothesis being
tested can be rejected using a 5% significance level.
3. The test statistics at the bottom of the table test for stability

across the various samples by testing for equality of the coefficients
a1 and a2. The numbers in parentheses below the test statistics are marginal
significance levels. A '*' denotes that the null hypothesis of stability can

be rejected using a 5% significance level. The test statistics do not impose
the restriction that the variances of the regression error terms are equal
across samples.
