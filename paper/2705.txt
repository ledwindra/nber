TARIFFS IN AN ECONOMY WITH INCOMPLETE
MARKETS AND UNEMPLOYMENT

1.

Introduction
The

threat of unemployment is

one

of the most popular arguments in

favor of protectionism. Although international trade economists have
dedicated much attention to examining the consequences of
protectionist measures in various situations, they have done so far
less for economies in which unemployment exists. This relative absence
of analysis reflects, in large part, the difficulty inherent in the
introduction of unemployment into economic models in a manner both
tractable and consistent with microeconomic foundations. The
literature

that does analyze the interrelations between international

trade and unemployment, does so in economies in which the latter
results from the existence of rigid or slowly adjusting wages (e.g.

Johnson (1965), Lapan (1976), and Neary (1982)) or from the presence
of minimum wages

(Brecher (1974))l.

This paper seeks to analyze the implications of a tariff in an
economic environment in which the existence of incomplete markets
under uncertainty

leads agents to recur to the factor market, via

implicit contracts, as a way of providing partial insurance against
income instability. As demonstrated by the implicit contracts
literature, unemployment

is then a possibility in some states of

nature.

As a theory of unemployment implicit contract theory, of course,
has its shortcomings. As Akerlof and Miyazaki

(1980) ahow,

results only when the marginal revenue product of labor,

evaluated at full employment, is less than the reservation utility of
a worker. More sophisticated models, however, that allow for asymmetry
in information, risk aversion on the part of the firm, and require
contracts to be incentive compatible are able to generate unemployment
under conditions in which the above inequality is reversed (e.g.
Grossman and Hart (1983), Azariadis (1983)). Overall, the main
contribution of implicit contract theory —

the

perception of

employment and wage—setting as a long term relation that involves risk
sharing

—

seems a valuable

one whose consequences

deserve

to be

explored.

Although trade under uncertainty has itself been the subject of
several recent studies, these have primarily focused on the relevanre
of the basic theorems of international trade either in the absence of
any risk sharing mechanisms or under the assumption that solely
international risk sharing through international trade in equities is
of on
possible. Thus Newbery and Stiglitz (1984) demonstrate, by means
example, the possibility of Pareto inferior trade in an economy in

which risk sharing is inexistent and Helpman and Razin (1978)
establish the standard results of the Heckscher—Ohlin—Saiuuelson model
in a stock market model in which international trade in equities is
permitted.

With the notable exceptions of Ethier (1982, 1985) and Matusz
(1985, 1986), however, the possibility of agents providing insurance

by entering into implicit contracts has been ignored by trade

International trade is not in itself a cause of

unemployment but may, by changing relative prices, influence its size.
In contrast, the analysis undertaken here assumes that uncertainty

is

a product of fluctuations in the terms of trade and hence is aggregate
and a consequence of the openness of the economy. Furthermore, in
contrast with the standard partial equilibrium treatment of implicit
labor contracts,

the level of agents' expected utility and expected

profits is endogenously determined.2
Several questions are suggested by this approach. It is of
interest to examine how the implicit contract determines factor prices
and employment

as a function of the terms of trade. This leads to an

understanding of how income is divided among agents in "good" versus
"bad" times.

A

next step is to ask how a tariff, imposed after the

income and the level of employment within the economy. An important
question

is

whether tariffs may constitute a Pareto improvement over

free trade. That is, to the extent that import relief legislation
manifests a social desire to provide insurance, is a tariff an
efficient instrument for doing
Independently of any threat of unemployment, an important argument
for protection is that commercial policy is able to play a role in

providing in trance when domestic markets are incomplete. (This
argument is especially important in the context of developing
economies where market incompleteness is thought to be more
prevalent.)

Eaton and Grossman (1985) show, for example, that in a

sector—specific economy with no risk sharing mechanisms

a marginal

tariff at free trade may increase social welfare. The question then
arises, however, whether a tariff may constitute a Pareto improvement
over free trade in an environment in which some form of domestic
insurance —

in

this case implicit contracts —

exists.

2. The Model

Consider a small open economy that produces two goods (X1 and X2)

with one factor of production, labor (L). Technology in each sector,
and 0, is assumed to be quasi—concave, twice differentiable,

F

with

F(O)—C(O)—O and F'(O)—G'(O)—.. To simplify notation assume that there
is only one firm in each sector. The economy is populated by two typee

3For example, article XIX of the GATT and section 201 of the U.S.
Trade Act of 1974 allow tariff concessions (reductions) to be
withdrawn if a product is imported in such quantities so as to cause
serious injury to domestic producers.

of agents characterized by their objectives, endowments, and attitudes
towards risk: entrepreneurs own firms and maximize expected profits
and 1 risk—averse workers own their labor and maximize expected
firm
utility.4 Reflecting the assumption that firms make some sort of
specific investment

in their workers, labor is assumed to be ex ante

mobile and ex post immobile, i.e. once employed in a firm labor is,
for at least the short to medium—run time interval considered here,
firm specific. Workers possess identical utility functions and
identical i'divisible endowments of labor.
As a result of, for example, an uncertain degree of import
competition for good X1, the economy faces uncertainty

in the terms of

trade. So that, letting X2 be the numeraire of the economy and P be
the relative price of X1 in terms of X2, P is a random variable

PP.

that

As has been shown by the implicit contracts

literature, given the above risk preference assumptions it is mutually
advantageous under uncertainty for entrepreneurs and workers to
formulate

a

'contract" specifying the employment level of and the

income to be paid to workers in each state of nature (where each
realization of P, p, is associated with a different state of nature).D
This enables workers to trade—off some of the income instability which
they are subject to as a consequence of a fluctuating marginal revenue
product in a full employment, perfectly competitive environment and
'. Entrepreneurs are assumed to be endowed with a sufficient
state of
quantity of good X2 so as to prevent bankruptcy in any
nature.
The clasic references are Azariadis (1975), Baily (1974), and

Gordon (1974). The implicit contracts literature has been reviewed
recently by Rosen (1985) and Hart and Holmstrom (1986).

permits the risk—neutral entrepreneur to lower the expected wage bill.
Hence, assuniing that entrepreneurs and workers know the probabillty
distribution h(p) of P, both parties will enter into an implicit
contract.
Prior to the realization of the state of nature the firm decides
the quantity of workers, N, with which it wishes to contract given the

market level of expected utility, U, that each contracted worker must
receive. Those workers are then offered a contract of the form

Workers either work,

their total endowment of labor, and enjoy indirect

utility V(w,p), or are unemployed with utility

.

The latter can be

interpreted as the utility derived from the leisure available when
unemployed or from a state—invariant non—tradable consumption basket
of goods obtained by home production during unemployment. I assume, as
in Azariadis

(1975), that firms cannot offer workers unemployment

insurance.6 Furthermore, contracts are assumed to be incentive
compatible so that entrepreneurs are restricted to wages such that

Consider the maximization problem faced by the firm in the sector

The first constraint ensures that workers receive expected utility

the probability of employment, and the utility derived when
unemployed, weighted by the probability of unemployment. The second

it contrac'ed.

The first foc determines optimal risk sharing between workers and
entrepreneurs and requires the marginal utility of the wage to be
constant over all states of nature. The second requires the cost of a
marginal reduction in the probability of employment,
to exceed or equal the benefit, wN. The first term,

pFLN-t-A(V—U),

PFLN, measures the

value of the loss in output resulting from a marginal decrease in e.
The term A(V—U) is the amoumt by which the wage bill would have to be
increased in order to restore workers to the same level of utility as
prior to the decrease in the probability of employment, i.e.

lowering e by C1 since the increased price of good X1 implies that
employment in that state of nature is less attractive and hence that
the firm's wage compensation to workers for a lower employment

is greater than the increase in marginal cost,

the firm should

decrease the quantity of labor hired, thus obtaining the "counter—

trade, a decreasing function of p.
In the export sector, differentiation of (2—u) yields:

The behavior of employment in both sectors as a function of the
terms of trade is shown in Figure 2.
The effect of a marginal price increase on profits in sector one
depends on the status of employment in that sector. Differentiating
the profit function with respect to p and using (7) obtains:

(14)

so that under full employment workers' conditional

This

is a consequence of the

With unemployment the sign of (14) is

on whether the net negative effect of a

that, if compensation is allowed, agents in sector two would prefer

a lower to a higher price for X1.
The results derived in this section differ from those of Jones
(1971) sector—specific model or the Heckscher—Ohlin—Samuelson

model.

Under full employment in both sectors the economy behaves more along
the lines predicted by the Stolper—Samuelson theorem.

A

price increase

pits all workers against sector one entrepreneurs; the position of
sector two entrepreneurs

is ambiguous. When there is unemployment in

least one sector of the economy, however, various combinations of
agents gaining and losing are possible including outcomes with the
flavor of the sector—specific model in which all agents in sector one
favor the price increase and those in sector two are opposed.

4. Welfare Analysis of a Tariff
This section analyzes the question of whether a tariff can
constitute a Pareto improvement over free trade. The tariff examined
is imposed by the government after the state of nature is known but
before firms have made their decision as to the particular identity of
the workers to be hired or laid off. This reflects the assumption that
the government is unable to make state contingent transfers, otherwise
the economy could simply proceed to the first best by allowing the
government to play any viable insurance role.
The tariff is unanticipated. This case is of interest because the
government cannot make state contingent plans and, moreover, ex ante
policies would tend to be time inconsistent. Thus the scenario is one
in which the government knows the unemployment that will result (if

16
any) under the particular state of nature that has been realized, and

may choose to impose a tariff.
The imposition of a tariff implies that firms and workers alter
the original wage—employment decision to that determined by the
contract for the state of nature corresponding to the tariff inclusive
price. That is, it is as if the contract had been written with the
states of nature given by the domestic price level p_p*(l+t), where p'
denotes the free trade relative price of good X1, so that a tariff, as
far as the contract is concerned, merely moves the economy to a stats
of nature corresponding to higher realizations of p*
The possibility of a tariff improving welfare appears more likeiy

when the economy has unemployment in sector one and full employment in
sector two since in this situation

a

small tariff unambiguously

increases employment and the value of output at free trade prices.
To analyze whether in this situation a tariff is capable of
permitting a Pareto improvement over free trade, we examine the set sf
constrained Pareto optima described by the solutions to

Max £=V(w1+s1/L1, p*(l+tflL1 + (N1—L1) +

is a lump sum transfer of income to employed workers in

sector i, i=l,2 or to entrepreneurs in sector two, i—3, and T is the

tariff revenue.
Note that the formulation of (23) assumes that the government is
able to engage in lump—sum transfers of income among employed workers

17
and entrepreneurs but not to unemployed workers. This respects the
initial restriction faced by entrepreneurs prohibiting them from
providing unemployed workers with insurance. Insofar as the government
is forced to respect the same restrictions as entrepreneurs, this
avoids one of critiques of this literature in that the government's
conduct of trade policy is not ad hoc assumed to be free of the
constraints

faced by the private market.1°

The preceding analysis permits us to conclude that free trade is a
constrained

Pareto optimum and hence that a small tariff at free trade

cannot be Pareto improving. The intuition behind this result is as
follows: In many models of incomplete markets (e.g.

Stiglitz

(l982a,.4) the constrained suboptimality of the competitive
equilibrium follows from the fact that competitive agents do not take
into account the effect of their actions on the distribution of prices
in the economy. In these environments prices play a dual role: they
simultaneously allocate goods and distribute risk among agents. Since
the public good nature of prices is not taken into consideration by
agents, the competitive market generally will not induce the optimal
distribution of risk and a set of taxes may be Pareto improving.
This role for taxes is not available in the present context.
Contracts have already been written in such a way as to provide the
risk—averse agents with the optimal amount of insurance, i.e. the

19
marginal utility of the wage is constant over states of nature, and
the underlying distribution of prices is exogenous and hence cannot h

changed by government policy. Thus the effect of the tariff is simply
to move agents along the preestablished contract and to make availabl
the associated tariff revenue.
Yet another insightinto why a tariff is not Pareto improving may

be derived from

the theory of the second—best. The implicit contract,

as its construction indicates, is optimal given the restrictions
imposed, i.e.

,

g

ien

the inability of entrepreneurs to insure

unemployed workers. The production inefficiency inherent in the
contract is an outcome of this restriction. The imposition of a
tariff, however, does not create an additional market by which to
bypass this restriction and it introduces an additional consumption
inefficiency. Consequently, it is not to be expected that a tariff ma
be Pareto improving in this economy.

5. Concluding

Remarks

This paper examines the effect of a tariff in an economy with
implicit contracts. The optimal contract is characterized and wages

and employment are shown to differ in important ways from that
predicted by standard models. Furthermore, it is shown that a tariff
cannot constitute a Pareto improvement over free trade.
Several directions for further research are suggested by this
approach. Most important is the role of an anticipated tariff or stat
contingent trade policy on the part of the government, assuming that
pre—commitment

is feasible. This would, of course, affect the form of

the contract itself. Another area to explore involves more

20
sophisticated contract models in which the reasons for the second best
nature of the contract is more firmly grounded in microeconomic
theory, e.g. moral hazard stemming from asymmetric information.
