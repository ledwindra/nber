Strategic Asset Allocation in a Continuous-Time VAR Model

JEL No. G12
ABSTRACT
This note derives an approximate solution to a continuous-time intertemporal portfolio and
consumption choice problem. The problem is the continuous-time equivalent of the discrete-time
problem studied by Campbell and Viceira (1999), in which the expected excess return on a risky
asset follows an AR(1)process, while the riskless interest rate is constant. The note also shows how
to obtain continuous-time parameters that are consistent with discrete-time econometric estimates.
The continuous-time solution is numerically close to that of Campbell and Viceira and has the
property that conservative long-term investors have a large positive intertemporal hedging demand
for stocks.

Introduction

Campbell and Viceira (1999) study the impact of predictable variation in stock returns
on intertemporal optimal portfolio choice and consumption. They consider an infinitely
lived investor who faces a constant riskless interest rate and a time-varying equity premium.
They model this time-variation using a discrete-time, homoskedastic VAR (1) process for log
excess stock returns and a state variable driving changes in expected returns. This model
of investment opportunities implies that the Sharpe ratio is linear in the state variable.
Campbell and Viceira assume that the investor has recursive Epstein-Zin utility (Epstein
and Zin 1989, 1991), a generalization of power utility that allows both the coeﬃcient of
relative risk aversion and the elasticity of intertemporal substitution in consumption to be
constant free parameters. They derive an approximate analytical solution for the optimal
portfolio rule, and show that this rule is linear in the state variable. When they calibrate
this model to U.S. stock market data for the postwar period, they find that intertemporal
hedging motives greatly increase the average demand for stocks by investors whose relative
risk aversion coeﬃcients exceed one.
Because Campbell and Viceira work in discrete time, no exact portfolio solutions are
available in their model except in the trivial case of unit risk aversion, which implies myopic
portfolio choice. Campbell and Viceira claim, however, that their solution becomes exact
in the limit of continuous time when the elasticity of intertemporal substitution equals
one.

They base this claim on the fact that they use an approximation to the investor’s

intertemporal budget constraint which becomes exact as the time interval of their model
shrinks.
This paper presents a continuous-time analysis of Campbell and Viceira’s portfolio choice
problem. The paper finds a continuous-time representation of the VAR(1) process in their
paper, and solves a continuous-time version of their model. The solution is exact when
1

the elasticity of intertemporal substitution equals one, and approximate otherwise.

The

continuous-time solution has the same qualitative properties as the discrete-time solution in
Campbell and Viceira, and is quantitatively similar. However the continuous-time solution
is likely to be more appealing and intuitive to finance theorists who are accustomed to
working in continuous time.

2.1

A continuous-time VAR

We start by assuming that there are two assets available to the investor, a riskless asset with
instantaneous return
dBt
= rdt,

(1)

and a risky asset (“stocks”) whose instantaneous return and expected return follow a continuoustime bivariate process:

where dZS,t and dZµ,t are independent Wiener processes.

Equation (2) implies that the instantaneous return on stocks (dSt /St ) follows a Geometric
Brownian Motion, whose drift (or instantaneous expected return) µt follows a mean-reverting
process. Section 2.3 below shows that this is the continuous-time counterpart of the discretetime VAR(1) process in Campbell and Viceira (1999).

Time-aggregation of the continuous-time VAR

Bergstrom (1984) and Campbell and Kyle (1993) show how to derive the discrete-time
process implied by a continuous-time VAR when we take point observations of the continuous
time process at evenly spaced points {t0 , t1 ..., tn , tn+1 , ....}, with ∆t = tn − tn−1 . Direct
application of their results shows that the process y in (3) has the following discrete-time
VAR(1) representation:
ytpn +∆t = exp {∆tA} ytpn + uptn +1 ,
where
uptn +1

Therefore, given values for the parameters of the continuous-time process (2), we can
easily aggregate to any frequency ∆t, by using (8) and (10). The discrete-time representation is especially useful in recovering the parameters of the continuous-time VAR (2) from
estimates of the equivalent discrete-time VAR (8). We do this in the next section.

2.3

Recovering continuous-time parameters from a discrete-time
VAR

In their analysis of optimal consumption and portfolio choice with time-varying expected
returns, Campbell and Viceira (1999, 2000) assume that the log excess returns on stocks is
4

described by the following discrete-time VAR(1):
 

where rf is the return (assumed constant) on a T-bill with maturity ∆t.

We now show that the discrete-time VAR given in (11) and the continuous-time VAR
given in (2) are equivalent representations of the same process. To see this, note that we
can rewrite the discrete-time aggregation of y in (8) as follows:

A simple comparison of the coeﬃcients in (11) and (13) gives us a system of equations
that relate the discrete-time parameters of the VAR process in Campbell and Viceira (1999)
to the continuous-time parameters of our continuous time VAR process. For the intercept

Campbell-Viceira (2000) report estimates of the VAR (11) based on US quarterly data
for the period 1947.Q1-1995.Q4. Table I shows the value of the parameters of the continuoustime equivalent VAR implied by their estimates.2
2

There is an estimation error in Campbell and Viceira (1999) that results in an underestimation of the

degree of predictability in stock returns in their paper. Campbell and Viceira (2000) report correct estimates,
and calibration results based on the corrected estimates.

2.4

A common mistake

Anyone used to working with the discrete-time representation of a univariate continuoustime process will find natural and intuitive the relation between the intercept and slope of the
continuous-time VAR and its discrete-time representation implied by equations (14)-(16).
However, equations (17)-(19) show that the equivalence relation for the variance-covariance
matrix of innovations is less obvious. Using an intuitive extension of the usual matching
rules for simple, univariate process, one might be tempted to write:
Vartn (εn+1 ) ≈ σ 2S ∆t
¡
¢
Covtn εtn +∆t , η tn +∆t ≈ ρσ S σ µ ∆t
¡
¢
Vartn η tn +∆t ≈ σ 2µ ∆t.

(20)

It should be apparent from equations (17)-(19) that this matching is incorrect–though
equation (20) is a first-order Taylor expansion of the correct expression for Vartn (εn+1 ) given
in (19). The use of (20) is particularly dangerous when ∆t 6= 1, as might be the case when
one is using annualized parameters and quarterly data. In this case portfolio solutions based
on (20) can be quite diﬀerent from the correct solutions that we will derive using equations
(17)-(19).

Intertemporal Portfolio Choice

We have shown in Section 2, that the investment opportunity set described by equations
(1) and (2) is equivalent to the investment opportunity set that Campbell and Viceira
(1999) assume in their discrete-time, intertemporal optimal consumption and portfolio choice
model. In this section we solve their model in continuous time, using the techniques described
in Chacko and Viceira (2000) and Campbell and Viceira (2002), and we show that the
7

solution is invariant to the choice of discrete-time or continuous-time approximations to
solve for the model.

3.1

Assumptions on investment opportunities and preferences

We consider an investor who has only two assets available for investment, a riskless bond
and stocks, and no labor income. Return dynamics are given by (1) and the bivariate system
(2). For convenience, we rewrite the system (2) as
dSt
= µt dt + σ S dZeS ,
St

where

dµt = κ (θ − µt ) dt + σ µ dZeµ ,
p
where dZeS = dZS , and dZeµ = ρdZS + 1 − ρ2 dZµ . Note that the instantaneous correlation
between dSt /St and dµt is ρ.

These assumptions on investment opportunities imply that the wealth dynamics for the
investor are given by
dWt = rWt dt + αt Wt [(µt − r) dt + σ S dZS ] − Ct dt,

(21)

where αt is the fraction of wealth invested in stocks.
Campbell and Viceira (1999) assume that the investor has recursive Epstein-Zin preferences over consumption. Duﬃe and Epstein (1992a, b) provide an equivalent continuous-time
parameterization of recursive preferences:
Z ∞
f (Cs , Js ) ds,
Jt =
t

where f (Cs , Js ) is a normalized aggregator of current consumption and continuation utility

that takes the form
f (C, J) =

1
ψ

Ã
(1 − γ) J 

C
((1 − γ) J)



− 1 .

(22)

Here β > 0 is the rate of time preference, γ > 0 is the coeﬃcient of relative risk aversion,
and ψ > 0 is the elasticity of intertemporal substitution.
There are two interesting special cases of the normalized aggregator (22): ψ = 1/γ and
ψ = 1. The case ψ = 1/γ is interesting because in that case the normalized aggregator (22)
reduces to the standard, additive power utility function–from which log utility obtains by
setting γ = 1. In the second special case, the aggregator f (Cs , Js ) takes the following form
as ψ → 1:

·
f (Cs , Js ) = β (1 − γ) J log (C) −

¸
1
log ((1 − γ) J) .
1−γ

(23)

The case ψ = 1 is important because it allows an exact solution to our dynamic optimization
problem for investors who are more risk averse than an investor with unit coeﬃcient of
relative risk aversion. We now explore this solution, as well as an approximate solution for
investors with ψ 6= 1 in the next section.

3.2

Bellman equation

Duﬃe and Epstein (1992a, b) show that the standard Bellman principle of optimality applies
to recursive utility. The Bellman equation for this problem is
0 =

where f (Ct , Jt ) is given in (22) when ψ 6= 1, or (23) when ψ = 1. Jx denotes the partial
derivative of J with respect to x, except Jt , which denotes the value of J at time t.

Of course, the form of this equation depends on whether we consider the case ψ 6= 1 and use
the normalized aggregator in (22), or we consider the case ψ = 1 and use the normalized
aggregator (23).Appendix B shows the partial diﬀerential equation that obtains in each case.
Campbell and Viceira (1999) claim that their discrete-time solution is exact for the case
ψ = 1 up to a discrete-time approximation to the log return on wealth, and note that this
approximation becomes exact in continuous-time. The continuous-time model in this paper
confirms their claim. We show in Appendix B that (27) has an exact analytical solution in
the case ψ = 1. This solution is

where A, B, and C are functions of the primitive parameters of the model describing investment opportunities and preferences.
In the more general case ψ 6= 1, there is no exact analytical solution to (27). However,
we can still find an approximate analytical solution following the methods described in
Campbell and Viceira (2002) and Chacko and Viceira (1999). We start by guessing that the
value function in this case also has the form given in (28), with
1−γ

I (µt ) = H (µt )−( 1−ψ ) .

(30)

Substitution of (30) into the Bellman equation (27) results in an ordinary diﬀerential equation for H(µt ). This equation does not have an exact analytical solution in general. However,
we show in Appendix B that taking a loglinear approximation to one of the terms in the
equation results in a new equation for H(µt ) that admits an analytical solution. The form
of this solution is an exponential-quadratic function similar to (29):
½

C1 2
H (µt ) = exp A1 + B1 µt +

(31)

The term that we need to approximate in the ordinary diﬀerential equation for H(µt ) is
β ψ H(µt )−1 . Simple substitution of (28) and (31) into the first order condition (25) shows that
this term is simply the optimal consumption-wealth ratio Ct /Wt . Thus this loglinearization
is equivalent to loglinearizing the optimal consumption-wealth ratio around one particular
point of the state space. Campbell and Viceira (2002) and Chacko and Viceira (1999)
suggest approximating this term around the unconditional mean of the log consumption
wealth-ratio.This choice has the advantage that the solution will be accurate if the log
consumption-wealth is not too variable around its mean. Appendix B provides full details
of this solution procedure.

3.3

Optimal portfolio choice

The optimal portfolio policy of the investor obtains from substitution of the the solution
for the value function into the first order condition (26). In the case ψ = 1, substitution of
(28)-(29) into the first order condition (26) gives

where B1 = −B1 /(1 − ψ) and C1 = −C1 /(1 − ψ). Appendix B shows that B1 and C1 do not
depend on ψ, except through a loglinearization parameter.
Equations (32) and (33) show that the optimal allocation to stocks is a weighted average
(with weights 1/γ and 1 − 1/γ) of two terms, both of them linear in the expected return
on stocks µt . The first term is the myopic portfolio allocation to stocks, and the second
term is the intertemporal hedging demand for stocks. The myopic portfolio allocation is
proportional to (1/γ), so that it approaches zero as we consider increasingly risk averse
investors. The intertemporal hedging component is proportional to (1 − 1/γ), so that one
might be tempted to conclude that it does not approach zero in the limit as γ → 0. However,
we need to consider that B0 (or B1 ) and C0 (or C1 ) are also functions of γ. We can show that
the limit of the overall expression approaches zero as γ → 0.

3.4

Numerical calibration

Section 3.3 derives the optimal portfolio rule for the continuous-time version of the discretetime model in Campbell and Viceira (1999). This portfolio rule is similar to the discrete
time portfolio rule in their model3 . We can use the parameter values given in Table I to
calibrate the continuous-time portfolio rule (33), and compare the resulting mean allocations
to those reported in Table III of Campbell and Viceira (2000).4 Note that the linearity of
the optimal portfolio rule (32)-(33) implies that

where the first element of the sum is the mean myopic portfolio allocation, and the second

Table II has a structure identical to Table III in Campbell and Viceira (2000) to facilitate
comparison. Panel A in Table II shows mean optimal portfolio allocations implied by the
parameter values given in Table I. These allocations are similar, but not identical, to those
given in panel A of Table III in Campbell and Viceira (2000). This is a direct result of the
nonlinearity in the time-aggregation of the variances and covariances of innovations (σ S , σ µ ,
ρ), and the persistence parameter κ.
Panel B in Table II shows the percentage that the mean intertemporal hedging portfolio

to those reported in Table III of Campbell and Viceira (2000), and support one of the main
3

To see this, compare equation (33) with the expressions in Proposition 1 of Campbell and Viceira (1999).

Appendix B shows that B1 and C1 depend on the loglinearization parameter h1 = E[ct − wt ], which

is endogenous. However, one can solve for h1 using the simple numerical recursive algorithm described in
Campbell and Viceira (1999).

13

conclusions in Campbell and Viceira (1999): That given the historical experience in the US
stock market, intertemporal hedging motives greatly increase the average demand for stocks
by investors who are more risk averse than a logarithmic investor. For highly conservative
investors, hedging may represent 90% or even more of the total mean demand for stocks.

Conclusion

This paper presents a continuous-time version of the model of optimal intertemporal portfolio choice and consumption with time-varying equity premium of Campbell and Viceira
(1999). It shows that this model has an exact analytical solution when the investor has
unit elasticity of intertemporal substitution in consumption and an approximate analytical
solution otherwise. For calibration purposes, we also derive the discrete-time representation
of the continuous-time VAR describing the asset return dynamics. This aggregation result
is useful to recover the parameters of the model from discrete-time estimates. Our equivalence result shows that intuitive discrete-time representations of univariate continuous-time
processes do not translate immediately to multivariate processes which are cross-sectionally
correlated.
Our calibration results show that our portfolio choice model exhibits the same properties
as its discrete-time counterpart. In particular, given the historical experience in the US
stock market, intertemporal hedging motives greatly increase the average demand for stocks
by investors who are more risk averse than a logarithmic investor. For highly conservative
investors, hedging may represent 90% or even more of the total mean demand for stocks.

We can solve this system by solving equation (38) and then using the result to solve (39)
and finally solve (40). Equation (38) is a quadratic equation whose only unknown is C0 .
Thus it has two roots. Campbell and Viceira (1999) show that only one of them maximizes
expected utility. This root is the one associated with the negative root of the discriminant
of the equation. This is also the only root that ensures that C0 = 0 when γ = 1, that is, in
the log utility case. This is a necessary condition for intertemporal hedging demand to be
zero, as we know it must in the log utility case.
We can use these results to obtain the optimal portfolio policy of the investor from the
first order condition (26), and the optimal consumption policy from the first order condition
(25). The optimal portfolio policy is given in equatio (32) in text. It is easy to see that the
optimal consumption policy is Ct /Wt = β, a constant consumption-wealth ratio equal to the
rate of time preference.

Approximate analytical solution when ψ 6= 1

Substitution of (28) and (30) into the Bellman equation (27) gives, after some simplification,
the following ordinary diﬀerential equation:

This ordinary diﬀerential equation does not have an exact analytical solution, unless ψ = 1.
Though there does not exist an exact analytical solution to (41), we can still find an
approximate analytical solution following the methods described in Campbell and Viceira
(2002).and Chacko and Viceira (1999). First, we note that substitution of the solution guess
(28)-(30) into the first order condition (25) gives
Ct
= β ψ H (µt )−1 .
Wt
We can now use the following approximation for β ψ H −1 around the unconditional mean of
the log consumption-wealth ratio:
β ψ H (µt )−1 = exp {ct − wt }
≈ h0 + h1 (ct − wt )
= h0 + h1 (ψ log β − ht ) ,

(42)

where ct = log Ct , wt = log Wt , ht = log H (µt ), and
h1 = exp {E [ct − wt ]} ,

(43)

h0 = h1 (1 − log h1 ) .

(44)

We can solve this system by solving equation (45) and then using the result to solve (46)
and finally solve (47). Equation (45) is a quadratic equation whose only unknown is C.
Thus it has two roots. Campbell and Viceira (1999) show that only one of them maximizes
expected utility. This root is the one associated with the positive root of the discriminant of

20

the equation. Note also that this equation implies that C/(1 − ψ) does not depend on ψ–
except through the loglinearization parameter h1 –which in turn implies, through equation
(46), that B/(1 − ψ) does not depend on ψ either.
