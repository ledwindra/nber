August, 1980

Does the Investment Interest Limitation Explain
the Existence of Dividends?

AB S TRACT

Miller and Scholes show that under certain conditions the Federal
Income tax taxes dividend income at a rate no higher than the rate on

capital gains. Tabulations of actual 1977 tax returns show that the
special circumstances under which this can occur apply to less than
3% of dividend income and no significant role can be ascribed to their
result in the determination of corporate dividend policy.

Does the Investment Interest Limitation
Explain the Existence of Dividends?
Daniel Feenberg

"[the deduction of interesti permits the taxpayer to make loans for the
purchase of wholly exempt securities and then deduct the interest paid on
such loans from his otherwise taxable income, thereby reducing the tax."
—— A Senate report of 19181

Miller and Scholes (1918) propose the following strong dividend invariance

proposition: "Given the firm's investment decision, the firm's dividend
decision will have no effect on the wealth or economic welfare of its

[rationall shareholders." This stands in sharp contrast to the conventional
view that taxable shareholders will prefer capital gains to dividends both
because capital gains are taxed at a lower rate and because taxation of such

gains is deferred until realization. This note begins with a short restatement
of the conditions necessary for dividend invariance to hold, and concludes with
a

measurement made from a large sample of the U.S. tax returns of the extent to

which these conditions

hold. It is shown that the special circumstances under

which Miller and Scholes' hypothesis can occur are so rare that no role may logically be ascribed to the hypothesis in the determination of corporate dividend
policy.

Conventional finanical wisdom suggests that individual shareholders
could have saved half or more of the over eight billion dollars in taxes paid
on twenty—six billion dollars in dividend income reported on their 1911 indivi-

dual income tax returns. This would require only that firms make more extensive
use of well known

techniques

for converting dividends to capital gains.

Miller and Scholes present a clever explanation for this seemingly irra—

tional behavior of firms. They suggest that earlier authors have not read the

—2—
tax code carefully, and that the rational, wealth—maximizing taxpayer—
shareholder will actually pay a lower rate of tax on dividends than on capital

gains. This surprising outcome is the result of the interaction of a time
honored tax dodge ——

borrowing

to finance tax favored investment ——and a little

known section of the current tax law which regulates that practice. In essence,
Miller and Scholes propose that for each dollar of dividend income that shareholders receive they should borrow a sufficient sum of money to produce a one

dollar interest expense deduction. If the loan proceeds are invested in a
single payment annuity or some other tax favored security a net reduction in

taxable income is achieved.2 Furthermore, if the altered cash flow presents a
problem for the taxpayer, it may be possible to borrow against the increasing

cash value of the annuity to finance the interest payments due on the loan. By
this strategy, which Miller and Scholes dub "dividend laundering" it is possible
to build

a portfolio with the risk—return structure of the stock, but with the

tax deferral advantage of the annuity.3 In an optimal portfolio enough income
would be sheltered in this fashion to bring the taxpayer's current bracket rate
on ordinary income down to the effective bracket rate on capital gains. Because
this strategy minimizes taxes without changing the risk—return structure of the
portfolio, it dominates any portfolio with a lesser amount of debt.
Absent any other consideration this arbitrage opportunity would not
explain the existence of dividends, because capital gains could be sheltered

through the same mechanism. Indeed, because of the sixty percent capital
gains exclusion, the distribution of profits as capital gains would economize

on the possibly costly tax shelter. The hypothesized preference for dividends is a consequence of Section 163(d) of the Internal Revenue Code, the

investment interest limitation.

—3—

That regulation effectively limits the deduction of interest paid to mortgage
payments plus dividend and interest income plus 10,000 dollars.5
The intent of this rule was to allow deductions for interest paid on
mortgages and loans used to purchase assets producing taxable income and to
disallow the deduction if the proceeds of the loan are invested in a tax

favored device. Actually, any amount of interest or dividend income may be
sheltered with this device but the regulation does restrict the ability of
taxpayers to shelter labor income from taxation and it introduces an additional distinction between the taxation of dividends and that of capital

gains. For the taxpayer constrained by this section marginal capital gains
are

taxed at the regular capital gains rate but each additional dollar of

dividend income would allow the taxpayer to increase his borrowing suf-

ficiently to wipe out the additional tax liability. Such taxpayers may
expected
those

to prefer firms

be

to pay out profits as dividends rather than convert

profits to capital gains. Simply put, increased dividends allow the

taxpayer

who is constrained by the limit on interest deductions to increase his

borrowing for investment in tax shelter annuities. If this situation were
widespread, and the reasoning in Miller and Scholes' paper suggests it might
be, section 163(d) would provide an explanation for the observed dividend
policy of pubic corporations.

Section 163(d) is a recent addition to the tax law. An early version in
effect from 1969 to 1915 set a maximum investment interest deduction of 150%
of the sum of $25,000 and investment income, but investment income was
defined to include realized capital gains as well as interest, dividends,

rents and royalties. Only in the Tax Reform Act of 1975 were capital gains

_)4..

excluded from investment income, so that only for tax years 1916 and beyond
does section 163(d) have any possible relevance to the dividend payout

sion. While there has been some increase in dividend payouts since 1975
there remains a very large base ——23 billion dollars ——

wanting explanation.

Miller and Scholes' article contains almost no data to support their

conclusions about the importance of section 163(d). The figures offered by
them on aggregate tax sheltered investment and aggregate interest deductions
are consistent with all or no taxpayers preferring dividends to capital
gains, depending on the correlation between investment in tax shelters and
debt.

A measure of the fraction of dividends received by taxpayers constrained or
nearly constrained by section 163(d) would be the most powerful empirical test
of dividend laundering as an explanation for observed dividend payouts.
Fortunately quite conclusive evidence on who receives dividends is available in

the 1977 Tax Model file prepared by the U.S. Treasury. The Tax Model is a
public use sample of 155,000 actual federal income tax returns selected from the

universe of 86 million returns. Because the sample is weighted heavily towards
high income taxpayers (and includes the return of every taxpayer with any income
item over 200,000 dollars) sampling errors are roughly independent of income

level. For reasons of econonr in this tabulation a subset of the treasury file
is used including one half of the returns with adjusted gross income over 200,000
dollars and one tenth of all other returns.

In

Table one column five shows the number of taxpayers constrained or

nearly constrained by section 163(d). A taxpayer is regarded as being nearly
constrained if a reduction in dividends of one thousand dollars would subject

him to the limitation on the deduction of investment interest. The estimate
number of such taxpayers is small; however in the highest income categories

almost 1/3 of taxpayers are constrained. Columns six and seven show the total
dividends received by all taxpayers and by constrained (or nearly constrained)

taxpayers, respectively. Miller and Scholes do suggest that the number of
constrained shareholders may not be very relevant to the dividend payout deci-

sion ——they may be few in number but important in corporate decision making. In
no income class do constrained taxpayers receive as much as fifteen percent of
dividend income for that class, and overall they receive only about two and one

half of percent of such income. It is not credible that so small a segment
of the ownership of a public corporation could determine dividend policy to the

detriment of the other taxable owners of the stock. Nor does the conclusion
change significantly if the point estimate of dividends received by constrained
taxpayers is off by several standard errors.
Because the constraint implicit in section 163(d) is not binding for any
significant fraction of taxpayers, or for taxpayers receiving any significant
fraction of dividend income, it is impossible to ascribe to that section any
significant role in the determination of corporate dividend policy.

The more complicated procedure does manage to avoid a capital

gains realization. The point to remember is that the borrowing and lending
doesn't create any new tax shelters, it simply alters the rewards of those which
already exist.

3or fairly detailed, but hardly conclusive views of the legality of this procedure, the reader is referred to Klein (1962) and Asiniov (1977). In principle
the interest deduction may be disallowed if the combination of loan and tax
shelter has no significant beneficial function other than the reduction of

taxes. In practice the IRS is likely to disallow the deduction if the only
security for the loan is the cash value of the shelter. For the taxpayer with a
small enough spread between his borrowing and lending rate this need not be a
serious obstacle, since some other collateral may be used.

Details of Section 163(d) are in Bierman and Stechel (1977).

5Briefly, the investment interest deduction is the interest deduction less the
home mortgage deduction.
