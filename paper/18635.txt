Six Decades of Top Economics Publishing: Who and How?
Daniel S. Hamermesh
NBER Working Paper No. 18635
December 2012
JEL No. B20,J24
ABSTRACT
Presenting data on all full-length articles published in the three top general economics journals for
one year in each of the 1960s through 2010s, I analyze how patterns of co-authorship, age structure
and methodology have changed, and what the possible causes of these changes may have been. The
entire distribution of number of authors has shifted steadily rightward. In the last two decades the
fraction of older authors has almost quadrupled. The top journals are now publishing many fewer
papers that represent pure theory, regardless of sub-field, somewhat less empirical work based on publicly
available data sets, and many more empirical studies based on data assembled for the study by the
author(s) or on laboratory or field experiments.

Introduction
Navel-gazing has been a favorite activity of economists (and other academics) for at least

60 years. George Stigler (1959) discussed the effect of economics training on political views,
and Committee (1965) discussed NSF data on the labor market for economists. One hopes that
the rationale for this activity is that it stimulates more than just a prurient interest, and that it can
enhance our understanding of the process of scientific discovery, the nature of interpersonal
interactions and the role of rewards and incentives in stimulating activity. These last are my
purposes here too—but I also hope to provide the enjoyment that contemplating our navels might
offer.
The novelty here is several-fold. First, the journal literature studied is a sample of
articles published in the leading general economics journals in six consecutive decades, thus
offering a long-term perspective on trends in the demographics and focus of economic research
at the highest levels. Second, I examine changes in the age structure of authors and in the
methods they use (not their topics), neither of which appears to have been considered before.
Finally, in addition to presenting some new facts I offer opinions and possible explanations for
them. The purpose is not to test the roles of possible causes underlying the phenomena shown
here, but to stimulate speculation and hopefully to generate formal examinations of them.
II.

The Data
The sample consists of the 748 full-length refereed articles published in the American

Economic Review (AER), Journal of Political Economy (JPE) and Quarterly Journal of
Economics (QJE), the leading American general economics journals, in one year in each of the
past six decades: 1963, 1973, 1983, 1993, 2003 and 2011. I exclude notes, comments/replies

and addresses/speeches.1 There are 1269 names attached to these papers, representing 1100
different authors. The data collected for each article/author are the number of authors on each
paper and each author’s gender (both easy to obtain), each author’s age (more difficult, and
unobtainable for 1 author of a single-authored paper in 1963) and the methodology employed
(acquired by skimming each paper). I classify methods into five types: Theory; theory with
simulation; empirical using borrowed data; empirical using self-generated data; and
experiment. Theory with simulation includes calibration in macroeconomics; borrowed data
are all data sets that are copied directly from books (the old technology) or provided
electronically; self-generated data include data sets assembled from diverse electronic or other
sources; and experiments include both laboratory work and author-initiated field experiments.2
III.

The Demographics of Authorship and Co-authorship
Table 1 presents the changing age and gender distributions of authors of articles in these

three leading publications.3 In the first four decades of the sample there was very little change in
the age structure of authorship. Only a tiny fraction of authors were older than 50, with roughly
half being 35 or less, consistent with Harvey Lehman’s (1953) path-breaking results on the age
distribution at which creative achievements were achieved in a wide range of fields.4 By 2003
and 2011 the age distribution of authors of top-journal publications had shifted markedly
rightward, so that today nearly 20 percent of authors are 51 or older, with around 6 percent being
over 60.
1

I used the data for the first four years in Daniel Hamermesh (1996). I chose 1963 for personal reasons—I started
writing publishable articles in 1964—and 2011 was the most recent available year.

2

Because of the tremendous changes that have taken place in publishing over these six decades, I could not classify
seventeen articles published in 1963 under any of these rubrics.
3

The means and distributions are all weighted by the inverse of the number of authors of each paper. Inferences from
unweighted data are nearly identical.
4

The minimum age in the sample was 24, the maximum was 77.

2

These changes in the age structure are striking, and their causes have apparently not been
examined. Some candidate explanations might be:
1. People are starting their careers later, causing an increasing left-truncation of
the age distribution. The median age at doctorate in economics in the U.S.
was 32.5 in the early 1960s and fell to 30.6 by the late 1970s. It did rise to
32.3 by the early 1990s, but from then to the mid-2000s it fell back to 31.7
(AEA, 2008). This explanation is thus inconsistent with the facts. Perhaps,
though, the average age of faculty, as opposed to all Ph.D.s, has risen due to
secular declines in new hires.5
2. The publishing process in economics has slowed considerably (as Glenn
Ellison, 2002, documents), perhaps by two years. Taking all the papers from
1963-93 and adding two years to each author’s age, the weighted distribution
of authorship would have been 27.9 percent, 64.5 percent, 5.9 percent and 1.7
percent. In the two older categories this is little different from the actual
distribution in 1993, but much different from the actual distribution in 2011.
This explanation accounts for very little.
3. The internationalization of the profession has resulted in older, foreign-based
scholars substituting for their younger, North American counterparts in these
samples. It is true that the share of U.S./Canada based authors fell (from 92
percent in 1963-93 to 83 percent in 2003 and 2011); but in the last two years
the average age of authors based in the U.S./Canada was 41.0, but was 40.7 of
those based elsewhere. This explanation is wrong.
4. The publishing slowdown, coupled with unchanging and short tenure clocks,
may have created incentives for younger scholars to shy away from these top
journals (where the acceptance rates today average 7 percent) to top-level
field journals, where the likelihood of an article being accepted is greater.
There is some evidence for the highest-ranked departments showing a shift
away from peer review (Ellison, 2011). On the other hand, the scarcity value
5

A slightly related possibility is that editors are now older and tend to favor their contemporaries. The latter may be
true; but the article-weighted age of editors who would have handled the 1963 papers was 53, that of the editors and
co-editors who would have handled the 2011 papers was 52.

3

of publishing in one of these journals has increased, presumably along with
the effects of such publication on the likelihood of being granted tenure.
5. The increasing complexity and specialization in this “science” may have
increased the “incubation” time before one can publish top-notch articles (see
Benjamin Jones, 2009).

Whether this is consistent with the changing

methodology of leading publications (see the next Section) is not clear.
Perhaps too, as the field has matured the rate of obsolescence of one’s
graduate education and early training has slowed.
6. Perhaps older economists are now healthier and more energetic than those in
previous cohorts. This may be true for those ages 61+, but 55-year-old
professors in the 1980s were hardly decrepit; and at least in the aggregate the
improvement in health in this age range seems minor. 6
7. The abolition of mandatory retirement for faculty in 1994 has increased the
monetary incentives to continue publishing. Salaries of senior professors have
fallen sharply relative to those of junior professors. This might have reduced
incentives for junior faculty to publish (and attain promotion and fullprofessor salaries).7
8. The growth of consulting opportunities is hard to document, but their lures
may provide a growing incentive to publish well while young to establish
one’s bona fides in the lucrative consulting world. This would shift the age
distribution leftward, opposite what has occurred. The continuing growth in
the relative demand for provostlets and deanlets, who I assume cease
contributing to the scholarly literature, provides an additional incentive in this,
the opposite direction from what we observe.

6

Among people 55-64 the percentage rating their health as fair or poor has declined only slightly, from 20.7 percent
in 1991 to 19.4 percent in 2010 (NCHS, 2011).
7

In 1983-84 the ratio of academic-year salaries of full professors to those of assistant professors in Ph.D. granting
economics departments was 1.77. It has fallen nearly steadily thereafter, to 1.57 in 2011-12. Thanks to Charles
Scott for providing unpublished data for years before 1996-97.

4

Table 1 also shows the sharp increase in the fraction of authors who are women, with the
share of female authors nearly tripling over this period.

This is clearly the result of the

increasing femaleness of the profession. While the share of female authors in the 1963 and 1973
samples is not much different from the female share of new doctorates in those years, however,
the growing share of female doctorates far outpaced the growing share of authors in these top
journals.8 Moreover, the female share of authors is now far below the female share of tenurestream faculty at Ph.D.-granting institutions (AEA, 2012).
Categorizing authorship by age and gender, it is notable that in 2003 and 2011 women
ages 35 or less accounted for 16 percent of all authors in that age group, an increase, but still far
below the 29 percent female representation among assistant professors at Ph.D.-granting
institutions in 2011-12 (AEA, 2012). Whatever the causation, perhaps this deficit explains the
greater (and uniquely greater to economics) female survival rate without tenure in this profession
(Donna Ginther and Shulamit Kahn, 2004).
Many students of the sociology of economics have pointed out the increase in coauthorship (e.g., Aidan Hollis, 2001), which, as the first column in Table 2 shows, has proceeded
over the entire last half century. What is less well known is that the frequency distribution of the
number of authors per article has been moving steadily rightwards, as the second through fourth
columns of the table show. The first four-authored paper in this sample appeared in 1993, and
the first five- and six-authored papers did not appear in this sample until 2011.9

8

In the 1960s the female share of new doctorates was below five percent, while from 2000-06 it was around thirty
percent (AEA, 2008).
9

I treat one many-authored paper from 1983 as having only the one senior author who appears to have been assisted
by a large number of students.

5

Why has this change occurred? A few possibilities suggest themselves and are worth
exploring:
1. The degree of complexity of economic research has increased to the point
that it is very difficult for single individuals to produce research that meets
the highest standards of publication.
2. The creation of email, the internet and inexpensive travel have lowered the
cost of co-authoring with non-colleagues. As Hamermesh and Sharon Oster,
2002, show, distant co-authorships have sharply increased their share of all
co-authorships.
3. Co-authoring is fun, especially with old friends or those in distant places to
which one can travel for joint work and leisure.
4. Also on the supply side, in this increasingly rat-race world it is difficult to
find people to read drafts of one’s papers. Co-authoring obligates others to
read one’s work, since it is also their own.
5. The returns to having one’s name on two two-authored papers exceed those
of publishing one single-authored paper of equal quality. While Raymond
Sauer (1988) demonstrated in the mid-1980s that the monetary payoff to a coauthored article was almost exactly half that of a sole-authored paper, one
wonders whether that is still true today.10
The formation of co-authorships will depend on the potential productivity of possible
partnerships and on individuals’ preferences for forming co-authorships with other scholars of
different ages (see John McDowell and Michael Melvin, 1983, and Matthias Krapf, 2012). How
does this depend on the ages of potential authors? One’s first reaction is that much of the coauthorship might be of the older European model, with the senior professor co-authoring with
his/her Ph.D. student/recent graduate. The probit and ordered probit estimates in Table 3 provide
10

One school offers salary bonuses X for publications, graded by the quality of the journal, with the bonus equaling
an amount X/√N, where N is the number of authors. One young economist told me that, in recognition of the
profession’s unwillingness to divide by N, a friend and he now put each other’s names on each paper.

6

an initial suggestion that this may be the case, as authors ages 36 to 50, the most active mature
scholars, are significantly and substantially more likely than younger or older authors to choose
to co-author.11
Going behind the estimates to particular co-authorships suggests that this model does not
characterize most of these publications. Fifty-five percent of the two-authored papers in the
sample are produced by people within five years of age (and in 2011 only two represented
collaborations between young faculty and their current or recent Ph.D. student). The only
(weak) evidence for this inference is that in only 35 percent of the 85 three-authored articles is
the average absolute age difference among the authors five years or less, and in nearly half of
them the oldest author is more than 10 years older than the youngest.12 At the very least,
however, most the greater propensity of prime-age scholars to coauthor does not appear to be
attributable chiefly to their publishing with Ph.D. students.
Using a sample of articles from these three journals for the 1990s, Anne Boschini and
Anna Sjögren (2007) find women are less likely to coauthor than men. The probit and ordered
probits in Table 3, covering a much longer time period, weakly suggest the same conclusion.
Moreover, an expanded specification that interacted gender with time showed that this difference
has not changed over these six decades. To the extent that economics faculties do not “divide by
N” in judging young faculty members’ publications at tenure time, this deficit may also help
explain the unusually high rates of “survival” without tenure among female economists. But

11

Indicators for each journal are also included, with articles in the AER having significantly more authors than those
in the other two journals. The average age in two-author articles ranges from 28 to 64, in three-authored articles
from 30 to 56.
12

In 7 of the 16 four-authored articles the average absolute age difference is five years or less.

7

when they do co-author, women are also typically not “junior partners” to their male colleagues:
In 26 of the 40 two-authored mix-gender co-authorships the scholars are within five years of age.
IV.

Changing Methodology and Its Demographics
It is easy to obtain authors’ classifications of their published papers by subject (JEL

code), but subject does not automatically imply method:

For examples, one can imagine the

currently in vogue method of field experiments being used in such broadly diverse areas as
industrial organization, labor economics and public economics; and a purely theoretical study
could be published in almost any subject area. The issue here is not the subject, but rather the
methodological focus of the top journals, its secular changes and their causes.
Table 4 presents the five-fold categorization of the methods used in these leading articles
in the samples from each of the six decades (excluding those from 1963 that simply could not be
classified under these rubrics). In the first three years in the sample the leading journals almost
exclusively published articles that were either theoretical or that contained empirical work based
on ready-made data (typically government-provided macroeconomic time series or, beginning in
the early 1970s, large household surveys that the author(s) laboriously obtained and massaged on
a mainframe computer).13 Since then the share of purely theoretical articles has plummeted, with
most of the decline taken up by empirical studies for which the author(s) created the data set.
The rest of the decline is accounted for by growth in theory with simulation (mostly
macroeconomic calibrations) and experimental work (either in a laboratory or in the field).
Why the changing focus in these top journals? Some possibilities are:
1. Changing technology in the form of the internet has made it much easier to create
one’s own data by assembling information from a variety of previously unrelated
13

Observing this pattern led one Nobel Prize winner to complain about the sterility of the field (Wassily Leontief,
1982).

8

sources. Similarly, the declining price and easier access to large-scale computing
facilities has facilitated simulating/calibrating complex general equilibrium models.
2. The creation of economics laboratories, typically governmentally funded but, more
than anything else due to path-breaking work by one economist, has generated a new
methodological sub-field that is reaching maturity.14
3. Economic theory may have become so abstruse that editors of the leading general
journals, recognizing that very few of their readers could comprehend the theory,
have cut back on publishing work of this type.
Table 5 presents multinomial logit estimates of a model describing the demographic
correlates of the choice of methodology.

Other than the time trends, which replicate the

percentage distributions in Table 4, the central results are: 1) Women are much less likely than
men to publish theoretical papers; 2) With one notable exception there are no significant
differences by age in the propensity to publish using different methodologies. Moreover, an
expanded model shows that the differences, or lack of differences, have not changed over these
six decades.15
The one significant age difference in method is the fact that older authors have been
more likely than others to publish theory articles. This finding contradicts a claim made by a
theorist in a lunchtime conversation, “Empirical work is what you do when you can’t do theory
any longer.” The evidence from these repeated cross-sections suggests that assertion is wrong.

14

The Nobel citation to Vernon Smith was, “For having established [bold mine] laboratory experiments as a tool in
empirical economic analysis, especially in the study of alternative market mechanisms.”

15

The equations also include indicators for each journal. There are significant differences in methods in these articles
across the journals, with the QJE being more likely to publish purely theoretical papers and those with selfgenerated data, and both the JPE and the QJE being less likely than the AER to publish experiments.

9

Cross-section data may not, however, be the correct test of this (to an elderly empirical
researcher in a youth-oriented profession, very annoying) claim. Eighty-two authors appear in at
least two different cross-sections (in different decades), so we can create an unbalanced panel
(since some authors appear three or even four times) to remove person fixed effects. Fifty-five
of these authors published at least one theoretical paper. Of these, 60 percent published only in
theory (with or without simulations), 9 percent published an empirical paper before a theoretical
one, and 31 percent published a theoretical article before an empirical one.16 But this result is due
solely to the secular decrease in theory papers in these journals: Looking only at longitudinal
data from 1963-93, the few authors who did switch are as likely to move from empirical work to
theory as vice-versa. The claim is simply wrong.
The simultaneous trends in the top general journals away from theory and toward
increasingly older authors are consistent with each other and with the observation (Lehman,
1953, across disciplines; Bruce Weinberg and David Galenson, 2005, for methodologies in
economics) that thinkers reach their peak productivity at younger ages in areas requiring more
mathematical thinking. They are, however, inconsistent with this evidence on the age distribution
of authors by type of method used.
The market determination of the type of methodology appearing in top journals has
changed, whether because of changes in editors’ preferences (either their own, or as agents for
preferences of members of the profession) or because of changes in authors’ preferences and
production technologies. So too the propensity to co-author has changed over time, although the
changes are presumably the result of changing conditions on the supply (of scholarship) side. I
have assumed that both trends have resulted from many possibly exogenous shocks, including
16

Taking the 22 “methodological switchers,” the probability that we would observe so many more switching in one
direction instead of the other is 0.002.

10

the demographics that I have identified. But even though I do not claim that it might be
causative, is there any interaction of these trends?
Table 6 presents estimates of a multinomial logit like that in Table 5, but excluding the
demographic variables and including only indicators for the number of authors (two, three or
more, with sole authorship the excluded category).17 The coefficients on the vector of indicators
of number of authors are jointly significant (χ2(8) = 35.62, p<0.001) and show that coauthorship, and especially multiple authorship, is more common in articles with self-generated or
experimental outcomes than in other types of studies. Unsurprisingly, theory is especially
unlikely to be the result of collaborations.
One might think that these patterns result from the simultaneous trends toward more
authors per article and self-generated data and experiments. They do not: Adding interactions of
the numbers of authors and the time trend to the specification underlying Table 6 yields terms
that are jointly insignificant (χ2(8) = 8.98, p=0.34) and individually statistically insignificant in
seven cases. The trends in the leading general journals toward increasing numbers of authors on
each article and away from theory have essentially been independent.
V.

Where Is Publication Heading?
Predicting changes in age structure of top-level authorship in economics is easy. Barring

some new, fundamentally different methodological approach for which the skills are learned
mostly by new or recent Ph.D.s (essentially as occurred with experimental methods), we will not
see a return to top-level publishing as a strikingly young person’s game. That prediction is
reinforced by my guess that the age distribution of academic economists will not shift leftward.
The abolition of mandatory retirement will lead to more people staying on after age 70, and it is
17

An equivalent way of examining this correlation is to estimate an ordered probit on the number of authors, with
indicators for the type of methodology as explanatory variables. Not surprisingly, that model gives the same
conclusions as the multinomial logit discussed in the text.

11

unlikely that we will see a hiring boom of young people at public institutions, which constitute
the overwhelming majority of the academic labor market.
We also will not see co-authorship diminishing. The same forces that have created
incentives for multiple authoring are, if anything, becoming stronger. Entries in Table 2 for
future decades are likely to show even higher percentages in the first four columns.
As important as they are, even viewed over the intermediate term of the six decades
covered here the methodological innovations that have captivated the major journals in the past
two decades—experimentation, and obtaining one’s own unusual data to examine causal
effects—are unlikely to be any more permanent than was the profession’s fascination with
variants of micro theory, growth theory and publicly available data in the 1960s and 1970s. No
doubt they will eventually give way in part to new approaches based on new methodological
innovations. Not in the next few years, but surely as reflected in leading journals if a replication
of this study is undertaken in 2043. Indeed, if it were not demonstrable then, an impartial
observer would reasonably conclude that the field had become remarkably stagnant and in-bred.
