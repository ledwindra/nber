Dollarization and Trade

NBER Working Paper No. 8879
April 2002
JEL No. F15, F33

ABSTRACT
Dollarization has been suggested as a policy that might, among other goals, promote trade
between a country adopting the dollar and the United States. Evidence supporting this conjecture could
be drawn from a recent series of papers by Rose and co-authors who show that a currency union increases
bilateral trade among its members, and that this effect is both large and statistically significant. In this
paper we show that this result is not robust if we consider bilateral United States trade (even though the
United States accounts for 60 percent of all observations of currency unions between industrial and nonindustrial countries), nor if we consider bilateral trade of countries that have adopted the United States
dollar, like Panama. Furthermore, the effect of dollarization on trade with the United States is not
statistically distinct from the effect of a fixed dollar exchange rate on trade with the United States.

I. Introduction
In the ongoing controversy over the appropriate exchange rate regime, events of
the 1990s have led some to the “bipolar view” that countries should either allow their
currencies to float or opt for a hard peg, like a currency union or dollarization.1 The hard
peg option is seen as having two potential benefits; providing a nominal anchor for
macroeconomic stability, and fostering trade integration between an emerging market
country and the industrial country to which it links its currency.2
The conjecture that currency unions foster trade integration could be supported by
reference to a series of papers solely authored and also co-authored by Andrew Rose.3
Rose and his co-authors demonstrate that membership in a currency union has a large,
statistically significant effect on bilateral trade patterns. Using data sets with tens of
thousands, or even hundreds of thousands, of observations on the volume of bilateral
trade, and augmenting a gravity model analysis with a dummy variable that indicates
membership in a currency union, a typical result is that the coefficient on the currency
1

Stanley Fischer (2001) offers an overview of this debate. It is worth noting at the outset that a
currency union and dollarization are conceptually distinct. A currency union involves the
establishment of a new central bank that may be administered by representatives from all
countries using the new transnational currency. Dollarization, in contrast, implies the adoption of
the currency of another country (typically the US dollar). While “currency unions” between nonindustrial countries and either the United States or Australia are better characterized as cases of
dollarization, we will use these terms interchangeably.

2

For example, Andrew Berg and Eduardo Borensztein (2000) write “Dollarization may also
bring other benefits: closer integration with both the United States and the global economy would
be promoted by lower transaction costs and an assured stability of prices in dollar terms.”
Rudiger Dornbusch (2001) writes “There is a whole range of economies that are doing all right
(say, Hungary or Mexico) that would benefit from the immediate introduction of currency boards
to deepen economic integration and hence build much better growth prospects.” (p. 242).
Alberto Alesina and Robert Barro (2001) state that Mexico and many Central American should be
interested in dollarization, based on, among other factors, their trade with the United States.

These include Andrew Rose (2000), Jeffrey Frankel and Rose (forthcoming), Reuven Glick and
Rose (forthcoming), and Rose and Eric van Wincoop (2001).

union dummy variable is highly significant and its value suggests that membership in a
currency union, ceteris paribus, nearly quadruples bilateral trade.4 Based on these
results, Rose and van Wincoop (2001) conclude that “Reducing these [trade] barriers
through currency unions like EMU or dollarization in the Americas will thus result in
increased international trade.” Frankel and Rose (forthcoming) offer estimates
suggesting that dollarization would raise the trade-to-GDP ratio substantially in many
Western Hemisphere countries.5
In this paper, we show that there is little robust evidence that dollarization
promotes greater trade with the United States, especially among those countries that are
the most likely candidates for dollarization.6 These results contrast with those of Rose
and his co-authors. The source of this difference is that this paper focuses on bilateral
trade for sets of dyads in which one country is the United States or sets of dyads in which
one country has a currency union with the United States (e.g., Panama). In the face of
possible parameter heterogeneity, results from these sub-samples offer a more precise
gauge of the effect of dollarization than do results from the much wider samples used by

4

For example, Frankel and Rose (forthcoming) present an estimated coefficient on the currency
union dummy variable of 1.38 in their Table 1, with an associated standard error of 0.19. This
result suggests that membership in a currency union raises bilateral trade by a factor of 3.97,
ceteris paribus, since the regressand is the logarithm of trade and e1.38=3.97. This result is cited
in Rose and van Wincoop (2001).
5

See their Table V. Some estimates include an increase in trade-to-GDP of 39 percentage points
in Guatemala, 24 percentage points in Chile, 91 percentage points in Costa Rica, 7 percentage
points in Brazil and 93 percentage points in Mexico.

Other work that revisits the analysis of the effect of membership in a currency union on trade
includes Volker Nitsch (forthcoming, 2002a, 2002b), Torsten Persson (2001), Michael Pakko and
Howard Wall (2001) and Silvana Tenreyro (2001). Sebastian Edwards (2001) presents evidence
on other effects of dollarization, including inflation performance, growth, fiscal performance and
the incidence of major current account reversals.

Rose and his co-authors.7 It is worth noting that dyads that include the United States
account for 60 percent of the cases of currency unions between industrial and nonindustrial countries that have complete data and can be used in the empirical analysis.8 In
fact, the only industrial country other than the United States that has usable data for
sustained currency unions with more than one country in the post-Bretton Woods era is
Australia, which had currency unions with the small island nations of Kiribati, the
Solomon Islands and Tonga. Dyads including Australia represent another 25 percent of
all dyads with currency unions between industrial and non-industrial countries.
One might expect to find larger estimates of the effect of currency unions on trade
in the sub-sample of dyads in which one country is the United States, as compared to the
wider samples used by Rose and his co-authors, since, presumably, countries in sustained
dollar currency unions are those that most benefit from membership and increased trade
with the United States is one such benefit. However, this is not the case. For example, as
shown in Section II.1, the coefficient on the currency union dummy variable is highly
significant for the full sample, and even larger and almost as significant for trade between
industrial and non-industrial countries. But, as shown in Section II.2, the coefficient on
the currency union dummy variable is only about one-third as large using the sample of
7

A related question linked to the issue of parameter stability across subsets of the wide sample
has to do with the likely trade effects of EMU. The only observations in the samples used by
Rose and his co-authors that represent a currency union between industrial countries are those of
trade between Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland. Rodney Thom and Brendan Walsh
(2001) conclude that this currency union had only a negligible effect on trade, a result that Glick
and Rose (forthcoming) maintain “cannot be reasonably generalized.” (p. 9). Nitsch (2002b)
concludes that the currency union between Belgium and Luxembourg did not lead to a significant
increase in trade between these countries.

Here, countries with an IFS identification number less than 200 are classified as “Industrial”
while those with an IFS identification number greater than 200 are classified as “Non-Industrial.”
See the appendix for a list of “Industrial” and “Non-Industrial” countries.

dyads in which one country is the United States. This coefficient is not significant at the
5 percent level for all United States bilateral trade, and it is not significant at the 10
percent level when we slightly modify the way in which one of the control variables is
defined, or when we restrict the sample to all United States trade with non-industrial
countries. If we hone in even more closely on a sub-sample that reflects current and
potential candidates for dollarization, by considering dyads consisting of the United
States and other Western Hemisphere countries (a sub-sample that consists of almost 90
percent of the actual currency union observations for the United States), we find that the
currency union coefficient is about one-fifth of its full sample value and is not significant
at the 25 percent level. Furthermore, as shown in Section II.3, regressions using dyads
centered on countries that had a currency union with the United States fail to offer
significant coefficients on currency unions.
The regressions presented in Section II.4 consider the effect of a sustained fixed
dollar exchange rate, as well as a currency union, on trade with the United States. The
inclusion of the dummy variable for a fixed dollar exchange rate raises the significance of
the currency union dummy variable, but not beyond the 20 percent level for a regression
using the sample consisting of trade between the United States and other Western
Hemisphere countries. These regressions also show that dollarization does not have an
effect on trade with the United States that is statistically distinct from the effect of
maintaining a fixed dollar exchange rate, even though it is often maintained that
dollarization is somehow different than a fixed exchange rate along this dimension.
The one case in which we do find a robust effect of dollarization on trade is for
currency unions with the Australian dollar rather than the greenback. These results are

4

presented in Section II.5. But, as noted above, this result is based on currency unions for
three very small island nations and one may not want to generalize this result.

II. Currency Unions and Bilateral Trade
The basic approach used to determine whether a currency union promotes trade,
first employed by Rose (2000), is to augment a gravity model of trade flows with a
dummy variable representing membership in a currency union. The time-series crosssection model has, as its dependent variable, the logarithm of bilateral trade denominated
in thousands of real American dollars. The regressors include, along with a dummy
variable indicating membership in a currency union, the logarithm of distance between
the countries, the logarithm of the product of their real national incomes, the logarithm of
the product of their real per capita national income, the logarithm of the product of their
land areas and dummy variables representing the presence of a common border, a
common language, a free trade agreement, a common colonizer, political union, and
whether one country is an ex-colony of another. The specification of all of the
regressions in this paper replicates the functional form used in Glick and Rose
(forthcoming) that includes, along with these regressors, fixed effects for years. 9 The
data set used in this paper, which is from Glick and Rose (forthcoming), includes annual
observations on 165 countries (27 industrial countries and 138 non-industrial countries).10

9

Rose states on his website that he is most favorably disposed towards the fixed effects method
used in Glick and Rose (forthcoming). Two authors applying alternative estimation methods to
these data are Persson (2001), who uses a matching technique, and Tenereyro (2001) who
corrects for possible sample selection bias.

10

Rose makes other data sets on currency unions and trade available on his website but he states
that these data have been the most extensively checked. As noted in Glick and Rose
(forthcoming), there are many gaps in the data due to both missing data and values of trade that

5

Glick and Rose (forthcoming) use data from 1948 to 1997, but in this paper we focus on
data from the post-Bretton Woods period and all regressions use data from 1974 to 1997,
inclusive.11

II. 1 Full Sample Results
We begin by presenting two regressions, one that uses the full sample of dyads
and another in which the sample consists of dyads representing trade between industrial
countries and non-industrial countries. Table 1 reports the estimates from these
regressions, with the full sample results in Column I and the results from the regression
using the sub-sample consisting of trade between industrial countries and non-industrial
countries in Column II. This table also reports the number of total observations used in
the regression, the number of observations in which there is a currency union between
two countries, the percentage of total observations accounted for by dyads with a
currency union, and the geometric average of the bilateral trade variable.
The results in this table are typical of those presented by Rose and his co-authors.
For the full sample (Column I), the coefficient on the currency union dummy variable
equals 1.52 and the associated t-statistic is 9.11. This result suggests that a currency
union increases trade by a factor of 4.57 (exp(1.52) = 4.57), ceteris paribus. This result
is based on a sample with 152,960 observations, representing trade flows among 165

equal zero which, when the logarithm of trade is calculated, are set to missing. The appendix lists
the countries represented in the data set.
11

We focus on the post-1973 period since the effects of dollarization on trade would likely be
stronger when the rest of the world is not on a dollar-based exchange rate standard since, after the
Bretton Woods era, there is a greater distinction between dollarization and the exchange rate
arrangements of the rest of the world.

6

countries, a sample that includes 1,783 dyads with currency unions (1.17 percent of the
total sample). As shown in Column II, the estimated effect of a currency union on trade
between industrial and non-industrial countries is even larger, increasing that trade by a
factor of 5.53 (= exp(1.71)), ceteris paribus. The coefficient on the currency union
dummy variable is significant at more than the 99 percent level of confidence in this
sample, which includes 65,059 observations, with 175 of them representing dyads in
which there is a currency union (0.27 percent of the sample). In both regressions, almost
all the other regressors are significant at the 99 percent level of confidence.

II. 2 Dollar Currency Unions and United States Bilateral Trade
We next consider a sample in which each observation represents trade between
the United States and another country. This sample selection enables us to gauge more
precisely, in the face of possible parameter heterogeneity, the effects of dollarization on
trade. To begin, we list in Table 2 all the countries that had a currency union with the
United States in the post-Bretton Woods era and that had data for all variables used in the
regression, and the years during which they had a currency union with the United States.
For the sake of completeness, we also list all other currency unions in the post-1973
sample in which one of the countries is an industrial country and for which complete data
are available such that the observations can be included in the regression analysis.12 As
shown in Table 2, the countries that joined currency unions with industrial countries were
12

Observations in the data set that represent currency unions between industrial and nonindustrial countries in the post-Bretton Woods era, but do not have complete data, include three
currency unions involving the United Kingdom (with the Falkland Islands, Gibraltar and St.
Helena), two currency unions involving Australia (with Nauru and with Tuvalu), and the currency
unions between the United States and Guam, and between France and St. Pierre & Miquelon.

generally quite small. Among the usable, post-1973 data, dyads that include currency
unions with the United States account for 60 percent of all dyads between industrial
countries and non-industrial countries in which there is a currency union, and dyads that
include currency unions with Australia account for another 25 percent of the total.
Table 3 reports the results for gravity equations augmented with a currency union
dummy variable in which each dyad includes the United States as one of the trade
partners. Columns I.a and I.b in this table report regressions in which the sample
includes United States bilateral trade with all countries in the sample. The first column
uses the Glick and Rose data without modification. In this case, the coefficient on the
currency union dummy variable is 0.50, with an associated p-value of 0.065. Thus, this
estimate suggests that a U.S. dollar currency union increases trade by 65 percent
(exp(0.5)=1.65), but this result, significant at the 93.5% level of confidence, is much less
precise than those from the full sample cited above.
This result, however, is sensitive to a slight modification of the value of the
dummy variable that represents whether one country in the dyad was a former colony of
the other country in the dyad. In the Glick and Rose data set, the ex-Colony dummy
variable equals 1 for two sets of dyads involving the United States: the United States and
the Philippines and the United States and the United Kingdom. In the Column I.b in
Table 3, we modify this definition of ex-Colony for the United States by including both
the United States – United Kingdom dyad as a separate dummy variable and by scoring
the Unite States – Liberia dyad as one representing a former colonial relationship.13 The

13

Liberia, the only country outside the Western Hemisphere that had a currency union with the
United States in the post-Bretton Woods era, was founded in 1822 as a result of the efforts of the
American Colonization Society to settle freed American slaves in West Africa. Over the course
of forty years, about 12,000 slaves were voluntarily relocated. The colony became the Free and

8

results in this column suggest that it is important to separate a dummy variable for United
States – United Kingdom trade from that of the other two colonial relationships since the
coefficient on the US – UK trade dummy variable is negative whereas the coefficient on
the newly defined ex-Colony dummy variable is positive, and both coefficients are
significant at better than the 99 percent level of confidence. But more to the point, with
the inclusion of Liberia as an ex-colony of the United States, the coefficient on the
currency union dummy is no longer significant at standard levels of confidence, with its
p-value equal to 0.146 and its value falling by 30 percent to 0.35.14
Most of the countries that are seen as potential candidates for dollarization are
non-industrial countries. Column II of Table 3 investigates the estimated effect of
currency unions on trade between the United States and non-industrial countries.15 The
sample used in this regression includes 2,870 observations, which is 83 percent of the
number of observations in Column I, but with the same 105 dyads representing currency
unions as in the regressions reported in Column I. Note that the average level of trade
between the United States and non-industrial countries is almost twice that of the average
level of trade between all industrial countries and non-industrial countries. Comparing
the regression results in Column II with those in Column I.a (since we keep the original

Independent Republic of Liberia in 1847. The English-speaking Americo-Liberians, descendants
of former American slaves, make up only 5% of the population of Liberia, but have historically
dominated its intellectual and ruling class. (from the Learning Network site
www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0107718.html).
14

If we have the only modify the ex-Colony dummy variable by changing its value from 0 to 1
for the US – Liberia dyad then the coefficient on the currency union dummy variable is 0.45 and
the associated t-statistic is 0.25, resulting in a p-value of 0.076.

See the appendix for a list of all the countries used in the regression analysis, including the
breakdown into those that are non-industrial and those that are in the Western Hemisphere.

Glick and Rose ex-Colony variable), we see that most of the coefficients in Column II are
quite close to their values in Column I.a, but the significance of the currency union
dummy variable has now decreased such that its p-value is 0.126.16
A further refinement of the sample considers only trade between the United States
and countries in the Western Hemisphere since these countries are the most likely
candidates for a dollar currency union (as opposed to countries outside the Western
Hemisphere that may be candidates for linking their currencies to the euro or some other
currency). The average level of trade in this sub-sample is more than triple the average
level of trade between the United States and all non-industrial countries. Column III of
Table 3 presents the results of a regression in which one member of each dyad is the
United States and the other member is a country in the Western Hemisphere. This
sample includes 764 observations, 12 percent of which represent currency unions, a
figure that is much larger than in the other sub-samples. While distance, the product of
countries’ GDP, and common language retain their significance in this regression, the
currency union dummy variable does not (nor do some of the other control variables).
The p-value of the currency union dummy variable in this regression is 0.267.17

16

If we include Liberia as an ex-Colony, the coefficient on the currency union dummy variable is
0.28, with a standard error of 0.25, which implies a p-value of 0.267.

17

The only industrial country trading with the United States in this sample is Canada. If we
exclude Canada from the Western Hemisphere sample, the average level of trade is $3,003,233
thousand. In a regression with all Western Hemisphere countries but for Canada, the coefficient
on the currency union dummy variable is 0.29, with a standard error of 0.27, resulting in a pvalue of 0.279.

10

II. 3 Bilateral Trade of Countries Linked to the Dollar
The results presented in the previous section cast doubt on whether the United
States trades more with countries that have dollarized. A related, though distinct,
question is whether countries that have dollarized trade more with the United States than
with other countries. This question is addressed by the regression results in Table 4.
Each column in this table reports a regression in which the observations are all the dyads
that include the country listed at the head of the column. These countries are the ones
listed in Table 2 that had a currency union with the United States in the post-Bretton
Wood era. For reasons discussed in more detail below, we also include regressions
representing Argentine trade in Table 4.
The results in Table 4 provide little evidence that linking to the U.S. dollar
promoted greater trade with the United States.18 The only case where there is a positive
and significant coefficient on the currency union dummy variable is for the Dominican
Republic, in which case the estimated value of the coefficient is 0.83 and its associated pvalue is 0.06. In the other two cases in which the estimated coefficient is positive, the
Bahamas and Liberia, the p-values are 0.189 and 0.311, respectively. The estimated
coefficients on the currency union dummy variables are negative for the regressions for
Bermuda, Guatemala and Panama, although none of the associated p-values are less than
0.13.
Table 4 does provide an example, however, of an estimated currency union
coefficient that is both negative and significant (at better than the 10 percent level of
18

Furthermore, one might expect that these countries were the most likely to have demonstrated
trade benefits from a currency union since they did, in fact, choose to dollarize. Alesina and
Barro (2001) present a model in which the country that most gains from adopting the currency of
another country is one that is small, open, and has its trade centered with one particularly large
partner.

confidence). Argentina adopted the peso on January 1, 1992, with its value pegged to the
United States dollar at a rate of one peso to one dollar. This currency board continued
until December 2001, four years beyond the end of the sample of trade data available to
us. The column labeled “Argentina” in Table 4 reports an estimate of a regression for all
bilateral Argentine trade in which the currency union dummy variable is set equal to 1 for
the years 1992 – 1997. As shown in that column, the estimated coefficient on the
currency union dummy variable is –0.57, with a standard error of 0.31, resulting in a pvalue of 0.068.19

II. 4 Dollarization Versus a Fixed Exchange Rate
Rose (2000) distinguishes between the effect of a currency union on trade and the
effect of a fixed exchange rate on trade, writing “…a very stable exchange rate may not
be the same as membership of a common currency area. Sharing a common currency is a
much more serious and durable commitment than a fixed rate.” (pp. 10-11). Rose tests
whether the effect of a currency union on trade goes beyond its effect on stabilizing the
exchange rate by including various measures of exchange rate volatility, along with the
currency union dummy variable and the other regressors discussed above, in the gravity
trade equation. Rose finds that exchange rate volatility enters the regression with a
negative and significant coefficient. More to the point, the coefficient on the currency
union dummy variable is significant, even with the inclusion of exchange rate volatility
as a regressor.
19

While the decision to adopt a currency board in Argentina reflected the policy goal of monetary
stabilization rather than trade promotion, we might still have expected to see evidence of the
latter.

12

An alternative way to test whether there is a distinct difference between
dollarizing and having a fixed exchange rate, one that allows us to address this issue more
directly, is to include a separate dummy variable for a fixed exchange rate in the gravity
regression. While a relatively small number of countries dollarized, many more pegged
their currencies to the U.S. dollar at some time during the post-Bretton Woods era. Table
5 presents all the observations among the data used in the regressions in which there was
not a currency union but, nonetheless, there was a consecutive period of at least five
years during which the respective U.S. dollar exchange rates varied by less than 1 percent
each year.20 As shown in Table 5, there are 508 dyads among the usable data that meet
this criterion (recall from Table 2 that these data include 105 dyads in which there is a
currency union with the United States). These 508 dyads include 357 dyads between the
United States and another country in the Western Hemisphere (as compared to 92
currency union dyads), and 151 dyads between the United States and a country outside
the Western Hemisphere, either in Africa or Asia (as compared to 13 currency union
dyads).
In Table 6 we use these data on the occurrence of sustained fixed exchange rates
to augment the gravity trade equation. The regressions presented in Table 6 differ from
those presented earlier in this paper through the inclusion of a dummy variable denoting
the presence of a sustained fixed exchange rate that is not a currency union. The columns
represent results using different sub-samples of the data. The data used to generate the

20

For ease of exposition, we refer to the currency behavior for the country – year pairs listed in
Table 5 as fixed exchange rates, even though the dollar exchange rate may have moved by as
much as 1 percent over the course of a year. These data are from Shambaugh (2001) and were
kindly provided by the author. Shambaugh reports that a listing of annual exchange rate pegs
based on actual behavior, like the one in Table 5, differs from a listing based on the reported IMF
exchange rate status in only about 12% of the cases.

13

results in Column I are all dyads pairing the United States with any other country, the
data used in Column II includes all dyads between the United States and non-industrial
countries, and the data used in Column III includes all dyads between the United States
and other countries in the Western Hemisphere. The regressions in Columns I and III of
Table 6 are comparable to those presented in Columns I.b, and III of Table 3,
respectively, while the regression reported in Column II in Table 6 is comparable to the
one mentioned in footnote 16 in which the coefficient on the currency union dummy
variable is 0.28, with a p-value of 0.267.21
The results presented in Table 6 demonstrate that the augmentation of the
regression specification with a dummy variable representing a fixed exchange rate
increases the value of the coefficient on the currency union dummy variable and also
makes this coefficient more significant. For example, the coefficient on the currency
union dummy variable for a sample of all bilateral United States trade is 0.35, with an
associated p-value of 0.146, when the regression does not include a fixed exchange rate
dummy variable (Table 3, Column I.b), and this coefficient is 0.53, with a p-value of
0.039, when a fixed exchange rate dummy variable is included in the regression (Table 6,
Column I). But dollarization is not the only exchange rate arrangement that promotes
trade in this sample, as the coefficient on the fixed exchange rate dummy variable is 0.40,
with a p-value of 0.033. Furthermore, we cannot distinguish between the effect of a
currency union and the effect of a fixed exchange rate. As shown in Column I of Table 6,
the F-statistic testing the equality of the two coefficients is 0.32 and, with 3,404 degrees

21

The ex-Colony dummy variable in the regressions in Table 6 equals 1 for both United States –
Philippines dyads and United States – Liberia dyads. Recall that the ex-Colony dummy variable
used in the regression reported in Column II of Table 3 equals 1 for the United States –
Philippines dyad only.

14

of freedom, the p-value for the hypothesis that these coefficients are equal is 0.57. Thus,
while both coefficients are significant in this sample, we cannot distinguish between them
statistically and there is no significant evidence of a special dollarization effect on trade
different from that of a sustained fixed exchange rate.
The results in Columns II and III in this table demonstrate that the coefficient on
the currency union dummy variable in more narrowly defined samples is not significant
at the 95 percent level, even though the inclusion of a dummy variable representing fixed
exchange rates increases the size and significance of the currency union coefficient. For
a regression using a sample consisting of observations of United States bilateral trade
with non-industrial countries, the coefficient on the currency union dummy variable is
0.49 and the associated p-value is 0.093. For a regression drawing on bilateral trade
between the United States and countries in the Western Hemisphere, a sample that is
focused on countries that are most likely to consider dollarization, the estimated
coefficient on the currency union dummy variable is 0.39, with a p-value of 0.216. In
both of these cases, the coefficient on the fixed exchange rate dummy variable is
statistically indistinguishable from the coefficient on the currency union dummy variable
at standard levels of significance. Thus, there is no evidence that the effects of
dollarization on trade, to the extent that they exist at all, are distinct from the effects of a
sustained fixed exchange rate on trade.

II. 5 Dollarization Down Under
As shown in Table 2, Australia is the only industrial country other than the United
States in the post-Bretton Woods era that has had a sustained currency union with more

15

than one other country that has complete data and, therefore, can be included in the
empirical analysis. The currency of the Republic of Kiribati continues to be the
Australian dollar while the Australian dollar was the currency of Tonga up until 1990 and
of the Solomon Islands up through 1978. All three of these countries are small island
nations in the Western Pacific. Each is a former colony of Britain. Tonga became
independent in 1970, the Solomon Islands in 1978, and the Republic of Kiribati in 1979.
The estimated 2000 national income of these countries is $76 million for the Republic of
Kiribati, $900 million for the Solomon Islands and $225 million for Tonga, and the
estimated per capita national incomes are $850, $2,000 and $2,200, respectively.22
Table 7 presents estimates of gravity trade regressions for Australia to
demonstrate the effect of currency unions on bilateral Australian trade. Column I
presents the results of a regression in which the observations represent all dyads that
include Australia, while Column II presents the results of a regression in which each dyad
includes Australia and a non-industrial country. The coefficients on the currency union
dummy variables in these regressions are quite large and significant at greater than the
99.9 percent level. The coefficient on the currency union dummy variable is 2.68 in the
regression that uses all observations of Australian bilateral trade and 2.32 in the
regression using only observations of trade between Australia and non-industrial
countries. These coefficients suggest that a non-industrial country that adopts the
Australian dollar increases its trade with Australia by a factor of 10.18 (=exp(2.32)).
Because this very large effect is based upon an estimate that draws on trade between
Australia and three very small island nations, one might want to use some caution in
22

http://www.odci.gov/cia/publications/factbook.

applying this result to other countries. It is reasonable to be even more reticent to apply
the estimate from the full-sample Australian bilateral trade regression, presented in
Column I, that suggests that dollarizing (with the Australian currency) increases trade by
a factor of 14.58 (=exp(2.68)).

III. Conclusion
Proposals to dollarize economies are based on two goals, monetary stability and
trade integration. In this paper, we have shown that there is very little evidence that
dollarization promotes trade with the United States for non-industrial countries. This
result contrasts with what one might infer from evidence presented in papers by Rose and
co-authors that suggests that a currency union has the attractive property of promoting
trade. The source of the difference between the results in this paper and the results in the
work by Rose and co-authors is that here we focus on samples that may better represent
the behavior of potential candidates for dollarization. This distinction is important given
the possibility of parameter heterogeneity across samples. In fact, we do find evidence of
parameter instability, with differences in the estimated effect of currency unions on trade
between a full sample and a sample centered on the United States, as well as between a
sample centered on the United States and one centered on Australia. If anything, we
would expect these selective samples to be more likely to show evidence of a significant
effect of dollarization on trade. But we fail to find virtually any evidence that adopting
the United States dollar as a national currency increases trade with the United States.
