The Determinants of IRA Contributions
and the Effect of Limit Changes

by
Steven F. Venti
and

David A. Wise

To encourage employees not covered
for retirement, individual retirement

accounts (IRA) were established in

1974 as part of the Employee Retirement
the need to enhance economic

by private pension plans to save

Income Security Act. Emphasizing

well-being of future retirees and the need to

increase national savings, the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 extended
the availability of IRA's to all employees and raised the contribution

limit. Now any employee with earnings in excess of $2,000 can contribute

up

to $2,000 to an IRA account each year, with tax on the principle and
interest deferred until money is withdrawn from the account. The
conthined

contribution of an employee and a

non-working spouse can be as high as

$2250. A married couple who are both working can contribute $2000 each.
Current tax proposals contemplate

raising the individual IRA limit to $2500

and the (non-working) spousal IRA limit from $250 to $2500.
Tax-deferred savings are potentially an important component of
savings for retirement and could

represent a very substantial increase in

tax-free savings for many employees.

Indeed, a $2000 contribution to a

retirement account represents a future pension benefit greater than
many

employer-provided private pension plans. The availability of IRAs may also
have a substantial effect on national

savings. According to IRS data, total

IRA contributions in 1982 were over 29 billion dollars.

Despite the program's size and potential significance1 suprisingly
little is known about the determinants of IRA contributions. Thus the goals
of this analysis are: (1) to analyze the effect of individual attributes on

whether a person contributeS, (2) to determine the effect of individual
attributes on how much is contributed, and (3) to simulate the effect of

potential changes in contribution limits on the amount that is contributed

to IRA accounts. The results can be used to judge whether the goals that

The simulations suggest what this

cost is and what the cost of proposed changes

in the program would be. A

fourth issue, the effect of tax-deferred savings on net individual saving,
is not addressed in this paper but will be analyzed in future work.

The analysis is based on data obtained through a special supplement
to the May 1983 Current Population Survey.

Subsequent analysis will be

based on the 1983 Survey of Consumer Finances and a special Carnegie
Commission Survey of college and university employees.

incorporates the characteristics of both IRA and Keogh-like plans in the
United States, although the contribution

limits are quite different in the

two countries. The same statistical model

has been estimated on data from

both countries.

The major empirical findings may be summaried briefly: tax-deferred
savings plans are unlikely to be used

by low-income persons. Thus they do

not in general Substitute for private pension plans, since higher-income
persons are more likely than those with lower incomes to be covered by

private plans. Given income and other individual

characteristics, persons

with private pension plans are no less likely than those without such
plans

to contribute to an IRA. The findings

for Canada are very similar to those

for the United States. Since the limits

are very different, the similar

findings provide support for the statistical specification.
Simulations based on the parameter estimates for the United States
indicate that if the limits were increased in accordance with the
recently
proposed Treasury Department changes to the tax system, contributions would
increase by about 30 percent.

I. Descriptive Statistics
Since model parameter estimates for the United States will
ultimately be compared with those for Canada, the descriptive statistics in
this section are presented for both countries. For several reasons, the
data for the two countries are not

strictly comparable, although they allow

rough comparisons between the two countries.

Most contributions are made by middle income employees.

Although

32 percent of employed persons in the United States have incomes below
$10,000, this group is responsible for only about 10 percent of total IRA

contributions. Approximately 80 percent of contributions are made by
persons with incomes between $10,000 and $50,000. Persons with incomes
greater than $50,000 contribute only about 10 percent of total

contributions. In Canada, about 82 percent of contributions are made by
individuals with incomes between $10,000 and $50,000 and about 15 percent by

persons with incomes above $50,000. only 3 percent of contributions are
made by those with incomes below $10,000, as compared with 10 percent in the

United States. (See table 1.)
As shown in table 2, only 5 percent of persons with incomes less
than $10,000 made an IRA contribution in 1982 in the United States, and only

about 2 percent in Canada. The proportions of higher income groups making
contributions are similar in the United States and Canada, although
in general the proportions are lower in the United States than in Canada.
Whereas the IRA program is new for most people in the United States, the
Canadian RRSP plan was started in 1957.

Only 11 percent of all contributors in the United States have
incomes less than $10,000, 80 percent have incomes between $10,000 and
$50,000, and about 9 percent have incomes greater than $50,000. Again, the
percentages in Canada are very similar to those in the United States. Seven
percent of contributors have incomes less than $10,000, about 88 percent
have incomes between $10,000 and $50,000, and 7 percent have incomes greater

than $50,000.

Proportions that contribute to the contribution limits in the two

countries are shown in table 3. Because

the contribution limits vary

substantially between the two countries, the numbers must be viewed

accordingly.l In neither country does the

proportion contributing to the

limit in any income group exceed 60 percent. In
addition, women are

apparently more likely than men to contribute to the limit in the United

States, whereas in Canada the difference
least for persons with incomes below

seems less apparent, although at

$50,000 the proportion for women is

greater than for men, with the exception of the zero to $10,000 income

group.

Average contributions in the United States range from $75 for the
lowest income group to $1116 for those with incomes greater than
$70,000;

while the average contribution of

contributors ranges from $1517 to $1883.

(See table 4.) This suggests that

among those who contribute, a large

proportion in each income group contributes at the limit. Unreported
tabulations indicate that at very high income levels 85 to 90 percent of
all contributions are at the limit.

Contributions at the limit

The percent of employees with

ranges from about 3 percent for low-income to 50

percent for high income empoyees. The figures for Canada are comparable,
but the average contribution levels

are considerably higher, reflecting the

higher limits. In addition, the Canadian data pertain to both employees and
self-employed persons, while the US data

pertain only to employees and thus

exclude contributions to Keogh plans.

tend to make somewhat larger contributions than those who are not, and they
are also somewhat more likely to make contributions at the limit, as shown
in table 5.

In Canada, the limit on RRSP contributions increases with

income and the maximum is higher for persons without than for those with a

private plan. Thus for higher income persons, contributions are higher for

those without private plans. Nonetheless, for most income intervals those
with a private pension plan are more likely than those without one to
contribute at the limit.

In summary: the descriptive data indicate that IRAs are typically
not used by low income employees, and that they do not in general serve as a
substitute for private pension plans.

II. The Statistical Model
The results suggest that relatively unambiguous answers can be
provided to the three questions addressed in this paper.

On the other hand,

an analysis of the effect of tax-deferred accounts on net savings requires
related but new and somewhat more complicated statistical procedures, and it
seems apparent that the question will be answered only with more ambiguity

and less confidence than the first three. Thus it is important to set forth
the analysis so that questions that can be answered relatively precisely can
be distinguished from those that inherently leave more room for doubt. To
put in perspective the analysis conducted in this paper, it may be useful to
illustrate how it is related to a more general analysis designed to estimate
the net effect of tax—deferred accounts on individual saving.

goal in mind, a simple but general

illustrative model is described first.

It serves to motivate statistical analysis of each of the questions, while
providing a framework within which

the fourth question can be addressed. It

demonstrates succinctly how the first questions are related to the fourth.
The illustrative model also provides

motivation for treating the first three

separately from the fourth, although in principle, one general model could
be used to address all the questions jointly.

Estimation procedures

designed to answer the first three questions are then considered, with
particular attention to whether a correctly specified single behavioral
equation can be used to describe both zero and positive levels of

one
tax-deferred savings, or whether two behavioral relationships —describing whether a person is a potential
desired amount --

contributor and the other the

are required.

A. An Illustrative General Model
Decisions about the amount to save in various forms are undoubtedly
made jointly so that one decision cannot

is made. In addition, unmeasured

be considered fixed while the other

individual attributes are likely to affect

saving decisions in each of two or more different forms. Thus persons who
are observed to save more in one form are likely also to save more in
another, not because savings in one form
another but rather because they were more

induce them to save more in
inclined to save in any form.

This means that one must disentangle the effects of individual specific
attributes from the effect of savings in one form on savings in another.

-8-

The procedure outlined here addresses

these problems by considering

an individual's preferred allocation of current income to current
consumption, tax-deferred savings, and other forms of saving, and then how
observed choices are affected by the limit on the tax-deferred savings

alternative. Based on such a model, it would be possible to simulate, for
example, how total savings would be changed if the limit on tax-deferred

savings were raised or lowered. The procedure relies

heavily on the fact

that the optimal savings behavior of individuals who are not constrained
by
the limit differs from from the behavior of those who are, with statistical
correction for the fact that persons who are at the limit, everything else
equal, are likely to have a greater preference

for saving than those who are

not constrained; they are likely to save more in any form. In practice, the
idea is to estimate the

parameters of a "preference" function whose

primary

arguments are IRA contributions, at least one other form of savings, and

current consumption. Associated with the preference function are optimal
IRA contributions and optimal savings in other forms. In practice, it is

necessary to choose these "demand" functions to fit the
then to choose the preference function

observable data, and

consistent with them. The procedure

can be illustrated based on a simple preference function.
To illustrate the idea, suppose that preferences for consumption

and savings out of current income may be described by the simple form
—

-

where V is income,

-

112 1 2

S1 and S2 are tax deferred savings and other savings

respectively, and I3 and 2 are parameters to be estimated.

This function

-9-

is intended to represent preferences over possible allocations of current
income conditional on individual attributes like income and age, and
individual perceptions of the riskiness of different forms of savings.2

This approach allows inferences about the relationship of income allocation
to age, without constraining the functional form to correspond to a

particular life-cycle hypothesis. In practice, the parameters would depend
upon measured individual attributes and would be allowed to vary randomly

among individuals to capture unmeasured variation in individual preferences
for current versus future consumption as well as different perceptions of

risk, etc. In this simple case, the unconstrained optimal saving choices
are
S1 =

and

1Y,

But in fact, the optimal choice is subject to a constraint; S1
contributions cannot be greater than the IRA limit L. Until this limit is
reached, contributions obey the equations above. But more generally the

S1 and 2 functions are of the form

Thus there are two

been reached, savings obey the optimizing rule

reached, the savings function is of the form

[2/(1-1)](y-L)

This

individual characteristics like age, occupation, possibly income itself, the
tax rate, and other conditioning variables that would be likely to determine
individual preferences over possible allocations of current income. To
estimate the model, it is also necessary to choose a stochastic

specification for the s. One also needs to choose a specification that
allows optimal, or "desired", values S1 and S2 to be negative, since many
individuals will not save in any form and indeed will borrow.3

As emphasized above, this particular functional form is only for
illustrative purposes; the form that is ultimately chosen must be determined

by the data. But the simple example demonstrates how changes in the limit
may affect behavior. In particular. explicit reference to a preference
function assures a specification of savings S2 after the limit L on S1 is
reached that is internally consistent with the function that applies before

the limit is reached. And, in a fully specified model, estimates of the s
could be used to simulate the effects of changes in the limit L on total
savings, not just the effect on tax—deferred savings.

Estimation of the

S1 function is treated in this paper.4

B. Independent Analysis of Contributions to Tax Deferred Savings
Accounts
Within the general framework described above, one can treat
separately the tax deferred saving equation.

Careful treatment of that

component of the more general specification is the subject of this section.

There are at least two important issues to address in analyzing the

determinants of IRA contributions. One is simply that in addition to the

—12—

upper limit on contributions many individuals,
contribute at all to IRA (or Keogh)

indeed the majority, do not

accounts. The standard way to conduct

the analysis in this situation would be to use a Tobit model with
a lower
truncation point at zero and an

upper truncation point at the contribution

limit. The second issue, however, is

that the determinants of whether one

contributes at all may be different from

the determinants of how much one

contributes once an account is established.

short run effect of changes in

While it is true that the

contribution limits on total contributions is

determined only by initial contributors, there may be considerably
more room
to change total contributions
through increasing the number of persons who
contribute than by increasing the Contributions of current contributors.

It

is important, therefore, to understand the determinants of the
contributor
status decision.

1. Key Issues
To provide accurate predictions of

contributions and of the effect on

the determinants of IRA

Contributions of changes in the

Contribution limits, the most important

existir-ig

consideration in estimation is to

account for the existing limit on observed contributions

Thus, an

intuitive discussion of the effect of the limit on estimation,
together with
procedures that can be used to correct for
ideas in perspective, although

-it, helps to put the important

part of the discussion will be familiar to

many readers. Mathematical details of the

estimation procedure are

presented in appendix A.
Consider first the diagram in

figure 1. Suppose that the

—13--

relationship between income and IRA contributions if there were no
contribution limits would be represented by the line a +
given Y the average (expected)

by.

contribution would be a + bY.

That is,
Of course,

for any level of income V there would be a distribution of contribution
levels, represented by the wavy vertical

lines; not everyone with income

level V would contribute the same amount. Now suppose that everyone in the
sample faced a contribution limit L.

We would now observe no contributions

above L and presumably individuals who

otherwise would contribute above

this limit would in the face of the limit contribute at the limit. This
would give rise to a concentration of contributions at the limit, indicated
by the heavy dots at that level.

In addition, it is not possible to

contribute less than zero; we would observe a concentration of points at
zero, indicated by the heavy dots along

the horizontal axis. If we think

of fitting a line, say by least squares, to the data points that are
actually observed, we would obtain a fitted line something like the dashed
line in the diagram.

Suppose that from this fitted line we attempted to predict the
relationship between income and contributions S. It is easy to see that
this estimate would be a very substantial underpredictiOn.

Thus it is

clear that standard estimation procedures will not lead to plausible

conclusions in this case. And it should also be clear from the diagram
that the reason is that observed observations do not represent the
contributions that individuals would like to make were they not constrained
by the limit.

It is useful also to consider the distribution of contributions

for persons with a particular level of income, say *•
distribution is shown in figure 2.

An illustrative

If it were not for the limit at L and

the limit at zero, the distribution of contributions S would look something
like the bell-shaped curve, but as demonstrated in the figure above, we
know that we will not observe observations greater than L, and we will

observe no observations less than zero. The distribution of observed
observations between zero and L would look just like the underlying curve.

But instead of a distribution tapering off smoothly to the right and to the
left, there would be concentrations of observations at L and at zero.

The standard Tobit maximum likelihood estimation procedure that
takes account of this truncation effect is based on an assumed underlying
relationship like a + bY, as shown in figure 1, together with a

distribution of contributions around this relationship. In this case there
are three possible outcomes: the contribution is zero, it is between zero

and L, or it is at L. The values of a, b, and c that maximize the
likelihood of observing the sample values yield estimates of the

relationship labeled a + bY in figure 1, as well as the dispersion of

underlying observation around this expected value. Thus the estimates that
are obtained need to be interpreted as pertaining to this underlying

relationship. For example, b indicates the relationship between V and S if
there were no limit on contributions. Or, it tells us how an increase in
income would affect contributions as long as the contribution limit were
not reached; after that, contributions would be observed at the limit L but

—15—

desired contributions would be above L.
It is also important to realize that only persons who are

constrained by the current limit will be affected by a new higher limit.
(If the limit is lowered, of course,

increasingly large numbers of people

will be constrained by it.) With the help of figure 2, it is
easy to

determine the effect of small changes in L on contributions. Consider first
an individual whose observed contribution is less than L. Such an
individual could contribute more but chooses not to; he is not constrained

by the limit. His desired contribution level is less than L. So raising
the limit would not increase his contribution

level. Consider on the other

hand a person who is observed to contribute at the limit L.

If L were

raised, this person would likely contribute more. Thus the effect of
raising the limit by 1 is just 1 times the probability that the individual

is constrained by the limit. Somewhat more formally, we can write the
derivative as

L)

Thus for any individual the expected change in the contribution level is

equal to the probability that his underlying desired contribution is greater
than L.

It is also important to realize that this

derivative depends upon

the level of L. Suppose that L were farther to the right than is shown in

—16—

figure 2, say at L'. The effect on contributions of an increase in the
limit from L' would be much smaller than the effect of an increase from L
because the likelihood that an individual with income Y* would like to
contribute more than L' is much lower than the likelihood that he would like

to contribute more than L. While all people, or almost all people with
observed contributions at L would increase their contributions if the limit
were raised, very few would increase their contributions to the level L'.
Thus to infer the effect of an increase in the limit on contributions, it is
recessary to have an estimate of the underlying distribution of desired

contribution levels. With an estimate of the distribution of S given Y, it
is possible to predict the expected contribution given Y* for any level of
L.

2. Estimation Possibilities
In practice, estimates that address the issues motivated above can
be developed in several ways, depending on the hypothesized underlying
process that leads to observed contributions.

There are two basic

possibilities. One possibility assumes, as in the discussion above, that
zero contributions can be thought of simply as a special case of a single
underlying preferred contribution behavioral relationship.

That is, one

could think of a preferred contribution level that declines continuously
with decreases in income until the zero contribution level is reached. The

other general possibility is that there are two underlying behavioral
relationships that determine observed contributions: one relationship
describes the likelihood that a person will be a contributor and the second

—17—

relationship describes the desired contribution, should he be a contributor.
If only one behavioral relationship is assumed, there are at least

three ways to obtain estimates. The alternative procedures allow a test of

the underlying assumption itself. One procedure uses all observations
including those with zero contributions; the second

uses only observations

with positive contributions; and the third uses only the information on
whether a person contributes without using the amount of a positive

contribution.5 If there is, in fact,

only one underlying relationship that

determines observed contributions, then each of these methods yields
consistent estimates of the parameters of this

single relationship (except

for the third which yields estimates up to a variance scaling factor). If
the estimates based on the different groups of observations lead to
different estimates, then it is likely that the underlying process should be
described by two relationships.
If the goal of the analysis were only to predict the effect of

changes in the limits, it is reasonable to concentrate on those who
contribute and to allow the parameter estimates to be determined by this
group, since noncontributors are not initially affected by changes in the

limit. It is at least as important, however, to understand the factors
that determine whether a person is a contributor.

As emphasized above,

changes in the number of contributors at any limit could have a much greater

effect on savings than changes in the limit. To the extent that the
determinants of whether one is a contributor are different from the

determinants of the amount of the contribution, it is important to consider

-

-18-

both of these relationships. The formal details of a two equation model,
together with details of the single equation estimation possibilities and
related tests of behavioral assumptions are presented in appendix A.

C. The Empirical Specification
In the illustrative specification in section A above, desired
contributions to the tax-deferred savings account are of the form S =

Y.

A

direct statistical counterpart of this specification is:

(6)

S =

Yee

=

ayb.y,eC =

a0X1a1x2a2YV.ec

Based on estimates for Canada, this specification fits the observations on
positive contributions extremely well.

Note that the specification implies

that given Y (and the other variables X) the variance of S increases with Y;

the disturbance term is heteroscedastic. The specification also leads to a
constant income elasticity and is conveniently linear in logs. However this
specification is not appropriate if we incorporate
and, in the abstract, the possibility of

contributions at zero

desired contributions less than

zero. To consider whether the determinants of contributor status are
different from the determinants of the amount of positive contributions, a
specification that in principle allows negative as well as positive values
and one that also fits the observations on positive

contributions must be

used. Such a specification, and one that in practice fits the observed data
well, is of the form

S = a +
(7)

+

)Y

+ c

1+b
+rV+E
=a0+a1X1+a2X2+ ••• +Y

-19-

where i and £

are disturbance terms and the variance of

V(riY +

(8)

=

+

=

rY +

£ is

given by

a2

Thus the specification incorporates the property that the variance of S

increases with income, and it also allows for "desired contributions less
than zero. The elasticity of desired contributions with respect to income
is given by (1 +

b)÷(1 +

aIv)

and thus approaches 1+b as income

increases.6

For simplification, appendix A, that describes the details of the
alterantive estimation procedures, is written in terms of the specification
S =

X

+

, where

V(c)

a2. Development in terms of the above specification

may be obtained by replacing X by a +

1+b

and a2 by (aY2 +

a).

Recall

that the three single-equation approaches use: (a) all observations
including those with zero Contributions (two—limit

Tobit); (b) only

observations with positive contributions (one-limit Tobit); and (c) only

information on contributor status (probit). A two-equation model that
jointly estimates contributor and contribution outcomes is also described in

appendix A. This model permits the determinants of whether a person
contributes to differ from the determinants of the desired level of a
positive contribution and allows the stochastic components of the two
choices to be correlated.

In addition, the CPS data on IRA contributions
interval --

are reported only by

0, 0 to 100, 100 to 500, 500 to 1000, 1000 to 2000, etc. Thus

the probabilities of positive contributions are of the form

—20—

(9)

•[(u —

X)/a]

—

4[(1

—

X)/a]

where u and 1 are the upper and lower bounds of an interval and (.) denotes
the standard normal distribution function. Thus the likelihood function in
this case includes no density function terms; it is composed only of normal

cumulative distribution functions. This may be contrasted with the Canadian
data that record exact prositive contributions.

III. Results

A. Data
The data were obtained through a special supplement to the May

1983 Current Population Survey. The data on IRA contributions pertain to
the 1982 tax year. No information -is provided on 1982 contributions to

Keogh plans. Thus self-employed persons have been excluded from this
analysis. In addition, the raw data pertain to individuals, not families.
Some of the estimates reported below are based on the individual data, with

indicator variables for marital status and sex. Since it is not known from
the person data whether an individual's spouse works, the actual upper
limit on family contributions cannot be determined from the individual data

alone. Some individuals reported contributions greater than $2,000 --

primarily

at $2250 and at $4000, apparently confusing individual

contributions with the family total. When the individual data are used,
contributions above $2000 are not explicitly recorded at that level, but
rather any reported contribution above $2000 is treated as a contribution at

the $2000 limit. Under the model assumption, this procedure still yields

-21—

unbiased parameter estimates; it simply does not use all information.
Family data were created by matching and
for individuals in the same household.

combining information

This allows estimation of family

income and of family IRA contribution limits based on the employment status

of the husband and wife. Estimated

marginal tax rates were also calculated

for the family. The estimates were based on average marginal tax rates by
income and family status reported by the IRS. As mentioned above, IRA
contributions for each family member are reported only by interval. The
intervals for a family were obtained

by inferring the possible family

intervals from the possible individual

reporting intervals. There are 12

possible family intervals in total. Details of the procedures used to
create the family data and the tax rates are reported in appendix B.

B. Parameter Estimates: Single Equation Models

1. Person Data
Estimates by method of estimation are reported in tables 6 and 7.
Summary statistics for the variables included in each equation are presented

in appendix table 1. Table 7 includes variables indicating whether a
person
was covered by a private pension plan and whether the worker participated in
a salary reduction plan (401(K) or 403(B) plans which permit workers to
defer compensation); these variables are not included in table 6.

The first column in each table presents estimates based on the two-limit

Tobit specification. The second column shows probit estimates where the
standard error of c is set at the two—limit

Tobit estimate (e.g., 5622 in

table 6). This allows easy comparison of the two sets of estimates. it

may be seen that the parameter estimates are virtually the same. Whether
there is a difference between the determinants of contribution status and
the determinants of the desired level of IRA contribution may not be
revealed by this comparison, however, since the preponderance of individuals
make no contribution and thus the contribution status (the probit portion)

will dominate the two-limit estimates. The two-limit Tobit estimates will
therefore tend to look like the probit estimates.

A better way to reveal differences in the two relationships is to
separate analysis of contribution amounts from the analysis of contributor

status. The 1-limit Tobit estimates in column three of the tables are based
only on the contributions of contributors, and the probit estimates of
contributor status in column 4 are obtained by setting the standard error of

e equal to the one-limit estimate (e.g., 2026 in table 6). These last two
columns reveal that the two sets of coefficients are quite similar. The
reported coefficient on income is the estimate of (1 +

b).

It is virtually

the same in each of the alternative methods, and the estimated parameters on
age seem not to be significantly different in the two cases.

The estimated

sex effects are also very close in the two cases, with one exception.

The

estimates suggest that unmarried men contribute more than married men but
are apparently rio more likely than married men to contribute. The constant
terms in the two equations differ, although given the estimated standard
errors, the difference may not be as great as the estimated values suggest.

A more formal test is to compare the sum of the likelihood values

from columns 3 and 4 with the likelihood value in column 1. Under the null

—23-

hypothesis that one behavioral relationship is sufficient to describe both

contributor status and the amount of contributions, the sum of the
likelihoods in columns 3 and 4 will not be statistically different from the

likelihood value in column 1. Minus 2 times the difference will be
distributed chi—square with 7 degrees of freedom, with a .05 level of 14.1.
Thus, the hypothesis would be rejected in this case. However, the very
large sample size will reveal differences even if they have rather small
practical importance.

The coefficient on income of .753 implies an elasticitiy of desired
contribution with respect to income of .63, evaluated at the mean of the

data for contributors. The desired contribution

increases by about $110

with each year of age according to the estimates for contributors, while the

comparable estimate from the probit equation is $81. Given other variables,
married women would choose to contribute about $1000 more than married men
and the more educated would contribute more than those with less education.
The estimated unmarried women effect is

not statistically significant.

Summary statistics presented earlier in table 5 suggested that
employees covered by a private pension plan were more likely to contribute

to an IRA. Parameter estimates in table 7, however, suggest that the
association between pension coverage and IRA contributions can be attributed
to other differences in the individual characteristics of those covered and

not covered by a pension plan. After controlling for other characteristics,
pension plan coverage is not significantly associated with desired

contributions. Participation in a salary reduction plan (less than

—24—

4 percent of the sample) is positively associated with IRA contributions.
Both the two-limit and the one-limit models fit the data rather

well. This is demonstrated in table 8. Based on the estimates in table
6, the predicted proportion of individuals

with contributions at zero, at

the upper limit, and within selected intervals are compared with the

actual proportions, by income interval. It is important in interpreting
these results to realize that gross misspecificatiofl of the functional

form that relates contributions to income would be revealed in the

comparisons by income level. The comparisons indicate close
correspondence between predicted and actual proportions.

The only

apparent discrepency is that the two-limit Tobit specification

underpredicts the proportion of contributions in the $1000 to $2000 range
and correspondingly overpredicts the proportion of

contributions at the

limit. Given the differences between a few of the two-limt and one-limit
parameter estimates, the similarity of the predictions may be surprising.
However, the major difference in parameter estimates is a larger negative

constant term in the two-limit than in the one-limit specification, that
is offset by a larger disturbance term variance.

The likelihood function

is quite flat with respect to these two parameters.

Thus the sum of the

last two likelihoods is not in magnitude so different from the two-limit
Tobit likelihood.

Parameter estimates based on the family data are reported in table

with two exceptions: the

marginal tax rate has been added and the

dummy
variable for "married-women" has been deleted, with non-single-person

families the norm group. Married
family data, but as two separate

men and women appear together in the

observations in the person data.

Where the variables are the
similar to those based on the

same, the parameter estimates are very

person data. For example, the estimated

income coefficient based on the two-limit tobit model is 0.78
using family
data and 0.84 using person data. The effects of age and education
are also
quite close.
The results suggest no effect of the marginal tax rate on the
amount of Contributions but a positive

effect on contributor status. The

coefficient on the estimated marginal tax rate in the two—limit
specification is 200 with a standard error of 39. This would suggest that
an increase of 10 percentage points in

the marginal tax rate would increase

desired IRA contributions by about $2000. On the other hand, the
one-limit
and probit estimates in the last

two columns suggest that the tax rate has

no effect on the level of contributions

contributor status (column 4). The

(column 3) but a positive effect on

latter estimate implies that if all

marginal tax rates were increased by 10 percentage points -on average from
about 24 to 34 -- the
proportion of persons who contribute would increase
from .134 to .193, or by 44 percent.
Canadian estimates for 1981 (reported below) show a much smaller

statistically significant effect of the marginal tax rate on contributor
status, with a smaller and not

statistically significant effect on the

-26—

amount of contributions. (But the difference between the two estimates is
also not significantly different from zero.) Canadian estimates for 1976
show no effect of the marginal tax rate in either equation.7 An alternative
log-linear model for contributors only shows a precisely estimated zero
effect of the marginal tax rate on the amount of contributions in both 1976

and 1980. Thus the estimated effect seems quite sensitive to the
statistical specification.
Table 10 includes indicators of pension coverage and participation

in a salary reduction plan. These estimates indicate that if at least one
member of a family is covered by a pension plan, the likelihood of

contributing to an IRA is higher. The person data suggested essentially no
relationship. A possible explanation is that married persons without
pensions, but whose spouses are covered by a pension, have a high likelihood

of contributing to an IRA. In the person data, these people would be
treated as not having a private pension.

C. Simulations: Single Equation Models
Simulations are obtained under three policy assumptions: the
existing IRA program, the proposal contained in the administration's
recent tax reform proposal (U.S. Department of Treasury [1984]), and a

modification of the Treasury proposal that restricts spousal IRAs. The
Treasury proposal increases the limits to $2500 f or both employed persons

and nonemployed spouses. The modified Treasury proposal also increases
the limit for employed persons to $2500 but sets the spousal limit at

The model

for all families under the current

plan of $312. The simulations indicate that the Treasury plan would
increase 1982 contributionS by 30 percent to $405 per family. The largest
increases are for a married-one-earner families whose limit is increased by

the Treasury proposal from $2250 to $5000. The predicted average
contribution for this group would increase from $267 to $475, about 78

percent. The smallest increase, about 16 percent, is for
married..twoearner1' families whose limit increased only from $4000 to
$5000.

The modified Treasury plan yields an overall increase of about

18 percent. The limit changes, and thus contributor responses, for
unmarried heads and married-two-earner families are the same as in the

unmodified Treasury proposal. The modified Treasury plan increases the
limit faced by married-one—earner families by only $750, from $2250

to $3000, instead of $5000. The simulated increase in average
contributions by this group is 25 percent, about a third as large as the
simulated increase under the Treasury plan.
Simulations based on the person data are shown in table 12. Unlike
the family data, the person data do not provide enough information to
completely specify the limit faced by each person.

face a limit of $2000. For married couples the limits are $2000 per person
if both work and $2250 if only one works. If both work, then both will
appear in the sample and the appropriate limit for each is $2000.

If

only one is employed, however, the nonemployed spouse will not be present -in

the

sample, since only employed persons received the CPS pension supplement

questionnaire. The appropriate limit for the employed spouse is $2250. The
problem is to assign the "correct" limit ($2000 or $2250) to each married
person in

the sample given that we do not know if the spouse is employed.10

If the married person is a woman, a limit of $2000 is assigned, assuming

that her spouse also works. If the married person is a man, the limit is
randomly assigned. With probability P it is set at $2000 and with
probability 1-P at $2250, where P is the proportion of wives of

working

husbands that are employed.

The person data simulations based on this procedure are quite close

to those obtained using the family data. For all persons, the simulations
indicate the Treasury plan will increase 1982 contributions by about 33

percent and the modified Treasury plan will increase contributions by about

20 percent. The largest effects are for married men, the group facing the
/

largest

change in limits.

0. Parameter Estimates: Two Equation Model
The above results suggest that the observed outcomes can in general

be described well with a single behavioral relationship. If two
relationships are required, the one-limit Tobit and the probit models

-29-

together, even if estimated independently, should provide a reasonably

accurate description of the determination of contributions.

The

two-equation model described in appendix A, however, distinguishes between a

"potential" contributor behavioral relationship and the level of desired

contributions, were one to contribute. Under this representation, a
potential contributor could be observed with zero contributions not because
the person was a non-contributor, but rather because income say was too low
for the person to devote current income to future consumption.

To the

extent that the parameters in the two relationships differ, the

single—equation probit estimates, for example, will not provide accurate

estimates of potential contributor status. As the parameters in the two
relationships become close, and the correlation between them approaches 1,

however, the two-equation model approaches the two-limit Tobit

specification. If only the variable coefficients were the same, the results
could differ if the correlation between the disturbance terms in the two
relationships were not unity.

Estimation of several two equation models indicated only minor
differences between parameters based on the single equation models and those

derived from two relationships estimated jointly. The two equation model is

The details of the specification and estimation procedure are described in

section II of appendix A. The key distinction between the specification

•-30-

used here and the common sample selection specification is that even
potential contributors can have zero contributions, while others would not

contribute under any circumstances. Only the latter are "non—contributors"
in the strict sense.

Illustrative estimates for this model are presented in table 13.

Education is excluded from the

were required for identification of key parameters. Because the likelihood
function was so fiat, more restrictions were necessary than were in
principle required.

The parameter estimates indicate that the correlation between

c and

is not significantly different from zero.11 This suggests independence of
the contributor and contributions relationships, given measured individual

characteristics. Thus these estimmates are very close to the single
equation results presented in the last two columns of table 6.12
In principle, however, this specification allows estimation of the
proportion of persons who are potential contributors but because of. a

IV. Comparison of Results for the United States and Canada
Since the Canadian and the American systems are very similar in
their general outlines, it is informative to compare the model estimates for

the two countries. The Canadian equivalent

of IRA and Keogh plans Is the

Registered Retirement Saving Plan (RRSP). RRSP contributions are also
tax-deferred and have upper limits determined both by income and by a

maximum level, The Canadian rules also provide for different limits
depending on whether a person is a member of a private pension plan.
Since the Canadian tax system is on a person basis, the most

appropriate comparison is with the person estimates for the United States.
Estimates analogous to those in table 1 for the United States are shown in

table 14 for Canada. While the general model specification is identical
in the two countries, the specific variables do not correspond precisely.
In particular, the variables for women, married, and education are not
included in the Canadian version, and there is no marginal tax rate

variable in the United States version. The comparable parameter
estimates, however, are surprisingly similar, based on a comparison of the
one-limit Tobit and the corresponding probit estimates in the two

countries. The coefficient on income is .75 in the United States, while it
is approximately .81 in Canada. The estimated effect of age is

approximately $80 to $110 in the United States, while it is $65 to $80 in

Canada. The estimates for Canada also indicate a close correspondence
between the one—limit Tobit and the probit estimates, indicating that a
single behavioral relationship apparently describes the observations rather

well. Indeed for Canada the estimates in the two equations are not
statistically different, based on the chi—squared test described above.

As discussed above, the estimated effect of the marginal tax rate
in Canada is not statistically different from zero in the contributions
equation; the estimate for the United States, reported for the family data
in table 9, is also not statistically different from zero. In both

countries the effect of the

tax

rate on contribution status is positive,

although it is much smaller in Canada. As emphasized above, these results
are very sensitive to model specification and it may not be possible to
distinguish the effect of the marginal tax rate from a non—linear effect of
income.13

The parameter estimates from a more highly parameterized model for

Canada are shown in table 15. The variable temployee w RPP" indicates
individuals in Canada with a private pension plan. Neither estimate is
statistically different from zero, although the one-limit estimate is

quite negative. In the United States, there appears to be no relationship
between pension coverage and IRA contributions based on the person data,

although there is some evidence of a positive pension relationship in the
family data.

Because data in Canada are available for several consecutive years,

it is possible to check the validity of the model specification for that

country. Between 1976 and 1981, the Canadian Consumer Price Index increased
by about 60 percent, but RRSP limits did not change over the period. Thus
in real terms the limits declined very substantially between the years.
Thus a good external check of the predictive validity of the model is to use
estimates for one of the years to predict contributions in the other, when
the limit was either considerably higher or much lower.

Such predictions,

using the two-limit and the one-limit estimates reported in table 15, showr-i

in table 16. In general the predicted values are very close to the actual
ones. For example, one-limit estimates for 1981 underpredict 1976
contributions by only 1.7 percent, and one-limit estimates for 1976
underpredict 198]. contributions by only 1.1 percent. Estimates based on the
two-limit model also yield predicted values very close to actual values.
Since the parameter estimates in the two countries are rather close, this
suggests that the model should predict rather well in the United States as
well.

V. Conclusions
Persons with low incomes are unlikely to have IRA accounts. In
addition, after controlling for income, age, and other variables, persons
without private pension plans are no more likely than those with them to

contribute to an IRA. Indeed, if anything, those with private plans
contribute more than those without them. Both contributor status and the
amount of positive contributions are determined in large part by income and

to a lesser extent, demographic characteristics. The marginal tax rate may
have a positive effect on whether one contributes, but does not appear to

influence the contribution amount. Results based on different
specifications suggest that it may be difficult to distinguish the effect of

the marginal tax rate from a non-linear income effect. Simulations based on
the estimates suggest that the current Treasury Department proposal would

lead to about a 30 percent increase in IRA contributions.14 Model estimates
based on Canadian data for RRSPs are very similar to those for the United

States. External checks of the predictive validity of the model for Canada
indicate that predictions of the effects of limit changes are quite
accurate.

Appendix A: Estimation of IRA Contributions

To estimate IRA contributions, there are two possibilities: the first is to
assume that one underlying behavioral relationship leads to all of the observed

outcomes. In this case there are three ways to estimate the same parameters and
the difference between the estimates can serve as a basis for a test of the

assumption that one behavioral relationship is sufficient. If it is not, the
second method is to assume that observed behavior results from two behavioral
relationships, one pertaining to the decision to be a contributor and the other

describing the desired amount to contribute, were one a contributor. They are
described in turn. The first is familiar to many readers and the goal is simply
to make clear that, under the maintained hypothesis, the three approaches all

yield estimates of the same parameters. The second approach is not as familiar,
but is a generalization of a similar procedure in Deaton and Irish (1984].

Precise amounts contributed by each individual to an IRA are not reported.
Instead, we know if the individual did or did not contribute and, if a

used.

It is clear that (B) + (C) = (A)

this assumption is inconsistent with the data, the

estimated from (C). In addition, to the extent

that they differ, the sum of the likelihoods values from (B) and (C) will

be greater than the value from (A) since the "separated" models allow a

better fit to the data. Thus a test of the one—equation behavioral
assumption can be based either on a comparison of the estimated 's or on the
likelihood values. If they differ, a specification with two behavioral
equations may be indicated.

II.

IRA Contributors and Contributions: A Two-Equation Model

The purpose of this section is to describe a procedure that can be used to
relax the one—equation constraint. It is assumed that two behavioral

relationships determine the contributions that we observe. One is a
relationship between individual attributes and the likelihood that a person is a

potential IRA contributor. The other is a relationship between individual
attributes and the level of desired contributions, were one to contribute. Of
course, both of the outcome variables should be thought of initially as latent

variables. In particular, if the latent contribution variable is less than
zero, we shall assume that we observe no contribution, even if the contributor
latent variable is greater than zero. A desirable property of the model is that
it encompasses as a limiting case the standard Tobit model of section I.
The model is described by:

C=x+ C
S=XcL+17
where C -is the latent contribution variable and S the latent contributor
variable, X -is a vector of individual attributes,

parameters to be estimated, and c and i

and a are vectors of

are disturbance terms.17 We assume

-40—

that given X, C and S obey the covariance matrix:

=a

2

pa
1

where p is the correlation between C and 5, given X.
The bivariate distribution between S and C is represented graphically in the

figure below. The figure includes the limit on IRA contributions L. That is,
as usual, we will not observe contributions above L but will observe a

concentration at the level L. We shall assume that a person is a contributor if
the latent contributor variable S is greater than zero, and his desired

contribution amount is greater than zero. Thus when S and C are both greater
than zero we observe IRA contributions greater than zero but less than or equal
to L.

As in the usual Tobit case, there are three observable outcomes: IRA
contributions are zero, contributions are at some level C where C is greater

than zero but less than L, or we observe C at the limit L. The likelihoods
associated with these three outcomes are now

If indeed C and S are the same

two-equation

description of IRA contributions reduces to the Tobit specification. By

comparing the likelihood values in the two models, one can test explicitly
whether the single behavioral equation version can be rejected. The difference
between this test and those mentioned in section I, -is that the two equations
are allowed to be correlated.

Appendix B: U.S. Data Sources

All data for the U.S. -is from the May 1983 CPS and Supplemental

Survey of Pension and Retirement Plan Coverage.

Two data sets were

created: person and family.

A. Person Data
The CPS data -is arranged by person. The sample used includes all
persons meeting the following criteria:

1.
2.
3.
4.

Included in the supplement (working for pay)
Between the ages 16 and 65
Not self—employed
Containing valid responses for each of the variables used in
Table 7.

All summary tables and simulations (but not the estimated models)
using person data use the CPS weights designed to represent the nation as a

whole. No adjustment to these weights was made for exclusion of
observation due to invalid responses.

Several problems arose with the way the IRA variables were coded.
Employed persons were asked "Do you have an IRA?".

Those answering in the

affirmative were then asked: "Approximately how much of your own IRA did
you credit to your 1982 Federal taxes?" Responses are coded in the
intervals:

under $100
$100 - $499
$500 - 999
$1000 - 1999
$2000 — 2499
$2500 -

This categorization led to two problems. First, a surprisingly large
number of persons reported IRA contributions in the first (under $100)

—44-

category. Most of these responses probably indicate

persons establishing

IRAs prior to 1982 and making no contribution in 1982. We have thus
interpreted the first category to indicate zero contributions in 1982.
Second, a small number, 186, of respondents indicated a

contribution exceeding $2500. These responses presumably reflect family
rather than own contributions. These observations have been deleted from
our sample.

B. Family Data
For tax status the family is a more appropriate unit than the

person in the United States. Using relationship codes, ages, and marital
status we have converted the CPS data to a family basis. The incidence of
unclassifiable persons or otherwise inconsistent units was rather high. In
such cases, the observations were deleted from the sample.19

One

consequence is that use of the CPS weights is no longer appropriate.
There are two important advantages to forming a family based

sample. The first is that the employment status of husband and wife -in

two-person families can be determined. This permits unambiguous assignment
of contribution limits used to simulate policy changes.
The second advantage is that marginal tax rates can be calculated

based on the family information. Our calculations are based on U.S.
Internal Revenue Service 1984], Statistics of Income for 1982. This
source reports average adjustments and deductions by income category. The
first step is to convert each family's reported total income to adjusted

—45--

gross income by accounting for average adjustments (excluding IRAs and

Keoghs) by income class. To obtain taxable income, personal exemptions
($1000 for self, spouse if married, and each child) and the average
itemized home mortgage interest deduction (in excess of the standard

deduction if one were not to itemize) for families reporting owning a home

are subtracted from gross income. Finally, 1982 tax tables by filing
status provide the marginal tax rates assigned to each family.

These

calculated rates span the entire range from zero to fifty percent.

Notes

1.

In general, under the Canadian plan persons can contribute 20 percent

of income up to a maximum of $3500 for those with a private pension plan and
$5500 for those without a private plan.

2. This may be contrasted with portfolio composition analysis most
recently represented in the work by King and Leape [1984] or earlier work by
Feldstein [1976] for example.

3. Given current income, contributions to tax deferred accounts could
of course be taken partially or entirely from other existing asset

balances. The identification problem is to determine whether this is the
case. It is not possible to address this issue with the CF'S data, but it
will be considered in subsequent analysis based on other data sources.

4. As far as we know, a model like this one has not been estimated.
In any event, data limitations and other choices in the empirical
implementation would undoubtedly leave uncertainty about the effect of tax
deferred accounts, as well as the effect on tax-deferred contributions of

changes in the contribution limits. Answers to these questions are
important in their own right and can be answered with considerable
confidence.

5. By referring back to figure 2, one can see the difference between

these procedures. If all the data are used, then there is a concentration

-48—

of observations at zero and at L.

If the zero observations are deleted,

there is no concentration of data points at zero, but the distribution is
truncated at this point and the concentration at L remains.

The third

procedure only considers whether contributions are zero or not.

The estimates are in fact negative but not statistically different

8. Given program limits, the estimated parameters, and values of X for
each member of the sample, the expected contribution of each individual or
family is (following the notation of appendix B):

This estimate may be compared to the average IRA deduction based

10. Note this lack of information poses a problem for prediction but
not for estimation. The statistical model used to obtain parameter
estimates assigns all married persons an open-ended upper limit of
$2000 or more.

11. The implied correlation between (riY +

c)

and (rY +

is

about

-0.01.

12. It may be noticed that the sum of the individual likelihood
functions is 9490.5, whereas the likelihood value for the joint

specification is somewhat higher, 9497.8. The higher likelihood value
results from the equal variance restrictions on ri and the exclusion of

education from the contribution equation.

13. Indeed for some years the estimated effect in Canada is in fact
negative, although not statistically different from zero.

14. Strictly speaking, the simulations indicate that had the Treasury
proposal been implemented in 1982, contributions would have been 30 percent
higher than they were.

15. In principle the open intervals can be treated as closed intervals

by setting limits of -

or

.

We

treat open and closed intervals

separately for expositional purposes only.

16. To simplify matters this appendix derives likelihood functions for
a linear specification of Si and a homoscedastic error structure. The

—50--

estimated model is based on the parameter and error structure given by
equation (5) in the text.

17. In practice, this model is also estimated with a nonlinear
specification with a heteroscedastic error

structure, with equations

analagous to those in the text.

18. First consider the C = 0 case. Under the limiting case, the
probability of S greater than zero and C less than zero goes to zero
because this would be an outcome with

zero likelihood. Thus, the bivariate

distribution function drops out. The Lt1 <
can be rewritten as Pr[S >

L.J respectively. The first term in each case

goes to unity in the limiting case, since if C is greater than some positive

Lt, S must also be greater than zero. Thus in both cases the bivar-iate
distribution in the last term of likelihoods

reduces to expressions containing

only univariate cumulative distributions.

19. For example, we eliminated

persons married but living in a single

person household. Heads with the other relatives but not married were
treated as single persons.
