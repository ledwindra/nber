    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper provides insight into a corruption scheme in Kinshasa\u2019s traffic police agency. First, various data collection branches show that the agency\u2019s revenue is five times that from fines and is derived from a coalition of traffic police officials, their managers, and judicial police officers scheming to extort drivers. Second, the analysis of an experiment suggests that the scheme subverts service. Third, the scheme appears to be a rational response to the context but its logic is widespread. The findings suggest that coalitions of officials, while being socially costly, can yield large illicit revenue, challenging the notion of state weakness.\n\n",
