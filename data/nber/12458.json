    "abstract": "\n\nIn this paper, we develop a new direct measure of state anti-smoking sentiment and merge it with micro data on youth smoking in 1992 and 2000.   The empirical results from the cross-sectional models show two consistent patterns: after controlling for differences in state anti-smoking sentiment, the price of cigarettes has a weak and statistically insignificant influence on smoking participation; and state anti-smoking sentiment appears to be a potentially important influence on youth smoking participation.  The cross-sectional results are corroborated by results from discrete time hazard models of smoking initiation that include state fixed effects.  However, there is evidence of price-responsiveness in the conditional cigarette demand by youth and young adult smokers.\n\n",
