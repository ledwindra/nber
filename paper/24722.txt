Portfolio Rebalancing in General Equilibrium
Miles S. Kimball, Matthew D. Shapiro, Tyler Shumway, and Jing Zhang
NBER Working Paper No. 24722
June 2018
JEL No. D53,E44,G11
ABSTRACT
This paper develops an overlapping generations model of optimal rebalancing where agents differ
in age and risk tolerance. Equilibrium rebalancing is driven by a leverage effect that influences
levered and unlevered agents in opposite directions, an aggregate risk tolerance effect that
depends on the distribution of wealth, and an intertemporal hedging effect. After a negative
macroeconomic shock, relatively risk tolerant investors sell risky assets while more risk averse
investors buy them. Owing to interactions of leverage and changing wealth, however, all agents
have higher exposure to aggregate risk after a negative macroeconomic shock and lower exposure
after a positive shock.

Introduction

Understanding how different people trade in response to large market movements, or how
they rebalance their portfolios, is central to finance and macroeconomics. Studying rebalancing in a meaningful way requires a model that incorporates investor heterogeneity because,
if all investors are identical, then all will hold the same portfolio and there will be no trade.
We study optimal rebalancing behavior with a simple general equilibrium overlapping generations model that features heterogeneity in both age and risk tolerance. The model is
focused on asset allocation, with one risky asset in fixed supply and a risk-free asset in zero
net supply. We find that both general equilibrium and lifecycle considerations have large
effects on optimal rebalancing and thus should be inherent parts of asset allocation models. Optimal rebalancing is fairly complex, with trading driven by leverage, aggregate risk
tolerance, and intertemporal hedging effects.
Understanding the effects that drive optimal rebalancing behavior is particularly important for two reasons. First, as more empirical work is done on the rebalancing behavior of
individuals it is important to have a benchmark for equilibrium behavior in an economy in
which investors behave optimally. While our model is quite simple, it helps to provide such
a benchmark. Second, to meet the needs of investors with different horizons and preferences,
the mutual fund industry has created a number of products called “lifecycle” or “targetdate” funds that are designed to serve as the whole portfolio for a large group of investors
over their lifespans. To the extent that these funds follow simple linear rules of thumb for
allocating assets across time, their allocations will be both suboptimal and generally infea-

1

sible if universally adhered to because simple rules ignore general equilibrium constraints.
Our model helps to illustrate how “universal target-date” funds can be structured. Universal
target-date funds follow an optimal strategy over time and are feasible in general equilibrium.
Empirical work on observed rebalancing is still relatively rare. Its primary finding is that
most investors appear to display inertia in their asset allocations.1 To motivate our analysis
along these lines, we plot nonparametric estimates of stock share as a function of age from
three waves of the Survey of Consumer Finances around the recent financial crisis. The left
panel of Figure 1 depicts stock shares in the 2004 and 2007 waves, between which stock
prices rose about 30 percent. The right panel covers 2007 and 2010, between which prices
fell about 28 percent. Both plots also give the “passive” share implied by market returns
and initial shares. Average rebalancing by age is therefore given by the difference between
the passive curve and the actual curve for the second wave in each plot.2
Several interesting features are immediately apparent when looking at the plots. First,
older investors have consistently higher stock shares in these data, which may be due to
cohort effects such as those described in Malmendier and Nagel (2011). Second, there is
substantial rebalancing in the data. While many individual investors may display inertia
in their asset allocations, in aggregate investors do appear to react to market movements.
Third, most age groups do not simply revert to their initial share. Rather, older investors,
1

Calvet, Campbell and Sodini (2009) use four years of Swedish data to show that households only partially rebalance their portfolios, or they only partially reverse the passive changes in their asset allocations.
Brunnermeier and Nagel (2008) find similar results using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics.
2
The curves are estimated with simple nonparametric regressions using Epanechnikov kernels. The passive
curves are plotted assuming the stock returns reported in the text and total average non-stock returns of 6%
between 2004 and 2007 and 4% between 2007 and 2010. To be included in the sample each individual must
report at least $10,000 of financial wealth and some positive stock holding. There are 1389, 1260, and 1313
observations in 2004, 2007 and 2010, respectively.

who on average hold more stock to begin with, buy more stock than required to return to
their initial positions when the market rises. They also sell more stock than required to
return to their initial position when the market falls. Younger investors display the opposite
pattern, selling more than required to return to their initial position when prices rise, and
buying shares as markets fall. In other words, rather than the stock share by age function
either reverting back to the initial share or shifting to the passive share, it appears to pivot
in each wave. While our model will not capture every feature of these plots, it highlights the
importance of the general equilibrium constraints that the plots suggest, and it allows older
investors to behave differently than younger investors, as they appear to do in the data.
Though our model is intentionally simple, it sheds light on the counter-intuitive implications of general equilibrium. Our first set of implications is for the direction of rebalancing
in equilibrium. We show that after a negative macroeconomic (and return) shock, more risk
averse investors buy risky assets while less risk averse investors sell. After a positive shock the
opposite happens. This finding is consistent with the pivots in the plots above. Our second
3

set of implications is for portfolio shares in equilibrium. After a negative shock all investors
hold a higher risky asset share than they held before the shock. Risk tolerant investors hold
levered positions that makes their risky asset share rise when prices fall. However, falling
prices reduce their relative wealth, so aggregate risk tolerance falls and expected returns rise.
Because expected returns are higher after prices fall, agents’ desired risky asset shares after
a negative shock are higher than before the shock. Thus, while the risk tolerant investors
sell shares after a negative shock, their selling only partially offsets the increase in their risky
asset shares. Again, after a positive shock the opposite happens. Finally, we show that the
effect of intertemporal hedging is quite small in our general equilibrium setting.
Section 2 describes intuitively the three effects that drive our equilibrium outcomes: the
leverage, aggregate risk tolerance, and intertemporal hedging effects. Section 3 discusses
how our work relates to other research. In Section 4 we describe the overlapping generations
model in detail. The model has a partially closed-form solution, which makes the intuition
more transparent and substantially eases the solution of the model. Section 5 presents our
quantitative solution of the model. Section 6 presents our conclusions.

Preview

Most of the earliest models of asset allocation in general equilibrium feature homogeneous
agents, with the implication that agents will never trade or rebalance, as in Lucas (1978).
We refer to such an implication as the buy and hold rule. Other models, when considered
in partial equilibrium, imply that agents should always revert to their initial stock share, as

4

in Merton (1971). We refer to this implication as the constant share rule. Optimal portfolio
rebalancing deviates from these two very different rules for at least three reasons in our
model and more generally. First, there is a leverage effect. Since the risk-free asset is in zero
net supply in our model, there will always be some investors that hold a levered position in
the risky asset. For those with a levered position, their passive risky asset share actually
declines as the market rises, and vice versa. Levered investors need to buy when the market
rises and sell when it falls in order to keep their risky-asset shares constant, which is the
opposite of standard rebalancing advice. Second, there is an aggregate risk tolerance effect.
As the wealth of different types of agents shifts, aggregate risk tolerance also shifts, which in
turn affects equilibrium prices and expected returns. Movements in aggregate risk tolerance
induce people to trade in response to market movements in a way that does not maintain a
constant share. In our specification, the aggregate risk tolerance effect is substantial. Third,
there is an intertemporal hedging effect. Since future expected returns are time-varying,
young agents have an incentive to hedge changes in their investment opportunities when
they are middle aged. In principle, intertemporal hedging can have a significant effect on
asset demand, but for reasons we will explain, in our specification it is quite difficult to
generate enough mean reversion in asset returns to generate a substantial intertemporal
hedging effect. We discuss hedging in Section 4.
A simple example can help clarify the leverage effect. Suppose an investor wants to
maintain a levered portfolio with a share of 200% in the risky asset. With a $100 stake to
begin with, the investor borrows $100 to add to that stake and buys $200 worth of the risky

5

asset. If the risky asset suddenly doubles in value, the investor then has $400 worth of the
risky asset and an unchanged $100 of debt, for a net financial wealth of $300. The constant
share rule generally has investors sell assets when their prices rise. After this increase in
the price of the risky asset, however, the share of the investor’s net financial wealth in the
risky asset is only 400/300 = 133%, since the investor’s net financial wealth has risen even
more than the value of the risky asset. Therefore, if the goal is to maintain a 200% risky
asset share, the investor needs to borrow more to buy additional shares. Hence, levered
investors rebalance in a direction that is the opposite of unlevered investors. The general
equilibrium constraint that each buyer must trade with a seller is partially met by having
levered investors trade with unlevered investors.
The aggregate risk tolerance effect is a consequence of general equilibrium adding up.
It arises because the share of the risky asset held by an individual is a function of that
individual’s risk tolerance relative to aggregate risk tolerance; and aggregate risk tolerance
must move in general equilibrium when there are shocks that affect the distribution of wealth.
We will now show that this feature of general equilibrium makes it impossible for all investors
to maintain a constant portfolio share. Returns adjust to make people willing to adjust their
portfolio shares in a way that allows the adding-up constraint to be satisfied.
To see this, consider the aggregation of an economy characterized by individuals who
have portfolio shares determined as in Merton (1971). That is, an individual i’s share of
investable wealth Wi held in the risky asset would be

θi ≡

S
P Si
= τi ,
Wi
σ
6

(1)

where P is the price of the risky asset and Si is the amount of the risky asset. The only
heterogeneity across individuals here comes from individual risk tolerance τi and the only
heterogeneity over time comes from a time-varying expected Sharpe ratio (expected excess
return over volatility) S or from volatility σ. After aggregating this expression and imposing
adding up constraints, we can derive an expression for the risky asset share that does not
depend on the distribution of the asset’s return:

θi = τi

"
#−1
X Wi τi
i

where T =

P

i

Wi τi
W

W

(2)

is aggregate risk tolerance.3

This equation implies that neither the buy and hold rule nor the constant share rule
makes sense in general equilibrium. As prices change, wealth effects cause aggregate risk
tolerance to change. This induces rebalancing for all types of investors. This result also
appears in Dumas (1989), Wang (1996), and other papers. In our model we make precise
the exact nature of this rebalancing.

Recall that the risk free asset is in zero net supply, so the total value of all investable wealth must equal
the total value of the risky asset. Multiplying (1) through by each type’s wealth and aggregating across

Relation to the Literature

There is a great deal of research about asset allocation and portfolio choice in finance and
economics. These topics have become particularly interesting recently as economists have
begun to study household finance in detail following Campbell (2006). Three papers that
discuss optimal trading behavior are Dumas (1989), Longstaff and Wang (2012), and Wang
(1996). Dumas (1989) solves for the equilibrium wealth sharing rule in a dynamic equilibrium
model with more and less risk tolerant investors. This paper nicely illustrates the importance
of the distribution of wealth as a state variable. Longstaff and Wang (2012) discuss the
leverage effect that we describe. Like our model, these papers find that more risk tolerant
investors sell after negative market returns while less risk tolerant investors buy. All three of
these papers feature continuous time models, in which prices evolve according to Brownian
motion processes and agents trade continuously. As Longstaff and Wang (2012) explain,
more risk tolerant investors trade in a dynamic way to create long positions in call options,
while less risk tolerant investors create short call positions. As we discuss below, that paper’s
main contribution is about the size of the credit market. Dumas (1989) shows that more risk
tolerant investors would like to hold perpetual call options. Since investors are continuously
hedging to create options positions, these models generally imply infinite trading volume.
Our model differs from these by featuring lifecycle effects, discrete time, and relatively large
price movements, which will be more realistic for many investors. None of these papers
focuses on rebalancing behavior.
Two papers that show how optimal portfolio choice changes when some of the assumptions

8

of classic models are weakened are Liu (2007) and Kim and Omberg (1996). Kim and Omberg
(1996) show that optimal behavior can be quite complex when investors are not myopic,
with some investors hedging while others speculate. Liu (2007) shows that the properties of
dynamic portfolio choice models can be quite different from those of static choice models.
Relatively little of the research on portfolio choice, however, considers the general equilibrium constraints that we apply in our model. Three recent papers that feature general
equilibrium are Cochrane, Longstaff, and Santa-Clara (2008), Garleanu and Panageas (2015),
and Chan and Kogan (2002). Cochrane, Longstaff, and Santa-Clara (2008) has heterogeneous assets rather than heterogeneous agents, so it is not about trade. Garleanu and
Panageas (2015), like our paper, models investor heterogeneity in risk preference and age
in an overlapping generations model. Chan and Kogan (2002) examines the aggregate risk
tolerance effect in detail. All of these papers focus on the behavior of asset prices, showing
that general equilibrium can generate return predictability that is consistent with empirical
evidence. None of these papers explores the implications of market returns for either trading
or the portfolio choice of different types of individuals, which is the focus of our paper.
The focus of our paper is much closer to the focus of Campbell and Viceira (2002). They
find an important intertemporal hedging component of portfolio choice. In our model the
leverage effect and the time-varying aggregate risk tolerance effect are much more important.
The intertemporal hedging effect in our model is intentionally weak because we do not build
in features that might lead to hedging such as mean reversion in fundamentals or noise
traders. We have experimented with several different sets of parameter values to see if we

9

can make the intertemporal hedging effect larger in our context, but we have not been able
to find a scenario in which it matters very much. Approaches such as Campbell and Viceira
that use actual asset returns, which might reflect mispricing, have greater scope for finding
intertemporal hedging.
There is a large and important literature about labor income risk and portfolio choice, including Bodie, Merton, and Samuelson (1992), Jaganathan and Kocherlakota (1996), Cocco,
Gomes, and Maenhout (2005), and Gomes and Michaelides (2005). In a recent paper that
is related to our work, Glover, Heathcote, Krueger, and Rios-Rull (2014) find that young
people can benefit from severe recessions if old people are forced to sell assets to finance
their consumption, causing market prices to fall more than wages. We purposely abstract
from human capital considerations by assuming that agents only earn labor income before
they have an opportunity to rebalance. Our aim is thus to focus on the general equilibrium
effects while suppressing the important, but complex effects of human capital.
The leverage effect that we find is of course related to the effect discussed by Black (1976).
Geanakoplos (2010) has recently developed a model emphasizing how shocks to valuation
shift aggregate risk tolerance. Risk tolerant investors, who take highly levered risky positions,
may go bankrupt after bad shocks, thereby decreasing aggregate risk tolerance and further
depressing prices. This analysis hence features both the leverage and aggregate risk tolerance
effects. The details of his model are quite different from ours. Moreover, the focus of his
analysis is defaults, which will not occur in our setting. Nevertheless, both his model and
our model feature time varying aggregate risk tolerance driven by changes in the distribution

10

of wealth.
As mentioned in the introduction, Calvet, Campbell, and Sodini (2009) and Brunnermeier and Nagel (2008) examine portfolio rebalancing with administrative holdings data
and survey data, respectively. Both papers find that people do not completely rebalance,
or that investors do not completely reverse the passive changes in their asset allocations.
This finding is consistent with optimal rebalancing according to our model. Moreover, the
leverage effect implies that investors with high initial shares will change their allocations in
the opposite direction from that predicted by full rebalancing, or, in other words, that risk
tolerant investors will chase returns. In fact, regressions in the online appendix of Calvet,
Campbell, and Sodini (2009) indicate that the coefficients on passive changes in allocation
are increasing in initial stock share. This is exactly what we would expect to find.4
When academic researchers think about asset allocation, they generally include all risky
assets (including all types of corporate bonds) in their definition of the risky mutual fund
that all investors should hold. In our model, regardless of how one might divide assets into
safe or risky categories, we define the “risky asset” or the “tree” to be the set of all assets
in positive net supply. We define the risk-free asset to be in zero net supply. The levered
position in trees in our model encompasses both stock holdings and the risky part of the
corporate bonds.
By contrast, when practitioners think about portfolio choice they generally treat stocks,
bonds, and cash-like securities as separate asset categories in their allocation and rebalancing
4

Since Calvet, Campbell, and Sodini (2009) have detailed data on investors’ actual holdings and returns,
some portion of the returns their investors experience are idiosyncratic. This rationalizes the fact that the
coefficients in the online appendix of Calvet, Campbell, and Sodini (2009) increase in initial share but they
do not become positive for investors with high initial shares.

11

recommendations, as Canner, Mankiw, and Weil (1997) point out. To understand the size
of the leverage effect, it is important to remember that stock is a levered investment in
underlying assets. Thus, for example, if the corporate sector is financed 60% by stock and
40% by debt, an investor with more than 60% in stock is actually levered relative to the
economy as a whole. If some corporate debt can be considered essentially risk-free then it
should be possible to express such an investor’s position as a portfolio of a levered position in
the underlying assets of the economy and some borrowing at the risk-free rate. The leverage
effect will be important for all investors that hold a levered position in the underlying assets
of the economy—which is everyone who has an above-average degree of leverage (though
typically not everyone who has an above-median degree of leverage).

4

Model

We include in the model only the complications necessary to study rebalancing meaningfully.
The economy has an infinite horizon and overlapping generations. There is heterogeneity in
preferences to generate trade within generations. Specifically, there are two types of agents
with different degrees of risk tolerance. The level of risk tolerance is randomly assigned
at the beginning of the agent’s life and remains unchanged throughout life. Each agent
lives for three equal periods: young (Y ), middle-aged (M ), and old (O). Agents work in a
representative firm and receive labor income when they are young and live off their savings
when they are middle-aged and old. All agents start life with zero wealth and do not leave
assets to future generations; that is, they have no bequest motive. There is no population

12

growth, so there is always an equal mass across the three cohorts. In this section, we provide
the details of how we model and specify the technology, the asset markets, and the agents’
preferences and their resulting decision problems.

4.1

Technology and Production

Our setup has a character very similar to that of an endowment economy. There is a
fixed supply of productive assets or “trees.” Hence, we have a Lucas (1978) endowment
economy, though unlike Lucas, we will have trade because not all agents are identical, and
the endowment includes labor as well as “trees.” The young supply labor inelastically. Trees,
combined with labor, produce output that is divided into labor income and dividend income.
The labor income stream serves to provide resources to each generation. The dividend income
provides a return to risky saving. This setup allows us to provide resources to each generation
without inheritance. As noted above, by providing labor income only at the start of the life,
we intentionally abstract from the interaction of human capital with the demand for risky
assets.
The production function is Cobb-Douglas,

Yt =

1
Dt Ktα Lt1−α ,
α

(4)

where Kt is the fixed quantity of trees, Lt is labor, α is capital’s share in production, and
Dt is the stochastic level of technology. We normalize the quantity of trees Kt to be one.
The quantity of labor is also normalized to be one. Therefore, total output is Yt =
13

Dt
,
α

total

labor income is

(1−α)Dt
,
α

and total dividend income is Dt . That is, given our normalization

total dividends equal the stochastic level of technology. All labor income goes to the young,
since they are the only ones supplying labor. Dividend income will be distributed to the
middle-aged and old agents depending on their holdings of the risky tree.
In order not to build in mean reversion mechanically, we assume that the shock to dividends Gt+1 is i.i.d, so
Dt+1 = Dt Gt+1 .

(5)

In our calculations, we parameterize the dividend growth as having finite support {Gn }N
n=1 ,
where Gn occurs with probability πn each period. The dividend growth shocks are realized
at the beginning of each period before any decisions are made.

4.2

Assets

Before turning to agents’ decision problems, it is helpful to define assets and returns. In our
economy, there are two assets available to agents: one risk-free discount bond and one risky
tree security. The risk-free bond is in zero net supply, and the risky tree has a fixed supply
of one. We parameterize the dividend growth process to have two states. These two assets
provide a complete market.
One unit of a bond purchased at period t pays 1 unit of consumption in period t + 1
regardless of the state of the economy then. A bond purchased at time t has a price of 1/Rt ,
so
Rt = the gross risk-free interest rate =

(6)

One unit of the tree has a price Pt in period t and pays Dt+1 + Pt+1 if sold in period t + 1.
Thus, the gross tree return is

,

and the excess tree return is

4.3

Agents’ Decision Problems

Since this paper focuses on asset allocation, we specify preferences so that there is meaningful
heterogeneity in risk tolerance, but the consumption-saving tradeoff is simple. We use the
Epstein-Zin-Weil preferences with a unit elasticity of intertemporal substitution (Epstein
and Zin 1989, Weil 1990). The utility of agents born in date t with risk tolerance τj =

1
γj

is

given by

ρY ln(CYj t ) +

1 − ρY

ln Et exp (1 − γj )ρM ln(CM

t+1 ) + (1 − ρM ) ln Et+1 (COt+2 )
1 − γj

j
j
where CYj t , CM,t+1
and CO,t+2
denote consumption at young, middle, and old ages, and ρY

and ρM govern time preference when young and when middle-aged. The parameters ρY and
ρM will turn out to be the average propensities to consume. With an underlying discount
rate equal to δ, we have
ρY =

1
1 + δ + δ2

15

(10)

and
ρM =

1

1+δ

(11)

The degree of risk tolerance can be either high (j = H) or low (j = L). Because this utility
has a recursive form, we work backwards.
Old Agents
The problem for old agents at date t is trivial. They simply consume all of their wealth,
j
j
so total consumption of the old COt
equals the total wealth of the old WOt
. Note that

capitalized W denotes wealth per person.
Middle-aged Agents
A middle-aged agent at date t chooses consumption when middle-aged and a probability
distribution of consumption when old by choosing bond holding BM t and tree holding SM t
to maximize intertemporal utility

Consider the portfolio allocation of this middle-aged agent where θ is the share of savings

Given the homotheticity of preferences and the absence of labor income after youth, the

(28)

Comparing the middle-aged portfolio problem in (16) with the young portfolio problem
in (28), we find that the young solve a more complicated problem given their longer life
span. Middle-aged agents with only one more period of life simply maximize the certainty
equivalent return of their portfolio investment next period, as in equation (16). Young agents
with two more periods to live need to pay attention to the covariance between portfolio
returns from youth to middle-age and the certainty equivalent of the returns going forward
beyond middle age.
Value of a Universal Target-Date Fund as Numeraire
Since future expected returns are time-varying, the multi-period decision problem of the
young creates an opportunity for intertemporal hedging (Merton 1973). To sharpen the
interpretation of intertemporal hedging, define

QjM,t+1 =

1
ρρMM (1

−

ρM )1−ρM (φjM,t+1)1−ρM

,

(29)

which prices the variable annuity or “universal target date fund” for a given age and risk
aversion. It yields, at lowest cost, a lifetime utility equal to the lifetime utility from one
unit of consumption at period t + 1 and one unit of consumption at period t + 2. That is,
the agent will be indifferent between being limited to consuming one unit of consumption

20

at both middle and old age and having wealth of QjM,t+1 to deploy optimally.5 The sense in
which the universal target date fund is “universal” is that it remains the optimal thing to do
even if everyone else has a universal target date fund in equilibrium. Given this definition
of the universal target date fund, equation (28) can be rewritten as follows:

φjY t

(30)

Thus, a young agent maximizes the simple certainty equivalent of his or her portfolio’s return
relative to the return on the universal target date fund. In other words, this universal target
date fund paying out in periods t + 1 and t + 2 serves as a numeraire for returns from t to
t + 1.6
5

To see this, note that by (12), consumption of one at both middle and old age yields a lifetime utility of
zero for the middle-aged agent. Unit middle-aged holdings of QM,t+1 must therefore make the middle-aged
lifetime utility given by (17) equal to zero once the optimal consumption and portfolio share are substituted
in, so
ρM ln(ρM QjM,t+1 ) + (1 − ρM ) ln((1 − ρM )QjM,t+1 ) + (1 − ρM ) ln(φjM,t+1 ) = 0.
The value of QjM,t+1 given in (29) is the solution to this equation. The universal target date fund itself
implicitly replicates the optimal portfolio strategy for the agent.
6
Note that, because of its definition as the amount of wealth yielding lifetime utility equal to the lifetime
utility from consumption constant at one, equation (20) can be rewritten
j
j
j
j
VM
t (WM t ) = ln(WM t ) − ln(QM t ).

Defining the corresponding price of the universal target date fund in youth that can give lifetime utility
equivalent to the lifetime utility of one unit of consumption in each of the three periods of life, [QjY t ]−1 =
ρρYY (1 −ρY )1−ρY [ρρMM (1 −ρM )1−ρM ]1−ρY (φjY t )1−ρY , the maximized utility for a young agent that results from
substituting in the optimal decisions can be similarly written as
VYj t (WYj t ) = ln(WYj t ) − ln(QjY t ).
Thus, the price of the universal target-date fund fully captures the dependence of the value function on the
investment opportunity set. Note that, unless γ = 1, wealth and Q are no longer additively separable after
the application of the appropriate curvature for risk preferences.

Market Clearing

In our economy, the safe discount bonds are in zero net supply, and the risky tree has an
inelastic supply normalized to one. We now substitute the asset demands we derived in the
previous subsection into the asset market clearing conditions. Recall that the individual-level
risky tree (S) and safe bond (B) demands of the young are given by SYj t = (1−ρY )WYj t θYj t/Pt
and BYj t = (1 − ρY )WYj t Rt (1 − θYj t). The asset demands of the middle-aged are given by
j
j
j
j
j
j
SM
t = (1 − ρM )WM t θM t /Pt and BM t = (1 − ρM )WM t (1 − θM t )Rt . The old have no asset

demand. Summing over the type j and the generations, the asset market clearing conditions
can be written as

(32)

where
ψj = the constant fraction of agents of type j.
Note that Rt is determined implicitly in equation (32) because the θ are functions of Rt .
In addition to the asset market clearing conditions, the goods market clearing condition
is also instructive. It is

ρY (1 − α)Dt
Dt
H
L
=
+ ρM (ψH WM
t + ψL WM t ) + WOt ,
α
α
22

(33)

where the wealth level of the old WOt is given by the sum across the two types. Note that
the propensity to consume out of wealth is 1 for the old, so there is no parameter multiplying
WOt . Since the asset demands for old agents are equal to zero regardless of the level of risk
aversion, we do not need to keep track separately of the wealth of each old group.
The total financial wealth of the economy is the sum of the value of the tree Pt and the
dividend Dt , since the risk-free asset is in zero net supply. At the beginning of the period
all financial wealth is held by the middle-aged and the old. Hence, the total wealth of the
old is
H
L
WOt = Pt + Dt − ψH WM
t − ψL WM t .

(34)

Substituting this expression into equation (33) and solving for Pt gives rise to an equation
for Pt based only on contemporaneous variables:

Pt = (1 − ρY )

1−α
H
L
Dt + (1 − ρM )(ψH WM
t + ψL WM t ).
α

(35)

The right-hand side of (35) can be interpreted simply as the sum of savings supplies, and
therefore total asset demands, of the young and middle aged, determined by their propensities
to save and initial levels of wealth.
Normalizing all the variables in the above equation by dividend Dt gives the expression
for the price-dividend ratio pt ,

pt = (1 − ρY )

1−α
H
L
+ (1 − ρM )(ψH wM
t + ψL wM t ),
α

23

(36)

where lower case letters denote the corresponding variables divided by the dividend Dt .
Thus, the price-dividend ratio pt is linear in the total (per-dividend) middle-aged wealth
H
L
ψ H wM
t + ψLwM t . The first term on the right-hand side of (36) corresponds to the demand

for saving of the young, which is a constant share of dividends and is therefore a constant
in the per-dividend expression.
Having an analytic expression for the price-dividend ratio both adds transparency to our
analysis and simplifies the solution of the model. Analytic expressions for portfolio shares
and expected returns for the risky and risk-free assets are not available. In Section 5, we
will turn to numerical solutions of the model. Unlike the price-dividend ratio, which only
depends on total middle-aged wealth, portfolio shares and expected returns will depend on
the distribution of wealth among the middle-aged agents. This distribution depends on the
history of shocks. For example, as we will discuss explicitly in Section 5, a good dividend
growth shock raises the share of wealth held by the middle-aged risk-tolerant agents who
invested heavily in the risky asset when young. This increased wealth share of the risktolerant agents in turn affects asset demands and expected returns.

4.5
4.5.1

Equilibrium Solution
State Variables

Consider the state variable vector at the moment prices are determined. At that moment,
the wealth of each group of agents is known. Because all preferences are recursive, nothing
from the past directly enters into the preferences induced over actions now and in the fu-

24

ture. The sum of human wealth and non-human wealth for each agent, together with the
stochastic process for returns from that moment on fully determines what actions maximize
an agent’s utility. Each agent’s decision problem has a perfect scale symmetry because of the
homotheticity of preferences together with linear budget constraints. This scale symmetry
aggregates perfectly. Thus, only wealth relative to Dt matters for behavior. Furthermore,
the scale symmetry means that behavior can be smoothly aggregated across agents within
a type, so that, in effect, there is a representative agent of each type. Thus, despite the
complexity of the agents’ asset allocation choices (particularly the choices of the young, who
have to worry about intertemporal hedging), the set of possible equilibria is determined entirely by forward-looking considerations. These decisions are conditioned on the wealth of
each type at that moment when prices and therefore pre-consumption wealth are known.
These considerations indicate that the dynamic stochastic equilibrium from any point on
only needs to be a function of the vector of normalized wealth levels for each type of agent.
(Recall that the normalization is dividing through by the dividend, D.) What is less obvious
is that, once all old agents are considered as belonging to one type, since their risk aversion
no longer matters for their behavior, the vector of possible normalized wealth levels spans
only a two-dimensional space. For convenience, represent a point on this two-dimensional
space by the normalized wealth of the daring and cautious middle-aged agents. By (36), the
sum of middle-aged wealth, together with the constant value of the wealth of the young in
relation to the dividend determines the price of the tree and hence the value of all wealth. Of
the nonhuman wealth owned at the beginning of the period, everything not in the hands of

25

middle-aged agents must be in the hands of the old, since the absence of inheritance means
that the young begin their first period of economic life with zero nonhuman wealth. Thus,
the wealth of the old can be deduced from the wealth of the two middle-aged types. And as
mentioned already, the normalized human wealth of the young is constant at

1−α
.
α

So we can

take the state variable vector to be the two-dimensional vector of normalized wealth levels
of the middle-aged types where wealth is measured prior to consumption.
Because the forward-looking behavior of each type (other than the old, who are simple)
makes the dynamic stochastic general equilibrium complex, it is not possible to give a closedform expression for the Markov transition from one period to the next. But again, since each
representative agent’s range of behavior only depends on that type’s wealth and forwardlooking expectations for returns given different possible states of the economy, no lagged
variable needs to enter into the determination of the equilibrium. Taking as given the
outcome of the complex decision problem of agents in one period (including the complexity
of needing to figure out the entire forward-looking dynamic stochastic general equilibrium),
it is possible to give a closed form solution for the price of the tree in the next period. We
discuss this in the next subsection.

4.5.2

Markov Representation

To show that our model is Markov, we make two points. First, the optimal portfolios are
entirely forward-looking. Individual agents only care about the intertemporal probabilistic
pattern of returns over their lifetime. The expected return distribution is entirely determined
by the state vector of the aggregate normalized wealth levels of the two types of middle-aged
26

agents. Second, given the forward-looking portfolio behavior of agents, what happens in the
next period is fully determined.
Once agents have made their decisions at time t, the key facts that go forward to the next
period are the assets owned by the daring and cautious middle-aged agents (j = {L, H}).
The middle-aged wealth next period is given by the portfolio choice of the young in the
current period, prices and returns next period. Specifically, consider a young household of
type j = {H, L} with savings of (1−ρY ) 1−α
. By investing optimally a share θYj t of her savings
α
in the risky asset, her wealth at the beginning of the next period (turning middle-aged) after
the dividend growth rate shock is given by

In the square brackets of the right-hand side, the first term is the return on the part of
savings in bonds and the second term is the return on the part of savings in the tree. The
total returns from both bonds and tree imply their wealth when middle-aged.
To derive the law of motion of wealth, we use equation (36) to eliminate the future price

We now present a complete characterization of the solution (see Section 4.5.3 and Appendix A.1) and demonstrate that there exists a stationary Markov equilibrium of the model
(see Section 4.5.4 and Appendix A.2). We discuss the computation of the equilibrium in Appendix A.3.
The proof of the existence of the equilibrium follows directly from applying the results
of Duffie, Geanokoplos, Mas-Collel, and McLennan (1994a) including an unpublished proof
graciously supplied by Andrew McLennan (Duffie, Geanokoplos, Mas-Collel, and McLennan,
1994b). Appendix A.2 extends that proof by showing that it applies to our three-period
model rather than their two-period model and that its logic applies to the Epstein-Zinn
preferences that we assume.

4.5.3

Definition of Equilibrium

The model and its solution in the paper are stated in terms of variables indexed by time, notation which is natural for the analysis of shocks that lead to rebalancing. In this section, we
turn to a proof of the existence of the stationary Markov equilibrium. Since the equilibrium
is in terms of the time invariant functions, we use bold to denote the equilibrium functions
associated with these variables. Consistent with the notation tradition of the literature on
Markov equilibria, the prime (0) denotes the next period variables or functions.
We review the relevant notation. The idiosyncratic dividend growth rate shock G has
a finite support {Gn }N
n=1 with probability πn for each Gn . The middle-aged post-shock
L
H
wealth w = (wM
, wM
) is the state variable of the economy. We will use lower-case letters of

variables to indicate the values of the variables divided by same-dated dividends: x = X/D.
ρY and ρM denote the marginal propensities to consume for the young and the middle aged,
respectively. ψj denotes the constant fraction of agents of type j in each cohort. γj is the
risk aversion parameter of type j. α denotes the capital share, so the labor income of the
young is wYj = wY =

1−α
α

for both j = H, L.

We first define the recursive equilibrium by collecting the equations that fully characterize
the equilibrium, and then discuss these equations in more detail. Equation numbers in
the square brackets cross-reference the equations for the variables. (Note that the crossreferenced equations are not normalized by dividends [capital letters instead of lower case
letters].) We denote the equations defining the stationary Markov equilibrium in terms of
functions as SM.1, SM.2, etc. to distinguish them from the equations elsewhere in the text,

29

which are expressed in terms of variables.
The recursive equilibrium consists of price functions {p(w), R(w), Z(w, G0 )}, allocations

Existence of Equilibrium

PROPOSITION. There exists a recursive equilibrium that satisfies equations (SM.1)(SM.11).

31

Proof. See Appendix A.2.
Duffie, Geanokoplos, Mas-Colell, and McLennan (1994) have a result (Proposition 1.2)
under quite general conditions that if an equilibrium always exists for any finite-horizon, then
an ergodic Markov equilibrium also exists in the infinite horizon. The proof in Appendix
A.2 shows that their general proof applies to our specific setting.

Alternative State Variable Representation

characterize the state of the model economy at any point in time. In terms of our model,
aggregate risk tolerance is

alternative to the equivalent description of the state by (wM

7

Note that the relevant wealth for this aggregation in our model is savings or invested wealth, i.e., wealth
after consumption. In the continuous-time Merton model, there is no consumption during the investment
period, so the distinction between before- and after-consumption wealth is absent.

Recall (36) and rewrite (40) as
Tt =

Quantitative Results

In this section, we examine numerical solutions of a particular parameterization of our model
focusing on the optimal portfolio allocations and rebalancing behavior of households in general equilibrium. Portfolios vary across agents with different levels of risk tolerance. In
particular, the optimal portfolio share is larger than the market portfolio share (100%) for
the high-risk-tolerance agents and lower than the market portfolio share for the low-risktolerance agents. The portfolio tree shares of all types comove in response to the dividend
growth rate shock: declining after a good shock and rising after a bad shock. The underlying
wealth dynamics ensure that such comovements in the portfolio shares are consistent with
general equilibrium.

5.1

Parameterization and Solution

Table 1 summarizes the parameter values used in the quantitative analysis. A model period
corresponds to 20 years in the data. The 20-year discount rate of 0.67 corresponds to an
annual discount rate of 0.98. Consequently, ρM is 0.75 and ρY is 0.69. Capital’s share
is 0.33. The cross-sectional heterogeneity in risk tolerance is set to match the findings in
Kimball, Sahm, and Shapiro (2008). They estimate the mean risk tolerance to be 0.21 and
the standard deviation to be 0.17. The distribution they estimate has skewness of 1.84. We
match these three moments by giving 92% of agents a low risk tolerance τL of 0.156 and
33

8% of agents a high risk tolerance τH of 0.797. We refer to the low-risk-tolerance agents as
cautious agents and the high-risk-tolerance agents as daring agents.
The dividend growth shock process is assumed to be i.i.d with two states of equal prob1.005 20
) and in
ability. In the bad state, the detrended gross growth rate is G1 = 0.67 ≈ ( 1.025
1.045 20
the good state, it is G2 = 1.5 ≈ ( 1.025
) . With our 20-year time horizon, these parameters

imply that the dividend growth rate is 2.5% per year in expected terms, 0.5% per year in
the bad state and 4.5% per year in the good state. The dividend growth rate shocks capture
generational risk. The mean scenario mimics the experience of the United States, the good
scenario mimics that of South Korea, and the bad scenario mimics that of the Japan in the
last two decades. Since all key variables below are expressed on a per-dividend basis and the
elasticity of intertemporal substitution is equal to 1, the trend growth rate of 2.5% per year
does not affect any of our analysis.

t , wM t ). We are able to omit states

governing the dividend growth rate from the state space due to the i.i.d. assumption. We
discretize the state space in our numerical solution, but we allow the decision variables to
be continuous. We use the recursive dynamic technique to solve the model. For the detailed
computational algorithm see Appendix A.
We now present the quantitative behavior of our model economy, focusing particularly
on asset holdings. Our findings on price and return dynamics are not the main contribution
of this paper, so we discuss them in Appendix B.

5.2

The Dynamics of Risk Tolerance

Understanding the endogenous wealth dynamics across agents is central to understanding the
dynamics of asset holdings. The history of shocks matters because it affects the distribution
of wealth and therefore aggregate risk tolerance. We define aggregate risk tolerance in
Equation (40). We display impulse response functions, starting from the average steady state
and then show the average response of the economy after a good or bad shock in period 1.
Figure 2 shows how aggregate risk tolerance responds to both positive and negative shocks.
The plot is symmetric because it gives deviations from the mean and good shocks and bad
shocks are equally likely.

The impulse response shown in Figure 2 shows aggregate risk tolerance rises as a result
of a good shock and falls as a result of a bad shock. While the long-run average aggregate
risk tolerance is about 0.227, it falls to 0.202 after a bad shock and rises to 0.25 after a good
shock. This is because a good shock corresponds to a positive return and an increase in the
wealth of daring agents. The shock in period 1 matters less for risk tolerance in period 2
because one of the affected cohorts dies, and another affected cohort reaches the simplicity
of old age. Yet on average the period 1 movement in risk tolerance rebounds so that it is
more than reversed in period 2.
What explains the dependence of aggregate risk tolerance in period 2 on the shock in
period 1? A good shock at time 1 puts a large share of invested wealth in the hands of daring
middle-aged agents, who then hold a large fraction of all available shares of the risky asset,
leaving less for their more cautious peers and for the young cohort as a whole. Thus, the
overall holdings of the young cohort are less aggressive when they enter economic life on the
36

heels of a good dividend-growth-rate shock than when they enter economic life on the heels
of a bad dividend-growth-rate shock. This is particularly relevant for daring young agents,
as it means that the fraction of all invested wealth in middle age that they hold is less than
it would otherwise be. Thus, after a good shock in period 1 the wealth of daring middle aged
agents in period 2 is unusually low, and therefore the aggregate risk tolerance in that state
of the world is also unusually low. This explanation is symmetric, so that after a bad shock
in period 1 risk tolerance is unusually high in period 2. Similar reasoning can explain how
shocks affect risk tolerance in later periods. In principle each shock affects all future values
of aggregate risk tolerance, but in practice the effect of any shock tends to average out after
3 periods.
Figures 3 plots the impulse responses for wealth shares after bad and good shocks and
Figure 4 shows how the aggregate wealth shares of different types of agents sum to one.
Consistent with the rest of our results, the wealth share of the middle aged daring goes
down after a bad shock and up after a good shock. The wealth share of the middle aged
cautious shows the opposite pattern, and the wealth share of the young does not vary much
with shocks.

5.3

Portfolio Choice and Rebalancing

Most modern discussions of asset pricing in general equilibrium focus on the properties of
asset prices and returns. Asset holdings are left implicit. Since we are particularly concerned
with implications for individual asset demands, we look directly at portfolio choice and

Like the impulse response plot of aggregate risk tolerance in Figure 2, the period 0 value
in these plots is the long-run mean tree holding for each group. Also like Figure 2, these
figures are symmetric in the shock, in that the impulse response for positive shocks is the
opposite relative to that mean of the impulse response for the negative shocks. Both figures
show that tree holdings respond substantially to good and bad shocks. After a bad shock,
the tree holdings of the young agents of both types increase. The holdings of daring middle
aged investors fall substantially while those of cautious middle-aged investors rise. After a
good shock the holdings of daring middle-aged investors rise substantially and those of the

other types fall. By period 2 these effects are largely reversed.
The effects in Figures 5 and 6 are driven by the same type of logic used to explain
aggregate risk tolerance above. After a bad shock the wealth of middle-aged daring investors
has declined substantially and they hold less of the risky asset. Because the risky asset is
relatively cheap, other investor types (young daring, young cautious, middle-aged cautious)
are happy to hold more. The middle-aged cautious investors are rebalancing in the direction
(but not the exact extent) a constant share rule would imply. The logic after a good shock
is the reverse.
The findings of these figures are developed further in Table 2. The first three columns
of Table 2 report the portfolio share of each type of agent. The statistics in the table help
us to isolate three important effects: leverage, aggregate risk tolerance, and intertemporal
hedging.

40

First, leverage arises endogenously, with the daring agents being highly levered and with
the cautious agents holding a risky, but unlevered portfolio. As shown in the first column
of Table 2, the cautious agents hold only about 48% of their savings (invested wealth) in
the risky asset and the rest in the risk-free bonds. By contrast, the daring agents invest on
average 568% of their invested wealth in the risky asset by selling the risk-free bonds to the
cautious agents. This difference in portfolio shares across types enables shocks to change the
distribution of wealth across types.

Note: The portfolio share is the ratio of risky assets and savings of each type, the savings weight is the
fraction of each type’s savings in total savings, and the tree amount is the amount of tree held by each type.
In particular, the tree amount equals the savings weight times the portfolio share for each type. Both the
tree amount and the savings weight should sum up to 100 percent across types. Savings is after-consumption
wealth. Gt denotes the dividend growth rate shock in period t.

Second, as the second and third columns of Table 2 show, one of the most striking
implications of the model is that all types have a higher mean portfolio tree share after
a bad shock than after a good shock due to the aggregate risk tolerance effect. A bad
shock pushes down aggregate risk tolerance and raises the expected excess return. As a
result, all types of agents choose a larger portfolio share. After a good shock, aggregate risk
41

tolerance rises, the expected excess return declines, and all agents decrease their portfolio
shares. It may seem surprising that all agents are able to move their portfolio shares in the
same direction in general equilibrium. Section 5.5 below shows that changes in the wealth
distribution combined with the effects of leverage, in particular, changes in the share of all
invested wealth in the hands of middle-aged daring agents, allow all portfolio shares to move
in the same direction.
Third, Table 2 indicates that for each level of risk tolerance the portfolio share of the
young is similar to that of the middle-aged. Recall that we abstract from the dynamic
interaction between human capital and portfolio choice by having labor income only at
the beginning of the life. The comparison between young and middle-aged portfolios for
a given level of risk tolerance thus isolates the pure intertemporal hedging effect. Table 2
indicates that the intertemporal hedging effect is small quantitatively. Qualitatively, the
cautious young have a lower portfolio share than the cautious middle-aged, while the daring
young have a higher portfolio share than the daring middle-aged. Section 5.7 discusses these
implications in detail.9
The average young portfolio share has important implications for the dynamics of the
total middle-aged wealth and aggregate risk tolerance next period. Recall that the cautious
agents account for 92% of the population and the daring agents account for the other 8%.
The average young portfolio share is 105% (= 0.92 × 53 + 0.08 × 704) after a bad shock
and 74% (= 0.92 × 43 + 0.08 × 433) after a good shock. Thus, the young hold a slightly
9

Our results do not appear to be special to the parameterization that we have assumed. In Appendix C
we both halve and double the variation in risk tolerance and the magnitude of economic shocks. The results
we obtain are qualitatively the same.

42

more daring portfolio (105%) than the market portfolio (100%) after a good shock, but a
much more conservative portfolio (74%) after a bad shock. These patterns for the portfolio
share of the young contribute to the history dependence of aggregate risk tolerance that we
discussed in the previous subsection.

5.4

Prices and Returns

In this section we describe the prices and returns implied by the model in order to make the
intuition behind our rebalancing results clear. Table 3 presents the summary statistics based
on a model simulation of 10,000 periods, which is a sufficiently long sample to eliminate the
simulation uncertainty. Returns are expressed as annual rates. The log risk free rate has a
mean of 1.9% and a standard deviation of 22 basis points. The log realized tree return is
on average 3.63% with a standard deviation of 2%. Thus, the model economy generates a
1.7% risk premium with a standard deviation of 2%, resulting in an average Sharpe Ratio of
0.85. Although our model is not specifically designed to deliver a large risk premium, it goes
a substantial fraction of the way toward explaining the historical premium. The model’s
Sharpe Ratio is quite high because the return volatility implied by the model is low. This
results from our choice to match the volatility of macroeconomic shocks rather than market
shocks.
Similarly, the model’s expected returns and price-dividend ratio are much less volatile
than in historical data. For instance, the price-dividend ratio is on average 19, with a
standard deviation of 0.54. Because shocks to the fundamentals are i.i.d. in the growth

rate, movements in the realized return on the risky asset move essentially one-for-one with
the dividend shock. Moreover, the i.i.d. growth shock means that any forecastability of
returns comes from general equilibrium effects, not from the fundamentals per se. It turns
out that these general equilibrium effects have a contribution to returns that is relatively
small compared to sheer good and bad luck, so there is relatively little serial correlation in
the realized risky return and the risk-free rate.
The expected excess return is critical for portfolio choice. It is strongly negatively correlated with the dividend growth rate shock and is somewhat mean reverting. Mechanically,
these results are coming from movements in the risk-free rate, which is highly correlated with
the shock to the dividend growth rate. Intuitively, the risk-free rate is moving because the
shock to dividends changes the wealth of daring agents and therefore shifts the aggregate risk
tolerance. We discuss the dynamics of the price dividend ratio in more detail in Appendix
B.
We plot the Sharpe ratio of the risky asset in Figure 7. Consistent with the findings in
Table 3, the Sharpe ratio increases after a bad shock and decreases after a good shock.

Correlated Movements in Portfolio Shares

It may seem surprising that all types of agents move their portfolios in the same direction in
a general equilibrium. The key forces behind this finding are the changes in the total wealth

To understand the implications of this constraint, look first at the “savings weights,” the
weights for invested wealth or after-consumption wealth

,

reported in the middle columns

of Table 2. The cautious agents have a larger savings weight than the daring because the
cautious have a larger mass. The savings weight of the cautious is, however, lower after a good
shock (85%) than after a bad shock (92.8%), so the aggregate risk tolerance increases after a

45

good shock. Both the daring and cautious young agents have a slightly larger savings weight
after a good shock than after a bad shock. The cautious middle-aged have a much smaller
savings weight after a good shock (23.3%) than after a bad shock (32.7%). In contrast, the
daring middle-aged have a much larger savings weight after a good shock (9.6%) than after
a bad shock (2%).
Now, examine the quantity of trees held by each type of agent in the last two columns of
Table 2. The quantity of trees held by each type equals that type’s portfolio share multiplied
by the savings weight of each type. Even though the economy has relatively fewer daring
agents, the tree holdings of the daring agents are comparable in total size to those of the
cautious agents due to their heavily levered position. After a good shock, the young agents
have slightly higher savings weights but much lower portfolio shares, leading to much lower
total tree holdings. After a good shock, the middle-aged cautious agents have a much lower
savings weight and thus an even lower quantity of tree holdings given their decreased portfolio
share. On the other hand, the middle-aged daring agents have a much higher savings weight
after a good shock, almost four times higher. The increase in their savings weight dominates
the decline in their portfolio share, implying a larger total quantity of tree holdings by the
middle-aged daring agents.
This effect can be illustrated with the impulse response plot in Figure 8. This figure plots
the reaction of each investor type to bad and good shocks by comparing their portfolio shares
to their long-run mean portfolio shares. The shares of the young daring and middle-aged
daring are so similar that the lines are very difficult to distinguish in the plot. The figure

46

clearly shows that after a good shock, all portfolio shares drop. After a bad shock they rise.

In our parameterization all types of agents in the economy adjust their portfolio shares
in the same direction in response to the dividend growth shocks. In particular, all increase
their portfolio shares after a bad shock and decrease them after a good shock. This is also
true for the all of the dramatically different alternative parameterizations that we consider
in Appendix C, in which we double and halve the size of the shock and double and halve
the distribution of risk tolerance. It may be possible, however, to find counterexamples.
Although it need not always be that everyone’s shares move in the same direction, we
consider this the natural case since the expected return is the main determinant of the
optimal shares for people to hold. While intertemporal hedging also matters in determining
optimal holdings, the variation in the expected return is much larger than the variation in
47

hedging so its effect dominates. We discuss the magnitude of hedging effects below.
Even though all agents move their portfolio shares in the same direction, some must sell
while others buy in order to attain their new positions. The changes in the underlying wealth
distribution make such portfolio behavior consistent with general equilibrium.

5.6

Rebalancing by Cohort

So far we have been focusing on the portfolio dynamics of each type of agent at a point
in time. Now we track the portfolio rebalancing of each cohort over time. When young,
the agents choose an optimal portfolio share after the dividend shock. At the beginning of
middle age, before any rebalancing, the value of their tree holdings as a share of their middleaged wealth changes passively in response to the realized dividend shock and the realized
tree return. We refer to this portfolio share as the realized portfolio share.10 The agents
then choose the optimal portfolio share for their middle age (governing wealth accumulation
between then and old age). We present the sequence of the three portfolio shares in Table 4.
Because we are tracking cohorts (or individuals), we group equilibrium observations by the
history of shocks rather than reporting an impulse response as we have done previously. GY
and GM denote the shocks that the agents experience when young and when middle-aged,
respectively.
Let’s first examine the passive movements of the portfolio share of each cohort. Since
the cautious young agents are not levered, the realized middle-age portfolio share rises sub10

This realized portfolio share implicitly assumes that consumption is financed by asset sales in proportion
to asset shares, including proportionate paying off of debt for agents who have negative bond holdings.

stantially after a good shock at their middle age, and declines slightly after a bad shock. By
contrast, since the daring young agents are highly levered, their realized middle-age portfolio
share rises after a bad shock, but declines after a good shock. In addition, the magnitude of
the changes in their portfolio share is quite large. For instance, the realized portfolio share
rises from 706% to 988% after a history of two bad shocks, and declines from 706% to 166%
after a bad shock when young followed by a good shock at middle age.
If the constant share rule were more or less correct, the agents would undo the movements
in the realized middle-aged portfolio shares and return to the portfolio share when young. In
terms of the direction of the adjustment at middle age, the constant share rule is consistent
with the behavior of the cautious agents. The cautious agents do not, however, return to the
same portfolio share when young. In fact, the new optimal level is typically quite different
from the optimal share when young. The difference in the optimal shares between the two
periods is particularly large when the shock they experience when young is different from
the shock at middle age.
In addition to the quantitative differences, there are two types of qualitative differences
between the optimal rebalancing shown in Table 4 and the constant share rule. First, even

49

returning to the same tree share requires opposite adjustments for people who seek to be more
levered than the economy as a whole as compared to agents who seek to be less levered than
the economy as a whole. Second, for the daring agents, the direction of their adjustments
at middle age is sometimes opposite to the direction that would restore their tree share to
what they had earlier. In particular, after a bad shock when young followed by a good shock
at middle age, the daring middle-aged agents further increase their portfolio share above the
realized portfolio share.

5.7

Intertemporal Hedging

Intertemporal hedging in our model arises when the portfolio shares shift consistently by
age to take into account any predictability in returns. Referring back to Table 2, there is
little difference in the portfolio choice between the young and the middle-aged. Given that
our generational model produces only limited predictability in returns, it is not surprising
that we see little intertemporal hedging. On the other hand, the qualitative implications of
intertemporal hedging are still interesting and deserve some discussion.
To understand these patterns of intertemporal hedging, recall the portfolio choice problem
of the young in equation (28) and of the middle-aged in equation (16). Unlike the middleaged, who care about simple real returns, the young care about returns relative to the returns
of the variable annuity, as indicated by (30). Table 5 presents the annuity price conditional
on the current and past shocks.
For the cautious agents, the variable annuity price is higher after a bad shock than after

a good shock. The combination of a low risk-free rate and lower expected tree returns late
in life after a bad shock makes it harder to finance a comfortable retirement (see Table 3).
This unfavorable movement in the variable annuity price after a bad shock increases the
effective risk of holding tree shares when young. By contrast, this variable annuity price
is irrelevant for the middle-aged cautious agents; they care only about one-period returns.
Thus, the young cautious agents invest less in the tree than the middle-aged cautious agents.
The annuity price variation in period t is larger when the dividend shock is good in period
t − 1. Thus, this finding is reinforced when the cautious agents experienced a good shock
when young.
For the daring agents, however, the variable annuity price is lower after a bad shock than
after a good shock, since they tend to be so highly levered that the increase in the equity
premium after a bad shock makes it easier for them to finance a comfortable retirement. This
variable annuity price pattern helps the daring agents smooth consumption at their middle
age, and thus the young daring agents invest more in the risky asset than the middle-aged
daring agents. The variation in the period-t annuity price is larger when the dividend shock
is bad (which yields a greater covariance of the equity premium with the later shock) than
when the dividend growth shock is good. Thus, quantitatively, the young daring agents invest

51

more in risky assets than the middle-aged daring agents, especially when they experience a
bad shock in their youth.

Conclusion

We develop a model to illustrate how optimizing agents of different ages and risk preferences
rebalance in equilibrium. The dynamics of portfolios differ starkly from benchmark models
where agents either hold constant portfolio shares or buy and hold the market portfolio. The
model includes agents with different risk tolerance, so there is meaningful trade, and three
periods of life, so there is meaningful rebalancing over time. The model has a partial analytic
solution. In particular, the state of the economy can be summarized by the distribution of
wealth of middle-aged investors. This analytic solution both helps make the findings of the
paper transparent and simplifies the solution of the full dynamic equilibrium model.
There are several effects that are key to understanding rebalancing in equilibrium. First,
there is a leverage effect. In the model, leverage arises endogenously because of the heterogeneity in risk preferences. Shocks to the valuation of risky assets cause levered agents
to rebalance in the opposite direction from unlevered agents. Second, there is an aggregate
risk tolerance effect. Shocks to the valuation of risky assets affect agents’ wealth differently
depending on their initial position in the risky asset. Such shifts in the distribution of wealth
change aggregate risk tolerance and therefore the demand for assets going forward. Note
that the leverage and aggregate risk tolerance effects are connected because leverage magnifies how valuation shocks change the distribution of wealth. For example, after a bad shock

52

leverage increases. The levered agents sell to reduce their leverage and the unlevered agents
buy. But the increase in leverage is so great that even after rebalancing levered agents have
higher exposure to risky assets. Therefore, all agents become more exposed to risk after a
bad shock, and the opposite is true after a good shock
Third, there is an intertemporal hedging effect whereby equilibrium time variation in expected returns affects the portfolio choices of young investors as they exploit mean reversion
in asset returns. This intertemporal hedging effect arising from mean reversion is what is
often highlighted in analyses emphasizing time- or age-variation in portfolio shares. While
it is present in our model, it is quantitatively weak by design. The model is solved under
a specification with i.i.d. growth rates, so mean reversion in returns is not built into the
specification. Other analyses of intertemporal hedging in the literature are based on empirical properties of actual returns, which might include mean reversion arising from mispricing.
Our model has all agents frictionlessly optimizing, hence many sources of mean reversion that
may be present in the data are intentionally not present in the model in order to highlight
the implications of equilibrium for rebalancing.
Some key implications of the model are broadly consistent with recent rebalancing experience by age in data from the Survey of Consumer Finances. Determining the implications
of our model for standard rebalancing data requires some thought. Our model features the
underlying fundamentals: one risky asset and risk-free borrowing and lending. Data from
markets feature stocks, bonds and other types of risky assets. Of course, these financial
assets are claims on the fundamentals that also depend on the corporate capital structure.

53

In particular, leverage in the corporate sector has important implications for the risk exposure of stockholders. For example, consider an investor with 100 percent stocks when the
capital structure in the economy is half equity and half debt. In terms of our model, that
investor will have a risky asset share of two. Because of the leverage effect described in the
model, as stock prices rise a 100 percent stock investor will have a lower risky tree share
before rebalancing because her wealth grows faster than the value of her equity. What is
going on is that when the value of all capital in the economy increases, stocks become less
levered relative to the economy as a whole. Thus, to maintain the same leverage relative to
the economy as a whole, an investor who began with 100 percent in stocks would need to
buy more stocks after this market uptick. However, a finding of the paper is that because
of general equilibrium forces, an investor will not rebalance to the same tree share as before
the market uptick, but to a somewhat lower tree share, tempering somewhat the need to
buy more stock. This example highlights how intuition about portfolios in terms of stocks
must be interpreted with caution because of the underlying leverage of the corporate sector.
Looking back at the implied rebalancing from Survey of Consumer Finances data reported in Figure 1, several features of the recent history are consistent with the model but
inconsistent with both the constant share and buy and hold rules. In the SCF data some
of the older investors behave like the daring agents in the model, perhaps because of cohort
effects. In Panel A, which reflects recent positive returns, older investors are actively buying to increase their stock share above the passive implied level for 2007. The reason they
need to buy is that, because they are levered, when there is a good shock their exposure

54

to risk decreases as wealth increases more than the value of their equity holdings. Younger
investors are either actively selling or simply not buying as much. Younger investors act like
the cautious agents in our model, avoiding large risky asset holdings after a positive shock.
In Panel B, which reflects recent negative returns, the patterns are reversed. Older investors
sell more than the passive implied quantity of assets, and younger investors buy more than
what would leave them at their passive level. These patterns are broadly consistent with the
model, but inconsistent with a constant share or buy and hold rule.
Our framework is useful for understanding how portfolios would respond to a stock market
crash in an economy where all investors were behaving optimally. Contrary to both the
constant share and buy and hold rules, after a market crash our investors increase their
share in risky assets relative to the pre-crash levels, though by different amounts depending
on their risk tolerance.
Finally, our analysis points to a principle that must hold much more generally than the
particular model we study here: funds that serve a nontrivial fraction of investors will have to
take into account general equilibrium constraints to be feasible and optimal. In particular,
many existing target-date funds, which follow simple linear allocation rules regardless of
economic conditions, will not be optimal for most people. Moreover, as target-date funds
become ubiquitous, they will become infeasible since they will not find counterparties to
trade with as they rebalance. Our particular model points to how “universal target-date
funds,” or funds that are optimal for all investors given risk tolerance and age, should adjust
their target asset allocation in response to economic shocks.

Appendix A: Stationary Markov Equilibrium

A.1

Definition of Equilibrium

This appendix defines the equilibrium and discusses its solution. For convenience, Section
4.5.3 is repeated here. As discussed in Section 4.5.3, the time-invariant equilibrium functions
associated with the model’s variables are denoted in bold. Consistent with the notation tradition of the literature on Markov equilibria, the prime (0) denotes the next period variables
or functions.
The idiosyncratic dividend growth rate shock G has a finite support {Gn }N
n=1 with probL
H
ability πn for each Gn . The middle-aged post-shock wealth w = (wM
, wM
) is the state
variable of the economy. We will use lower-case letters of variables to indicate the values of
the variables divided by same-dated dividends: x = X/D. ρY and ρM denote the marginal
propensities to consume for the young and the middle aged, respectively. ψj denotes the
constant fraction of agents of type j in each cohort. γj is the risk aversion parameter of type
j. α denotes the capital share, so the labor income of the young is wYj = wY = 1−α
for both
α
j = H, L.
We first define the recursive equilibrium by collecting the equations that fully characterize
the equilibrium, and then discuss these equations in more detail. Equation numbers in the
square brackets denote the corresponding equations in the main text. (Note that the crossreferenced equations are not normalized by dividends [capital letters instead of lower case
letters].)
The recursive equilibrium consists of price functions {p(w), R(w), Z(w, G0 )}, allocations

The first three consumption equations are relatively straightforward. Equations (SM.1)
and (SM.2) specify optimal consumption of young and middle-aged households, derived
from their savings-consumption tradeoffs under inter-temporal log utility, and old households
consume everything as in equation (SM.3).
The next four equations are related to the portfolio problems. To streamline the portfolio
problems of the young and the middle-aged, we define two return functions in equations
(SM.4) and (SM.6). The excess return function Z(w, G0 ) in equation (SM.4) specifies the
excess return of risky tree investment conditional on the dividend growth shock G0 next
period. The total return function φjM (w) in equation (SM.6) gives the total return on
savings under the optimal portfolio choice for the middle-aged, which are in the utility form
given the Epstein-Zin-Weil preferences. Equation (SM.5) gives the optimal risky asset share
for the middle-aged households. Equation (SM.7) gives the optimal risky asset shares of the
young.
The market clearing conditions specify the equilibrium price functions. The goods-market
clearing condition in equation (SM.8) is actually savings supply equals savings demand, and
specifies the tree price as a function of the sum of middle aged wealth, and the interest rate
function R(w) is implicitly given by the bond market clearing condition in equation (SM.9),
where optimal portfolio shares are functions of the interest rate R.
A-2

Let’s discuss in greater detail the law of motion for the middle-aged wealth vector. The
next-period middle-aged wealth vector is given by the portfolio choice of the young in the
current period, prices, and returns conditional on the dividend growth shock G0 next period.
Specifically, consider a young household of type j = {H, L} with savings of (1 − ρY )wY .
j
By investing optimally a share θY (w) of her savings in the risky asset, her returns at the
beginning of the next period (turning middle-aged) after the dividend growth rate shock G0
are given by equations (SM.11) and (SM.10). In the square brackets of the right-hand side,
the first term is the return on the part of savings in bonds and the second term is the return
on the part of savings in the tree. The total returns from both bonds and tree imply their
wealth when middle-aged for each possible dividend growth rate shock.
To derive the law of motion of wealth in a way that makes the Markov nature more
transparent, plug in the following relation into equations (SM.11) and (SM.10)

We derive

Existence of Equilibria

This section establishes the existence of the recursive equilibrium for our model. We first
state the result and then illustrate the proof.
PROPOSITION. There exists a recursive equilibrium that satisfies equations (SM.1)(SM.11).
Duffie, Geanokoplos, Mas-Colell, and McLennan (1994) have a result (Proposition 1.2)
under quite general conditions that if an equilibrium always exists for any finite-horizon,
then an ergodic Markov equilibrium also exists in the infinite horizon. In this section, we
will show that their general proof applies to our specific setting. Their proposition is stated
as follows.
PROPOSITION 1.2: Let G : S → P(S) be an expectations correspondence
and K be a compact subset of S. If, for every T ∈ N, there exists a T -horizon
equilibrium {S1, ....ST } for G such that St ∈ K almost surely for all t, then G
has an ergodic Markov equilibrium.
Duffie, Geanakoplos, Mas-Colell, and McLennan (1994) establish the existence of ergodic
Markov equilibria for a stochastic overlapping generations model in Theorem 2.1 as an example of their general theory. Their overlapping generations model is an endowment economy
with very general assumptions on fundamentals. It allows for l goods, n assets and m types
of agents in each cohort with an exogenous Markov shock process. They first establish that
an equilibrium exists for any finite horizon of their overlapping generations model, and then
invoke Proposition 1.2 to establish that a Markov equilibrium exists in the infinite horizon.
Their example nests our overlapping generations model as a special case with l = 1, n = 2,
m = 2, and an i.i.d. shock process, except for two minor differences. One minor difference
is that agents live for two periods in their setup instead of three periods in ours. The other
difference is that they assume that the utility is von Neumann-Morgenstern, while ours is
A-4

Epstein-Zin-Weil. These two minor modifications in our model do not affect the arguments
of their proof. The difference between two and three periods does not change the basic
argument of the proof. Furthermore, their proof uses only the continuity, monotonicity, and
concavity of the utility function, and the Epstein-Zin-Weil preferences have all these three
properties. The Epstein-Zin-Weil preferences do not satisfy the Independence of Irrelevant
Alternatives (IIA) of the von Neumann-Morgenstern utility, but this property is not required
for the proof. Thus, the generalization of the preferences does not change the proof either.
This appendix therefore proceeds by (a) giving a formal proof closely following an OLG
theorem of Duffie, Geanokoplos, Mas-Colell, and McLennan that an equilibrium exists for
any finite horizon, and then (b) formally applying Proposition 1.2 to establish that a Markov
equilibrium exists in the infinite horizon.
Below we show that their proof that equilibria exist for any finite horizon T ∈ N goes
through with our two minor modifications. The original proof was omitted in their paper.
We thank Andrew McLennan for providing us a copy of the omitted proof, which is attached
with this document for your reference. We go through their proof line by line, taking care
of any minor modifications that we have to make for our setup. We adopt their notation in
this section of the appendix for an easy comparison.
We now outline a proof, similar to Radner’s (1972), that T -horizon equilibria exist for
any T . Fix T ≥ 1. The space of T -period deterministic price paths is P , the set of pairs
(p, q) where p = (p1 , ..., pT ) and q = (q1, ..., qT ) are T -tuples of functions pt : Gt → [0, 1]2 and
qt : Gt → [0, 1] with (pt (G1 , G2 , ..., Gt), qt(G1 , G2 , ..., Gt)) ∈ ∆3 for all t and (G1 , G2 , ..., Gt).
p is asset price and q is goods price. ∆3 denotes the price simplex. In our model, there are
two types of assets, risk-free bonds and risky trees, and one good, implying that pt has two
dimensions and qt has one dimension.
The truncated consumption set is ℵ = [0, L] where L is a number large enough to include
the total endowment in any period. In our setup, L > α1 > 1, since α1 is total endowment
of goods in every period. The truncated portfolio set is Γ = [−L, L]2. For the risky tree,
the demand is bounded in [0, 1], and for the risk-free bond, it is bounded by [−L, L]. These
bounds are introduced to ensure that excess demand is bounded and compact-valued. In
equilibrium, these constraints do not bind.
The first difference between our setting and that of Duffie et al. is that we have a threeperiod rather than two-period generations model. That implies that we need to take care of
an extra cohort in each period and one extra period for each generation. As is shown below,
this generalization is straightforward.
An excess demand is a tuple (ζY , ζM , ζO , ξY , ξM ), where ζY = (ζYH1 , ζYL1 , ..., ζYHT , ζYLT ),

denotes the excess
demand for assets for cohort j = {Y, M} and type i = {H, L} in period t.
The excess demand (ζY , ζM , ζO , ξY , ξM ) is (truncated) individually feasible if, for all i, t,

out by asset a in period t. In our setup, only the young have the labor endowment eiY t (Gt ),
which is proportional to the dividend, so eiM t(Gt ) = eiOt(Gt ) = 0.
The excess demand (ζY , ζM , ζO , ξY , ξM ) is budget feasible for price path (p, q) if, for all i,

The excess demand (ζY , ζM , ζO , ξY , ξM ) is optimal for price path (p, q) if it is individually
feasible, budget feasible for (p, q), and no individual has another individually feasible and
budget feasible plan that yields higher utility. Note that since preferences are increasing,
continuous, and concave, the set of optimal excess demands for (p, q) is compact and convex.
The second difference between our setting and theirs is that we use the Epstein-Zin-Weil
preferences, while they use the von Neumann-Morgenstern utility. Note that the utility
function properties used in the proof apply equally to both their and our preferences.
An aggregate excess demand is a pair Ψ = (ψθ , ψx) where ψθ = (ψθ1 , ..., ψθT ) and ψx =
(ψx1, ..., ψxT ) are T -tuples of functions ψθt : Gt → R2 and ψxt : Gt → R. The aggregate
excess demand (ψθ , ψx) is said to be derived from (ζY , ζM , ζO , ξY , ξM ) if for all t and Gt

Note that if (ζY , ζM , ζO , ξY , ξM ) is budget feasible for (p, q) and (ψθ , ψx ) is derived from
(ζY , ζM , ζO , ξY , ξM ), then
pt (Gt ) · ψθt (Gt ) + qt (Gt )ψxt(Gt ) ≤ 0,
for all t and Gt . This is Walras’ Law.
For each price path (p, q) let Ψ(p, q) be the set of aggregate excess demands derived
from excess demands that are optimal for (p, q). The usual arguments show that Ψ is
a compact convex valued upper semicontinuous correspondence. In the proof McLennan

provided, Duffie, Geanakoplos, Mas-Colell, and McLennan established a generalization of
the Debreu-Gale-Kuhn-Nikaido lemma as follows.

Then there exists r? ∈ (∆A )B and z ? ∈ F (r?) with z ? ≤ 0.
This Proposition guarantees the existence of a price path (p? , q ?) and an aggregate excess demand (ψθ?, ψx?) ∈ Ψ(p? , q ?) with ψθ?(Gt ) ≤ 0 and ψx? (Gt ) ≤ 0 for all t and Gt . Let

(ζY? , ζM

) are optimal, i.e., the constraints ζjti? ∈ ℵ and ξjt

these artificial constraints. But (ζY? , ζM
, ζO? , ξY? , ξM
) specifies consumption bundles and portfolios that are feasible in the aggregate, so the artificial constraints are satisfied with strict
inequality, and the desired result follows from the concavity of all utility functions. Thus,
we establish the existence of equilibrium in any finite horizon case for our setting.
Since the amount of each good available in each state and date is bounded uniformly,
both above and away from zero, there is a compact set K almost surely containing all states
reached in any such T -horizon equilibrium. Therefore, Proposition 1.2 implies the existence
of a stationary Markov equilibrium in our setting for the infinite horizon.
To recap the strategy of the proof, we cite Duffie et. al. page 763:
We induce a T -period equilibria for all finite horizons T ∈ N as follows. ...
For each T these preferences induce a T -period finite-state Radner (1972) style
event-tree economy. Then, by an argument similar to Radner’s, we establish the
existence of an S T -valued random variable that is a T -horizon equilibrium for G,
in the sense of our central results. ... Since the amount of each good available
in each state and date is bounded uniformly, both above and away from zero,
there is a compact set K almost surely containing all states reached in any such
T -horizon equilibrium. Proposition 1.2 now implies the existence of a compact
self-justified set J for g, and the desired conclusion follows from Proposition 1.3.

This section shows that their proof applies to our model. Therefore, there exists a
stationary Markov equilibrium for our model.

Equilibrium Solution

Having shown the existence of Markov equilibria, we now describe how to find such an equilibrium. This section details the computation algorithm in our paper. We use backward
induction to solve for time-invariant equilibrium functions. We start from a terminal period to serve as the transversality condition and to rule out sunspots. We solve the model
backward from the last period. In each period t, we obtain the optimal policy functions
j
{cjY t(w), cjMt(w), cjOt(w), θYj t(w), θMt
(w), Rt (w), pt(w), Zt (w, Gt+1 ), wt0 (w, Gt+1 )}. We
move backward until the optimal policy functions in period t and period t − 1 converge
j
to obtain the time-invariant equilibrium functions {cjY (w), cjM (w), cjO(w), θYj (w), θM
(w),
0
0
0
R(w), p(w), Z(w, G ), w (w, G )}. Note that we need to index functions by time since the
solution iterates backwards until the policy functions converge to the stationary equilibrium.
Now we describe this backward induction.

Last Period T

Optimal choices at time T are simple: all agents consume their wealth and the stock price
is zero. Since there is no saving, the portfolio share is irrelevant. Thus, for j = H and L, we

This implies (1−ρYα)(1−α) ≤ pT −k(w) ≤ α(1−ρM )+(1−α)(1−ρ

Here is some intuition for the bounds on the tree price. The lower bound is given by
the minimum possible demand for the tree. Suppose the middle-aged have zero financial
wealth, so they have a zero demand for savings. The old always have zero demand for
savings. In that case, demand for net savings, which can only be provided by the tree, is
equal to young’s demand for savings, and the young’s demand for savings will determine
the tree price. Since the young have to live through the next two periods without labor
income, they need savings of (1−ρYα)(1−α) , which gives the lower bound for the tree price.
Now consider the upper bound for the tree price. The young still demand (1−ρYα)(1−α) in
savings, but now suppose the middle-aged own all the financial wealth of the economy 1 + pt
and so have savings demand of (1 − ρM )(1 + pt ). Then the maximum tree price is given by
pt = (1−ρYα)(1−α) + (1 − ρM )(1 + pt ), which can be solved to give the upper bound on the tree
price.
Now we need to show the existence of the price function RT −k(w), the law of motion of wealth wT0 −k(w, Gn ) and the portfolio function ΘT −k(w) = {θYHT −k(w), θYL T −k(w),
H
L
θMT
−k(w), θMT −k(w)} such that (i) given prices and the law of motion for wealth, the
portfolio choices ΘT−k(w) are optimal; (ii) the law of the motion is consistent with the
agents’ choices; and (iii) the prices clear the markets.
Given the interest rate RT −k(w), and the next-period state variable wT0 −k(w, Gn ), the
agents know the next period tree price pT −k+1 (wT0 −k(w, Gn )), and the total return for the
j
middle-aged next period, φMT −k+1 (wT0 −k(w, Gn )) by solving the problem of period T −k+1.
The implied excess returns are

Thus, given functions {RT −k(w), wT0 −k(w, Gn )}, we can solve for the optimal portfolio

However, numerically for our parameters, θM
T −1 decreases with RT −1 and the excess demand
decreases with RT −1 , as illustrated in Figure 9. For a reasonably typical value of w, the top
two panels plot the optimal portfolio shares over different values of the risk-free interest
rate for the low-risk-tolerant and the high-risk-tolerant households, and the bottom panel
plots the excess demand. As the risk-free rate increases and the excess tree return decreases,
households decrease their risky asset shares. The excess demand increases with the interest
rate. Thus, there exists a unique RT −1 that clears the bond market. One stable method for
solving R(w) is thus the bisection technique, starting with the lower bound set at a value

Appendix B: Price and Return Dynamics
In this appendix we describe the price and return dynamics implied by the model in more
detail.
The dependence of the risky asset share of the young cohort as a whole on the shock right
before they begin investing makes it possible to explain the behavior of the price-dividend
ratio. Recall that the price-dividend ratio is determined exactly by the total middle-aged
wealth in each period. See Equation (36). Because of the Cobb-Douglas production function
and the constant average propensity to consume, the invested wealth of the young cohort is
a fixed fraction of output, or equivalently, in a fixed ratio to the dividend. Their later wealth
in middle age in comparison with the dividend at that time depends on their overall portfolio
return compared to the growth rate of the dividend. Let us explain the general level of the
price-dividend ratio after each of the four possible histories of the last two shocks.
A good shock leading into the youth of the current middle-aged cohort depressed their
risky asset share when young, and they were significantly underlevered relative to the economy as a whole. Then a second good shock will actually cause the growth rate of their wealth
to fall behind the growth rate of the dividend (which equals the growth rate of economic
production as a whole). Middle-aged wealth that is smaller relative to the expanded size
of the economy will then lead to a low price-dividend ratio (in part because dividends are
large). In contrast, a bad shock as they go into middle age causes the economy to grow more
slowly than their relatively safer portfolio, leading to a high middle-aged wealth to dividend
ratio, which in turn implies a high price-dividend ratio.
The bad shock leading into the youth of the current middle-aged cohort led that cohort
to have slightly elevated risky asset holdings and thus to be slightly overlevered relative to
the economy as a whole. A good shock at middle age then leads them to have a high level
of wealth relative to the economy as a whole, leading in turn to a high price-dividend ratio.
In contrast, a bad shock at middle age causes them to have a low level of wealth relative to
the economy as a whole, leading in turn to a low price-dividend ratio.
Note that the last shock makes a bigger difference for the price-dividend ratio between
the (Good, Good) and (Good, Bad) histories than it does between the (Bad, Good) and
(Bad, Bad) histories. The reason is that the daring middle-aged agents in the previous
period pulled more dramatically ahead of the economy after a good shock leading into their
middle age than they fell behind the economy after a bad shock leading into their middle
age. This led the current middle-aged cohort to have a significantly underlevered portfolio
after a good shock leading into their youth, but only slightly overlevered portfolio after a
bad shock leading into their youth.
To summarize the history dependence of prices, we present the key price statistics conditional on the current shock, the past shock, and the two past shocks in Table A1. The
kind of reasoning above can be extended to interpret the consequences of a longer history
of shocks, but the most recent shocks have the most powerful effect on the model economy.
One reason we include the effects of a three-shock history is the identity relating the realized

Thus, the realized tree return depends on the values of the price-dividend ratio in two
different periods. Among three-shock histories, the realized tree return is highest after
(Good, Good, Good) since the two good shocks at t − 2 and t − 1 depress pt−1 , while the
good shock at t gives a high Gt .11 The realized tree return is lowest after the three-shock
history (Good, Bad, Bad) because the combination of a good shock at t − 2 followed by a
bad shock at t − 1 elevates pt−1 , while the bad shock at t gives a low Gt .

Note: Pt /Dt denotes the price-dividend ratio, log Rt denotes the log risk free interest rate, log RTree
denotes the log
t
realized tree return, given by log(Dt + Pt ) − log Pt−1 , E(log RTree
) denotes the expected log tree return, and E(log Zt )
t
denotes the expected log excess return. All prices are annualized. All prices are in percentage, except the price-dividend
ratio. Gt , Gt−1 and Gt−2 denote the dividend growth rate shock in period t, t − 1 and t − 2, respectively.

Table A1 also shows that the risk free rate is higher after a good shock than after a
bad shock in period t. This pattern becomes particularly pronounced after a good shock in
period t − 1. The expected tree return is higher after a good shock in period t. However, the
pattern does not hold when we consider a two-period history of shocks. After a good shock
in period t − 1, the expected tree return is higher after a good shock. In contrast, after a
bad shock in period t − 1, the expected tree return is higher after a bad shock. The expected
excess return is lower after a good shock in period t, given the high aggregate risk tolerance
after a good shock in period t. The expected excess return is especially low after a history
of the bad and good shocks.

11

The realized tree return is second-highest after the three-shock history (Bad, Bad, Good) not only
because two bad shocks at t − 2 and t − 1 depress pt−1 somewhat, but also because the tail end of a bad
shock at t − 1 followed by a good shock at t puts pt at a reasonably high level as well as giving a high Gt .

Appendix C: Alternative Parameterizations
We solve the model with different sets of numerical assumptions to determine how robust
our primary findings are. First, we recalculate the risk tolerances of cautious and daring
agents setting the standard deviation of risk tolerance equal to 0.085, which is half of the
standard deviation of the risk tolerances listed in Table 1. We then solve the model with
the other assumptions in Table 1 and report results analogous to Table 2 below. Next we
we double the standard deviation of risk tolerances. Finally, we both halve and double the
standard deviations of economic shocks and report the results below. In each case we find
results that are qualitatively similar to those obtained with our main parameterization in
the text.

Note: The portfolio share is the ratio of risky assets and savings of each type, the savings weight is the
fraction of each type’s savings in total savings, and the tree amount is the amount of tree held by each type.
In particular, the tree amount equals the savings weight times the portfolio share for each type. Both the
tree amount and the savings weight should sum up to 100 percent across types. Savings is after-consumption
wealth. Gt denotes the dividend growth rate shock in period t.
