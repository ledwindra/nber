Are Patent Fees Effective at Weeding out Low-quality Patents?

December 2014, Revised June 2016

ABSTRACT
The paper investigates whether patent fees are an effective mechanism to deter the filing of lowquality patent applications. The study analyzes the effect on patent quality of the Patent Law
Amendment Act of 1982, which resulted in a substantial increase in patenting fees at the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office. Results from a series of difference-in-differences regressions
suggest that the increase in fees led to a weeding out of low-quality patents. About 14 per cent of
patents in the lowest quality decile were filtered out, and the effect was especially visible for
companies with a large patent portfolio. The study has strong policy implications in the current
context of concerns about declines in patent quality.

1. Introduction
There is much current concern among both scholars and the business press that the issuance
of large numbers of low-quality patents is increasing litigation costs and harming innovation
incentives (e.g., Barton, 2000; Bessen and Meurer, 2008; Feldman 2014; The Economist,
2015). Concerns about low-quality patents are particularly acute in the United States and
China (Giacopello, 2012; Liang 2012) but the issue is very much a global one. Data by the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development suggest that patent quality has
declined in the 2000s compared to the 1990s in all advanced economies (OECD, 2011:190).
The main patent offices around the world acknowledge the importance of delivering highquality patents and are committed to improving quality standards.1
A potential decline in patent quality raises several inter-related policy concerns. First,
the basic welfare tradeoff inherent in patents—incentives to innovate and reveal information
balanced against static and dynamic monopoly distortions—is problematic when monopoly is
granted for non-novel or obvious inventions. It might seem that the harm from such patents is
limited by the likelihood that they are invalid and hence unenforceable, but, Lemley and
Shapiro (2005) point out that patents are seldom (in)valid with certainty. This creates a
deadweight loss and distorts ex-ante incentives to engage in research (Farrell and Shapiro,
2008). Bessen and Meurer (2008:145) argue along these lines that the patent system has
turned from a source of net subsidy to R&D to a net tax. Second, as patents become easier to
obtain, the patenting of marginal inventions increases, which may lead to a fragmentation of
intellectual property (IP) rights. Fragmentation significantly raises the cost of access to and
use of knowledge and may ultimately lower R&D investment (Heller and Eisenberg, 1998).
This loss is exacerbated by the cumulative process that is prominent in complex technology
industries (Hunt, 2006; Bessen and Maskin, 2009). Finally, the decrease in patent quality
creates self-reinforcing operational challenges to patent offices. A perception that marginal
applications are likely to be successful encourages more such applications; the resulting
increase in the rate of application strains examination resources, likely resulting in continued
decline in quality—if the patent office does a rush job to maintain reasonable levels of
backlog and pendency (Caillaud and Duchêne, 2011; van Pottelsberghe, 2011).
Most fixes for the quality problem, such as more rigorous examination, or
implementing additional options for post-grant review of examiner decisions, require
increased resources devoted to maintenance of quality. But the interactions among
application decision, the resource cost of examination, and patent quality suggest that
reduction in the incentive to apply for low-quality patents through an appropriate fee
schedule might significantly reduce the social cost of achieving the desired level of patent
quality. Further, there are theoretical reasons to expect that an increase in patent fees would

disproportionately discourage low-quality applications. The objective of this paper is to
investigate whether patent fees act effectively ex-ante to screen patent quality, by testing
whether a fee increase caused a reduction in the proportion of low-quality patents. This
research question fits into the broad literature on the optimal design of patent systems (see,
for example, DeBrock, 1985; Matutes et al., 1996; Gallini, 2002; Farrell and Shapiro, 2008;
Stiglitz, 2014), and more particularly on the use of fees as a policy tool (see, for example,
Scotchmer, 1999; Gans et al., 2004; Caillaud and Duchêne, 2011).
To answer the research question this paper exploits a quasi-natural experiment that
occurred in the United States in 1982. To address the declining financial situation of the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) in an era of increasingly tight budgets for federal
agencies, Congress passed the Patent Law Amendment Act (PLAA), which resulted in a
substantial increase in overall patenting costs. We postulate that the effective fee increase was
smaller for foreign firms seeking to extend to the U.S. patent protection already sought for in
other countries. This allows us to compare the change in the proportion of low-quality foreign
applications to the change for domestic applications in a difference-in-differences (DiD)
formulation. We build on the latent quality model by Lanjouw and Schankerman (2004), but
we expand on that model to allow for separate latent variables for patent quality and patent
value, based on four commonly-used patent metrics.
To anticipate the results, we find evidence of a significant trimming of low-quality
patents after the reform. Estimates suggest that 14 per cent of patents in the lowest quality
decile were filtered out. The figure reaches 15 per cent for patents in the lowest value decile
and 19 per cent for patents in the lowest value quintile. The result is robust to a range of
alternative specifications. The effect on quality was particularly strong for companies with a
large patent portfolio. 	  
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides background
information on patent quality, the use of fees to screen quality, and the reform. Section 3
presents the data and Section 4 presents the econometric framework and results. The last
section offers policy implications.
2. Background
Patent quality and patent value
The concept of patent quality is widely discussed but not always precisely defined. In a
theoretical model, patent quality can be defined as the size of the inventive step, i.e. the
distance along a technology line that separates the invention from the best pre-existing
invention. In a world of certainty and perfect information, the statutory standard for
patentability can be represented as a minimum qualifying inventive step: inventions that
embody a step of that size or higher are granted and otherwise not. If the inventive step of an
invention is uncertain and/or imperfectly observed, then inventions with a bigger inventive
3
	  

step are more likely to be granted, but some small inventive-step patents are also granted.
Conditional on being granted, a patent on an invention with a larger inventive step is more
likely to be upheld as valid if challenged. From this perspective, the problem of patent quality
is some combination of patent offices’ systematically using too low an inventive step
threshold, and their making too many mistakes in evaluating the inventive step of patent
applications (de Rassenfosse et al., 2016).
As discussed further below, empirical analysis of patent quality is sometimes unclear
on the relationship between patent quality and patent value. One of our goals is to establish
an empirical framework for relating these two concepts. Starting first from a theoretical
perspective, a higher quality invention is likely to be more valuable, all else equal. First, it is
more likely to be upheld as valid if challenged. In addition, though this is somewhat more
speculative, it seems likely that all else equal a high-quality invention is likely to generate
greater market demand due to its intrinsic degree of technical superiority over pre-existing
substitutes. In a similar vein, an invention with a higher inventive step may also be more
challenging to invent around, providing a longer monopoly period to its owner.
But of course all else is not equal, and there are several factors that affect value that
are not related to invention quality. Some markets are inherently bigger than others, e.g. as
between two therapeutic advances of equal technological magnitude, the one that relates to a
widespread disease will be more valuable than the one that relates to a rare disease. Further,
even for markets of a given size, the elasticity of demand with respect to product attributes
can differ, so that a given increment of technological superiority may translate to a larger
market share in some markets than in others. Finally, patent value depends on the value of
patent protection, as distinct from the value of the patented invention, and this can vary
because of the relative efficacy of patent protection and other appropriation mechanisms in
different contexts.
In summary, patent quality and patent value are distinct concepts, but likely to be
positively correlated. The empirical magnitude of the correlation will depend on the variance
of the aspects of value that do not relate to quality relative to the variance in patent quality.
We will return below to the empirical challenge of distinguishing quality and value.
Patent quality, patent value and patent fees
As far as we can ascertain, there has been no empirical study of any relationship between fees
and quality. Empirical studies on patent fees have focused mainly on estimating the price
elasticity of demand for patent applications. Estimates performed on patent filing fees
typically vary around -0.3, meaning that a ten per cent increase in fees results in a three per
cent decrease in the number of patent applications (de Rassenfosse and van Pottelsberghe,
2012).

4
	  

Starting with Scotchmer (1999) and Cornelli and Schankerman (1999), economists
have simply assumed that patent fees can be used to screen quality. Caillaud and Duchêne
(2011) explicitly look at patent filing fees in the context of congested patent offices with
imperfect examination. They show that there exists a range of values of application fees that
lead to a unique high-R&D equilibrium in which firms self-select in their decision to apply
for a patent. Picard and van Pottelsberghe (2013) study how the mode of governance of
patent offices affects the setting of fees and the quality of the examination process. In their
model, the willingness to pay the fees increases with the inventiveness of the patent.
It is theoretically likely that both low-quality and low-value inventions would be
disproportionately reduced by an increase in fees. Consider the following. The owner of an
invention applies for a patent when the expected benefit from patent protection (probability
of grant times economic value of receiving patent protection) exceeds the patenting cost.2
When fees are increased, some applications for which the expected value was marginally
positive will no longer be profitable to pursue. The marginal applications deterred by a fee
increase could be marginal for different reasons. Some of them are marginal because the
applicant understands that their chances of grant are low, i.e. they are low-quality. Some of
them are marginal because the value of the patent, even if granted, is not very high, and this
could be true in some cases despite the quality of the invention being high, for the reasons
discussed above.
While it is theoretically expected that a fee increase would screen out both lowquality and low-value inventions, the relative empirical significance of the two is unclear.
Further the policy implications are quite different. It is the job of a patent office to screen out
low-quality inventions, so a fee increase that accomplishes that is normatively helpful. But
the stated mission of the patent office is not to screen out inventions that just happen to have
low (private) value.3 Hence from a policy perspective, fees are only successful as a screening
device to the extent that they reduce the number of low-quality patents, not just low-value
patents. Thus the importance of the empirical challenge of distinguishing quality and value,
to which we return below.
The U.S. Patent Law Amendment Act of 1982
Implementation of the PLAA, which resulted in a significant increase in patent fees, provides
a useful policy-change framework for studying the effect of fees on patent quality. It led to
the largest increase in fees in the history of the USPTO (de Rassenfosse and van
Pottelsberghe, 2013) and it occurred sufficiently long ago for ex-post patent quality indicators
to be available without truncation. It was also implemented for reasons that are not related to

We return in Section 4.2 to the possibility that patent applications are filed for reasons other than the
maximization of expected value.

However, such a policy goal would be desirable if low value inventions resulted from R&D investments that
the firm would have made anyway, that is, absent of the patent system.

5
	  

concerns about quality.4 At that time, indeed, patent quality at the USPTO was not yet an
issue. The fee increase became effective on October 1, 1982.
Patenting costs were affected as follows. Official fees from filing to grant rose from
an estimated $239 before the reform (H.R. 96-1307) to $800 after the reform. In addition, the
reform also introduced renewal fees, which are due 3.5, 7.5, and 11.5 years from the date of
the original patent grant. Renewal fees increase linearly with age, from $400 in year 3.5 to
$1,200 in year 11.5. Thus the fees for maintaining a patent to full term rose from $239 to
$3,200.
Skeptics may advance several reasons why filing fees would have only a limited
impact on patent quality. A first, commonly-heard argument is that patent fees represent only
a fraction of patenting cost, which also includes attorney fees. Based on a survey of patent
attorneys, Helfgott (1993) reported that patent attorney fees in the United States averaged
around $635 in 1992. Assuming that attorney fees followed the evolution of the consumer
price index would give a 1983 figure of $440. Thus, while the precise share of patent fees in
total application cost cannot be determined, the available evidence suggests that the PLAA
fee changes represented a significant increase in total application cost.
Second, patenting costs are usually modest in comparison with R&D costs, such that
they would only marginally affect the decision to apply for a patent. Sunk R&D costs should
not be relevant for the patent application decision, so this argument must really boil down to
an assertion that the expected economic return from patent application is large relative to the
patent fees. But, by definition, this is not true for marginal patent applications, so even if for
most applications the fees are not a consideration, theory still suggests that they should have
an effect on potential applications near the margin of economic viability. These are precisely
the low-quality applications for which we wish to measure the impact.
A final argument is that patents are usually filed early in the life of innovation
projects, so it is possible that the evaluation error of invention owners at that time is so large
as to make the application decision nearly random.5 In a seminal article, Griliches
(1990:1699) discusses precisely this issue. He argues that under perfect information about
invention quality, a rise in the cost of patenting would deter the marginal, low-quality
inventions. At the other extreme, too large a degree of uncertainty at the time of filing would
limit the effectiveness of patent fees as a screening device. Griliches’ opinion is explicit:

The PLAA was largely adopted to strengthen the financial resources of the USPTO in an era of increasingly
tight budgets for federal agencies. According to a 1980 House Report (H.R. 96-1307), patent fees had not been
adjusted since 1967. At that time, the fee structure provided revenue which met 67 per cent of the costs of
operating the USPTO. By 1980 inflation had reduced the real value of patent fees, which were estimated to
cover a mere 27 per cent of the operating costs (Public Law 97-247).
5
For instance, Kondo (1999) analyzes the dynamic mechanism of the R&D-patent relationship of Japanese
industry and shows that R&D expenditure leads to patent applications with a 1.5 year time-lag. Pakes (1986)
estimates an option model of patents and finds evidence of a learning effect early in patent life.

6
	  

“The truth, I believe, is somewhere in the middle, but closer to the first case, with some
definite knowledge about the potential importance of the particular invention.”
Thus, at the end of the day, it is an empirical question whether fees are significant
enough to affect the application decision. Theory suggests that if there is any effect, it should
be seen most clearly for applications at the margin of being worth patenting. The PLAA
provides an opportunity to test for this effect.
3. Data and Descriptive Statistics
Figure 1 shows the monthly evolution of the number of USPTO utility patents granted, by
application date. The effect of the reform is clearly visible, with a peak in patenting activity
in September 1982, immediately followed by a drop in October. This suggests that applicants
rushed to file their patent applications before the fee increase, providing a first sign that fees
matter. The reform also seems to have had a lasting effect on the demand for patents. The
total number of patent applications fell from 116,052 in 1982 to 96,847 in 1983 and 109,010
in 1984. At the same time, total funds for industrial R&D grew by 9 per cent annually, from
US 93,496 million in 1982 to US 110,553 million in 1984 (in constant 2000 dollar terms).6

3.1 Patent quality indicators
Our theoretical expectation is that low-quality and low-value potential patent applications
would have been differentially screened out by the fee increase. We expect that the ex post
distribution of quality or value was shifted to the right, and shifted more for domestic patents
than for foreign patents. To test for this effect, we need an empirical proxy for patent quality
and patent value.
There is an existing literature on indicators of patent quality, but the existing literature
often does not distinguish whether the proposed indicator is measuring quality or value. As
noted above, anything that contributes to quality can be expected to contribute to value, but
the converse is not true: some measures of value may not necessarily reflect quality, to the
extent they are driven by other factors such as market size. We use four indicators that have
been identified in the literature with patent quality or value: the number of citations received
by the patent (Y1); the number of independent claims at grant (Y2); the size of the patent
family (Y3); and the number of times the patent was renewed (Y4). As explained below, we
consider citations and claims to be indicative of both quality and value, but we treat family
size and renewal as indicative of value but not quality.
The number of citations received by a patent has been shown to be a good measure of
its technological importance (e.g., Carpenter et al., 1981; Narin et al., 1987; Albert et al.,
1991) as well as its economic value (Trajtenberg, 1990). Other authors have also used citation
data to estimate the probability that a patent should be granted (Palangkaraya et al., 2011).
Recent criticisms have questioned the use of patent citations as measures of knowledge flows,
because many citations are added by examiners and not by applicants themselves (Alcácer
and Gittelman, 2006). As far as patent quality is concerned, however, there is evidence that
examiner citations actually increase the informational content of citation counts (Hegde and
Sampat, 2009). See Jaffe and de Rassenfosse (forthcoming) for a review.
The number of claims has been used as an indicator of the breadth and the
profitability of an invention (Tong and Frame, 1994; Lanjouw and Schankerman, 2004).
Claims are the substance of a patent. They codify the description of the invention and
constitute the scope of protection in case of grant. In estimates of the values of U.S. patents
Bessen (2008) finds that each additional claim increases value by about 2 per cent (as
revealed by renewal data).
Patent claims can be independent or dependent. An independent claim stands by itself
in defining a technology that the inventor “claims” has not been previously implemented. A
dependent claim represents a further specification or description of subject matter already
covered by an independent claim in the same patent.7 As far as we are aware, all previous
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
7

To illustrate with a clearly non-novel example, an independent claim could be “Claim 1: A device for holding
stuff up, consisting of a horizontal surface supported by four vertical members of equal length.” A dependent

8
	  

empirical work using claims as a proxy for patent quality have simply counted the total
number of claims, independent and dependent. However, by definition dependent claims
cover subject matter that is a proper subset of that covered by the parent independent claim,
and so the count of independent claims alone should be a better indicator of patent quality in
the sense of the magnitude of the inventive step. Hence we utilize the count of independent
claims.
The family size is the number of jurisdictions in which patent protection is sought. It
was first used by Putnam (1996) and Lanjouw et al. (1998). The rationale is that inventions
protected by a large international family are of high value given the many costs incurred in
the international patent application process. Using data from a survey of patent holders in
Germany, Harhoff et al. (2003) report that patents representing large international families
correlate particularly well with estimates of patent values. There is, however, no direct path
by which family size relates to patent quality, so we consider it an indicator of value but not
quality.
The number of times the patent was renewed is also a useful indicator of patent value.
Most patent offices require the regular payment of renewal fees in order to keep the patent in
force. The use of patent renewal data rests on the premise that inventions for which patent
protection is more valuable will tend to be protected by payment of renewal fees for longer
periods (Schankerman and Pakes, 1986). Renewal fees at the USPTO are due 3.5, 7.5, and
11.5 years from the date of the original patent grant. As explained in section 2, renewal fees
were introduced with the reform. However, the change with respect to renewal fees was
applied retroactively, such that renewal fees had to be paid for all the patents applied for on
or after December 12, 1980. This feature allows us to track the number of renewals for
patents both before and after the fee change. As with family size, there is no direct pathway
by which renewals are connected to patent quality, so we consider it only as an indicator of
value.
The population includes 223,408 utility patents filed in a 21-month period before and
after the PLAA, that is, from January 1, 1981 to June 30, 1984. The choice of the start date is
motivated by the fact that January 1981 is the first month for which all the patent quality
indicators can be constructed. Data sources and technical details are relegated to the Data
Appendix.
Table 1 reports the descriptive statistics for the four metrics. Patents in the sample
received an average of 5.81 citations in the ten-year period following grant and have 2.10
independent claims. They have an average family size of 4.24, meaning that they were
extended to 3.24 jurisdictions besides the United States.

3.2 Proportion of lower-tier patents before and after the fee increase
Table 2 shows that the proportion of lower-tier patents decreased after the PLAA. For each
metric, a cut-off value between ‘low’ and ‘high’ was chosen somewhat arbitrarily but in such
a way that a relatively small fraction of all patents are classified as ‘low’: those that have no
citation; three or less claims; a family size of one; or never been renewed. The proportion of
lower-tier patents is reported before and after the fee change for the population of U.S.
patents and for a more restricted sample that is used for further analysis below.

Notes: Quality thresholds used: citations = 0; independent claims = 1; family size = 1; renewals = 1. The
samples exclude patents filed in the first month before and after the PLAA. See Table A-1 in Data Appendix for
sample construction. Standard errors in parentheses. * indicates that the difference in proportion is significantly
different from zero at the 0.5 per cent probability threshold.

The proportion of lower-tier patents was markedly lower after the fee increase, for
every metric and in both samples. For example, there are 13.39 per cent of patents in the
population of U.S. patents that have no citation before the fee increase down to 11.31 after
the increase. The difference is 2.08 percentage points and is significantly different from zero

10
	  

at the 0.5 per cent probability threshold.8 The decrease in the proportion of lower-tier patents
is in the range 1.05–5.13 percentage points across all indicators and samples.
Table 2 presents some prima facie evidence that the fee increase was associated with
a filtering out of low-quality patents. There are, however, three important limitations with the
figures presented. First, for any one of the metrics, there may be non-screening reasons for
the observed decrease in the number of low-quality patents. For example, the fee increase
may have induced firms to cram more claims into each patent application. Second, these
metrics may to some extent capture invention value instead of quality. More generally, as
with any change over time, there may be other temporally changing factors that are driving
the observed effect (such as an inflation of citation rate), rather than the fee increase itself. To
deal with these issues, next section presents a framework that optimally combines the
information from the multiple indicators to recover an implicit ‘true’ quality indicator. The
framework also utilizes a DiD formulation to isolate the effect of the fee change from other
temporal changes.
4. Econometric results
4.1 Non-linear latent variable model of patent quality and value
We build on the latent quality model of Lanjouw and Schankerman (2004). In its original
version, the model estimates a linear latent variable that captures variations in observed
‘quality’ indicators, where ‘quality’ captures the technological importance of the innovation
and market opportunities. We seek to improve the original model in two substantial ways.
The first improvement is the use of a non-linear latent variable model, which allows better
capturing the distributional features of the data. The second improvement is the use of two
latent variables, V* and Q*, capturing the economic value and the technical quality of the
inventions, respectively. Our model is more flexible than the original model but flexibility
comes at the cost of a significantly greater computational complexity.
We estimate the following model:
𝐸 𝑌! 𝑄∗ , 𝑉 ∗ =   𝐺(𝐶𝛽!,! + 𝐿𝛽!,! + 𝑉 ∗ 𝛽!,! + 𝑄∗ 𝛽!,! )
where 𝑌! (k=1,…,4) is the N×1vector of values for the k-th quality indicator, G(.) is a link
function, C is the vector 1 (with all entries equal to 1), L is a dummy vector that captures
whether the assignee is local, V* is the vector of latent economic value with factor loading
𝛽!,! with 𝛽!,! = 1 to allow for identification, Q* is the vector of latent technical quality with
factor loading 𝛽!,! with 𝛽!,! = 1 to allow for identification. We further impose identification
restrictions in the form 𝛽!,! = 0 for some k as discussed next.

We rely on conservative evidence thresholds for the declaration of significant coefficients (p-value of 0.005)
following Johnson (2013). The author shows that commonly-used levels of significance represent only weak
evidence in favour of hypothesised effects and argues for the use of more stringent thresholds.

11
	  

The four indicators are: the number of citations (𝑌! ); the number of independent
claims (𝑌! ); the size of the patent family (𝑌! ); and the number of times the patent was
renewed (𝑌! ). We note that the use of the number of independent claims instead of the total
number of claims is another improvement over existing studies. Independent claims are
directed to the essential features of the invention and, therefore, are better suited to capture
information about the scope of the invention.
We assume that 𝑌! has a negative binomial distribution for k=1,2,3 to account for
overdispersion in count data and use a log link function. We assume that 𝑌! has an ordinal
distribution and use a probit link function. We set two identification restrictions, namely
𝛽!,! = 𝛽!,! = 0. In concrete terms, these restrictions mean that the technical quality of the
invention has no effect on the patent family size and the number of times the patent was
renewed—these dimensions being predominantly associated with the economic value of an
invention.
Figure 2 depicts the distribution of the latent variables. Both variables are skewed to
the right, which conforms to our expectations. The skewness of the latent quality variable is
particularly strong, as indicated in the left panel.

Table 3 presents the correlation coefficients between the latent variables and the

independent claims, followed by the number of forward citations. By construction, the
correlation between the quality variable and the family size and renewal indicators is about
zero. Note also the positive correlation coefficient of 0.35 between the latent quality variable
and the latent value variable. It suggests that higher quality patents are also more valuable.

4.2 Difference-in-differences (DiD) estimates
The empirical analysis seeks to quantify the intensity of the weeding out of low-quality
patents. We ask: how many low-quality patents did the fee increase weed out, where we
define low-quality patents as patents situated in the lowest deciles of the quality distribution.
The gist of the identification strategy is to use difference in the sensitivity to fees across
groups of applicants. Indeed, foreign applicants face greater overall patenting cost than U.S.
applicants: in addition to application cost at home, foreign applicants have to incur
application cost at the USPTO and possibly translation cost of their patent document into
English. Hence, if patent application fees affect quality, the increase in observed quality
should be higher for priority filings by U.S. applicants compared to second filings by foreign
applicants. For example, we observe that ten percent of patents by local assignees before the
fee increase have a quality Q* ≤ -0.084, and we seek to estimate the proportion of patents
with Q* ≤ -0.084 after the fee increase for both local and foreign applicants.
Table 4 presents econometric estimates for two thresholds of the latent variables:
patents below the first decile in column (1)–(3); and patents below the first quintile (i.e., first
and second deciles) in columns (4)–(6). Results in Panel A relate to the latent quality variable
whereas results in Panel B relate to the latent value variable. Focusing on Panel A, results in
columns (1) and (4) show that fewer patents fell below the set quality thresholds after the
reform. DiD estimates are reported in columns (2)–(3) and (5)–(6). Results in column (2) read
as follows. By construction, approximately 10 per cent of patents by locals before the PLAA
were in the low-quality group. After the fee increase, only 8.8 per cent (=0.097+0.006-0.0010.014) of patents by locals were in the low-quality group, and we estimate that the reform led
to at least a 1.4 percentage points decrease in the proportion of low-quality patents
(coefficient associated with variable post × local). This figure corresponds to a trimming of
14 per cent of low-quality patents. It is a lower bound estimate of the true effect given that
the control group of second filings by foreign applicants was also affected by the fee increase.
The upper bound estimate is 15 per cent (=0.014+0.001). Column (3) controls for technology
and year effects, as well as for changes in the composition of patented technologies after the
13
	  

PLAA. Again, the treatment effect (post × local) is negative and highly significant. However,
it seems that only the lowest quality patents were affected: the coefficient associated with the
treatment effect is negative but not statistically different from 0 when we use the first quintile
of the quality variable in columns (5)–(6).
Turning to panel B, the results suggest that the reform also had an effect on the value
of patent applications submitted, leading to a 1.5 percentage points decrease in the first decile
of value and a 1.9 percentage points decrease in the first quintile. That the PLAA had a
stronger and more persistent effect on the value of patents compared to the quality of patents
conforms with our expectation, increasing confidence in the relevance of the overall latent
variables.
For an external observer the fact that patents are filed for reasons other than
maximization of expected value (e.g., some patent applications are used as metric for staff
scientist performance) has similar effects on ex-post quality and value metrics than applicants
not being able to tell ex-ante which patents are valuable: it limits the effectiveness of fees as a
screening device. Thus a fraction of patents in the first quality decile before and after the
PLAA could be patents for which the threshold model did not apply. This conclusion
supports the staged nature of the schedule of fees, which is characterized but entry fees in the
form of application and grant fees and maintenance fees once the patent is granted (Cornelli
an Schankerman, 1999; Scotchmer, 1999). However, the result that a non-trivial proportion of
low-quality patents was filtered out suggests that at least some firms do have some definite
knowledge about the potential importance of their inventions early on.
The approach adopted in this paper is similar in spirit to a quantile regression. The
difference is that it does not estimate the value of the first decile for each group but the
proportion of patents by each group that lie in the first decile of a reference group (locals
before the fee increase). Quantile regressions give qualitatively similar conclusions, namely
qualified evidence of increase in quality and strong evidence of increase in value (not
reported). However, they are more difficult to interpret in economic terms.

The average treatment effect can hide important disparities across patentees. In
particular, we suspect that the intensity of the response function varies with the size of the
patent portfolio held by patentees. To test this hypothesis, we estimate the DiD regression
model on four subsamples constructed according to the number of patents held by assignees
in the pre-reform period: patents by assignees that had no more than 5 patents; patents by
assignees with 6 to 20 patents; patents by assignees with 21 to 100 patents; and patents by
assignees with a portfolio size greater than 100 patents. Table 5 only reports the treatment
effects for ease of readability.

The intensity of trimming with respect to patent quality is particularly strong for the
very low quality patents (first decile) of large to very large patent owners (more than 20
patents in the study period). The fee increase had no effect on the quality of patents by small
and medium patent owners. Regarding the value indicator, the reform had virtually no impact
for small and very large patent owners. It had the largest effect for medium and large owners.
4.3 Confounding factors
An important assumption of the DiD regression model is that the quality of patents by locals
follows the same trend in the pre-treatment period as that of patents by foreign assignees (the
so-called ‘parallel-trend assumption’). It ensures that the control group provides an adequate
basis for the counterfactual case. We briefly discuss two tests that we performed in order to
ensure that the assumption holds, although we do not report them for the sake of brevity.
First, we have tested for the presence of lag effects in the DiD regression model by including
dummy variables that take the value 1 for patents assigned to locals and filed in the few
months preceding the reform and 0 otherwise. Significant coefficients typically provide
evidence that the trend of the treatment group started departing from that of the control group
before the reform. Coefficients associated with the various lag variables were largely not
statistically different from zero, suggesting no significant change in trend before the reform.
Second, we have also performed a placebo DiD before the reform. The time window used for
the placebo test goes from January 1981 to August 1982 and the variable post takes the value
1 for patents filed on or after November 1, 1981. The interaction term was not significantly
different from zero, providing additional evidence that controls and treatments did not differ
before the reform.
The DiD setting does not follow conventional textbook practice because both
treatments and controls were subject to a policy change. Yet, this particular setting does not
compromise the validity of the findings: as long as the intensity of the behavioral response to
16
	  

a change in fees differs between groups, this setting provides information about whether
patent fees affect quality. However, since the control group was also subject to a change in
fees, the treatment effect may underestimate the true effect on quality. In order to gauge the
sensitivity of the results to the control group we have estimated the DiD regression model
using control patents that were probably among the least sensitive to fees, namely patents by
German applicants.9 Treatment effects were of similar magnitude.
The patent landscape was also changed in 1982 by the creation of the Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC) and its assignment as the sole U.S. appeals court in
patent cases. This change eventually affected incentives to apply for patents by lowering the
standards for patentability and increasing the value of patent protection. But these changes do
not undermine our results because: (1) the ultimate effects of the CAFC on patent practice
and enforcement were not seen until at least 1985 (Bender et al., 1986; Strawbridge et al.,
1987); and (2) once these effects were known, the effect was to increase rather than decrease
the incentive to apply for low-quality patents (Hall, 2005; Quillen, 2006)—so if the effect of
the CAFC was somehow anticipated during our data period that would cause a conservative
bias in our estimates of the impact of the fee change.10
Finally, one may question whether the results do not reflect intertemporal substitution
rather than a genuine weeding out effect. The main regression model excludes patents filed
the month directly before and after the PLAA, where intertemporal substitution is most likely
to occur. We have also estimated the regression model on a sample that excludes patents filed
two months before and after the reform, with very similar results (not reported). While it
seems possible that patentees may rush to file applications before the fee increase, it seems
unlikely that they will be able to rush by more than two months in light of the short R&D
gestation lag. More generally, results of the specification with lags and the placebo test
discussed above indicate that the trends between groups started changing only after the
reform, which further suggests the presence of a genuine effect.
5. Concluding remarks
This paper investigates the effect of the U.S. Patent Law Amendment Act of 1982 (which
involved a substantial increase in patenting costs) on the quality of patents at the USPTO.
The empirical analysis suggests a positive answer to the question asked in the title of the

The group of U.S. second filings granted to German applicants is a strong control group because the German
patent system is usually seen as a high-quality system involving a high inventive step (see, for example, Michel
and Bettels, 2001, p. 189). In addition, having been substantially changed in 1976 (Mueller and Wegner, 1977),
German patent law did not undergo any major reform in the early 1980s. Finally, the total patenting cost for
German applicants willing to protect an invention in the United States is much higher than that for U.S.
applicants. Helfgott (1993) estimated that the cost of translating a typical patent application from German to
English was $2,000 in 1992, equivalent to $ 1,400 in 1983 using the CPI deflator (i.e., more expensive than U.S.
attorneys’ fees and application fees combined).

Atkinson et al. (2009) provide some evidence that forum-shopping practice may have anticipated the
formation of the CAFC.

paper. It presents evidence that applications perceived to be weaker were weeded out. Results
from a series of DiD regressions indicate that 14 per cent of patents in the lowest quality
decile were filtered out. The figure reaches 15 per cent for patents in the lowest value decile
and 19 per cent for patents in the lowest value quintile. However, the increase in quality was
not constant across the board. The effect was particularly strong for the largest patentees.
We note that our analysis is guided by but not embedded in a behavioral model of the
firm and its environment. As such, the analysis is subject to Lucas’ critique (Lucas, 1976),
meaning that the results may have limited predictive power. The legal environment has
changed since the early 1980s, and the increased emphasis on the alternative, strategic uses of
patents has modified patenting practices. It would be erroneous to directly transpose the
estimates to the current situation. However, the qualitative message of the empirical analysis
is likely to remain: higher patent fees reduce applications for low-quality patents
disproportionately.
The study has important implications for intellectual property policy. A fee reform,
much like any tax reform, must be studied from three perspectives: revenues, efficiency, and
equity. It is well established empirically that an increase in fees will increase the total
revenues collected by patent offices because the price elasticity of demand for patents is
lower than unity. In the traditional tax context, this revenue benefit must be balanced against
an assumed efficiency loss associated with reducing quantities below their supposedly
optimal level. But for the reasons discussed in the introduction, to the extent that the
reduction in patent applications effectively screens out low-quality patents, the resulting
reduction in processing time, and increase in the average quality of patents, likely improves
the overall functioning of the patent system. Regarding the equity dimension, the results
presented in this paper show that the fee increase had no impact on the quality (to a large
extent) and value (to some extent) of patents by small patentees. The intensity of trimming
with respect to patent quality was particularly strong for the very low quality patents of large
to very large patent owners, which is a desirable policy outcome as current concern about low
quality largely targets this group.
Further work is needed to understand the net welfare gains of an increase in fees.
While the benefits are fairly obvious—especially in today’s context of low quality—the costs
are more difficult to evaluate. A possible cost of dearer patents is the overall reduction of the
return to patenting and hence a potential reduction of the incentives to innovate. (Note that
for high-quality applications that are undeterred by higher fees, the net benefit of patenting is
still reduced.) There are, however, reasons to believe that this effect is negligible. The price
elasticity of demand for patents is inelastic (de Rassenfosse and van Pottelsberghe, 2012) and
the decision to invest in inventive activities should be a fortiori even less sensitive to patent
fees. Empirical evidence by Nicholas (2011) supports this view. The author shows that a
dramatic lowering of patent filing fees in Britain in 1883 had no effect on the level of
18
	  

innovation of the British economy. Other side effects of higher fees could include a higher
prevalence of secrecy, and the exclusion of cash-poor players. But these risks seem modest in
the current context of concerns about patent quality, large backlogs and financial
vulnerability of patent offices, suggesting that the option of fee increases should be
considered seriously.

Data Appendix
Data sources
The central data source is the October 2012 edition of Patstat, the worldwide patent statistical
database by the European Patent Office (EPO). It provides a listing of all patents granted by
the USPTO around the time of the reform.11 We include all utility patents filed 21 months
before and after the reform, that is, from January 1, 1981 to June 30, 1984. There are 223,393
such patent documents. These patent documents all correspond to granted patents, because
the USPTO at that time did not publish patent applications that were rejected. The quality
indicators related to the number of citations, the number of claims and the family size are
computed from Patstat. Information on the number of claims is missing for 545 patents. The
data is complemented with the USPTO Patent Maintenance Fee Events (PMFE) database in
order to compute the number of renewals. A total of 350 patents could not be matched with
the USPTO PMFE database. The full sample contains 222,434 patents with all quality
indicators available.
A second sample is used for the econometric analysis. A total of 143 patents are
excluded from the sample due to missing IPC codes. The DiD sample also excludes 50,496
patents by small entities. Although the reform led to an increase in fees for all patentees, the
increase was much smaller for assignees that could claim the small entity fee reduction. Thus,
excluding patents assigned to small entities allows for an intensity of treatment that is
homogenous across all local applicants. Second, patents in the control group are
overwhelmingly owned by large entities, and the exclusion of patents by small entities
therefore increases the homogeneity between treatments and controls. Finally, this filter leads
to the exclusion of university-owned patents, thereby mitigating the potential effect of the
Bayh-Dole Act. The treatment group is composed of priority filings by local applicants, and
the control group is composed of second filings by foreign applicants. The DID sample
therefore excludes 38,577 second filings by local applicants and 3,547 priority filings by
foreign applicants. Finally, we keep firms active both before and after the PLAA in order to
increase homogeneity between pre and post samples. Table A-1 provides an overview of
samples’ composition.
The data is also complemented with the OECD Applicant Harmonized Name (HAN)
data table, which provides a clean listing of assignees (used for computing patent portfolio
size).

Construction of patent quality indicators
The number of citations received by a patent is computed by counting the number of times
the patent document was cited ten years after grant. We consider only citations from USPTO
patents; we exclude citations from patents filed in other jurisdictions. The indicator is subject
to an inflation bias because the number of citing patents increases over time, with the
growing number of patent applications.
The number of claims is directly available from Patstat and corresponds to the number
of claims listed in the publication associated with the first granted document.
The size of the patent family is computed by counting the number of jurisdictions
covered by the patent documents in the same DOCDB family. The DOCDB family is
constructed by examiners and covers patent documents protecting the same technical content.
See Martínez (2011) for additional information on patent families.
The number of renewals is computed from the USPTO PMFE database. Every patent
that has expired is associated with a code EPX. and a corresponding expiration date in the
database. Patents that are not associated with an expiration code were maintained to full term
(17 years after grant at that time).
