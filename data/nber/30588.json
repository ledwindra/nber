    "abstract": "\n\nWe investigate whether Donald Trump's \"Chinese Virus\" tweets contributed to the rise of anti-Asian incidents. We find that the number of incidents spiked following Trump\u2019s initial \u201cChinese Virus\u201d tweets and the subsequent dramatic rise in internet search activity for the phrase. Difference-in-differences and event-study analyses leveraging spatial variation indicate that this spike in anti-Asian incidents was significantly more pronounced in counties that supported Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election relative to those that supported Hillary Clinton. We estimate that anti-Asian incidents spiked by 4000 percent in Trump-supporting counties, over and above the spike observed in Clinton-supporting counties.\n\n",
