ABSTRACT
We document a change in household shopping behavior during the Great Recession. Households purchased
more on sale, larger sizes and generic products, increased coupon usage, and shopping at discount
stores. We estimate that the returns to these shopping activities declined during the recession and therefore
this behavior implies a signicant decrease in households’ opportunity cost of time. Using the estimated
cost of time and time use data, we estimate a high elasticity of substitution between market expenditure
and time spent on non-market work. We nd that households smooth a sizable fraction of consumption
by varying their time allocation during recessions.

Introduction

During recessions, some consumers are faced with lower wealth and declines in income but
have more free time. One way to deal with these is to spend more time on non-market work,
such as home production and shopping. For example, consumers can lower their expenditure
by buying during sales, using coupons, substituting to cheaper brands, buying in bulk, and
shopping at discount stores. All of these activities can reduce food expenditures, but require
more shopping time and effort. In this paper, we show that indeed consumers changed their
shopping behavior during the Great Recession. We then estimate the change in the returns to
these behaviors and compute the implied substitution between time and goods expenditure in
home production. Finally, we ask to what extent are households able to smooth consumption
relative to market expenditures by varying their time use during recessions? Our estimates
are important for interpreting the co-movement of aggregate variables over the business cycle,
and for computing the welfare costs of recessions.
An important component of many macroeconomic models is how individuals substitute
between time and market goods. For instance, Benhabib, Rogerson and Wright (1991) and
Greenwood and Hercowitz (1991) propose home production models that incorporate substitution between market and non-market work. In these models, the co-movement between
expenditure and employment over the business cycle depends on the willingness of households to substitute between market work, non-market work, and expenditure. However, most
estimates of the elasticity of substitution used in these models are based on data from nonrecession periods. It is possible that, like returns to market work, the returns to non-market
work also change during recessions.
Aguiar, Hurst and Karabarbounis (2013), a notable exception to the above mentioned
studies, use the American Time Use Survey to show that households reallocated lost labor
market hours towards non-market work, including shopping, during the Great Recession.
Our first contribution in this paper is to examine how this reallocation of time actually
translates to lower prices. We use data from the Nielsen Homescan dataset to document how
households changed their shopping intensity. The households in our data record their food
purchases, the prices paid, and when and where the product was purchased. Each household
is in the data set for several years. In total, we have 112,837 households documenting their
food purchases from 2004 to 2010.
We document changes in shopping behavior across five key activities during the recent

1

recession: purchases of sale items, coupon usage, buying generic products and large sized
items, and shopping at discount (Big Box). While past studies have focused on purchases of
sale items and store-switching ,1 we show that adjustments to other shopping activities (using
coupons, buying generic and large sized items) also rose noticeably during the recession, and
are therefore important for the measurement of inflation and consumption. In fact, all
activities rose as a share of total household expenditure during 2008-2010 compared to prerecession trends. The increase is more pronounced in regions that experienced a larger rise
in unemployment, suggesting that the rise in shopping intensity is cyclical. We find that the
increase in shopping intensity is pervasive across various household demographics, including
age, income, and employment status.
Next we ask whether the rise in shopping intensity is driven by an increase in the returns
to shopping. For each household, we compute the ratio of the price they paid for the basket
of goods purchased, and the cost of the same basket if “average” market prices were paid
instead. We then regress this ratio on shopping intensity in our five different activities
to measure the returns to shopping, controlling for omitted variables in a couple of ways.
We find that these shopping activities lower the price paid by households - for example,
consumers who use more coupons pay a lower price. However, we find that the return to
shopping declined during the recent recession, even as shopping intensity increased. Our
preferred estimates suggest that in 2008-2010 relative to 2004-2007, the returns were around
1-2 percentage points lower for purchases of sale items, using a coupon, buying generic
products, purchasing large sized items, and shopping at Big Box stores.
The increase in shopping intensity, coupled with the decrease in returns to shopping,
implies a decline in households’ opportunity cost of time. This motivates the last step of
our analysis, where we use data on prices and quantities to estimate parameters of a home
production function. Using a home production model, we recover households’ cost of time,
and the elasticity of substitution between time and market goods. Specifically, we exploit
the fact that at the optimum, households equate the marginal return from shopping to their
opportunity cost of time.
We estimate that households’ opportunity cost of time declined by 14-26 percent over
2008-2010. The decline in cost of time is consistent with the increase in time spent on
non-market work during recessions, which has been documented using time use data in
Aguiar, Hurst and Karabarbounis (2013). Using the estimated opportunity cost of time and

price data, we recover a point estimate of 1.7 for the elasticity of substitution between time
and market goods in home production, with a standard error of 0.5. This implies a high
elasticity of substitution between the home sector and the market sector, which is supportive
of parameters used in existing home production models.2
Our estimated home production function allows us to address two key questions related to
the recent recession. First, we ask whether shocks to the non-market sector were important
drivers of the decline in aggregate expenditure and increase in time spent on non-market
work over 2008-2010. Answering this question matters for understanding the propagation
mechanisms behind the recent recession. We find that the elasticity between expenditure
on market goods and time spent on home production is not statistically different between
the pre-recession and recession periods, which implies that the recession was not driven by
shocks to the non-market sector.
Second, we use our estimated home production function to examine the ability of households to smooth consumption over time by varying their time allocation. While existing
studies focus on consumption smoothing via formal and informal mechanisms, in this paper
we document the importance of a different mechanism: that is, the intra-temporal allocation of time towards non-market work.3 Our contribution is to show that intra-temporal
allocation of time is as important for consumption smoothing as other more standard forms
of smoothing in the face of large wealth and income declines. Specifically, we estimate that
consumption declined by 60 percent less than the fall in market expenditure due to increased
home production and time spent shopping during the recession. Our findings complement a
recent study by Stroebel and Vavra (2015) who document large responses in shopping activity and prices paid to shifts in household wealth. However, they focus on the implications
for firm price setting, while we analyze measurement of household consumption.
Our work contributes to various strands of the literature. First, our work relates to recent
studies that use the American Time Use Survey to understand how the allocation of time
evolves over the business cycle. Aguiar, Hurst and Karabarbounis (2013), for instance, have
shown that roughly 30 percent of the lost labor hours are reallocated towards non-market
2

See for example, Benhabib, Rogerson and Wright (1991), Greenwood and Hercowitz (1991), Chang and

Schorfheide (2003), and Aguiar and Hurst (2007).

Examples of formal mechanisms to smooth consumption include savings, private and public insurance.
An example of an informal consumption smoothing mechanism is the labor supply of the second worker in
the family. See for example, Kaplan (2012), Blundell, Pistaferri and Saporta-Eksten (2012), and Heathcote,
Storesletten and Violante (2009).

work. Our work provides a natural extension of these studies by explicitly quantifying the
extent of consumption smoothing that arises from the time reallocation, and the implied
decline in the opportunity cost of time and returns to shopping.
Our work also relates to a growing literature that examines behavior in general, and
shopping behavior specifically, during the Great Recession. For example, Coibion, Gorodnichenko and Hong (2012) and Kaplan and Menzio (2014) study shopping behavior and
prices during the Great Recession. Their focus, is primarily on search across stores, while
we study shopping behavior more broadly. Griffith, OConnell and Smith (2014) look at
shopping behavior in the UK during the great recession but focus primarily on the calorie
and nutritional implications.
This paper also contributes towards the literature on inflation. For instance, Shapiro and
Wilcox (1996) and the Boskin Commission report (1996) show that store-substitution can
cause biases in the measurement of consumer inflation, while Griffith et al. (2009) documents
the reduction in effective prices paid from a range of shopping activities which may not be
fully reflected in a fixed-weight inflation index. More recently, studies such as Chevalier and
Kashyap (2011) and Coibion, Gorodnichenko and Hong (2012) show that the gap between
effective prices paid and posted prices can vary over time as households change their shopping
effort. A recent study by Beraja, Hurst and Ospina (2015) also documents that weaker labor
markets in the U.S. experienced lower price growth during the recent recession. We differ
from these studies by considering the effect of a broader set of shopping activities.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe our data and
in Section 3, we display trends in shopping characteristics over the cycle. In Section 4, we
present our estimates of the returns to shopping during the recent recession. In Section 5,
we present a formal home production model and use it to derive the estimation strategy for
two key model parameters: 1) the price of time, and 2) the elasticity of substitution between
market goods and home production. In Section 6, we provide evidence of robustness of our
findings under a range of alternative assumptions. We conclude in Section 7.

Data and Variable Definitions

The data we use comes from the Nielsen Homescan database.4 The dataset includes information on all food purchased and brought into the home by a large number of households
over 2004-2010 from 52 geographically dispersed markets (each roughly corresponding to a
Metropolitan Statistical Area) and nine regional areas. Households in the sample are recruited by Nielsen via mail and online. Nielsen offers incentives to households to join and
remain active in reporting transactions. These incentives include monthly prize drawings,
gift points and sweepstakes. To ensure the quality of data, Nielsen filters out households
who do not regularly report their transactions, and regularly adds new households to the
panel to replace households who leave the sample. In doing so, Nielsen maintains a national
representative sample.
Participating households record the data using hand-held scanners at home. The households record the store where the product was purchased, the date and quantity purchased
at the Universal Product Code (UPC) level. For each UPC, the data contains information
on the product characteristics, including brand, size and packaging. Prices come from one
of two sources. If the store where the product was purchased is one that reports prices to
Nielsen as part of their store-level survey, then Nielsen obtains the price from the store data.
Nielsen also reports the price paid which can include panelist-reported prices or Nielsenascribed prices if the panelist does not, or is not required to, enter a price. In addition,
households record whether the purchased item involved one of four types of deals: (i) store
feature, (ii) store coupon, (iii) manufacturer coupon, (iv) any other deal. In the cases where
a coupon was used, the household records its value.5
Our version of the Nielsen Homescan data has approximately 325 million household
purchase transactions over 2004 to 2010, where a transaction is defined at a UPC level. In
total, we use data from 112,907 households who report purchases for at least 10 months.
These households on average report data over 32 consecutive months. The dataset contains
demographic information about the household panelist, which are updated annually. These

USDA/ERS and Northwestern University. Similar data are available for academic research from the KiltsNielsen Data Center. See http://research.chicagobooth.edu/marketing/databases for details.

One concern with self-reported data is that the data may be recorded with error. However, Einav,
Leibtag and Nevo (2010) compare the self-reported data in Homescan with data from cash registers and
conclude that the reporting error is of similar magnitude to that found in commonly used economic data
sets.

region of residency, employment status, family composition and household income.
We focus on five aspects of shopping behavior: purchases of sale items, coupon use, buying
generic products, purchases of large size items (which are typically cheaper per ounce), and
shopping at discount (Big Box) stores. These five activities are defined as follows.

Sale An item is defined as being on sale if the household recorded that the item purchased
involved a deal.

Coupon Use An item is defined as involving coupon usage if the household recorded that
item purchased involved using either a store coupon or a manufacturer coupon.

Generic Product An item is identified as a ‘generic product’ based on the brand code
associated with the UPC.

Large Size Items To define large sized items, we follow Griffith et al. (2009) and rank by
size all UPCs in our data within a narrowly defined category. An item is defined as ‘large’
if the size of the item is in the upper two quantiles of this distribution, i.e., in the top 40
percent of UPCs in the category, ranked by product size.

Big Box store purchase The data identifies the retailer channel that the item was purchased from. Big Box stores are identified as mass merchandise stores, super-centers, and
club stores.
For each of these measures, we define shopping intensity as the fraction of household
expenditure in each month that comes from each activity. For example, when looking at
coupons, we ask in each month what fraction of purchases were made with a coupon. We
then seasonally adjust the data at a monthly level. For robustness, we also examined the
fraction of purchases and find qualitatively similar results in terms of trends reported in the
following section.
Starting in 2007 and continuing to 2008-09, Nielsen introduced a new method of capturing deals on newer devices given to incoming panelists. We verify in two ways that our
findings are not affected by this change. First, we include household fixed effects in all of our
6

calculations. Since the change only affects new panelists that join after 2006, the household
fixed effect captures any differences causes by the new methodology. Second, we redid our
analysis with only the consumers that were already in the sample prior to 2007, and hence
were unaffected by the change in methodology. We find similar results to our calculations
that use the entire sample and include household fixed effects.

3

Change in Shopping Patterns Over the Cycle

We start by examining shopping patterns. We focus on the five aspects of shopping behavior
defined in the previous section: purchases of sale items, coupon use, buying generic products,
purchasing large size items, and shopping at Big Box stores. We document the fraction of
expenditure involving various shopping activities and show how the patterns changed during
the Great Recession.
To aid in presentation, we display our results graphically.6 We report three types of
results in the figures below. In all cases, we regress the seasonally-adjusted fraction of overall
expenditure for each shopping activity by each household in each month on a household
fixed effect (to control for differences across households) and a time trend. We examine
three different time trends. First, we describe the data non-parametrically, i.e., we allow for
month-year fixed effects. The coefficients on the month-year effects give a non-parametric
estimate of the average fraction of expenditure per the month accounted for by the particular
shopping activity. To highlight the trend over the sample period, we also calculate cubic
and linear spline trends. The cubic trend is estimated from a regression with a cubic trend,
instead of month-year fixed effects. The linear spline series is estimated using two break
points: the first in December 2007, at the official start of the Great Recession as dated by
the NBER; and the second in June 2009, at the end of the NBER recession date.
Figures 2-5 display estimates of the fraction of household expenditures which involve
purchases of sale items, coupon usage, buying generic items, buying large-sized items, and
shopping at Big Box stores, respectively. The behaviors for sales, coupons, generic and
large-sized items, displayed in Figures 2-4, follow similar patterns. Prior to the recession,
purchases of items on sale, coupon usage, purchases of generic products, and purchases of
large items were either stable or declining as a share of total expenditure. This contrasts
6

To avoid clutter in the graphs, we do not present confidence intervals around the estimates. Given the

large number of observations the confidence intervals are small and are available upon request.

Figure 1: Purchases of Sale Items (Fraction of household expenditure)
with a distinct increase in each of these shopping activities during the recession. Over
the recession, these shopping activities each increased by 1.5-2.0 percentage points of total
household expenditure. The breaks in the trend are statistically significant and are reported
in the first panel of Table 1. These trends closely follow the movement in the aggregate
unemployment rate (dashed line in Figures 2-4).
On the other hand, expenditure at Big Box stores, displayed in Figure 5, exhibits a
somewhat different pattern. In the pre-recession period, the share of expenditure made at
Big Box stores was rising, in large part due to the expansion and growth of Wal-Mart.
During 2008-2010, the fraction of expenditure in Big Box stores continued to rise, although
at a slower rate than the pre-recession period. As we show in Appendix A Figure 7, the
same pattern is observed if we look at other measures of store search intensity, such as the
share of expenditure in the household’s main store (ranked by spending in that store), their
top two stores, their top three stores, and a Herfindahl index of household expenditure by
store. Consistent with Kaplan and Menzio (2014), our measures of store search intensity
show that households consolidated their search within a smaller number of stores during the
recession, which included the Big Box stores.
The increase in shopping intensity during the recession observed in the graphs may reflect business cycle variation, but may also reflect low-frequency structural changes. The

prevalence of structural trends is particularly relevant for the shopping patterns at Big Box
stores, where the trend may reflect the pre-recession expansion of Wal-Mart and its subsequent slow-down in new store openings. The short time frame of our data prevents us from
using standard statistical methods to detrend the time series data to examine the business
cycle variation. Therefore to isolate the low frequency trends from potential business cyclical
variation, we further examine county-level variation in shopping patterns. Using variation
across counties allows us to control for common low-frequency trends. We then relate the
county-level shopping patterns with local employment conditions to examine business cycle
patterns, as it is a measure that is closely correlated with aggregate output during the Great
Recession.7 Specifically, we estimate for each shopping activity the following equation:
yitk = α0k + α1k U Rc(i)t + α2k t + α3k t · λ2007 + α4k t · λ2009 + λ2007 + λ2009 + λi + kit

(1)

where yitk is the seasonally-adjusted average fraction of expenditure for household i in month
k
t from shopping activity k, and U Rc(i)t
denotes the unemployment rate in county c(i) where

household i resides. As in Figures 2-5, the regression specification includes linear splines with
two breaks (at December 2007 and June 2009) to control for possible linear low-frequency
trends that may be occurring over the recession period. This is given by the interaction of
the trend t with indicator functions λ2007 and λ2009 , which equal 1 if t is after December 2007
and after June 2009, respectively. We also control for household fixed effects, denoted by λi
respectively; and kit is the random error term.
The coefficients for the time trend terms are statistically significant and reported in
the first panel of Table 1. The second panel of Table 1 displays the coefficients for the
linear splines and for unemployment. The patterns in the trend coefficients are very similar
to the results in the first panel, which do not control for the county-level unemployment
rate. The coefficients on unemployment are positive and statistically significant for each
of the shopping activities. This implies that counties that experienced a greater rise in
unemployment also on average had more pronounced increases in shopping activities. For
instance, the unemployment rate coefficient in column (I) implies that a one percentage point
increase in the unemployment rate increases the fraction of expenditure purchased on sale
by 11.37 basis points. The positive correlation with the level of unemployment suggests that

The approach of using geographic variation to identify changes in household behavior related to the

business cycle has also been used in recent studies including Aguiar, Hurst and Karabarbounis (2013) and
Mian and Sufi (2010).

Note: For ease of readability, the time-trend coefficients and standard errors (in parentheses) are multiplied
by 10, 000. Note, the unemployment coefficients are not multiplied by 10, 000. The coefficients on the
unemployment rate variable gives the basis point change in the share of expenditure with the shopping
characteristic (for example, buying on sales) given a 1 percentage point change in the unemployment rate.
Columns (I)-(V) of the first segment of the table shows estimates from regressing the fraction of each activity
on a linear spline with breaks at Dec-2007 and June-2009, controlling for household fixed effects. Each column
corresponds to a different regression, varying by shopping activity. These estimates underlie the linear spline
line for Figures 1-5. The second segment of the table shows estimates from the regressions of equation (1).
These regressions include household and county fixed effects, which are not reported in the table. In total,
there are 3,580,610 household-month observations.

12

the shift in shopping patterns over 2008-2010, which we observed in Figures 2-4, are indeed
related to business cycle factors.8
We note that the coefficient on the unemployment rate for the regression of shopping at
Big Box stores (column V) is positive and statistically significant, consistent with the other
shopping activities (columns I-IV). This implies that there does indeed exist a correlation
between declines in economic activity and shopping at Big Box stores, even though this is
difficult to see graphically in Figure 5 since the graph also captures low-frequency structural
trends.
We also directly estimated the change in each of the shopping activities upon unemployment. Specifically, we regressed the shopping activities on an indicator variable which
equals one if the consumer was “non-employed”. We exclude those households aged over
65, to focus those who are likely still in the labor force. We include household and time
fixed effects. Consistent with the cross-county regressions, we find that the coefficient on
the “non-employed” indicator variable for each of the activities is positive and statistically
significant for buying on sale, coupon usage, purchasing generic items and shopping at Big
Box stores.

Change in the Returns to Shopping

In the previous section, we documented that the fraction of expenditure from different shopping activities increased during the Great Recession. In this section, we estimate the change,
if any, in the return to these shopping activities. We follow the approach of Aguiar and Hurst
(2007) and compute for each household, in each month, the ratio of actual expenditure to
the expenditure for the same basket had the household paid average prices. As we describe
below, we compute average prices in a variety of ways. We then regress this price index
of sorts on measures of shopping activity, as well as other controls such as household fixed
effects. We, therefore, are asking how much did a consumer save by shopping, and more
importantly did the saving, or return, change during the Great Recession.9
8

Our results are consistent with Aguiar, Hurst and Karabarbounis (2013), who use data from the Amer-

ican Time Use Survey to show that households increased their time spent on non-market work, including
shopping, during the recent recession. A recent study by Stroebel and Vavra (2015) also show a correlation
between house prices and shopping activities.
9
An alternative approach, used by Griffith et al. (2009), is to regress transaction-level prices, rather
than a monthly price index, on the shopping activity. The theory we present below is that of an aggregated

13

Before discussing the details of implementation we want to highlight a couple of key
challenges we face in this exercise: (i) controlling for quality changes, and (ii) interpreting
the coefficients as returns to shopping. We describe briefly each of these issues and how we
address them in our estimation.
There are two somewhat separate issues in controlling for quality differences. First,
when we compute the “average price” a consumer would have paid, we want to make sure
we are controlling for quality differences. For example, a consumer might pay less but buy a
lower quality good (say a generic product versus a branded product). We address this issue
by computing the average price over a variety of product definitions. A narrower product
definition might better control for quality, but risks missing avenues of potential savings.
Broader product groupings will capture substitution across a wider array of items, but may
potentially overstate quality-adjusted price savings if the items within the group differ in
quality. The product definitions we use are discussed in more detail below.
Second, by holding the basket constant, between actual expenditure and expenditure
computed using average prices, we potentially face a substitution bias. To address this
we repeat the calculations using average market quantity weights, rather than householdspecific quantity weights. As we explain below, since the quantity weights used to compute
the price index are not household-specific, any changes over time in the price index for a
given household, will not reflect quality differences in their bundle relative to the rest of the
market.10
A separate issue we need to deal with is the measurement of shopping. In the regressions
below we will use the fraction of items bought, say, on sale as a measure of shopping. The
issue is that this measure could change even if the shopping activity does not, because
of supply side behavior. For example, suppose that firms offer more frequent sales, then
even without an increase in shopping intensity the household will buy more on sale and
the increase in shopping activity would be overly attributed to greater consumer shopping
intensity.
commodity. We therefore need the effects of shopping activities on the price of this aggregate commodity,
which is better reflected in the price index specification. In contrast, the transaction-level regression would
need to be weighted in order to provide the appropriate results. For example, we may want to give a higher
weight to items that account for a larger fraction of a household’s expenditure basket. This weight is thus
potentially household specific. Coupled with the large size of the data, this quickly becomes intractable.
10
Note that in a sense, the quality substitution bias that arises is similar to the bias that arises when
using Laspeyres indices to measure inflation.

14

We address this in a couple of ways. First, we note that the price index we compute
directly addresses these concerns since we compare actual expenditure to the expenditure
the household would have paid at the average price in the market. Thus, supply-side effects
that are common across households within the market are netted out in the price index.
Indeed, we show that our results are robust to different market definitions. Second, in the
modeling section we show how we can deal with a change in the relationship between our
measure of shopping activity and the theoretical shopping intensity.
Price index with household-specific weights
Denote the price paid for good j (at a UPC level) on shopping trip t by household h
h
. We compute a price index by comparing the
as phj,t , and the corresponding quantity as qj,t

actual expenditure to the expenditure that the household would have incurred if they had
instead paid the average price in the market, denoted by p̄j,m for item j in month m.
Specifically, we define a price index for the household in month m as the ratio of their
actual expenditure to the cost of the bundle at the average price

where J denotes the set of all UPCs belonging to product J, and D denotes the set of
all products. The index is then normalized by dividing by the average price index across
households within the month
phm ≡

H̃m

p̃hm
P

(3)

where H̃m denotes the total number of households in the sample in month m. This ensures
that the distribution of price indices across households is centered around 1 each month. An
index that is above 1 indicates that household h paid a higher average price for its basket of
goods in month m, while an index below 1 indicates that a lower average price was paid.
This price index deals with the two issues that we mentioned previously. First, because
we use a relative price index we control for shocks that are common across households
within the same market. Market-level shocks affect both the individual’s expenditure (the
numerator of equation 2) as well as the comparison expenditure at average market prices
(the denominator of equation 2). In the base analysis, we define the market at a nationallevel. Therefore the average price p̄j,t , is computed across all households at time t. In the
15

Section 6, as robustness, we also consider defining a market at a county-level (hence p̄j,m is
computed across all households in the county, excluding the individual j). We consider the
county-level definition to control for the possibility that there may be regional shocks.
To deal with potential differences in quality, the price index compares prices of items
within the same product group. To the extent that these items have the same quality, then
variations in the relative price index are not driven by quality differences. We consider four
different definitions of a product. In this section we define a product as: (i) a UPC, (ii) all
items with the same characteristics, or (iii) all items within a product module. In Section
6, as robustness, we define a product by splitting items within a product-module into two
further groupings of branded and generic products.
The first index we compute, as in Aguiar and Hurst (2007), the average price paid by
households for a particular UPC j

p̄j,m ≡

h
qj,t

X
P
h∈H,t∈m

h
h∈Hm ,t∈m qj,t

phj,t

(4)

where Hm denotes the set of all households in the sample in month m. This approach has
the advantage of controlling for the quality of the product purchased since it only considers
the price paid by other households for the same UPC. However, it does not account for the
savings that households can achieve by buying different sizes and different brands. It also
does not fully account for potential savings from shopping at Big Box stores since these
stores often carry different UPCs. Thus, this index will underestimate the total savings from
these shopping activities.
Therefore, we also consider a second index which defines a product as the set of items
that have the same characteristics. This controls for shifts in quality by comparing prices
of items with common characteristics (and hence of similar quality), while still capturing
some price savings that come from substituting across sizes and brands within the same
group (as in Kaplan and Menzio (2014)). The intuition behind grouping these items is
that they may have different UPCs, but are in fact close substitutes from the perspective
of buyers. The features given in the data that we consider for defining a product include:
“flavor”, “form”, “salt content”, “type”, and “style”. This approach is broader than the
UPC-specific definition. However, to the extent that items can have different characteristics
and similar overall quality, then the index will still understate the quality-adjusted price
savings, although to a lesser extent than the UPC-product definition.
16

Thus, we consider an even broader product definition using product modules, which
allows for substitution among brands as well as different sizes. Specifically, we calculate the
average per ounce price paid for item j of size sj by taking the average across all items of
the same size belonging to the product category J,
h

p̄j,m /sj ≡

h
k∈J,h∈Hm ,t∈m qk,t

P
k∈J,h∈H,t∈m

!
phk,t /sk

(5)

This average price is normalized by dividing by the size of the item to allow for comparison
across different sizes.
Defining a product at a product-module has the advantage of allowing for substitution
across sizes and brands of a large set of items within the product-module. We note that
this approach assumes all items within the product are substitutable and therefore does not
consider quality differences across items within the product module. So in a sense, it is the
other extreme from the UPC-level index: here we assume all items in a group are perfect
substitutes while before we assume they are not substitutes at all.
In Section 6, we consider an alternative index that controls for quality differences between
generic and non-generic products, and show that our results are robust to substitution between goods of different quality.
Price index with market weights
The second way that we control for quality is to consider an alternative relative price
index, where every consumer has the same quantity weight that is based on the market average quantity, rather than having a different quantity weight for each individual. Specifically,
we consider a second version of the price using average market quantity weights

P
h
J∈D
j∈J,t∈m pj,t q̄j,t
P

J∈D
j∈J,t∈m p̄j,m q̄j,t

The average market quantity weight is defined as

q̄j,t ≡ X̄jt /p̄j,m
where X̄jt is the average household expenditure on item j in month t.
Since quantity weights are the same for all households, any changes over time in this
price index for a given household do not reflect changes in their bundle, and hence are not
subject to quality bias due to household choices.

Returns to Shopping
To estimate the returns to the shopping activities, we regress the price indices we previously described on the fraction of items bought involving each shopping activity. Formally,
we estimate the following regression using household monthly observations

where phm is the price index (defined in the previous section) of the basket of goods purchased
h
by household h in month m; Zm
denotes the vector of household time-varying demograph-

ics, including age, employment status, and marital status of the head of household, and
household income; and λh controls for household time-invariant fixed effects. Since the regression includes household and recession period fixed effects, the error term in the regression
primarily includes random shocks to the relative price paid by the household.
h
denotes the fraction of items in the basket of goods purchased by
The variable fi,m

household h involving shopping activity i (which includes buying on sale, coupon usage,
buying large sizes, buying generic products and shopping at Big Box stores) in month m. Our
focus is on the interaction of these variable with the recession dummy variable 1(yr > 2007).11
The coefficients of interest are αi and βi , which give the sensitivity of price to each shopping
activity before and during the recession. A negative αi implies the shopping activity decreases
the price (hence has a positive return), while a positive βi implies a decline in returns during
the recession.
The first three columns of Table 2 show the regression results for equation (6) using
price indices that have household-specific weights. Each column uses a different price index
as the dependent variable, where the definition of a product varies across the indices. As
discussed above, we provide a range of product definitions to consider possible shifts in
quality associated with price savings. Specifically, column (I) is based on the relative price
index that defines a product at a UPC-level. Any price differentials are not due to changes
in the quality of items purchased by the households, since we compare the price of the same
UPC. However, the narrow definition also does not allow for possible substitution across
sizes and brands, which is a key way in which consumers reduce prices. To measure the
11

To simplify presentation we do not separate out the post-recession observations (i.e. the observations in

year 2010). In Section 6, we show that our findings are robust to excluding the post-recession observations.

18

importance of substitution across size and brand, Columns (II) and (III) considers broader
product definitions. The index in column (II) defines a product based on common item
characteristics, while column (III) defines a product at a product-module level.
Our results are qualitatively similar across the three indices. Specifically, we generally
find that shopping activities lower the price paid by the household. In the pre-recession
period, we estimate that the marginal price paid was reduced by 2-4 percent by buying on
sale, 31-33 percent by using a coupon, and 5-11 percent from shopping at a Big Box store.
The results for generic products and larger sizes are a bit different across the columns: the
results in Column (I) suggest these activities either do not have a meaningful economic effect
on the price paid, while the results in Columns (II) and (III) suggest that prices decreased
by 13-25 percent from buying a generic product, and 20-47 percent from buying large-sized
items. These differences are not surprising since, as we previously discussed, the first price
index essentially shuts down the savings channel created by buying larger sizes or generic
products because it compares the price paid for the same UPC. The direction and magnitude
of the effects is consistent with those found in the literature.12
The second result that we find is that the returns to each of the shopping activities
declined over the recession period. Specifically, we estimate that returns were approximately
2 percentage points lower (as seen in the estimated coefficients of the interaction of shopping
activity with a dummy for the recession period in Table 2). The estimated decline in returns,
coupled with the increase in shopping activities that we documented, implies that the shifts
in household shopping activities are associated with changes in their opportunity cost of
time, rather than a response to changes made by firms. This therefore motivates the next
section, where we use a household home production model to recover the change in the
households’ opportunity cost of time over the recession.
As we discussed above, one concern is that the estimates of returns may reflect differences
in changes in quality across households, or differential county-level supply-side shifts. In
Tables 2 (columns IV-VI) and 8 (in the appendix), we show that this is not the case. First,
we repeat the analysis using instead price indices that weight the prices paid by consumers
using a market-wide quantity weight. That is, we use the same quantity weight per productmonth pair for every consumer in the market. We can see that the results shown in columns
(IV-VI) of Table 2 are qualitatively similar to the corresponding columns (I)-(III). Therefore,
price differentials over time do not reflect differences in changes to the expenditure bundle
12

See for example, Aguiar and Hurst (2007), Griffith et al. (2009), and Kaplan and Menzio (2013, 2014).

19

across consumers.
Second, we repeat the analysis specifying a market at a county-level, instead of the entire
U.S. market. As we discussed above, we consider the county-level definition of a market
to control for the possibility that there may be regional differences in supply-side shifts.
Common within-county supply shifts are netted out by comparing the consumer’s paid price
to the average price paid by consumers within the same county since they affect both the
consumer’s price and the average price. The results are shown in Table 8 of the appendix.
The results are qualitatively similar to U.S-wide market averages (Table 2). These results
imply that the declines in returns to shopping are not driven by region-specific supply shocks.
Another potential concern is that the shopping intensity may be measured with error.
This could arise if for example there exists unobserved variation in shopping productivity
across consumer which varies over time which is correlated with the shopping activities.
Therefore, for robustness, we also examined the implied change in cost of time using number
of shopping trips as an alternative measure of shopping activity. Formally, we regress the
log of the price indices on the log of the total number of shopping trips in a month, as
well as UPC and household fixed effects. Following Aguiar and Hurst (2007), we use age
dummies to instrument for measurement issues associated with shopping time.13 Consistent
with our estimates of the individual shopping activities, we find that the average price paid
also declines when shopping trips increase, but that the level of price savings declined during
the recession period. Specifically, we estimate that doubling the number of shopping trips
reduced prices by 12 percent during the pre-recession period. In comparison, doubling the
number of shopping trips reduced prices by 9 percent during the recession period.
To sum up, in this section, we have shown that the price savings from engaging in the
individual shopping activities (buying on sale, using coupons, and so forth) declined during
the recession period. Moreover, as discussed above, these lower returns are consistent with
findings in the literature that retail sales did not become deeper or more frequent during the
recession period. Together, these findings imply that the pronounced increase in shopping
activity during the recession period, which we documented in the previous section, was not
being driven by higher returns to shopping. These findings motivate the next section where
13

As discussed in Aguiar and Hurst (2007), the age dummies are used as instruments for potential mea-

surement error in the shopping trips. These errors could arise, for example, if shopping time is measured
with error using the number of shopping trips. The use of age as an instrument is based on the premise that
the value of time varies over the life-cycle, which will in turn influence the shopping intensity, as argued in
Aguiar and Hurst (2007).

20

we explore the implications of these shopping activities for measuring households’ value of
time.

5

A Model of Home Production

In this section, we use the implications of the previous results for measuring households’
opportunity cost of time during the recent recession. We then recover the elasticity of substitution between time and market goods, a key parameter in the home production literature.
To do so, we describe a simple model of household cost minimization. The model is in the
spirit of Becker (1965), and subsequent time use and home production papers, including
Aguiar and Hurst (2007), Rupert, Rogerson and Wright (1995), Greenwood and Hercowitz
(1991) and others. The basic intuition behind these models of home production is that
individuals substitute between home produced and market produced goods based on their
relative price. Therefore, changes to the price of time and elasticity of substitution can be
recovered from changes to the returns to shopping and time use data.
In the previous section, we showed that households can reduce the price they pay by
varying the shopping activities of their basket. However, engaging in these shopping activities
also has a cost of time for the household. For example, shoppers may spend time searching
through newspapers to find coupons for a particular store. They may also spend time driving
to multiple stores to find the lowest price for a particular set of goods. This relationship
between shopping time and price can be summarized in a price function p(s, N), where
∂p/∂s < 0 and ∂ 2 p/∂s2 > 0. The time spent shopping is denoted by s. Other activities of
the shopping basket, not related to shopping time, that may influence price paid are denoted
by N. Total expenditure on the quantity Q of market goods purchased is given by
p(s, N)Q
We assume that the quantity of purchased market goods is converted into a consumption
good C using a home production technology K(h, Q). Households combine time h spent
on home production with the quantity of market goods Q to produce C, which enters the
household’s utility function. The home production function is assumed to be concave in h
and Q. Therefore, in addition to the shopping technology, households can also substitute
time for expenditures via their home production function.

The trade-off between time, market goods, and consumption goods can be summarized
in the household’s cost minimization problem

min p(st , Nt )Qt + µt (st + ht )

st ,ht ,Qt

(7)

subject to
K(ht , Qt ) = Ct
where µt is the opportunity cost of time in period t.14 We consider interior solutions to the
problem by making the usual monotonicity and concavity assumptions for the utility, price,
and home production functions.
The first-order condition for shopping time is given by

µt = −

∂pt
Qt
∂st

(8)

This condition implies that the shopping intensity s increases as the price of time µ falls,
holding the shopping bundle Q fixed. The opportunity cost of time can therefore be recovered
from the marginal return to shopping, holding Q fixed.
The first-order condition for home production is
µt =

where λt is the multiplier on the constraint. The first-order condition for Qt is

Note that the other choices made by the household are reflected in µt and Ct , including decisions about

labor supply and inter-temporal allocation of consumption.

23

Therefore, the first-order conditions from the household’s cost minimization problem
allows us to recover their opportunity cost of time, and the elasticity of substitution between
time and market goods in home production, which we estimate in the following section.

5.1

Implications for the Opportunity Cost of Time

Equation (8) implies that the opportunity cost of time can be estimated from the returns to
shopping, which can be rewritten as

−

∂pt
∂ ln pt
∂ ln pt ∂fit
Qt = −
· pt Qt = −
·
· Xt
∂st
∂st
∂fit
∂st

(12)

where s denotes the shopping time, fit denotes the share of items purchased with shopping
activity i, and Xt = pt Qt denotes total expenditure. The empirical counterpart of pt is the
composite price index (defined in Section 4) for one real composite food unit Q. To allow
for comparison across time and across households, the composite food unit Q is empirically
constructed as the average market value of goods, deflated by average market inflation

Qm =

X X

p̄j,m qj,t /Πt

J∈D j∈J,t∈m

where J denotes the set of all UPCs within D, the set of all product categories in the sample.
p̄j,m is the expenditure-weighted average price paid for item j, where the average is taken
across all households who made a purchase of j in month m. As described in Section 4, we
consider two different average price indices: one defined as the average price at a UPC-level,
and the second as the average price over all UPCs within a product category. Πt is the BLS
inflation index for food.
We have estimates of two of the terms in equation (12): ∂ ln pt /∂fit (the sensitivity of
price to each shopping activity which was estimated in Section 4), and Xt (the expenditure
per month from the Homescan data). To recover the cost of time, we also need to know
how the shopping activities change when the household engages in an extra unit of shopping
time, denoted by ∂fit /∂st . We assume that ∂fit /∂st is equal to γi /fit , where γi is a constant
parameter that varies with shopping activity i. In Section 6, we show that our results are
qualitatively robust to a range of alternative functional form assumptions about ∂fit /∂st .
The opportunity cost of time is given by
24

µt = −

∂ ln pt γi
·
· Xt
∂fit fit

(13)

which is equal for all shopping activities (coupon usage, purchase of sale items, purchase
of large items, buying generic products, and shopping at Big Box stores), because at the
optimum households equate the marginal return from each shopping activity. Thus, equation
(13) can be recovered using the shopping return estimates in Section 4 (Table 2), combined
with Homescan data for Xt and fit . Note that the scalar term γi drops out when we consider
the change in cost of time.
The change in the opportunity cost of time is given by

4µt+1 ≡

µt+1
∂ ln pt+1 /∂fi,t+1
fit
Xt+1
=
·
·
µt
∂ ln pt /∂fit
fi,t+1 Xt

(14)

We consider the change in the opportunity cost of time over two periods: t denotes the prerecession period of 2004-2007, and t+1 denotes the recession period 2008-2010. As discussed
above, the returns from each shopping activity imply the same change in opportunity cost
of time because at the optimum, households equate the marginal return from each activity.
However, suppose we measure the cost of time with some error it for each shopping activity
i. This implies that we observe
4µt+1 = 4µ̂t+1 + i,t+1

(15)

where 4µ̂t+1 is the actual change in opportunity cost of time. Combining equations (14)
and (15), taking logs and rearranging, we have

ln

∂ ln pi,t+1 /∂fi,t+1
fit
·
∂ ln pit /∂fit
fi,t+1


= β0 + ηi,t+1

(16)

where β0 = (− ln Xt+1 /Xt + ln 4µ̂t+1 ) is the constant which can estimated from a regression
of equation (16). We can therefore recover the underlying change in cost of time 4µ̂t+1 from
an estimate of β0 . The error term is denoted by ηi,t+1 .
To estimate equation (16), we construct the empirical counter-part of the dependent
variable from our estimates of ∂ ln pt /∂fit from Table 2. This is combined with an estimate
of the average fraction of expenditure for each shopping activity i, denoted fit , where the
average is computed from the Homescan data across all households-months within time
25

period t. To recover the cost of time 4µ̂, we also need − ln 4xt+1 , the log of the change in
total expenditure during the recession period. We construct the empirical counter-part for
this by taking the log of the average ratio of total expenditure during the recession period
relative to total expenditure during the pre-recession period, where the average is computed
from the Homescan data across all households in the sample. We compute the standard
errors around the opportunity cost of time based on the estimated standard errors of the
shopping returns from Table 2 for the coefficients of ∂ ln pi,t /∂fi,t .
Table 3 displays the estimated change in the opportunity cost of time during the recession.
The estimates in columns (I)-(III) are based on different estimates of the change in returns
to shopping from Section 4, which vary in their definition of a product (Table 2). Column
(I) is based on returns estimated from a price index that defines a product as a UPC, (II)
defines a product as all items with the same characteristics, and (III) defines a product as
an item within a product module. Column (IV) considers the case where we assume no
change in returns to shopping - hence, any difference in cost of time is due to changes in
shopping activities and expenditure. In Table (3), we observe a decline in the households’
opportunity cost of time of 20-26 percent during the recession. The decline in cost of time can
be decomposed into three factors (as seen in equation (14)): variation in shopping returns,
in shopping activities, and in expenditure.
Even if we assume there is no change in the returns to shopping during the recession, then
we would estimate a decline in the opportunity cost of time of 14 percent (Table 3, column
II). The reason why the cost of time still declines is because of increases in the shopping
activities. This implies that around half of the decline in the overall cost of time was due to
changes in shopping activities, while lower returns to shopping accounted for the remaining
half.
One potential concern about our measure of the opportunity cost is that the effect of
shopping time on returns may be measured with error. First, we note that in the case
that the measurement error is not time-varying, the error will affect the level estimate of
the cost of time but not the change in the cost of time which is what we are interested in
measuring in equation (16). In the case where the measurement error is time-varying, the
estimate of the cost of time will potentially be biased. However, we do not find evidence that
the measurement error is time-varying. We formally tested for a change in the relationship
between shopping activities f and shopping time s during the recession, and find that the

26

relationship is stable over the sample period.15
Another related concern is that the measured value of time may have changed as a
result of the distribution of posted prices faced by households, rather than demand-side
shifts in shopping intensity. However, as we discussed in the previous section, our price
indices explicitly controls for market supply-side shifts. This is because the relative price
index nets out common supply-side shocks since these shocks affect both the consumer’s
own expenditure as well as the comparison market-average expenditure. Thus, estimated
changes in returns using the index, and therefore the measured change in value of time,
reflect movements in consumer behavior and not supply-side changes to posted prices.
Our estimated change in opportunity cost of time is for the average consumer. These
changes of between 14-26 percent may seem large, but it is worth noting that they are consistent with the sizable declines in household income and wealth during the recent recession.
Specifically, real household median income declined by almost 10 percent over 2007-2012,
while real median household net wealth declined by 40 percent over 2007-2013 (from the
Survey of Consumer Finances). In the face of large declines in wealth, standard incomplete
markets models would predict a decline in household consumption. The decline in consumption would be associated with a fall in the value of time for households within the class of
utility functions that have non-separable preferences between consumption and leisure. Our
results here imply large effects of wealth and income on households’ value of leisure and
therefore their willingness to work over the business cycle.16

5.2

The Elasticity of Substitution Between Time and Market Goods

In this section, we use our estimated cost of time to derive the parameters of the home
production function, including the elasticity of substitution between time and market goods.
Models with home production typically rely on a high elasticity parameter in order to explain
a number of business cycle facts, such as the observed level of variation in aggregate output
15

Specifically, we merge on data on shopping-time from the American Time Use Survey, based on house-

hold demographics of age, marital status, gender and year. We then regress each of the average shopping
activity fit of demographic group i in month t on the square-root of the shopping time sit and the interaction
with the recession period. We find that the coefficient on the (square-root) shopping time does not change
significantly during the recession period for any of the shopping activities. This implies that the relationship
is not time-varying over the pre and current recession periods.
16
Our calculations complement recent studies, such as Stroebel and Vavra (2015), that examine the
relationship between price elasticity and wealth.

and market hours of labor over the business cycle.17 For example, Karabarbounis (2014)
shows that a model of home production that assumes an elasticity parameter close to 4 can
explain the observed variation over the business cycle in the wedge between marginal product
of labor and the marginal rate of substitution between consumption and leisure.
Previous estimates of the elasticity of substitution between time and market goods using micro data typically rely on cross-sectional household variation for identification. We
contribute to the literature in two ways. First, we estimate the elasticity by exploiting the
variation over the recession period, in addition to variation across household demographic
groups. The panel dimension of the data helps us in two ways. It allows us to control
for unobserved, time-invariant household heterogeneity with household-group fixed effects,
which could bias the estimates of the home production parameters. Moreover, we can allow
for variation in returns to non-market work (and therefore opportunity cost of time) across
households and time. Our second contribution is to use the time variation in the data to test
whether home production shocks were important drivers of the joint variation in time spent
on non-market work and expenditure on market goods observed during the recent recession.
17

Models that explain the joint variation in aggregate variables based on the inclusion of a home production

sector include Benhabib, Rogerson and Wright (1991), Baxter and Jermann (1999), Chang and Schorfheide
(2003), Greenwood and Hercowitz (1991), and Rupert, Rogerson and Wright (1995).

We restrict our home production function to have a constant elasticity of substitution
between time and market goods:
ct = K(ht , Qt ) ≡ (φhρt + Qρt )1/ρ

(17)

for some positive constant φ. This specification of a constant elasticity of substitution
between time spent on home production. ht , and market goods. Qt , is commonly used
in existing studies, and therefore adopting this form allows us to compare our results to
previous estimates in the literature. The elasticity of substitution between ht and Qt is
given by σ ≡ 1/(1 − ρ), and the marginal rate of transformation (MRT) is given by
∂Kt /∂ht

The Homescan data do not have information on time spent on home production and
shopping. Therefore, to estimate equation (19), we combine data on from the American Time
Use Survey (ATUS) with the Homescan price and quantity data based on the household’s
age, gender, and marital status. We split the sample into two non-overlapping periods, t=1
(year 2004-2007) and t=2 (years 2008-2010), to examine the change over the recession period.
The time use, quantity, and price data are averaged across households and time within each
household demographic group-time period. To compute the second term in equation (19)
we combine information from Homescan on Q, with our estimates of the returns to shopping
(Table 2, column III), and an estimate of the price elasticity ∂ ln p/∂ ln Q.18
We estimate equation (19) based on the following regression:
18

The price elasticity ∂ ln pjt /∂ ln Qjt is estimated from the following regression

ln pjm = α0 + αQ1 ln Qjm + αQ2 ln Qjt · 1(year > 2007) + α3 1(year > 2007) +

for household-group j (defined based on age, gender, and marital status) in period t. We
control for household-group fixed effects using λj , and time fixed effects using λt (which is
an indicator variable equal to one for t = 2). The estimate for the elasticity of substitution
between home production time and market goods is given by the coefficient −β1 = σ, and
the home production parameter φ is recovered from β0 = σ ln (φ). We test for changes in σ
over the business cycle based on β2 . A significant β2 would imply the existence of shocks to
home production during the recession.
Column I in Table 4 gives the between-household estimate, where the identification of
the coefficient comes from variation across household demographic groups. The elasticity
of substitution between market goods and time spent on home production is estimated to
be 1.2, with a standard error of 0.39. One concern with this estimate is that there may
be unobserved heterogeneity within each household demographic group, which may bias the
estimate of the elasticity. Therefore, we re-estimate equation (20), controlling for householdgroup fixed effects and allowing for variation across both household-group and time. This
gives a higher elasticity of 1.7, with a standard error of 0.48 (column II).
Our elasticity estimate of 1.7 is consistent with other micro and macro estimates of the
elasticity.19 The estimates are supportive of business cycle models with a strong degree
of complementarity between leisure and consumption, and home production models that
assume a high elasticity of substitution between the market sector and non-market sector.
In these models, home production amplifies the volatility of market work and consumption
relative to output, and lowers the correlation between productivity and market work (see for
example Benhabib, Rogerson and Wright (1991) and Greenwood and Hercowitz (1991)).
Our results also relate to recent studies that seek to explain the gap between the marginal
product of labor and the marginal rate of substitution between consumption and leisure
(known as the “labor wedge”), which widens during recessions.20 One hypothesis for the
19

For example, Rupert, Rogerson and Wright (1995) use aggregate U.S. data to estimate an estimate

that is slightly less than 2, while Chang and Schorfheide (2003) estimate a value of 2.3. Using micro data,
estimates of 1.8-2.0 are estimated in studies including Rupert, Rogerson and Wright (1995) and Aguiar and
Hurst (2007).
20
Studies that have discussed the labor wedge include Karabarbounis (2014), Hall (1997), Shimer (2009),
Cole and Ohanian (2004), Chari, Kehoe and McGrattan (2007), Chang and Kim (2007), and others.

cyclical wedge is that it reflects the unaccounted for substitution of time between the market
sector and the home sector in models without home production. This omission affects the
measured rate of substitution between consumption and leisure, and therefore the measured
labor wedge. Karabarbounis (2014) shows volatility of the labor wedge over the business
cycle can be explained by a home production model that assumes a value of 4 for the elasticity
of substitution between the market sector and the home sector. Our point estimate of 1.7
for the elasticity implies that the inclusion of a home production sector in these models may
explain almost half of the measured labor wedge.
Our estimates also allow us to examine a second question: whether home production
shocks are important drivers of the joint fluctuations between expenditure on market goods
and time spent on non-market work during 2008-2010. We find a statistically and economically insignificant coefficient (β2 ) on the interaction term from equation (20) in our
fixed-effects estimates (Table 4, column II). This result implies that home production shocks
were not the driving force behind the decline in market expenditure and increase in time
spent on non-market work between 2008 and 2010. This is consistent with Aguiar, Hurst
and Karabarbounis (2013), who derive a similar conclusion using data on state-level unemployment rates and time use.

5.3

Implications for Consumption Smoothing

Our estimated home production function also allows us to describe how households smooth
consumption over the business cycle. If households can substitute between expenditure
and time, then during recessions they can smooth part of income and wealth shocks by
reallocating time towards non-market work from time spent on leisure and market work. The
idea that households can smooth consumption by changing their behavior is not new. For
example, Blundell, Pistaferri and Saporta-Eksten (2012) show that households can partially
smooth consumption when a member of the family becomes unemployed by increasing the
hours worked by the secondary head of household. Here we consider a different margin of
time allocation within a household: the intra-temporal allocation between market hours and
non-market work. This is relevant for understanding the ability of households to smooth
unanticipated income and wealth shocks over the business cycle. We now show how the
changes in household behavior, we showed above, translate to variation in consumption
relative to market expenditure using our estimated home production function.

See text for additional details.

To see how consumption changed over 2008-2010, we take the derivative of the home production function (equation 17), and use a hat symbol to denote percentage change (relative
to previous two-year period 2006-2007). The percentage change in consumption is given by
Ĉ = θĥ + (1 − θ)Q̂
where
θ≡

φhρ
φhρ + Qρ

(21)

(22)

As in Aguiar and Hurst (2007), we can decompose the change in consumption during the
recession relative to expenditure into home production substitution and price savings from
shopping.21 Specifically, we can rewrite equation (21) as


Ĉ − X̂ = θ ĥ − X̂ − (1 − θ)p̂.

(23)

where percentage change in expenditure on market goods is denoted by X̂ = p̂ + Q̂.22 The
decomposition in equation (23) shows that households

 can smooth consumption by intratemporally reallocating time. The first term, ĥ − Q̂ , reflects the substitution between time
spent on home production and market goods. The second term, p̂, gives the price savings
derived from the change in shopping behavior during the recession.
We empirically compute the corresponding terms of equation (23) for the two distinct
periods of 2006-07 and 2008-10. Specifically, for each of the two time periods, we calculate
each term on the right hand side of (23) using the observed household averages for h (from the
American Time Use Survey), Q and X (from Homescan data), together with our estimates of
ρ and φ (from Section 5.2) and price savings (estimated using Homescan data and shown in
Section 4). The average price savings across households and shopping activities is computed
P ˆ
ˆ
as p̂ ≡
i fi · (∂ ln p/∂fi ), where fi denotes the increase in fraction of items with each
shopping activity i (coupon usage, purchases of sale, purchases of large items, purchases of
generic products, and buying from Big Box stores), and ∂ ln p/∂fi denotes the sensitivity of
21

This decomposition was also taken in Aguiar and Hurst (2007), where they focused on the variation

across households by age. Here, we shift the focus to the variation that occurred during the Great Recession
period to understand the ability of households to further smooth consumption beyond market expenditure
by varying their time use.
22
The expenditure is deflated by an aggregate inflation index for food so that X̂ excludes overall shifts
in food prices, but includes changes in prices that were due to shifts in households shopping behavior
(documented in Section 3) denoted by p̂.

price to the shopping activity, estimated in Section 4 (Table 2, column II). The parameter
θ is computed based on equation (22) using the average h and Q over period t = 1 (years
2006 and 2007), combined with our estimates of the home production parameter for ρ. This
gives a value of 0.35 for θ.
Table 5 shows the decomposition of the change in consumption relative to market expenditure, based on an estimated θ of 0.35. Over the recession period, expenditure fell by
8.8 percent (X̂), comprised of a 7.7 percent decline in quantity and a 1.1 percent decrease
in prices paid due to increased shopping intensity. In contrast, consumption is measured to
have declined by only 3.6 percent, which is about 60 percent less than the decline in market
expenditure. As a result, the gap between consumption and market expenditure widened by
5.2 percent (Ĉ − X̂). Approximately 80 percent of the gap was due to a substitution from
market goods towards time spent on home production (which rose by 3.8 percent), while
increased shopping intensity accounted for the remaining 20 percent.23
These results from our estimated home production function highlight the importance of
intra-temporal variations in time use for the purposes of smoothing consumption. During
recessions, households are faced with lower income and/or declines in wealth, which results
in lower expenditure. By reallocating time from lost market hours and leisure towards nonmarket work, they are able to partially smooth the decline in consumption (relative to market
expenditure). The results imply that intra-temporal reallocation of time reduced the decline
in consumption by almost 60 percent during the recession. These facts are consistent with
the observed joint decline in household expenditure and labor hours during recessions.
It is worth noting that our results pertain to food expenditures. Nonetheless, the ability
to shop for bargains and utilize other means of home production can also apply to broader
classes of goods. We expect that the ability to substitute between time and market expenditure can also play an important role in smoothing various non-food household consumption
when households are faced with unanticipated income and wealth shocks.

23

The share of the wedge (Ĉ − X̂) accounted for by the substitution between market goods and time

spent on home production is calculated by θ(ĥ − Q̂)/(Ĉ − X̂). The share accounted for by lower prices due
to increased shopping time is given by −(1 − θ)p̂/(Ĉ − X̂).

Robustness

In this section, we show that the main results of the previous section are qualitatively robust
to alternative sample period and functional form specifications.
We first consider the sensitivity of our results to the inclusion of the 2007 in the estimation. This was a year with significant food price increases, due to increased demand
in China and a drought in Australia, which were arguably unrelated to the business cycle.
Excluding 2007 does not qualitatively change the finding that households’ marginal value
of time fell during the recession. Specifically, we find that the cost of time declined by 28
percent, compared with a decline of 30 percent when 2007 is included (Column II of Table 6
and Column I of Table 7 in the appendix). The estimated elasticity of substitution between
market spending and time spent on home production is smaller in magnitude when 2007 is
excluded (0.965 compared with 1.7), but the difference is statistically insignificant. As in
our main results, we find that consumption declined by less than market expenditure over
2008-2010.
Next, in Column (III), we study whether the results change if we adjust for changes in
quality associated with shifts in shopping behavior.24 To do so, we consider an alternative
price index that takes into account changes in quality associated with the shifts from non24

For example, Bils (2009) and Bils and Klenow (2001) show that measured inflation may be biased if

product quality improvements are not taken into account.

35

generic to generic products. The index is constructed using the methodology described in
Section 4, but allows for two different average prices paid in each month: one for generic
products, and one for non-generic products. The estimated returns to shopping from this
alternative price index (column II of Table 7 in the appendix) are slightly lower than our
base case returns (column III, Table 2). However, we still find that returns to each shopping
activity declined during the recession period (column III of Table 6), implying a decline in
cost of time that is comparable to our base results. The estimated elasticity of substitution between market spending and time spent on home production is comparable to our
base result, and again imply that consumption declined by significantly less than market
expenditure over 2008-10.
Lastly, we also explored the sensitivity of our results to our assumption on the relationship between shopping activity and shopping time. In Section 5.1-5.2, we computed the
opportunity cost of time and estimated the home production parameters assuming that
∂fit /∂st = γi /fit
where fit denotes the fraction of shopping activity i as a share of total items bought by the
household in month t, st denotes the shopping time, and γi is a constant term. We consider
a range of alternative Box-Cox functional forms for f (s) with varying λ:
f (s) = (sλ − 1)/λ
In columns (IV-VI) of Table 6, we present the results for the cases λ = −1, λ = 0 (i.e.
f (s) = log(s)), and λ = 1. We find that the decline opportunity cost of time is qualitatively
robust across the various Box-Cox functional forms, with the change decreasing in the size of
λ. Similarly, we estimate a high elasticity of substitution between home production time and
market spending, which rises in λ, and a widening of the gap between implied consumption
and measured market spending during the Great Recession.
In summary, we find that our results are qualitatively robust to alternative sample periods
and functional form specifications: we find lower returns to shopping during the recession, a
sizable reduction in opportunity cost of time, and significant elasticity of substitution between
home production and market expenditure. These estimates imply that consumption declined
by less than market expenditure during the recession, in part because households lowered
the price they paid and engaged more in home production.

Conclusion

In this paper, we study how households substitute between time and money during the
recent recession, and compute the implications for consumption smoothing. We find that
households increased time spent on home production and shopping to reduce their market
expenditure, in a manner that is consistent with lower cost of time during the recession.
Our findings are consistent with theoretical home production models, which predict positive
co-movement between labor hours and expenditure.
Specifically, using Homescan data from Nielsen, we document that during the recent
recession, households increased their shopping intensity by purchasing more on sale, using
more coupons, buying larger sizes, switching to generic products and shopping more at Big
Box stores. These activities allowed households to lower the prices paid. However, we also
find that the returns to shopping declined during the recession. The lower returns imply a
sizable decline in households’ opportunity cost of time of 25-30 percent over 2008-2010. The
change in opportunity cost of time is consistent with a high elasticity of substitution between
market goods and time in home production, indicative of a high degree of complementarity
between leisure and consumption. We find households were able to smooth a sizable portion
of their consumption during recessions by varying their intra-temporal allocation of time.

Returns to Shopping

In this section, we consider three robustness checks to our returns to shopping analysis. First,
we consider the sample period. Second, we consider yet another definition of a product to
control for quality differences in purchases. Third, we consider the robustness of our analysis
to the definition of a market used to compute the comparison average price paid by all
households within the defined market. We find our results are qualitatively robust to all
three robustness checks.
Table 7 gives the estimated returns to shopping under two different robustness checks. In
Column (I), we estimate the returns excluding the year 2007. In Column (II), we estimate
the returns using an alternative price index (described in the main text) which controls for
the decline in quality due to a shift from non-generic to generic products.

43

Lastly, we also consider the robustness of our results to the definition of a market used
for computing the comparison average price paid in the market. Specifically, we compute
returns using a price index with the comparison average market price computed at a county
level instead of at a national level. Table 8 gives the estimated returns to shopping based on
an alternative price index:
P
p̃hm ≡ P

J∈D

J∈D

P

P j∈J,t∈m
j∈J,t∈m

h
phj,t qj,t
h
p̄j,m qj,t

for household h in month m. As described in the text earlier, J denotes a product,
D denotes the set of all products, and q are household-level quantities. In this alternative
index, we vary the definition of a market when defining the “average” comparison price in
the market p̄j,m . Specifically, we consider defining a market at a county level, rather than at
a national level.
The advantage of using a county definition of a market is that it allows us to control for
any possible county-specific supply shocks that are common across households within that
same county. Recall that the index controls for common supply-side shifts because these
factors are reflected in both the household-specific expenditure (the numerator) as well as
the comparison expenditure at average market prices (the denominator). Thus supply-side
shifts over time that are common across households within the same market are netted out
in the price index.
A disadvantage, however, of using a county-level definition of a market rather that a
nation-wide definition (considered in the main body of the text) is that we now need to
restrict the sample to counties that have sufficient number of panelists in the data to construct
a representative relative price index. Specifically, we restrict the sample to consist only of
counties that have at least 1,000 sample households. This reduces the sample by just over
40 percent to 2.3 million households.
Based on this sub-sample of counties, we find qualitatively similar results to our main
results. That is, we find that returns to shopping declined during the recession period for
all main shopping activities.

Index quantity weights

Note: Estimates in column (I) are based on a sample over the year 2004-2006 and 2008-2010 (i.e. it excludes
2007). The estimates are used to compute the results in Table 6, column (II). Estimates in column (II) are
based on an alternative price index which controls for the decline in quality due to a shift from non-generic
to generic products. The estimates are used to compute the results in Table 6, column (III). Standard errors
are given in parentheses.
