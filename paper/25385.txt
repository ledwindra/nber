Deposit Spreads and the Welfare Cost of Inflation
Pablo Kurlat
NBER Working Paper No. 25385
December 2018
JEL No. D43,E31,E41,G21
ABSTRACT
Since bank deposits and currency are substitutes and banks have monopoly power, higher
nominal interest rates lead to higher deposit spreads. This raises the cost of transaction services,
increases bank profits and attracts entry into the banking sector. Taking these effects into account,
a one percentage point increase in inflation has a welfare cost of 0.086% of GDP, 6.9 times
higher than traditional estimates.

The welfare cost of inflation is a longstanding concern of monetary economics, and the
recent debate about raising the inflation target lends it renewed relevance. One reason that
inflation is costly is that, other things being equal, higher inflation induces households to
reduce their money balances, forgoing some of the convenience of carrying money to conduct
transactions. A standard method for measuring the magnitude of this cost, proposed by
Bailey (1956) and pursued by Lucas (2000) and Ireland (2009) among others, is to measure
the area under the money demand curve. This is valid as long as money does not pay interest
and is costless to create. In this paper I propose and quantify a model that makes it possible
to extend this calculation to the case where bank-created money pays interest, there are
fixed costs to operating a bank, and the banking industry responds to changes in interest
rates.
The model is a variant of Drechsler et al. (2017). Households value the transaction
services of currency and several types of bank deposits, which are imperfect substitutes. The
opportunity cost of holding currency is the nominal interest rate; the opportunity cost of
holding a bank deposit is the deposit spread: the difference between the market interest rate
and the deposit interest rate. Banks have a fixed cost of operating but zero marginal cost
of issuing deposits, and have some degree of monopoly power to set deposit spreads. Under
constant elasticity of substitution, equilibrium spreads depend positively and linearly on the
nominal interest rate.
I assume that there is free entry into the banking industry. An increase in deposit spreads
raises bank profits, attracting entry until profits are diluted back to equal fixed costs. The
increase in the real amount of resources dedicated to fixed costs is part of the welfare cost
of higher inflation.
I estimate the parameters of the model using using a detailed database on deposit rates. I
first document, using time series variation, that the relationship between the interest rate and
deposit rates is indeed positive and close to linear. I then estimate the elasticity of demand
for deposits using geographic cross sectional variation in market shares of the largest banks.
Together with data on monetary aggregates, this makes it possible to construct an aggregate
measure of money and estimate its demand elasticity. Finally, I measure the elasticity of bank
profits with respect to bank concentration using cross sectional variation in the exposure of
local markets to bank mergers. Together, these estimates make it possible to quantify the
model.
I use the model to compute the welfare cost of a permanent increase in the inflation rate
by one percentage point (raising nominal interest rates from 2.5% to 3.5%) and find it to be

2

0.086% of GDP, which is 6.9 times higher than one finds using the approach in Lucas (2000)
and Ireland (2009). A factor of 1.9 results from constructing a monetary aggregate in the
way the model suggests, while the rest of the difference comes from taking into account the
resources dedicated to additional bank costs.

The Model

1.1

The Environment

The model is based on Drechsler et al. (2017). There is a representative household with
preferences
η−1

u (y, m) = y +
(1)
η−1
where y is consumption and m is transaction services from money holdings. The monetary
aggregate m is a nested CES aggregate of real currency c and bank deposits d, with elasticity
of substitution :

−1 −1
m = α  c  + (1 − α)  d 

(4)
j=1

When I quantify the model, I set J = 2; d1n represents checking accounts and d2n
represents savings accounts at bank n, both of which provide some amount of transaction
services.1 The nested structure embodies the assumption that bank customers purchase
banking services in bundles and competition across banks takes place at the level of the
bundle rather than at the level of the individual deposit type.2
1

I also re-do the calculations for J = 3, where d3n represents small time deposits.
Amel and Starr-McCluer (2002) and Amel et al. (2008) report that about 73% and 60% of checking and
savings deposit accounts respectively are held by households at their primary institution.

The government sets a nominal interest rate i and costlessly supplies as much currency c as
households demand. Deposits are supplied by banks; they have a fixed cost κ of operating but
can supply unlimited amounts of deposits at zero marginal cost. Since they have monopoly
power over their particular variety of deposit, they have to decide what interest rate they will
pay. Denote by ijn the interest rate paid by bank n on deposits of type j and let sjn ≡ i − ijn
be the deposit spread.

1.2

The Household’s Problem

The household chooses its money holdings by maximizing (1) subject to the budget constraint
y + ιm ≤ w
where w is the household’s wealth (which is irrelevant thanks to quasilinear preferences) and
ι is the minimized cost of holding one unit of the monetary aggregate m:
ι ≡ min

For currency, which pays zero nominal interest rate, the opportunity cost of holding it is the
interest rate i. The opportunity cost of holding deposits is the composite spread s, which is
an index of the deposit spreads charged by the N banks:

subject to (5)-(12). Using (7), (11) and (12), the objective function reduces to:

Since households choose deposit services in bundles, it is the price of the bundle sn that
matters for bank profits. The first order condition for optimally setting the spread sn is:
1=−

∂ log dn
∂ log sn

(13)

Since the marginal cost is zero, banks set spreads to maximize total spread income. They
do so by looking for the point on the demand curve where the elasticity of their individual
demand is minus one. Using (5)-(12), the elasticity of demand faced by bank n is:

Define ηd as the elasticity of the total demand for deposits with respect spreads s:

∂ log s

Using (8)-(11):
ηd =  − (1 − α) ( − η)

= 1, the first order condition

(18)

Equation (18), also found in Drechsler et al. (2017), has the following interpretation. If a
bank was a pure monopoly N = 1, it would face the total demand for deposits, so it would
set spreads at the point where the elasticity of total deposit demand is equal to minus one.
As the level of competition increases (either because there are more banks, or they are closer
substitutes to each other), demand for an individual bank’s deposits becomes more elastic
than total demand. Since individual demand elasticity must be equal to minus one, this
means that the equilibrium spread s must be at a less elastic point of the market demand
curve.
Rearranging (16), equilibrium spreads must satisfy

s=

and, using (5), this implies that

s=

(19)

Therefore spreads are a linear function of the interest rate i. The substitutability of currency

6

and deposits means that the opportunity cost of currency acts as an anchor for deposit
spreads. Note that this relies on banks actively choosing to exercise their monopoly power
by adjusting the price, and therefore the quantity, of deposits in response to the interest
rate. Di Tella and Kurlat (2017) study a similar model but where the supply of deposits is
fixed at a multiple of bank net worth. In that model, as the interest rate rises, households
substitute away from currency towards deposits, which leads to higher spreads and a fall in
the quantity of currency. However, this effect weakens as the interest rate rises because there
is less currency to substitute away from. Therefore, unless the currency-to-deposit ratio at
low interest rates is very high, spreads rapidly become flat at higher interest rates. Here,
instead, banks actively adjust spreads to keep si constant. Using (9) and (10), this implies a
constant currency-to-deposit ratio.
Replacing (19) in (5), the overall cost of transaction services is:3

Spreads for individual types of deposits sj are indeterminate because only the price of the bundle matters,
for both banks and households, but it’s easy to extend the model to pin them down. Suppose a fraction of
households only use checking accounts while the rest use both checking and savings accounts. The composite
deposit for the checking-only group is just d1n and its elasticity of substitution across banks is denoted σ1 .
The same reasoning that leads to (19) implies that the equilibrium spread faced by this group is

s1 =

 − η1 α
η1 − η 1 − α

1
 1−

i

with
η1 = 1 − (σ1 − 1) (N − 1)
Banks set the checking spread s1 at the level that would result if all households only had checking accounts
and set the spread on savings accounts s2 so that the composite spread s satisfies (19). Since the spreads
on individual types of deposits do not play a role in the welfare calculations below, I conduct the analysis
at the level of the composite spread s.

Other things being equal, if η < 1 then bank profits are increasing in the nominal interest
rate. Higher interest rates are associated with higher spreads, but also lower deposit holdings.
If the elasticity of money demand is less than 1, then the first effect dominates and profits
are increasing.
I assume that there’s free entry into the banking sector. An entering bank automatically
obtains a market share N1 (the fixed cost includes whatever advertising or setup costs are
involved in attaining this market share). Ignoring integer constraints, the free entry condition
is
π
=κ
(23)
N
For the welfare calculation, it will be necessary to compute the elasticity of entry with
respect to the interest rate. Using the implicit function theorem, the free entry condition
(23) implies that the elasticity of the number of banks with respect to the interest rate is:
∂ log π

∂ log N
∂ log i
=
log π
∂ log i
1 − ∂∂ log
N
Equation (22) implies that
∂ log π
= (1 − η)
∂ log i
and equation (21) and definition (15) imply that
∂ log π
∂ log s
= (1 − ηd )
∂ log N
∂ log N
Therefore:

∂ log N
1−η
=
log s
∂ log i
1 − (1 − ηd ) ∂∂log
N

(24)

Entry will respond strongly to interest rates if (i) η is low, because an inelastic money
log s
demand means that profits respond strongly to interest rates, (ii) the absolute value of ∂∂log
N
is low, because this means that entry does not rapidly compete away total profits by lowering
spreads, or (iii) the elasticity of demand for deposits is high, because this means that if entry
does lower spreads, banks partly make up for it with higher volume. Taken literally, the
log s
model has implications for the value of ∂∂log
but they are not robust to different ways of
N
microfounding the source of banks’ monopoly power. For instance, Drechsler et al. (2017)
show that the model is isomorphic to one where, instead of just product differentiation, the
source of market power is that a fraction of customers are stuck with one bank. For this
8

reason, I will leave

1.6

∂ log s
∂ log N

as an additional parameter to be estimated.

Welfare

The main exercise is to calculate the impact on welfare of an increase in the rate of inflation,
which I assume translates one for one into an increase in the nominal interest rate. Welfare
is given by:
η−1
1
η
u = w − Nκ +
βηm η
(25)
η−1
I assume that bank profits and seignorage revenue are rebated back to the household. Therefore the representative household consumes its wealth minus what is spent on the fixed costs
of banks, and also enjoys the transaction services provided by money. Importantly, I assume
that banks’ fixed costs involve spending real resources. If instead they represented some sort
of fee that is also rebated back to the household, then they should not be subtracted from
(25).

. The
alternative proposed by Drechsler et al. (2017) where the source of market power is captive consumers as
opposed to product differentiation also has no direct gains from variety. If preferences did have a taste for
variety, then this would be an additional channel (in addition to reduced market power), whereby entry
lowers the effective cost of transaction services.

that relates the welfare cost of inflation to the elasticity of money demand. For the general
case, the formula takes into account three additional forces.
First, as set out by equation (20), the slope of the cost of transaction services with respect

to the interest rate need not equal one. Hence the factor α ηd −η
, which translates
increases in interest rates into increases in the cost of transaction services.
Second, other things being equal, higher rates make banks more profitable, which induces
entry, and real resources are dedicated to the fixed costs of the entering banks. This is
captured by the terms in equation (28). The hypothesis that higher inflation leads to a
larger banking sector has been studied before. English (1999) documents a positive crosscountry correlation between the share of financial sector value added in GDP and the rate
of inflation. Yoshino (1993) shows country-by-country time-series evidence in the same
direction. Bresciani Turroni (1937), Wicker (1986), Marom (1998), Kleiman (1989) and
Aiyagari et al. (1998) also document this correlation, focusing on episodes of very high
inflation. Dotsey and Ireland (1996) study a quantitative model where this effect is present.5
Third, entry affects spreads by increasing competition, partly offsetting the increase in
the opportunity cost of money. This is reflected in the second term inside the brackets in

The traditional calculation based on equation (30) concludes that a relatively inelastic

measures the size of the banking sector by its value added or by total operating costs but not if one measures
it by the volume of deposits.

money demand implies a low welfare cost of inflation, because it means that the area under
the demand curve is small. Equation (29) implies an effect in the opposite direction. An
inelastic money demand means that bank profits respond strongly to higher interest rates,
inducing entry and the associated fixed costs.

Measurement

2.1

Data

The first source of data is the monetary aggregates compiled by the Federal Reserve, which
I use to construct monthly time series of c and dj . c is the stock of currency in circulation.
d1 is M1 adjusted for retail sweeps minus currency.6 d2 is the savings deposits component
of M2 minus the difference between M1 adjusted and unadjusted for retail sweeps. All the
monetary aggregates are scaled by dividing by annualized nominal GDP (from NIPA) for
the corresponding quarter. When I re-do the calculations for J = 3, I let d3 be the small
time deposit component of M2. In addition, for purposes of comparison, I look at Monetary
Services Index (MSI) aggregate computed by the Federal Reserve of St. Louis and the
Divisia M2, M3 and M4 indices published by the Center for Financial Stability and their
corresponding user costs.
The second source of data is deposit data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
The FDIC reports a total dollar amount of deposits for each bank branch at an annual
frequency. I aggregate this data up to the county level to construct an annual panel of countylevel deposits. Unfortunately, the FDIC just reports total deposits, without distinguishing
between different types of deposits.
The next source of data is on deposit interest rates. The firm RateWatch conducts
a weekly survey of interest rates paid on various types of deposits of about 16,000 bank
branches, representing approximately 25% of total deposits in the US. I use this data to
construct both aggregate time series and a county-level panel on deposit spreads spanning
from December 1997 to December 2017. I aggregate to either the county or the national
level by taking total-deposit-weighted averages across bank branches (where the weights are
constructed using the FDIC data). I do this separately for three types of deposits. s1 is
constructed using rates on “Interest Checking Accounts with no lower limit” and s2 using
6

Retail sweeps are like checking accounts from the point of view of the bank customer but are classified
as savings accounts and not included in M1; the adjusted series adds them back in. See Anderson and Jones
(2011) for details.

rates on “Money Market Accounts with $25,000 lower limit”. When I set J = 3, I construct
s3 using rates on “12-month Certificates of Deposit with $10,000 lower limit”. These are the
most common types of checking, savings and time deposit accounts, offered by 95.9%, 97.2%
and 99.5% of all bank branches respectively.
As discussed by Anderson and Jones (2011), the empirical counterpart of the model
concept of a market interest rate is not entirely clear. Conceptually, this corresponds to the
interest rate on a safe asset that does not provide any transaction services. In practice, most
safe assets are at least somewhat useful for conducting some types of transactions. As a
baseline, I construct a time series of i as the maximum of: the effective federal funds rate,
the 3-month LIBOR rate, the yield on 3-month AA+ commercial paper, 3-month Broad GC
repo rates, 3-month banker’s acceptance rates and the median rate (across all bank branches)
on 3-month time deposits of 100K+ dollars. I then define spreads as the difference between
the deposit rate and this benchmark rate.
Finally, in the estimation of the elasticity of spreads with respect to entry, I make use
of the Commercial Bank Database of the Federal Reserve, which contains data on bank
mergers.

using cross-sectional data. I set the remaining four parameter values to jointly match the
elasticity of money demand, the elasticity of deposit demand, the slope of deposit spreads
with respect to interest rates and the currency-to-deposit ratio. Matching these moments
is a fixed point problem, which can be solved in a number of ways. I do so by iterating
on the following steps, starting from conjectured values for , η, α, ηd and the elasticity of
substitution across deposit types d .
The first step is to compute weights {αj }Jj=1 on the j deposit types and the slope of the
composite spread s with respect to i, which I denote by γ. I use the J time series of spreads
on different deposit types to estimate linear regressions of sjt on it . Denote the estimated
slopes by γj . Using (7), γ aggregates the individual slopes according to:

Using (9), (10), (12) and symmetry across banks, the currency-to-j-deposit ratio is given by:
c

(γj )d γ −d
dj
αj 1 − α

(32)

Using the conjectured values of , α and d , and empirical moments γj and dcj , I obtain values
for {αj }Jj=1 and γ by solving equations (31) and (32).
The second step is to compute the currency-to-composite-deposit ratio. Equation (4)
implies that it can be constructed from the individual currency-to-j-deposit ratios according
to:

The third step is to update the conjectured values of α and . Using equations (8), (9)
and (19), the model predicts that the currency-to-composite deposit ratio should be equal
to:

(35)
(36)

Equation (35) has the following interpretation. By (16), the elasticity of deposit demand is
a weighted average of the elasticity of money demand η and the elasticity of substitution
between currency and deposits . Therefore if I measure the elasticities of money and deposit
demand I can reconstruct what elasticity of substitution rationalizes them. If the demand
for deposits is highly elastic while the money demand is not, I will infer that what makes
deposit demand elastic is substitution with currency, and find a high value of . Equation
(36) implies, unsurprisingly, that I will infer a high weight of currency in the money aggregate

13

if the observed currency-to-deposit ratio is high.
The fourth step is to update the conjectured value of η. Using the updated values of
α and , I can construct a time series of mt using (2) and the subcomponents of monetary
aggregates, and use it to estimate a money demand equation. Equation (8) implies that if I
regress log mt on log it , the regression coefficient should be equal to −η .
The fifth and final step is to update the conjectured value of ηd . I use equation (7) and
the estimated αj to construct data on composite-deposit spreads. Then I use cross-sectional
variation in spreads to estimate the elasticity of deposit demand with respect to spreads. By
definition, this provides an estimate of ηd .
By iterating on these steps until convergence, I obtain values of , α, η and ηd for any
conjectured value of d . The elasticity of inter-deposit substitution d is harder to measure
because I don’t have the detailed cross-sectional quantity data by type of deposit that would
allow estimation by the same procedure used to estimate currency-deposit substitution. I
therefore show results for different values of d , taking d = 1 as a baseline.

Empirical Results

Figure 1 shows scatterplots of spreads on checking accounts and savings accounts against
nominal interest rates. Both figures show a strong positive association between spreads and
interest rates.7
Part of this association could be simply due to a form of stickiness. Although the theoretically relevant price for the deposit is the spread, prices for deposits are typically quoted
in terms of the interest rate rather than the spread. A large empirical literature (Hannan
and Berger 1991, Neumark and Sharpe 1992, Driscoll and Judson 2013, Craig and Dinger
2014, Yankov 2014) has documented that deposit rates take some time to react to changes in
interest rates, which implies that spreads over-react in the short run. The model has nothing
to say about these short-run dynamics, so I attempt to estimate the relationship between
spreads and interest rates that remains after spreads have had time to adjust.8 Suppose that
stickiness takes the form:
ijt = λij,t−1 + (1 − λ) (1 − γj ) it
(37)
7

This is true in other countries as well. See Appendix A for some international evidence.
In terms of mapping to the model, I assume that the data corresponds to equilibria of the model with
fixed parameter values and different interest rates. In particular, I assume that interest rate changes are
perceived as temporary and bank entry only responds to permanent changes, so all the data comes from a
model with fixed N .

Figure 1: Spreads and interest rates
Expression (37) says that banks set rates on j-type deposits as a weighted average of their
target rate (1 − γj ) it and the rate they were offering the previous period. λ = 1 would
represent completely sticky rates and λ = 0 immediate adjustment. Using sjt = it − ijt , this
implies:
sjt = (1 − (1 − λ) (1 − γj )) it − λ (it−1 − sj,t−1 )
In order to estimate γj , I estimate, for each j:
sjt = a0j + a1j it + a2j (it−1 − sj,t−1 ) + υjt
and then set
γj = 1 −

(38)

1 − a1j
1 + a2j

The model implies that a0 should be equal to zero, so I also estimate versions that impose
a0 = 0. The results are shown on Table 1. Columns 1 and 4 (for checking and savings
respectively) correspond to the specification that does not impose a0 = 0. The constant
terms are very small, and not statistically different from zero, consistent with spreads being
a linear function of i. Columns 2 and 5 impose a0 = 0, which makes very little difference;
15

columns 3 and 6 also impose a2 = 0, equivalent to assuming no stickiness. Even though
deposit rates are estimated to be quite sticky, taking stickiness into account does not change
the estimated slopes very much. The slopes of spreads with respect to interest rates are
estimated to be γ1 = 0.85 for checking and γ2 =0.57 for savings. Using formula (31), the
benchmark d = 1 and the estimated values of αj , which are α1 = 0.73 and α2 = 0.27, this
implies that the slope of composite deposits is γ = 0.76.9

Figure 2 shows scatterplots of the ratio of currency to deposit holdings against the nominal interest rate, for checking deposits, savings deposits and composite deposits d (constructed using equation (4)). The model implies that these ratios should be constant.
Even though they are not exactly constant, neither currency-to-checking nor currency-tosavings ratios show a strong correlation with interest rates, and neither does the currencyto-composite deposits ratio, justifying the approximation that dc is constant. The average
value of dc is 0.22.

Table 2: Money demand elasticity
In order to estimate the elasticity of demand for deposits, I exploit cross-sectional variation in deposit spreads. I assume that households obtain banking services exclusively in
their own county, so that each county represents a separate experiment of the model.10 Let
10

Amel et al. (2008) report that over 94% of households have their main checking account at a branch

17

Figure 3: Money demand
skt be the composite deposit spread in county k in period t, constructed by aggregating the
spreads on different types of deposits using (7). I estimate:
log dkt = a0 − ηd log skt + υkt

(40)

There are several difficulties in estimating ηd . The first is that for many county-year
observations, especially when interest rates are low, measured spreads are negative, which
is incompatible with the log-log specification (40).11 I attempt to sidestep this difficulty by
only estimating (40) on those time periods where less than 100 (out of 2668) counties have
negative spreads.12 Within these time periods, I replace any observation with a negative
spread with a spread equal to one basis point (truncating at 10 basis points gives almost
identical results).
A second problem with estimating equation (40) by OLS is that skt is likely endogenous.
within 30 miles of their home, and 75% of them within 5 miles.
11
The model has no way to account for negative spreads, since households in the model would demand
infinite deposits. Negative spreads could reflect banks’ efforts to retain customers as part of a dynamic
strategy that is not well captured by the model, or possibly fees that banks charge in addition to spreads.
12
This means dropping the years 2002-2004 and 2009-2015, about half the sample.

18

For instance, it’s possible that banks might respond to a local increase in the demand for
deposits by raising spreads, which would bias the estimate of ηd towards zero. In other words,
I need to make identifying assumptions to make sure that I am estimating the elasticity of
demand rather than supply. I do this by using an instrumental variables strategy in the
spirit of Bartik (1991).13 For each county, I compute the market shares of the 10 nationallylargest banks at the beginning of my sample. I then use these market shares, interacted
with a full set of time dummies, to instrument for log skt . The assumption is that deposit
spreads are partly decided at the national level for idiosyncratic bank-level reasons and
therefore uncorrelated with local demand shocks. Since different local markets have different
exposure to different banks’ pricing, this creates cross-sectional variation in spreads that
is uncorrelated with υkt .14 I include county fixed effects in the regression, so I am only
exploiting within-county variation in spreads driven by changes over time in national banks’
deposit pricing policies.
A third problem with this estimation is that the deposit quantity data, which is taken
from the FDIC, is a simple sum rather than an aggregate constructed according to (4).
Furthermore, it includes all deposit types, including time deposits, which are not part of
composite deposits when I set J = 2. This introduces measurement error in dkt . If the
measurement error is correlated with the instrument, this biases the estimate of ηd . For
instance, suppose national banks that operate in county k raise savings-deposit spreads for
idiosyncratic reasons and households respond by respond by reducing savings deposits but
increasing time deposits. Measured deposits will not fall even though the model-relevant
quantity of deposits does. This will bias the measured ηd towards zero. The available
quantity data, which does not distinguish by deposit type, does not make it possible to
overcome this possible bias.
The results are shown on Table 3. The estimated elasticity is ηd = 0.20.
Using equations (35) and (36), together with η = 0.11, ηd = 0.20, γ = 0.76 and dc = 0.22,
I obtain parameter values  = 0.53 and α = 0.20.
log s
Finally, I need to estimate ∂∂log
. To do this, I first compute Herfindahl concentration
N
indices Hkt for each county and time period. I then estimate the following specification,
13

See Goldsmith-Pinkham et al. (2018) for a recent discussion of this approach
One worry may be that individual banks may change spreads and other characteristics of the deposit
service (such as the perceived solvency of the bank) at the same time. The measured elasticity would be
the response to the sum of these changes. Egan et al. (2017) estimate a model where this type of effect is
present.

where sjkt is the spread on deposit type j in county k in period t and ajk is a vector of
county fixed effects. (41) imposes the linearity of spreads in i implied by the model but lets
the slope vary by county and over time within a county if that county’s Herfindahl index

The first step just uses that with symmetric banks H = N1 . The second step uses formula
(7) for aggregating spreads on different deposit types. The final step uses that sj = γj i and
ds
replaces d logjH with its empirical estimate bj .
The problem with estimating equation (41) by OLS is that Hkt is likely endogenous.
For instance, a rise in spreads for idiosyncratic county-level reasons (for instance, due to an
increase in county-level deposit demand) could attract bank entry, lowering Hkt . This would
bias the estimate of bj downwards.
To overcome this, I exploit mergers between large banks as a predictor of concentration.
15

Estimating (41) instead of a specification with log sjkt on the left hand side avoids having to transform
the data to deal with negative measured spreads.

20

Garmaise and Moskowitz (2006) use a related approach to measure the effect of bank mergers
on local social and economic indicators. Following their criteria, I compile a list of all the
bank mergers and acquisitions in which both banks had at least $1 billion in assets in the year
prior to the merger. There are a total of 654 valid mergers between 1998 and 2017, the time
range for which I have RateWatch data. For each county, I compute market shares at the
beginning of the sample. I then compute a fictitious time series H̃kt of the Herfindahl index
for each county by assuming that market shares stay constant except when there are mergers;
when two banks that have branches in the same county merge, I add their market shares. I
then use log H̃kt as an instrument for log Hkt in estimating (41). Since ajk are county fixed
effects, I am only exploiting the within-county variation that comes from changes in local
concentration that are the result of mergers between large banks. The results are shown
on Table 4. In the IV specification, both checking and savings spreads are estimated to
respond to bank concentration, with similar magnitudes. Applying formula (42) results in a

Table 4: Spreads and concentration
There have been previous attempts to measure the effect of concentration on deposit
spreads. Also using RateWatch and FDIC data, Drechsler et al. (2017) find significant
effects of concentration when estimating a first-differences specification, which regresses the
change in spreads on the change in interest rates, interacted with a measure of concentration.
For measuring the profit-eroding effect of entry, what matters is the effect on levels rather
than first-differences (although if spreads are exactly linear functions of interest rates, the
two formulations should give the same answer). In Italian data, Focarelli and Panetta (2003)
find that mergers tend to raise spreads in the short run but lower them in the long run, but
their focus is on comparing merged with unmerged banks rather that measuring the effect
of concentration on market-wide spreads. Prager and Hannan (1998) find that mergers are
associated with an increase in market-wide spreads. In an older dataset, Berger and Hannan
(1989) find a positive association between concentration and savings deposit spreads.

At a nominal interest rate of 2.5%, the estimates from Table 2 indicate that m is equal to

or 8.6 basis points of GDP.
Table 5 shows how sensitive this magnitude is to various assumptions. As discussed
in Section 2.2, I don’t have the data that would enable me to estimate the elasticity of
substitution across deposit types. The baseline figures are computed under the assumption
that d = 1 but, as shown in columns 2-4, this makes a relatively minor difference.
As discussed in Section 2.3, there are reasons to believe that the estimation of the elasticity of demand for deposits may be biased towards zero. Columns 5 and 6 show the results
of re-doing the calculations assuming a demand for deposits that is more elastic than the
baseline ηd = 0.20. Higher values of ηd imply a higher welfare cost of inflation. The reason
can be seen from equation (24). Higher ηd implies that entry responds more strongly to
changes in the interest rate. A more elastic demand for deposits means that when entry
lowers spreads, profits fall less because the quantity of deposits increases more. As a result,
more entry is needed to restore the free entry condition, so more resources are dedicated to
bank fixed costs.
Column 7 shows the effect of re-doing the whole calculation assuming J = 3, with small
time deposits as a third component of composite deposits. Spreads on time deposits are
much lower than those on savings accounts but despite being cheaper for households, the
quantity held is lower. The model therefore infers that they have little weight in composite
deposits (α3 = 0.1) and including them doesn’t change the number very much.

Perhaps the most common approach is the one by Lucas (2000) and Ireland (2009). They
assume that the relevant measure of money is M1 (adjusted for retail sweeps), and that
money does not pay interest. In this case, using the values for M1 from Table 2, the welfare
cost of a one percentage point increase in inflation is:16

Both Lucas (2000) and Ireland (2009) mention that the focus on M1 as the relevant
monetary aggregate is somewhat arbitrary. An alternative, advocated by Cysne (2003), is
to base the calculation on a broader monetary aggregate. If households obtain transaction
services from a monetary aggregate M with user cost ιM , then the welfare cost of inflation
can be computed as follows.

is the interest elasticity of demand for the aggregate M . The first step

is just rearranging and the second step uses the household’s first order condition for money

= ιM .
One class of broad monetary aggregates are Divisia indices such as the MSI and the CFS
Divisia M2-M4 indices. These use aggregation theory to weight the amount of transaction
services provided by different forms of quasi-money assets (see Anderson and Jones (2011)
and Barnett et al. (2013) for details). I show figures based on the MSI but results using the
CFS indices are similar. I first estimate an affine relationship between the MSI user cost and
the benchmark interest rate (by definition, the user cost is the opportunity cost of holding
one unit of the index). I use specification (38) to allow for possible stickiness in the interest
rates paid by the underlying assets that make up the MSI. The results are shown on Table
6. They imply that the best affine approximation to the relationship between the MSI user

Lucas (2000) estimates a log-log specification like (39) while Ireland (2009) estimates a semi-log specification log mt = a0 + a1 it + υt . This makes a difference for computing the welfare impact of a large change
in inflation (both authors focus on the welfare gain of bringing the interest rate all the way down to zero).
For a local change of the type considered here, the choice of specification doesn’t make much difference as
long as it’s a good local approximation at the point of interest. The number I find applying this approach
is not the same as the actual numbers from Lucas (2000) because he estimates the money-demand elasticity
on a different sample and finds a higher number.

A similar exercise can be conducted using the model-implied index m instead of a Divisia
index. This is simply the welfare cost of inflation from the model if the entry margin is
shut down. Conceptually, the model-implied index m and the MSI are similar, except that
the MSI is constructed on the basis of finer categories and solely on the basis of prices and
quantities, without relying on estimates of the elasticity of substitution. Nevertheless, using
both aggregates yields similar numbers.
I also compute the welfare cost from the model under the assumption that fixed costs do
not represent real resource costs but are fees rebated back to the household (but taking into
account the spread-reducing effects of entry). This produces an even lower figure than just
shutting down the entry margin.

Conclusion

There is very strong evidence that deposit spreads, and thus the profitability of banks, are
higher when interest rates are higher. If the banking industry is characterized by free entry
and high fixed costs, this implies that a permanently higher inflation rate will induce real
resources to be dedicated to chasing these profits. This is a large component of the welfare
cost of inflation.

A

International Evidence

The correlation between market interest rates and deposit spreads is not exclusive to the
US. Figure 4 shows scatterplots of deposit spreads against market interest rates in selected
countries. The slope varies by country, possibly due to differences in the degree of banking
competition, but in all cases the relationship is strongly positive and not too far from linear.17

these are quoted as absolute amounts, either per period or per event, so it’s hard to convert
them into percentages to make them comparable with spreads.
They do, however, co-move strongly. For each category of fee, I compute an average
value across all reporting branches for each year. This results in 40 yearly time series. I
standardize each of these time series and then compute principal components. The first
principal component explains 49.4% of the (standardized) variation.
Figure 5 shows a scatterplot of the first principal component of fees against the nominal
