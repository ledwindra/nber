Inefficient Provision of Liquidity
Oliver D. Hart and Luigi Zingales
NBER Working Paper No. 17299
August 2011
JEL No. E41,E51,G21
ABSTRACT
We study an economy where the lack of a simultaneous double coincidence of wants creates the need
for a relatively safe asset (money). We show that, even in the absence of asymmetric information or
an agency problem, the private provision of liquidity is inefficient. The reason is that liquidity affects
prices and the welfare of others, and creators do not internalize this. This distortion is present even
if we introduce lending and government money. To eliminate the inefficiency the government must
restrict the creation of liquidity by the private sector.

1. Introduction

Historically, one of the primary functions of the banking sector has been to create means of
payment (“money like” liabilities) either in the form of bank notes (private money) or credit. Yet
most models of banking focus on other aspects, such as risk sharing or monitoring. Less attention
has been paid to the role of banks in creating liquidity for transactions purposes and how this
interacts with the government’s role in this area. Does a competitive banking sector generate the
socially optimal amount of the means of payment? How does the liquidity created by the banking
sector affect the equilibrium level of goods and asset prices? Does the degree of competition in
the banking sector affect the amount of liquidity created and hence the level of prices?
In this paper we try to answer these questions. We show that, even in the absence of
asymmetric information or an agency problem, the amount of liquidity generated by the banking
sector is inefficient. A competitive banking sector generates an excessive quantity of means of
payment, while a monopolistic one a scarcity. The distortion arises from two externalities the
creation of money has in general equilibrium: more money increases the equilibrium prices of
the goods that those with the money buy; but it also increases the wealth of the agents supplying
these goods and so the prices of the goods they will buy. These externalities are pecuniary in
nature but unlike standard pecuniary externalities they have welfare consequences.
A competitive bank, which ignores the externality imposed on other buyers, will generate too
much liquidity. A monopolistic bank that serves the buyers, and ignores the welfare of the
sellers, generates too little liquidity. There is one intermediate level of competition that generates
the efficient amount of liquidity but it would be fortuitous for the economy to end up there.
We start by assuming that future income (be it labor income or investment income) is not
pledgeable (or contractible). Eventually, however, we relax this assumption, requiring only that
human capital is inalienable and a worker can quit at any time.
In such a world we are able to show that transactional needs create a demand for relatively
safe assets (liquidity). The intuition is that transactional needs generate a form of risk aversion
even in risk neutral people. When an agent has the opportunity/desire to buy, having twice as
much pledgeable wealth in some states does not compensate her for the risk of having half as
much in other states, because in the latter states she is wealth constrained. As a result, agents are
willing to hold relatively safe assets even if they have a lower yield.

2

We analyze these issues in a simple economy consisting of two groups of agents: doctors and
builders. Doctors buy building services from builders and then builders buy doctors’ services
from doctors, or the other way round. Agents are also endowed with wheat. There is a lack of a
simultaneous double coincidence of wants: each builder requires a doctor at a different date and
typically one with different skills from the doctor he is building for, and vice versa for builders.
Since future income is not pledgeable this generates a need for liquidity. Wheat is costly to carry
and can easily rot, so banks arise in our model as depositary institutions, which store wheat and
issue notes. An alternative to depositing wheat in a bank is to invest it in higher return activities
that take place outside the banking sector. Initially, we suppose that the returns from these
activities are not pledgeable.
For much of the paper we simply assume that low return activities inside the banking
sector are pledgeable and that high return activities outside are not. Later we delve more deeply
into what determines whether an asset’s return can be collateralized for the purposes of liquidity.
We start by studying the effect of the supply of notes on equilibrium prices and on social
welfare when banks are purely passive institutions that “notify” all deposits, i.e., an agent who
deposits a unit of wheat receives a note of equal value. In notifying the deposits of a doctor who
buys building services before he sells doctors services, a bank imposes a negative externality on
doctors in the same position at other banks: raising the amount of money increases the price of
building services, which is bad for them since they consume these services. Because of this
externality too much wheat endowment is stored to create liquidity instead of being invested in
socially productive activities.
The distortion in liquidity that we identify is present even when banks can control the
notification process, as long as they act in a competitive way. A monopolistic bank, in contrast,
ends up under-producing money; this is the standard result that a profit maximizing monopolist
restricts production. We show that the distortion is robust to the introduction of lending and
government money. We introduce government money by supposing that the government can
impose sales taxes and that agents can pay these sales taxes with government notes.
While the introduction of government money potentially crowds out the need for private money,
government money is costly to the extent that sales taxes impose deadweight losses.
As noted, in most of the paper we take the distinction between collateralizable and noncollateralizable assets as exogenous. In Section 6 we go into this more deeply. Suppose that
3

activities that earn a higher expected return are also riskier. Assume that the returns from these
activities are positively correlated and that uncertainty about them is resolved before trading
takes place. Then a high return realization provides large amounts of liquidity for the economy,
while a low return realization provides low amounts of liquidity. However, since there are
diminishing returns to liquidity—the value of liquidity falls to zero when the gains from trade
have been exhausted—this induces the equivalent of risk aversion in agents: the yield on the high
return asset is discounted in the good state, and as a result the safe asset is favored for liquidity
purposes. Given this interpretation of the model our main result is that an unregulated market
economy allocates an excessive amount of resources to assets whose returns are stable.
Our paper is related to two literatures: that on banking and that on money. Much of the
banking literature is concerned with the role played by banks and the need for bank regulation
(see, for example, Dewatripont and Tirole (1994)). One branch of the banking literature, starting
with Diamond (1984) and continuing with Holmstrom and Tirole (1997), focuses on the asset
side of banks: their role in monitoring loans. Another branch of the literature, starting with
Diamond and Dybvig (1983), focuses on the liability side of banks: the ability of banks to
provide risk sharing in the face of liquidity needs (Diamond and Dybvig (1983), Allen and Gale
(1998) and (2007), and Bhattacharya and Gale (1987)), or to reduce future adverse selection
(Gorton and Pennacchi (1990)). There are also some papers, such as Diamond and Rajan (2001),
which try to integrate the two sides, showing how demand deposits are critical in making
credible the ability of lenders to extract a repayment for their loans.
Holmstrom and Tirole (1998) and (2011) focus on moral hazard on the side of suppliers
of liquidity, rather than on the side of users. They show that, in the presence of aggregate
uncertainty, the state power to tax future income creates liquidity for the corporate sector,
improving its ability to invest.
In all these papers the source of friction is either some informational asymmetry or some
agency problem (or both). While these problems are important, they are not the only ones
relevant for banks. One reason banks are unique is that they issue liabilities that are used as a
means of payment. Our goal is to analyze the implications of this role. For this reason, we
abstract from all the other frictions and focus on the externalities in the creation of money. A
general theory of banking would bring all these frictions together.

4

A recent strand of the banking literature, which deals with the transactional role of
deposits, introduces behavioral features. This strand derives the uniqueness of banks from the
misperception by depositors that their claims are safe (Gennaioli et al. (2010), Rotemberg
(2010)) or from the banks’ ability to arbitrage irrationally exuberant markets and rationally
priced deposits (Shleifer and Vishny (2010)). We do not introduce behavioral aspects here.
Our result that the creation of inside money is excessive is similar to Stein (2011). In his
model, however, it is assumed that agents have a discontinuous demand for a riskless claim
(money). Similarly, his inefficiency arises from an assumed friction in the financial markets (that
patient investors cannot raise additional money), while ours arises endogenously. Stein’s model,
however, is richer in terms of implications for monetary policy. In this respect, the two models
can be seen as complementary. Our results are also related to those in chapter 7 of Holmstrom
and Tirole (2011). They show that investors tend to hold an excessive amount of liquidity to take
advantage of potential firesales. Our model shows that this excess of liquidity is not specific to
the storage role of money; it applies also to its transactional role.
Our paper is also related to the huge literature on money. Much of this literature is
concerned with the role money plays in general equilibrium (e.g., Hahn (1965)). To create such
a role, one needs to dispense with the traditional Walrasian auctioneer and explicitly introduce an
exchange process. Ostroy and Starr (1990) provide an excellent survey of attempts in this
direction. As far as we can tell, none of these attempts analyze the externality we identify in our
paper. The role money plays in our model (i.e., to address the lack of double coincidence of
wants) is similar to that in Kyotaki and Wright (1989). Their focus, however, is on what goods
can become money and how. Our focus is to what extent private banks can provide the efficient
quantity of medium of exchange. Another large part of the literature on money analyzes the role
of inside money on monetary policy, as in Brunnermaier and Sannikov (2010), Diamond and
Rajan (2006), and Kashyap and Stein (2004). Our model is silent on this.
Our approach resembles that of Kiyotaki and Moore (1997) and (2002). Like us, they
rely on some limited pledgeability of future income. Their main focus, however, is on the
multiplier/contagion effect that the failure of one intermediary can have on the overall system.
Our paper, instead, is concerned with externalities in the creation of liquidity.
Finally, our approach is close to that of Mattesini et al (2009). They study banking using
the tools of mechanism design. They consider an economy with two groups of consumers who
5

want to trade with each other. As in our model, there is a timing problem: the first group has to
buy from the second group before they have sold their own output. Mattesini et al (2009) analyze
how claims on deposits with third parties are a better means of exchange than claims on
individual wealth. They study the social optimum but not the market equilibrium. In contrast, we
take the superiority of third party deposits as given, and study the divergence between the market
equilibrium and the social optimum.
The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2 we lay out the framework and
describe the Walrasian equilibrium. In Section 3 we analyze the effect of the introduction of
banks as storage facilities. In Section 4 we introduce the possibility of bank lending. In Section 5
we study the interaction between private money and government money. In Section 6 we
consider some extensions, while in section 7 we discuss the implications this paper has for the
nature of money. Conclusions follow.

2. The Framework

We consider an economy that lasts three periods:

1 ----------------------------------------2----------------------------------------3

There are two types of agents in equal numbers: doctors and builders. The doctors want to
consume building services and the builders want to consume doctor services. Doctors and
builders can consume wheat in any period and there is no discounting. Both doctors and builders
have an endowment of wheat in period 1 equal to e . As will become clear we will assume that e
is “large”.
We write agents’ utilities as:
1
Doctors: U d  xd  bd  ld 2
2
1
Builders: U b  xb  db  lb 2
2

where xi is the sum of the quantities of wheat consumed by individual i  d , b in each period; bd
is the quantity of building services consumed by the doctors; l d is the labor supplied by the
doctors; d b is the quantity of doctor services consumed by the builders; and lb is the labor
6

supplied by the builders. We assume constant returns to scale: one unit of builder labor yields
one unit of building services and one unit of doctor labor yields one unit of doctor services. We
normalize the price of wheat to be 1 in all periods. Let pb and pd be the price respectively of
building and doctor services. In words, doctors and builders have a constant marginal utility of
wheat, a constant marginal utility of the service provided by the other group of agents, and a
quadratic disutility of labor.
In period 1 each agent learns whether he will first buy or sell. Ex ante both events are
equally likely. For convenience, we assume that in the east side of town doctors buy builders’
services in period 2, while builders buy doctors’ services in period 3. In the west side of town,
the order is reversed. After each agent learns whether he will first buy or sell (equivalently,
whether he is in the east or west side of town), he can invest part of his wheat endowment in a
project that pays off at the end of period 3 (in the form of wheat), and whose return is R >1; the
rest of the endowment is (costlessly) stored. For the moment we take the return from the
investment project to be perfectly certain. The investment opportunity is specific to the agent.
We have deliberately set up the model to be very symmetric; this helps with the welfare
comparisons later.
In periods 2 and 3 the market meets and the doctors and builders trade in the order
determined in period 1. Throughout the paper we will analyze the east part of town, where
doctors buy in period 2 and builders in period 3; the reverse case is completely symmetrical.
We assume there are many doctors and many builders, and so the prices for both services
are determined competitively. It is crucial for our analysis that there is no simultaneous double
coincidence of wants: builders and doctors are in either the market for buying or the market for
selling: they cannot do both at the same time. Hence, even if the builder a doctor buys from
wants the doctor services from his customer, he cannot buy them at the same time as he is selling
building services.

2.1 A benchmark: the Walrasian equilibrium
In an ideal world the doctors could pledge to pay the builders out of income from
supplying doctor services that they will earn in period 3 and from the return from their
investment project. This is the assumption made in classic Walrasian or Arrow-Debreu theory
and it is easy to compute the Walrasian equilibrium.
7

Clearly both the doctors and the builders invest all their endowment in the investment
project since this maximizes their wealth; and under complete markets maximizing wealth is a
necessary condition for maximizing utility. Thus, a doctor solves the following maximization
problem:
1
Max xd  bd  ld2
2

(2.1)

xd  pb bd  pd ld  eR .

S.T.
The solution is

ld  p d

(2.2)

=

pd
pb

if

pb  1

if

pb  1

bd  0

bd 

if
pd2 eR

pb2 pb

0  bd 

pb  1

if pb  1

pd2 eR

pb2 pb

if pb  1

The intuition is that, if pb  1 , doctors prefer wheat to building services, if pb  1 they are
indifferent, and, if pb  1 , they prefer building services. The marginal utility of wealth for doctors
is 1 if pb  1 and

1
if pb  1 , and this affects their labor supply decision. If pb  1 , doctors
pb

p
1
1
choose labor supply to maximize pd ld  ld2 ; and, if pb  1 , they maximize d ld  ld2 .
2
pb
2
Similarly, a builder solves:
(2.3)

1
Max xb  d b  lb2
2

S.T.

xb  pd d b  pb lb  eR .

The solution is
(2.4)

lb  pb

if

pd  1

8

=

pd

if

pd  1

db  0

db 

pb2 eR

pd2 pd

pb2 eR
0  db  2 
pd pd

if

pd  1

if pd  1
if pd  1

Again the marginal utility of wealth for builders is 1 if pd  1 and

1
if pd  1 .
pd

For markets to clear we must have

(2.5)

bd  lb

(2.6)

d b  ld

On the one hand, (2.5) and (2.6) cannot be satisfied if either pb  1 or pd  1 (demand will be
less than supply for building/doctor services, respectively). On the other hand, we cannot have
both pb  1 and pd  1 because then the demand for wheat would be zero, while the supply is
e R ((2.5) and (2.6) imply that the wheat market clears). Hence, either pb  1 and pd  1 , or
pb  1 , pd  1 , or pb  pd  1 . It is easily seen that the first case is inconsistent with (2.5) and

the second with (2.6).
We are left with pb  pd  1 . It is immediate that (2.2)-(2.6) hold if bd  lb  d b  ld  1 .
Hence, we have established
Proposition 1: In the unique Walrasian equilibrium all wheat is invested
1
and pb  pd  bd  lb  d b  ld  1 . The utilities of the doctors and builders are U d  eR  ,
2
U b  eR 

1
, respectively, and total welfare (social surplus) equals W  U d  U b  2eR  1 .
2

9

Note that the Walrasian allocation and prices are independent of the initial endowment e
and R (except for consumption of wheat, which varies one to one with e R ). Also the Walrasian
equilibrium achieves maximal social surplus; this follows from the first theorem of welfare
economics and the symmetry of the parties. In what follows we will refer to the Walrasian
equilibrium allocation as the first best.

3. Introducing Banks
We now suppose that parties cannot pledge their future labor income or investment
income—the returns from these activities can be diverted or hidden. We also assume that it is
impossible for individuals to carry wheat around with them when they trade; it is too
cumbersome or the wheat would rot or be stolen. In the absence of any further assumption the
model now becomes trivial. Trade between doctors and builders is impossible—they have
nothing to trade with— and so each agent invests and eats his wheat in period 3. We have
U d  eR and U b  eR .

However, we now introduce storage facilities. These storage facilities are perfectly
secure in the sense that wheat deposited at a facility in period 1 will remain there and be intact at
the end of period 3.
Storage per se does not change anything since there is no advantage to doctors from
storing wheat rather than consuming it right away. However, let us suppose that claims can be
issued on the wheat deposited in a storage facility. In particular, if a doctor deposits f units of
wheat he will receive f notes, where each note is a claim on a unit of wheat at the end of period
3; he can then use these notes to pay builders. The builders in turn can use these notes to pay
doctors. At the end of period 3 the holders of the notes can go to the storage facility and redeem
them for an equal number of units of wheat. We call these storage facilities banks. At the
moment, these are completely passive institutions, which just store and issue notes on a one-forone basis.

3.1 Individual optimization
Let’s consider first the doctors. In period 1, a doctor invests e  f d units of wheat in the
investment project and deposits f d units of wheat in the bank, receiving f d in notes. In period 2
10

he uses these notes to purchase

fd
units of building services. In period 3, he will choose l d to
pb

1
maximize pd ld  ld2 , i.e., set ld  pd . Note that it is too late for the doctor to buy more building
2

services and so his marginal return from work is pd rather than

pd
. A doctor’s labor yields
pb

revenue pd2 in the form of notes, which he redeems for wheat at the end of period 3; in addition
he incurs an effort cost of

1 2
1
pd , and so his net utility is pd2 . Finally, he will also receive and
2
2

consume the payoff from his investment in the form of wheat.
Therefore, a doctor’s (expected) utility when he buys first is

(3.1)

fd 1 2
 pd  ( e  f d ) R .
pb 2

Each doctor chooses f d to maximize (3.1), taking prices as given. The first order condition for
an interior solution is
(3.2)

1
 R.
pb

Similarly, a builder’s utility is

f b 1 pb2

 (e  f b ) R .
pd 2 pd2
Note that a builder’s marginal return from work is

pb
, since she will use her income to buy
pd

doctor services. We shall see shortly that builders will be a corner, so their first order condition is
(3.3)

1
R.
pd

3.2 Market Equilibrium

11

We solve for the equilibrium under the conjecture that fb  0 . Since only f d  0 , we will
drop the subscript and set f d  f . We also conjecture that pd and pb are less than one. In due
course we will show that these conjectures are correct.
We work backwards, starting with the market for doctors in period 3. After the doctors
have bought building services, the builders find themselves with a quantity f of notes. Hence,
their demand for doctor services will be given by
(3.4)

f
.The supply of doctor services is
pd

ld  p d .

Hence, market clearing requires

f
 pd .
pd

(3.5)

Similarly, the market-clearing condition in the building services market is
(3.6)

p
f
 b
pb pd

since the labor supply of builders is

pb
. Combining this with (3.5) yields
pd
1

(3.7)

3

pd  f 2 , pb  f 4 .

Substituting the equilibrium price into (3.2) we have:

(3.8)

f



3
4

R

or
1
f= fˆ  4
R3

12

where we assume that e is larger than fˆ , so the solution is not at the corner. Since R >1, fˆ <1,
which implies 1> pd  pb . Hence (3.3) holds as an inequality and the builders will be at a corner
solution with fb  0 , as initially conjectured.
1
f
Note that the level of trade of doctors’ services is
 f 2  1 and of builders’ services is
pd
1
f
 f 4  1. In other words trade levels are lower than in the Walrasian equilibrium. (Recall that
pb

in the Walrasian equilibrium pd = pb =1 and one unit of each service is traded.)

Proposition 2: If R >1 and e > fˆ , there is less trade and prices are lower in the market
equilibrium when agents cannot pledge future income than in the Walrasian equilibrium.

3.3 Social Optimum
Obviously the market equilibrium is not first best optimal given that it operates below the
Walrasian equilibrium level of trade. We now show that the market equilibrium is also not
second best optimal: a planner operating under the same constraints as the market can do better.
Recall that ex ante it is not known who will buy first: doctors or builders. Thus the expected
utility of each group is

1
1
U d  U b .The social optimum is obtained by maximizing U d + U b
2
2

taking into account the effect of f on prices.

That is, the planner maximizes
1

(3.9)

U d + Ub =

f4

1
1 1
f  f 2  (e  f ) R  eR .
2
2

The first order condition is
(3.10)

1  34 1 1  12
f   f R.
4
2 4

Comparing the left-hand side of (3.8) and (3.10) we have
Proposition 3: If R >1 and e > fˆ , the market equilibrium leads to an excessive amount of private
money f, and an excessive trade level, relative to the second best social optimum.
13

Proof: Since the l.h.s. of both (3.8) and (3.10) are decreasing in f, to prove that the solution of
(3.8) is large than the solution of (3.10) it is enough to show that
can be rewritten as

f



3
4



1  34 1 1  12
f   f . This
4
2 4

1

1  34
1 3
( f  1)  ( f 4  f 2 )  0 , which is true as long as f  1 . When f=1,
2
4

the inequality becomes an equality. Trade levels are higher in the market equilibrium since
equilibrium trade levels, given by f

1
2

for doctor services and f

1
4

for building services, are

monotonically increasing in f .
The social and private returns from varying f are illustrated in Figure 1.
[Figure 1 here]
There are two types of inefficiency. With respect to the Walrasian equilibrium, there is too little
trade but at the same time too much wheat is invested in liquidity-creating unproductive storage
instead of productive projects. This inefficiency is due to the lack of pledgeabilty of future
income. In the Walrasian equilibrium there is no liquidity problem since future (labor) income
can be pledged and so no wheat is invested in unproductive storage. In addition, there is an
inefficiency with respect to the second best. The creation of more means of payments imposes a
positive externality on the builders (who see the price of their building services go up) and a
negative externality on the other doctors (who see the price of what they are buying go up). In
standard models the effect of these “pecuniary” externalities is second order and thus does not
create a divergence between social and private optimality. Here, however, while the positive
externality on other builders is second order, the negative externality on other doctors is first
order, since the doctors are liquidity constrained. (The builders who sell before they buy are not
liquidity constrained.) Thus the market equilibrium yields too much liquidity and too much trade
relative to the second best, even though too little trade relative to the first best.
Notice that if R =1, the social and private solutions do not differ: they are both f  1 ( as
long as e  1 ). In this case the first best is achieved. There is still a divergence between private
and social incentives, but this divergence is infra-marginal.
As we have noted, as long as R  1 , the economy will operate below the Walrasian
equilibrium level of trade, regardless of the quantity of endowment e. Because high return
projects cannot be collateralized, and the only investments that can be collateralized (wheat
14

storage) have a lower yield, there is an opportunity cost of creating liquidity. Thus the optimal
amount of liquidity is too low from a first best efficiency point of view: in the first best there
would be enough liquidity to generate a trade of one unit of each service. This conclusion is
reminiscent of Friedman (1969)’s famous result that with a non-negative rate of inflation people
hold too little money. In Friedman, however, this inefficiency is in the form of a shoe-leather
cost; here it is in the form of missed trading opportunities. The ultimate source of inefficiency in
our paper is lack of pledgeability: the inefficiency would disappear if all labor income could be
pledged or if the return from the non-collateralizeable investments were equal to 1.

3.4 Overproduction of collateral

In our model there are three types of activities: non-collateralizeable investments (high
return projects), collateralizeable investments (low return storage), and future labor income.
Interestingly, it would be natural to think that if future labor income is contractible, the
inefficiency would disappear. In Section 4 we show this is not the case.
Note that if some high return projects are (or become) collateralizeable, their prices will

1
jump from to
R

2

1
  , since they can be used both to produce R in period 3 and to buy goods
R

in period 1, which has a return of

1
 R . This conclusion can be generalized: assets that can be
pb

collateralized to back credit will trade at a higher price than otherwise identical assets that cannot
be collateralized to produce credit. As a result, if we add an early period where effort is exerted
to produce various assets, there will be an overproduction of assets that can be collateralized to
produce liquidity (Madrigan and Philippon, 2011). Therefore, there will be excess resources
invested in collateralizeable assets and/or an overproduction of low-yielding assets that can be
collateralized to produce liquidity, a result similar to the one Madrigan and Philippon (2011)
obtain for houses.

4. Bank Lending
Let’s now consider the case where banks have some ability to seize payments that go through the
banking sector. Specifically, suppose that all payments for building and doctor services take
place through check transfers and that the bank is able to seize these before they are cashed for
15

consumption. In other words, labor income is now contractible. However, a bank cannot force
anyone to work: human capital is inalienable (as in Hart and Moore (1994)). That is, all a bank
can do is to ensure that someone who defaults has zero consumption, apart from their investment
income.
We continue to assume that investment income cannot be seized. In Section 6.1 we show
that with a different timing of the model this assumption can be relaxed.
Given that doctors go first, only doctors will want to borrow. Builders, who buy second,
will obtain no advantage from borrowing. A bank, knowing that it will have no power over
builders at the end of period 3, will insist on being repaid before it approves the builders’
payment to doctors. But then builders will have to repay their debt before they buy doctors’
services, making their borrowing useless.
Let  be the amount borrowed by each doctor. By borrowing an amount  an
individual doctor can consume


pb

of building services, which is attractive if he has to pay back

only  ( given pb <1). Of course, a bank needs to make sure that it will be repaid. In period 3, a
doctor exerts

1 2
pd of effort, receiving in exchange pd2 in terms of payment. His net utility is
2

1 2
1
pd . Thus, he cannot borrow more than pd2 : if he did he would prefer not to work in period 3,
2
2

default, and consume nothing (except for his investment income).
A doctor’s utility is now given by
f  1 2
 pd    (e  f ) R .
pb
2

(4.1)

Notice that given pb  1 , a doctor’s utility is increasing in  ; thus a doctor will borrow up to the
constraint.
The equilibrium in the market for doctors’ services will be given by
f 
 pd
pd
and the equilibrium in the market for building services will be given by

Since doctors will borrow as much as possible we will have

(4.2)
Hence,

where fˆ is the solution of (3.8) when there was no borrowing and fˆ is the solution of (4.3)

when there is borrowing. Since 2 fˆ = fˆ , it follows that the presence of lending keeps prices

constant. However, lending cuts in half the amount of wheat that is notified, reducing welfare
losses, since more can be invested productively. Without lending e - fˆ is invested in the risky
ˆ
project, while with lending, the investment rises to e  fˆ .

ˆ
It is easy to see that U d ( fˆ )  U d ( fˆ ) , since

The planning solution is obtained by maximizing the sum of the utilities of a doctor and a builder
(i.e., the expected utility of each):
W

 pd  (e  f ) R    ( b ) 2  eR .

Substituting the value of pd and pb , we obtain

Thus, the FOC is

3

(2 f ) 4  (2 f ) 2  R .

(4.4)

By comparing (4.3) and (4.4) we have

Proposition 4: If R >1, the market equilibrium leads to an excessive amount of private money
even in the presence of lending. Lending, however, increases welfare.
Proof: Since the l.h.s. of both (4.3) and (4.4) are decreasing in f, to prove that the solution of
(4.3) is larger than the solution of (4.4) it is enough to show that (2 f )
or (2 f )

 (2 f ) 2 , which is always true since 2 f  1 by (4.3).

Lending, thus, does not resolve the tension between private and social objectives.
Nevertheless, lending does improve welfare since it increases the volume of trade without
sacrificing the higher return of the alternative investment. Interestingly, lending is not a perfect
substitute for the notification of wheat. To see why, look at equation (4.2). The amount of
feasible lending is directly related to the amount of notes present in the system. The reason is that
lending faces a repayment constraint. With no notes in the system, the amount borrowed by
doctors equals the purchasing power in the hands of builders, which in turn equals the revenue
received by doctors for their services. But if the revenue equals the debt, it is not in the interest
of the doctors to work, given that they have to exert costly effort. Hence, the doctors will default.
To have a functioning lending market, we need a minimum amount of deposits.

18

Finally, it is important to emphasize that we have only scratched the surface of
borrowing. If we introduce uncertainty in the proceeds from trade, then borrowing will be risky.
(In principle it could be state-contingent.) Some loans may not be repaid, which might cause
some banks not to be able to honor their claims. This may lead to contagion effects, as
consumers cannot redeem claims and in turn default, leading other banks to default. (Contagion
effects are analyzed in Kiyotaki and Moore (1997), (2002).) The analysis becomes much more
complex, and richer, and we hope to explore the consequences in future work.

5. Interaction between private and public money
So far we have ignored any role of the government in providing liquidity. In this finite
horizon economy, to introduce government money we need to specify why it is accepted.
Following a long tradition (e.g., Cochrane (1998)), we assume that government money is
valuable because one can pay taxes with it. We suppose that each agent receives an amount m of
government money in period 2 after investments have been made but before any trading takes
place, and will have to pay some taxes in period 3. We assume that the agent has an option to pay
taxes either in dollars or an equal number of units of wheat. This anchors the value of money.
In this type of model, it is generally assumed that taxation takes the form of a nondistortionary lump sum tax. What is ignored is that even a lump sum tax has some potential
distortions. What happens if an individual refuses to pay the lump sum tax? Presumably, he
would be thrown in jail. To make this a credible threat, however, the government would have to
build prisons in advance, which is in itself distortionary.
Rather than working with a lump sum tax and a jail threat (the results are similar but less
elegant), we prefer to use a standard model of a distortionary tax, such as a consumption tax.
Specifically, we assume that the government can impose a mill tax on those who turn wheat into
flour.
Assume that each agent can obtain  units of flour in period 3 at the cost of

1 2
c units of
2

wheat. This activity occurs at facilities that can easily be monitored by the government, and so
the sales tax cannot be avoided. One unit of flour yields one unit of utility. An agent’s utility is
now:

19

1
1
Doctors: U d  xd  bd  ld 2  (1  t )d  cd 2
2
2
1
1
Builders: U b  xb  d b  lb 2  (1  t )b  cb 2
2
2

where t is the tax rate on flour.
We assume that this transformation from wheat into flour can be financed out of the
return from the investment. We suppose that this return is always high enough so that agents are
not at a corner solution, and so d , b satisfy the first order condition

d  b 

Hence, budget balance for the government implies

5.1 No private borrowing
For simplicity let’s start with the case where there is no private borrowing. Consider the market
for doctors. The number of notes in the hands of builders will be f+m (from trading with doctors)
plus m of their own. Thus, market equilibrium is given by
f  2m
 pd .
pd

(5.3)

We assume that f  2m  1 ; otherwise (5.3) would be replaced by pd =1.
On the other hand, in the market for builders the number of notes available to doctors is

f+m, so the market equilibrium is given by
f  m pb

.
pb
pd

(5.4)
Solving (5.3) and (5.4) yields
1

(5.5)

pd  ( f  2m) 2

1

and

1

pb  ( f  m) 2 ( f  2m) 4 .

We can write the utilities of doctors and builders as
(5.6)

where we use (5.1) to substitute for d , b .
The competitive equilibrium is characterized by the first order condition of (5.6) with
respect to f, where prices are taken as given:
1
 R.
pb

(5.7)

As noted we require the solution to (5.5) and (5.7) to satisfy f  2m  1 for these formulae to be
correct. This will be true as long as m is not too large. We assume this in what follows.
In contrast, the planner maximizes W  U d  U b taking into account the effects of f and

m on prices. In other words, the planner maximizes

Several questions are worth asking. First, starting at the competitive equilibrium, does the
planner want to introduce outside money, i.e., m  0 , given that the market will adjust to a new
competitive equilibrium? The answer seems to be ambiguous, perhaps because the market
provides too much of its own money (sets f too high).
A second question is: given that the planner can regulate f, does she want to set m  0 ?
Here the answer is affirmative. To see this, set f at the regulatory optimum, i.e., maximize W
with respect to f when m  0 (this is equivalent to maximizing (3.9)). Now consider a small
change in m (or equivalently in t). By the envelope theorem,

21

since (5.5) and (5.8) imply f  1 when m  0 (given R  1 ). It follows that it is always better for
the planner to set m  0 than m  0 .
A third question is: given that the regulator can choose m (and t) optimally, does
she want to set f  0 , i.e., does outside money crowd out private money? Here the answer is: it
depends. It is clear from (5.10) that f is small when R is large. In fact one can go further:

dW
df

f 0

<0 when R is large at the optimal m, and so the socially optimal f is zero for large

enough R . On the other hand, we have seen that when R is close to 1 the private market
equilibrium approximates the first best, and so private money is more efficient than outside
money. We can carry out a similar exercise for variations in c. If c is small the deadweight costs
of taxation are small and so outside money is more efficient than private money; the socially
optimal f will be close to zero. On the other hand, if c is large, then the maximum possible value
of m (given by

1
) is small.1 In other words, a pure outside money economy will achieve very
4c

little trade, and private money by itself can do better. Thus, the optimal f is bigger than zero.
In summary, private money and government money have different costs and benefits
and hence are not perfect substitutes. Private money is costly because it crowds out productive
investment. Government money is costly because it is backed by distortionary taxes that create
deadweight losses.

5.2 Case with private borrowing
We now show that our result that some outside money is optimal ( m  0 ) generalizes to the case
of borrowing. In the presence of private borrowing (5.3) and (5.4) are replaced by
(5.12)

f    2m
 pd
pd

and the equilibrium in the market for building services will be given by
(5.13)

f    m pb

For these formula to apply we need f    2m  1 . We then have

1

This maximum value of m can be obtained from maximizing (5.2) with respect to t.

pd  ( f    2m) 2

, which we know to be the case from (4.3). Hence, it is optimal to set m  0 .
2
Interestingly, the introduction of government money does not eliminate the role for bank

lending. In fact, it is complementary to bank lending, as shown by equation (5.15). The reason is
similar to the one highlighted in Section 4: With no notes in the system, the amount borrowed by
doctors equals the purchasing power in the hands of builders, which in turn equals the revenue
received by doctors for their services. But if the revenue equals the debt, it is not in the interest
of the doctors to work, given that they have to exert costly effort. To have a functioning lending
market, thus, we need either private or outside money. Lending multiplies the effect from the
injection of money.

5.3 Pigovian Taxation
So far we have only considered government money backed by a distortionary tax. In
Section 3, however, we showed that the competitive equilibrium produced too much liquidity
23

and that that government intervention could improve welfare. In this context it is natural to
wonder whether a Pigovian tax on deposits can kill two birds with one stone: raise revenue to
support more government money while decreasing the inefficiency associated with notification.
Surprisingly, the answer is that such a scheme will not work: the reason is that the tax
will be raised at the same time deposits are made, worsening the constraint that agents face.
Formally, let’s assume that the government can require that anybody who deposits at a bank
chooses a particular f and pays a total tax t.2We will show that the welfare maximizing t equals
zero, i.e. the government does not want to impose any Pigovian tax.
A deposit tax will be assessed only on the early buyers (according to our convention, the
doctors) since these are the only ones who deposit wheat. The total amount of money that can be
supported by the tax revenue is M=t . Since the government cannot tell who needs to buy first,
the money will be distributed equally between doctors and builders, each agent receiving an
amount m=

t
.
2

Thus, the doctors will enter the buying phase with an amount of liquidity equal to

f  t  m and the builders, who will be paid by the doctors that amount, will enter their buying
phase with an amount f  t  2m .
The equilibrium in the doctors’ market requires that

f  t  2m
 pd ,
pd

(5.18)
1

which yields pd  f 2 .
The equilibrium in the builders’ market requires that

(5.19)

f  t  m pb

,
pb
pd

1 1 1
which yields pb  ( f  t ) 2 f 4 .
2

2

One way for the government to do this is for them to impose a 100% marginal tax on deposits above f .
24

The expected utility of the doctors is given by

f t  m 1 2
 pd  (e  f ) R , while the
2
pb

m 1  pb 
expected utility of the builders is given by

subject to (5.18), (5.19) , and the doctors’ individual rationality constraint (a doctor must be
willing to deposit in a bank and pay the tax rather than deposit nothing).

Proposition 5: It is optimal for the government to set t equal to zero.
Proof: Fix f. If we compare the expected utility at t  m  0 and the expected utility when

 0 when f  1 . Thus, the l.h.s. is always
4 12
f

as big as the r.h.s. and the welfare is maximized at t  m  0 .

In most situations in which the social optimum differs from the competitive
equilibrium, the social optimum can be implemented with a simple linear tax. Proposition 5
implies that this is not the case. Even if an appropriate linear tax can restore the right incentive
on the margin, it will be suboptimal, since it will raise revenues, worsening the constraints of
doctors.
25

The optimal level of deposits can be implemented with a nonlinear tax t  0 if
f  f * and t  f if f  f * , since in equilibrium this tax will raise no revenues. Yet, this tax is
very informational intensive. It requires the planner to know the optimal level of deposits for
each individual. This is trivial in the model, since everybody is the same, but it is not in reality.
In reality, however, there are better ways to deal with this problem, which do not require
so much information. Since what matters is the aggregate level of deposits, the planner can limit
herself to controlling that instead. Even with multiple banks, she can do this by issuing a fixed
number of permits and allowing banks to accept deposits only if they own the right amount of
permits.
This is exactly what central banks do with reserve requirements. The central bank
requires each bank to deposit a fraction of its own deposits at the central bank. In this way a bank
can accept a deposit only if it has enough deposits at the central bank. Thus, by controlling the
level of its own deposits, a central bank can control the level of deposits in all the banks and (in
this simple economy) the liquidity of the overall system.3

6 Extensions
6.1 Banks investing in high return projects
We have assumed that high return projects can be undertaken only by the agents and not by the
banks. What would happen if the banks could undertake the high return projects too? In this
case each doctor would deposit all his endowment in the bank in exchange for shares in the
bank’s assets (in proportion to his fraction of the total funds deposited). These shares would then
be used for trading. The doctors would endorse these shares to the builders in exchange for
building services and the builders would further endorse them to doctors when they buy their
services. There is no longer a trade-off between unproductive investments that provide liquidity
and productive investments that don’t. The first best can be achieved if agents invest all their
endowment in the productive project as long as eR  1 .
A similar conclusion is reached if only individuals can invest in productive projects as
long as these projects can be collateralized, i.e., their returns fully pledged.

3

This example applies to a situation of fiat money not of specie money, as in our model. However, even in a specie
money economy central banks control the total amount of deposits with some fractional reserve.
26

We now show that these conclusions change if the high return projects are risky, highly
correlated, and some uncertainty about their returns is resolved before the two rounds of trading.
In this case the value of the notes backed by risky investments is volatile. Although individual
agents are risk neutral, the transactional role played by money makes them risk-averse vis-à-vis
fluctuations in the value of notes.
Agents dislike the uncertainty about the value of their claims because if the value of their
claims drops below 1, the economy operates below full potential, while if the value of the claims
is above 1, no extra benefits are generated.
Let’s consider the case where banks can invest in the same projects as individuals.
Suppose that each bank can choose how to divide its deposits between a risky project with an
expected return of R and a safe project, and this choice is perfectly contractible, so there is no
moral hazard involved. Let’s also assume that uncertainty about returns gets fully resolved
before the first round of trading. Finally, we assume that the risky projects are perfectly
correlated and have the following payoff per dollar (constant return to scale):
R
R 
with probability 

(6.1)



=0

with probability 1- 

The expected return of the investment is R ,which exceeds 1. In this section we will focus on the
limiting case where   0 and the investment becomes infinitely risky.
In this set up, since banks can commit to the mix of safe and risky investments, it is easy
to show that doctors will deposit all their wheat e in the banks. (Builders will continue to invest
in their own projects.) Thus, the crucial variable is the proportion  of deposits that a typical
bank invests in the riskless asset (storage),where 1   is invested in the risky project.
Since trading will take place with banks’ shares, the equilibrium prices will differ
according to the state that is realized before the beginning of trading. Denote prices in the bad
state by p b , p d and in the good state by pbg , pdg .
With probability 1   the risky investment will yield zero, the riskless asset one, and the
value of a doctor’s claim will be  e . By contrast, with probability  the risky investment will
yield

and the value of the doctor’s claim will be  e  (1   )

which is identical to (3.9) with  e  f . Thus we have

Proposition 6. When uncertainty is resolved before trading takes place, the model of this section
with trading in bank shares is equivalent to the model of Section 3 with trading in fixed claims
on deposits.
The intuition is that in the good state of the world the economy has plenty of liquidity
and so the Walrasian equilibrium is realized. Since this state occurs with negligible probability,
however, the value of liquidity in this state is very small. Thus liquidity is provided by the safe
investment, which pays off in the bad state. The risky investment still has value in expected
28

terms but only because it provides a huge amount of extra wheat consumption in the good state.
For these reasons banks will hold a mix of safe and risky investments, just as individual doctors
do in the model of Section 3. In the limit the two models are equivalent.
6.2 Non-competitive banks
So far we have treated banks as purely passive institutions. In this subsection we explore
how the results change once we allow banks to be of non-negligible size and to behave
strategically. We start with the conjecture that, as in the competitive case, the only agents who
want to deposit are doctors. We will then verify this conjecture.
Let us assume that there is a fixed number of banks,

1



, where 0<  <1. Each bank serves

a fraction  of the doctors. For simplicity we assume that each bank is a monopolist with respect
to its constituency of doctors; however, we doubt that much would change if we allowed several
banks to compete for the same constituency of doctors.
Note that the case  =0 can be interpreted as the (limiting) situation where every doctor
can set up his own bank. In what follows we will report the results only for mutual (or
cooperative) banks. Considering outside-owned banks will not ameliorate matters; in fact, it
would make them worse.
We assume that each bank offers the doctors in its constituency the following service: a
doctor can deposit an amount of wheat up to  and receive notes (or checks) equal to  . Hence,

 is a policy instrument of the bank, which is the same for all customers; moreover, we assume
that the bank can announce and commit to it.
If   fˆ obtained in (3.8), then each doctor will set f  fˆ and the bank policy would be
irrelevant. Hence, we focus on the possibility that   fˆ , where each doctor will deposit the full
amount allowed,  .
Consider a single bank’s choice of  given that the bank serves a fraction  of the

population of doctors and that the average choice of other banks is  . We know from Section 2.2
that even if every doctor deposits as much as he wants, then pb  1 and p d  1 . A fortiori this
must be true when   fˆ . Thus we can focus on situations where pb  1 and p d  1 .
The doctor’s utility will be given by



pd  (e   ) R .

The mutual bank chooses  to maximize the utility of a representative member, given by
(6.5), taking into account the effect of the bank’s choice of  on prices p b and p d .
Let us consider this price effect. Given  the total value of notes in circulation will be

  (1   ) ; the first term represents the contribution of this bank and the second term the
contribution of the other banks. Since doctors use all their notes on building services, the demand
for building services is


  (1   )

(6.6)

pb

while the supply is, as in (2.4),

(6.7)

,

pb
. Equating these yields
pd


pb2  (  (1   ) ) pd .

In the market for doctors, demand is


(6.8)

  (1   )
pd

,

since the builders use all the notes received from doctors to buy doctor services; and supply is

pd . Combining this with (6.3) yields

(6.9)


pb  (  (1   ) ) 4

,

1


pd  (  (1   ) ) 2 .

Substituting into (6.2), we see that the utility of a representative doctor at the bank choosing  is

We study a Nash equilibrium in which each bank chooses  to maximize (6.10), taking

 as given. Let y    (1   ) and z  (1   ) . Then, maximizing (6.10) is equivalent to
maximizing

with respect to y. It is easy to see that (6.11) is strictly concave in y. Thus, there is a unique

maximizer y and hence a unique maximizer  of (6.10), given  .
Moreover, the optimal y is strictly increasing in z. It follows that, if two different banks
choose different values of sigma in equilibrium, i.e., they face different values of z, then they
will choose different values of y. But y equals the average value of sigma over all banks, and
must therefore be the same for each bank. It follows that the equilibrium sigma is the same for all
banks, i.e., any Nash equilibrium is symmetric.
Differentiating (6.10) and setting   ˆ , we may conclude that the equilibrium level of

 , if 0    1 , satisfies

Let’s now verify the conjecture that builders do not want to deposit any of their wheat. Define

 d* to be the solution of (6.12).This is the equilibrium level if and only if the builders do not
want to deposit any more wheat. The utility of a builder who deposits  b is given by

b
pd

 (e   b ) R .

Thus, no builder wants to deposit if

Substituting the equilibrium level of pd   d* 2 we have

As long as (6.13) is satisfied (which is certainly true for a big enough R ), the solution determined
by (6.12) is an equilibrium. As is easy to see, the level of R for which (6.13) is satisfied depends
on  . For   0 , (6.13) is satisfied for any R  1 . For   0.25 , (6.13) is satisfied for R  1.23.
Having established that (6.12) characterizes an equilibrium if (6.13) is satisfied, we can
compare it with (3.10) to obtain:
Proposition 7. In a competitive market (  close to 0) banks choose too high a level of deposits
with respect to what is socially efficient. In a monopolistic market (  =1) banks choose too low
a level of deposits with respect to what is socially efficient.
Proof: For   0 , (6.12) becomes (3.8) and the previous result applies. For   1 the l.h.s. of
(6.12) becomes 



to show that

The intuition for the competition result is as before. The intuition for the monopolist one
is simple. Large mutual banks restrict  , i.e., issue too few notes, to lower the price of building
services; this helps their members since their members consume these services. In doing this,
however, large banks ignore the positive externality they impose on builders, who gain from high
prices since this allows them to buy more doctor services. Small banks choose a high  because
their impact on prices is limited.
When it comes to builders, they cannot create liquidity to increase the price of their own
services; hence, they face a trade-off similar to before: increasing their own purchasing power at
the expense of the return on their investments.
Since a competitive banking sector generates too much liquidity and a monopolistic one
too little, by continuity there exists a level of oligopoly  that delivers the efficient level of
private money. Note, however, that this level is contingent upon R ; thus if the level of R changes
with the business cycle, so does the level of competition that delivers the first best. In other
words, unless the government can somehow fine tune the level of competition over time, this
does not seem a very reliable method to achieve the first best level of money.

7. Implications for the nature of money
What is money? In our model money is a relatively safe asset that overcomes a
pledgeability problem in a world where labor income is contractible but not fully pledgeable,
because workers can quit. The need for this relatively safe asset arises for transactional purposes.
Transactional needs generate a form of risk aversion even in risk neutral people. When an agent
has the opportunity/desire to buy, having twice as much pledgeable wealth in some states does
not compensate her for the risk of having half as much in other states, because in the latter states
she is wealth constrained. As a result, agents are willing to hold relatively safe assets even if they
have a lower yield.
In our model the cost of money is represented by its opportunity cost. Ideally, the best
money is an asset that is valuable (in a fine horizon economy one needs a desirable asset to make
the pledge credible) and whose opportunity cost is low. Before the introduction of fiat money,
the main commodity that was used as money, gold, was not particularly useful per se. Hence, as
noted by Sargent and Wallace (1983), the inefficiency of commodity money was not the
distortion in the use of gold, but its overproduction.
Sargent and Wallace (1983) seem to suggest that the introduction of fiat money
eliminates this problem. In contrast, our model indicates that the partial non-pledgeability of
future labor income creates an additional demand for relatively safe assets. Hence, too many
resources are invested in manufacturing these relatively safe assets. An example of this
overproduction is the huge expansion of the finance sector in the first decade of the new
millennium, an expansion that cannot be explained by any of the traditional roles performed by
finance (Philippon (2008)). While the production of AAA mortgage-backed securities might
have been privately optimal, our model suggests that it was not necessarily socially optimal.

8. Conclusions
We have built a simple framework to analyze the general equilibrium implications of the
creation of liquidity by banks. To isolate these effects in this paper we consider either fullybacked money or lines of credit secured by a certain income stream. As a result there is no risk of
banks’ default. This risk is clearly a very important problem in reality, and we plan to consider it
in future work.
33

In a world where some assets can be collateralized and other assets cannot, our paper
shows that the assets that can be collateralized will trade at a premium with respect to what their
yield would imply. More surprisingly, our paper shows that the competitive equilibrium will lead
to an excess of collateralizeable assets. This distortion is present even if we introduce lending
and government money. The source of this distortion is a (pecuniary) externality that arises from
the creation of money. More money increases the equilibrium price of goods purchased by the
agents who are liquidity constrained (think, for example, of the effect of the relaxed credit on the
price of U.S. houses). This externality has welfare effects, because the buyers are liquidity
constrained. The government can remove this distortion by imposing a tax on deposits or by
restricting the creation of deposits through a reserve requirement. .
Our model also shows that this effect can be attenuated or even eliminated in a less than
competitive banking sector. Yet, we run the risk of the opposite problem: with too little
competition we will have too little liquidity. Therefore, it is unlikely that restricting competition
is the best way for the government to remove the externality that we have identified. It would be
better for the government to tackle the problem by directly targeting the creation of liquidity.
In our two period model, outside money is very costly because we compare its one period
benefit with the deadweight cost of taxation necessary to support it. If the number of periods
increases, the cost remains the same, but the benefits increase. In the limit, in an infinite horizon
model, it may be possible to support outside money without any cost. Hence, outside money may
be better able to reduce and possibly eliminate the inefficiency we have studied. We will
consider this possibility in future work.
