    "abstract": "\n\nWe analyze the effects of China\u2019s rapid export expansion following WTO entry on U.S. prices, exploiting cross-industry variation in trade liberalization. Lower input tariffs boosted Chinese firms\u2019 productivity, lowered costs, and, in conjunction with reduced U.S. tariff uncertainty, expanded export participation. We find that China\u2019s WTO entry significantly reduced variety-adjusted U.S. manufacturing price indexes between 2000 and 2006. For the Chinese components of these indexes, one third of the beneficial impact comes from Chinese exporters lowering their prices, while two-thirds of the beneficial impact comes from the entry of new Chinese exporters. China\u2019s WTO entry also led other countries exporting to the U.S. to lower their prices, which was partly offset by exit of these exporters. We find that this impact on competitor countries\u2019 prices is primarily explained by the reduction in China\u2019s own input tariffs, so that policy action becomes the largest source of welfare gain for the United States from China\u2019s WTO entry.\n\n",
