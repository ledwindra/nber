The Farm Labor Force by Region, 1820-1860:
Revised Estimates and Implications for Growth
ABSTRACT

This paper sets forth new estimates of the farm labor
force covering the period 1820 to 1860, for the United States

and the major geographic regions. At the national level, the

new figures are noticeably different from the previous
estimates.

In particular, the new estimates lower the 1820

farm labor force by about 8 percent, while raising the
figures for 1840, 1850, and 1860 by 7 to 10 percent. As a
consequence, the farm work force grew more rapidly than was
previously believed, while farm productivity and per capita

The interpretation of several key issues in U.S. economic

history rests on the size of and changes in the farm labor
force.

The simple description of the course of farm

productivity over the nineteenth century depends on the labor

input, and in turn the time series of farm productivity
influences our understanding of other issues. For the nation,

the rate of economic growth before 1840 depended crucially on

the course of farm labor productivity.

In Paul David's

conjectural estimates of per capita product for that early
period, increases in the farm labor force had a direct effect
on measured farm labor productivity, and an indirect effect, by

assumption, on the rate of advance in nonfarm industries. At

the same time, the labor force estimates determined the
interindustry shifts, and their impact on the overall level of

productivity. At the regional level, the performance of free

and slave based economies, and the effect of the "westward
movement" on the nation's performance was determined to a large
extent by the relative size and efficiency of the region's farm
sectors.

The pace and timing of industrialization in older

states and regions was closely tied to the slower growth and

eventual decline of the farm sector.

Moreover,

our

understanding of these events is determined by the estimates of
the true values of these farm statistics.

Over the past decade and a half, Robert Gallman has raised

doubts about the extant estimates of the antebellum farm labor
force figures. He first questioned the estimates of per capita
1

product in the years before 1840, on the grounds that the
levels of per capita product in the earlier years of the period

seem too low, because they implied implausible values for
nonperishable consumption and investment. Gailman argued that

the conjectures were quite sensitive to David's revisions of
Lebergott's labor force figures for 1800, 'particularly as the

changes affect the distribution of the total between sectors"
(1971, p.81).

In a subsequent article, Gallman questioned the time

pattern of farm productivity over the nineteenth century
implied by the Lebergott-David labor force estimates.

In

particular, those figures suggested unlikely changes in the

number of hours worked per farm worker; a 28—35 percent
increase in the first half century, and a 13-29 peercent
decline in the second half (1975, p.38).

Moreover, farm

productivity advanced more rapidly in the first half of the
century than in the latter half, a pattern that "runs counter

to the burden of the narrative histories of the period,"
(p.36).

In this instance, Gailman argued that the fault lay

with the 1850 labor force estimates rather than the 1800, and
suggested that the figure for that year was low by as many as
600,000 farm workers, or roughly 12 percent (p.50).

Whether or not Gailman is precisely correct in identifying

the years in which the labor force figures may be flawed, or

the exact extent of the error, he clearly raised serious
questions about the accuracy of the farm workforce series.
2

Because the farm sector was relatively larger in some regions,

and changed in importance at different rates, the biases and
their effects could have varied across regions.

I am currently preparing new estimates of the farm and
nonf arm labor force by state and region for the period 1800 to
1860.

These data will be linked to a set of figures for the

postbellum period, so the combined series will contain more
industrial and demographic detail than is presently available

at the state and regional level for the entire century. As a
by-product of careful estimation of these figures at the state
level the accuracy of the national totals should be increased.'

The estimation is not yet complete, so the discussion in
the present paper is confined to four years, 1820, 1840, 1850,
and 1860, for which the census provided some occupational data.
Because the estimates for the remaining years will draw heavily

upon the evidence for these four, it is desirable to establish
their accuracy before proceeding.

METHODS OF ESTIMATION

For the most part, my estimation follows Lebergott's
approach, but is executed at the state and regional level.2 In
concept and coverage, as well as the levels of the total labor

force, the two series are similar.3

Our estimates of the

antebellum agricultural labor force share in common that they

are based largely on the existing census statistics.

These

census counts were not flawless, but they were collected at
3

specific dates during the antebellum period so represent the
actual state of affairs, capturing the economic realities of
the time. In my work, I have reassessed and revised the census
data for 1820, 1840, 1850 and 1860, producing a clearer picture

of the age-sex coverage of each of those censuses.4

This

information in turn has permitted a more reliable revision of
the labor force data.

In addition, for 1820 and 1840, it is

possible to use the revised census data to estimate the number

of slaves engaged in farming. Let me summarize the key parts
of these assessments and revisions.

The 1850 and 1860 census counts of workers appear quite
accurate for the nation and most states, but the figures for
several states were extremely flawed.5 For the U.S., the 1850
count of free male workers aged 16 and over was revised upward
by less than one percent, with the Northeast being decreased by

one percent, the South being increased by one percent, and the

North Central being increased by three percent.6

The 1860

published census reported a combined figure for free male and

female workers aged 15 and over, but greater detail can be
found in the manuscript schedules.7 Samples of evidence taken
from the manuscripts suggest that the census figures include a
fairly reliable count of female workers, but some undercounting

of male workers, and that the biases varied by state. In sum,

the U.S. count of free workers was increased by 3.4 percent,
with no change in the Northeast, an increase of 6.9 percent in
the South, 7.4 percent in the North Central, and a decrease of
4

5.6 percent in the West.8

I assessed the 1820 and 1840 censuses in order to
determine which industries were covered, which age and sex

portions of the population were included in the counts of
workers, and which state counts were in need of revision.

Neither census covered all industries, but both reported
figures for agriculture, and for other commodity producing
industries.

However, there appears to be some difference in

age and sex coverage. The 1840 census reported on all workers
aged 10 and over, including slaves, although the accuracy and

completeness varied by county and state.

The 1820 counts

appear to cover free males aged 16 and over, and slaves aged 10

and over, but they, like the 1840 figures, were imperfect.

In

principle, then, we have a count of the entire farm work force

in 1840, and the bulk of it in 1820. In both years, the worst

anomalies in the census figures have been identified and
corrected; in 1820 the reported counts were supplemented by
estimates of the missing components, females aged 16 and over
and free males aged 10 to 15 years.9
The revisions were carried out by examining the county and

subdivision data, in much the same manner as had been done

before by Richard Easterlin (1960) and Stanley Lebergott
(1966). While the census counts included most slave workers,

they were incomplete so that the farm worker totals in most

slave states had to be revised.

Fortunately, the reported

figures in a large number of counties in the southern states
5

were accurate and could be used to correct those in other
counties, as explained below.

The corrections to the census counts of farm workers
amounted to 97,362 in 1820 and 168,195 in 1840; increases of
4.8 percent and 4.5 percent respectively)-0

The adjustments

varied by region. For 1820, I made virtually no corrections to

the North Central figures, and made the largest change, an
increase of 8.3 percent, in the South Central region.11

In

1840, the New England workforce was reduced by 5.3 percent,

while the largest upward correction was 7.5 percent in the
South Atlantic.

There are two aspects of my estimation which differ
substantially from the earlier work of Lebergott, Easterlin,
and David.

First, I have increased the farm labor force in

1850 and 1860, and thus indirectly in other antebellum years as

well, by the inclusion in that sector of an estimate of some
number of "laborers, not otherwise specified." Second, I have
produced a different set of estimates of the numbers of slaves

engaged in farming, which is based more heavily on the
available statistics.

The effect of these two factors is

discussed below.

RESULTS

The new estimates are presented, by region, in Table 1,
along with a set of "previous estimates" for comparison. The
latter are a combination of the estimates of Lebergott, David,
6

and Easterlin. In Table 2 the rates of change are presented.

At the national level, the present figures are higher than

the previous ones in 1840, 1850 and 1860, by a fairly uniform

percentage; 9 percent in 1840, 8 in 1850 and 7 in 1860.12
While the levels of the two series differ, they show roughly
the same growth over the period, as well as over each of the
two decades. This is true for both the absolute increases in
numbers of workers and the percentage changes.

There are some notable differences at the regional level.
In particular, the present estimates show higher levels of the

northeastern regions are similar or below the previous
estimates. In consequence, the shift out of agriculture during
the period 1840 to 1860, in New England and the Middle Atlantic

regions, occurred more rapidly than in the previous series. In

New England the farm labor force declined absolutely in both
decades.

ifl the other regions, the rates of change over each

of the decades are similar in the two series, the most obvious
difference being the slower growth in the North Central region
over the decade of the 1850's.

In sharp contrast, the new national totals for 1820 are

below the previous figures by approximately 8 percent, but
there is substantial variation across regions. The farm labor

force in both southern regions is higher than the earlier
7

estimates, while the northern figures are below the previous

ones by 15 to 20 percent.

The obvious consequence of these

changes, taken in conjunction with those for the period 1840 to

1860, is much faster growth of the farm labor force between
1820 and 1840, and slower growth of farm labor productivity.
While the farm workforce grows more rapidly now in all regions,

the sharpest difference is in New England, where there is now
an increase rather than a small decline.

These are rather striking changes in the statistical
record of the United States, and have substantial implications
for our understanding of economic growth before the Civil War.
Why are the new and previous estimates so different, and which
is the more reasonable series?

Differences in 1850 and 1860

The differences in the 1850 and 1860 values are the
easiest to explain.

In both years, the present estimates are

slightly higher due to a difference in the method of estimating
the number of farm workers aged 10 to 15 years.13

To maintain

consistency with the scope of coverage in other years, the
present figures for 1850 include an estimate of the number of
free females aged 16 and over engaged in f arming.14 The chief
reason for the higher level in the present series, however, is

the allocation of some laborers, not otherwise specified to
farming. This is offset to a substantial extent in both years

by the smaller number of slaves estimated to be engaged in

factors accounts for 79 percent of the difference in 1850 and
67 percent in 1860.

It is clear that any judgment about the

different series hinges on the acceptance of these two major
adjustments, the allocation of some laborers to farming and the
different estimate of the share of slaves engaged in farming.'5

A detailed examination of the census data at the state and

regional level makes clear that the category of workers—
called "laborers, not otherwise specified —

must have been engaged in farming in 1850 and 1860.

some who
Previous

researchers recognized this for the postbellum years, but not
for the antebellum period, apparently because the presence of

large numbers of slaves in farming masked the problem at the
national level. When one looks at just the free states, where
slavery could not distort the picture, it is evident that some

of these laborers must have been employed in farming (Weiss,
1987c)

My allocation of some of these workers to farming raises
that sector's labor force by 625,000 workers, or approximately

15 percent, in 1850; and by 584,000, or 10 percent in 1860)-s

These are not trivial amounts, but seem clearly called for.
Without such laborers, the ratio of the total farm workforce to
rural population in the free states was .15 in 1850 and .159 in
1860, substantially below the average of .192 in the years 1870

through 1910.17

With the addition of these workers, the 1850

and 1860 ratios are .194 and .189 respectively, very much in
9

line with the behavior of the ratio in the postbellum yearsJ8

The other factor of importance bearing on the difference
between the present estimates and those of Lebergott, David and

Easterlin is in the number of slaves engaged in farming.19 In

their figures, the number of slaves engaged in farming was
estimated by assuming that 95 percent of the slave population

aged 10 and over lived in rural areas, 87 to 90 percent of
which were engaged in f arming.2°

In the present estimates I

have placed a smaller share of the rural slaves in farming.21
I used the county level data on employment and population for
1840 to estimate the share of the rural slave population aged
10 and over engaged in farming, and applied this figure to the

1850 and 1860 rural population data to obtain an estimate of
slaves engaged in farming in those years.

Examination of the county level data indicated that the
census evidence seemed reliable in a large number of counties

in the South; 488 out of 633 in existence at the time. While
the census reported the slave and free populations separately,

it provided only one figure for employment in agriculture,
combining the free and slave workers. These data were used to
estimate a regression equation which would yield the implicit

participation rates for the free and slave components. These
data indicated that only 74 percent of the rural slaves aged 10

and over were engaged in farming.22 As can be readily seen,
this figure differs noticeably from that used by Lebergott and
David. The use of this figure to estimate the number of slaves
10

engaged in farming in 1850 and 1860 yields figures that are

smaller than Lebergott and David's by 280,000 in 1850, and
350,000 in 1860.

The farm slave figure implicit in the 1840

Census figure (1,158,000) is 203,000 less than Lebergott's
estimate.23

The revised figures accord more with what we know about

the other activities in which slaves were engaged.

In the

present series, 16 percent of the rural population aged 10 and

over, (or roughly 18 percent of the rural slave labor force)
was engaged in nonfarm work. This is in stark contrast to the

previous estimate that virtually no rural slaves worked at
nonfarm occupations, a figure much too low, given all the other

activities that took place on the plantation, and in rural
areas more generally.

This, after all, was a time when not

only mining, fishing, and forestry took place in rural areas,
but also much, and perhaps most, of manufacturing, especially

in the South.

The work of Ronald Lewis, John Stealey, and

others indicates clearly that many slaves were employed in
mining, manufacturing, salt extraction, and lumbering, and that
these activities took place to a large extent outside cities.24

Robert Starobin, the author of the most comprehensive study of

industrial slavery claims that "the typical industrial slave
lived in a rural, small-town, or plantation setting, where most
industry was located, not in a large city." (1970, p.11).

While systematic evidence on the nonfarm occupations of

slaves is harder to compile, the 16 percent figure is quite
11

consistent with what we do know. Sample data from plantation

and probate records indicate that 4.2 percent of the male
slaves and 17.6 percent of the female, or an average of 10.9
percent of the rural slaves were engaged as domestic servants
(Olson, 1983). Some of these may have worked part of the time
as field hands, but the nonfield occupation was their primary
one, and is likely the one that would have been reported to the

census taker.

Given the wide range of other tasks to which

slaves were set, the figure for domestic servants seems like a

reasonable lower—bound to the total number engaged in nonfarm
occupations.

If we take account of all the other occupations

that could be construed as nonfarm, an upper bound can be set
at 27 percent of plantation (rural) slaves.25

The 16 percent

figure derived from the county level data falls securely
between the 10.9 and 27 percent.26
Differences in 1840

The difference of 315,951 in the estimates for 1840 stems

from varying judgments about the inaccuracies of the census
count.

Both series accept that the census counts covered all

the relevant population groups, namely those aged 10 and over,

both free and slave.

The present series reflects a judgment

that the census did not count all the workers in those covered

groups, and raised the census count by 168,195 workers.

The

previous estimate of Lebergott rests on the idea that the
census undercounted in some locations, overcounted in others,

and on balance overcounted.

In consequence the census farm
12

labor force total was reduced by 147,756 workers (1966, pp.15255).

Easterlin, in his original work with the 1840 Census,

revised the count upward, although in some states in the
Northeast he reduced it.

In his subsequent work he accepted

Lebergott's farm totals, and thus implicitly the notion that

the census count was too high, but gave no reasons for his
change of mind.

In my assessment of the census, I judged each state
individually, and found that in some the count was too high,
but in most it was too low, especially in the South.

It is in

this region that the crucial difference arises, for Lebergott

argued 'that the Census enumeration must have counted all

slaves aged ten and over in rural areas as engaged in
agriculture" (1966, p.152).

He estimated the free farm work

force as a residual by subtracting the entire rural slave

population aged 10 and over from the census count of
agriculture.

Separately, he calculated the slave farm labor

force, as 90 percent of the rural slave population aged 10 and
over, and combined this smaller slave figure with the residual
estimate of the free farm workers to obtain his revised total.
The free workforce of 2,160,000, however, appears too low. The
ratio of that figure to the free rural population is only .168,

noticeably below the .208 ratio implied by his free farm
workforce estimate for 1820, and below that (.192) which
prevailed in the free states in the period 1870 to 1910.27
Moreover, the ratio for the free northern states, based on the
13

reported census statistics, was .21, while the free southern

ratio, derived by deducting the slave labor force from the
reported totals, is only .07.28

Differences in 1820
The difference of 181,000 between the present and previous

estimates for 1820 is a little harder to explain because I did

not make explicit, separate adjustments to the free farm or
slave workforces that can be compared to Lebergott's estimate.

However, for illustrative purposes we can look at the numbers
implicit in my revised farm totals for each of these population
components.

The larger difference lies in the number of slaves engaged

in farming, 127,000 fewer in the present series. The Census
did not separate free and slave workers, and I did not make an

explicit estimate of either, but by following the same
procedures used for 1840 to estimate a regression equation from

the cross-sectional data for a subset of counties in which the
census counts seemed reliable, I calculated an implied share of

79 percent of the rural slave population aged 10 and over
engaged in farming.

This means that 788,000 or 87 percent of

the rural slave workforce was in farming.

In contrast,

Lebergott allocated the entire rural slave work force to
As noted earlier, the lower

agriculture (915,000 slaves).

figure is much more consistent with other evidence about the
nonfarm activities in which rural slaves were engaged.

If we deduct these slave counts from the farm totals, we
14

obtain free residuals of 1,500,000 in the present series and
1,553,000 in the Lebergott series.

While there is a smaller

discrepancy between these two figures than showed up in the
slave comparison, the derivation of the free workforce reveals

some reasons behind the overall difference. We both increased
the total labor force by approximately the same amount in 1820;

688,000 in the present case, 644,000 in the previous series,

but Lebergott allocated a substantially larger number to
farming, 246,000 versus 400,000.29 His allocation was based on
the distribution of the workers among the subset of industries

reported in the Census, from which he calculated that 83
percent of the free males were employed in farming. Since part

of the deficiency in the total labor force was due to the
census's

failure to report employment in the service

industries, the share of the total revision going to
agriculture should be smaller than that found in the reported
figures.

Moreover, the inclusion of slave workers in the

reported figures gives an upward bias to the farm share3° In
the present figures, I have not made an explicit estimate of

the adjustment to the free farm workforce, but my total
correction to the Census agricultural figure of 246,000 is 36
percent of the revision to the entire labor force.31

An overall assessment of the two series can be
accomplished by comparing the labor force figures to changes in

the rural population. This is done in Tables 2 and 3. At the

national level, the two labor force series show similar
15

percentage changes relative to the rural population growth over

the decades of the 1840's and 1850's. Over the period 1820 to

1840, however, the behavior of the present estimates is far

more consistent with the percentage changes in rural
population. The present series also appears more reasonable if
compare shifts in the farm share of the labor force with shifts

in the rural share of the population (Table 3).

The rural

share of the population declined by 4 percentage points between

1820 and 1840, and 10 percentage points between 1840 and 1860.

The previous estimates show a rather large decline in the farm

share of 16 percentage points between 1820 and 1840, and a
decrease of 10 percentage points over the next 20 years.

In

the present estimates, the decline over the period 1820 to 1840

was 5 percentage points, followed by an 11 point decrease
between 1840 and 1860. The two series show comparable behavior

over the latter twenty years, but in the earlier period, the
previous estimates yield a change far out of line with that for
rural population.
Implications

One of the most obvious implications of the new figures is

that the levels of output per worker in farming in the late
antebellum period were lower than previously believed.
4)

(Table

This is true for the nation, as well as each region, with

the sole exception of New England in 1860. Among regions, the

output per worker figures have been lowered the most in the
South Atlantic and South Central regions.
16

The South Central

region is still one of the most productive, but its edge over
the North Central and Middle Atlantic has been reduced in 1840,
and eliminated in 1850 and 1860.

At the national level, the growth in output per worker is
similar in the two series. The southern regions show virtually
identical changes, in spite of the relatively large differences

in levels, while the Middle Atlantic and North Central regions

now show somewhat faster rates of productivity growth.

The

most striking disparity is in the growth of output per worker

in the New England region, where the new figures show a 12.7
percent increase over the entire 20 year period, in contrast to
virtually no growth in Easterlin's figures.

For the period before 1840 we can calculate output per
worker figures only at the national level because regional farm

output data are lacking.

According to Paul David's

estimates, farm labor productivity increased by 31 percent
between 1820 and 1840 (1967, Table 6).

The index of farm

output he used to derive the productivity estimate was
constructed independent of his labor force figures, so can be

used with the present series to obtain the result that farm
labor productivity increased by only 11 percent over the twenty

year period.32

These alterations in the pace of farm productivity change

extend to the behavior of per capita income. David's original
conjectural estimates showed a growth of per capita income of

approximately 2 percent per year between 1820 and 1840,
17

somewhat higher than the 1.6 percent rate that occurred over

the subsequent 20 years.

Using the present labor force

estimates, the conjectural growth between 1820 and 1840 was .9

percent per year.

The revised rate falls below that of the

following decades, and leaves open the possibility of a gradual

acceleration in the growth of per capita income during the
antebellum period.

The level of per capita product implicit in the revised
conjecture is $76 in 1820, which is 25 percent above David's
figure.33

This higher level passes Gallrnan's test of the

reasonableness

of

the implicit flow of non-perishable

consumption and investment spending (1971, Table 4).

After

subtracting Galiman's estimate of the flow of perishable
consumption, $43 in 1820, the residual of $33 seems quite

plausible in comparison to the
consumption that occurred in 1840.

$46

of non-perishable

By way of contrast, the

implicit non-perishable figure in David's estimate is only $18.

With the new figures the effect of the regional
redistribution of farming is not very important, even less so

than was found by Easterlin.34

The impact of regional

redistribution can be guaged by calculating hypothetical values

of the 1860 national average output per worker and comparing
them to the actual 1840 figure.

In one calculation we weight

the 1840 regional productivity figures by the 1860 shares of
the farm labor force, while in a second approach we multiply
the 1840 regional shares of the labor force by the 1860 values
18

of output per worker. The first measure reflects the impact of

the regional redistribution, and shows an increase of only $3

above the 1840 figure, while the second, which captures the
effect of intraregional productivity advance, is $27 higher.

The latter effect clearly dominates the overall change,
accounting for 90 percent of the improvement.35

We can speculate as well on the impact of interregional
movement in the period before 1840, by assuming that there had
been no changes in productivity within each region between 1820

and 1840, but that farming activity had relocated as it did.

The result is that regional redistribution alone would have
raised national output per worker by only $6, or a mere 3.3
percent.36

This slight positive effect of interregional

redistribution is nonetheless larger than the $3 change that

occurred over the period 1840 to 1860, just the reverse of
Easterlin's finding.37 While the effect of redistribution was

not important in either period, it appears to have been
relatively more important in the earlier one.

If farm labor

productivity increased by only 11 percent between 1820 and
1840, then the redistributive effect accounts for 30 percent of

that increase, making it three times as important as it was in
the subsequent 20 years.

One of the things that stands out in the present figures,

especially in comparison to the previous estimates is the
picture of agricultural change in New England.

The pace and

timing of the shift out of farming, and the relative changes in
19

farm productivity, have been altered.

According to the

previous estimates the region showed an absolute decline over

the period 1820 to 1840, then virtual stability over the
1840's, and a subsequent, but small, absolute decline in the
1850's. Now, it appears that the region shifted out of farming

a bit more slowly between 1820 and 1840, and more rapidly
thereafter. In the first period the farm labor force increased

by 22.6 percent, although the sector's share still declined
substantially from 65 percent to 54 percent. In the subsequent

decades the farm share declined even more noticeably, falling
to 39 percent in 1850 and 31 percent in 1860.

For the period 1840 to 1860, New England was still one of

the least productive farm areas, with an output per worker
figure well below that in all other regions, except the South
Atlantic. But the more rapid shift out of farming during these
decades,

is

reflected in a more favorable picture of

productivity change. According to the Easterlin data, the New

England states had the smallest advance in productivity over
the entire 20 years from 1840 to 1860. Now the region shows a

rate of productivity advance in excess of that in the South
Atlantic and nearly equal to that of the South Central states.

This pattern of change ties in well with more traditional

views of New England's agriculture. While the opening of the
Erie Canal had a serious impact on farming in the region, the

more devastating effect followed upon the completion and
extension of the railroad network (See Field, 1978 and Russell,

These

decisions, perhaps especially that to alter the mix of output

can be viewed as attempts to capture a part of the region's
burgeoning urban market for farm goods. Such efforts could not

fend off indefinitely the flood of products from western New

York, and the states of the Northwest territory, especially
after the improvements in rail connections, and after 1840,
those farmers' sons who wished to continue farming migrated
West, rather than carry on with the unpromising ventures in New

England. Of course, many left farming all together. (Bidwell,
1921, p.700).

CONCLUS IONS

This paper has set forth new estimates of the farm labor
force covering the period 1820 to 1860, for the United States
and the major geographic regions. These national and regional

figures are based on state estimates. The original intent of
21

the estimation was to produce state and regional series that
were consistent with the existing national series.

However,

examination of the individual state data produced revisions
which

yielded national figures noticeably different from the previous
estimates.

In particular, the new estimates lower the 1820

farm labor force by about 8 percent, while raising the figures
for 1840, 1850, and 1860 by 7 to 9 percent.

These differences in the sizes of the farm workforces are
due largely to three factors.

In all years the new estimates

incorporate a smaller number of slaves in farming, roughly 75
percent of the rural slave population of working age as opposed

to the previous estimate of nearly 90 percent.

In 1850 and

1860 this downward bias is more than offset by the addition to

farming of workers who had reported their occupation as
"laborer, not otherwise specified."

Previous estimates had

placed all these workers in nonfarm industries, but careful

examination of the state data, and the location of many of
these workers in rural areas, argues for the assignment of many

of them to farming. In 1820 and 1840 the new estimates differ
from the older ones because of varying judgments about how to
correct the census deficiencies. In 1840, I raised the census

count of farm workers by about 5 percent, while Lebergott

reduced it by about the same margin.

For 1820, we both

increased the census count of the total labor force by
approximately the same amount, but Lebergott allocated nearly
22

twice as many of these added workers to agriculture. Since the

original census count was low primarily because of the
exclusion of workers in the service industries, a large
allocation to farming seems inappropriate.

As a consequence of these changes, the farm work force
grew more rapidly than was previously believed, which implies
that farm productivity and per capita income grew more slowly.
The impact of the revisions varied by subperiod. For the later

decades, 1840 to 1860, the size of the sector is larger, but

there is little alteration in the pace of growth at the
national or regional level.

However, we now find a higher

level of farm productivity and of per capita income in 1820,
and a slower growth in these variables over the ensuing twenty
years.

This paper has not addressed the regional differences to
any great extent. While the original intent of the estimation
was to develop the state and regional figures, the alterations

to the national figures were so substantial as to warrant
immediate attention. It is clear, however, that our picture of

regional variation must change, the more so in some regions.
In particular, the pace and timing of the shift out of farming

in New England, and changes in farm productivity there vis-a-

vis other regions, have been altered substantially.

It now

appears that the region shifted out of farming more slowly
between 1820 and 1840, but quite rapidly thereafter.

The striking differences between the present and previous
23

series, and their implications for our understanding of the

path of American economic development, certainly raise some
questions. However, the revised series is more consistent with
changes in the rural population, and so seems more secure than

the older estimates. This in turn gives a measure of credence
to the altered picture of growth presented here. Clearly, both

the estimates and the substantive issues warrant further
examination.

FOOTNOTES

1.
In all this work I am proceeding on the assumption that the
census counts of population are accurate, or at least equally
reliable at the various census dates.
Several researchers have

concluded that the census undercounted population in the
particular years and localities they have studied.

Since my

labor force estimates are derived as the product of age-sex—state
specific participation rates times the population component, it
would be straightforward to adjust my labor force estimates to

conform to any revised population levels, should reliable
estimates of these undercounts be produced.

Coale and Zelnick (1963) have argued that the population
enumerations in the postbellum period (actually since 1855) have
been low, but so far, the evidence of underenumeration in the
antebellum censuses pertains to specific places, and it is not
known whether the entire census in any year, much less all years,
was subject to the same degree of error. (See Steckel, 1987, for a
summary of the case studies pertaining to the antebellum years.)
More troublesome, is the possibility that the undercount fell

more heavily on certain population groups which held a
disproportionate share of selected occupations, thus giving a
relatively larger undercount of the number of workers in those
occupations in the census figures (Sharpless and Shortridge,
1975).
2.

The total labor force is the sum of the workers in five

population components; free males aged 16 and over, free females
aged 16 and over, free males aged 10 to 15, free females aged 10
to 15, and slaves aged 10 and over. The estimate of the number of

workers in each group is the product of the population in the
group times the group-specific participation rate.

My labor force estimates are based on the concepts and
coverage used by the decennial censuses of the 19th century. They
are more precisely termed "gainful worker' counts, and are known

5. To a large extent these assessments are based on the behavior
of the labor force statistics relative to population. As noted
earlier, I am proceeding on the assumption that the census counts
of population are accurate, or at least equally reliable at the
various census dates.

In both 1850 and 1860 I adjusted the census counts from

their reported coverage of those aged 15 and over to the smaller

10.

My assessment of the 1840 Census indicated that the

reported labor force in the covered industries was low by about
300,000 workers, and that this undercount was largest in the

Moreover, I did correct the North Central figures for an error of

reasonable given the size and composition of the state's

population.

12. In his analysis of agricultural productivity change, Galiman

argued that the existing estimate of the farm labor force for
1850 was low, perhaps by as much as 12 percent, or 600,000
workers (1975, p.50). The present estimates are much closer to
the level that Gallman thinks would be consistent with our other

knowledge about the course of productivity change over the
nineteenth century.

13. This factor accounts for a difference of 31,000 in 1850 and
17,000 in 1860.
Lebergott estimated the number of free males
aged 10 to 15 in farming as 17 percent of the population (1966,
pp.152-53). I have assumed that all males aged 10 to 15 years in
the rural labor force were in farming.
For the nation, this
means that approximately 21 percent of the rural male population
aged 10 to 15 was in farming, and that the national percentage
declined over time with urbanization.
The two methods would
yield equal numbers when the urban share of the population was 20
percent, which occurred around 1860.
In that year, the two
estimates are quite close, being within 5 percent of each other.
Since my procedure relied on participation rates specific to
each state, the estimation of this group of farm workers has
differential effects across regions.
The number of such males
would be lower in New England, and higher in the South, in the
present series than is implicit in the previous estimates.
14. This estimate raised the present farm labor force figure by
61,495 in 1850. The Census of 1860 included free females aged 16
and over in the count of farm workers, and it appears that they
were also included in the Census count for 1840, thus an estimate
seems called for in 1850 in order to have consistent coverage
over time.
My estimate is based on sample data taken from the
manuscript schedules of the 1860 census. That evidence indicates
that 1.5 percent of the females aged 16 and over were engaged in

farming in the North Central region, and .7 percent in the

a figure covering only those aged 16 and over. The 15 year olds
removed by this adjustment were subsequently included in the

independent estimate of those workers aged 10 to 15.

In

addition, some individual state counts were corrected in each
year. (See Weiss, l986b) The net effect of these adjustments and
corrections lowered the original census figures by 38,000 in 1850
and raised them by 71,000 in 1860.
There is also a small unexplained discrepancy between the
present and previous estimates in each year, 21,000 in 1850 and
46,000 in 1860.

16. My method of allocating this group of unspecified laborers
rests on the idea that there was a strong relationship between
The
urban and nonf arm occupations, including nonfarm laborers.

Census of 1910 reported the number of unspecified laborers
according to their industry of employment. For earlier years, I
distributed the reported number of laborers between farm and
nonfarm industries according to the 1910 proportions adjusted for
changes in urbanization. (See Weiss, 1987c, for details.)
The adjustment varies by region, with the Northeastern farm

workforce being increased by 314,000 (24 percent), the North
Central by 155,000 (15 percent) and the South by 148,000 (5
percent) in 1850; and by 195,000 (15 percent), 202,000 (12
percent) and 158,000 (5 percent) respectively in 1860.

17. The ratio is fairly steady as well, .183 in 1870, .199 in
1880, .203 in 1890, .193 in 1900, and .182 in 1910.

postbellum years.

Implicitly there is a difference between my estimate of
slaves in farming in 1840 and Easterlin's original estimate.
19.

While we both relied primarily on the census data, I revised the
census figures for the South upward by more than he did; 148,000
versus 41,000. (Easterlin, 1960, p.127). In a subsequent article
Easterlin adopted Lebergott's national totals, so the comparison
discussed in the text pertain to those figures (Easterlin, 1975,
p.110).

20. Lebergott's explanation indicated that he intended to
allocate only 87 percent of the rural adult. slaves to farming,
but in the execution the 90 percent figure was used. In 1860, he
28

used a different figure altogether, namely the participation
rates for free males aged 15 and over.

21. A minor difference is that I have estimated directly the
urban and rural slave populations aged 10 and over.

population aged 10 and over was .337, quite close to the values of
.322 and .333 which prevailed in the rural South in 1850 and 1860.
It is also close to the ratio which prevailed in the free northern
states in 1840, .306 using the original census data, .312 with the
revised figures.

23. A similar procedure was followed in 1820, and a regression
equation estimated for that year as well. That equation gave the
result that the share of the rural slaves aged 10 and over in
farming was 77 percent, slightly above the 1840 figure, but still

well below the 90 percent figure underlying the previous
estimates.
I have used the 1840 coefficient to estimate the farm
slaves in 1850 and 1860 because that date is closer in time to the

years in question, the sample size used in 1840 is much larger
than the 1820, 488 counties versus 274, and as noted above, the
estimated coefficient for the free population in 1840 was close to
the expected value and gives us some confidence in the estimated
value for the slave population.

and finally 2.1 of the males and 1.4 of the females were
classified as semi-skilled, which included many farm occupations,
but also mill workers, fishermen, and watchmen.

In an earlier work I estimated the number of slaves working

that evidence indicated that approximately 16 percent of the rural
slaves aged 10 and over worked at service tasks in the period 1840
to 1860.

The evidence from interviews with ex-slaves shows higher
percentages were engaged in household tasks (Crawford, 1980).

27. Lebergott judged the 1840 ratio in comparison to that for
1850 (.16), and found it reasonable. However, that ratio, as well
as the 1860 figure, is too low because he did not allocate any
laborers, not otherwise specified, to agriculture.

other hand, in his approach we must accept that they accurately
counted and classified farmers and farm laborers. The presence
of large numbers of laborers, not otherwise specified, and the

fact that farmers and farm laborers were reported as one
occupation in 1850 suggests they had their difficulties in
classifying those workers.

If females are excluded, the farm correction is 48 percent
of the total workforce revision.

32. The two labor force series imply similar percentage
increases in productivity over the subsequent twenty years; 21

estimates.

33. The per capita income figure derived using David's labor
force estimates is $61. Both his and the revised income figures
use the 1840 value of Gross Domestic Product per capita ($91)
derived from David's original work, and estimate the 1820 values
by multiplying that figure by the growth index number. The index
numbers were calculated using the conjectural growth equation

30

34. Easterlin found that productivity growth within regions
accounted for about two-thirds of the increase in output per
worker between 1840 and 1860, and regional redistribution,
explained the rest of the increase. He computed a hypothetical
1860 output per worker figure for the nation by using the actual
1860 productivity figures for each region, and assuming that the
distribution of the farm labor force was the same as had existed
in 1840. The difference between this hypothetical figure and the

is the interaction effect that occurs in these index number
calculations, and which is usually assumed to be distributed
across the factors in proportion to their importance in the
explained change.

36. Paul David estimated that the regional shift would have
increased average agricultural output per worker by 3.6 percent
between 1820 and 1840. This is roughly 12 percent of the total
improvement in farm labor productivity that occurred in the 20
years (1967, pp.l78—79).

37. Easterlin found that the effect in the period 1840 to 1860
was nearly as large as that for the entire 40 years before 1840,

and nearly twice as large as the increase from 1820 to 1840
(1975, Table 1 and p.97).

In both series, the numerator used in the calculation is
Easterlin's figures for agricultural income by region, so any
differences in the productivity ratio are due entirely to the
labor force estimates.
