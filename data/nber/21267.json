    "abstract": "\n\nCulture is a potent force in shaping individual and group behavior, yet it has received scant attention in the context of financial risk management and the recent financial crisis. I present a brief overview of the role of culture according to psychologists, sociologists, and economists, and then present a specific framework for analyzing culture in the context of financial practices and institutions in which three questions are answered: (1) What is culture?; (2) Does it matter?; and (3) Can it be changed? I illustrate the utility of this framework by applying it to five concrete situations\u2014Long Term Capital Management; AIG Financial Products; Lehman Brothers and Repo 105; Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale\u2019s rogue trader; and the SEC and the Madoff Ponzi scheme\u2014and conclude with a proposal to change culture via \u201cbehavioral risk management.\u201d\n\n",
