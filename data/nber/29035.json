    "abstract": "\n\nBusiness groups often contain banks or near banks that can protect group firms from economic shocks. A group bank subordinate to other group firms can become an \u201corgan bank\u201d that selflessly bails out distressed group firms and anticipates a government bailout. A group bank subordinating other group firms can extend loans to suppress their risk-taking to default risk, preserving risk-averse low-productivity zombie firms. Actual business groups can fall between these polar cases. Subordinated group banks magnify risk-taking; subordinating banks suppress risk-taking; yet both distortions promote business group firms\u2019 survival. Limiting intragroup income and risk shifting, severing banks from business groups, or dismantling business groups may mitigate both distortions; but also limits business groups\u2019 internal markets, thought important where external markets work poorly.\n\n",
