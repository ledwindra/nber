Housing Busts and Household Mobility: An Update
Fernando Ferreira, Joseph Gyourko, and Joseph Tracy
NBER Working Paper No. 17405
September 2011
JEL No. R21,R23
ABSTRACT
This paper provides updated estimates of the impact of three financial frictions – negative equity, mortgage
lock-in, and property tax lock-in – on household mobility. We add the 2009 wave of the American
Housing Survey (AHS) to our sample and also create an improved measure of permanent moves in
response to Schulhofer-Wohl’s (2011) critique of our earlier work (Ferreira, Gyourko and Tracy (2010)).
Our updated estimates corroborate our previous results: negative equity reduces household mobility
by 30 percent, and $1,000 of additional mortgage or property tax costs reduces household mobility
by 10%-16%. Schulhofer-Wohl’s finding of a slight positive correlation between mobility and negative
equity appears due to a large fraction of false positives, as his coding methodology has the propensity
to misclassify almost half of the additional moves it identifies relative to our measure of permanent
moves. This also makes his mobility measure dynamically inconsistent, as many transitions originally
classified as a move are reclassified as a non-move when additional AHS panels become available.
We conclude with directions for future research, including potential improvements to measures of
household mobility.

Introduction

A long literature in housing economics has noted that a rise in mortgage rates could
‘lock-in’ an owner to her current house, thereby slowing or preventing a permanent move to a
new residence if mortgage interest rates had risen sufficiently to make the new debt service
payment unaffordable (Quigley (1987, 2002)). Other financial frictions, such as the one arising
from California’s Proposition 13 property tax rules, would have similar effects on household
mobility (Ferreira (2010)). Negative equity, by which we mean the current value of the house is
less than the outstanding mortgage balance, also could reduce household mobility if the owner
does not have enough liquidity to pay off the full loan balance, which is required for a permanent
move and sale of the property if the borrower is to avoid the cost of a default (Stein (1995), Chan
(2001), and Engelhardt (2003)).
These three potential financial frictions are all associated with the sale of the house so
there is a transfer of economic ownership, not just a change of residence. Thus, the type of
household mobility that may be impacted by these financial frictions involves permanent moves
in which both physical location and economic ownership changes for the previous owner. The
housing literature on financial frictions does not have clear implications for temporary moves in
which the household leaves the house for a period of time – perhaps to rent out the house – and
returns at a later date. Overall mobility reflects both permanent and temporary moves. The
mobility measure of interest depends on the question being addressed. Given our underlying
research question, when we refer to mobility in this paper, we mean mobility arising from
permanent moves.
Interest in the relationship between the mobility of homeowners and financial frictions,
especially those associated with negative home equity, was piqued both for researchers and

1

policy makers by the recent extraordinary boom and bust in U.S. housing markets. Because the
studies cited above were dated or based on samples from specific geographic regions or
population subgroups, we used the American Housing Survey (AHS) panel from 1985-2007 to
provide new and more general estimates for the nation (Ferreira, Gyourko and Tracy (2010);
FGT (2010) hereafter) that include all three forms of financial frictions in the same econometric
specification. FGT’s (2010) three primary results were as follows: (a) owners with negative
equity were one-third less likely to move than otherwise observationally equivalent owners
without negative equity; (b) for every $1,000 in higher mortgage debt service costs, mobility was
about 12% lower; c) similar increases in property tax costs from Proposition 13 in California also
reduced mobility by about 12%.
This note updates our previous work in two important ways. It adds data from the most
recent 2009 AHS survey, providing the first evidence from the beginning of the bust in home
prices in many markets. Second, we address Schulhofer-Wohl’s (2011) criticism of our sample
selection procedures, which he claimed underreported mobility and were responsible for our
reported negative correlation of mobility with negative equity.
Schulhofer-Wohl (2011) is correct that we underreported overall mobility. However, that
was done by design in order to distinguish between permanent and temporary moves. This is
crucial for our research question, as the underlying theory from earlier work implies that it is
only with respect to permanent moves that these potential financial frictions should lead to lower
mobility. A temporary move reflects a situation in which an owner-occupied residence is
reported as vacant or rented for one or more surveys, with the original owner subsequently
returning to the residence. These can occur because of a homeowner really vacates her home
temporarily or because vacancy status is misreported in the AHS survey data. Economic

2

ownership does not change in this latter case so the costs associated with the frictions have not
yet been incurred. Nevertheless, Schulhofer-Wohl’s (2011) critique led us to develop an
improved measure that better exploits the panel structure of the AHS to distinguish between the
two types of moves. This raises our reported mobility rates substantially (by over 25%), but it
does not materially affect our findings from FGT (2010), as reported below in Section III.
In that analysis, we do not adopt Schulhofer-Wohl’s (2011) strategy of counting all
transitions from ownership to rental or vacancy status as permanent moves because it
dramatically overstates their number. His finding of a slight positive correlation between
homeowner mobility and negative equity is likely due largely to conflating temporary and
permanent moves.2 We show below that over the period from 1985 to 1999 in the AHS data,
more than 20% of his moves are temporary in nature, which makes his measure problematic for
use in research about lock-in effects. These temporary moves correspond to approximately 50%
of the additional moves that Schulhofer-Wohl (2011) tallied in excess of our new, preferred
mobility measure. There is still uncertainty about the economic ownership of the property for
the other 50% of additional moves.
Schulhofer-Wohl’s (2011) measure of mobility also can be dynamically inconsistent,
with moves in one period recoded at a later date as non-moves as additional waves of AHS data
are included in the estimation sample. These issues are especially worrisome if one is trying to
understand the impact of the recent housing bust on household mobility because the errors from
conflating temporary and permanent moves are concentrated near the end of the data, and the

2

Schulhofer-Wohl used FGT (2010) data and codes to generate his mobility measure, and compared his results with
our baseline measure of mobility. He then provided his underlying code, just as we did for him. Our discussion of
his mobility measure always applies to the first of four such variables from his 2011 paper.

3

AHS does not yet have enough post crisis surveys to allow researchers to distinguish between
these types of moves.3
This update highlights how noisy are the data from AHS surveys, but we know of no
superior source with which to investigate this issue. Given that it takes time to resolve
uncertainty about whether some transitions are permanent or temporary in nature, there is no
variable that perfectly reflects the mobility relevant to analysis of the impact of financial
frictions. That includes our improved measure reported in this paper. It still understates true
mobility rates to the extent any of the moves that we censor due to uncertainty about whether a
change in economic ownership of the property occurred actually reflect permanent moves.
Precisely where to draw the line on this measurement issue requires careful consideration of the
costs and benefits of overstating versus understating the amount of permanent moves. We
continue to advocate for a conservative coding strategy which is dynamically consistent over
time, but this clearly is not costless.
Beyond doing everything possible to reduce the noise in the data, future research should
address the issue of the extent to which these correlations represent a causal relationship. As we
noted in our previous work, the likelihood that labor markets deteriorate along with housing
markets raises the possibility that owners with negative equity are not moving in part because
there are no good job opportunities elsewhere for them. Distinguishing between these two
potential causes of reduced mobility requires expanding one’s theoretical and empirical horizons
to better control for labor market conditions, and that is the direction in which we urge future
research on this topic to turn.

3

The distinction between permanent and temporary moves will also be a data issue for researchers using household
panel data sets such as the Panel Survey on Income Dynamics (PSID). Exact property address information will be
required to reliably distinguish between these two types of moves.

II.

Additional Data and New Measures of Mobility

II.A. Changes in the data and summary statistics
There are four changes to the data used in this update of FGT (2010). The first is the
addition of the 2009 AHS sample, which became available after we had published our previous
article. The 2009 AHS data allow researchers to begin to examine the impact of the house price
declines between 2005 and 2007 on household mobility from 2007 to 2009. This is
straightforward, and we present and compare results with and without the new data. This does
not result in any meaningful changes in our findings.4
The second change involves the use of First American-Core Logic (FACL) repeat-sales
price indexes in lieu of the Federal Housing Finance Administration (FHFA) series when we
create instruments to address measurement error in the creation of negative equity variables.
Unlike the FHFA series which are based only on conforming loans, the FACL series include
arms-length purchases made with conforming and non-conforming loans, including subprime,
Alt-A and jumbo mortgages. We believe this provides a more complete picture of what was
going on in terms of local house prices especially in recent years, but this change also has no
material impact on the results.5
The third change involves additional cleaning of the panel structure of the AHS data. The
AHS survey was designed to be primarily used as a series of cross-sections rather than as a panel.
For this reason, a variable that we employ to define the panel structure – the purchase year of the
house -- was not dependent coded. By that, we mean that the interviewer does not have access to
the responses for this variable from prior surveys, so that there is no way to ensure consistent
4

We caution below that this does not necessarily signal that the estimated relationship between mobility and
negative equity during this housing market downturn will not change as additional AHS survey data becomes
available. See the discussion below for more on this.
5
The FACL used here includes the impact of distressed transactions. We have experimented with a series that does
not include them, and it does not change our results.

5

coding across surveys at the time of the interview. As a result, the purchase year can vary in the
data even for the same household. If left uncorrected, this spurious variation in the reported
purchase year will induce false household transitions. FGT (2010) developed several rules that
were used to identify and clean these false household transitions in the data. For this update, we
also include hard-coded edits to the purchase year based on an inspection of the data history for
each residence, including information on the household head’s demographic characteristics.
This additional cleaning of the panel structure significantly improves on our earlier rule-based
edits.6
The fourth and most important change involves the use of an improved measure of
mobility, which is the dependent variable in our analysis. This alteration was motivated by
Schulhofer-Wohl’s (2011) critique of our sample selection procedures. In FGT (2010), we
deliberately chose a conservative definition of what constituted a move for the reason noted
above—namely, that theory suggests financial frictions involving the likes of negative equity or
mortgage lock-in should impact mobility for permanent moves. To ensure we did not mistakenly
include temporary moves (or false transitions due to any remaining reporting error in the survey),
we restricted our sample to those observations where it was immediately clear either that the
same household resided in the given housing unit across consecutive surveys (in which case
there was not a move) or that a different household lived in and owned the unit that had been
owned by another household in the previous survey (in which case there was a permanent move
because both physical location and economic ownership had changed).
Summary statistics of our original mobility variable, here called MOVE, are reported in
the first row of Table 1. This measure is identical to the one used in FGT (2010). Focusing
6

In the current work, we also follow Schulhofer-Wohl (2011) in setting tenure to missing whenever tenure was
imputed by the AHS. There were 2,183 cases where the reported imputed tenure was reported as owner-occupied
and 458 cases reported as rental.

6

initially on the top panel which reports data for the 1985-2007 period covered in FGT (2010)
shows that 7.8% of the 61,801 housing transitions used in our regression analysis are moves
according to this definition.7 Those 61,801 transitions are only 82.7% of the total number of
observations potentially available to us.8 That is, we treat 17.3% of the potential transitions as
censored. In 2.4% of the cases, the move is censored due to the observation being the last in the
panel of data for a particular residence. The remaining cases involve transitions of the property
from ownership to rental or from ownership to vacancy where it is still possible that we may
observe the original owner return to the property.
In his first and preferred mobility measure, Schulhofer-Wohl (2011) effectively counted
all cases in which a unit that had been owned in a given survey and was now being rented or was
vacant in the subsequent survey as a move. Using the code Schulhofer-Wohl provided, we
created this variable in our data. It is labeled MOVE-SW in the second row of Table 1. Note the
much higher mobility given this definition—16.4% of transitions are moves, versus 7.8% given
FGT (2010)’s definition.9 A much lower fraction of the data is censored using the MOVE-SW

7

The reported mobility rate drops from 11.4% in our previous work to 7.8% in this new estimation sample. This
decline reflects the removal of false moves as a result of the additional data cleaning.
8
There are 74,774 observations on potential transitions between 1985 and 2007 for which we have complete data on
all of the control variables as well as instruments used in our regression specification reported below. The
estimation sample of 61,801 is nearly identical to our earlier estimation sample size of 61,803. This reflects the fact
that the additional observations added to the estimation sample due to cleaning of previously uncaught false
transitions in the panel structure nearly balance the number of observations lost due to deleting observations with
imputed tenure status.
9
As we will show later, the MOVE-SW measure would reflect even higher mobility if it literally did what
Schulhofer-Wohl states in his paper (2011, p. 5): “As I explain in the introduction, FGT drop from the sample all
cases where a house is owner-occupied in year t but is vacant or rented in year t+2. I make only one change to
FGT’s data: I code those cases as moves.” FGT (2010) does not actually censor all such cases. For example, if the
existing owner were to temporarily leave the unit vacant or rent it out and then come back to the unit in a subsequent
survey, the data set for our 2010 paper would not censor the initial observation in that sequence. Our code would
recognize that the initial observation in that sequence was not the last for the given household, and we only allow
moves for the last observation on the household. By using the code from our 2010 paper, Schulhofer-Wohl (2011)
effectively corrects for some temporary moves like this, so that not every case in which a ‘house is owner-occupied
in year t but is vacant or rented in year t+2’ is counted as a move in his data. We comment more on this below.

measure, reflecting only the 2.4% of cases noted earlier where the observation is the final one in
the data panel for a particular residence.

II.B. Two new measures of mobility that exploit the AHS panel structure
Because the conservative coding approach in FGT (2010) could result in dropping some
permanent moves in a non-random way that might affect our key estimates, we develop an
improved measure of mobility that uses the AHS panel structure to help mitigate this potential
problem. This new variable is labeled MOVE1 in Table 1. In creating it, for all cases where the
next survey indicates that the house is vacant or rented, we now look forward across all available
surveys to see if the house again becomes owner-occupied by another household, not just the
previous owner. If it does, we note the year in which the house was purchased. If the purchase
year is between the current survey year and the next survey, we code this as a permanent move.
An example is illustrated below. The top row reports the AHS survey year; the second
row indicates tenure status (owned or rented); and the third row reports the year the home was
purchased by its owner.
Survey year
Tenure status
Year purchased

2003
Own
1997

2005
Rent
NA

2007
Rent
NA

2009
Own
2004

In this case, the housing unit was owned as of 2003 by someone who purchased it in 1997. The
same housing unit is reported as rented in the next two surveys. Then, the 2009 survey reports
the unit as again being owned, with the owner having purchased the home in 2004. This tells us
there was a permanent move by our prior owner, with the house being sold to a new owner in
2004 and that owner presumably renting it out for a period of time. In our previous coding,
situations like this would have resulted in a censored value for our dependent variable in 2003,
8

with the observation being dropped from the analysis. Our new mobility measure MOVE1 will
code this as a move for the 2003 observation.
We also take advantage of a variable in the AHS that records the vacancy status of a unit
(“vacancy”) to help resolve some of the cases that are censored under the rules creating the
MOVE mobility indicator. For example, we code MOVE1 as indicating that a move and sale
took place if the vacancy variable indicates that the house has been “sold but not yet occupied”
(vacancy = 5). We code MOVE1 to indicate that the original owner has not moved if the unit is
listed as being held for occasional use, seasonal use, or usual residence elsewhere (vacancy = 611). Each of these instances suggests the presence of multiple homes for the household, so that
one should not interpret a transition as a permanent move and sale of the property. We also code
MOVE1 to indicate that the unit has not sold if the unit is listed as non-cash rent for one or more
surveys followed by owner-occupied status with the purchase year outside of the window
between survey years. Finally, we code MOVE1 to indicate that a move and sale has not taken
place if the unit is vacant for two consecutive surveys and listed as sold but not occupied in the
second survey (vacancy(t+2) = 5).
Table 1 shows that resolving previously censored cases in this manner results in 10.0% of
our regression sample transitions now being coded as permanent moves. MOVE1 mobility is
much higher than MOVE (by 28%), but it remains well below that for MOVE-SW. We will
discuss the differences across measures more fully just below, but before we do, we introduce
another mobility variable called MOVE2.
For MOVE2, we maintain the requirement that we are certain that the household has
permanently moved, but relax the restriction that we know that the house sold in the interval

9

between the relevant surveys. Naturally, this leads to an even higher fraction of transitions being
classified as permanent moves, as indicated in the following example.
Survey year
Tenure status
Year purchased
Move1
Move2

2003
Own
1997
Censored
Yes

2005
Rent
NA
NA
NA

2007
Rent
NA
NA
NA

2009
Own
2008

In this case, we cannot tell if the owner in 2003 both changed residence and sold the property
between 2003 and 2005. It is possible that a move and sale did take place and that the new
owner decided to rent out the property until 2008 when the property was re-sold. That new
owner then decides to live in the property and reports a purchase year of 2008 in the 2009 AHS.
On the other hand, it is also possible that the owner in 2003 decides to move and to rent out the
property, becoming an absentee landlord. The house is then sold in 2008. Since both situations
are consistent with the reported data, this would result in MOVE1 being censored and recorded
as missing. However, in MOVE2 we classify this as a move in 2003 because we know that the
original owner moved and did not return to the property. Thus, MOVE2 includes cases in which
we know there was a permanent move, but cannot resolve the timing of the sale by the original
owner. The last row of the top panel of Table 1 shows that the fraction of MOVE2 transitions is
ten percent higher than for MOVE1 (11.0% versus 10.0%). Still, this more expansive definition
does not generate anything close to the level of mobility indicated by MOVE-SW.
The bottom panel of Table 1 reports the analogous data for each mobility measure for the
full sample that includes the 2009 survey data. Note that mobility is lower for each variable,
which indicates that measured mobility declined between the 2007 and 2009 surveys. We
exploit this issue in more detail below.

10

II.C. Trade-offs across different measures of mobility
Our worry about Schulhofer-Wohl’s empirical strategy for the question that we are
addressing is that several of the housing transitions that he considers as moves are false positives
in the sense they are temporary moves or reflect coding error in the underlying survey. To gauge
how serious is the potential problem of conflating these types of moves, we evaluated the
likelihood of Type I and Type II coding errors on his mobility measure by coding them in ‘real
time’ in the AHS data. That is, we begin by reading in the cleaned panel and selecting
observations for 1985 and 1987. We then code MOVE-SW based on his code for 1985 using
data from both the 1985 and 1987 surveys. These values for MOVE-SW are saved and the
exercise is repeated using the 1987 and 1989 pair of surveys, the 1989-1991 pair, and so on, until
1997-1999. We stop in 1999 for this exercise to ensure that we have enough future surveys to
assess whether Schulhofer-Wohl’s moves turned out to be permanent or temporary. We call this
real-time version of the Schulhofer-Wohl mobility measure MOVE-SWR.
It is important to note that the coding of MOVE-SWR in this real-time analysis differs
from the coding of MOVE-SW used in the estimation sample. The example below illustrates
why.

Survey year
Tenure status
Year purchased

2003
Own
1997

2005
Rent
NA

2007
Own
1997

When the 2003 AHS data is added to the estimation sample, MOVE (and our two other mobility
measures), MOVE-SW and MOVE-SWR for 2003 will all be censored because at that time, this
is the last observation in the panel for the residence. When the 2005 AHS data is added, MOVE
for 2003 will remain censored and both MOVE-SW and MOVE-SWR for 2003 will be recoded
as a move. However, when the 2007 AHS data is merged into the sample, MOVE for 2003 (as
11

well as MOVE1 and MOVE2) will be recoded from censored to a non-move, while MOVE-SW
for 2003 will be recoded from a move to a non-move, and MOVE-SWR for 2003 will remain
coded as a move (since we do not allow the real-time measure to be recoded once it indicates that
a move has taken place). The reason for the recoding of MOVE and MOVE-SW is that in
constructing these mobility measures the data are sorted by residence, household (based on a
unique household identification number we create), and survey year. Using the sorted data, a
move is only considered for the last observation for that household. As a result, our coding
strategy for MOVE (as well as MOVE1 and MOVE2) only recodes censored observations as
either non-moves or moves, and never recodes non-censored mobility observations. In contrast,
the coding for MOVE-SW can be dynamically inconsistent over time, with moves recoded at a
later date as non-moves. By construction, MOVE-SWR maintains dynamic consistency by not
recoding a move as a non-move even when information becomes available indicating that the
original owner has returned.
The top panel of Table 2 reports cross-tabulations of our MOVE2 indicator, which takes
full advantage of the panel to differentiate between permanent and temporary transitions, and
MOVE-SWR.10 We use MOVE2 for this analysis since our focus here is whether a move is
permanent or not regardless of when the property was sold. The first column documents that
these two mobility variables agree that there were 70,707 cases in which there was no move.
There are no cases in which our MOVE2 measure considered some transition a move when
MOVE-SWR did not (that is, there is no evidence of Type II errors); nor is MOVE2 ever
censored or missing when MOVE-SWR indicates that no move took place.

10

Here we use all available transitions from the AHS for owner-occupied residents between 21 and 59 years of age
over the period from 1985 to 1999 and do not restrict the observations to those with non-missing values for all of the
regressors that we use in the final mobility estimation.

12

The second column is more interesting because both mobility measures have 8,550
moves, but MOVE-SWR has an additional 8,607 moves. Moreover, 41.3% (= 3,557 / 8,607) of
the additional moves in MOVE-SWR turn out to be temporary in nature in that they reflect Type
I errors. That is, using the full panel of surveys up to 2009, we observe the owner return to the
unit at some point in the future, or they reflect some other trait that leads us to conclude there has
not been a permanent move.11
Out of all false positives from MOVE-SWR, in two-thirds of the cases the Type I error
could be eliminated by looking at only one subsequent AHS survey, as shown in the bottom
panel of Table 2. To better understand this, presume that we are uncertain about whether a
transition in the 1985 data is permanent or temporary. That is, the data are clear that there was a
given owner-occupant in 1985, but a different occupant or reported vacancy in 1987. In 66% of
the cases, the 1989 survey fully resolves the uncertainty. In these “false positive” cases, that
means we see the same household living and owning the same housing unit in both 1985 and
1989. Another 17.4% of the false positives are resolved by the next available survey (i.e., after
six years have passed), so that over 83% of the cases are clarified by 1991 in this example. The
remaining cases are all clarified with future surveys, with some owners being absent for long
periods of time. However, the number of those cases is quite small.12
It is also important to note that for 5,050 transitions, MOVE2 is assigned a censored
value, while MOVE-SWR considers them moves. While none of these cases can be definitively

11

As noted above, the lack of dependent coding for this variable means that some of these cases could be due to
coding error by the AHS survey taker in the sense she does see or interview the original owner and mistakenly
concludes the unit is not occupied by the same person. The most important of the latter type of factor involves units
that are described as being vacant and held for occasional or seasonal use. This group comprises 14% of the 3,557
cases. There is a much smaller fraction (1.2%) for which there is non-cash rent and a subsequent sale outside the
relevant sample interval. There is an even smaller number (0.3%) that are vacant across two consecutive surveys,
with the second survey listing the housing unit as sold, but not yet occupied.
12
Subsequent to a temporary move, the mean (median) duration by the owner in the residence is 6.1 (5.0) years. In
38 percent of the cases, the post-temporary move duration is censored by the end of the data in 2009.

13

identified as permanent moves with the currently available data, some of them undoubtedly are
and will be revealed and coded as such over time as additional survey data becomes available. In
practice, this means MOVE2 still does not include all true permanent moves. This highlights
that there is no perfect measure of such mobility as long as the data do not allow for the
immediate recognition of whether an economic change in ownership has occurred.

Results

III.A. Estimation Methodology
As discussed in FGT (2010), given the likely measurement error in our measures of the
three financial frictions, we want to be able to instrument for this measurement error to reduce
the attenuation bias. While our alternative measures for these three frictions are also subject to
measurement error, if the sources of these errors are uncorrelated, then we can use them as
instruments. To accommodate our data structure, we use a recursive mixed-process model that
expands upon the classic mobility specifications introduced by Hanushek and Quigley (1979)
and Venti and Wise (1984) which also served as the foundation for our earlier empirical work.
The following four equation system describes our mobility outcome and our three instrumental
variables.

We estimate this system using Roodman’s “cmp” program in STATA. A description of
the program, its implementation and applications is given in Roodman (2009). For robustness,
we also present results for a single-equation probit (used in FGT (2010)) and a standard linear
probability model.13

13

Schulhofer-Wohl (2011) correctly noted that our negative equity indicator was a dichotomous dummy and thus
did not have the requisite properties for the IV Probit estimation procedure as carried out in FGT (2010).
Consequently, our main results of this update are based on the IV Probit marginal effects from the joint estimation
of the four equation system outlined just above. For comparison, we also report estimates from a single equation IV
Probit (used in our previous paper) as well as an IV linear probability version of the model, with those results being
reported in the second and third columns of Table 4 below. Schulholfer-Wohl (2011) does not instrument for the

III.B. Negative Equity

In this section, we first present updated results on the relationship between mobility and
negative equity using new data from the 2009 AHS and for the five different mobility variables
described above. For the rest of our discussion, we code MOVE-SWR for the full sample period
from 1985 to 2007 or to 2009. Table 3 begins by providing summary statistics on the
distribution of self-reported negative equity by whether or not there was a move. Table 4 then
reports the results of re-estimating the core mobility specification from FGT (2010), using the
five mobility measures described above as the dependent variable.
The top panel of Table 4 reports marginal effects from that specification estimated with
the cleaned and edited AHS data from 1985 to 2007. Results for the expanded 1985-2009 AHS
data are reported in the bottom panel.
Focusing first on the multi-equation probit marginal effects in column 1 indicates a
statistically significant negative relationship between the presence of negative equity and
mobility for our original MOVE indicator as well as for our improved MOVE1 indicator. For
our earlier sample period from 1985 to 2007, our preferred MOVE1 indicator implies that
negative equity is associated with a two-year mobility rate that is 3 percentage points lower
(ceteris paribus). This is 30 percent of the baseline mobility rate of 10%, which is a similar to
the relative impact than reported in FGT (2010). The MOVE variable used in our earlier paper
generates a slightly larger impact, but it is not statistically or economically different from that for
MOVE1. The more expansive definition of permanent mobility reflected in MOVE2 yields a
slightly lower marginal effect of 2.8 percentage points, or about one-fourth of the baseline

measurement error. As FGT (2010) showed, there never is any significant correlation between any financial friction
and permanent moves unless attenuation bias is dealt with in some fashion.

16

mobility rate. It is different from zero at a ten percent confidence level for the 1985 to 2007
sample, and we can never reject the null that the effects are the same across all three of these
measures. Comparing results across columns in the top panel indicates that implied marginal
effects from the multi-equation Probit specification are consistently lower than for the single
equation Probit and the linear probability specifications, although the pattern of findings is quite
consistent. In addition, the standard errors are such that we cannot conclude that the levels of the
implied effects differ by estimation strategy.
The first column of the second panel adds in the data from the 2009 survey. We find
modestly lower marginal effects here as compared to the 1985 to 2007 results, and negative
equity no longer is associated with statistically significantly lower mobility for the MOVE2
variable. However, these marginal effects are not significantly different from those from the
earlier sample period, so there is no evidence yet that the most recent housing bust has materially
changed the relationship between negative equity and owner mobility. That said, one cannot and
should not conclude that the relationship will not change over this cycle as more data becomes
available, as cautioned in the original FGT (2010). The previous section implies that it takes 4 to
6 years for the vast majority of the censored housing transitions to be resolved. Hence, it will be
much later this decade before we can more confidently know how negative equity affected
permanent mobility in this latest downturn.
Note that the coefficient on the MOVE-SW indicator as constructed by Schulhofer-Wohl
(2011) suggests a positive correlation between negative equity and mobility. In neither sample
period is this statistically different from zero, but the point estimates are positive, not negative.
The misclassification of so many temporary moves as permanent ones is likely to be critical here.
Recall that theory does not suggest a negative correlation between temporary moves and

17

negative equity. Hence, it should not be surprising to find a weak and imprecise correlation
when more than one-fifth of the coded moves may not involve a permanent move and sale of the
home.14
This intuition that the driving factor behind the difference in our negative equity results
and those reported by Schulhofer-Wohl (2011) is the conflation of temporary and permanent
moves is corroborated by comparing the different estimates associated with MOVE-SW and
MOVE-SWR. Recall that the distinction between these two measures is that MOVE-SWR retains
moves as identified by Schulhofer-Wohl that are known ex post to be temporary, whereas
MOVE-SW allows these temporary moves to be recoded as non-moves. Retaining these
temporary moves increases the measured mobility rate from 16.1% for MOVE-SW to 17.8% for
MOVE-SWR. The estimates in Table 4 indicate that adding these additional temporary moves
raises in each case the estimated positive impact of negative equity on mobility.
Of course, the underlying sample used in generating these estimates is the result of
censoring all cases in which we cannot tell whether both physical location and economic
ownership changed. That is roughly half of the excess moves in MOVE-SWR relative to
MOVE2 based on our real time analysis of the 1985-1999 period. Practically speaking, most of
the censored cases in our full data set are from recent waves of the AHS, and Table 2’s results
suggest that the vast majority will be resolved within four to six years. However, it seems likely
that at least some of the cases in which the previous owner is coded as no longer living in the

14

We also estimated all models with the original FHFA price series used to help determine negative equity.
Focusing on the system IV Probit results, MOVE-SW remains positive but still statistically insignificant. MOVE
continues to be positive and statistically significant. The marginal effects for MOVE1 and MOVE2 decline by
around 25% for the 1985-2007 sample, and by around 40% for the 1985-2009 sample and are no longer statistically
significant. This drop in the magnitude of the marginal effect likely reflects that inability of the FHFA house price
indices to accurately track the declining house prices due to its narrow focus on houses financed with conforming
mortgages.

18

unit over multiple surveys, but for which there still is no clear evidence of a sale, actually are
permanent moves.
This raises the question of whether we could improve on our permanent mobility measure
MOVE2 to count as moves situations where it seems likely (but not certain) that a permanent
move has taken place. Intuition might suggest that the longer the ownership gap observed where
the residence is reported as rental or vacant, the more likely that the previous owner will not
return. To check on this possibility, we looked at ownership gaps of different lengths and
computed the fractions of cases that the move turned out to be temporary conditional on having
the information to make this determination. For situations where the residence has been rented
or vacant for at least three surveys, the transition turned out to be temporary in 59% of the cases
where we could determine the final outcome. If we lengthen the ownership gap to four or more
surveys the percentage of temporary moves actually increases to 62%. This pattern continues for
ownership gaps of five or more and of six or move surveys. Thus, conditional on those cases
where we can resolve the nature of the transition, the simple intuition that the longer the current
ownership gap the more likely the move will turn out to be permanent is not supported in the
data. For this reason, we do not think that you can improve on MOVE2 by recoding censored
transitions as moves given an ownership gap of some specified length. However, it still is useful
to understand that the potential fragility of our results (and, possibly, those who came before us)
arises from the fact that it is difficult to properly measure mobility in a number of cases.

III.B. Fixed Rate Mortgage and Property Tax Lock-Ins

Updated results on the impact of two additional financial frictions on household mobility
are presented in Table 5. The first friction pertains to homeowners with a fixed-rate mortgage

19

(FRM). In a rising interest rate environment, if a homeowner with a FRM moves, the monthly
cost of an identically sized mortgage can be higher. The second friction pertains to homeowners
in California whose property tax increases have been limited over time due to Proposition 13. If
the homeowner moves to a similarly valued property, then property taxes would be set to the
fully assessed value of the house. In both cases, we examine the marginal effect of an additional
$1,000 annual cost on the likelihood that the household moves. We provide estimates for
specifications containing our two improved mobility indicators for the expanded sample period
where we use the FACL overall house prices to update home values. The data confirm our
earlier findings that both frictions give rise to reduced household mobility – from 10% to 16%
lower per $1,000 using our preferred mobility measure MOVE1. In none of the specifications do
the data reject that the mobility friction is the same whether it is being generated by rising rates
for a fixed rate borrower or higher property taxes for California homeowners.
We suspect that this interest rate-related lock-in effect will become increasingly
important as monetary policy is normalized in the future. To illustrate, consider the hypothetical
case of a 250 basis point increase in the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage interest rate as a
result of the normalization of monetary policy. For homeowners in 2009 with a FRM, this
results in a mean (median) annual payment difference of $2,300 ($1,710). Using the probit
marginal effects for MOVE1, this implies a mean (median) reduction in the 2-year mobility rate
of 3.7 (2.7) percentage points. If we redo the calculation using the estimates for MOVE2, we get
a reduction in the 2-year mobility rate of 5.3 (3.9) percentage points. This suggests that as

20

negative equity (hopefully) diminishes in importance over the coming years, it well may be
offset by an increasing fixed-rate mortgage friction.15

III.C. Housing Frictions and Labor Markets

Finally, there has been increased interest in the degree to which any mobility frictions
from the housing market may generate labor market frictions. While we do not have space in
this note to discuss in detail the recent literature on this question, the AHS data are useful in
examining the types of moves that are likely to be impacted by housing market frictions. The
AHS asks recent movers (moved within the last 2 years) the primary reason for the move and,

until 1995, the distance of the move. A high percentage of moves – 73 percent – are local, while
only 13 percent of moves cross a state border. Table 6 provides more detail in its tabulation of
the primary reason for moves, both overall and broken down by distance of the move. Most
moves are for quality-of-life, personal/family and financial reasons, and do not appear to be
primarily job-related. This is especially the case for local moves. In contrast, longer distance
moves, particularly those that cross a state border tend to be job-related. One potential
implication of these data is that financial frictions to household mobility are more likely to
reduce local moves such as trade-up purchases that need not have any significant spillover
effects for labor markets. This view is consistent with recent work by Donovan and Schnure
(2011) using American Community Survey data as well as by Aaronson and Davis (2011) using
Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) data.16

15

This is particularly true for borrowers who received a below market mortgage rate through a private modification
or a HAMP modification (conditional on the borrower not re-defaulting on the modified mortgage). If these low rate
mortgages were assumable, then there would be no associated mobility friction.
16
Household panel data sets such as SIPP data have the advantage that they can follow a household across different
residences. A challenge, though, is identifying permanent from temporary moves since this requires access to
specific address information.

21

IV.

Summary and Implications for Future Research

Including the most recent AHS survey for 2009, which reflects the initial data from the
recent housing bust, does not materially change previously reported estimates of how negative
equity and other financial frictions are correlated with homeowner mobility. Homeowners with
negative equity remain about one-third less likely to move than otherwise observationally
equivalent owners. However, the uncertainty surrounding changes in economic ownership
involving various transitions concentrated in the last few surveys suggests we cannot really know
for sure how the recent housing bust impacted permanent mobility until a few years into the
future when the data will reveal the true nature of those transitions.
A critique of our sample selection procedures which claimed to reverse this result appears
largely due to the incorrect classification of many transitions as moves that are likely to be
temporary and not permanent, or simply reflect coding error in the individual surveys. Whether
negative equity can be positively associated with temporary moves is a question that we did not
attempt to answer in our earlier work. That said, our improved measure still does not reflect
mobility perfectly because of our conservative policy of censoring transitions that cannot be
definitively defined as permanent in nature. Hopefully, others can develop better data sources or
improved ways to reduce the noise in the AHS panels.
For the future, we think it as or more important for scholars to tackle the question of
whether this correlation is causal in nature. That will require new theoretical and empirical
strategies to better control for labor market conditions. As long as labor and housing markets
move together (and there is sound reason both conceptually and empirically to believe they do),
the correlation documented here could be driven predominantly by there being a lack of good job

22

opportunities to which people would want to move. Until we address this issue, we will not
know the true social cost of highly leveraged home purchases that are more likely to lead to
negative equity situations.

The percentage moved is computed conditional on being in our final regression sample, which requires
no missing data for all regressors pertaining to household and housing unit characteristics. Percent moved
is the ratio of moves to the sum of moves and non-moves. Percent censored is the ratio of censored moves
to the sum of moves, non-moves and censored moves.
