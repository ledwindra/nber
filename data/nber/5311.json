    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper examines the hypothesis that the superior return to so-called value stocks is the result of expectational errors made by investors.  We study stock price reactions around earnings announcements for value and glamour stocks over a 5 year period after portfolio formation.  The announcement returns suggest that a significant portion of the return difference between value and glamour stocks is attributable to earnings surprises that are systematically more positive for value stocks.  The evidence is inconsistent with a risk-based explanation for the return differential.\n\n",
