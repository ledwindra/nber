    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper argues that hysteresis helps explain the long-run behavior of unemployment.  The natural rate of unemployment is influenced by the path of actual unemployment, and hence by shifts in aggregate demand.  I review past evidence for hysteresis effects and present new evidence for 20 developed countries. A central finding is that large increases in the natural rate are associated with disinflations, and large decreases with run-ups in inflation.  These facts are consistent with hysteresis theories and inconsistent with theories in which the natural rate is independent of aggregate demand.\n\n",
