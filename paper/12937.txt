The Valuation Channel of External Adjustment
Fabio Ghironi, Jaewoo Lee, and Alessandro Rebucci
NBER Working Paper No. 12937
February 2007
JEL No. F32,F41,G11,G15
ABSTRACT
Ongoing international financial integration has greatly increased foreign asset holdings across countries,
enhancing the scope for a "valuation channel" of external adjustment (i.e., the changes in a country's
net foreign asset position due to exchange rate and asset price changes). We examine this channel
of adjustment in a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with international equity trading
in incomplete asset markets. We show that the risk-sharing properties of international equity trading
are tied to the distribution of income between labor income and profits when equities are defined as
claims to firm profits in a production economy. For a given level of international financial integration
(measured by the size of gross foreign asset positions), the quantitative importance of the valuation
channel of external adjustment depends on features of the international transmission mechanism such
as the size of financial frictions, substitutability across goods, and the persistence of shocks. Finally,
moving from less to more international financial integration, risk sharing through asset markets increases,
and valuation changes are larger, but their relative importance in net foreign asset dynamics is smaller.

Introduction

The cumulative total of the U.S. current account deficits between 1990 and 2004 would have been
suﬃcient to increase net foreign liabilities to 33 percent of GDP. Yet, U.S. net foreign liabilities
increased to only about 23 percent of GDP over the same period (Figure 1). The diﬀerence is due
to valuation eﬀects, namely, the eﬀects of asset price and exchange rate movements on the stock
of gross assets and liabilities of the United States and the rest of the world. The experience of
the United States shows that external adjustment — i.e., changes in a country’s net foreign asset
position — can take place not only through changes in quantity and price of goods and services, but
also through changes in asset prices, as argued by Gourinchas and Rey (2005), Obstfeld (2004),
and Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2006).
This paper explores the valuation channel of external adjustment in a two-country dynamic
stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model with international equity trading. Specifically, we
study the determinants of the valuation channel and its relative importance in external adjustment,
and we illustrate its working. In the process, we explore the risk sharing implications of international
trade in equity.
We introduce two-way international equity trading in an otherwise standard two-country,
DSGE model with monopolistic competition and incomplete asset markets. To focus on the consumption and equity holding behavior of households, we consider a very simple production structure. Output is produced using only labor, subject to country-wide productivity shocks, and the
labor supply is inelastic. However, product diﬀerentiation across countries ensures that the consumption value of a country’s output depends on its relative price, which is endogenous to the
conditions of the economy. Monopolistic competition, based on product diﬀerentiation within
countries, generates non-zero profits and firm values, which are essential for the asset dynamics we
focus on.
Markets are incomplete across countries. Specifically, we assume that households can hold
non-contingent bonds and shares in firms, but only the latter are traded internationally. Thus,
unlike most of the literature, we focus on equity rather than bond trading as the key mechanism
for international consumption smoothing and risk sharing. Equity trades are subject to convex
financial intermediation costs. As in models with bond trading, these costs ensure uniqueness of
the deterministic steady state and stationary responses to temporary shocks.1 The structure of costs
enables us to determine endogenously the international distribution of wealth and the composition
of country equity holdings in and outside the steady state. This is a convenient feature of our
model that we exploit in calibration exercises.
1
As Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2003) point out, absent any stationarity-inducing device, once the model is loglinearized, the unconditional variances of endogenous variables are infinite, even if exogenous shocks are bounded.

1

Several qualitative results are unaﬀected if the costs are removed. Importantly, even in the
absence of financial frictions, decentralized international trade in shares does not yield perfect
consumption risk sharing when the economy starts from a steady-state equity allocation that diﬀers
from the social planner’s optimum. The reason is that international sharing is limited to the profit
fraction of income, while labor cannot move across countries in response to shocks. So the extent of
risk sharing in our model is crucially aﬀected by the distribution of income between profits and labor
income, which, in turn, is determined by the substitutability across individual product varieties in
consumer preferences. A world social planner would select the equity allocation — conditional on
income distribution — that spans all uncertainty and achieves perfect risk sharing with constant
equity holdings, as in Heathcote and Perri (2004) and references therein. But this equity allocation
is only one of infinitely many possible steady-state market allocations in the absence of financial
fees, and it has the empirically unappealing consequence that valuation changes become uniquely
responsible for changes in net foreign assets.2
Our main results on the role of the valuation channel of adjustment are as follows. In our
theoretical analysis, we confirm that net foreign asset dynamics comprise both movements in the
current account and valuation changes. The magnitude and significance of the valuation channel
depend on initial asset positions and features of the economy such as the magnitude of financial
frictions, substitutability across goods, and the persistence of shocks. The degree of substitutability
between home and foreign goods, however, has no eﬀect on the relative share of valuation change
and the current account in net foreign asset changes. Importantly, although changes in asset
valuation and the current account constitute two diﬀerent channels of shock transmission to net
foreign assets, the role of equity markets for consumption dynamics is fully summarized by changes
in asset quantities. According to our quantitative analysis, moving from less to more international
financial integration — i.e., moving from a steady state with home bias in equity to one with larger,
fully symmetric gross foreign asset positions — risk sharing through asset markets increases, and
valuation changes are larger, but their relative importance in net foreign asset dynamics is smaller.
Larger trade imbalances and a smaller contribution of the income balance are more important
determinants of net foreign asset dynamics with more integrated, but still incomplete, international
asset markets.
Our work is closely related to that of Kim (2002); Tille (2005); Blanchard, Giavazzi, and Sa
(2005); and Devereux and Saito (2005). All these contributions focus on the role of the exchange
rate in the valuation channel. We focus on the role of equity return diﬀerentials.3 Unlike Tille
(2005), we study also situations in which steady-state net foreign assets diﬀer from zero. Blanchard
2

We show that properly designed financial fees can decentralize the planner’s allocation as unique market outcome.
Tille (2005) documents that return diﬀerentials other than exchange rate movements are quantitatively at least
as important as the latter for valuation eﬀects, and they are more important in 8 of the last 15 years.

et al (2005) set up a traditional portfolio balance model with imperfect asset substitutability along
the lines of Kouri (1982) and discuss valuation eﬀects caused by exchange rate movements. We
develop a general equilibrium model which investigates the interaction between valuation driven
by equity prices, equities as claims to firm profits, and the transmission of shocks via the terms of
trade. Kim (2002) focuses on the consequences of revaluation of nominal asset prices, while changes
in nominal prices have no real eﬀect in our model. Devereux and Saito (2005) build a finance model
with no production.
Emphasis on macroeconomic dynamics also distinguishes our model from finance models of
international equity trading, such as Adler and Dumas (1983). Pavlova and Rigobon (2003) give
more prominence to macroeconomic dynamics, but without modeling firm decisions explicitly. Our
model diﬀers from earlier DSGE models of international real business cycles (RBCs) in that we
incorporate diﬀerentiated goods and monopolistic competition to have positive prices of shares in
firm profits. Moreover, many international RBC studies do not model equity trading by focusing
on complete Arrow-Debreu (or Arrow) asset markets that make all other assets redundant (for
instance, Backus, Kehoe, and Kydland, 1992).
Several other papers aim at explaining home bias in portfolios or international financial integration by allowing for international equity trading in standard international macroeconomic models
(Engel and Matsumoto, 2005; Heathcote and Perri, 2004; and Kollmann, 2005), whereas we focus
on the role of valuation in net foreign asset adjustment.4 For simplicity, we solve our model through
standard log-linearization, but another strand of literature studies alternative solution techniques
for incomplete markets models with multiple assets (Devereux and Sutherland, 2006, Evans and
Hnatkovska, 2006, and Tille and van Wincoop, 2006).5 While the focus of this paper and most
related literature is positive, Benigno (2006) provides a normative analysis of valuation eﬀects and
their consequences for optimal monetary policy, and Ghironi and Lee (2006) explore the role of
monetary policy in a sticky-price version of the model developed here.6
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 spells out the structure of the model.
Section 3 studies the valuation channel in two cases that can be solved analytically in log-linear
form. Section 4 explores the risk sharing implications of trade in equity. Section 5 illustrates the
working of the valuation channel by means of numerical examples and discusses the quantitative
performance of the model. Section 6 concludes. Technical details are in appendixes.

Kollmann (2005) studies changes in foreign equity holdings in an eﬀectively complete market, in which equities
are defined as claims to country-specific endowments of goods. He finds that changes in net holdings of foreign equity
are a key source of current account movements.
5
The impulse responses generated by solving our model via second-order approximation are not significantly
diﬀerent from those we report.

The Model

There are two countries, home and foreign, populated by infinitely lived, atomistic households.
World population equals the continuum [0, 1]. Home households are indexed by j ∈ [0, a); foreign

households are indexed by j ∗ ∈ [a, 1].

There is a continuum of monopolistically competitive firms on [0, 1], each producing a diﬀer-

entiated good. Home firms are indexed by z ∈ [0, a); foreign firms are indexed by z ∗ ∈ [a, 1].

2.1

Households

The representative home household j supplies one unit of labor inelastically in each period in a competitive home labor market for the nominal wage rate Wt . As customary, we denote consumption
with C and the consumer price index (CPI) with P . Money serves the sole role of unit of account,
since we assume that prices and wages are flexible. Therefore, we adopt a cashless specification
following Woodford (2003).
The preferences of the representative home household j are:

with 0 < β < 1 and σ > 0. The representative foreign household j ∗ maximizes a similar utility

market.

where ω > 0 is the elasticity of substitution between home and foreign goods. The consumption subbaskets CH and CF aggregate individual home and foreign goods, respectively, in a Dixit-Stiglitz
fashion with elasticity of substitution θ > 1:

We assume that the law of one price holds for each individual good: pt (z) = Et p∗t (z), where Et

is the nominal exchange rate (the domestic-currency price of a unit of foreign currency) and p∗t (z)
is the foreign currency price of good z.
Consumption preferences are identical across countries. This assumption and the law of one
price imply that consumption-based PPP holds: Pt = Et Pt∗ , where Pt∗ is the foreign CPI.

Agents in each country can hold domestic, non-contingent bonds denominated in units of the

domestic currency, and shares in domestic and foreign firms. Diﬀerent from most literature, we
assume that shares, and not bonds, are traded across countries for international risk sharing and
consumption smoothing purposes.
Omitting identifiers for households, firms, and countries, we use xt+1 to denote holdings of
shares in firms entering period t + 1, Vt to denote the nominal price of shares during period t, Dt
to denote nominal dividends, and Bt+1 to denote nominal bond holdings entering period t + 1.
Households pay quadratic financial transaction fees to domestic financial intermediaries when they
hold share positions that diﬀer from zero. As in models with international trading in uncontingent
bonds, these fees are a technical device to pin down equity holdings in the deterministic steady
state and ensure reversion to this position after temporary shocks.7 Table 1 summarizes the details
of our notation when agent and country identifiers are taken into account. The budget constraint

where it+1 is the nominal interest rate on holdings of bonds between t and t + 1, Ttj is a lump-sum
transfer from financial intermediaries, and the γ’s are positive parameters.
7

Cooley and Quadrini (1999) model limited participation in financial markets by assuming similar transaction
costs. Since aggregate bond holdings are zero in equilibrium in each country, financial fees on bond transactions are
omitted without loss of generality. Bodenstein (2006) argues that costs of adjusting asset holdings of the form we
employ (and other techniques explored in the literature) fail to pin down a unique steady state unless substitutability
between home and foreign goods in consumption is suﬃciently low. The specification of consumption baskets in our
model (with share parameters a and 1 − a) ensures that there is a unique steady state regardless of the value of ω.

5

The foreign household’s budget constraint is similar. We allow the scaling parameters of
financial fees (γ x , γ x∗ , γ ∗x , γ ∗x∗ ) to diﬀer across countries and across assets. This has implications
for the steady state of the model, which we exploit in analytical and numerical exercises below.
The financial transaction fees in the budget constraint are rebated to households in equilibrium.8

We omit transversality conditions. Similar Euler equations and transversality conditions hold for
the foreign household.
The equity choices of the representative household in our model depend on time-varying expected return diﬀerentials adjusted for financial intermediation costs. In the log-linear solution of
the model around a deterministic steady state, choices are not aﬀected by standard risk diversification motives captured by conditional second moments of asset returns and consumption. Thus, our
log-linearized setup does not help to explain the contribution of conditional risk diversification to
portfolio changes over time. Nevertheless, this does not imply that there is no role for risk premia
in the model. As illustrated by Lettau (2003), it remains possible in a log-linearized framework to
define average premia based on unconditional second moments. Although we do not pursue the
exercise here, it would be possible to address the risk diversification properties of our model — or
extensions to a wider menu of assets — from an ex ante perspective and compare them to the data
along the lines of Lettau’s exercise.
8

We think about the financial intermediaries in the model as local, perfectly competitive firms owned by home
households. There is no cross-border ownership of these firms.

6

2.2

Firms

The representative, monopolistically competitive, home firm z produces output with linear technology using labor as the only input:
YtSz = Zt Lzt ,

(9)

where Zt is the aggregate stochastic home productivity. The assumptions that labor is supplied
inelastically and is the only factor of production imply that output of each country’s sub-basket
of goods is exogenously determined by productivity. Importantly, however, each country’s GDP
in units of the world consumption basket is endogenous, as it depends on the relative price of the
country’s output in terms of consumption, which is determined by the pricing decisions of firms.
Home firm z faces demand for its output given by:

Relative Prices, GDP, and Income Distribution

We relegate aggregate equilibrium conditions for household behavior to an appendix and focus here
on the determination of some key variables in our model.
Define home aggregate per capita GDP in units of consumption as yt ≡ aRPt Ytz /a = RPt Zt

(where we used the equilibrium condition aLzt /a = Lzt = 1) and world aggregate per capita GDP as
ytW ≡ ayt + (1 − a) yt∗ = aRPt Zt + (1 − a) RPt∗ Zt∗ . Market clearing in aggregate per capita terms

requires aLzt /a = Lt = 1 = RPt−ω ytW /Zt , and similarly in the foreign economy. We thus have a
system of two equations in two unknowns that pins down home and foreign relative prices:
aRPt Zt + (1 − a) RPt∗ Zt∗

A positive productivity shock in the home economy causes the terms of trade to deteriorate as
increased supply of home goods lowers their relative price. Note that, when ω = 1, the terms
of trade move one-for-one with the productivity diﬀerential, as in Cole and Obstfeld (1991) and
Corsetti and Pesenti (2001).
Given the path of RPt implied by the system (13)-(14), the real wage that clears the labor
market is in turn determined by:

In a perfectly competitive environment in which θ → ∞, all GDP per capita would be distributed

to domestic labor in the form of wage income. In a monopolistically competitive environment with
constant markups, a share 1/θ of GDP is distributed as profits:
1
dt = yt − wt = yt .

(17)

The distribution of GDP between wages and profits will be an important determinant of the properties of our model as we discuss below.

2.4

Net Foreign Assets

Denote aggregate per capita home holdings of home (foreign) equity entering period t + 1 with
xt+1 (x∗t+1 ). Similarly, denote aggregate per capita foreign holdings of home (foreign) equity with
x∗t+1 (x∗∗t+1 ).9 Equilibrium aggregate per capita real home assets entering t + 1 are thus given by

vt xt+1 + vt∗ x∗t+1 , where vt ≡ Vt /Pt and vt∗ = Vt∗ /Pt∗ . Home aggregate per capita net foreign assets

entering t + 1 (nfat+1 ) are obtained by netting out the values of home holdings of home shares

(vt xt+1 ) and foreign holdings of home shares (adjusted for the population ratio, [(1 − a) /a] vt x∗t+1 ).
Thus,

1−a
vt x∗t+1 .
a
Foreign net foreign assets satisfy the market clearing condition:
nfat+1 ≡ vt∗ x∗t+1 −

a (nfat ) + (1 − a) nfa∗t = 0.

Details on the computation of these shares are in an appendix.

Steady-State Net Foreign Assets and Equity Returns

We present the details of the solution for the steady state of the model in appendix. Here, we
report the main results on steady-state net foreign assets, and equity returns. We denote steadystate levels of variables by dropping the time subscript.
Steady-state home net foreign assets are:

Home net foreign assets are lower the higher the intermediation cost faced by home agents in the
market for foreign equity (γ x∗ ), and the lower the intermediation cost faced by foreign agents in
the market for home equity (γ ∗x ). The net foreign asset position is zero if γ x∗ = γ ∗x , with gross
positions of equal value but opposite sign, proportional to the cost facing a household when buying
equity abroad. If β 6= 1, the net foreign asset position depends on all financial fee scale parameters,

reflecting the relative convenience of the two equities for home and foreign households in the two
markets.

Even if γ x∗ = γ ∗x , the equity return diﬀerential may be diﬀerent from zero. To be zero, it requires
equal intermediation costs across home and foreign equity within each country, with potentially
diﬀerent costs across countries for the same equity (γ x = γ x∗ and γ ∗x = γ ∗x∗ ), or equal costs across
countries for the same equity, with potentially diﬀerent costs across home and foreign equity within
each country (if γ x = γ ∗x and γ x∗ = γ ∗x∗ ).10
10

It is possible to verify that the model would feature a unique steady state even if household discount factors (β’s)
were diﬀerent across countries. Financial fees would prevent the outcome in which the most patient country owns all
the world equity from arising. Details are available on request.

Valuation Changes and the Transmission of Shocks

In this section we provide a decomposition of changes in net foreign assets into valuation changes
and the current account, with valuation changes and the current account further decomposed into
their components.11 We then analyze the determinants of valuation changes and the transmission
of relative productivity shocks in two special cases of our model that can be solved analytically in
log-linear form.

3.1

Valuation Changes and the Current Account

Assume for simplicity that the home and foreign economies have equal size (a = 1/2) and the
steady state of the model is such that v = v∗ and x∗ = x∗ . (Throughout, we assume that structural

parameters are such that the symmetry properties we appeal to are satisfied.) Log-linearizing (18)
and denoting percent deviations from steady-state levels with a hat yields:

(21)

dat+1 ≡ dnf at+1 / (vx), reflecting the fact that nfa = 0 when vx∗ = v ∗ x∗ . The change in

The first square bracket on the right-hand side of (22) is the valuation change on the existing
stock of net foreign assets due to changes in real equity prices. Changes in real equity values, in
turn, can be decomposed into changes in their nominal determinants (nominal equity prices,

price level, and the exchange rate). Specifically, v̂t = V̂t − P̂t and v̂t = V̂t − P̂t = V̂t − P̂t − Et .

This decomposition allows us to highlight a diﬀerence between our model with equity trading and
the more familiar framework with international trade in bonds. In our economy, the nominal
components of real equity prices have no independent eﬀect on real equity values (and thus net

foreign assets) because all prices involved are fully flexible. Furthermore, changes in real equity
prices are the only source of valuation eﬀects, since the real exchange rate is constant owing to PPP.
In an economy with bond trading, the nominal interest rate between t − 1 and t is predetermined

relative to the price level at t, resulting in a valuation eﬀect of nominal price movements on
outstanding bond positions via unexpected movements of ex post real interest rates under fully
flexible goods prices (Tille, 2005, and Benigno, 2006).
11

As measured in the balance of payments, the current account does not include capital gains on investments, while
the international investment position incorporates them. This component of investment income, however, enters the
textbook definition of total asset return.

10

The second square bracket in (22) is the change in net foreign assets due to purchases and sales
of assets and liabilities, i.e., portfolio rebalancing. This portfolio rebalancing term corresponds to
the current account balance that comprises the income and trade balance. To see this, assume
further that the steady state is such that x = x∗ = 1/2 and d = d∗ . Log-linearizing the equilibrium budget constraint in aggregate per capita terms and imposing the log-linear asset market
equilibrium condition x̂t+1 = −x̂∗t+1 , we obtain:

The first term on the right-hand side is the dividend income flow from net foreign assets accumulated
in the previous period, while the second term is the trade balance.12 Thus, the portfolio rebalancing
term in equation (22) is the current account balance.
As a corollary of the equations above, it is evident that valuation changes play a role in the
adjustment of net foreign assets in response to shocks in our model whenever the gross equity
positions of a country diﬀer from zero. That is, except in the case where gross (and thus net)
foreign asset positions are in zero balance for all countries.13

between (25) and the standard, log-linear law of motion for net foreign bond holdings in the more

familiar framework. In our model, the steady-state gross return on share holdings replaces the
steady-state gross interest rate.
12

The “2” that normalizes the trade balance originates from the fact that, with equal country size, asset market
equilibrium requires xt+1 + x∗t+1 = 1. In the symmetric steady state of this example, this implies x = x∗ = 1/2.
Division of both sides by vx in the log-linearization of the budget constraint results in the presence of the 2.
13
Note that net foreign asset dynamics can also be decomposed to total asset return and trade balance, where
the total return comprises valuation change and investment income. This decomposition is less dependent on the
accounting convention of the balance of payments statistics or corporate policies on dividend payouts. Our model
assumes that all profits are distributed as dividends, but this assumption does not apply to foreign direct investment,
for which profits are fully distributed and then reinvested by the accounting convention of the balance of payments
statistics. As noted by Obstfeld (2004), if companies choose to retain profits internally, this can reduce the magnitude
of current account variation in (23) and enhance the relative role of valuation changes in external adjustment.

Valuation and Transmission around a Symmetric Steady State

We now complete the solution of the log-linear model for the case of a fully symmetric steady state
in which everything is identical across two equal-sized countries (so that, in particular, x = x∗ =
x∗ = x∗∗ = 1/2).

t = − (1/ω) Ẑt and the definitions of home and foreign GDP’s in units of

reflects expected future share prices and dividends:

Any diﬀerential at time t is expected to persist at t + 1. As we show below, consistent with models
with bond trading only, the link between expected relative consumption growth and relative crossborder share holdings introduced when γ > 0 is crucial to deliver stationary responses to temporary
shocks.
Equations (27) and (30) allow us to solve for the determinants of relative share prices (and
thus the valuation eﬀect). Assuming that home and foreign productivities Ẑt and Ẑt∗ follow AR(1)
processes with common persistence φ ∈ [0, 1), we have:

The eﬀect of relative productivity shocks on relative share prices depends on the persistence of the
shock (φ), the elasticity of substitution between home and foreign goods (ω), the size of financial
frictions (γ), and the patience of households (β). We assume 0 ≤ γ < 1 and ω ≥ 1. Combining
these assumptions with the restrictions 0 < β < 1 and 0 ≤ φ < 1, we can conclude that:

∂η vD Z D

Relative productivity shocks induce larger changes in relative share valuation the more persistent
the shocks, the more substitutable home and foreign goods, the larger financial frictions, and
the more impatient households. Notice that purely temporary productivity shocks (φ = 0) have
no eﬀect on relative share valuation, because the diﬀerential in share prices is determined by its
expected future level and expected relative dividends, which are not aﬀected by the shock if this
has no persistence.
We note here that some of these results need to be qualified when we abandon the case of a
fully symmetric steady-state. Around a non-symmetric steady state, also purely temporary shocks
aﬀect relative share valuation, as will be shown in the next sub-section around an extremely nonsymmetric steady state. It is also important to keep in mind that the comparative statics above
on the eﬀect of changes in the size of financial fees (γ) are performed for unchanged steady state.
In other words, changes in γ are such that the symmetry of the steady state appealed to in loglinearization is unaﬀected. We can then compare shock transmission properties for diﬀerent size
of financial fees around an unchanged steady state. A diﬀerent, but important question is how
changes in the size of financial fees aﬀect dynamics around diﬀerent steady states when changes in
γ’s do not leave the steady state unaﬀected. Since this case becomes algebraically intractable, we
will study it by means of numerical exercises in the next section.
No arbitrage around the fully symmetric steady state implies that we can solve for the dynamics
of relative consumption and cross-border share holdings independently of the path of v̂tD , by solving
the system of equations (28) and (29). This implies that changes in equity valuation do not provide
an independent channel of consumption adjustment in response to shocks.14 Since optimal asset
pricing is the dual of the asset quantity choice in a forward-looking, general equilibrium model, and
equity prices are fully forward-looking, the role of asset markets for consumption dynamics is fully
summarized by the change in relative equity quantities held at home and abroad. Note that this
diﬀers from models with international trade in a risk-free real bond or currency-denominated bonds.
Changes in the risk-free real interest rate provide an additional channel of shock transmission to
consumption when initial holdings of the real bond are not zero across countries. When currencydenominated bonds are traded, unexpected changes in inflation generate unexpected changes in

Of course, the assumptions of our model imply that equity values have no eﬀect on GDP either.

real returns on existing bond holdings by inducing a diﬀerence between ex ante and ex post real
interest rates in the impact period of a shock. The diﬀerence in results between equity and bonds
stems from the fully forward-looking nature of equity prices versus the predetermined nature of ex
ante interest rates relative to shocks. The latter results in an independent role of bond valuation
in shock transmission.15

If γ = 0, this equation has solutions 1 and 1/β, and — discarding the explosive solution 1/β — we are
left with the familiar unit root for net cross-border share holdings as in models with bond trading
only and no stationarity inducing device. When γ > 0, there is still an explosive solution larger
than 1, and the unit root is “pulled” inside the unit circle, between 0 and 1, ensuring stationary
net foreign equity dynamics in response to temporary shocks.

trade in nominal bonds are central to results in Benigno (2006), Ghironi (2000), and Tille (2005).

financial frictions, γ — on the relative share of valuation versus the current account in net foreign
asset changes cannot be disentangled analytically in such simple fashion. Thus, we evaluate it
by means of numerical examples in Section 5. Next, we turn to shock transmission around a
non-symmetric steady state.

3.3

A Non-Symmetric Steady State: The Case of Full Cross-Shareholding

Consider now a steady state in which equities issued by each country are wholly owned by residents
of the other country (we call this full cross-shareholding). In terms of our notation: x = 0, x∗ = 1,

x∗∗ = 0, and x∗ = 1. This portfolio allocation arises endogenously by assuming that investing abroad
is costless in both the home and the foreign economy (with common friction of size γ for domestic

investment). Under this steady-state configuration, equity prices are v = v ∗ = β/ [θ (1 − β)], but

steady-state levels of wages, dividends, consumption, and relative prices are the same as in the
previous case.
We show in an appendix that the following system now determines the dynamics of relative
equity and the consumption diﬀerential:

where the diﬀerence from the symmetric case is due to the non-symmetric steady-state equity
holdings. Notice that the dynamics of share holdings now aﬀect relative share valuation. This has
the consequence of making relative valuation sensitive to zero-persistence productivity shocks via
their eﬀect on share holdings entering the following period.
We can obtain the following algebraic expression for the relative contribution of the current

where 0 is the time of the shock. The relative contribution of the valuation change in (44) is
higher the higher γ (the common financial intermediation cost on domestic shares). When financial
intermediation is more costly, valuation changes play a bigger role around the steady state, as
portfolio rebalancing entails larger costs.18 As in the symmetric case, the elasticity of substitution
between home and foreign goods, ω, does not aﬀect the relative contribution of valuation change
and current account, but it plays a critical role in determining the extent of adjustment via terms
of trade movements.
Starting from two diﬀerent steady states, this section shows that changes in equity values
provide a channel for net foreign asset adjustment but, in general equilibrium, do not provide an
independent channel of shock transmission to other variables. Therefore, valuation changes do not
constitute an independent channel of risk sharing in our model. The next section explores the risk
sharing implications of international trade in equity, the nature of asset market incompleteness in
our model, and how it aﬀects the role of valuation in net foreign asset adjustment.

4

Equity Trade and Risk Sharing

We begin this section by addressing the consequences of completely removing financial frictions
while holding the initial steady-state allocation of equity given at the two alternatives considered in
the previous section. This allows us to tie the risk sharing properties of equity trading — conditional
on a given steady-state allocation of equity — to the distribution of income between profits and
labor income. Next, we ask whether it is possible to achieve complete risk sharing via a proper
allocation of equity, conditional on income distribution. We show that such equity allocation exists,
and it is the allocation that would be chosen by a world social planner. But it generally diﬀers
from the decentralized market equilibrium, even if we show that a properly designed system of
18

A larger γ also causes η xD xD to decrease, but the net eﬀect on the relative share of valuation in net foreign
asset changes is positive. The relative contribution of valuation changes also increases with η xD xD , which is larger
when σ and/or θ become smaller. Lower values of these parameters lead to lower intertemporal substitution (more
consumption smoothing) and weaker competition (higher profits and equity prices).

17

financial fees can decentralize the first-best equity allocation. The diﬀerence between planning
optimum and market equilibrium is important for our analysis of the valuation channel, because
the planner’s equity allocation is constant across time and realizations of productivity, implying
that changes in equity values become the sole source of net foreign asset movements. The fact that
the decentralized market does not reproduce the first-best equilibrium is thus crucial for both price
and quantity changes to play an empirically plausible role in net foreign asset dynamics.

4.1

Trade in Risky Assets Revisited

The textbook intuition is that frictionless trade in two equities in an environment with only two
shocks — such as the one we are exploring — should reproduce the full insurance allocation of
complete asset markets. We ask here whether our model delivers the complete markets equilibrium
if there are no financial fees (and ω 6= 1) owing to the ability to trade equity at no cost in the
presence of productivity shocks only.

Without financial fees, the decentralized economy features a continuum of possible deterministic steady-state allocations of equity. This is a well known indeterminacy consequence of the
absence of a link between equity holdings and consumption growth in the Euler equations for optimal asset holdings.19 The steady state around which the model is log-linearized is only one of
infinitely many possible, chosen as a matter of convenience. We consider the two steady states that
were examined in the previous section.
4.1.1

Risk Sharing and Transmission around a Symmetric Steady State

Focus first on the case of a fully symmetric steady state of Section 3.2 and assume that γ = 0.
The elasticity of net foreign equity holdings entering period t + 1 to their past level (η xD xD ) is now
equal to 1, and the solution of the model takes the form:
D
D
x̂D
t+1 = x̂t + η xD Z D Ẑt ,

(45)

D
ĈtD = η C D xD x̂D
t + η C D Z D Ẑt .

(46)

For the solution to replicate complete markets, it must be ĈtD = 0. In other words, given the initial
condition x̂D
t = 0 at the time of a shock, it must be η C D Z D = η xD Z D = 0. The conjecture (45)-(46)
must now be substituted in the system:20

Therefore, the solution does not coincide with the full insurance outcome in which ĈtD = 0. Relative
productivity shocks case a consumption diﬀerential on impact, and the consumption diﬀerential
persists as a consequence of the unit root in net cross-border share holdings.21
This result highlights an important property of our model with equity trading. It is well known
that if the world economy consists of two countries consuming the same good, with country-specific
stochastic endowments of the good, CRRA preferences, and the ability to trade equity in the form
of shares in the endowments of the good, frictionless trade in these equities will lead to the complete
markets equilibrium. (For instance, see the discussion of this case in Obstfeld and Rogoﬀ’s, 1996,
textbook.) The same mechanism carries through to the case of two goods and a CES aggregator.
But the crucial diﬀerence is that our model does not allow trade in equity claims on endowments.
Our equity provides claims to profits, with the rest of a country’s income going to wages. To put
it diﬀerently, even with symmetric equity holdings, only part of GDP gets to be shared between
home and foreign residents. The wage portion is kept wholly by the residents of each country. As
a result, even without financial fees (and thus frictionless trade in two equities in a world with
only two shocks), equity trading starting from the symmetric steady-state allocation does not yield
complete risk sharing.
This reasoning is confirmed by the results above. For equity trading to result in full insurance
around the fully symmetric steady state, all of a country’s GDP should be distributed as profit,
leaving nothing for wages. The share of dividends in GDP is 1/θ, implying that all of GDP goes to
shareholders in the limiting case in which θ → 1 (the maximum possible degree of monopoly power).
As one can see from the expressions above, η C D Z D → 0 in this case, and so does η xD Z D . There

is full risk sharing under the initial, symmetric equity allocation, and (given the initial condition
D
D
x̂D
t = 0 at the time of a shock) the equilibrium is such that Ĉt = x̂t+1 = 0 in all periods.

Under this interpretation, we can conclude that a proper definition of equity in a production
economy (claims to profit rather than whole output) is suﬃcient to disturb completeness of the
market in the “conventional” case. The deviation from full consumption risk sharing around the
symmetric steady state is smaller the higher the degree of monopoly power along the two dimensions that are commonly explored in international macroeconomics: the higher monopoly power
of individual producers within a country (the closer θ to 1) and the higher monopoly power of a
21

It is easy to verify that one obtains the same solution for the case γ = 0 even if the conjecture for x̂D
t+1 is written
without imposing the restriction η xD xD = 1. In this case, applying the method of undetermined coeﬃcients simply
yields η xD xD = 1 along with the elasticities above.

country over its sub-basket of goods (the closer ω to 1). This result points to a diﬀerence between
economies with bond trading only and our model with equity trading. In the economy with bond
trading, ω = 1 is the only scenario in which incomplete markets reproduce the full consumption
insurance of complete markets. Once we allow for international trade in shares issued by firms
with monopoly power, full consumption insurance across countries arises also with ω 6= 1 if firms’

monopoly power is extreme and long-run equity positions are fully symmetric.

It is important to remark at this point that the risk sharing implications of extreme firmlevel monopoly power in our model are conditional on the assumption of a symmetric steady state
in which each country owns fifty percent of the other country’s equity. As we show below, a
diﬀerent distribution of income between wages and profits, associated with less-than-extreme firmlevel monopoly power, is required for equity trade to deliver full consumption insurance with ω 6= 1
when the steady state asset position is diﬀerent.

As for responses to productivity shocks, the elasticities without financial fees imply that the
qualitative direction of responses starting from the symmetric steady state is the same as with γ > 0
explored in Section 3.2. Responses when γ = 0 feature a permanent change in net cross-border share
holdings and consumption diﬀerential, but quantitative diﬀerences depend on parameter values.22
Finally, we examine the share of valuation in net foreign asset adjustment when there are no
financial fees. It is possible to verify that:
V ALShare0 =

φ
,
1 − θ (1 − φ)

1
V ALSharet≥1 = ,
θ

with CASharet = 1 − V ALSharet and t = 0 denoting the time of a shock. Absent financial fees,

the unit root in net cross-border share holdings implies that the share of valuation in external
adjustment is constant in all periods after the initial one, and is determined by the share of income

distributed to profits. If θ → 1, the share of valuation in net foreign asset changes tends to 1 in all

periods, consistent with the fact that there is full risk sharing and no change in net cross-border
share holdings.
22

It is impossible to pin down the response of holdings of individual equities when γ = 0, but this does not limit
our ability to solve for all variables of interest, including the paths of net cross-border share holdings, net foreign
assets, and the current account, starting from the symmetric initial position.

As before, the equilibrium does not mimic complete markets, and the intuition is the same — sharing
is limited only to a portion of GDP. However, assuming ω 6= 1, it is no longer the case that θ = 1

(and thus complete distribution of GDP to profits) is required for full consumption insurance to

arise. This now happens when θ = 2, i.e., with a share of dividends in GDP equal to 1/2. With full
cross-border shareholding, complete consumption insurance arises when half of GDP is allocated to
profits, and the remainder goes to wages. The wage income portion is now necessary to compensate
for the eﬀect of full initial cross-border equity ownership on income sharing. Recalling the result
above for the case of a symmetric steady-state allocation of equity, we have thus established the
general result that, once equities are defined as claims to firm profits in a production economy, the
risk sharing properties of international equity trading conditional on a market-determined initial
allocation of equity are tied to the distribution of income between profits and wages determined
by substitutability across individual product varieties in consumer preferences.23 In addition, the
distribution of income that ensures perfect risk sharing implies that the share of valuation in net
foreign asset changes is equal to 1.

4.2

The Planner’s Optimum and the Incompleteness of Decentralized Markets

We now turn to the question whether there exists an allocation of equity that delivers full risk
sharing conditional on income distribution and the consequences of decentralized markets. The
planning optimum for the world economy in our model is the allocation that delivers full risk
sharing, with a zero consumption diﬀerential in all periods for all realizations of productivity. As
we showed above, the assumptions of inelastic labor supply and labor market clearing imply that
firm-level monopoly power induces no distortion in the path of output, and thus aggregate world
consumption. Therefore, a world social planner who maximizes a weighted average of home and
foreign households’ welfare in our model would choose the allocation that equates home and foreign
consumption to world consumption in all periods. The question then is: Is there an allocation
23

See Cass and Pavlova (2004) for additional findings on the fragility of the welfare properties of the Lucas Trees
model. Ghironi and Lee (2006) explore the normative implications of this result and its consequences for optimal
monetary policy in a sticky-price version of the model.

21

of equity that achieves such goal? The answer is yes: There exists a (constant) allocation of
share holdings such that the consumption diﬀerential is zero at all points in time regardless of the
realizations of Zt and Zt∗ .
To verify this, use the equilibrium budget constraints for home and foreign, respectively:
vt xt+1 + vt∗ x∗t+1 + Ct = (vt + dt ) xt + (vt∗ + d∗t ) x∗t + wt ,

(47)

vt x∗t+1 + vt∗ x∗∗t+1 + Ct∗ = (vt + dt ) x∗t + (vt∗ + d∗t ) x∗∗t + w∗t .

(48)

Subtracting (48) from (47), using equity market equilibrium and the proportionality of dividends
and wage incomes to GDP, and rearranging yields:

Straightforward substitutions show that xt+1 = xt = xP = a − (1 − a) (θ − 1) and x∗t+1 =

x∗t = xP ∗ = (1 − a) θ imply CtD = 0 for every possible realization of yt and yt∗ (i.e., for every

possible realization of Zt and Zt∗ in our model).24 This is the allocation of share holdings that
ensures perfect risk sharing (spanning the two shocks, for all possible realizations) conditional on
the distribution of income between labor income and profits (the parameter θ). And this allocation
would be chosen by a social planner maximizing aggregate world welfare (hence the superscript P ).
In the planning optimum, constant equity holdings are adjusted to reflect income distribution
in order to deliver perfect risk sharing: The smaller the share of income distributed as profit (the
higher θ), the smaller the share of home equity that home households should hold, and the larger
the share of foreign equity. Given θ > 1, xP > 0 if and only if θ < 1 + a/ (1 − a). If a = 1/2

(symmetric country size), the planner’s share allocation implies going short in domestic equity
whenever θ > 2 (i.e., whenever less than half of income is distributed as profit). The planner’s
allocation always requires holding a positive amount of foreign equity (θ/2 if a = 1/2).
As anticipated above, constant equity holdings in the first-best equilibrium imply that changes
in asset values would be solely responsible for changes in net foreign assets. There would be no
need for current account movements.
To compare our results with those of the literature (specifically, Heathcote and Perri, 2004), we
note several properties of our model. First, the equity allocation that ensures perfect risk sharing
for all realizations of income is feasible also when financial fees are present (because it is obtained
by using only the equilibrium budget constraints). Second, with financial fees, the planner’s equity
24

∗P
Equity market equilibrium then implies xP
∗ = aθ and x∗ = 1 − aθ.

22

allocation is generally diﬀerent from the market allocation, except in the special case discussed
below in which fees are designed appropriately to decentralize the first-best equilibrium. In all
other cases, arbitrarily small, strictly positive financial fees ensure that the market equilibrium
diﬀers from the planner’s equilibrium, resulting in imperfect risk sharing. Finally, without financial
fees, the planner’s equity allocation is one of infinitely many possible deterministic steady-state
market allocations. It is a measure zero set in the continuum of possible steady-state market
equilibria. Hence, there is no presumption that the decentralized, steady-state market outcome
should coincide with the planning optimum. Whenever it does not, risk sharing is incomplete, as
we showed in the previous subsection.
Herein lie similarity to and diﬀerence from the literature on risk sharing via equity trade. As
in this literature, it is possible in our model with incomplete markets to span uncertainty with
only trade in equity conditional on the distribution of income, i.e., to have an equilibrium in which
market incompleteness does not “bite.” This is the equilibrium that a world social planner would
choose. Even abstracting from the evidence against perfect consumption risk sharing (or risk
sharing in the form of perfect correlation between consumption diﬀerentials and the real exchange
rate in models without PPP), the planning optimum has the empirically implausible property that
all changes in net foreign assets are entirely driven by valuation. When we remove financial fees and
tie risk sharing to income distribution, we assume that the steady-state share allocation is one of
the infinitely many possible steady-state market equilibria that diﬀer from the planner’s allocation.
Conditional on one such initial equilibrium for the decentralized equity market, the distribution of
income must satisfy certain conditions for perfect risk sharing to arise.

4.3

Decentralizing the First Best

Is it possible to design a system of taxes and transfers that decentralizes the first-best equity
allocation? The answer is yes, and it relies on the observation made above that the planner’s
optimum is feasible in an economy with financial fees. Given this, it is possible to design a system
of taxes and transfers that decentralizes the eﬃcient equilibrium. One can intuitively see that
quadratic fees and their lump-sum rebates can operate as a system of distortionary taxes and
lump-sum transfers in achieving this purpose. Suppose that the fee-scaling parameters are such
that γ x = γ x∗ = γ ∗x = γ ∗x∗ = γ and quadratic fees are centered around the planner’s allocation
(xP ≡ a − (1 − a) (θ − 1), x∗P ≡ (1 − a) θ, xP∗ ≡ aθ, and x∗P
∗ ≡ 1 − aθ) instead of zero holdings.
We show in appendix that this modification yields x = xP , x∗ = x∗P , x∗ = xP∗ , x∗∗ = x∗P
∗ as

unique deterministic steady state for the decentralized economy. Additionally, once the model with

the modified fees is log-linearized around this steady state, equity holdings remain constant at the
planner’s allocation and risk sharing is perfect in response to productivity shocks.
23

Thus, the eﬃcient equity allocation can be decentralized by designing the proper system of
financial taxes and transfers: The fees are the distortionary taxes that modify household incentives
appropriately in the Euler equations; the fee rebates are the lump-sum transfers that “balance the
budget.” Properly designed financial fees are welfare improving, as they implement perfect risk
sharing in the decentralized market economy.25
A question naturally arises on our modeling choice of centering fees around zero holdings
rather than the planning optimum. The motivation is implicit in statements above: The planning
optimum implies a degree of risk sharing that is contradicted by empirical evidence. It implies that
only valuation matters for net foreign asset movements, clearly at odds with evidence. Quadratic
fees centered around zero are then a convenient device to determine a unique steady state among
those in which market incompleteness “bites” — letting it be determined by the size of financial
frictions rather than the centering of the fee function — and avoid unappealing consequences for
second moment computation in the quantitative exercises to which we turn below.

The Valuation Channel at Work

In this section, we illustrate the working of the valuation channel of external adjustment and the role
of financial frictions (i.e., the γ’s) for the share of net foreign asset changes due to valuation eﬀects
by means of numerical examples. Before proceeding, we describe briefly the model parametrization
and discuss its performance relative to U.S. data in Section 5.1. We do so under two diﬀerent
assumptions on the degree of international financial integration, represented by the diﬀerent size
of the gross foreign asset positions in 1990 — the beginning of the most recent and rapid period
of international integration — and the last year for which we have data, 2004 (Figure 2). In the
first scenario, which we call “home bias in equity,” we set parameters so that steady-state gross
foreign assets and liabilities are about 40 percent of annual GDP, approximately as in the 1990
data, while net foreign assets are zero. In the second scenario, which we call “international financial
integration,” steady-state gross foreign assets and liabilities are about 100 percent of annual GDP,
approximately as in the 2004 data. Under this scenario, we allow for the possibility of negative
U.S. steady-state net foreign assets at about 25 percent of annual GDP. Then, in Section 5.2, we
compare the relative importance of alternative sources of net foreign asset changes and channels of
risk sharing in the model in the home bias and integration scenarios. Consistent with Section 3,
this comparison assumes zero steady-state net foreign assets in both cases.
25

One may wonder if it is possible to decentralize the eﬃcient allocation by properly choosing the scaling parameters
of fees centered around zero equity holdings. The answer is no. Details are available on request.

5.1

Parameter Values and Model Performance

Most parameter choices are standard, and steady-state productivity levels are normalized to 1 for
simplicity. As in Section 3, we assume that countries have equal size (a = 1/2). We interpret
periods as quarters, and we set relative risk aversion to the standard value of 2 (σ = 0.5) and the
rate of time preference so that the annual real interest rate is approximately 4 percent in steady
state (β = 0.99).
The elasticity of substitution among individual product varieties within each economy, θ,
determines the constant degree of market power and the profit share of income in our model. We
set θ = 6 to imply a 20 percent markup of prices over marginal cost, as in Rotemberg and Woodford
(1992).
The elasticity of substitution between the home and foreign baskets of goods determines the
extent of risk sharing through terms of trade changes. Estimates of this elasticity range from values
close to 1 in the macro literature to values as high as 12 in the micro, trade literature. We set
ω = 2. Higher values deliver more realistic correlations between home and foreign consumption
and home and foreign output than those reported below, but they would be less conventional.
Lower values, closer to structural estimates based on richer macro models, imply unrealistic terms
of trade dynamics and risk sharing properties.26 Note, however, that this parameter does not aﬀect
the share of valuation changes in net foreign asset changes at any time horizon. So we can safely
condition on any specific value for our purposes.
The size of financial intermediation costs determines the degree of international integration in
equity markets. (As we assumed in Section 3, bonds are not traded internationally.) In the home
bias scenario, the assumption is that intermediation costs for home (foreign) agents on foreign
(home) shares are larger than costs on home (foreign) shares. Specifically, to match the 1990 data,
we set γ x = γ ∗x∗ = 0.01 and γ x∗ = γ ∗x = 0.03. In the integration scenario with zero net foreign
assets, the assumption is that intermediation costs for home (foreign) agents on foreign (home)
shares are the same as the costs on home (foreign) shares. Specifically, to match the 2004 data,
we set γ ∗x∗ = γ x = γ x∗ = γ ∗x = 0.01. Finally, in the integration scenario with negative net foreign
assets, the assumption is that the cost for foreign agents on home shares is lower than the cost on
foreign shares (i.e., γ ∗x∗ = 0.01 and γ ∗x = 0.006), while the cost for home agents on foreign shares
is higher than the cost on home shares (i.e., γ x = 0.006 and γ x∗ = 0.01). Thus, interpreting home
as the U.S. economy, U.S. shares are cheaper for both U.S. and foreign agents. As a result, the
steady-state price of U.S. equity shares is higher than the price of foreign equity shares, while the
distribution of equity holdings remains symmetric as in the integration case with zero net foreign
26

assets. This assumption induces a negative net foreign asset position of about 25 percent of annual
GDP.27 Table 2 summarizes the steady-state portfolio shares and returns implied by our parameter
choices.
Table 3 reports second moments of the U.S. (home) data and the unconditional moments
generated by our model. The latter are computed with DYNARE under the assumption that the
exogenous (log) productivities in the two countries follow a bivariate AR(1) process with no crossborder spillovers, identical autoregressive parameters equal to 0.9, and uncorrelated innovations
with 1 percent quarterly variance.28 Three features of changes in U.S. net foreign asset data
stand out. First, this measure of external balance is much more volatile than the trade balance
or the current account balance. Second, while the trade balance and the current account are
countercyclical, the change in net foreign assets is essentially a-cyclical. Third, the change in net
foreign assets is slightly less persistent than the trade balance and current account.29 From Table 3,
we can also see that U.S. equity prices are highly volatile, positively correlated with foreign equity
prices, procyclical, and quite persistent.
With financial integration and steady-state net foreign assets that diﬀer from zero, our model
matches qualitatively — albeit not perfectly — the volatility, comovement with GDP, and persistence
of changes in U.S. net foreign assets. The model can generate changes in net foreign assets that are
more volatile, much less correlated with output, and less persistent than the trade balance and the
current account. The model, however, underpredicts equity price volatility and overpredicts equity
price comovement across countries. As a result, the matching of the moments of U.S. net foreign
asset changes is less satisfactory if the net foreign asset position is zero. Absence of investment
in physical capital in the model also generates a procyclical trade balance and current account in
contrast to the data.30
27

Note that the configuration of parameters that generates a given net foreign asset position is not unique.
Details on data sources and computation of data moments are in the appendix.
29
When calculated using Gourinchas and Rey’s (2005) quarterly data for 1973:1-2004:1, generously provided to
us by Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the persistence of net foreign asset changes is much lower (0.09), closer to the
persistence generated by our model with non-zero steady-state net foreign assets. The persistence of net foreign asset
changes is much smaller than that of the current account or trade balance also at annual frequency (Kollmann, 2005).
Gourinchas and Rey’s data produce estimates similar to those in Table 3 for the standard deviation of net foreign
asset changes (1.11, thus more volatile than current account and trade balance) and the correlation with output (0.02,
thus a-cyclical).
30
We experimented with alternative assumptions on productivity. In the financial integration scenario with zero
net foreign assets, using the bivariate productivity process in Baxter (1995) (with persistence 0.995, zero spillovers,
0.73 percent variance of innovations, and 0.19 percent covariance) matches relatively well the key moments of net
foreign asset changes and equity price volatility, but grossly overstates GDP and consumption volatility. Changing
the AR(1) matrix to that in Backus, Kehoe, and Kydland (1992) (with persistence 0.906 and positive spillovers 0.088)
also worsens the performance in terms of volatility of net foreign assets, because productivity spillovers cause equity
prices to become excessively correlated across countries. Removing the spillovers from this parametrization allows the
model to match GDP and consumption volatility, but results in too little volatility of both net foreign asset changes
and equity prices. Details are available on request.

5.2

Home Bias versus Integration and the Role of Valuation

To illustrate the role of valuation in net foreign asset dynamics and the relative importance of
alternative risk sharing channels under diﬀerent degrees of international financial integration, we
report selected impulse responses to a productivity shock in the home economy in Figure 3. As
mentioned above, we focus on scenarios in which steady-state net foreign assets are zero. We
consider a one-percent productivity shock in the home economy with persistence 0.9 at time t = 0.
Time is on the horizontal axis of each panel in the figure.
Panels A and B compare, in the cases of home bias in equity and international financial
integration, respectively, the responses of changes in net foreign assets (DNFAH) and their three
components: (i) the valuation change (VAH), the trade balance (TBH), and the income balance
(IBH), all in deviation from steady state, in percent of GDP (since steady-state levels of these
variables are zero). The valuation change is defined as the diﬀerence between the change in net
foreign assets and the current account. An increase in VAH thus contributes positively to the
¢
¡
D
in the log-linear setup of Section 3. Panels C and D
change in net foreign assets, as − v̂tD − v̂t−1
compare the responses of the terms of trade (TOT), world consumption (CW), and the deviation
of each country’s consumption from world consumption (CHCW for home and CFCW for foreign),
all in percent deviation from steady state. The deviation of each country’s consumption from world
consumption measures the overall degree of risk sharing generated by the model.
Under both scenarios, a favorable relative productivity shock to the home economy causes the
relative price of shares in home equity to increase, and home households to increase their holdings
of foreign equity relative to foreign holdings of home equity (i.e., to run a current account surplus)
to smooth consumption. The initial current account surplus, however, is smaller than the trade
balance surplus, as the income balance goes into deficit in response to the shock. Thus, initially,
both the relative increase in the value of home equity and the income balance contribute negatively
to the change in home net foreign assets, and adjustment through total equity returns (capital gains
and dividends) more than oﬀsets adjustment through the trade balance, determining a negative
change in net foreign assets. Given the time profile of the productivity shock, the valuation change
(a function of the productivity diﬀerential) is negative in all periods after the initial one, while
the income (trade) balance swings into surplus (deficit) more gradually. As a result, unlike in a
standard bond-only model, the change in net foreign assets is negative on impact, and relatively
less positive during the following transition path.
Note that, in our model, the wealth transfer through equity price changes does not take place
through violation of any arbitrage condition at the time of the shock, or thereafter. Valuation eﬀects
are an equilibrium phenomenon in our model and reflect the forward-looking nature of equity prices,
which jump on impact to keep equilibrium in the asset market and then return gradually to steady
27

state. Note also that the responses of world consumption (and thus income) and the terms of trade
are identical across scenarios. Therefore, the extent of risk sharing through terms of trade changes
is also the same. Further, we know from the theoretical analysis that the share of valuation changes
in net foreign asset changes is not aﬀected by the value of ω (although this does aﬀect the absolute
magnitude of the valuation change). So the only determinant of any change in the overall degree
of risk sharing across scenarios in the model, or in the relative importance of diﬀerent channels of
net foreign asset adjustment and risk sharing, is the diﬀerent degree of financial integration.
Importantly, as Figure 4 shows, the features of the transmission of a productivity shock that we
described thus far are robust to the removal of financial intermediation costs. Figure 4 compares
the responses of the model to the same shock around the same steady-state gross foreign asset
positions (the integration scenario), with and without financial intermediation costs (Panels B and
A, respectively).31 As we can see, the dynamic response of net foreign assets, the current account,
and the valuation change are qualitatively the same in the two cases.32
Returning to the comparison between home bias in equity and international financial integration, Figure 3 also shows that inducing larger steady-state gross foreign asset positions, while
keeping the degree of risk sharing through terms of trade changes and the income distribution
constant (i.e., for given ω and θ), increases risk sharing through asset markets, and aﬀects the split
of net foreign asset changes between the current account (or portfolio rebalancing) and valuation
changes. To see this, note that the consumption diﬀerentials are smaller under financial integration
(Figure 3, Panels C and D), the correlation between home and foreign consumptions is larger,
and the volatility of consumption is lower (Table 3). Since risk sharing through terms of trade
movements is the same across scenarios, we conclude that a higher degree of international financial
integration (measured by steady-state gross asset positions) enhances risk sharing through asset
markets. Though not large in absolute terms, these eﬀects increase with higher values of ω and
may have a significant impact on welfare. Valuation eﬀects are also larger on impact (amplifying
net foreign asset variation through this channel) the higher the degree of integration. However,
their share of the total change in net foreign assets is smaller than in the case of home bias in
equity. This suggests that the relative importance of valuation eﬀects in net foreign asset dynamics
decreases as we move from a less to a more integrated economy. Interestingly, going from home bias
31

The responses in Figure 4 are computed using the analytical solutions in Section 3 and the normalizations defined
there for variables with zero steady-state levels. For instance, the deviation of net foreign assets from the steady
ga
state is defined as nf
t+1 ≡ dnf at+1 / (vx), and the change in net foreign assets is the first diﬀerence of this variable
(denoted DNFAH in the figure). All γ parameters are zero in the case of no intermediation cost. In this case, net and
gross foreign asset positions depend on initial conditions and no longer revert to their initial levels after the shock.
As we discussed in Section 3, the consumption diﬀerentials and net foreign assets become unit root processes.
32
With intermediation costs, the current account and the change in net foreign assets become slightly negative
several years after the shock to ensure the return of net foreign equity holdings and net foreign assets to the initial
steady state.

28

in equity to international financial integration, a larger trade imbalance and a smaller contribution
of income balance dynamics are more important determinants of net foreign asset changes, rather
than larger valuation changes. This is seen on impact from Figure 3. The valuation change at
the time of the shock is larger in absolute value under integration, but its share of the change in
net foreign assets is smaller than under home bias. Even cumulating the response of net foreign
assets and its components over the first 40 quarters, we find that the income balance contributes
to a smaller build-up of net foreign assets (liabilities) in the home (foreign) economy under integration than home bias (Table 4). Absolute equity price diﬀerentials are smaller under financial
integration, and equity prices are more correlated across countries (Table 3), consistent with our
theoretical analysis. The intuition is that, with portfolio quantities less costly to rebalance, asset
prices need to do a smaller job in transmission. Agents are more willing to engage in international
trade in equity to smooth consumption, and asset prices play a smaller role in the transmission of
productivity shocks.
When we completely remove the financial intermediation costs, while leaving the initial gross
foreign asset positions unchanged at the integration scenario, the valuation share of net foreign
asset changes remains larger than the (negative) current account share on impact. Lowering the
intermediation cost to zero reduces the equity price diﬀerential, and hence the size of the valuation
change, and the ratio CAShare0 /V ALShare0 becomes larger (in absolute value). This happens
because it is now relatively easier to adjust asset quantities. But this does not imply that the
equilibrium change in cross-border share holdings is necessarily larger when financial fees are absent.
In fact, when intermediation costs are zero, the portfolio rebalancing term in equation (23) is
smaller, and so is the overall change in net foreign assets. As a result, the valuation share of the
initial net foreign asset change (V ALShare0 ) increases, but portfolio rebalancing plays a relatively
larger role (the absolute value of CAShare0 /V ALShare0 increases), in comparison to the scenario
with financial frictions.
Overall, removing financial frictions generates some quantitative diﬀerences, but does not aﬀect
qualitative results on impact and in the first years after a shock. The ratio of valuation change to
current account becomes smaller (in absolute value), consistent with intuition. Diﬀerences across
scenarios become more pronounced (and some qualitative diﬀerences emerge) only several years
after a shock, once the mean reversion induced by small financial frictions has had time to play
out.33
Specifically, CASharet and V ALSharet are constant in all periods following the initial one
if financial fees are absent, as shown in Section 3. Given our choice of θ, the valuation share of
net foreign asset movements after the initial impact is approximately 16.7 percent. When the γ’s
33

29

are set to 0.01, the valuation share increases from 18.8 percent one quarter after the shock to
approximately 37 percent four years after. These numbers are not distant from the magnitude
range of valuation eﬀects in Gourinchas and Rey (2005) (for the upper end) and Gros (2006) (for
the lower end).

Conclusions

Ongoing financial integration has greatly increased gross foreign asset holdings, enhancing the
scope for a “valuation channel” of external adjustment. We examine this channel of adjustment
in a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with international equity trading in incomplete
asset markets. We show that the decentralized equity market equilibrium when equities are defined
as claims to firm profits in a production economy generally does not deliver the perfect risk sharing
implied by the planning optimum, unless an appropriate system of financial taxes and transfers
is in place. Absent such a system, the risk-sharing properties of international equity trading in
decentralized markets are tied to the distribution of income between labor income and profits.
Departure from the planning optimum is necessary for both asset quantity and price changes to
play a role in net foreign asset adjustment.
We also find that for given steady-state gross foreign asset positions, valuation changes in
response to productivity shocks increase with the magnitude of financial frictions, the persistence
of shocks, and the degree of substitutability across home and foreign goods — though the latter has
no eﬀect on the share of valuation in net foreign asset changes. Increasing the size of steady-state
gross asset positions by lowering financial frictions enhances risk sharing through financial markets,
but the relative importance of the valuation channel in net foreign asset dynamics decreases.

Solving for the Steady State

No-Arbitrage under Full Cross-Shareholding

Assume γ x∗ = γ ∗x = 0 and γ ∗x∗ = γ x > 0. In the implied asymmetric steady state with full
cross-shareholding, we have:
v = v∗ =

1 β
, x = 0 = x∗∗ , x∗ = 1 = x∗ .
θ1−β

The equilibrium Euler equation for home holdings of home equity is:
´
1 ³
Et Ĉt+1 − Ĉt = βEt (v̂t+1 ) − v̂t + 2γ x̂∗t+1 + (1 − β)Et (dˆt+1 ).
σ

(80)

To write this equation in log-linear form, we used the implication of the equilibrium condition:
dxt+1 = −x̂∗t+1 x∗ = −x̂∗t+1 .

The equilibrium Euler equation for home holdings of foreign equity is:
´
1 ³
∗
Et Ĉt+1 − Ĉt = βEt (v̂t+1
) − v̂t∗ + (1 − β)Et (dˆ∗t+1 )
σ

(81)

This equation has no portfolio choice term because the corresponding equity investment costs (γ’s)
were assumed to be zero.
Subtracting equations (80) and (81) and using x̂D
t+1 = −2x̂∗t+1 yields equation (43).

Decentralizing the Planning Optimum through Financial Fee Centering

Suppose that the fee-scaling parameters are such that γ x = γ x∗ = γ ∗x = γ ∗x∗ = γ and quadratic fees
are centered around the planner’s allocation (xP ≡ a − (1 − a) (θ − 1), x∗P ≡ (1 − a) θ, xP∗ ≡ aθ,

and x∗P
∗ ≡ 1 − aθ) instead of zero holdings. The aggregate Euler equations for equity holdings
become:

for foreign households. Following the same steps as with fees centered around zero equity holdings,
steady-state versions of these equations and equity market equilibrium conditions yield x = xP ,
x∗ = x∗P , x∗ = xP∗ , x∗∗ = x∗P
∗ as unique deterministic steady state for the decentralized economy.
34

Let us turn next to the log-linearized model. Log-linear versions of equations (82)-(85) are:

³
´
¡ ∗ ¢
= −v̂t∗ + βEt v̂t+1
+ (1 − β) Et dˆ∗t+1 ,(89)

where we used the fact that v/ (v + d) = v ∗ / (v∗ + d∗ ) = β and d/ (v + d) = v ∗ / (v∗ + d∗ ) = 1 − β

in the planner’s steady state.

Log-linear asset market equilibrium conditions require:

(1 − a) θ
aθ
x̂∗ .
= −
1 − aθ t+1

x̂∗t+1 = −

(90)

x̂∗∗t+1

(91)

Subtracting (88) from (86), using (90), and rearranging yields:
´ γ [a − (1 − a) (θ − 1)]
1 ³ D
Et Ĉt+1 − ĈtD +
x̂t+1 = 0.
σ
a (1 − a)

(92)

Similarly, equations (87), (89), and (91) imply:
´
1 ³ D

It follows that optimal equity choices by home households are such that:
x̂∗t+1 =

a − (1 − a) (θ − 1)
x̂t+1 .

(94)

Now, log-linearizing home and foreign equilibrium budget constraints around the planner’s
steady state yields, respectively:

(96)

Subtracting (96) from (95), using the expressions for steady-state equity holdings, the equity market
clearing conditions (90)-(91), and equation (94) at t and t + 1, and rearranging yields:
−β [θ (1 − a) − 1] (x̂t+1 − x̂t ) + θa (1 − a) (1 − β) ĈtD = 0.

(97)

Note that optimal decentralized behavior in a neighborhood of the planner’s steady state subject
to fees centered around this point implies that the relation between the consumption diﬀerential
and growth in home holdings of home equity is independent of home and foreign GDP. Equations
(92) and (97) constitute a system of two diﬀerence equations in two endogenous variables (x̂t+1
and ĈtD ), which can be rewritten as:

The characteristic equation for the matrix M is:

⎤

⎦.

J (e) ≡ βe2 − σγθ (1 − β) e − β = 0.
Graphing the polynomial J (e) shows that its roots are always one inside and one outside the unit
circle. Hence, we can rule out sunspot equilibria, and the system (92)-(97) has unique solution
x̂t+1 = ĈtD = 0 in all periods, with initial condition x̂t = 0. Equation (94) and equity market
equilibrium then imply that holdings of all equities remain constant at the planner’s steady state.
We have thus proved that a system of quadratic fees centered around the planner’s equity
allocation and lump-sum rebates decentralize the first-best equilibrium with perfect risk sharing.35

Note that, if γ = 0, the characteristic equation for the matrix M has roots 1 and −1. The unitary root signals
the existence of the non-stationarity problem associated to the decentralized economy if equities ever move from the
steady state. Importantly, absence of an eigenvalue outside the unit circle implies that the decentralized economy
would be open to sunspot fluctuations in consumption and equities.
