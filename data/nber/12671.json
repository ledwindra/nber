    "abstract": "\n\nWe develop a framework to assess how successfully standard times eries models explain low-frequency variability of a data series.  The low-frequency information is extracted by computing a finite number of weighted averages of the original data, where the weights are low-frequency trigonometric series.  The properties of these weighted averages are then compared to the asymptotic implications of a number of common time series models.  We apply the framework to twenty U.S. macroeconomic and financial time series using frequencies lower than the business cycle.\n\n",
