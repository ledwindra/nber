Monetarist Monetary Policy, Exchange Risk,
and Exchange Rate Variability
ABSTRACT

This paper investigates the relationship between the new monetary control
procedures, implemented by the Federal Reserve Board in October l979, and
the subsequent increase in exchange rate variability for the United States.
It shows that, in the context of a stochastic, rational expectations model,
exchan.ge rate variability minimizing monetary policy is identical to the

policy which, in a deterministic, perfect foresight model, would place the
economy on the borderline between exchange rate overshooting and undershoot—

ing. The model is estimated for the United States since generalized
floating began in 1973. The new monetary control procedures have had two

opposite effects. Monetary policy has become less acconodative, increasing
exchange rate variability through overshooting. On the other hand,
systematic deviations from uncovered interest rate parity, which can be

attributed to exchange risk, have also increased. These increase exchange
rate variability through undershooting. It is shown that the latter dominate
the

former, providing an explanation of increased exchange rate variability

consistent with undershooting, not with overshooting.

I. Introduction
The new monetary control procedures, implemented by the Federal

Reserve Board in October 1979, have been the subject of extensive

scrutiny. One major item of interest has been the impact of these
procedures on financial markets in general and, in particular, on the

foreign exchange market. A focus of this interest has been on exchange
rate variability which, like the variability of other financial assets,
has increased substantially since 19791.

This paper considers the relationship between the conduct of

monetary policy and the variability of exchange rates2. It shows
that, in the context of a stochastic, rational expectations model,

exchange rate variability minimizing monetary policy is identical to the
policy which, in a deterministic, perfect foresight model, would place
the economy on the borderline between exchange rate overshooting and

undershooting. Policy which would cause either overshooting or
undershooting would increase variability.
In this context, the change in the conduct of monetary policy in
the United States can be expected to have two opposite effects.
Monetary policy which is less acconinodative of prices and/or interest

rates, "monetarist" monetary policy, can affect exchange rate

variability through overshooting. On the other hand, the change in the
conduct of monetary policy was accompanied by a good deal of uncertainty

regarding the exact nature of the new policy. It is shown below how
this increase in uncertainty, or increase in exchange risk, will
increase deviations from uncovered interest rate parity in a predictable

manner. These deviations, in turn, can affect exchange rate variability
through undershooting.

Using constrained maximum likelihood methods, the model is
estimated for the United States since generalized floating began in

1973. The estimation procedures incorporate both the rational

expectations restrictions and the policy rules. Over the period 1973—79,
the dollar experienced slight undershooting. Over the full period,
1973-82, the effects of less accommodative monetary policy were

overwhelmed by those of the increase in exchange risk, causing exchange

rate undershooting. The explanation of increased exchange rate variability
as being caused by undershooting, as opposed to overshooting: is
confirmed by estimating a less constrained version of the model within
which the undershooting hypothesis can be directly tested.

The model is presented in Section II. In Section III, it is shown
how variable output, risk aversion, and accommodative monetary policy

affect exchange rate variability. The model is estimated in Section IV
and conclusions are presented in Section V.

II. The Model
The model is based on Dornbusch (1976), although it extends his

work in a number of directions. It is a two-country model,
incorporating variable output, deviations from uncovered interest rate
parity, and both domestic and foreign money supply reaction functions.

The two country specification, rather than a single, small country
specification, was chosen to avoid making exogeneity assumptions
regarding foreign prices and interest rates which cannot be supported
empirically and to allow for the foreign money supply, as well as the

domestic money supply, to be determined endogenously. This is shown
below to be quite important, both theoretically and empirically, in

determining the magnitude of exchange rate variability. In order to
provide clear theoretical results that could be tested empirically, a
number of simplifying assumptions were made so that the model could be

solved analytically. The model consists 0f the following equations:

Recent empirical work by Cumby and Obstfeld (1983) and Hansen and

Hodrick (1983) provides evidence that this relationship does not hold
for most bilateral exchange rates, even when there do not appear to be

constraints on the mobility of capital between the countries involved.

In particular, the evidence suggests that risk premia are significant

and vary over time. For the United States' effective
additional

exchange rate, an

consideration is that, while capital may be perfectly mobile

with regard to the U.S., the weighted average of countries that
comprises the foreign "country" includes some, such as Japan, that
clearly restricted capital flows over at least part of the sample period.

Much

supplies

of wealth, that are beyond the scope of this paper. Instead,

we use some of the concepts in Dornbusch's (1983) mean-variance model of
international portfolio choice to relate deviations from uncovered
interest rate parity to deviations from purchasing power parity.

We begin by formaliziRg the relationship between real interest
rates in the two countries and the structure of expected real asset

returns faced by investors in either country. By the Fisher relation
with pre-determined prices, either country's real interest rate equals
its nominal interest rate minus its expected, (equal to actual), rate of

From the perspective of a domestic investor, the real return on a

domestic asset (Rt) is just the domestic real interest rate. His or
her expected real return, (in terms of purchasing power over domestic

goods), on a foreign asset (R) is the foreign interest rate plus the
expected rate of depreciation minus the domestic inflation rate,

The choices faced by a foreign investor can be similarly described. The

foreign investor's real return on a foreign asset (F*) is the foreign

real interest rate, His or her real return on a domestic asset (F) is
the domestic interest rate minus the expected rate of depreciation minus

the foreign inflation rate. The foreign investors real return
differential is the same as that faced by the domestic investor,

The assumption of long run purchasing power parity in a linear, rational

expectations model ensures that an overvalued exchange rate (et >

expected real depreciation. This can be seen by considering

all possible monotonic adjustment paths toward the steady state

It should be noted that this statement contains

no implications about the expected (or actual) movement of the nominal
exchange rate.

Consider the case where

Now consider risk aversion. Since

nominal interest rates are known and price levels are pre-deterniined,

the only source of risk is exchange rate risk. From the perspective of
a domestic investor, since foreign assets are riskier, the real return
on foreign assets must exceed the real return on domestic assets

(R >

R)

to induce investment in foreign assets. From the

perspective of a foreign investor, domestic assets are riskier, and it is

necessary for Ft > F to induce investment in them.

These two

conditions cannot occur simultaneously. With the world consisting of
two countries, if one is a net lender the other must be a net borrower.
Assuming that the real interest rate is the marginal product of capital,
and assuming away all other considerations, such as differences in
tastes, size, wealth, liquidity characteristics, and risk aversion, that
could influence borrowing and lending, the country with the higher real

rate of interest will borrow and the other will lend. In this case,

which is both equations (4g) and (4).
Equation (4) relates deviations form uncovered interest rate parity

to deviations from purchasing power parity in a systematic manner. The
parameter a7 represents both the degree of risk aversion on the part

of investors and the degree of risk in the market. With risk
neutrality, a7 =

0.

The more risk averse are investors, the larger is

a7. If there is no exchange risk, a7

=

0.

The greater the exchange

risk, the larger is a7.

The equation was derived, using risk aversion, assuming perfect

capital mobility. An identical equation is derived, using a flow
capital mobility specification, in Frenkel and Rodriguez (1982) and

Papell (1983). In those models, the current account balance is
postulated to depend on relative prices and the (flow) capital account
to depend on the expectations adjusted interest rate differential.
Using the constraint that, in the absence of central bank intervention,
the current and capital accounts sum to zero, equation (4) is derived,

10

The parameter a7 represents the degree of capital mobility, with

a7 = 0 being perfect mobility.
While these models are observationally equivalent from

any single

country at a point in time, they have the potential to be differentiated
either by estimating a cross-section of countries or by estimating one

country over different tine periods. In this case, the hypothesis to be
tested is that the change in the Fed's operating procedure increased

uncertainty in financial markets, including the market for foreign

exchange. This increase in foreign exchange risk increased the required
expected real return differential for investing abroad, which would

increase a7. The alternative explanation for a rise in a7, a
decrease in the mobility of capital since 1979, does not seem tenable.
Thus testing the model over these two periods for the United States
provides the potential for differentiating between them.
The money supply for each country depends on the exchange rate, the

difference between domestic and foreign prices, and the nominal interest

rate differential. Monetery policy for either country is accommodative
if that country's money supply increases when its exchange rate
depreciates, when the difference between its prices and the other
country's prices increases and/or when its nominal interest rate

differential increases. Thus positive coefficients for

a3

a13 are

accommodative, negative coefficients are offsetting. The money supply
is constrained to respond to the price ratio, rather than to the levels
separately, because, in the reduced form of the model, prices appear

only in ratio form. While allowing the money supplies to respond
separately to domestic and foreign price levels would be desirable, it

would make the model analytically intractible. A number of analysts

11

have proposed that the money supply be decreased when the rei exchange
rate depreciates and increased when it appreciates. This would involve
offsetting the exchange rate and acconiiiodating the price ratio so that

a8 =

- a and a11 =

- a12.

The money supply rule for each

country also includes an exogenous term and a stochastic disturbance
term.

III. Exchange Rate Variability
In this section, we solve the model and show how variable output,
risk aversion7, and accommodative monetary policy affect exchange rate

variability.

We then describe the relationship between variability and

the concepts of overshooting and undershooting.
Before solving the model, it is useful to simplify the price

adjustment, output, and money supply equations. Substituting (4a) and
(4) into (3), and collecting terms, we obtain,

It can be seen from (9) that the degree of a risk aversion affects the

use of interest rate targets for the conduct of monetary policy. If the
money supply accommodates the interest rate differential, (a10, a13 >

0),

then monetary policy becomes more offsetting towards the exchange rate

but more accommodative towards prices. The magnitude of these effects
depends on the degree of risk aversion. If investors were risk neutral
(a7 =

0),

interest rate targeting would not affect the degree of

accommodation.

variables as deviations from their steady state equilibrium values, we
obtain:

requires substituting (11) into (10) and solving the resultant set of

identities. As is usual in rational expectations models with
expectations of future values of variables, the solution is not unique
without the usual assumption that the conditionally expected exchange

rate and price paths are stable. In addition, we need to assume that
the money supply either offsets or is not too accommodative of exchange
rate movements, so that

stability assumption will produce a unique solution. Assuming that the

Exchange rate variability can be characterized either by the

different time periods. The conditional variance of the exchange rate

The sign of 2 is determined by the income (a1)

elasticity and the interest rate (a2) semi—elasticity of the demand
for money, the elasticity of the demand for output with respect to the
real exchange rate (d3), the degree of risk aversion on the part of

investors (a7), and the degree of accommodation of domestic (c2)
and foreign (c4) money supplies to price movements. It should be
stressed that output variability, risk aversion, and accommodative
monetary policy all decrease 62.

15

The intuition behind these results is provided by examining the

relationship between exchange rate variability and overshooting. In
response to a permanent, unanticipated increase in (for example) the
money supply, which causes a proportionate long run depreciation of the
exchange rate, overshooting occurs if the exchange rate first
depreciates by more than its long run value, and then appreciates over

time back to the steady state. Undershooting occurs if the exchange
rate first depreciates by less than its long run value, and then

continues to depreciate until the steady state is attained. In Papeil
(1983b), it is shown that in the perfect foresight version of the flow
capital mobility version of this model, 62 = 0 is the borderline case

between overshooting and undershooting. Overshooting occurs when
62 > 0, undershooting when 62 < 0.

It is important to remember that,

at any instant of time, prices are pre-determined while the exchange

rate is free to jump. When 62 =

0,

the exchange rate immediately

jumps to its new long run equilibrium value. This corresponds, in the
present stochastic context, to zero conditional and minimum asymptotic
exchange rate variability.

The overshooting hypothesis was motivated as an explanation for

high exchange rate variability. Our results show that there is not a
one—to-one relation between variability and overshooting. High exchange
rate variability can be produced by undershooting as well as

overshooting. Furthermore, changes in the structural and policy
parameter which decrease ó2 (and hence reduce overshooting), only
will be certain to decrease variability if the country begins at a
position of overshooting and does not move into undershooting.

Otherwise, variability may actually be increased. For example, consider

16

a country that is characterized by overshooting. By making monetary
policy more accommodative of prices, (either directly or through
accommodating interest rates), exchange rate variability can be reduced.
If monetary policy becomes too accommodative, undershooting will result
and variability increased.

IV. Empirical

Results

We now examine the effects of the changes in the conduct of
monetary policy in the United States since October 1979.

In order to

accomplish this, using quarterly data, we estimate the model separately
for the periods 1973 (II) — 1979 (III) and 1973 (II) — 1982 (III), and

then compare the results. The model is estimated by constrained maximum
likelihood techniques, with the constraints on the parameters caused by
the form of the structural equations, assumption of rational

expectations, and the stability condition necessary to achieve a unique

solution. The structural (a1 - a7) and policy (a8

a13)

coefficients are jointly estimated. Combined with the imposition of
rational expectations, this satisfies several aspects of Lucas (1976)
critique of econometric policy evaluation.
Estimation of the model first requires deriving the reduced form.

Substituting the expression for e from (10) into (4), (8), and
(9) and taking variables as deviations from their steady state values,
we obtain:

it is necessary to make some assumptions about the structure of the

error terms. We assume that they are generated by first order

autoregressive processes, i.e.,

where the tb's are serially uricorrelated. We then take the infinite

moving average representation implicit in the above autoregressive

process and truncate it at third order for u1 and fourth order for the

others. This produces a first order autoregressive fourth order moving
average model. Assuming that expectations are determined rationally and
solving by the method of undetermined coefficients, the reduced form of

and A and B are 2 x 2

The elements of A and B

are non—linear combinations of the S's, y's, and ct's. The v's are
combinations of the f's, written so as to make the zero lag coefficient

matrix the identity matrix.11 The model to be estimated consists of
equations (13) -

(17).

Maximum likelihood estimates (conditional on the

initial disturbances being set equal to zero) are obtained under the

assumption that (v1 v2. u3. u4 u u6t)' is multivariate normal. The
Davidon-Fletcher-powell algorithm is used to find the optimum.

As described above, the model is estimated for the United States,
beginning with the advent of generalized floating in 1973 (II) and
ending either in 1979 (III), before the change in the Fed's operating

procedure, or in 1982(111). While it would have been preferable to
estimate the model over non-overlapping sub—periods, this was precluded

by the limited number of quarterly observations since 1979. We
considered using monthly data, but it did not seem sensible to estimate
monthly money demand, output demand, and money supply equations without

incorporating lags. Unfortunately, incorporating lags was precluded by
our desire to keep the model analytically representable. Our results
should therefore be interpreted with caution, remembering that, if the
data were available, the model would be estimated separately for the

period since 1979 (III).

19

We use the effective exchange rate (MERM) calculated by the

International Monetary Fund. Real GNP (or GDP) is used to measure
output, MI for the money supply, the GNP deflator for the price level,
and representative three month money market rates for the interest rate.

The foreign variables were constructed by taking weighted averages, with

the weights taken from those used to construct the MERM rates. In order
to achieve stationarity, all variables, after taking logarithms (except
for the interest rate), were detrended by regression on a constant and a

linear time trend.1
We use a two-step method of estimation. First, we estimate the
money market equilibrium equation (I) by a single equation method, and
then use the estimates from the regression as constants for the
constrained maximum likelihood estimates13. •There are several

advantages to this procedure, First, it enables us to get estimates of
the income elasticity and the interest rate semi-elasticity of the
demand for money directly from data on income and interest rates.
Second, the unstable nature of money demand estimates during the 1970's
raises the possibility that these parameters are inconsistently

estimated. In that case, estimating them by maximum likelihood would
spread inconsistency throughout the model. Finally, it reduces the
number of parameters to be estimated by maximum likelihood. The
disadvantages of the procedure are twofold. First, if the inconsistency
in the money demand estimates is caused by the use of single equation

methods this may introduce inconsistency into the model. Second,
because for the maximum likelihood procedure it is assumed that a1 and
a2 are estimated without error, the standard errors of the other

variables will be biased downward.'4

20

The maximum likelihood estimates of the structural (a3 —

a7),

policy (a8 - a13) and, serial correlation (a1 - a6) parameters are given
in

Table 1 along with their asymptotic

at-ratios", the ratio of the

coefficients to their standard errors computed from the inverse of the

second derivative matrix of the likelihood function. Single equation
estimates

for a1 and a2, as well as parameter values for the reduced

form coefficients implied by the estimates, are also presented.
The central result of the estimates is that 62 is close to zero
(-

.09) during 1973-79 and negative (-2.58) during 1973-82, indicating

that

the observed increase in exchange rate variability was caused, not

by overshooting, but by undershooting. The principal reason for this
was the dramatic change in the risk parameter (a7), which increased
from

.56

to 3.17, With the decrease in the interest rate

semi-elasticity

of the demand for money being comparatively small,

a2a7 increased from .39 to 1.90, causing much of the decline in

62. By way of illustration, if a7 stayed at .57 while all the other
parameters
.07.

took on their 1973—82 estimates, the value of 62 would

be

Another important determinant in the change in 62 is the decrease

in the real interest rate semi-elasticity of output demand (a4), which
by causing d4 to decrease, increases 62 (in absolute value) by
decreasing its denominator. With 62 close to zero, (as in the 1973-79
estimates) B1 will be close to zero whatever the values of i (the
stable root) and 61. With 62 not close to zero, (as in 1973—82),
the values of

and

matter. Changes in

between the two

periods were small. The value of 61 increased during 1973—82, making
(A1 -

less

negative. This affect, however, was swamped by the

increase (in absolute value) of 62, causing B1 to increase from
.08 to .71 between the periods.
21

We now examine the changes in the money supply reaction functions.
For the United States, looking directly at the structural parameter, the
money supply because more accommodative of prices, (a9 increased from
1,43 to 1.79), but more offsetting of interest rates, (a10 decreases

from -.94 to -1.14). However, when one includes the offsetting of
prices implicit in offsetting interest rates with a positive risk
parameter, (c2

a9 +

a7a10), domestic monetary policy (c,j switched

from being quite accommodative (.90) to very offsetting (-1.82). With
foreign monetary policy, in contrast, the direct and combination results

coincide. There is a decrease in the amount that foreign monetary
policy offsets prices, (a12 changes from -1.19 to —.81), and a switch
from offsetting to accommodating interest rates, (a13 increases from

—.61 to .19). Including the impact of the risk parameter, foreign
monetary policy becomes less offsetting of prices; c4 increases from

-1.56 to -.21. The switch from accommodative to offsetting monetary
policy in the United States dominates the decrease in offsetting abroad;
+

c4

decreases from -.66 to -2.03. Taken in isolation, this would

have caused exchange rate overshooting. The increase in the risk
parameter, however, dominates the increase in offsetting monetary policy
to cause undershooting.

Since 2 is not estimated directly, but is implied by the values
of the estimated coefficients, it is legitimate to ask how significant

is the undershooting result for the 1973—82 estimates. In order to
answer that question, a semi-constrained° version of the model was

estimated. In this version,

and 62 are estimated directly,

rather than being implied by the structural and policy coefficients. All
of the other coefficients of the model are estimated as in the

constrained version above, This enables us to test for undershooting
22

directly by examining the sign and significance level of 66. The
results of this procedure support the results found above, with
62 =

-.26

(-.36) for 1973-82 and -2.18 (-2.65) for 1973-82, (asymptotic

"t—ratios" are in parentheses). This indicates not only that the
undershooting result is not simply a construct of the structural and
policy parameters but also that it is significant'5.

Another possibility which we consider is that the deviations form
uncovered interest rate parity in the 1973-82 estimates were caused by

the imposition of credit controls in 1980. Interest rates in the United
States, (and the interest rate differential), were very high in 1980 (I).

With the credit controls, they fell dramatically in 1980 (II) and (III),

but returned to almost their original levels in 1980 (IV). In order to
test whether the increase in the estimated value of a7 was caused by the

controls, we replaced the actual values of the interest rate
differential in 1980 (II) and (III) with values that were calculated by

taking the figure for 1980 (I) and (IV) and interpolating. We then
estimated the model for 1973-82, and found that a7 was 2.76 (2.61).

This indicates that most of the increase in a7 was not caused by the

imposition of credit controls. Using the same data, we estimated the
semi—constrained version of the model, and found that 62 equaled —2.44

(-9.54). Thus the undershooting results are not affected by correcting
for credit controls.

We have characterized the changes in exchange rate variability
strictly in terms of changes in B1 which, while appropriate for
conditional variability, is not necessarily appropriate for asymptotic

variability. In order to consider asymptotic variability, we have to
examine the parameters of the price adjustment equation (y and

23

Note that both parameters change very little over the periods and that
is quite small (.04), indicating that we can approximately
characterize asymptotic variability in terms of

and

Thus the

above analysis of conditional variability also applies to asymptotic
variability.

We conclude by evaluating the success of the estimates. The
positive result is that the individual parameter estimates are very

successful. All of the estimates, (except for the relative price

elasticity of output demand), are of the "correct sign. For 1973-82,
most of the parameters are significant; for 1973—79, the results are

mixed. It is especially noteworthy that the risk parameter, upon which
much of the analysis rests, is small and insignificant for 1973—79 and

large and significant for 1973—82. In addition, the correlations
between the actual and predicted values of the variable are fairly

high.16 The negative result is provided by the likelihood ratio test.
Comparing the constrained version of the model to an I!unconstraifledtl
version, which imposes the same policy equations (15-16) and serial

correlation structure as the constrained version described above, but
does not impose the forms of the structural equations or the rational

expectations restrictions, we can reject the constrained model at

standard significance levels for both periods17. This accords with
the results of previous work involving the United States since 1973,
including Driskill and Scheffrin (1981), Glaessner (1982), and Papell
(1983b)18.

24

V. Conclusion
In this paper, we investigate the relationship between the changes

in the conduct of monetary policy in the United States following the new
monetary control procedures in October 1979 and the increase in exchange

rate variability experienced since then. We find two major effects,
although the estimation procedures necessatated by the small number of
observations since 1979 suggest that our results be interpreted with

caution. American monetary policy has become substantially less
accommodative and there has been a significant increase in the risk
parameter measuring systematic deviations from uncovered interest rate

parity. Our estimation results indicate that the latter dominates the
former, providing an explanation of increased exchange rate variability

consistent with exchange rate undershooting. This is in contrast with
the generally accepted association between high variability and
overshooting.

Levich (1981) and Truman and others (1981) provide evidence on the
increase in exchange rate variability in the first year following
the new monetary control procedures.

Truman (1981) and Black (1982) also consider this issue, but in the
context of quite different models from this paper.

Deflating the money supply in each country by a price index

composed of a weighted average of domestically produced goods and
imports makes only a minor theoretical difference by introducing

another possible channel for undershooting. Empirically, however,
it is impossible to identify the weights in a two country model of

this type. For the estimation, we use the GNP deflator as the
price level. This incorporates the exchange rate and foreign price
level into the domestic price level through imports of intermediate
goods, but not through imports of consumer goods.

We have imposed the constraint that b3 =

b4, which is necessary

because the real interest rate enters equation (3) in difference

form, on a6 but not on a5. If the constraint was applied
consistently, equation (3) would read,
(3')

-

= b3 a3(et -

- b3a4(r

When the model was estimated with this constraint, it was clearly

rejected in favor of the model reported in the text. We felt that
the misspecification from the unsupported constraint was worse than
the inconsistency in the less constrained model.

29

&

Mussa (1981, 1982) argues that a superior formulation to Dornbush's
price equation would have the rate of inflation equal the expected
rate of change of the equilibrium price level, plus some proportion
(<1) of the difference between the equilibrium and the actual price

level. As emphasized both by Mussa and by Obstfeld and Rogoff
(1983), Dornbusch's price equation is inappropriate either when
disturbances become anticipated long before they occur or when the

long run equilibrium of the economy moves over time. Neither
situation is considered in this paper.
6

Dornbusch's price level was a weighted average of domestic and

import price levels. This does not affect the results.
7

We use the term "risk aversion" in this section as a shorthand for
saying "either an increase in the level of risk aversion or in the
degree of exchange risk" repeatedly.

8

Serial correlation of the disturbances has only a minor effect on

the theoretical results. We incorporate serially correlated
disturbances in the empirical work.
9

Meese and Singleton (1980) use the variance of the first difference

of the exchange rate. This concept is similar to ours given the
different methods used to achieve stationarity. Frankel (1983) and
Frenkel and Mussa (1980) use the conditional variance around the
forward rate, while Flood (1981) uses the conditional variance

around the expected spot rate. These measures are appropriate if
it is desired to equate the concepts of risk and variability.
Since we do not wish to make normative statements about
variability, we have no need to equate these two concepts.

If 62 and

B1

are of opposite signs, ll, will decrease if

0. It is possible that the decrease in

the increases in B and

outweights

to decrease s. This is

the only case where B1 = 0 does not minimize the asymptotic

variance. The conditional variance is always minimized when
B1 =
11

0.

We do not impose the cross error constraints between the v's and

the u's. Otherwise, there would be contemporaneous correlation
among the errors and the estimates would be inconsistent.
12

The interest rates used for the estimation were representative

money market rates, taken from World Financial Markets. All other
data were taken from International Financial Statistics. The real
output, price level, and money supply data were seasonally

adjusted. The countries (and weights) used for constructing the
foreign variables were; Canada (.263), France (.131), Germany

(.168),
13

Italy (.097), Japan (.275) and the United Kingdom (.066).

We used the ARI procedure of TSP, which provides efficient
estimates of an equation whose disturbances display first order
serial correlation.

14

We tested these conjectures by estimating all of the parameters of

the model by maximum likelihood. The major problem was that the
interest rate semi—elasticity of the demand for money was positive

for both time periods. Rehm (1983) was able to get plausible
maximum likelihood estimates for (in our notation) a1 and a2
for the United States by incorporating lags in the money demand
specification, an option precluded in this paper by the desire for

an analytic solution. Using maximum likelihood estimates of a1

31

and a2 that appear to be clearly misspecified seemed to be a
worse choice than adopting the technique used in the paper.
15

Since the parameters a1 and a2 enter the model only through the
definitions of

and 62 in (10), and since 61 and 62 are

not constrained in this version, the values of a1 and a2 are

irrelevant. Thus the support for undershooting provided by
estimating the semi-constrained version is not contingent on the
questions involved in the estimation of the money demand
parameters.
16

One disturbing aspect of the estimates is that

the serial
cii,

correlation coefficient in the exchange rate equation, is greater
than unity for 1973 (III) - 1982 (III). We experimented with both
a second order autoregressive and third order moving average

representation for u1, but the result did not change. We also
attempted to estimate the model using first -differenced, rather
than detrended, data but could not get the estimates to converge at
an optimum.

17

The unconstrained log likelihood is 517.875 for 1973—79 and 679.176

for 1973—82. There are 17 parameters in the constrained version;
22 in the unconstrained version.
18

Driskill and Sheffrin (1981) and Papell (1983a) use maximum

likelihood estimates and likelihood ratio tests. Glaessner (1982)
uses generalized method of moments estimates and chi-squared test.
