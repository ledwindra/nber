Perspectives on U.S. Monetary Policy Tools and Instruments
James D. Hamilton
NBER Working Paper No. 25911
May 2019
JEL No. E4,E5
ABSTRACT
The Federal Reserve characterizes its current policy decisions in terms of targets for the fed funds
rate and the size of its balance sheet. The fed funds rate today is essentially an administered rate
that is heavily influenced by regulatory arbitrage and divorced from its traditional role as a signal
of liquidity in the banking system. The size of the Fed’s balance sheet is at best a very blunt
instrument for influencing interest rates. In this paper I compare the current operating system with
the historical U.S. system and the procedures of other central banks. I then examine strategies for
transitioning from the current system to one that would give the Federal Reserve more accurate
tools with which to achieve its strategic objective of influencing inflation and output.

1. Introduction.
This paper discusses the policy instruments that the central bank uses in pursuit of its
broader strategic objectives of influencing variables like inflation and output. For many decades,
the primary instrument of U.S. monetary policy was the federal funds rate, which is an interest
rate on overnight loans of Federal Reserve deposits between depository institutions. When this
rate fell essentially to zero in 2009, the Fed implemented massive purchases of Treasury
securities and mortgage-backed securities as an alternative policy instrument with which it hoped
to influence longer-term interest rates. Although the fed funds rate is no longer at the effective
lower bound, today the Fed continues to treat both the fed funds rate and its holdings of
securities as policy instruments.
I review the current operating procedures and conclude that neither instrument is well
suited for achieving the Fed’s broader strategic objectives. The fed funds rate has become a
largely administered rate that is heavily influenced by regulatory arbitrage and divorced from its
traditional role as a signal of liquidity in the banking system. To the extent that the size of the
Fed’s balance sheet matters today, it is primarily from the liabilities rather than the asset side of
the balance sheet, with the size of the balance sheet at best a very blunt tool for influencing
interest rates. I discuss alternative possible operating procedures such as a corridor system based
on repurchase agreements.
Section 2 reviews the effects of the Fed’s asset holdings on long-term interest rates over
2009 to 2019. I conclude that this instrument has less influence on interest rates than is
sometimes believed. Section 3 describes a traditional corridor system such as used by the
European Central Bank. Sections 4 and 5 discuss the discount rate and interest on excess
reserves, respectively, tools that could in principal operate like the ceiling and floor of a corridor

1

system but in U.S. practice have not. Section 6 discusses the reverse repo rate and argues that
this policy rate is the true floor on short-term interest rates in the current system. Section 7 notes
how the operation of the system changed in 2018. Section 8 concludes with some thoughts on
how the U.S. could transition to a system that would give the Federal Reserve more accurate
tools with which to influence inflation and output.

2. The effects of large-scale asset purchases.
Figure 1 displays the Fed’s holdings of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities. These
rose from $500 billion at the start of 2009 to $4.5 trillion by 2017. These purchases are
sometimes described as “quantitative easing,” and were implemented in three phases popularly
referred to as QE1, QE2, and QE3. In November of 2017, the Fed stopped some of its purchases
of new securities, allowing its holdings of securities to gradually decline to a level of $3.8 trillion
as of May 2019.
In many standard macroeconomic and finance models, if the nominal interest rate is zero,
purchases of securities by the central bank would have no effects on any real or nominal variable
of interest; see for example Eggertsson and Woodford (2003). As discussed by Hamilton (2018),
adding various financial frictions to the models can change that prediction; see among others
Cúrdia and Woodford (2011), Gertler and Karadi, (2011), Chen, Cúrdia and Ferrero (2012),
Hamilton and Wu (2012), Woodford (2012), Greenwood and Vayanos (2014), Eggertsson and
Proulx (2016), and Caballero and Farhi (2017). However, it is not clear from theory how large
the potential stimulus arising from these channels could be.
A number of empirical studies concluded that QE1-3 were successful in their goal of
bringing down long-term interest rates; for surveys of this literature see Williams (2014), Borio

2

and Zabai (2018), and Swanson (2018). It is useful to put these claims in perspective. Figure 2,
updated from Woodford (2012), plots the behavior of the interest rate on 10-year Treasury bonds
over this period. On net this rate rose during QE1 when the Fed was trying to bring it down, fell
when QE1 ended, rose in QE2 when the Fed again resumed its efforts to lower long-term rates,
dropped after QE2 was halted, only to rise again in QE3. One can of course claim that, if the Fed
had not been purchasing bonds, the rate would have risen even more than it did during the QE1-3
episodes. But at a minimum we are forced to conclude that Fed purchases were only one of
many factors influencing bond yields during these episodes, and certainly not the most important
factor.
One way we might try to isolate the effects of Fed actions is to focus only on the
particular days when the FOMC issued a statement or released its minutes or when the Fed Chair
gave a speech on the economy or monetary policy. Figure 3, adapted from Greenlaw et al.
(2018), shows the cumulative change in the 10-year yield that occurred on those days alone.
Figure 3 turns out to show the same broad pattern as Figure 2—yields on average rose, not fell,
during QE1-3, even if we focus on just days in which the Fed made an announcement.
Many researchers have conducted event studies using a subset of days on which there
were particularly important announcements of the Fed’s intentions to implement additional
large-scale asset purchases. But the analysis of some of these days by Hamilton (2018) and
Levin and Loungani (2019) suggest that previous studies may have overestimated the role of the
purchases in moving interest rates. One key question is the extent to which interest rates were
responding to the Fed’s assessment of the economic situation rather than to the purchases
themselves. See Melosi (2016), Nakamura and Steinsson (2018), and Miranda-Agrippino and
Ricco (2018) for more discussion of this issue.

Regardless of one’s position on whether large-scale asset purchases are an important tool
when the traditional instrument of controlling the fed funds rate is unavailable, the case for its
importance in 2019 when short rates are significantly above zero is far from compelling. I
conclude below that the primary relevance of the size of the Fed’s balance sheet today for the
conduct of monetary policy comes from the liabilities side rather than any tangible consequences
of its asset holdings for long-term interest rates. But before returning to that issue, I first discuss
alternative monetary procedures for controlling the short-term interest rate.
3. The corridor system for controlling short-term interest rates.
The European Central Bank is one of many central banks that use a corridor system as its
primary policy instrument. The ECB stands ready to lend banks as much as they want at a
particular rate

that is set by policy. This sets a ceiling on short-term loans between banks.

Why should I pay more than
ECB at

to borrow from another bank when I can get all I want from the

? The ECB sets another rate

on funds that are left on deposit with the ECB. One

can think of these as short-term loans from private banks to the ECB. The rate

sets a floor on

the interest rate on interbank loans. Why should I lend to another bank for less than
can earn

when I

risk-free just by leaving my funds with the ECB? The policy instruments are the

ECB’s choices for

and

which define a corridor within which the interbank loan rate trades,

as seen in Figure 4. Since June 2014 the ECB has charged a fee rather than pay interest on
deposits (essentially a negative value for

) which it has used to cause interest rates to become

negative.
It’s worth remembering that the core power that gives the central bank the ability to
specify

and

as instruments of policy is its ability to create new deposits of private banks

with the ECB. This is what enables the central bank to satisfy all demand for borrowing at the

4

chosen

. By choosing particular values for

and

the ECB is implicitly committing to a

level and growth rate of the monetary base which may or may not be consistent with its broader
strategic inflation objective. Indeed, one could think of monetary policy equivalently either as a
decision for

and

or as a decision about monetary aggregates. Modern economic theory

(e.g., Woodford, 2003) and central bank practice usually adopt the former perspective,
essentially for reasons described by Poole (1970): the demand for monetary aggregates can be
very volatile, making targeting interest rates a more reliable tool than targeting monetary
aggregates for purposes of stabilizing inflation and real activity
4. The Federal Reserve’s discount window.
Like the ECB, the U.S. Federal Reserve historically offered to lend to banks at a policydetermined rate

through its discount window. Figure 5 compares the fed funds rate with the

discount rate. Over most of the last half century, the fed funds rate was above the discount rate.
In the U.S.,

served as a floor, not a ceiling for the fed funds rate!

Why would I pay another bank an interest rate higher than

to borrow funds? The

answer is that U.S. banks traditionally imputed some nonpecuniary costs to borrowing at the
discount window. Although the identities of banks that borrowed at the discount window was
not publicly released, other banks could usually find out who had borrowed, and borrowing from
the discount window was associated with a certain stigma. Banks only wanted to borrow at the
discount window if they had trouble borrowing fed funds from other banks, which could be a
sign of weakness.
Banks differed in their perceived nonpecuniary costs and would turn to the discount
window when the marginal nonpecuniary cost was less than the spread between the fed funds
rate and the discount rate. Figure 6, adapted from Goodfriend and Whelpley (1986), illustrates

5

how the fed funds rate was determined in this system. The Fed’s open-market operations
resulted in a certain level of nonborrowed reserves, which are deposits with the Fed that banks
would have even if they do no borrowing at the discount window. As the fed funds rate rises
above the discount rate, more banks would be willing to borrow at the discount window, thereby
increasing the total supply of nonborrowed plus borrowed reserves until supply equals demand.
Figure 7 compares the gap between the fed funds rate and the discount rate (top panel)
with the total volume of discount window borrowing (bottom panel), showing how the system
worked in practice. A higher value for the fed funds rate relative to the discount rate was
associated with a higher volume of borrowing. Indeed, some observers at the time thought of the
operating system as one of borrowed reserves targeting rather than fed funds rate targeting.
5. Interest on excess reserves.
Beginning in October 2008, the Federal Reserve began paying an interest rate on excess
reserves (IOER), akin to the interest rate

in a corridor system. Figure 8 shows the recent

relation between the fed funds rate and IOER. Whereas

acts as a floor in the traditional

corridor system, until very recently IOER seemed to be a ceiling on the fed funds rate! Indeed,
at times IOER looked like a deterministic ceiling. On most days, the average effective fed funds
rate would be exactly 9 basis points below the interest on excess reserves, though it would drop
significantly below on the last day of the month.
Why would anyone offer to lend at a fed funds rate below IOER if they could earn IOER
just by parking the funds with the Fed? The answer is that not all depository institutions can earn
IOER. Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLB) have deposits with the Fed but are not paid IOER, so
they have an incentive to lend to banks that can earn IOER. But why wouldn’t banks that can
earn IOER bid up the fed funds rate so as to earn the risk-free arbitrage from borrowing at the

6

fed funds rate and earning IOER? Part of the answer is on the supply side; individual Federal
Home Loan Banks set limits on to whom and how much they lend. Afonso, Armenter, and Lester
(2019) modeled these frictions using a search and matching model for the fed funds market.
Another factor is nonpecuniary costs on the demand side, as discussed by Klee, Senyuz, and
Yoldas (2016), Banegas and Tase (2017) and Anbil and Senyuz (2018). If a bank tries to
arbitrage by borrowing fed funds and holding fed deposits to earn IOER, it expands its balance
sheet. A larger level of assets exposes U.S. banks to higher fees from the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation. For this reason, foreign banks are a more natural counterparty than
domestic banks to borrow the fed funds from the FHLB. In addition, both domestic and foreign
banks are subject to complicated capital requirements, another source of nonpecuniary costs
associated with borrowing fed funds. A larger balance sheet may require the bank to make other
adjustments to meet capital requirements, which imposes another nonpecuniary cost on
arbitraging the IOER-fed funds spread. For European banks, the capital requirements are
primarily based on end-of-month assets. This explains why before 2018 there was usually a
sharp spike in the gap between IOER and the fed funds rate on the last day of a month; this was
the one day those banks didn’t want to borrow fed funds.
One can think about the determination of the fed funds rate in this setting as in Figure 9.
Banks differ in their marginal nonpecuniary costs of borrowing fed funds and would be willing
to borrow more the bigger the gap between IOER and fed funds. The apparent deterministic
nature of the IOER-fed funds gap in early 2017 arose from the fact that, on days other than the
last day of the month, and over the range of volume traded at that time, there was a sufficient
volume of borrowers with fixed nonpecuniary costs of 9 basis points. In other words, the

7

demand curve was flat over that range resulting in essentially a constant gap between IOER and
the fed funds rate.
6. Reverse repo rate.
The true floor in the current operating system comes not from IOER but instead from a
different facility. The Fed offers to conduct reverse repurchase agreements with a broader group
of financial institutions that includes money market funds. These are essentially short-term loans
from the institution to the Fed at a policy-determined rate RR. Figure 10 compares RR with the
tri-party Treasury repo rate. In a typical tri-party repo transaction, a money market fund would
lend overnight to a primary security dealer (one of the large financial institutions authorized to
be a counterparty to transactions with the trading desk of the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York). The agreement is settled through one of the large clearing banks (Bank of New York
Mellon or JP Morgan Chase), with the security dealer temporarily delivering Treasury securities
to the clearing bank, essentially as collateral for the loan. Unlike the fed funds rate, the tri-party
repo rate is a true market rate that varies daily with market conditions. But RR puts a floor under
functions as a floor in a traditional corridor

the tri-party repo rate, for the same reason that

system. Why should a money-market fund loan to a private counterparty at the private repo rate
when it can earn RR risk free from the Fed?
7. Changes in 2018.
But while RR puts a floor under the tri-party repo rate, as seen in Figure 11, IOER does
not set a ceiling. Up until the end of 2017, the tri-party repo always traded in between RR and
IOER. This fact could give the impression that the system was functioning something like a
corridor system. But there’s nothing that prevented the private repo rate from going above
IOER, and indeed throughout 2018 it often did.

8

Figure 11 also plots another market-determined short-term interest rate, the Treasury
general collateralized finance rate (GCF). These are also repurchase agreements collateralized
with Treasury securities that are cleared through a third party, in this case the Fixed Income
Clearing Corporation1. A typical transaction here would be a loan from a primary security dealer
to a nonprimary security dealer, again collateralized by Treasuries, with the primary dealer often
rehypothecating the Treasury securities for purposes of its own borrowing through tri-party
repos. The GCF rate is generally above the tri-party repo rate. It’s interesting to compare the
2018 portion of Figure 11 with Figure 8. GCF started to trade consistently above IOER at the
same time that IOER stopped being the de facto ceiling on the fed funds rate.
What changed in 2018? The elimination of the gap between IOER and fed funds could
have come from either a rightward shift of the demand curve in Figure 9—the nonpecuniary
costs of borrowing fed funds decreased, leading borrowing banks bid up the cost of fed funds—
or from a leftward shift of the supply curve—FHLB are less willing to lend fed funds. If the first
explanation was correct, we would expect to see an increase in the volume of fed funds lending,
whereas if the second, we would expect to see a decrease. Figure 12 plots the effective fed funds
rate together with the volume of borrowing. It shows that the disappearing gap between IOER
and fed funds coincided with a decreased volume of fed lending, favoring the second explanation
based on the supply side. Figure 13 plots selected assets held by the FHLB. It paints a picture of
the FHLB turning from lending fed funds to alternative ways of investing short-term funds that
presumably provide a higher yield.
8. Perspectives on the current and potential future operating systems.
I’ve described the current operating system as one with a floor but no ceiling. What then
is holding rates down? I think the answer is twofold. First, there has been weak demand for

9

investment both in the U.S. and around the world for some time. Second, there remains a huge
volume of reserves in the system. Figure 14 summarizes the implications of the Fed’s balance
sheet from the perspective of its liabilities. The large security purchases of Figure 1 were
primarily financed by an expansion of bank deposits with the Fed. Banks so far have been
willing to hold these reserves as a result of IOER. As the Fed’s balance sheet contracted (and as
demand for cash gradually climbed), excess reserves have slowly been coming down.
Another important development in 2018 was increasing demand for borrowed funds, in
part arising from an elevated level of borrowing by the U.S. Treasury to finance the federal
government budget deficit. This could be one of the factors that has driven GCF up in 2018 and
that pulled lending away from the fed funds market. As we look ahead, we should expect
demand for loans to continue to change. The Fed will want some more accurate policy tools to
respond to these changes.
One option would be to allow reserves to shrink until we are back in something like the
historical system in Figure 6. That system worked when fluctuations in the Treasury’s balance
with the Fed (which are a choice of the Treasury, not the Fed) were on the order of a few billion
dollars. But one sees in Figure 14 that fluctuations today are in the hundreds of billions. It’s
also far from clear how we would make a smooth transition from the current operating system to
something like Figure 6.
A more natural transition from the current system would begin by acknowledging that
something like the tri-party repo rate is currently a more relevant market measure than the fed
funds rate. The Fed could introduce an open repo facility from which the same institutions that
currently use the reverse repo facility could also use direct repos to borrow all the funds they
usually wanted at a chosen policy rate. This would establish a corridor system for controlling the

10

private repo rate. I specify “usually” here because it would not be necessary, or even desirable,
to fully smooth out the “window dressing” that one sees in the end-of-quarter spike in private
repos. The end-of-quarter spikes arise because some institutions do not want to acknowledge the
extent of their exposure to private counterparty repos in their publicly available statements,
which are only based on assets as of the last day of a quarter. There’s no compelling policy
reason why the Fed should accommodate that seasonal demand. Indeed, historically a specified
fed funds target was viewed as perfectly consistent with end-of-month spikes in the effective fed
funds rate above the target arising from such forces.
The drawback of such a system would be that it puts the Fed in the position of effectively
insuring a broader set of institutions than those over which it has regulatory authority. The
longer run goal should therefore be to return both the ceiling and the floor for the policy rate to
offers to lend or borrow from only regulated institutions. The Fed could initially implement a
repo corridor system with a broad range of counterparties at the same time that it continues to
reduce the volume of excess reserves. As we reach a level when banks are more actively
managing their reserve balances, the Fed could restrict access to both repo facilities to regulated
institutions. This could be a practical path toward the goal of replacing the discount window
with a stigma-free facility.
