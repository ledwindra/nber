    "abstract": "\n\nBeyond a handful of studies examining early-adopting states in the early 1990s, little is known about the causal e\ufb00ects of mandatory waiting periods for abortion. In this study we evaluate the e\ufb00ects of a Tennessee law enacted in 2015 that requires women to make an additional trip to abortion providers for state-directed counseling at least 48 hours before they can obtain an abortion. Our di\ufb00erence-in-di\ufb00erences and synthetic-control estimates indicate that the introduction of the mandatory waiting period caused a 48\u201373 percent increase in the share of abortions obtained during the second trimester. Our analysis examining overall abortion rates is less conclusive but suggests a reduction caused by the waiting period. Putting these estimates into context, our back-of-the-envelope calculations indicate that Tennessee\u2019s MWP increased the monetary costs of obtaining an abortion by as much as $929 for some women.\n\n",
