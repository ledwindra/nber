    "abstract": "\n\nThe paper uses newly available cross-section data to study wage determination in the United Kingdom in the 1980s. The results are contrasted with those from a comparable sample from the US from 1977-1988.\n1) Fear of unemployment substantially depresses pay in both countries.\n2) There is some evidence of a wage ratchet in the UK whereby rates of pay are more flexible upwards than downwards.\n3) The unemployment elasticity of pay averages -0.1 in the UK and apparently zero in the US.\n4) Wages are almost twice as flexible in non-union and small workplaces in the UK.\n\n",
