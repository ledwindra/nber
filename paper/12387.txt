ABSTRACT
We examine whether handedness is related to performance in the labor market and, in particular,
earnings. We find a significant wage effect for left-handed men with high levels of education. This
positive wage effect is strongest among those who have lower than average earnings relative to those
of similar high education. This effect is not found among women.

Does handedness matter? The literature addressing that simple question is
immense and provides mixed evidence regarding the relationship between handedness
and various measures such as health outcomes, accident rates, and cognitive skills.1
Numerous studies have shown that left-handed individuals have different health
outcomes. For example, some studies find they have a higher rate of high blood pressure
(Bryden, Bruyn, and Fletcher, 2005) and irritable bowel syndrome (Dancey et al, 2005)
but a lower rate of arthritis and ulcer (McManus and Wysocki, 2005). Meta-analyses did
not find convincing evidence that left-handedness was correlated with immune disorders
(Bryden, McManus, and Bulman-Fleming, 1994) but did find a positive correlation with
schizophrenia (Dragovic and Hammond, 2005).
Evidence as to the relationship between accident rates and handedness may be
even more mixed. Higher accident rates for the left-handed are found in some studies –
such as Coren (1989) and (at least for traffic accidents) Dutta and Mandal (2006) – but
not in others – such as Hicks et al (1993) and Pekkarinen, Salminch, and Järvelin (2003).
However, a recent meta-analysis supports the positive correlation between handedness
and accident rates (Dutta and Mandal, 2006b).
Turning to measures of cognitive skills, the evidence is complex. A meta-analysis
found a “small but reliable increase” of dyslexia among nonright-handed individuals
(Eglinton and Annett, 1994). Some studies have found average performance in high

school is lower for left-handed students (for example, Williams, 1987), while others the
contrary; Faurie, Vianey-Liaud, and Raymond (2006) find handedness to be positively
correlated with school performance and leadership skills for boys while the correlation
was negative for girls. Generally, studies seem to find differences in cognitive skills that
favor right-handed individuals (Hardyck and Petrinovich, 1977; Porac and Coren, 1981)
but averages (central tendencies of the distribution) can be deceiving. Benbow (1986)
found that gifted youth were more than twice as likely to be left-handed than those in a
control group. Geschwind and Galaburda (1987, p. 98) concluded that “non-righthanded
populations are over-represented in all populations with high talent” (see also McManus
and Bryden, 1991).
It has also been argued that differences may lie not in cognitive abilities but rather
cognitive styles. Coren (1995) estimates the relationship between handedness and two
styles of thinking that he refers to as convergent (“a fairly focused application of existing
knowledge and rules to the task of isolating a single correct answer”) and divergent
(“moves outward from conventional knowledge into unexplored association”). Divergent
thinking is shown to be positively related to the degree of left-handedness, though only
for males.
In light of the previous findings, it is worth noting the relationship between
handedness and brain lateralization and anatomy. It is well-documented that lateralization
of speech is correlated with handedness. A review article reported that 95% of righthanders have speech lateralized in the left hemisphere, while this is the case with only
62% of left-handers (Hellige, 1990). In a meta-analysis, Driesen and Raz (1995) found
that the corpus callosum was larger in left-handers.

2

In this paper, we take a different approach to exploring whether handedness
matters by examining how people perform in the labor market. More specifically, is a
person’s handedness related to their earnings? If left-handedness is associated with
poorer health, higher accident rates, and lower average cognitive skills, it is natural to
expect that these result in lower labor productivity and thereby lower earnings. An
analysis of handedness and earnings can be interpreted as demonstrating whether these
factors affect, cumulatively and on net, a fairly universal measure of economic
performance.
There are additional reasons that handedness might be related to earnings. Lefthanded people may be less productive in those occupations which use tools, machines,
and systems that are designed for right-handers. Examples that have been noted include
electric food slicers, keyboards, drill presses, band saws, and roadways (Coren, 1993).
Secondly, it is possible that handedness and earnings are related through occupational
choice. Some studies have found disproportionately more left-handers among university
architecture students and faculty (Peterson and Lansky, 1974), university math students
and faculty (Annett and Kilshaw, 1982), artists (Mebert and Michel, 1980), and
musicians (Byrne, 1974). But again the evidence is mixed, which led one study to
report: “The results reported in the literature relating professional choice and handedness
are not consistent” (Cosenza and Mingoti, 1993, p.494). Our analysis will control for
occupational choice with rather coarse occupational classifications. A third possibility is
that there is discrimination against left-handed people when it comes to hiring,
promotion, and pay (Altonji and Blank, 1999). There is a history of discriminatory

3

attitudes towards those who are not right-handed (Coren, 1993) and, if present in the
labor market, ought to show up as lower earnings.
In the economics literature, there has been a large amount of work exploring how
years of education, experience in the labor market, race, gender, native ability, and family
background influence how much an individual earns (Weiss, 1986; Willis, 1986; Altonji
and Blank, 1999). In addition to these conventional characteristics, economic research
has examined the influence of health characteristics (Currie and Madrian, 1999), height
(Heineck, 2005), and even physical appearance (Biddle and Hamermesh, 1994). To this
literature, we add the individual trait of a person’s laterality – as measured by handedness
– which research in biology and psychology has established as a significant trait.
Our findings are quite contrary to expectations. We do not find any evidence that
left-handed individuals earn less, as might be suggested by the literature referred to above
which generally finds that left-handed people tend to suffer more from factors that would
reduce labor productivity. On the contrary, we find that left-handed individuals with
higher levels of education have higher earnings than right-handed-individuals. More
specifically, among the college-educated men in our sample, those who report being lefthanded earn 15 percent more than those who report being right-handed. The size of this
effect is economically and statistically significant. Interestingly, this wage differential is
found for males but not for females. We explore some possible explanations for these
findings but are not able to provide concrete evidence leading to a theory that can
reconcile all of the various facts we identify. We recommend this as an avenue for
future research.

I. Data and Model
Our data are taken from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY), a
nationally representative survey of approximately 5000 men and women used extensively
in economic research on earnings determination (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2003).
The sample consists of individuals who were of ages 14-21 in 1979 and were interviewed
annually for many years thereafter. In 1993, the year we use for analysis, they were age
28-35. We use only what is known as the "cross-section" sample, and we delete
oversamples of disadvantaged and minority groups.
The 1993 NLSY questionnaire included the following question:
Were you born naturally left-handed or right-handed?
(Interviewer: If neither, record explanation in comment screen.)

About 12 percent of the sample of men responded that they were left-handed as did 10
percent of women; these figures are close to estimates from other data. Nearly 3 percent
of the sample volunteered an answer of "ambidextrous" and a few reported an answer of
"neither." While these are interesting groups, there are too few observations for us to
analyze and hence we delete them from the analysis.2 However, these answers do
highlight the fact that the measure of handedness in this survey glosses over many of the
distinctions made in the literature between handedness in different activities and the
question of whether everyone can be uniquely assigned to only two possible handedness
classifications (right- or left-handed).

2

In unreported regressions, we investigated the inclusion of the “neither” and
“ambidextrous” respondents in addition to those that identified themselves as right- or
left-handed but obtained results little different from those reported below.
5

The survey obtained data on the individual's hourly wage rate, which is the most
common measure of earnings and will be our primary outcome variable as well.3
Educational attainment is measured as the number of years of post-kindergarten
schooling. For a measure of IQ, we use the Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT), a
test developed by the U.S. Department of Defense to test potential enlistees on their
arithmetic reasoning, word knowledge, paragraph comprehension, and numerical
operations (Center for Human Resource Research, 2002). The AFQT is the most
common measure of IQ used by economists and was collected from the NSLY
respondents. This scale is a relatively crude measure of IQ compared to more
sophisticated measures used by developmental psychologists, and no doubt leaves many
dimensions of IQ unmeasured. The survey also obtained information on hours of work
per week, age, gender, marital status, race, and whether of Hispanic origin.
Outliers on the outcome variable, hourly wages, were deleted in order to avoid
their distorting the analyses using ordinary least squares regression, which describe
relationships among means. For men, we removed those with wages greater than
$80/hour or less than $0.45/hour, annual earnings greater than $100,000/year, or hours
worked per week greater than 120. For women the trimming removed those with wages
greater than $41/hour or less than $0.50/hour, or annual earnings greater than
$78,000/year. (These figures are all in 1993 dollars.) These extreme values are likely to
be the result of data errors, and resulted in only about 3 percent fewer observations for
men and 2 percent fewer women.

3

For those who are not actually paid by the hour, the NLSY data set follows the usual
practice of dividing earnings in the last paycheck by the number of hours worked in that
period to obtain an estimate of the implicit hourly wage rate.
6

Economists have devoted a great deal of study to the differences in earnings of
men and women, and have found that the earnings determination process is very different
for the two groups. This has led to the almost universal practice of considering the two
groups separately, estimating separating regressions for them, and conducting all
statistical tests separately (Altonji and Blank, 1999). This practice is followed here. We
will first concentrate on an analysis of men, and then report our analysis of women and
discuss how the results differ.
The means of the variables used in the analysis of men are listed in Table 1.
There are very few significant differences in labor market variables and demographic
characteristics by handedness. Most notably, there is no significant difference in hourly
wages between left-handers and right-handers, which is our first simple finding. We also
report the means for the logarithm of wages, which will be our dependent variable in the
regressions, as the economic literature invariably finds this to be the better fitting
variable. There is no significant difference for that transformation of the wage as well. It
does appear that left-handers work slightly fewer hours than right-handers, however.
We also see no significant differences in years of education, AFQT scores, or the percent
that are married, Black, or Hispanic.

[TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE]

The raw mean difference between left-handers and right-handers in hourly wages
does not control for differences in other variables such as age, education, and race,
although the fact that these variables are not highly correlated with handedness suggests

7

that controlling for them may not make much difference. Nevertheless, the standard tool
for eliminating the influence of these confounding variables is linear regression analysis,
using ordinary least squares. We estimate regressions of the following form, where
lwage is the logarithm of the hourly wage rate, left is a dummy variable equal to 1 if the
individual is left-handed and 0 if the individual is right-handed, xdem is a column vector of
demographic variables (education, age, race, marital status, Black, Hispanic), and ε is a
regression error term. We will also test for interactions between left and these
demographics by entering variables for the product of left and demographic variables
( x dem ⋅ left ).

′ ⋅ β dem + (x dem ⋅ left )′ ⋅ β inter + ε
lwage = β 0 + β L ⋅ left + x dem

(1)

The coefficient β L estimates the effect on the log wage of being left-handed instead of
right-handed, holding other characteristics fixed. Since the dependent variable is
measured in logarithms, the coefficient will have a percent interpretation; for example, if
the coefficient equals +0.10, this implies that left-handers have 10% greater hourly wage
rates than right-handers. The coefficient vector β dem will estimate the corresponding
effects of demographic variables on the log wage. The coefficients β inter on the
interaction variables allow us to determine whether the effect of being left-handed differs
for those with different values of the demographic variables. For example, if the
regression contains education as well as left*education, then the coefficient on education
will measure the effect of education on the log wage for right-handers, while the
coefficient on the interaction variable left*education will measure the difference between

8

the effect of education on earnings for left-handers and right-handers. If the interaction
coefficient is positive, this implies that the log wage differential between being lefthanded and being right-handed is greater for those with higher levels of education.
Interaction variables are an easy way to test for subgroup differences, although another
way to test for those differences is simply to run a separate regression for different
demographic groups (for example, high and low education groups); we use the latter
method as well in some cases.

II. Empirical Results
Table 2 reports the results of our first set of regressions for men. Column (1)
shows a regression for the log hourly wage containing a variable for left-handers and
controlling for the demographic characteristics, but without any interactions. The
coefficient on the left-handed variable is positive and implies a 4.5 percent advantage in
hourly wages of left-handers over right-handers, but it is statistically insignificantly
different from zero at the 10 percent level of confidence. Thus, we find that the
insignificant raw difference we found in Table 1 persists after we control for
demographic characteristics.4

[TABLE 2 ABOUT HERE]

4

We estimated similar regressions but replacing the dependent variable with hours of
work per week, employment status, and the logarithm of annual earnings. The
handedness variable was statistically insignificant in those regressions as well.
9

The other coefficients show that the log wage is positively affected by AFQT,
education, age, and being married, and is negatively affected by being Black or Hispanic
(relative to White).5 These coefficient signs are the same as those widely found in the
economics literature. The coefficient on education, for example, implies that a one-year
increase in education leads to a 5.0 percent increase in the hourly wage. In the
economics literature, the coefficient on education in a log wage regression is generally
called the economic "return" to education, because education is generally seen as an
investment in future earning power and the term "return" is borrowed from the literature
on investing in financial assets.
The second column in the table shows tests for whether the handedness difference
is significant in any demographic subgroup by adding interaction variables to the
regression. As the results show, there is no significant difference in the log wage of lefthanders and right-handers of different ages, marital status, race, AFQT, or ethnic status.
However, we do find a significant difference by education, with the interaction
coefficient (on left*education) of 0.035, implying that left-handers have a 3.5 percent
greater return to a year of education than right-handers, whose return to a year of
education is 4.6 percent; hence left-handers have a return of education of 8.1 percent (=
3.5 + 4.6). We therefore pursue this education difference in detail.

5

We do not include the square of age, as most economic models do, because our men are
relatively young in age and thus their wages have not yet started to exhibit much
curvature.
10

A. Handedness and Higher Education
A standard finding in the economics literature on education is that the effect of
education on wages and earnings is nonlinear, in that most effects occur at educational
transition points such as high school and college graduation. A common regression
specification then allows the education effect to be separated for those with less than 12
years of education, those with exactly 12 years of education (i.e., a high school degree),
those with some college (at least 13 years of completed education), and those with a
college degree or more (16 or more years of education). Partitioning the data into these
educational categories, let us first return to examining the raw data in order to assess
where the log wage differences associated with handedness are occurring.
Table 3 shows mean log hourly wages for the two handedness groups using these
categorizations of education. There are no significant differences for those with 12 or
fewer years of education, but the differences are significant for those with 13 or more
years; the table shows an 11 percent greater hourly wage for left-handers for this group.
The difference remains significant and is larger (14 percent) when we examine only those
with 16 or more years of education. Hence we conclude that the significant education
difference we found in Table 2 is mainly occurring among those who have gone on to
higher education; no differences appear for the less educated men.

[TABLE 3 ABOUT HERE]

We pursue this finding with regression analysis by estimating separate regressions
for those men with 13 or more years of education, and those with 16 or more years of

11

education, including the same set of demographic control variables we used in the first
column of Table 2. These results are reported in Table 4. For the group with 13 years or
more education, the coefficient on the left-handed variable is 0.039 and statistically
insignificant, indicating that the hourly wage differences between left-handed and righthanded individuals in this group can be accounted for by the control variables. The
interaction term in Column (3) indicates that the difference occurs only in the group with
16 or more years of education: of men entering college, those that are left-handed have a
return to completing a college education that is 16.4 percentage points higher than the
23.4 percent return received by those that are right-handed. Focusing solely on the group
with 16 years or more education in Column (4), the coefficient indicates again that there
are large hourly wage differences between the two handedness groups for those who have
completed college—the left-handed have 15.5 percent greater hourly wages—even after
controlling for other demographic differences (listed in the table’s notes).

[TABLE 4 ABOUT HERE]

B. College Major and Occupation
Previous studies mentioned in the Introduction have found a relationship between
handedness and occupational choice or career choice (as reflected in college major). It is
then possible that the wage differential experienced by college-educated left-handers may
reflect the choice of, or aptitude for, higher-paying jobs rather than higher productivity.
We now explore that possibility.

12

Although the NLSY does not contain a variable that summarizes college major,
we used the available variables to generate indicators of types of degree (associate,
bachelor, master and other) and classification of most recent undergraduate major. Three
larger super-categories were also created by combining “Sciences” with “Engineering”
and combining “Social Sciences” and “Humanities” with “General”, leaving “Business
and Management” on its own. Specific majors for which the handedness literature
contends that left-handed individuals may have proclivities are “Fine and Applied Arts,”
“Mathematics,” and “Architecture and Environmental Design.” Unfortunately, only
about one fifth of the respondents could be said to have reported a most recent
undergraduate major. Among those who responded, however, neither the targeted
definition of majors for which we would expect a bias towards left-handedness, nor any
of the other categories or super-categories of most recent undergraduate major showed
significant correlation with handedness (as measured by the Pearson correlation
coefficient). However, these majors are broad in definition and are only loosely
correlated with earnings, let alone handedness.
The NLSY questionnaire also asked respondents for their occupation of work.
However, our sample size is not large enough to study more than broad occupation
categories: professionals, managers, sales workers, clerical workers, craft workers,
operatives, service workers, and laborers. The data show that there is a slight tendency
for more left-handers to be found in the skilled occupations, but the differences are not
large. Recalling from Table 1 that the representation of left-handedness in the 1993 male
population (and our sample) is about 12%, we draw the following comparisons with
individual occupations. In our sample, 11 percent of professionals are left-handed, but 14

13

percent of managers are left-handed. Less than 10 percent of operatives, service
workers, and laborers are left-handed, in contrast. There is then a weak relationship in
the expected direction. However, left-handed men are 14 percent of craft workers and 15
percent of clerical workers as well. These occupations are in the middle of the skill
distribution. Thus we find a slight positive correlation between occupational skills and
left-handedness but one that is not monotonic.
We also analyze the effect of occupation on hourly wages by including dummy
variables for each of the occupation groups, omitting one (professionals) and interacting
our left-handed dummy variable with these occupation dummy variables. As shown in
Table 5, the interaction coefficients between left and occupation are generally statistically
insignificant. The one exception is for the category of laborer, where a positive and
significant coefficient appears in the one specification in which our left variable is
interacted with other variables in the equation, implying that the increased wages
received by professionals as compared to laborers are significantly different between
those that are left- and right-handed. In fact, this leads left-handed laborers to actually
earn more than left-handed professionals. In other occupations it is merely a flattening:
the advantage of being a professional, as compared to other occupations, is mitigated by
being left-handed. (The other occupational interactions in the third column, while not
statistically significant at conventional levels, are positive.)
The size and statistical significance of the coefficients on the interactions between
left-handedness and education (left*educ13-15 and left*educ16+) in the final column
show that occupation (laborer) certainly does not explain the greater returns to education
realized by left-handed men we found previously. We still estimate a 15.9 percentage

14

point larger increase in wages for left- than right-handed men for completing some
college, and a 26 percentage point larger increase for completing college (in both cases
compared to completing no college).
That occupational effects on wages are not more generally significant may be a
result of the coarseness of the occupation classifications. In particular, one might have
expected that there would be a positive wage effect for left-handers for the two highestskilled occupations - professionals and managers – given the previous finding of a higher
return to education for those that are left-handed. However, there is great heterogeneity in
the nature of the intellectual work required within these categories. More surprising is the
positive wage differential for the unskilled category of laborer which is a puzzle in light
of our earlier results. There might be several forces at work here, as we discuss further
after investigating differences in the return to education at different points in the
distribution of returns. We will also discuss a potential link between occupational
differences and the returns to education.

[TABLE 5 ABOUT HERE]

C. Changes in the Distribution of the Returns to Education

As mentioned above, the differential return to higher education for the left-handed
persists even after controlling for our admittedly coarse measures of college major and
occupation. To dig deeper into where this differential return is arising in the wage

15

distribution, we will use quantile regression (Koenker and Bassett, 1978; Buchinsky,
1998; Koenker and Hallock, 2001).
This technique allows the measurement of differences in wages for different
education and handedness groups at different points in the overall wage distribution of
the population, e.g., those at the 90th percentile or 10th percentile, holding constant other
demographic characteristics in the usual regression framework. Individuals at the 90th
percentile are those who have very high earnings and individuals at the 10th percentile are
those who have very low earnings relative to all others in the population, again holding
constant other characteristics. Another way of saying that we are holding other
characteristics (demographics and AFQT score) constant is to refer to the “conditional
distribution” of wages—conditional, that is, on the other measured characteristics. This
parallels discussions of the mean in ordinary least squares results.
Our preceding results on education and handedness have told us that, on average
over the conditional wage distribution, those with higher education who are left-handed
do particularly well. With quantile regression, we can examine whether these
advantages are the same for those who end up in the top or bottom of the conditional
wage distribution. We can therefore examine education and handedness differences at
different strata of the wage distribution, rather than simply changes in the mean as
modeled by ordinary least squares regression.
Table 6 reports the coefficients from the quantile regressions showing how the
return to 16 or more years of education differs for left- and right-handed subjects who are
at different percentile points of the hourly wage distribution, conditional on the other
variables included in these quantile regressions. (For purposes of brevity, we do not

16

report the other coefficients.) The second row shows that right-handed individuals have
monotonically increasing returns to a college education as one moves from lower to
higher percentiles in the wage distribution; the return ranges from 19 percent at the 10th
percentile up to 41 percent at the 90th percentile. This finding for right-handers is
consistent with previous studies that did not control for handedness (such as Buchinsky,
1994), which is not surprising since presumably around 90 percent of such population
samples are right-handed. Economists typically interpret these types of differences as
reflecting unobserved differences in "ability" or, more precisely, a complementarity
between ability and education (Arias, Hallock, and Sosa-Escudero, 2002; Mwabu and
Schultz, 1996). We are controlling for an observed measure of ability, the AFQT score,
but we know that it is only a crude proxy for dimensions of ability that are related to
labor market performance.

[TABLE 6 ABOUT HERE]

In contrast, the first row of Table 6 shows that the return to a college education
for a left-handed individual is fairly constant over the wage distribution, ranging from
46.2 percent to 50.7 percent. The third row of the table reports the difference between
these two coefficients and shows the greater educational benefit to left-handers in the
lower half of the wage distribution. The gain we found earlier - a 15.5 percent higher
return to 16 or more years of education for left-handers - is not occurring uniformly over
the wage distribution but rather is considerably higher than 15.5 percent at the lower

17

percentiles and lower than 15.5 percent at the upper percentiles. In fact, the difference is
not significantly different from zero at the 75th and 90th percentiles. In our discussion
below we consider reasons why we might not observe a complementarity between
education and unobserved ability among left-handed men.

D. Gender
After completing the analysis of male subjects in the data, the exact same
sequence of analyses was conducted for the female sub-sample. The results showed no
significant differences between left-handed and right-handed females in any dimension,
including those where significant differences were found for males. Among females,
left-handers had no differences in hourly wages even among those with 16 or more years
of education, and there were no significant differences in wages at any point in the
distribution of wages for any education group. Some speculation on possible reasons for
this result is provided in the next section.

III. Discussion
Our analysis has revealed four findings, presented in order of robustness rather
than in the order of their exposition above. First, left-handed individuals earn a higher
wage than right-handed individuals but only among the college-educated. Second, this
positive wage effect is strongest in the lower half of the wage distribution because the
return to college education is constant for left-handers throughout the conditional wage
distribution but for right-handers the return is greater at higher conditional wage

18

percentiles. Third, we have a weak result that left-handed laborers earn a higher wage
than right-handed laborers. Fourth, the previous effects apply only to men.
We do not have a theory that reconciles all of these findings. On one level, that is
not surprising since the preceding literature on handedness shows that its correlates and
effects are multi-dimensional, often subtle, and often poorly measured by the available
data. Our goal here is to suggest some possible explanations for the results and to relate
these findings to previous work. Future work can explore these results further,
presumably with data that better targets the links between biology, educational choices,
occupational choices, and labor market outcomes.
One explanation for the first two findings has to do with differential ability for
left-handed individuals and occupational choice. Focusing upon higher-educated people,
suppose there are two unobservable traits: general ability and a taste for (or ability for)
jobs which require high levels of education but which do not pay well (examples will be
provided momentarily). Next suppose that left-handed individuals have high levels of
both traits relative to right-handers. The first trait (general ability) drives up their return
to education while the second one drives down the level of their wage and also puts them
in the lower part of the conditional wage distribution. The net result is that it appears that
the return to higher education does not go up with the level of (unobserved) ability, but in
fact it would if we were holding the second unobservable trait constant (which we are
not). As we noted previously, our measured variable for ability is unlikely to adequately
capture the first trait. Our measures of an interest and aptitude in jobs that require high
levels of education but provide relatively low pay (the second trait) are also relatively
inexact.

19

As evidence consistent with our explanation, past studies mentioned in the
Introduction have documented that left-handed individuals are disproportionately
represented among artists, musicians, and university faculty, at least in some disciplines.
Artists and musicians are occupations in which the individual typically has a high level of
education but relatively low earnings. University faculty also have lower salaries than
those with comparable education who have taken jobs in business, industry, or
government. These types of jobs are personally but not financially highly rewarding.
Furthermore, it was also noted in the Introduction that studies have found that left-handed
individuals are disproportionately represented in the upper tail of the distribution on
measures of cognitive skills, which is consistent with higher ability of left-handers among
the most educated.
Following up on this tentative explanation, we have also explored how occupation
varies with handedness for those in the lower percentiles of the wage distribution with 16
or more years of education. Though our sample sizes are not large enough to break down
occupation distributions within small ranges of the wage distribution for college-educated
left-handed men, we are able to obtain acceptable sample sizes by examining those in the
lower 25th percent of the conditional distribution.6 The results (not shown in a table)
show that left-handed men are more concentrated in the higher-skilled occupations within
this subpopulation. For example, 53 percent of those who are left-handed are in

6

For this discussion, we took our estimates of the wage regression at the 25th percentile
point (see footnote to Table 5 for the variables in the equation), predicted the 25th
percentile point for each individual, and selected those individuals with 16 years of
education whose actual wages were below that predicted value for the 25th percentile.
We then tabulated the occupational distributions of left-handed and right-handed
individuals within this group.
20

professional occupations, compared to 38 percent of those who are right-handed.7 We
calculated a chi-squared statistic of 22.7 for the difference in the occupational distribution
of the left-handed group as compared to the right-handed group, which is larger than the
critical value for 95% confidence, 12.6. These findings are, therefore, consistent with the
argument we have put forth, although what is really needed is a larger data set with finer
or more targeted occupational categories.
The finding of a positive wage for laborers is difficult to reconcile with these
other explanations because that occupation is neither high in education nor high in nonfinancial, personal rewards. However, an inspection of the coefficients in the relevant
regression reveals that left-handed individuals in all non-professional occupations earn
more than professionals, contrary to right-handed individuals for whom the expected
ascending wage profile with occupational skill occurs. For example, while left-handed
laborers earn 20 percent more than left-handed professionals, left-handed managers, sales
workers, and craft workers earn 17 percent more, almost the same amount. Indeed, the
wages of laborers are usually not statistically different than those of other nonprofessional occupations among left-handed individuals. The relatively flat profile of
wages by occupation exhibited in the data is quite similar to the flat profile of wages by
percentile point in the distribution, and may likewise reflect the low pay of professionals
more than any other factor, for which we have given an explanation above. More
research is needed using data with greater numbers of observations on detailed
occupation to address this finding.
7

The other two groups that had significantly large standard errors in the calculation of
the chi-squared statistic were clerical workers and operators. Both are lower-skilled
occupations, and both had fewer left-handed individuals than the right-handed
distribution would predict.
21

The final issue is why none of these effects are observed for women. We
hypothesize several possible reasons for this difference. One is that the female
occupational distribution was, in 1993 (and is still today), quite different from that of
males. Women are in more clerical and service positions, while men are found more in
craftsman, operative, and non-farm labor jobs. Also, 11% of women in our sample are
managers compared to 17% of men, but population figures show that professional women
are heavily concentrated in “education, training, and library occupations” and have a
weaker representation in the category “computer specialists, engineering, math and
architecture,” the groups for whom we hypothesis left-handed individuals have an
advantage (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2003). These occupational differences have been
extensively discussed in the literature on gender differences in the labor market and are
thought to arise from a number of sources, including possible gender discrimination.
Gender discrimination may, more generally, provide an additional explanation for
our findings for women. The same forces described for higher-educated left-handed
males may be at work with higher-educated left-handed females but discrimination
against women for those types of positions may be counteracting it so that no wage effect
is found. Consistent with these points is that women are typically underrepresented
among artists, musicians, and university faculty, which are three of the occupations
identified as requiring high levels of education but that pay low or modest wages, and
where we have speculated that some of the greatest relative earnings gains among lefthanded men occur.
Finally, recall the study by Coren (1995) mentioned in the Introduction that found
“divergent thinking” more common among left-handed people though only for males. If

22

it is this differential cognitive style that is the source of the higher earnings for collegeeducated left-handed men, it would explain why it is not observed for women.

III. Concluding Remarks
Building on the very large literature studying laterality in biology and psychology,
this study is the first to explore whether handedness correlates with measures of
economic performance. Handedness is correlated with the financial return to education in
that left-handed college-educated people earn 15 percent more than right-handed college
educated people. This wage differential is found for males but not for females.
Clearly, more research using different data sets is required to determine whether
our findings are robust. It is especially important to better control for how occupational
choice varies with handedness. In spite of the limitations of our data set in that regard, we
do find several suggestive and economically and statistically significant results that
suggest further support for the notion that handedness matters.
