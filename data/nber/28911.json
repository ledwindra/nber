    "abstract": "\n\nWe present the proof-of-concept for minimalist market design (S\u00f6nmez, 2023) as an effective methodology to enhance an institution based on the desiderata of stakeholders with minimal interference. Four objectives \u2013 respecting merit, increasing retention, aligning talent, and enhancing trust \u2013 guided reforms to US Army\u2019s centralized branching process of cadets to military specialties since 2006. USMA\u2019s mechanism for the Class of 2020 exacerbated challenges implementing these objectives. Formulating the Army\u2019s desiderata as rigorous axioms, we analyze their implications. Under our minimalist approach to institution redesign, the Army\u2019s objectives uniquely identify a branching mechanism. Our design is now adopted at USMA and ROTC.\n\n",
