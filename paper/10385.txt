Legislative Representation, Bargaining Power, and the Distribution of Federal Funds:
Evidence from the U.S. Senate

NBER Working Paper No. 10385
March 2004
JEL No. D7, H7
ABSTRACT
While representation in the U.S. House is based upon state population, each state has an equal
number (two) of U.S. Senators. Thus, relative to the state delegations in the U.S. House, small
population states are provided disproportionate bargaining power in the U.S. Senate. This paper
provides new evidence on the role of this small state bargaining power in the distribution of federal
funds using data on projects earmarked in appropriations bills between 1995 and 2003. Relative to
earmarks secured in House appropriations bills, Senate earmarks exhibit a small state advantage that
is both economically and statistically significant. The paper also examines two theoreticallymotivated channels through which this small state advantage operates: increased proposal power
through appropriations committee representation and the lower cost of securing votes due to smaller
federal tax shares. Taken together, these two channels explain over 80 percent of the measured small
state bias. Finally, a welfare analysis demonstrates the inefficiency of hte measured small state bias.

Introduction

In the U.S. Senate, each state has two delegates regardless of state population, providing small
population states with disproportionate representation on a per-capita basis.1 Wyoming, the
state with the smallest population, currently has over 70 times the per-capita representation of
California, the state with the largest population. This divergence is expected to become only
more severe in the coming years; according to projections by the Census Bureau, three of the
largest states by current population measures (California, Texas, and Florida) are also expected
to be among the fastest growing states. While Senate delegations are fixed, delegation sizes
in the U.S. House, by contrast, are much more closely aligned with state population and are
adjusted every ten years to reflect changes in population across states.
Many have hypothesized that this disproportionate political power for small states in the
U.S. Senate should translate into higher levels of federal spending being located in these states.
More specifically, researchers have investigated a possible link between per-capita federal spending and per-capita representation in the U.S. Senate.

While both Atlas et. al. (1995) and

Lee (1998) report statistically significant relationships, the magnitude of these relationships are
relatively weak from an economic perspective.
This paper provides several contributions to this existing literature. First, unlike the existing literature, the hypothesized relationship between representation and the distribution of
federal funds is formally derived from a theoretical legislative bargaining model modified to
allow for variable delegation sizes. Due to the common pool tax base, which provides incentives for agenda-setters to minimize coalition sizes, and the disproportionate political power
aﬀorded small states in the U.S. Senate, the theoretical model predicts a bargaining advantage
for small states, defined as a positive relationship between delegates per-capita and federal
spending per-capita.

In addition, this model provides a theoretical foundation for the per-

capita normalizations that have been employed in the existing literature.

The model also

identifies two channels underlying this small-state bargaining advantage: after adjusting for
1

Of course, other central legislatures, such as those of Brazil and the European Union, also provide small

jurisdictions with representation disproportionate to their populations.

2

population diﬀerences, small states are both more likely to be represented on relevant Congressional committees (the proposal-power channel) and are more attractive coalition partners due
to their lower federal tax liabilities (the vote-yield channel). Given that measures of these two
underlying channels are readily available, one can empirically gauge the relative contribution of
these two factors to a small-state bargaining advantage in the U.S. Senate. Finally, a welfare
analysis examines the eﬃciency properties of the observed small state bias.
In addition to these theoretically-based contributions, the project-based data on the crossstate allocation of federal funds are richer than those used in previous studies and thus aﬀord
several empirical contributions. First, previous studies have tended to use highly aggregated
data that include federal spending programs, such as Social Security, that are diﬃcult for Congressional delegations to geographically manipulate. The projects studied here were earmarked
in Congressional appropriations bills and were thus more easily manipulated by delegations,
providing more accurate estimates of small state bias in the U.S. Senate. While these types
of projects seem a reasonable focus in a test for the eﬀects of Senate representation, it is important to note that the results in this paper can be generalized to only the subset of federal
spending programs for which Congress has significant influence over the geographic allocation.
Regarding the second empirical contribution, the data identify a sponsoring chamber (House
or Senate), allowing for more accurate estimates of the small-state bias in the U.S. Senate
as well as a means for controlling for unobserved state characteristics. Using this previously
untapped data source, the preliminary results demonstrate relationships between per-capita
federal spending and per-capita Senate representation that are much stronger than those found
using the data and methods in the existing literature.
This paper also provides a justification, at least in part, for recent worldwide movements
towards decentralization of the public sector.

If political factors, rather than economic fun-

damentals, determine the geographic allocation of public goods under centralized provision,
public goods may be over-provided in politically powerful states (small states in this instance)
and under-provided in politically weak states. Thus, the centralized provision of local public
goods may entail ineﬃciencies. Under decentralized provision, by contrast, states are forced to

3

fully internalize tax costs associated with spending in their jurisdictions and thus more appropriately weigh the economic costs and benefits of spending on public goods.2 Of course, this
advantage of decentralization must be balanced against any disadvantages of decentralization,
such as possible ineﬃciencies resulting from cross-state externalities.

Related Literature

Atlas et. al. (1995) report a statistically significant relationship between per-capita representation in the U.S. Senate and per-capita federal spending in an econometric analysis of aggregate
federal spending, as reported in Census data, between 1972 and 1990.

This result is robust

across several spending categories, including defense and entitlements. Unfortunately, the article does not provide summary statistics for the key empirical measures and thus one cannot
gauge the economic significance of these results. To address this limitation, I will conduct an
analysis using similar data and methods in order to compare their results with my results.
Lee (1998) tests for a small state advantage using data from the U.S. Domestic Assistance
Programs Database, as compiled by Bickers and Stein (1991).

These data contain federal

spending by Congressional districts, although the author aggregates up to the state level in order
to focus on diﬀerences in per-capita Senate representation. While the study finds statistically
significant evidence of a small state bias, the economic relationship between redistributive
spending and Senate representation is fairly weak, as I calculate the elasticity (evaluated at
sample means) to be less than 0.01. In an analysis of 12 functional policy areas, six provide
evidence of a statistically significant relationship and the implied elasticities are again small,
ranging from -0.05 to 0.10.
Two additional papers have examined the eﬀect of representation in other legislative settings. Rodden (2001) finds a connection between votes per-capita and net transfers per-capita
in the European Union. Ansolabehere, Gerber, and Snyder (2000) find that Baker v. Carr,
which forced state legislatures to switch from unit representation, as found in the U.S. Senate,

to population-based representation, significantly altered the flow of state transfers to county
governments. The authors calculate that, as a result of this ruling, approximately $7 billion
were diverted annually from formerly over-represented counties to formerly under-represented
counties.

3.1

Theoretical framework
Economic environment

Consider a collection of S states with a total national population equal to N . In a given state
(s), each of Ns residents is assumed to have quasilinear preferences over consumption of a local
public good (Gs ) and consumption of a private good (zs ):

U (gs , zs ) = h(Gs /Nsγ ) + zs

(1)

Preferences over public goods [h(Gs /Nsγ )] are assumed to be increasing and concave and are
normalized such that zero utility is obtained from zero spending [h(0) = 0]. The congestion
parameter [γ ∈ [0, 1]] captures the degree of rivalry in consumption; this specification nests the
case of private goods (γ = 1) as well as the case of pure public goods (γ = 0). Each resident in
state s is endowed with ms units of the private good, which can be converted into public goods
at a dollar-for-dollar rate.

3.2

Political environment

A central legislature determines the distribution of local public goods from a fixed budget (G).
In the legislature, each state has a delegation of size Vs , and the total number of delegates
P
(V ) is given by V = s Vs . Public goods are financed from a national, or common pool,

tax base, and, for simplicity, per-capita federal tax prices are assumed to be equal across the
federation (ps = 1/N ); the more general case of cross-state heterogeneity in federal tax prices
will be examined in the empirical section. Finally, private consumption is determined residually

5

(zs = ms − ps G).
The political process is modeled as a version of the legislative bargaining model due to
Baron and Ferejohn (1987 and 1989) and Persson and Tabellini (2002). In the first stage, a
single delegate is chosen, each with equal probability 1/V , to be the agenda-setter.

Denote

the home state of the agenda setter as s = a. This agenda-setter then proposes a geographic
P
distribution of the federal budget, subject to a balanced budget condition ( s Gs ≤ G). In the

second stage, each delegate votes over whether to accept or reject the proposed budget. If the
proposal receives a majority of votes from delegates in support, it is implemented; otherwise,

a reversion distribution of zero spending is implemented. This assumption of a zero reversion
budget is stronger than is required but is made to simplify the analysis; in addition, this
assumption seems reasonable in the empirical analysis of spending on new projects, for which
a zero reversion seems natural.

3.3

Equilibrium

Working backwards, and using the assumption that zero spending provides zero utility [h(0) =
0], each delegate will support proposals for which the total benefits accruing to a representative
constituent exceed the associated tax costs:

h(Gs /Nsγ ) ≥ ps G = G/N

(2)

Given that, within a state, delegates use equivalent voting rules, the minimum total cost (Cs )
and per-capita cost (cs = Cs /Ns ) to the proposer, expressed as a fraction of the total budget,
of securing votes from all of the delegates of state s can be expressed as follows:

Cs = βNsγ

(3)

cs = βNsγ−1

(4)

6

where β = h−1 (G/N )/G. In forming a majority coalition (Ma ), the agenda-setter, taking
voting rules as given, has an incentive to select as partners delegates from those states with the
highest vote yield, which is defined as the ratio of delegation sizes to the total cost of securing
all of the votes from a given delegation:
Vs
Vs
=
Cs
βNsγ

(5)

As shown, vote yields are increasing in the number of delegates and are decreasing in population
so long as some congestion is present (γ > 0). Under the special case of perfectly congestible
public goods (γ = 1), vote yields are proportional to delegates per-capita, suggesting one
channel through which a small state bias, as typically measured in the empirical literature, in
the U.S. Senate may operate.
At the agenda setter’s optimal proposal, expected per-capita budget shares (gs = Gs /GNs )
can be summarized as follows:

E(gs ) =

P

βNkγ , and

1(s ∈ Mk ) indicates whether or not state s would be included in a coalition formed by an
agenda setter representing state k.
Given the empirical focus on the U.S. Senate, consider next the special case of equal delegation sizes (Vs = V /S); note that populations (Ns ) and thus delegates per-capita [vs = Vs /Ns ]
continue to vary across states. In the case of equal delegation sizes, each state has an equal
probability of being represented by the agenda setter, coalitions are nearly identical, and per-

7

capita payments can be summarized as follows:3
E(gs ) =

¢¤
£
¡
δVs
Vs
+ (1 − )βNsγ−1 1 Vs /Nsγ > median Vk /Nkγ
Ns V

(7)

where the median is taken across all states. Next, using the fact that Vs = V /S, Ns = V /Svs ,
and median(f (x)) = f (median(x)) if the function f is monotonic, per-capita federal spending
can be expressed solely as a function of delegates per-capita:

E(gs ) =

S −1
δvs
+(
)β(V /S)γ−1 vs1−γ 1 [vs > median (vk )]
V
S

(8)

As shown in equation 8, as well as in Figure 1, the model predicts that disproportionate representation by small states in the U.S. Senate confers a small-state bargaining advantage as
expected per-capita federal spending is strictly increasing in per-capita representation.

The

linear portion of the relationship reflects the increase in the probability of selection as the
agenda-setter given an increase in per-capita delegation sizes, while the jump reflects the guarantee of inclusion in the majority coalition as delegates per-capita moves beyond its median
value. Beyond the median value, the slope incorporates both the increased probability of selection as the agenda setter as well as the higher per-capita cost of obtaining a states’ votes (note
that cs = βNsγ−1 = β(V /S)γ−1 vs1−γ ). This figure demonstrates that the bargaining advantage
aﬀorded small states in the U.S. Senate can be decomposed into two underlying channels: a
proposal-power channel and a vote-cost channel.

The role of these two underlying channels

will be analyzed more completely towards the end of this paper.

3.4

Alternative Political Environment

This section considers the robustness of this theoretical prediction of the legislative bargaining model.
3

In particular, an alternative political process, namely the universalism model of

Coalitions are identical except that the inclusion of the state with median vote yields depends upon the

identity of the agenda-setter. The median state will be included/excluded if agenda setter’s state is below/above
the median. With a suﬃciently large number of states, the role of this one state will be small. For simplicity,
the expressions abstract from the role of this one state.

8

Weingast, Shepsle, and Johnsen (1981), is shown to also predict a small state bias.

In the

universalism model, the total budget size (G) is endogenous, and state delegations, acting independently, increase spending on the local public good until marginal benefits are equal to
marginal costs:

h0 (Gs /Nsγ )/Nsγ = 1/N

(9)

Solving this equation for Gs yields the following expression:

Gs = Nsγ f (Nsγ /N )

(10)

where f (x) = [h0 (x)]−1 . Note two key properties of this inverse function: f (x) > 0 and f 0 (x) =
1/h00 (f (x)) < 0. In order to demonstrate the small state bias predicted by the universalism
model, federal spending is next converted to a per-capita basis:

gs = Nsγ−1 f (Nsγ /N )/G

(11)

Next, using the fact that Ns = V /Svs , delegation demands can be written solely as a function
of delegates per-capita:

gs = (V /S)γ−1 vs1−γ f ((V /S)γ vs−γ /N )/G

(12)

Thus, this model also predicts a positive relationship between per-capita federal spending and
delegates per-capita; that is, ∂gs /∂vs > 0. Note that, in this model, which has no explicit political process, the small state bias result is driven purely by diﬀerences in population, as opposed
to diﬀerences in representation; in aggregate, small states have lower federal tax liabilities and
thus are more responsive to common pool incentives.

Data
Project Spending Data

9

In order to test for a small state bias in the U.S. Senate, I use data from several sources.
The main source of data on federal spending is provided by the Citizens Against Government
Waste (CAGW), a private, non-partisan, non-profit organization that, for several years, has
catalogued funds for projects that were earmarked in annual appropriations bills. The data
are currently available on CAGW’s website for fiscal years 1995-2003. For each of the 37,336
catalogued projects, data include 1) the state in which the project is to be located, 2) the dollar
amount appropriated, 3) relevant appropriations bill (Congress appropriates funds through 13
separate bills each fiscal year), and 4) the sponsoring chamber (i.e. the chamber, House or
Senate, responsible for the appropriation).
As shown in Table 1 and Figure 2, Congressional earmarks are an important component of
federal spending; the 9,362 projects listed in the fiscal year 2003 appropriations bills totaled $23
billion.

Moreover, as shown, these appropriations earmarks have increased over time, rising

from about $13 billion in fiscal year 1995.
For the purposes of the econometric analysis, I focus on the subset of projects for which the
relevant state is listed. To provide a sense of the types of projects funded, Table 2 lists the
largest projects, those with appropriations in excess of $60 million in 2003 dollars. As shown,
the three largest projects were all included in the Defense appropriations bill, were sponsored by
the Senate, and were located in Mississippi, a relatively small state and also the home state of
Sen. Trent Lott, who served as Senate Majority Leader during the period in which the projects
were funded. The remaining projects listed span a wide variety of states, appropriations bills,
and sponsoring chambers.
To provide a broader sense of spending categories, Table 3 and Figure 3 detail the number
of projects and total funding by appropriations bill over this time period. As shown, military
construction and transportation appropriations bills provided the most funding, followed by
VA/HUD, defense, and energy. The District of Columbia, foreign operations, legislative, and
Treasury provided, perhaps not surprisingly, the least project funding.
Table 4 and Figure 4 provide a breakdown of project spending by sponsoring chamber,
one of the key variables in the econometric analysis. As shown, Senate projects provided the

10

most funding, at $20 billion, followed by House projects, which funded just over $13 billion.
Conference committees added a smaller amount, and the CAGW did not classify an additional
$9 billion in project spending (presumably due to missing or ambiguous data).

4.2

Additional data sources

For comparability with the existing literature, which has tended to use highly aggregated data,
I also analyze data from the Consolidated Federal Funds Reports, an annual Census Bureau
publication on the cross-state allocation of federal outlays. Spending programs include retirement and disability, grants, procurement, salaries and wages, and other direct payments. For
comparability with the CAGW data, I use fiscal years 1995-2002; at the time of this writing,
data from fiscal year 2003 were unavailable. Unlike the CAGW data, the Census data provide
neither a sponsoring chamber nor a relevant appropriations bill.
In order to convert these measures of federal funding to a per-capita basis, as motivated
by equation 8 in the theoretical model, data on population by year from the Census Bureau
are incorporated into the analysis. Although the Census is only conducted every 10 years, the
Census Bureau provides annual estimates of population by state; populations are estimated as
of July 1 of the relevant year.

5

Measuring Small State Bias

Table 5 provides preliminary results of tests for the presence of a small-state bargaining advantage in the U.S. Senate.

For comparability with the existing literature, I first analyze

aggregated Census data and estimate the following simple linear equation relating per-capita
federal spending to per-capita representation:

SENAT E
HOU SE
gst = α + β 1 vst
+ β 2 vst
+ ust

(13)

where s indexes states, t indexes time, and ust represents unobserved determinants of the
geographic distribution of per-capita federal spending. As shown in column 1, an extra Senator

11

is associated with an extra 0.02 percentage point share of federal spending. While statistically
significant, this relationship is economically weak; the implied elasticity of federal spending
with respect to representation is just 0.05. The coeﬃcient associated with representatives percapita in the U.S. House is also statistically significant, and the regression has non-negligible
explanatory power, as the R-squared equals 0.1107.
There are several possible explanations for this economically weak relationship between
per-capita federal spending and the number of Senators per-capita. I address and attempt to
empirically account for three such explanations below. First, for institutional reasons, it may
be diﬃcult to geographically manipulate many types of federal spending in the Census data,
such as Social Security payments, veterans payments, Medicaid, and Medicare.

The second

column addresses this concern by focusing on CAGW projects, whose geography was more easily
manipulated by Congressional delegations. As shown, an extra Senator is associated with a
0.44 percentage point share of federal spending, and this relationship is statistically significant.
These results imply an elasticity of spending per-capita with respect to Senate representation of
0.54, a significantly stronger result than that using the Census data in column 1. As expected,
data on CAGW project spending, which, relative to other types of federal spending, is more
easily manipulated by Congressional delegations, provide stronger evidence for a small-state
bargaining advantage in the U.S. Senate. Relative to the Census data results, the R-squared
is somewhat higher using the CAGW data, and representatives per-capita in the U.S. House
does not have a statistically significant eﬀect.
Even with this data on highly manipulable project spending, it may prove diﬃcult to isolate
the eﬀect of Senate representation from other factors. In addition to the U.S. Senate, several
other political agents play a role in the geographic distribution of funds associated with federal
projects. The executive branch often proposes projects in its own budget documents and also
has veto power over appropriations bills. In addition, the U.S. House passes their own version
of appropriations bills; House and Senate versions are then reconciled in conference committees,
which are composed of members from both chambers. To better isolate the eﬀects of Senate
representation, I next focus on the subset of projects that were identified by the CAGW as

12

Senate-sponsored. While these projects would also have to be approved by the U.S. House and
signed into law by the President, such projects seem the source of funds most likely to reflect
diﬀerences in Senate representation. In this case, the estimated model is very similar to that
above, although representatives per-capita is excluded from the specification:

gst = α + β 1 vsSENAT E + ust

(14)

As shown in column 3, as well as in Figure 5, Senators per-capita again has a statistically
significant eﬀect and the implied elasticity is 0.95, up significantly from 0.54 in column 2.
By focusing solely on Senate-sponsored projects, the eﬀect of Senate representation on the
geographic distribution of federal funds becomes even more apparent.
The final innovation of this empirical analysis involves the role of unobserved state characteristics. States with high per-capita representation in the Senate are concentrated in the
Rocky Mountain states, such as Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota, and South Dakota. These
states are considered outliers across many dimensions; they tend, for example, to be more rural,
conservative, and agriculture-based. Without controlling for these unobserved characteristics,
any measured relationship, or lack thereof, between Senate representation and the distribution
of federal funds may reflect the role of these unobserved, correlated factors, rather than the role
of representation in the Senate itself. To address this omitted variable bias, column 4 includes
observations on both Senate-sponsored projects and House-sponsored projects, allowing for the
inclusion of state fixed eﬀects.4 The estimating equation in this instance is given as follows:

gstc = αs + β 1 vsct + ustc

(15)

where c indexes chambers and αs captures the state fixed eﬀects. In this case, identification
is driven by within-state variation in per-capita delegation sizes between the House and the
Senate.

As shown, after controlling for unobserved state factors, delegates per-capita has a

strong and statistically significant eﬀect on the distribution of per-capita federal spending, and
4

House delegation sizes are normalized to Senate delegation sizes; that is, House delegations are divided by

4.35.

13

the economic relationship becomes even stronger, as the implied elasticity rises to 1.04. Taken
together, the regression results in columns 2-4 provide strong evidence of a link between percapita delegation sizes and federal spending per-capita, thus providing strong support for the
existence of a small-state bargaining advantage in the U.S. Senate.
These results in column 4 rest upon an implicit assumption of strategic independence across
legislative chambers. Under this strategic independence assumption, the House and the Senate
independently develop an allocation of projects, which are then simply merged during the conference committee, which reconcile the House and Senate appropriations bills. Unfortunately,
I cannot directly test this implicit assumption as projects that were removed during the conference committee are excluded from the CAGW data. As an alternative to this direct test, I
conducted a case study of the fiscal year 2003 Military Construction appropriations bill. Based
upon an analysis of projects included in the initial House bill, the initial Senate bill, and the
final conference bill, over 80 percent of projects included in the House and Senate bills were
also included in the conference version. The large proportion of projects funded is consistent
with this implicit assumption of strategic independence across chambers. Note that, even if
the assumption of strategic interdependence were violated, the results in column 2, which were
based solely on the cross-state variation in project spending, would remain valid.

Underlying Channels and Welfare Analysis

I build upon this strong evidence of a small-state bargaining advantage in the U.S. Senate
with an analysis investigating two underlying channels, or sources, of a small-state bargaining
advantage as identified by the theoretical model: the proposal-power channel and the vote-yield
channel. In addition, this estimation approach permits an eﬃciency analysis of the observed
small state bias.

14

6.1

Econometric Model

In order to derive an empirical version of this model, one must specify a functional form for
utility from consuming public goods [h(Gs /Nsγ )]; for tractability purposes, consider a simple
Cobb-Douglas parameterization:

h(Gs /Nsγ )

=

µ

Gs
θξ s Nsγ

¶α

(16)

where the parameter α ∈ (0, 1) captures the diminishing marginal utility from consuming public
goods, θ > 0 captures common, or nationwide, preferences for private goods, relative to public
goods, and ξ s > 0 captures heterogeneity across states in preferences for private goods; this
heterogeneity is assumed to be observed by representatives in the legislature but not by the
econometrician.
For empirical purposes, we allow for cross-state variation in per-capita tax prices (ps ); the
previous analysis focused on the special case of homogenous tax prices (ps = 1/N ). Under this
specification, vote costs, per-capita vote costs, and vote yields are given as follows:

(19)

where e
θ = θG(1−α)/α . Next, in order to highlight the various channels, consider expected per-

capita federal payments (conditional on the identity of the agenda-setter) and the probability
of inclusion in the coalition:

Vote-cost channel

Pr(s ∈ M ) = Pr [ln(ξ s ) < ln(Vs ) − γ ln(Ns ) − (1/α) ln(ps ) − η]
15

(21)

where η, a constant, incorporates the delegates per-capita cutoﬀ level for inclusion in the
agenda-setter’s coalition. In equation 20, which is derived directly from the theoretical model,
per-capita federal spending is expressed as non-linear function of four exogenous, measurable
variables: 1) committee representation, 2) per-capita federal tax prices, 3) state populations,
and 4) delegation sizes.5
Measures of delegation sizes, which vary across states in the U.S. House, and population
are those used in the previous section. In order to construct a measure of federal tax prices
(ps ), I have obtained state-specific estimates of U.S. federal tax liabilities for the relevant
fiscal years from the Tax Foundation.6

For the agenda-setter variable, I use data regarding

membership on House and Senate Appropriations committees, which had significant control
over the appropriations process. Given that the CAGW data on project spending also include
the relevant appropriations bill, I have also constructed measures of membership on the 13
appropriations subcommittees, each of which has jurisdiction over an appropriations bill. With
13 appropriations subcommittees, 2 chambers (House or Senate), 9 years, and 50 states, the
total sample size is 11,700; after eliminating appropriations bills with zero or negligible spending,
the remaining sample size is 7,050.
For purposes of empirical implementation, the estimating equations 20 and 21 are further
modified in two ways. The first modification assumes a log-normal distribution for unobserved
preferences:

ln(ξ j ) ∼ N (0, σ 2 )

(22)

For the purposes of this econometric analysis, this lognormal distribution exhibits a useful
property:
5

Note that per-capita federal spending is non-linear in delegates per-capita. Thus, the empirical estimates of

equation 20 will be more closely aligned with the theoretical model than were those in the reduced form analysis,
which assumed a linear relationship between per-capita federal spending and delegates per-capita.

tax prices using the equation ps = (Ts /Ns )/ k Tk .; these tax prices sum to one nationally.

E(ξ s |ξ s < a) =

where Φ is the cumulative distribution function for the standard normal distribution.

The

second modification accounts for the fact that agenda setting powers in the appropriations
process are conferred upon committees, rather than a single agenda setter. Denote A as the
committee, As = 1(s ∈ A) as a dummy variable indicating state representation on the committee, NA as the size of the committee, and as = As /Ns NA as adjusted per-capita committee
representation. Finally, assuming both eﬃcient bargaining (within committees) and an equal
sharing rule (within committees), equations 20 and 21 can be re-written as follows:

θ(1−As )Nsγ−1 p1/α
exp(σ 2 /2)Φ [(1/σ) ln(Vs ) − (γ/σ) ln(Ns ) − (1/ασ) ln(ps ) − η/σ − σ]
E(gs ) = δas +e
s
(24)

Pr(s ∈ M ) = Φ [(1/σ) ln(Vs ) − (γ/σ) ln(Ns ) − (1/ασ) ln(ps ) − η/σ]

(25)

The parameters of equation 24 and 25 are estimated using a two-step approach. In the first
stage, I estimate a subset of the parameters (γ, α, σ, η), those of equation 25, through a Probit
analysis of inclusion in the coalition for non-committee members. Using these four parameter
estimates, I then estimate the final two parameters (δ, e
θ) through an OLS regression of per-

capita shares (gs ) on committee membership (as ) and the constructed variable in equation 24:
1/α

(1 − As )Nsγ−1 ps

exp(σ 2 /2)Φ [(1/σ) ln(Vs ) − (γ/σ) ln(Ns ) − (1/ασ) ln(ps ) − η/σ − σ].

In order to account for both possible within-state correlations in the sample and the increased uncertainty from including a generated regressor in the second stage regression, bootstrap standard errors are reported.

These standard errors are based upon 100 bootstrap

replications and are clustered at the state level.

Parameter Estimates

As shown in Table 6, the predictions of the model are largely supported in the data.

More

specifically, four of the five coeﬃcients have the signs predicted by equations 24 and 25. Regarding the first-stage coeﬃcients, states costly to include in the coalition, namely those with
high tax prices, are less likely to be included in the coalition. There is less evidence that small
population states are more likely to be included in the coalition as this coeﬃcient is statistically insignificant. Conditional on population, states with larger delegations are more likely to
be included in the coalition, supporting this theoretical hypothesis. As shown in the second
stage results, states represented on the appropriations subcommittee receive significantly more
funds, demonstrating the value of proposal power. Also, states more likely to be included in
the coalition, as captured by the constructed variable, also receive significantly more funds than
do other states.
One important caveat of this baseline analysis involves endogenous committee representation. In particular, state delegations may self-select onto appropriations subcommittees with
jurisdiction over policy areas for which their state has a strong preference. The obvious approach to addressing such self-selection concerns is the inclusion of state by appropriations bills
fixed eﬀects.

Unfortunately, several of the variables in equation 24, such as tax prices and

state population, vary almost exclusively across states.

In order to address the concern of

endogenous committee representation, columns 3 and 4 of Table 6 report results from simple
OLS regressions of per-capita federal spending on per-capita committee representation (excluding the constructed variable). As shown, the results from column 4, which includes state by
appropriations bills fixed eﬀects, suggest a slightly smaller eﬀect of proposal power but are
similar in sign and magnitude to those of column 3, which do not include fixed eﬀects. The
similarity in these two coeﬃcients suggests that endogeneity alone is not driving the positive
coeﬃcient on committee representation in column 2.

18

6.3

Policy Simulations

As noted above, these parameter estimates are then used to provide two insights into the small
state bias measured in section 5. First, using the coeﬃcients and regressors from the second
stage regression, I decompose per-capita federal spending into three components: the proposalpower channel, the vote-cost channel, and a residual. By definition, these three components
sum to observed per-capita federal spending. I then regress each of these components on delegates per-capita; these regressions are analogous to the specifications measuring the small state
bias in Table 5. As shown in Table 7, the proposal-power and vote-cost channels each explain
43 percent of the small state bias, leaving only 14 percent unexplained. The interpretation of
these proportions follows: were representation on the Senate appropriations committee determined by state population rather than delegation sizes, the observed small state bias would fall
by 43 percent. A similar interpretation is possible for the vote-cost channel.
The second simulation, using a subset of the parameters (α, γ), calculates the Samuelson
allocation, that chosen by a central planner maximizing a population-weighted utilitarian social
P
welfare function [W = s Ns h(Gs /Nsγ )]. These parameter estimates, as implied by the two-

stage coeﬃcients, are displayed in Table 8; as shown, all except the congestion parameter

fall within their assumed range.7

As shown in the upper panel of Figure 6, this optimal

allocation exhibits a large-state bias, a positive correlation between per-capita federal spending
and population. Equivalently, as shown in the bottom panel, the Samuelson allocation exhibits
a negative correlation between per-capita federal spending and Senators per-capita. This result
demonstrates the ineﬃciency of the documented small-state bias and suggests that, if anything,
large states should be over-represented in central legislatures.8

To provide intuition for this

result, consider first the extreme case of constant marginal utility from consumption of public
goods (α = 1); in this case, so long as public goods are not perfectly congestible (γ < 1),
social welfare is maximized by concentrating all spending in the state with the largest number
7
8

For the purposes of this simulation, the stochastic component of the model is set to zero (σ = 0).
Of course, this result is dependent on the assumed social welfare function; maximization of an unweighted

social welfare function, for example, may result in the optimality of a small-state bias.

19

of users, or residents.

The introduction of diminishing marginal utility from consumption

(α < 1) mitigates, but does not eliminate, this large-state bias.

Thus, while the estimated

congestion parameter is close to zero, the eﬃciency of the large state bias requires only that
the congestion parameter be less than one.
One caveat involves cross-state spillovers, which are not incorporated into this welfare analysis. To the extent that spending in geographically small states, such as Rhode Island, generates
more benefits for neighbors of bordering states than does spending in geographically large states,
the case for the eﬃciency of a large state bias is overstated. However, small states on a geographic basis are not necessarily small states on a population basis. In fact, the correlation
between state square miles and state population is only 0.1 and is not statistically diﬀerent
from zero.
A related issue of interpretation involves the concentration of project benefits within states.
In particular, many of these projects are not statewide public goods but are local public goods
within the state, suggesting that all residents of large states, such as California, may not benefit
from project spending. This property of project spending would also weaken the case for the
eﬃciency of a large state bias.

However, given that large population states are also more

densely populated than are small population states (and so long as congestion is incomplete),
more residents from large population states will benefit from project spending with localized
benefits, relative to smaller population states.

Thus, the concentration of project benefits

within states may weaken somewhat, but does not eliminate, the eﬃciency of a large state bias.

Conclusion

This paper has provided a theoretical and empirical analysis of a small-state bargaining advantages in the U.S. Senate. A legislative bargaining model, modified to allow for heterogeneous
delegation sizes, demonstrates this bargaining advantage, expressed as a positive relationship
between per-capita delegation sizes and per-capita federal spending.

Two estimable under-

lying channels of a small-state bargaining advantage in the U.S. Senate are then theoretically

20

identified: the proposal-power channel and the vote-yield channel.
The empirical analysis, which is based upon project spending in Congressional appropriations bills, provides several contributions to the literature. The project-based data are highly
manipulable by Congressional delegations, thus providing more accurate estimates of a smallstate bargaining advantage in the U.S. Senate.

In addition, the data identify a sponsoring

chamber (i.e. House or Senate), again allowing for more accurate estimates of this bargaining advantage as well the inclusion of state fixed eﬀects, which control for unobserved state
characteristics. Using this rich data source, the preliminary results demonstrate relationships
between per-capita federal spending and delegates per-capita that are economically significant,
statistically significant, and much stronger than those found in the existing empirical literature.
Simulations demonstrate that the two theoretically-motivated underlying channels, taken together, explain over 80 percent of the measured small-state bias. Finally, a welfare analysis,
which is based upon Samuelson conditions for the optimal allocation of local public goods,
demonstrates the ineﬃciency of the observed small-state bias.
