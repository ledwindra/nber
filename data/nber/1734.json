In particular, the paper explores the properties of a share system as advanced by Martin Weitzman in The Share Economy.The model employed highlights a \"macroeconomic externality\" created in a multi-sector economy with imperfect competition. The introduction of share contracts is shown to influence the comparative static properties of the model economy and in some cases to lead to Pareto superior outcomes.\n\n",
