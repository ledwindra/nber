    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper estimates the effects of several American law firms' international networks of offices on the total value of overseas mergers and acquisitions (M&A) by US corporations. Nowadays many nations can review proposed mergers and US law firms help clients overcome such regulatory hurdles, effectively greasing the market for corporate control. However, they can also oppose transactions that are inimical to their clients' interests. I present evidence that suggests that Baker & McKenzie the US law firm with the most overseas offices has facilitated such transactions, whereas the combined effect of the next five largest American law firms has tended to reduce such M&A.\n\n",
