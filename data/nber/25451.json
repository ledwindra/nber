    "abstract": "\n\nWhat was once broadly viewed as an impossibility \u2013 learning from experimental data in economics \u2013 has now become commonplace.  Governmental bodies, think tanks, and corporations around the world employ teams of experimental researchers to answer their most pressing questions.  For their part, in the past two decades academics have begun to more actively partner with organizations to generate data via field experimentation.  While this revolution in evidence-based approaches has served to deepen the economic science, recently a credibility crisis has caused even the most ardent experimental proponents to pause.  This study takes a step back from the burgeoning experimental literature and introduces 12 actions that might help to alleviate this credibility crisis and raise experimental economics to an even higher level.  In this way, we view our \u201c12 action wish list\u201d as discussion points to enrich the field.\n\n",
