    "abstract": "\n\nWe modify the standard real business cycle model by assuming that wages are set by a monopoly union at the firm level.  In the context of such a model, we introduce a measure of unemployment and analyze its equilibrium behavior.  We show that a calibrated version of the model is capable of generating both a procyclical labor supply and a countercyclical unemployment rate, in a way qualitatively consistent with the evidence.  The model stresses the role of countercyclical markups in the goods market as a key mechanism underlying the countercyclical behavior of unemployment.\n\n",
