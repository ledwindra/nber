Legal Access to Alcohol and Criminality
Benjamin Hansen and Glen R. Waddell
NBER Working Paper No. 22568
August 2016
JEL No. H75,I1,I12,K42
ABSTRACT
Previous research has found strong evidence that legal access to alcohol is associated with sizable
increases in criminality. We revisit this relationship using the census of judicial records on
criminal charges filed in Oregon Courts, the ability to separately track crimes involving firearms,
and to track individuals over time. We find that crime increases at age 21, with increases mostly
due to assaults lacking in premeditation, and alcohol-related nuisance crimes. We find no evident
increases in rape or robbery. Among those with no prior criminal records, increases in crime are
50 percent larger; still larger for the most socially costly crimes of assault and drunk driving. This
suggests that deterring criminality through increased punishments would likely prove difficult.

Introduction

Recent research has found evidence of significant social costs associated with legal access
to alcohol (Carpenter, 2004; Carpenter and Dobkin, 2009; Carpenter and Dobkin, 2010;
Anderson, Crost, and Rees, 2014). We revisit the relationship between alcohol and crime
utilizing the universe of criminal charges filed in Oregon courts from 1990 through 2012.
We follow an approach similar to Carpenter and Dobkin (2015), exploiting the discontinuous
change in legal access to alcohol that occurs at age 21. Our estimates suggests that criminality
increases sharply at age 21, and that the increase is driven by lesser assaults (e.g., those not
involving weapons), including drunk driving and other alcohol-related crimes.
Carpenter and Dobkin (2015) also find that arrests increase substantially at age 21.
However, individuals in California can also legally purchase handguns upon turning 21,
which introduces a potential confounder that may bias estimates of the effect of alcohol that
are identified off of the age-21 discontinuity. The sign and magnitude of any such bias is
an empirical question, of course, determined by how often criminals use legally purchased
handguns to commit crime and whether they are induced into acquiring firearms and/or
criminality upon turning 21. The potential for bias is considerable, however, as handguns
are used in 41 percent of robberies and 21 percent of assaults. Prior research on firearms
also suggests that increases in the prevalence of guns can be associated with increases in
robbery, suicide, and other types of violent crime (Duggan, 2001; Cook and Ludwig, 2006;
Lang, 2014). Unlike in California, legal handgun access in Oregon occurs at age 18, which
leaves the prevalence of firearms smooth at age 21. With no such confounder, our analysis
has the potential to contribute to corroborating earlier analysis.

Utilizing regression-discontinuity models, we find evidence that overall crime increases
with the legal availability of alcohol. Our estimates support the majority of findings of Carpenter and Dobkin (2015), both in sign and magnitude, as we also find increases in assault
and drunk driving at age 21. We find no evidence that weapons-related assaults increase,
and no evidence that robbery or rape increase with the onset of legal access to alcohol.1 This
reproduction is noteworthy, as recent attempts to replicate studies in economics have often
failed. Indeed, Camerer et al. (2016) found only 11 of 18 experimental studies published
in The American Economic Review and The Quarterly Journal of Economics could be reproduced, while Chang and Li (2015) found only 29 of 59 of econometric studies that that
used observational data could be replicated, even with the authors’ original data and coding.
In this instance, adopting a similar econometric approach, but using a different measure of
crime (charges instead of arrests), exploiting crime-commission dates relative to turning 21
instead of arrest date relative to 21, and introducing new data to the literature (Oregon
instead of California), we find strikingly similar estimates. This speaks to both the internal
and external validity one could take away from the joint estimates of the two studies.
In addition, our setting allows us to further identify potential mechanisms, as Oregon’s
assault statutes are coded specifically with regard to the presence of weapons. We find
that increases in assaults are driven by lesser assaults—those not involving weapons—and
no evidence that weapons-related assaults increase, and no evidence that robbery or rape
increase with the onset of legal access to alcohol.
With the universe of Oregon court charges, we are also able to link individuals over time,
1

This is the only outcome for which our findings differ from the Carpenter and Dobkin (2015) results.
However, as their point estimates are within the confidence interval around ours, one should not infer that
the two results are inconsistent.

conditional on not exiting the state. This richness enables an examination of the heterogenous responses of individuals with varying criminal histories. This proves important, as we
show that the increase in criminality around the advent of legal alcohol is 50-percent larger
among individuals who turn 21 without having already collected a criminal record. This
is somewhat discouraging in terms of the effectiveness of traditional channels for reducing
crime—deterrence, for example, as in Becker (1968), Lee and McCrary (2009), and Hansen
(2015)—as these are the same individuals who likely exhibit the lowest a priori propensities
toward criminality. Given that younger individuals exhibit more myopia and less self-control,
this also highlights the potential costs of lowering the minimum legal drinking age (MLDA).
Furthermore, it provides evidence that legal access to alcohol is increasing crime through
individuals who had not yet committed criminal acts, rather than increasing the criminality
of those with a history of violating the law. In as much as this first-time exposure to the
legal system could increase future criminality through negative criminogenic effects, these
sorts of path-dependent outcomes suggest that RD-based estimates would yield lower-bound
estimates of the true, longer-run effect.
In Section 2 we describe our data and methods, which we follow with a discussion of
results in Section 3. As part of this discussion, we exploit the panel structure of our data to
inform our understanding of mechanisms and, in the end, motivate a richer understanding
of behavior and the potential for policy to influence outcomes. In so doing, we also introduce
new evidence regarding the nature of interactions between perpetrators and police around
the onset of legal alcohol consumption. In Section 4 we offer concluding remarks.

Data and Methods

For this study we utilize administrative records on the universe of charges filed in Oregon
courts during the 1990-2012 window, maintained in the Oregon Judicial Information Network. These administrative data are similar to the arrest records used in Carpenter and
Dobkin (2015). An important distinction, however, is that a dataset of charges both discards
arrests for which prosecutors found insufficient grounds to warrant prosecution, and includes
additional charges that often go unobserved in arrest records. For instance, resisting arrest
or assaulting a police officer may not motivate the arrest (and hence can be absent in arrest
records), but would be recorded in charges.
Our main empirical models closely follow Carpenter and Dobkin (2015), utilizing regression discontinuity models that allow for quadratic age effects and a bandwidth of two years
on each side of the age-21 threshold. Our regressions include all criminal charges brought
on individuals between the ages of 19 and 23. (We have also estimated Poisson count-data
models in which we obtained near-identical estimates, both in magnitude and statistical
significance.)

Results

We come to this problem with the benefit of existent literature having established the potential for important heterogeneity across types of crime. Thus, we will proceed quickly to
models that allow for heterogeneity across crime type, after demonstrating a systematic increase in overall crime coincident with the minimum legal drinking age of 21 (see Figure 1)
and facilitating inference by quantifying the discontinuity in overall rates of crime coincident
4

with age 21 (see Table 1). We find a 10.6 percent increase in overall crime when individuals
obtain legal access to alcohol; an increase in the total number of monthly charges of 2,106.

3.1

Crime-specific responses to alcohol availability

In this section, we explore the potential changes in rates of specific crimes around the MLDA
of 21. We largely affirm that the empirical regularities in Carpenter and Dobkin (2015) are
not likely suffering from the confounding effects of handgun availability that are inseparable
from the effects of MLDA in California data.
In Panel A of Figure 2, we separately allow for MLDA-induced discontinuities in crime
across various broad categories: violent crime, property crime, drug crime, and alcohol-related
crime. Doing so makes evident that increases in crime coincident with age 21 are only in
property and alcohol-related nuisance crimes. Rates of violent crime do not increase with
alcohol availability—which is not surprising, to the extent one anticipates that there are
fewer individuals at the margin of committing violent crimes. This pattern is evident more
generally, actually; any measured responsiveness at higher levels of aggregation is typically
being driven by the “less-serious” crimes within that aggregate.
In Panel B, we disaggregate crimes within the broad categories of Panel A—we separate
violent crimes into four underlying contributors, for example (i.e., murder, rape, robbery,
and assaults with and without a weapon). Disaggregating this way again reveals that the
lesser of these crimes (i.e., assault) is responsive to legal access to alcohol, while robbery and
rape are not. This also in keeping with the prior that alcohol plays less of a role in crimes
for which premeditation is possibly more acute. Carpenter and Dobkin (2015) find small

5

but significant increases in robbery, of a magnitude that falls within the confidence interval
around out estimates.
With our additional flexibility allowing for the plotting of the categories of assault, Column (1) reveals that the broader increases in overall rates of assault appear to be exclusive
to those for which there are no weapons involved in the commission of the crime (i.e., in
Oregon, “Assault 3” and “Assault 4”). Conditional on an assault, we again find that alcohol
availability is seemingly mattering more where crimes are of less severity and potentially less
premeditated.
In Column (3) of Figure 2, we plot drug-possession charges across the MLDA threshold
for each drug type and for schedule I through IV drug crimes.2 This reveals two stark
patterns—the potential substitution away from marijuana upon turning 21 and increasing
rates of cocaine-related crime. While subsequent econometric results in Table 3 demonstrate
that the 8-percent decrease in marijuana is not statistically significant, the increase in cocaine
possession is large and significant, and on the order of 28 percent. While point estimates for
methamphetamine and heroin possession are also positive, that cocaine offenses are more
responsive is also consistent with the patten of elasticities falling in crime severity.
When doing a similar unpacking of alcohol-related crimes in Column (4), we see that
DUI’s, reckless driving, disorderly conduct, alcohol possession in parks, and selling to minors
all increase with legal access to alcohol. These increases are also considerable, with DUI and
disorderly conduct exhibiting large increases at age 21 (41 percent, both) while reckless
driving and mischief increase 31 and 15 percent, respectively. (These point estimates are

3.2

Repeat offenders

Our data afford the ability to link individuals over time, which proves important and introduces new results to the literature related to the effect of legal access to alcohol across
criminal history. In figures 3 and 4 we stratify by whether the individual is a repeat or
first-time offender. While broad categories of crime reveal similar patterns across offender
type—significant increases in criminality again appearing in alcohol-related crimes, among
both first and repeat offenders—the disaggregated figures in Panel B reveal interesting distinctions across criminal history. For example, the significant increase in DUI and reckless
driving that is coincident with MLDA are driven by first-time offenders, as is the possession
of alcohol in public parks. Disorderly conduct and selling to minors move similarly for both
first-time and repeat offenders.
Somewhat discouraging, possibly, is that the increase in overall criminality associated
with MLDA is 50-percent larger among individuals who turn 21 without having already
collected a criminal record. (See tables 4 and 5 for these and following point estimates.) These
are the same individuals who exhibit the lowest a priori propensities toward criminality,
which brings the effectiveness of traditional channels for reducing crime—deterrence, for
example. Among the most socially costly crimes that increase at age 21, we see a tentimes larger increase in assaults at age 21 among first-time offenders (with estimated semielasticities of .134 among first-time offenders, compared to .011 among repeat offenders), and
65-percent larger increases in drunk driving among first-time offenders (with estimated semi-

7

elasticities of .416 and .252, respectively). Given that younger individuals exhibit heightened
myopia and less self-control, this also highlights the potential costs of lowering minimum
legal drinking ages.
To the extent alcohol availability induces individuals into criminality, rather than increasing the criminality of those with established histories of violating the law, we should
anticipate higher social costs association with access as much as this first-time exposure
to the legal system could increase future criminality through negative criminogenic effects,
with any such path-dependence implying that RD-based estimates would be lower-bound
estimates of the long-run increase in crime associated with legal access.
This includes the most socially costly crimes that increase at age 21, including assault—
where the increase at age 21 is 10 times larger among first-time offenders—and drunk
driving—where the increase is 65-percent larger among first-time offenders. Given that
younger individuals exhibit heightened myopia and less self-control, this also highlights the
potential costs of lowering minimum legal drinking ages.

3.3

Police Officer Interactions upon Arrest

In the above analysis, we are implicitly attributing the increase in criminality at age 21 to the
presence of alcohol, and not to some coincident increase in the proclivity of police to arrest
or charge individuals for these crimes. Yet, with any inducement into criminality policy is
informed by considering any changes to the nature of police interactions at this margin.
In Figure 5, we plot rates of resisting arrest, officer assault, and the giving of false information. We find significant increases in resisting arrest coincident with the age-21 cutoff,

8

suggesting that with the increased availability of alcohol, perpetrator/officer exchanges are
changing in the direction we might anticipate if alcohol influences perpetrators’ self control.3
Point estimates also imply an 18-percent (but insignificant) increase in assaults on police
officers. There is no apparent increase in the presentation of false information. We find other
interactions with police, such as presenting them with false information, are essentially unchanged. This suggests that police are uniformly increasing all charges for individuals when
they reach the age of 21.

Conclusion

In this paper, we revisit the relationship between access to alcohol and criminality utilizing
data from the universe of criminal charges filed in Oregon from 1990-2012. We find strikingly
similar estimates to Carpenter and Dobkin (2015), which lends to the external credibility of
their findings. Our findings also suggest that a potential source of bias in California-based
estimates—legal access to handguns—is not significantly confounding previous results. The
confirmation of the estimated policy response of criminality associated with legal access
to alcohol across two different states using different measures of crime (arrests instead of
charges) is notable.
However, minor differences do emerge. We find no evidence that robberies increased,
while we did find evidence that certain types of property related crimes, such as burglary,
larceny or trespassing increased at age 21 as well. This could potentially due to measuring
3

While we are unable to rule out such patterns being driven by officer behavior, alcohol is arguably likewise
implicated and we are inclined to interpret these patterns as evidence of alcohol consumption increasing with
MLDA attainment.

criminality through charges rather than through arrests.
The universe of Oregon court charges also allows us to link individuals over time. This
richness thus enables the consideration of heterogenous responses by prior criminal histories.
Doing so reveals 50-percent larger increases in criminality at age 21 among individuals with
no criminal record. This is somewhat discouraging, in terms of the effectiveness of traditional
channels for reducing crime, as these are individuals who likely exhibit the lowest a priori
propensities toward criminality. This includes the most socially costly crimes that increase
at age 21, including assault—where the increase at age 21 is 10 times larger among firsttime offenders—and drunk driving—where the increase is 65-percent larger among first-time
offenders. Given that younger individuals exhibit heightened myopia and less self-control,
this also highlights the potential costs of lowering minimum legal drinking ages.
Furthermore, because the evidence suggests that the MLDA is increasing crime through
individuals who otherwise do not have a history of criminality, it could be the case that
the RD based estimates of the MLDA may be understating the effects of legal access on
crime. This type of bias towards zero could result if exposure to the legal system and time
in jail or prison encourages future criminality through the negative criminogenic effects of
incarceration. As such, RD-based estimates could be viewed as a lower bound for the effect
of legal access to alcohol on criminality.
