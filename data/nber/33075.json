    "abstract": "\n\nThe social and legal recognition of nonbinary people\u2014those who do not exclusively identify with traditionally male or female genders\u2014is growing. Yet, we know little about their economic realities. We offer the first nationally representative evidence on the earnings of nonbinary people using restricted-access 2021 Canadian Census data linked to tax records. We find that, although nonbinary individuals tend to be more educated than their peers, they have significantly lower earnings, especially at the bottom of the income distribution, even after adjusting for various demographic and socioeconomic factors.\n\n",
