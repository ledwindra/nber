Structural Differences and Macroeconomic Adjustment
to Oil Price Increases in a Three—Country Model

ABSTRACT

In this paper a three-country model based on intertemporal
maximizing behavior is constructed in order to analyze the effects
of oil price increases on welfare levels and trade balance positions.

The model can also be used to assess the effects of oil price
increases on the world interest rate, on the final goods terms
of trade between oil importers (what is sometimes called the
real exchange rate), and on output, investment and savings levels,
oil imports3 wages, and consumption at each date.

The analysis highlights the role of structural asymmetries
between oil importers in accounting for differences in trade

balance responses. A number of structural differences are
isolated in turn in order to determine their influence on the
final goods terms of trade, which is the key factor in affecting
relative trade balance positions.

STRUCTURAL DIFFERENCES AND MACROECONOMIC ADJUSTMENT

TO OIL PRICE INCREASES IN A THREE—COUNTRY MODEL

by Nancy Peregrim Marion and Lars E. 0. Svensson

1.

Introduction

In this paper a three—country model based on intertemporal

maximizing behavior is constructed in order to analyze the effects
of oil price increases on welfare levels and trade balance positions.

The model can also be used to assess the effects of oil price increases on the world interest rate, on the final goods terms of trade
between oil importers (what is sometimes called the real (external)

exchange rate), and on output, investment and savings levels, oil
imports, wages, and consumption at each date.

The theoretical interest in these effects is derived, of course,
from the substantial oil price increases that have occurred over the
last eight years, the resulting large surpluses in OPEC's trade

balances, the corresponding overall deficits in the rest of the world
vis—à—vis OPEC, and the differential macroeconomic adjustment among
oil importers.

There is by now an extensive literature on the macroeconomic

effects of oil price increases. However, this literature mostly
relies on a static, small economy analysis that keeps world interest
rates and traded goods prices fixed following an oil price increase.

Such a partial—equilibrium and non—intertemporal approach is limiting

and could be misleading. Moreover, such a single—economy framework
cannot be used to study the differential responses of oil importers
to oil price increases.'
Three—country world equilibrium models have recently been constructed
by Schrnid (1980) and Sachs (1980) ,

but they differ considerably from the

one developed here. Schmid's model of OPEC and two OECD oH importers
is within the monetary—approach—to—the—balance—of—payments tradition and
lacks an explicit treatment of the intertemporal choices involved in
saving and investment behavior that are so crucial to what we think is
a proper analysis of the current account response to oil price increases.

In fact, there is no capital accumulation in his model nor is there a

role for the world interest rate. In addition, he assumes that both
oil importers produce the same final goods, and so ignores the expenditure—switching effects from relative price changes induced by oil price
increases.

Sachs' model of OPEC and two industrial oil importers, on the

other hand, is intertemporal in nature and gives an important role
to capital accumulation and the world interest rate in the macro-

economic adjustment process. However, his model is not used to
examine changes iii welfare levels and relative trade positions that

result from oil price increases. Moreover, it is too complicated to
solve analytically, and is instead examined by simulation methods.
The two—period three—country model developed below is

analytically tractable and easily manipulated and interpreted. It
relies on the dual approach, characterized by the use of expenditure

and GDP functions. Such an approach is formally equivalent to

traditional ones which use utility and production functions, but it

has some practical advantages, among them notational simplicity. Our
way of applying the dual approach has been very much inspired by
Dixit and Norman (1980).

The model is used primarily to isolate the determinants of changes
in welfare levels and of changes in trade balance positions when there

are oil price increases. It shows that welfare levels are influenced
by direct oil terms of trade effects, final goods terms of trade effects

and intertemporal terms of trade effects. Relative trade balance
positions among oil importers are influenced by these same terms of

trade effects and also by a consumption—wealth effect and substitution
effects in consumption and investment.

The model also highlights the role of structural asymmetries
between oil importers in accounting for differences in trade balance

responses. A number of structural differences are isolated in turn
in order to determine their influence on the final goods terms of
trade, which is the key factor in affecting relative trade balance
positions.

it is shown that oil price increases can worsen the relative

trade position of the more oil dependent importer by deteriorating

its final goods terms of trade. Oil price increases also cause a
final goods terms of trade deterioration for the oil importer with
the larger net creditor or smaller net debtor position in the first
period, for the oil importer with more flexible wages in the first
period, and under plausible conditions, for the oil importer with

the smaller marginal propensity to save. Finally, oil price increases

deteriorate the final goods terms of trade of the oil importer with

the smaller degree of substitutability in oil and can hence worsen
its relative trade position.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The three—country
model

The effects of an oil price increase on welfare levels,

trade balances, world interest rates, and the relative price of final

goods are derived. Section 4 analyzes in turn the role of five
structural asymmetries which influence the final goods terms of
trade and hence the relative trade balance response of oil importers.
These structural asymmetries are (1) the degree of oil dependence,
(2) the net creditor or debtor position, (3) the marginal propensity

to save, (4) the employment response and (5) the degree of substi-

tutability in oil. Section 5 provides some concluding remarks.

The home country, the foreign couittiy and OPEC
Consider

a world of three countries in an

intertemporal

framework.

Call the three countries the home country, the foreign country and
OPEC. There are two dates, indexed t = 1 and 2.
At date 1 three goods are produced:

(1) home final goods, produced

exclusively in the home country, (2) foreign final goods, produced
exclusively in
in O1'EC .

the

foreign country, and (3) oil, produced exclusively

At cha te 2, two goods are roduced : a common f ma I good is

produced in the home and foreign countries,2and oil in OPEC. Imported
oil is used as an input in production in the home and foreign countries.
It is neither consumed nor stored.

At date I the non—OPEC

countries

consume home and foreign goods

They can also use their own—produced good for investment purposes in

order to increase their capital stocks at date 2. To capture the lag
in OPEC consumption of its oil revenues, we invoke the extreme
At date 2

assumption that there is no OPEC consumption at date
all three countries consume final goods.

All three countries can trade goods on the world market at each
date. They also have access to a coirnuon world credit market.

OPEC

prices in terms of borne goods at date

1 and in terms of final goods at date 2. The price of foreign goods
in terms of home goods and the home goods rate of interest are
endogenously determined.
let

us now examine the behavior of th home country,

its production side. Let x =

concave production function at date L, where x is output of home goods,

kt the home country's capital stock, 2 its employment level, and z its
input (import) of oil. The representative firm operates competitively.
It is then convenient to represent the production side by means of

the revenue, or GDP, functions,5 yt(p, Qt kt, zt) defined as

and Q1 are the nominal spot prices of home goods and oil

at date 1, measured in some arbitrary unit of account, and P = P2
and Q2 are the nominal spot prices of final goods and oil at date 2.

Throughout the rest of the paper we shall use home goods as the
numeraire at date 1 and final goods as the numeraire at date 2, and

oil price relative to final goods at date 2. Then, yt(1, qt, kt, t)
is GDP, or national value added, measured in home goods at date 1
and final goods at date 2.

We use standard properties of GDP functions to express home goods
supply, the home country's import of oil and its demand price for
labor as

With respect to employment, We assume that labor is fixed in total

supply within the home country. Initially, flexible wages ensure a
given full employment level,

at each date. The full—employment

assumption will be relaxed in Section 4.4.

where p =

(the real exchange rate), and recalling that the

As can be seen from inspection of (2.11), the home country's

GDP at date 1 equals output, x', minus the value of oil

In summary, (2.11) incorporates all

the basic definitions of the trade (current—account) balance, and each
of these measures is based on intertemporal maximizing behavior and is
determined by the same set of factors.

The expressions E and E in (3.11) and (3.12) are the partials of
the expenditure functions with respect to the welfare levels; they
equal the inverse of the marginal utilities of wealth and are positive.

Let us first look at the home country's change in welfare.

We see that the change in welfare, du, is proportional to the sum
of the present value of the static oil terms of trade effects,

_ztdqt, the static final goods term of trade effect, —cdp, and
an intertemporal terms of trade effect, b do. An increase in
today's oil price has a direct negative effect on welfare. An increase in future oil prices also reduces welfare. In addition, an
increase in present or future oil prices alters the relative price

of foreign goods and affects the interest rate. If foreign
goods prices should rise, the home country suffers a static terms—
of trade deterioration which reduces welfare.

,

If the interest

the home country experiences a welfare

gain (loss) if it is a net borrower (lender) in date 1. Thus the
net impict on the home country's welfare depends in part on how oil
price increases affect foreign goods prices and interest

17

rates and whether or not the country is a net borrower or lender
in date 1 .

We

also see that the degree of substitutability in

production between oil, capital, and labor has no direct (first—order)
effect on the home country's welfare.
The

expression

for the foreign country's change in welfare

is analogous, except that the final goods terms of trade effect
is of opposite sign.

Differentiating (3.3) gives the change in OPEC's date 2 consumption (and welfare)

(3.13) 6dc02 =

(xOldql + 6x02dq2) + (qIdxOl + q2dx02) + b°2dó

OPEC's change in welfare is proportional to the sum of the static
oil terms of trade effects and an intertemporal terms of trade
effect, although with signs opposite to the sum of those for

the home and foreign countries. In addition there is an oil
quantity effect, qldxOl + 6q2dx°2, consisting of a change in the

present value of oil revenues due to the change in the home and
foreign countries' oil imports, evaluated at constant oil prices.

This oil quantity effect depends on the degree of substitutability
in production between oil, capital, and labor, which hence direct-

ly influences the change in OPEC welfare. The static oil terms
of trade effects are positive, the intertemporal terms of trade
effect may be of any sign, and the oil quantity effects are likely
to be negative.

18

Let us, somewhat loosely, speak of the sum of the left hand
sides of (3.11) — (3.13) as expressing the (wealth equivalent)
change

in world welfare. It is given by

(3.14) Edu + E*du*

and consists of the oil quantity effect only. The terms of trade
effects are like transfers between the three countries, and they
cancel from tile world point of view. Thus world welfare falls to
the extent that the present value of the home and foreign countries'
oil imports decrease when evaluated at constant oil prices.
To determine the effect of oil price increases on tile trade

balances, we differentiate (3.9), which after some manipulations

are its Hicksian static substitution effects on date 1 consumption

of home and foreign goods given a change in the foreign goods

and E6 are the Hicksian intertemporal consumption

substitution effects, etc.

Let us first look at the change in the home country's trade
balance

at date 1 .

There

are six determinants of the trade balance

response. The first term on the right—hand side of (3.15) is a

direct oil terms
in

of

trade

effect

on date 1

GDP

caused by an increase

date 1 oil prices. An increase in today's oil prices has a

negative effect on date 1 GDP and thus worsens the trade balance.
The second term in (3.15) is the final goods terms of trade

effect; any increase in p causes a terms of trade deterioration at
home vis

vis the foreign oil importer and worsens the home country's

trade balance.

The third term is a consumption wealth effect caused by the change

in welfare that accompanies oil price increases, If the home country
suffers a welfare loss as a result of oil price increases, household

expenditures will fall. This drop in absorption improves the trade

balance. The bracketed expression in the second term is the wealth
equivalent of the change in the home country's welfare, given by
(3.11).

20

The fourth term on the right—hand side of (3.15) represents a

date I final goods consumption substitution effect. If oil price in—
creases should raise foreign goods prices, households will
shift their expenditures away from foreign goods and toward home

goods. If own—substitution effects dominate cross—substitution
effects, then net expenditures will fall, improving the trade
balance.

The fifth term in (3.15) is an intertemporal consumption substitution
effect. An inc rease in the discount factor boosts house—

hold

absorption

of date 1 goods and worsens the trade balance.

The last term consists of investment substitution effects.
If the increase in oil prices lowers interest rates, invest-

ment demand is stimulated. This increase in absorption hurts
the trade balance. An increase in date 2 oil prices also alters
the marginal profitability of investment. If capital and oil are
complements in date 2 production, an increase in future oil prices

will lower the marginal product of capital. This leads to a drop
in investment demand which improves the trade balance.
It is readily seen from (3.16) that the same six determinants

affect the foreign country's date 1 trade balance. There are two
important differences in the direction of effect, however. First,
any increase in p causes a final goods terms of trade gain for the

foreign country (c dp > 0) while causing a loss for the home
country. Second, an increase in p also has an effect on investment
behavior in the foreign country that is absent in the home country.

21

This latter difference appears because the two countries use country—

specific capital, and it would disappear if the two countries employed
the

same capital goods in date 2.

Let us now study the endogenous changes in the
discount factor and the price of foreign goods caused by oil

price increases. Differentiating (3.6) and (3.7), making use
of (3.11) and (3.12) and manipulating, we get

We assume gross substitutability, which is sufficient for stability.

We also assume that oil price increases lead to excess supply (at
constant discount factor and foreign goods price) of both home and

foreign goods. The latter assumption holds if the negative substitution effects on output, x1dqand x*1dq1, are dominated by the other
effects, which are all positive.

This expression can be nicely interpreted. The ratio (dfo/dho)

The ratio (s/s1) gives the relative world excess supply of foreign

goods from the oil price increases, at constant discount factor and

foreign goods price. If this relative world excess demand for
foreign goods exceeds this relative world excess supply, the price of
foreign goods must rise.

4.

Differences in structure, the price of foreign goods, and
the relative trade balance response
Clearly, if the home and foreign countries are alike in every

respect, there will be no change in the foreign goods price, and the

two oil importers will have identical trade balance responses to
exogenous oil price increases. In this section we look at how
structural differences between the home and foreign countries
influence the foreign goods price response to oil price increases.

We also examine how structural asymmetries can account for differences
in the relative trade balance response.

A number of structural asymmetries can be examined in order
to assess their impact on the final goods terms of trade (p) when

there are oil price increases. We choose to focus on five which are
widely thought to be important and/or which are amenable to future

empirical testing. The five structural characteristics are (1) the
degree of oil dependence, (2) the net creditor or debtor position,
(3) the marginal propensity to save, (4) the employment response,

and (5) the degree of substitutability in production. We shall
examine the implications of each structural asymmetry in turn.

Our method will be to assume that the home and foreign countries

are identical except in one respect atatime. Let the initial

25

situation

be one where the relative price of foreign

goods

equals

unity,
(4.1) p = 1.
We start by assuming that the home and foreign countries have the
same bias towards their own good, in the sense that their
marginal propensities to consume home and foreign goods at date 1
fulfill

of oil dependence

The conventional view is that oil price increases cause larger
trade balance deteriorations in those economies that are heavily

dependent on oil imports. This view has been challenged recently
by Sachs (1981), who argues that differential dependence on oil
imports has little effect on relative trade positions if the oil

price shock is perceived as permanent, but does matter if the shock

is temporary. The analysis below suggests that the degree of oil
dependence does influence the trade—balance response to all types
of oil price increases, whether temporary, permanent or future, but
that oil dependence is just part of the story.

26

Suppose that the home country is more oil dependent in each

period than the foreign country, in the sense that

and from (3.26) it follows that the foreign goods price rises.
The country with the higher degree of oil dependence suffers a final

goods terms-of—trade deterioration. The intuitive reason is straightforward. The country with the higher degree of oil dependence faces
a greater welfare loss when oil prices rise. Consequently at date 1
the drop in demand for home goods is greater than the drop in demand
for foreign goods. The relative excess supply of home goods that
results put upward pressure on p.

Since

the home country is more oil dependent, it faces a higher

value of oil imports when oil prices increase. This causes a negative
direct effect on the relative trade balance, represented by the first
term on the right hand side of (4.8). But the home country also
experiences a greater welfare loss when oil prices rise and hence a

greater drop in absorption. This causes a positive consumption wealth
effect on the relative trade balance, represented by the second term

on the right hand side of (4.8). The net of these two effects is
ambiguous.

Consider for a moment the effect of a temporary oil price

increase. This disturbance has a negative direct effect on the relative
trade balance and a smaller positive consumption wealth effect. Hence
the temporary oil price increase worsens the relative trade balance
for constant p.

A future oil Price increase has only a positive consumption wealth
effect and hence improves the relative trade balance for constant p. Finally,
a permanent oil price increase has both a negative direct effect and a
positive consumption wealth effect, with an ambiguous impact on the
relative trade balance for constant p.

If the home country's aggregate marginal

propensity to consume is the same at both dates, i.e. C =

then permanent oil price increases will have no effect on relative
trade positions, regardless of the asymmetry in oil dependence. This
is Sachs' (1981) story. But as soon as we relax the restrictive
assumptions in (4.9) and as soon as we allow for the endogenous
change in the foreign goods price, this strong result fails to hold.

Returning to (4.8), we see that the increase in the foreign
goods price generated by higher oil prices has three additional effects

on the relative trade balance. It has a negative direct effect, a
smaller positive consumption wealth effect (both represented by the
third term on

effect. The

the

right hand side of (4 .8)) and a negative investment

latter

effect is due to the country-specific capital

used at home and abroad; an increase in p raises the cost of investment goods in the foreign country and hence reduces foreign absorption

at the first date. This investment effect worsens the relative trade
balance; however, it would disappear if both countries used the same
capital goods in production.

29

We conclude that temporary and permanent oil price increases

which worsen importers' trade balances will have graver consequences
for the relatively oil—dependent importers.

Of course, oil importers are apt to diffr in a number of
structural characteristics which influence p, so the correlation
between oil dependence and the relative trade balance response is
likely to be missed unless these other asymmetries are also taken
into account.

4.2

The net creditor or debtor position
Now suppose the two oil importers are similar in all relevant

respects

except for their net lending positions. Specifically, we

assume
(4.11) b1 > b*1,

which by (2.12) and (2.20) implies

(4.12) b2 < b*2.

It follows that

(4.13) dh < df6

and 5h =

Sf.

From (3.26) and (4.13) it follows that the foreign goods price increases.
The home country, with the larger net creditor position or smaller
net debtor position in date 1, faces an additional final goods terms
of trade deterioration in response to oil price increases.

The rationale is intuitive. Oil price increases raise the
discount factor, and the drop in the real interest rate causes a

30

lrger welfare loss for the home country with its larger net creditor
position in date 1.

It experiences the greater negative consumption

wealth effect, so on net there will be a greater excess supply of home

goods relative to foreign goods in date 1. This puts upward pressure
on p.

Since the endogenous increase in the discount factor causes a
larger welfare loss for the home country in date 1, it has a positive
consumption wealth effect on the relative trade balance, represented by
the first term on the right hand side of (4.14).

The endogenous

increase in the foreign goods price, i.e. the deterioration of the home
country's final goods terms of trade, has a negative direct effect on
the relative trade balance and a smaller positive consumption wealth
effect, both of which are represented by the second term in (4.14),
and a negative investment effect.

Hence when

two oil importers are identical in all relevant respects except for
their net lending positions, the relative trade balance response to
oil price increases cannot be determined without knowledge of specific
parameter values.

4.3 The marginal propensity to save

Suppose that at date 1 the home country has a smaller marginal
propensity to save, and hence a large propensity to consume, than the

foreign country. Assume that the two countries still have the same

The effect of a temporary oil price increase on the foreign goods

i.e., the

foreign

goods price increases. The home country, with the

smaller marginal propensity to save, faces a final goods terms of
trade deterioration when there is a temporary oil price increase.

This is because for a given loss in welfare caused by the oil price
increase, the drop in demand for home goods will exceed the drop in

demand for foreign goods. The relative excess supply of home goods
that results puts upward pressure on the foreign goods price.
The

effect

of a future oil price increase on the foreign goods

price is indeterminate. As before, if the

home country has the

smaller

marginal propensity to save at date 1, a given welfare loss will cause
a drop in demand for home goods that exceeds the drop in demand for

foreign goods. This tends to put upward pressure on p. However, the
expected increase in future oil prices also reduces investment demand

for date 1 goods, releasing more of them for date 1 consumption. With
the smaller marginal propensity to save, the home country will

experience the smaller excess supply of domestic goods when investment

demand is curtailed. This puts downward pressure on p. Only if this
investment effect is dominated can we say the oil importer with the
smaller marginal propensity to save date 1 goods will suffer a final

goods terms of trade loss when there are future oil price increases
or current oil price increases of a permanent nature.

Oil

price increases have a direct negative effect on welfare

has the smaller marginal propensity to save, it will respond with a
greater cut in absorption and this will have a positive effect on the
relative trade balance, represented by the first term on the right

hand side of (4.19). The endogenous increase in the discount factor
will have a positive effect on welfare in hoth countries since both

have the same trade deficit in date 1. But the home country, with
its larger marginal propensity to consume, will respond with a
greater increase in absorption, and this will have a negative effect

on the relative trade balance, represented by the second term in

(4.19). If the net welfare effect is negative, oil price increases will
have a positive effect on the relative trade balance for constant p.
Since the change in the foreign goods price can be in either direction,

we cannot determine its effect on the relative trade balance. Consequently, when two oil importers are alike in all relevant respects
except for their marginal propensities to save, we cannot calculate

the relative trade balance response to oil price increases without
knowing specific parameter values.

4.4 The employment response
So far we have assumed flexible wages and full employment at each

date in the home and foreign countries. In this section we shall
examine the consequences of rigid wages and variable employment at

the first date in the home country. We maintain the assumption of
flexible wages and full employment at the first date in the foreign
country, and in both countries at the second date.

14

First,

t us now I uok at

employment

suppose that the wage

in

the

home count ry at date

1

is fixed in terms of home goods at the

first date, i.e., wages are indexed to the GDP deflator. The level
of employment is then given by the condition that the demand price

for labor, Y, equals the wage. Hence, the date 1 employment function,
L (w , q

,

k

is

),

defined by

(4.20) Y(l, q', k1, L1(1, q1, k1)) = w1,

where w1 is the wage in terms of date

where the second order derivative Y is negative by the concavity
of the GDP function. Hence employment at date 1 is always a decreasing
function of the real wage, a decreasing function of the oil price at
date 1 by the assumption of complementarity between oil and labor,

and an increasing function of the capital stock by the assumption of

complementary between capital and labor. With real wages fixed in
terms of home goods at date 1, the change in the home country's date 1
employment level in response to an oil price increase will hence be
given by

(4.22) d = L1dq1

0,

ie employment at date 1 decreases.

price increases cause a drop in the home country's

employment level at date 1, there is a greater drop in the production

of home goods relative to the production of foreign goods. The
relative excess supply of foreign goods which results puts downward

pressure on p. Consequently, the oil importer with rigid real wages
experiences a final goods terms of trade gain when there are oil price

increases. This effect is counter to the negative employment effect.
Which effects dominates depends, of course, on the specific parameters.

When wages are rigid in the home country, oil price increases
reduce employment and cause a bigger drop in home GDP relative to

foreign GDP. This causes a negative direct plus consumption—wealth
effect on the relative trade balance, represented by the first term

on the right hand side of (4.28). The improvement in the home country's
final goods terms of trade causes a positive direct plus consumption—
wealth effect on the relative trade balance, given by the second term

in (4.28), and a positive investment effect. Consequently there is no
direct correlation between the degree of wage rigidity and the response
of the relative trade balance to oil price increases.

addition to the direct effect of an oil price increase, there is

the overall effect of an oil price increase on employment

is now ambiguous.

By the same argument as above it can indeed be shown that the

foreign goods price does unambiguously fall. (di1 in (4.25)

is simply replaced by L1dq1.) If Ihen the overall change in employment
is positive, we see that both the employment effect and the fiiial

goods terms of trade effects on home welfare are positive in (4.23).
Also, the relative trade balance in (4.28) is unambiguously positive.
Does it follow that it is always better for the home country to

have the wage fixed in terms of a CPI rather than in home goods? No,
since with wages fixed according to a CPI, the supply of home goods

is more elastic with respect to the price of foreign goods. Uence
the fall in the foreign goods price is smaller with given CPI wages

than with given home goods wages. Thus the final goods terms of trade
gain is smaller with CPI wages, although the employment effect is
less negative or even positive.

4.5 The degree of substitution
Suppose that the two oil importers are identical in every relevant
respect except for the degree of substitutability in production betweeti

oil and domestic capital and labor. We assume that the home country has
less such substitutability at date 1 so that it experiences a smaller
absolute response in the full employment level of output of home

goods to an oil price increase. That is, we assume

(4.32) x*1 < x1

which says that the foreign goods price increases. With a given level
of employment and capital stock utilization in each country at date 1,
the home country, with the smaller degree of substitutability in oil,
faces a smaller decline in production at date 1.

The relative excess

supply of home goods that results puts upward pressure on p.

hence,

the country with less substitutability in production suffers a final
goods terms of trade loss.

The relative trade balance response is

The deterioration in the home countryts final goods terms of trade
has a negative direct plus consumption—wealth effect on the relative
trade balance, represented by the first term on the right hand side of

(4.35), and a negative investment effect. Hence oil price increases
worsen the relative trade balance response; the oil importer with the
smaller degree of substitutability in oil suffers a greater negative
effect on its trade balance.

5. Conclusion
This paper represents the first attempt in the literature to
construct an explicitly intertemporal three—country model in order
to analyze the effects of oil price increases on countries' welfare

40

levels and relative trade balance positions. The model uses aggregates
which are consistent with maximizing behavior and yields a rich array
of analytically tractable results.
For instance, the determinants of changes in welfare levels
and of changes in trade balance positions when there are oil price

increases are readily isolated. Changes in output levels, oil
imports, investment, employment, wages, saving and consumption can

also be calculated for individual oil importing countries. The
three—country world equilibrium model also takes account of the
feedback effects of higher oil prices on the world interest rate and
the final goods terms of trade between oil importers (the real exchange
rate).

One important finding is that structural asymmetries between
oil importers cause oil price increases to alter the final goods
terms of trade in systemmatic ways, and these movements in the final
goods terms of trade play a crucial role in determining an oil
importer's relative trade balance position in the face of oil price

increases. Despite some recent thought to the contrary, the degree
of oil dependence does influence a country's relative trade balance

position. So does a country's degree of substitutability in oil.
Other structural characteristics, such as a country's relative
international lending position, its relative marginal propensity to

save, and is degree of wage flexibility in the short run also
alter the final goods terms of trade in predictable ways and influence
an oil importer's relative trade balance position.

In short, the model presented here allows us to analyze some

41

important general equilibrium interrelationships in detail and to
study the differential macroeconomic adjustment of oil importers
to oil price increases.

For partid. equilibrium analyses of effects of oil price increases

that emphasize intertemporal aspects, see Bruno (1981), Marion (1981),

Obstfeld (1980), Sachs (1981), and Svensson (1981). Dixit (1981) presents

The assumption of a common final good at date 2 greatly

simplifies

analysis and makes possible intuitive explanations of the results

to follow. It is also warranted since we are mainly interested in
the date 1 final goods price and relative trade balance responses.

Precise conditions on the countries' preferences and/or technologies

can also be found under which home and foreign goods at date 2 could
be rigorously aggregated into one aggregate final good at date 2.
See Svensson and Razin (1981) and Svensson (1981) for such analyses
applied to the study of trade balance responses.

3.

What is necessary for the results below is the reasonable assumption

that OPEC's marginal propensity to consume at the first date is smaller
than that of the home and foreign countries. Assuming that there is

4

zero OPEC consumption at the first date however greatly simplifies
the analysis.

4.

For the implications of an endogenous OPEC policy that maximizes

OPEC welfare, or of an OPEC policy which sets oil prices at each date
in terms of date 2 final goods, see Marion and Svensson (1981, in progress).

5.

The GDP function is also called the value—added, the restricted

profit, the variable profit, the GNP, or the revenue function. A comprehensive reference is Bruno (1978) or Diewert (1974) .

See Varian (1978)

for a micro—textbook using this and similar dual functions, and Bruno
(1973), Chipman (1972), Dixit and Norman (1980), Khang (1971), and
Woodland (1981) for their use in international trade theory.

Note that complements in this sense is not a very restrictive

assumption. This definition of complements/substitutes is different
from the ones usually employed in the literature. Complements!
substitutes are mostly defined, in analogy with the definition of Hicksian

complements/substitutes in consumption, from the sign of the partial
of the demand for a factor with respect to the price of another factor,

at constant output level. See Berndt and Wood (1979) for a thorough
discussion of such Hicksian complementarity/substitutability between
oil and other factors. Factors can be Hicksian substitutes and yet
complements in our sense. This is indeed the case with the specific
separable technologies discussed by Berndt and Wood, when
x =

f(g(k,

e), h(9., m)), f(•), g(•) and h(.) are linearly homogenous,

e is energy input, and m is input of non—energy materials.
