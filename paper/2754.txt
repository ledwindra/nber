TESTING STRATEGIC BARGAINING MODELS USING STOCK MARKET DATA
ABSTRACT

This paper presents three empirical teats of a class of asymmetric
information bargaining models using stock market data.

behind these models is that protracted bargaining can be used to infer

if bargaining is primarily motivated by the union's

A second prediction of many of the one—sided asymmetric information
models of strikes is that a negatively sloped wage "concession function"
exists.

That is the union's wage demands should decline as a strike

This provides some evidence concerning the reliability of the

The bargaining model suggested two other empirical regularities which
should show up in the data:

the excess returns on average should be

Table 3 gives mean and median daily excess returns for the

The mean and •edian cumulative

Disaggregating the data by the duration of the strike

reveals that the mean CERs are negative for all but one of the duration

categories while the median CER's are negative for all duration categories.
The largest mean CER is for strikes of 2—3 •onths in duration and indicates

The market reaction to the settlement of a strike is given in table

There is a mixed pattern of positive and negative excess returns in the dayc

Both the mean and median excess returns are

positive on the settlement date and indiéate an equity gain of around 0.2%.
12The standard errors for the mean excess returns are calculated under the
assumption that the excess returns are Independent across negotiations as
well as across observations within a negotiation. The variance of the
excess return is assumed to equal the residual variance estimated from the
market model. As such, these standard errors are only approximate and are

Strategic bargaining •odels suggest that strikes may be used as a
