    "abstract": "\n\nIn many countries, banks lend to firms controlled by the bank?s owners.  We examine the benefits of related lending using a newly assembled dataset for Mexico.  Related lending is prevalent (20% of commercial loans) and takes place on better terms than arm?s-length lending (annual interest rates are 4 percentage points lower).  Related loans are 33% more likely to default and, when they do, have lower recovery rates (30% less) than unrelated ones.  The evidence supports the view that rather than enhance information sharing, related lending is a manifestation of looting.\n\n",
