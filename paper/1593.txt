Optimal Time—Consistent Fiscal Policy
with Uncertain Lifetimes

ABSTRACT

This paper studies optimal fiscal policy in an economy where

heterogeneous agents with uncertain lifetimes coexist. We show that
some plausible social welfare functions lead to time—inconsistent opti-

mal plans, and we suggest restrictions on social preferences that

avoid the problem. The normative prescriptions of a time—consistent
utilitarian planner generalize the 'two—part Golden Rule" suggested
by Samuelson, and imply aggregate dynamics similar to those arising

in the Cass—Koopmans—Ramsey optimal growth framework. We characterize
lump—sum transfer schemes that allow the optimal allocation to be
decentralized as the competitive equilibrium of an economy with

actuarially fair annuities. The lump—sum transfers that accomplish
this decentralization are age dependent in general.

transfer scheme; that allow the optimal allocation to be decentralized
through a competitive economy with actuarially fair annuities.

An important finding of the paper is that the above—mentioned
transfers are in general age dependent. It follows that the aggregative
fiscal policies studied in the recent literature will usually fail to
achieve the optimal allocation. If first—best fiscal policy tools are
unavailableq however, the door is opened to the type of general—
equilibrium time inconsistency studied by Kydland and Prescott (1977>,
Calvo (1978), and others.

The paper is organized as follows. Section I reviews the
individual's problem and the competitive equilibrium of an economy in
which there is no uncertainty at the aggregate level. Section II takes
up utilitarian planning and the time—consistency problem. In section III
the allocation chosen by a time—consistent utilitarian planner is
characterized. Section IV discusses lump—sum redistribution schemes that

C;ompetitive Equilibrium with Annuities

To make the paer self—contained, this section briefly reviews the
interteinporal alloctian problem of an individual with an uncertain
lifetime who purchases actuarially fair annuities. While the conclusions
merely repeat those of Yaari (1965), the presentation of the problem is
slightly different and hopefully more transparent. The section conclude;
by describing the economy's aqgregate dynamics in perfect—foresight
equilibrium.

An individual born at time v (his 'vintage) is uncertain about
the length N of hi; life. Let F(.) denote the cumulative distribution
function of the random variable N, so that F(n)

F(n) = 1. Implicit in our notation is the

assumption that the distibution of N does not depend on vz in addition

is

assumed to be continuous and piecewise differentiable with an

associated

probability density function +L) satisfying F(n> =

SF(s)ds.

Individuals maximize the expected value over possible lifespan; of a
discounted integral of future instantaneous utilities. The time—t
utility of a vintage—v individual is a function u(.) of consumption
c(v,t).4 If

lifetime utility for an agent born on date v is

(1)

U(v)

Sf(n){SVu[c(v,t))expEt_vHdtHn.

The function u(.) is assumed to be bounded, strictly concave, and
twice continuously differentiable. Notice that u(.) is assumed to be
independent of v. Only consumption paths c(v,.) that are piecewise
continuous and right—hand differentiable are considered. To ensure
interior solutions, the usual Inada conditions are imposed.

The objective function (2) therefore takes the form

U(v) =

uEc(v,t))exp{-StE+p(s-v)Jds)dt.

As in Yaari (1965), the possibility of death leads to a higher subjective discount rate on future utility.

Assume now, as in Blanchard's (1985) model, that a new cohort of
individuals is born each instant and that there is no aqgregate uncertainty ever though each individual's lifespan is stochastic. If the size
of

each newly—born cohort is normalized to unity, there are exactly 1 —

F(t—v) individuals of vintage v alive at any time t

v and this

cohorts size declines at rate p(t—v). Those within a given cohort are
a;suied to be identical in all respects.

Individuals are prohibited from dying in debt, and can borrow only
if they simultaneously buy insurance against that contingency. There
exist

insurance :ompanies that buy and issue annuities which pay holders

nonhuman

Because there are no bequests, those with positive

alth will choose

nuities, which pay a rate

to hold it exclusively in the fora of an-

exceeding the sarket real interest rate while

the owner live;. Borrowers effectively insure themselves against accidental death by issuing annuities to the insurance company. In short,
insurance companies intermediate between all borrowers and lenders and

also hold the private sectors net marketable assets, which in the
present context will coincide with the capital stock. Under the assump—
tions of the preceding paragraph, and with costless free entry into the
insurance industry, the insurance premium p(t—v) is actuarially fair and
the insurance company makes zero profits. The instantaneous effective
borrowing rate faced at time t by an individual born at time v is thus
r(t) + p(t—v)

,

where r(t) is the real interest rate and p(t—v) is the

actuarially fair insurance premium.

The lifetime problem of an individual born on date v may now be
stated

as follows: choose a consumption

mize (5> subject to
(6) c(v,t)exp{-ftEr(s)+p(s-v))ds}dt

a(vv).

In (6), a(v,t) is the overall time—t wealth of an agent of vintage v.

Wealth is the sum of of the

present

discounted value of wages (human

wealth, the present discounted value of expected future transfer pay-

ments from the government, and capital.

L =

affect the time derivative of consumption along an optimal path (although they do affect the level of consumption through (6>).

in equilibrium. The first two terms on the right—hand side of (11) sum
to the difference between the consumption of the newly born and the
overall consumption of those who die at time t. The third term is just
the sum of the individual consumption changes dictated by the Euler
equation (B).

The steady state is defined by DC

0. Without simplifying

assumptions, it is quite difficult to characterize the steady—state
allocation for this competitive economy. For example, if p(n) is a
constant p as in Merton (1971) and Blanchard (1985), and if u(c) =
(R > 0), then it is easy to see that the steady—state real

interest rate rc =

y/(KL)

must satisfy rC

pR. (KL is the steady—

state capital stock in the competitive model when there is rio government
intervention.)

The system becomes quite simple under Blarichards (1985) additional assumptions that R =

needed to support optimal growth paths as competitive equilibria. We
next discuss the meaning of "optimality1 and the implied intertemporal
resource allocation for a centrally—planned economy.

II. Time—Consistent Utilitarian Planning
In this section we describe the objective function of a
utilitarian planner whose preferences admit time—consistent optimal
plans. The planner is utilitarian in the sense that his welfare objective is a weighted sum of the utilities of

all

generations, including

those not yet born.
Samuelson (1967. 1968) ,

building

on a suggestion of Lerner (1959),

was the first to study utilitarian planning in an economy with finitely—
lived overlapping generations. In the model of Samuelson (1968), a
generation lives for two periods and a new generation is born each
period until a known date T in the future. Thus, the last generation is
born on date 1—1.. If an individual born on date t enjoys lifetime

utility uEc(t,t),c(t,t+1)J, Samuelson's planner maximizes

5(0) TIt[(tt) ,c(t,t+1H,

—9—

subject to constraints discussed below, on date 0. The parameter
c(0,13 gives the rate at which the planner discounts future generations'

utility (wth 3

1

the Ramsey case). lthouqh Saniuelson assumes a

finite horzon, he characterizes a hypothetical steady—state allocation
satisfying first—order conditions for maximization of S(0).
The welfare criterion 9(0) generally yields time—inconsistent

proqrams if the planner is constrained only by the initial capital stock
K(0) and the saving—investment relation K(t+l) —
—

c(t—1,t)

K(t)

=

Y[K(t))

—

c(t,t)

In other words, for s ; 0, the consumption plan

{c(t,t),c,t+1)) maximizing 9(0) subject to resource constraints
does not maximize B(s) if followed from time s onward. The reason for
this is that the .Bamuelson criterion does not attach an appropriate

eght to tre welfare of the old generation alive at the start of the
plan. In each periods, maximization of B(s) requires that consumption
by the old be zero, even though this was not planned when 5(s—l) was
max i

ni z

ed

Samuelson (196) in effect avoids time inconsistency by placing an
additional constraint on the planner: the requirement that the consump—

tlDn of the old in period s, c(s—1s), be taken as given. If this
predetermined consumption level for the old is interpreted as the level
envisioned in the previous period's optimal plan, the planner is forced
to pursue a time—consistent program. However, Samuelson does not offer
this interpretation, and no suggestion is made regarding social institutions that might impose a time—consistency constraint.

The welfare criterion introduced here avoids time inconsistency by
explicitly and appropriately accounting for the welfare of cohorts
already alive at the planning period's start. No dynamic—consistency
constraint is placed on the planner's actions. The social welfare func—

— 1 0—

tion proposed in S;muel;on (1967)

also

avoid; time—inconsistency without

side constraints, but only under restrictive assumptions on individual

preference; that ;as. onie of the isues discussed below. (Samuelson
(1967) assumes that u[c(t,t),c(t,t+1)]

vCc(t,t) + vtc(t,t+l)], so

that individuals do not discount future utility.) It is noteworthy (but
not surprising) that the optimal plans explored below entail intertem—
poral and intergenerational allocation rules which generalize those
derived oy Samuelson (1967, 1968).

Our planners objective is the sum of two components. First, there
is the lifetime expected utility of the generation; to be born as
measured from the moment of birth. Second, there is the expected
utility, over the reaainder of their lifetimes, of those cohort; currently alive. The remaining expected utility of a cohort currently alive
is. like that of a cohort to be born, measured from the perspective of
its birthdate. If it is assumed in addition that the planner discounts
generation; at a rate p > 0, the social welfare function is

(14) W(0)

(5uEc(v,t)]exp-ft[S+p(s-v))ds)dt)exp(-pv)dv
+ SU(.JuEc(v,t)]exp{_itEC+p(s_v)]ds)dt)exp(_pv)dv

at time t =

0.

W(0)

has

an alternative interpretation. Its first com-

ponent may be viewed as a weighted integral of instantaneous utilities
actually enjoyed by members of future generations, discounted to the
date of birth at the "risk—free" rate S.

(Recall that there is no aq—

uncertainty.> The second component is the weighted integral of

utilite; to be enjoyed by living members of the current generations,
also discounted to their birthdates at rate C. The planners maximization must be carried out subject to an initial capital endowment K(0)

and the constraint (10), which is repeated here (after substitution from

(9)) for converiience

(1) DK(t) =Y[K(t)] -

.ftc(v,t)expC_ftps_vds]dv.

It may appear unnatural to discount the utility of those already

alive ack to their birthdates, rather than to the present. After all,
the planner is concerned with their welfare from the present (time t =

0) onward. However, this discounting scheme is necessary for the time
consistency of optimal intertemporal allocations. Unless those alive and
those to be born are treated symmetrically, the planner has an incentive
to

cha9e the consumpti on previ ously planned for unborn eneraUors once

they come into existence.'
To appreciate the time inconsistency problem consider the

"natural social welfare function

(14') V(0) =

(u[c(v,t))expC-!tU+p(s-v)]ds}dt)exp(-pv)dv

S°(u[c(v,t)Jexp{-5[+ps-v

the expected utility of the surviving members of current

generations is measured from the perspective of time 0. If it is

as-

sumed for simplicity that p(n) is a constant p, then for I > 0,

V(0)

V(T) + J1(T)

+

J7(T)

+

+

An apparent alternative to (14) would treat current and future

generations symmetrically by discounting all utility back to time 0.
But this is equivalent to raising p to p +
in (14).
8

As noted above, Samuelson (1967) studies the maximization of a
social welfare function similar to (14) in an overlapping—
generations model with deterministic two—period lifetimes. However,
he assumes a finite planning horizon, no individual time preference,
and no generational preference on the part of the planner. In
Bamuelsons framework, therefore, ' = 0, which would imply no distinction between (14) and (14').

that a plan maximizing

not in general maximize V(T) given the resulting K(T). The reason for
this is that any plan optimal at time

planner with preferences described by (14') will

therefore be time inconsistent. Prriving at T with capital K(T), he will
prefer to maximize V(T) and so will deviate from the plan that maximized
V

(0)
Yet another alternative to (14), particularly appealing when the

instantaneous death probability is a constant p, is to treat all those
alive at time zero as if they had just been born i.e., as if they were
all of vintage zero. It is easily verified that this 'egalitarian"
scheme, like (14'), generally yields a time—inconsistent optimum. The
exception occurs when p =

, so

that the planners objective is identi-

cal to a special case of (14), that in which consumption is optimally
equal across cohorts at any time.

The time consistency of plans maximizing W(0) subject to the

constraints can be seen by noting that for T

W(0) =

W(T) + R,

and R.. are predetermined as of time T. It follows that any plan

maximizing W(0) iven K(0) must maximize W(T) given the implied value of
K(T,. Otherwise there would exist a plan yielding the same values of

KtT)

,

R1, and R2, but a higher value of W(T) . And this would contradict

the assumed optimality of the initial plan.

9

An implication of our analysis is that the credibility of a plan-

ner will depend on the way he weights generations utilities. This
complication is not found in the Cass—Koopmans framework with nonover—
lapping generations. There, it is a matter of indifference whether the
planner discounts instantaneous utility according to the time at which
it

is

enjoyed or the generation that enjoys it. Here the distinction is

cruci al.

10

It should now be clear that there is a time—consistent analogue of
the Samuelson criterion 3(0) which embodies the discounting convention incorporated in our welfare measure W(0). That criterion is
CuCc(—l,—1),c(—l,0)J/} +3(0), which is maximized at time 0 given
the (predetermined) consumption level c(—l,—1) enjoyed in their
youth by those currently old.
10

If one were to insist that optimal plans should be time consistent,
our findings would give some guidance regarding admissible social
welfare functions. This is reminiscent of Koopinans (196) discussion, where its is shown that a nonnegative planner's discount rate
is required to ensure the existence of an optimal plan when population s growing. Note that our analysis would be unchanged if the
discount rate applied by the planner to generation v at time t were
expC—p(v—t)] (as in Cass and Koopmans) rather than exp[—pv].

iii. The Optimal lIocation over Tise
The intartemporal resource allocation chosen by a time—consistent
utilitarian planner is studied in this section. That optrnum is qualItatively

similar

to the one arising in the familiar Cass—Koopeans—Ramsey

qrowth problem with identical nonoverlapping generations, but here the
generational discount factor p determines the long—run marginal product
of capital, as suggested by Samuelson (1965).

It is easiest to salve the planners problem of maximizing (14)
subject to (is) by the method of optimal control (rrow and Kurz, 1970).
4fter changing the order of integration, (14) may be written in the form

ulc (v,t) ]exp[-Stp(s-v)ds]exp[ (S-p)v]dv}exp

l6 W(0) =

(-St)dt.

Equation (16) yields yet another interpretation of the planners objective. W(0)

is

just the discounted integral, over

all

future dates, of a

weighted sum of instantaneous utilities of those currently alive. The
planner applies the individual subjective discount factor S in weighting
the aggregate utility enjoyed on different dates. IR adding up utilities
enjoyed on a given date by agents of different ages, vintage is discounted at the net rate S - p.11

Let (t) denote the costate variable for the problem of maximizing
(16) subject to (1). Then the associated Hamiltanian is written

The criterion (16) may be viewed as a discounted sum of static
'Senthamite" social welfare functions again, see Samuelson (1967),
Observe that even if u(.) is bounded the summands in (16) can be
unbounded if the nenerational discount factor p is sufficiently
large. In general, therefore, an optimal plan need not exist: one
needs to assume that the welfare weight attached to previous generations does not grow 'too quickly" relative to the rate at which
members of those generations die and S. This problem can be avoided
by postulating a finite age n such that F(n) = 1. Existence of an
optimum is assumed in the discussion below.

p. This is what equation (20) states. The case p =

which all individuals have the same consumption level at any point in

The solution to the planning problem is quite general, in that no
special assumptions about the form of the instantaneous utility function
u(.) are required. To make the nature of the solution more transparent,
it is

useful to analyze first a special case. We then show that the main

iaplications of this special case also hold in general.

Differentiation

shows that the coefficient of c(t,t) in (23) is

constant cier time. Thus, aggregate consumption and the consumption of
the newly born are proportional, so that

(24> DC(t)/C(t) =

Dc(t,t)/c(t,t).

Combining (21) and (22), we find that

is identical to the condition that would govern the evolution of

aggregate consumption in the standard Cass—Koopmans—Ramsey
representative—agent planning model with discount rate p.

Equations

(15) and (26) describe the aggregate dynamics implied by

utilitarian planning. These dynamics may be pictured with the aid of
figure 1. Aggregate consumption equals ouput along the UK = 0 locus so
the capital stock is stationary there. On the DC = 0 locus aggregate

consumption is stationary (although individuals consumption levels may
change over time). The system is saddlepoint stable as usual, with a
unique path 55 converging to the steady state equilibrium E*. 55 yields
the optimal initial aggregate consumption level C(0) associated with any
given initial capital stock K(0). The optimal steady—state capital stock
K* is determined by the condition

(27. Y' cK) =

-18—

and thus depends only on the production function and the rate at which
the planner discounts according to age. Optimal steady—state consumption
is of course given by

(28) C* =

((K*).

It is noteworthy that condition (27) is the same as that derived by
Samuelson (1968) in a model where the planner is constrained to pursue a

time—consistent plan. Indeed conditions (20) and (21) also have

rn 4rmrwrn-L
The main results

of the

constant relative risk aversi on case can

be generalized. In particular the steady state described by (27) and

(28) is independent of the instantaneous utility function u(.), and the
consumptions of all cohorts rise or fall inonotonically along the transi—

tion path. While it is no longer possible in general to express the
economy's dynamics in terms of aggregate consumption and the capital
stocks an alternative two—variable representation can be developed.
These assertions are established as follows. Use necessary condition (18) to write c(v,t) as

Equation (32) is identical to the dynamic equation for the costate

rate p.

The phase diagram for the system in r?(t)

and K(t> described by

enuations (31) and (32) is shown in figure 2. Because C(q*) = K*, where
q* is the steady—state value of q, aggregate consumption and the capital
stock converge toward the stationary values C* and K* defined by (27)
and (2B). The qualitative behavior of consumption is the same as in the

constant relative risk aversion case of figure 1, both in the aggregate
and at the cohort level.

IV. Optimal Fiscal Policy
The goal of this section is to show how fiscal policy can be used
to decentralize optimal utilitarian plans in the competitive economy of
section 1. Because the competitive equilibrium without government intervention is efficient1 only lump sum taxes need be used to generate the
optimal plan as a competitive equilibrium. However, the tax an individual pays will in general vary according to his age and calendar
time. To keep the analysis simple we consider only balanced—budget
fiscal policy. Equivalent policies could involve government debt issue,

but this is not discussed explicitly below.

To make the main points it is sufficient to work with a special

case ot the model, that studied by Blancard (1985). It is therefore
assumed once aoain that the instantaneous death probability is a constant p, that the instantaneous utility function is logarithmic, and
that individuals are born with human wealth only. The last paragraphs of
section I discuss individual and aggregate behavior in this case when
there is no government intervention, and the reader may wish to review
them before proceeding.
Given an initial capital stock K(O) ,

the optimal plan generates

paths CK(t) for capital and {C(t)}.3 for aggregate consumption.
These in turn yield paths for the shadow real interest rate r(t) =

'I'EK(t)),

the shadow wage w(t) =

p'YCK(t)]

—

K(t>Y'CK(t)J)4

and the

shadow present value of per capita wage income h(t) (given by (12), and
the same for all agents alive at time t) . To decentralize the optimal

intertemooral allocation, the government must endow each agent at birth
with a transfer stream inducing the desired consumption levels when the

shadow price paths Cr(t)}0 and CW(t))ç3 are expected. Let T(v,t)
denote the transfer payment received by an agent of vintage v at time t,
and let b(v,t) denote the present value of these payments at time t
given the expected real—interest rate path. We will consider fiscal

policies having the property that the qovernments budget is balanced on
each date t4 so that net transfers to the public are zero:

the transfer streams for those alive at t = 0 are announced

by the government, its only remaining choice variables are the transfer

payments to be made to those born on subsequent dates. Suppose these are
chosen in such a way that the budget is balanced on each date (i.e.
(33)

holds)

and

(38) b (t ,t) =

Eh t: + b (00)

Jexp {Str

(s) -p]ds} - h Ct).

The resulting competitive equilibrium will

then

replicate the optimal

plan.
To verify this result, it must be shown that the implied cohort

consumption paths satisfy (20) and (21). (We have already seen that the
correct initial consumption levels will prevail.) By the individual's
Euler equation (8), it will automatically be the case that for t

(39) c(v,t) =

c(v,v>exptttCr(s)-flds,

v

where c(vv) = (&+p)Eh(v)

b(v,v)].

It therefore follows from (38)

that

b(0,0)3exp(r[r(s)-)dsexpE(-p)v].

In the case v < 0, (37) implies that (40) holds for all t 0. Equations
(20) and (21) follow immediately upon differentiation of (40).

For the sake of intuition, it is useful to analyze the balanced—
budget fiscal policy

that supports the steady

state pictured in figure 1

as a competitive equilibrium. ssume, therefore, that the capital stock
is initially at the level K* defined by equation (27).

Let us first ask why K* would generally not be a steady—state
equilibrium without government intervention. To be concrete, take the
case Y' (K*) = p =

(by (12)) and his lifetime consumption path would be flat at

p[Y(K*)

—

Y'(K*)K*].

the level

Asymptotically aggregate consumption would clearly

approach labor's share in national output; and because labor's share is
less than total output, this is inconsistent with goods—market equilibrium in a steady state. In the competitive steady state, Y1(Kc) > 8.

Each cohort's consumption thus rises over time (by (8)) so that aggregate consumption equals the lower level of national output.
Return now to the decentralization problem. Since we are assuming
a steady state, the payment received by an individual depends on age t—v
only, and so may be written as T(t—v). The present value of these payments given the expected path of the real interest rate, b(v,t), may be
written as b(t—v) in the present context. It is assumed as before that

problem of decentralizing the steady state has been solved, it is necessary to check the optimality condition (20> governing the allocation of
consumption among contemporary cohorts. But by the individual Euler
condition (8)

(49) c(t—y)/t = c(t—v)EY' (K*) —

Condition

—c!iv

follows

immediately from the observations that c/t =

Equation (48) allows us to determine whether a newborn agent's
discounted lifetime transfers b(0) will be positive or negative under
optimal fiscal policy. Direct calculation shows that

(50)

b(0>

By (13), however, the steady—state real interest rate in the absence of
fiscal intervention is V' (KC) =

that

+ p(+p) [Kd/Y(Kc)]. It follows from

the government must set b(0) positive if it wishes to maintain

a stationary capital stock K* greater than the laissez—faire level
and must set b(O) negative in the opposite case. In other words, addi—

tional capital accumulation require negative (unfunded) social
security, an unsurprising result in view of those obtained by Diamond
(1965).

Faced at birth with a declining path of transfer payments, each

agent accumulates capital so as to smooth his consumption. By setting

the path of transfers according to (48) the government can equate
aggregate saving to zero.

The foregoing results are underlined by considernq again the
special case p =

(51> b(O)

'. Under

ipK*/(&'+p) =

this temporary assumption, (48) reduces to

pY' (K*)K*/(&+p).

Equation (51) states that the transfer system endows each agent at birth
with the per capita present discounted value of capital's share in
national income so that, by (41), a(O) = h(O) + b(O) =

pY(K*)/U+p).

Individual consumption is flat at pY(K*) , and a declining path of trans-

fers induces a flow demand for capital just equal to flow supply "be-

queathed to the economy by those who die.

V. Conclusion

This paper has studied the problen of time—consistent utilitarian
planning in an economy where individual lifetimes are stochastic.
dynamically consistent optimal allocation is characterized by a generalized version of Samuelson's (1968) 'two—part golden rule". However, the

economy's aggregate dynamics are quite similar to those arising in the
planning models of Cass (1965), Koopmans (1965), and Ramsey (1928)
which postulate homogeneous nonoverlapping generations. Through appropriate lump—sum transfers, the optimal allocation can be realized as

the equilibrium of a competitive economy with actuarially fair annuities.
