Using Heteroscedasticity to Estimate the Returns to Education

JEL No. C30, I20, J31
ABSTRACT
We apply a new estimator to the measurement of the economic returns to education. We control for
endogenous education, unobserved ability and measurement error using only the natural heteroscedasticty
of wages and education attainment. Our prefered estimate, 6.07%, is closer to the OLS estimate but
smaller (and more precise) than the estimates typically reported by studies that use IV. Our results
indicate that the biases generated by unobserved ability and measurement error tend to cancel each other
out as suggested by Griliches (1977). We also present Monte Carlo evidence to show that the finite
sample bias our estimator is small.

1 Introduction
In recent years there has been a resurgence of interest in the measurement of the economic returns to education. The issue is important to both governments and individuals contemplating investment in education
and is clearly a major determinant of individual income. There has also been interest in the topic as a
way of explaining the growing diﬀerences in income between more and less well educated workers (see for
example Katz and Autor, 1999 and Card and Lemieux, 2000). Unfortunately the precise measurement of
the economic returns to education has been plagued by diﬃculties in isolating the causal eﬀect of education
from the joint process of education and income. In this paper we make use of a new estimator to identify
the returns to education using only the natural heteroscedasticity of the data.
Education is almost certainly an endogenous variable not least because individuals seek higher education
in order to boost income. Similarly high ability individuals will tend to earn higher wages controlling for
education level and will probably also attain a higher level of education. Griliches (1977) noted that while
unobserved ability would tend to bias the OLS estimates of the return upwards, measurement error in the
education variable would tend to bias estimates towards zero. He suggested that the biases may actually
cancel out leaving OLS estimates a good guide to the true return to education.
In his survey of the literature Card (2001) notes that the typical response of the literature to the identiﬁcation problem is to use IV with instruments often based on changes in the institutional structure of the
education system.1 Staiger and Stock (1997) argue that many of these studies employ weak instruments,
implying that estimates are even more imprecise than they may ﬁrst appear and often not signiﬁcantly
diﬀerent from the OLS estimate. Similarly Manski and Pepper (2000) obtain upper bounds on the returns
to schooling that are below some IV point estimates, casting doubt on the validity of those estimates.
In this paper we present estimates of the return to education that control for the potential joint endogeneity of education and income using the natural heteroscedasticity of the data. Building on Rigobon (2000),
we show that if we can split the sample into groups that have diﬀerent covariance matrices then, under
reasonable conditions, we can identify the structural parameters. Our estimates are much more precise than
the usual IV estimates. This is because the data exhibits strong heteroscedasticity whereas the IV estimates
are based on instruments that are only weakly correlated with education attainment.
Our estimates of the return to education suggest that it is close in magnitude to the OLS estimates,
lending support to the Griliches (1977) hypothesis. We also show that our results are quite robust and that
the ﬁnite sample bias of the estimator is small. From a methodological point of view, this suggests that
heteroscedasticity can be used more generally to solve the problem of identiﬁcation when omitted variables,
measurement error, and standard simultaneity issues arise in cross-sectional data.
The paper proceeds as follows. In section two we present a discussion of a simpliﬁed version of our
technique by way of illustration. We also present estimates of the returns to education using some of the
standard IV techniques. In section three we present a more realistic version of heteroscedasticity technique
that allows for unobserved ability and measurement error; and it is this version that we take to the data.
We also test the robustness of our estimator, applying it to a second dataset. Section four presents Monte
Carlo simulations of the ﬁnite sample properties of the estimator. Section ﬁve concludes.
1 See DuFlo, 2001, for a recent example. Belzil and Hansen (2002) adopt an alternative approach by using the non-linearity
of the eduction choice function that results from of an intertemporal optimising model to identify the return to education.

2 The identiﬁcation Problem
Consider the model of education returns in (1) where X and Y are vectors consisting of a constant and the
observable characteristics of individual i; εi and ηi are random structural disturbances to (log) wages and
education respectively; and β is the return to education. For future reference we will denote the variances
of the structural disturbances as vε and ν η and we assume (for now) that Cov(εi ,ηi ) = 0.

wagei = βeduci + µ1 Xi + εi

(1)

educi = αwagei + µ2 Yi + ηi

The ﬁrst equation is the standard Mincer (1974) equation which is consistent with viewing education as the
accumulation of human capital or as the process of signaling innate ability. The second equation reﬂects the
potential endogeneity of education attainment i.e. individuals may seek higher education in anticipation of
resulting higher wages. This speciﬁcation, while a simplistic description of actual behaviour does capture
the possibility that education and wages may be simultaneously related.2
Note that the model of equation (1) excludes the possibility that unobserved ability may aﬀect both
education attainment and market wage and also the possibility that the variables are measured with error.
We make these simplifying assumptions solely in order to illustrate our identiﬁcation technique. The model
that we take to the data in the next section controls for unobserved individual eﬀects and measurement
error.
The the covariance matrix Ω of the reduced form residuals will be given by

The problem of identiﬁcation is that the reduced form covariance matrix — which we can always estimate —
provides us with three equations in four unknowns (ν ε , ν η ,α, β). As is well known, OLS applied to (1) will
lead to biased estimates if α = 0. The usual approach is ﬁnd some instrumental variable i.e. some element
of Y that is not in X and is uncorrelated with εi .
Table 2 shows the results of OLS and IV estimation of model (1) for men using the UK Labour Force
Survey (1993-2000).3 We measure schooling in terms of years in school (as opposed to credentials attained)
and wage as the log of usual gross hourly earnings and the data is pooled across all the years.4 All the
regressions include the usual demographic controls (age, squared, marital status, union membership) and
region and year dummies.
As can be seen from the ﬁrst column, the return to education as measured by OLS is 6.8% which in line
with other estimates for the UK (see Card, 2001). The second column shows the results when we instrument
using the quarter of birth interacted with year, as in Angrist and Krueger (1991). The estimate of 5.2% is
2 Hogan and Walker (2002) present a model of intertemporal education choice that allows for uncertainty in the return to
education. They show that the resulting education choice function is highly non-linear — even for simple primative functions.
3 Excluding women from the sample allows us to abstract from the issue of labour market participation. We also excluded
self-employed, non-prime-aged, and those for whom hours of work or wages were missing.

the OLS estimate, but not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from it.
[Tables 1 and 2 here]
The lack of precision of IV estimates of the return to education is not unusual. In fact most of the
studies surveyed by Card (2001) present IV estimates of the return to education that are not signiﬁcantly
diﬀerent from the OLS estimates.5 Furthermore as Staiger and Stock (1997) show, the degree of imprecision
is greater than suggested by the IV standard errors. They show that when the F − test from a regression of
the endogenous variables on the instruments is less than 5, the instruments are weak and the IV estimates
and conﬁdence intervals are biased even in large samples. Clearly this is true of our example.6 Manski
and Pepper (2000) calculate upper bounds for the true return to schooling and show that, in general, IV
point estimates are very close to the upper bound and sometimes even above it. This suggest that some IV
estimates can be biased upwards.
As an alternative to IV, we make use of the “Identiﬁcation Through Heteroscedasticity” (IH) procedure.7
The idea is that we split the data into at least two groups that have diﬀerent reduced form covariance
matrices.8

across groups, we now have six equations in exactly six unknowns (ν 0ε , ν 0η ,ν 1ε , ν 1η ,α, β), which we can solve
for α and β.
After some algebraic manipulation to eliminate the structural variance terms, the system reduces to (2);

See especially Table 2 of Card (2001).
IV estimates have been criticised on other grounds also. For example, quarter of birth will not be exogenous if it reﬂects
family planning decisions which in turn may be correlated with parental background and family level unobservables (see Card,
2001).
7 We present only an intuitive justiﬁcation of the estimator here. The interested reader is referred to Rigobon (2000) for a
formal discussion. The ﬁrst reference to identiﬁcation using changes in second moments is by Sewell Wright in the appendix
to Philip Wright (1928). Similar techniques have been applied by several authors: King et. al. (1994); Sentana and Fiorentini
(2001); Klein and Vella (2000a,b); Rigobon and Sack (2002).
8 Note that we include group dummies in both equations (in the matrices X and Y ) so we are not using grour as an instrument
in the usual sense. We are relying on changes in the variance (not the mean) of the residuals to identify the model.

We can see from (2) that this estimator is numerically identical to the OLS estimator when education is
exogenous (i.e. α = 0).
It is worth emphasising what exactly is needed in order to achieve identiﬁcation in this example. The
condition that number equations equals number of parameters is equivalent to an order condition. Rigobon
(2000) shows that the necessary and suﬃcient (rank) condition for consistency is that the two reduced form
covariance matrices are linearly independent.9 We also need the assumption that the coeﬃcients on the
endogenous variables do not vary across groups — a restriction that we can relax in an overidentiﬁed model.
Under these circumstances we can be sure that the observed heteroscedasticity of the reduced form (for
which we can test directly) must be due to heteroscedasticity in the structural form.
These considerations place some restrictions on how the sample can be split. For example, we might
ﬁnd that the variance of the reduced form was diﬀerent for men and for women. We could not however,
use this to identify the model as we do not believe that the returns to education are the same for men and
for women. On the other hand, one could argue, for example, that the diﬀering eﬀects macroeconomic and
industry speciﬁc shocks across regions would make the structural wage shock heteroscedastic while leaving
the endogenous coeﬃcients (representing the marginal eﬀects of shocks) constant across regions.
One might expect that the methodology is very sensitive to the precise deﬁnition of the groups. In fact the
model is quite robust to changes in the deﬁnition of the sample split. The estimates will still be consistent
even if the sample split does not perfectly capture the variation in the structural shocks throughout the
sample. For example, if the true diﬀerence in the covariance is between the south and the north, a London
vs. non-London split will still give consistent (but less eﬃcient) estimates. Only if the sample split is
completely wrong, will the estimator be inconsistent (e.g. if the true split is north-south but we choose
east-west). In this case the estimated covariance matrices will be multiples of each other and the systems of
equations will loose rank.
While the sample split need not be perfect, equally it cannot be completely arbitrary. It must have
economic content i.e. it must be possible to believe that structural shocks are heteroscedastic across groups.
If the sample split were entirely arbitrary, the covariance matrices would be linearly related and the model
would fail the rank condition.
We can test for this, in much the same way as we would test a linear system of equations for full rank,
conditional on satisfying the order condition. For our estimator, the sample split allows us to satisfy the
order condition (there are at least as many equations as unknowns). Once this requirement is met, we can
test the rank condition by simply checking if the equations are independent.
One way to ﬁx our intuition of the IH estimator is to think of it as a “probabilistic IV”. With standard
IV we ﬁnd some variable that will shift the education choice curve without aﬀecting the position of wage
curve, allowing us to trace out the wage curve (some policy reform for example). The intuition is similar for
the IH estimator. Provided the covariance matrices are diﬀerent across groups (and the coeﬃcients on the
endogenous variables are constant across groups), we know that for one group the variance in the structural
education shock must be greater than for the other. Thus the cloud of disturbances will be elongated along
the wage curve for that group relative to the other. In other words, an increase in the variance of education

the reduced form covariance matrices have been consistently estimated from the data.

trace out the wage curve.10

3 Unobserved Ability and Measurement Error
We now extend the model of the previous section to the more realistic case where there is unobserved
individual ability which may aﬀect both education attainment and wage conditional on education and also
where some or all of the variables may be measured with error. This is the version of the estimator that
we take to the data. We also make use of variation in the data to over-identify the model and to test the
robustness of the identiﬁcation.
The model of education now becomes (3) where Zi is the unobserved ability of person i, educi is now
interpreted as observed education which diﬀers from true education by the (mean zero) random variable, ui.
All other variables are the same as before and the coeﬃcient on unobserved ability in the education equation
is normalised to unity.

wagei = βeduci + µ1 Xi + γZi − βui + εi
educi = αwagei + µ2 Yi + Zi + ui + ηi

(3)

The addition of the unobserved disturbances complicates the analysis. Following much of the education
literature we interpret Z here as being unobserved ability, but it clearly could represent any source of
correlation in the structural unobservables.
It will become clear that our procedure can control for measurement errors in the wage (or any other)
variable. We focus on measurement error in the education variable because it is particularly important in
our application for two reasons. Firstly, errors are likely to arise in the education variable for reasons other
than the usual coding and reporting errors. Education, when measured by time in school, will contain errors
because the mapping from time in education to human capital is not uniform across persons. For example,
most people take four years to complete a bachelor’s degree, but some do it in three years and some take
ﬁve.11 So observed time in school will be a noisy signal of human capital. Secondly, it has been suggested
since Griliches (1977) that the bias induced in OLS estimates by the errors in the education variable may
oﬀset the bias induced by the presence of unobserved ability.
A suﬃcient condition for identiﬁcation of equation (3) is that the variance of the common shocks (Z and
u) are constant across all groups, and we can identify enough groups. To see this, calculate Ωr the reduced
10 Our procedure bears some resemblance to Rank Order IV procedure of Vella and Verbeek (1997) and applied by them to
the measurement of the returns to education in Rummery et. al. (1999). They also identify their model on the assumption
that the distribution of the structural errors changes across groups. However, their method diﬀers from ours in so far as they
explicitly estimate the distribution functions of residuals in each group, by approximating them by linear functions. They then
get consistent estimates of the model by comparing individuals from the two groups at similar positions in their respective
distributions (i.e. at the same rank). It seems likely that the two methods will give similar answers when there are many
observations and the distributions are approximately normal. However, our method avoids making any parametric assumptions
about the distribution of the structural errors. It is suﬃcient that second moments exist and that they are linearly independent
across groups — relatively weak conditions.
11 This raises the possibility that u is correlated with Z . We can simply include another common shock in (3) to account

As it stands, with all observations in one group, the model is not identiﬁed as the covariance matrix provides
three equations in seven unknowns (α,β,γ,ν rε ,ν rη ,ν rz ,ν ru ). If we split the sample, as in the last section,
the model remains unidentiﬁed: each additional group provides a covariance matrix with three additional
equations but also four new parameters (ν rε ,ν rη , ν rz , ν ru).
In order to identify the model we need to impose the further restriction that some of the shocks are
homoscedastic across some of the groups. In what follows, we assume that the common (ability) shock
and the measurement error are both homoscedastic throughout the entire sample i.e. ν rz = ν z ∀ r and
ν ru = ν u ∀ r.12
Now each extra group which we can identify will provide three more equations but with only two new
parameters (ν rε ,ν rη ). Deﬁne Σr = Ωr − Ω where Ω is the covariance matrix for the entire sample; ν x is
represents the variance of a structural shock calculated over the entire sample; and ∆ν x = ν rx − ν x.

Note that Σr has the same form as the covariance matrix from the previous section. Hence, the conditions for
identiﬁcation are the same - i.e. two independent Σr are enough to consistently estimate α and β . Because
the matrices Σr are linear combinations of the estimable Ωr , implying that three independent groups are
suﬃcient to solve the problem of identiﬁcation.

We treat the R equations (5) as a set of moment conditions and apply a GMM estimator with the weighting
matrix determined by the number of individual observations occurring in each cell.13 The standard errors
are computed by sampling (500 draws) from the estimated asymptotic distribution of the reduced form
covariance matrixes.14
It should be clear at this point that we could have included any number of unobservables in equation (3)
to account for any source of structural shocks, measurement error in any variables or any correlation between

variation will be picked up by the region and year dummies in the reduced forms.

14 We have implicitly assumed that each Ωr is distributed independently of the others. This procedure could potentially
underestimate the true standard errors, in the unlikely event that Ωr is negatively correlated across groups. We could explicitly
account for any correlation by using a bootstrap and sampling from the empirical distribution of the residuals, but this was
found to be far too computationally burdensome.

them. Providing we are prepared to believe that all of these shocks are homoscedastic across groups, they
will be diﬀerenced out, and (5) will provide a consistent estimate of α and β . By the same token, however,
we cannot distinguish between the diﬀerence source of shocks i.e. we cannot say whether ability bias is more
important than measurement error. Nevertheless, we can say something about the relative importance of
ability bias and measurement error on the one hand and simultaneous equation bias on the other hand, as
our method provides an estimate of α.
From (5) we can see that the IH estimator works by taking diﬀerences in second moments across groups,
whereas standard IV works by taking diﬀerences in means across the groups. If the wage shock were
homoscedastic we would be unable identify the education equation. Similarly, heteroscedasticity of education
shock allows us to trace out the wage curve, and identify the return to education — homoscedasticity of the
education shock would prevent this. Furthermore, these assumptions of homoscedasticity and parameter
stability are testable in an overidentiﬁed system, which will require more than three groups.
It is worth commenting on the economic, as distinct from the statistical, content of our identifying
restrictions. Firstly, we have not relied on exclusion restrictions for identiﬁcation. So any variable that
may aﬀect the wage is free also to aﬀect education attainment. Secondly, we will allow wage shocks to be
drawn from diﬀerent distributions across space and time. Thus we allow for macroeconomic, regional or
industry level shocks that aﬀect the income distribution diﬀerently in diﬀerent regions and years. Thirdly,
in order to identify the wage equation and β the parameter of interest, we require some heteroscedasticity
of the education shock. The source of this heteroscedasticity is not of direct concern. But it could arise, for
example, if population density was diﬀerent across regions. To the extent that proximity to school was an
important determinant of education, regions that contain both large cities and rural areas would experience a
large variation in education attainment.15 Fourthly, the homoscedasticity of common shocks seems perfectly
reasonable — if they reﬂect ability and measurement error. To believe otherwise is to believe that there is
some region in which there is an unusually high number of low ability individuals and also an unusually
high number of high ability individuals. Finally, as we use region-year groups, assuming that the structural
parameters (α, β,γ ) do not vary across groups is tantamount to assuming that tastes for education and its
marginal beneﬁts are constant across space and time. The former seems reasonable (and is implicitly a
maintained hypothesis of most studies of education returns) but, given Katz and Autor (1999), the later
does not. Because of the high degree of overidentiﬁcation, we will relax this assumption below.
3.1

Results

We apply this model to the UK LFS data for men only. We divide the data into region and time cells. As
there are 18 regions and 8 years in the LFS, this gives us 144 cells — a degree of overidentiﬁcation which
we exploit to test the robustness of the model. We estimate the model in two steps. First, we estimate the
reduced form including the usual demographic control variables, region dummies, year dummies and their
interactions.16 We then apply standard tests of the homoscedasticity of the reduced form residuals that
reject the null hypothesis at all standard signiﬁcance levels.17 This is a necessary but insuﬃcient condition
Rummery et. al. (1999) make the same point.
The results of this ﬁrst step are available from the authors upon request.
17 We regress the squared residuals and their product on dummy variables that deﬁne the groups. F-Tests of zero slopes,
produce test statistics of 2.11 for the wage residual, 5.27 for the education residual and 2.52 for the product of both. The
15

for our identiﬁcation to hold. Note that it also suggests that our estimates of β may be more precise than
our estimates of α, as the heteroscedasticity of the education shock seems stronger.
In the second step, we can calculate the reduced form matrices to give us a system of R = 144 non-linear
simultaneous equations as in (5) which we solve by GMM. The results are shown in Table 3 together with
the summary statistics of the distribution of the estimator calculated by sampling (500 draws) from the
asymptotic distribution of the reduced form covariance matrices. The full density function of the estimate
of β is plotted in ﬁgure 1.
[Table 3 here]
As can be seen, we have only reported the parameters of interest: α and β . The ﬁrst column in Table 3
indicates the results from estimating the impact of wages on education (α) after controlling for ability, and
measurement error. The second column is the estimate of the returns to schooling (β ). The ﬁrst row gives
the point estimate of both parameters. The second and third rows show the mean and standard deviation,
respectively, of the bootstrapped distribution of the estimator. The fourth row presents a quasi t-statistic
for signiﬁcance i.e. the ratio between the point estimate and the standard deviation. The ﬁfth is the 95
percent conﬁdence interval calculated from the 5th and 95th percentiles of the distribution of the estimator.
The next two rows show the extrema of the distribution. Finally, the last row gives the percentage of the
realizations that are negative.
The most striking observation is that estimated return to education (β ) is much smaller than typically
estimated in studies implementing IV estimators. In fact the IH estimate is close in magnitude to, and
insigniﬁcantly diﬀerent from, the OLS estimate in Table 2 (p − value of 0.29). Our estimate seems to
support the result of Angrist and Krueger (1991) that the return to education is quite small.
We can easily reject the hypothesis that the estimated return is insigniﬁcant from the reported t-statistics.
It is also informative to observe the mass of realizations below zero, which we can interpret as the p-value
of a test of parameter signiﬁcance.18 Furthermore we can establish that the 95% conﬁdence interval for β
is [4.68%, 7.01%]; again in line with OLS estimates but well below (and much more precise than) most IV
estimates. This provides evidence in support of the hypothesis of Griliches (1997) that measurement error
and ability bias approximately cancel out, leaving OLS estimates close to the true value in practice.
Note also that our bootstrap procedure is implicitly checking the rank condition i.e. the linear independence of structural covariance matrices. If the system had been underidentiﬁed then there would have been
a continuum of solutions to (5). Thus, the standard deviations computed from the bootstrap would have
been very large.
We also have an estimate of α, the education choice coeﬃcient. Most studies of the return to education
do not identify α, but an estimate of it comes naturally here. It is less precisely estimated than β , is
insigniﬁcant and, perhaps surprisingly, negative. Clearly the true process by which individuals make their
choices in education is much more complicated than the simple linear model assumed here, so we should be
cautious in interpreting this estimate. Nevertheless the negative point estimate and the overall insigniﬁcance
have interesting implications. Firstly, the negative point estimates suggest that income eﬀects dominate
critical value of F (143, 70943) is 1.29 at the 1% signiﬁcance level.
18 It is possible that quaisi t-test could be missleading if, for example, the distributions were not normal and had large standard
errors, but no realizations on one side of zero.

substitution eﬀects. However, this is not unreasonable as it may appear once we realise that the result is
conditional on the level of ability. In other words, controlling for an individual’s innate ability, giving her
a higher wage may well induce her to leave school earlier. This result suggests that education may be a
substitute for, rather than a complement to, ability. Secondly, the fact that we cannot reject the hypothesis
that α = 0 suggests that simultaneity is not the most important source of bias in the OLS estimate of the
return to education. Further exploration of these issues would be interesting topics for future research.
3.2

Robustness

We can use the degree of overidentiﬁcation to relax some of the identifying assumptions. Speciﬁcally, we can
allow the return to education to be diﬀerent in each of the eight years spanned by the data, and allow both
common shocks (Zi and ui ) to be heteroscedastic across years, but homoscedastic among regions. This is
equivalent to estimating the model separately for each year.
In Table 4 we report the estimates of the returns to education generated by this exercise, where we use
the same method as above to generate the distribution of the estimator. We report only the estimates of
β and the summary statistics of the bootstrapped distribution of the estimator for each year, in the same
manner as Table 3.
Not surprisingly these results are less precise than those in Table 3. For all years other than 1998 and
1999, we can reject the hypothesis the true return to education is zero. The point estimates, however, are not
signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the estimate using all the data. Although, as can be seen there is some variation
in the returns to education over time.
[Table 4 here]
Figure 2 graphs the point estimate of β over time together with the two standard error bands. Notice
that the hypothesis that all the estimates are equal to the estimate using all cells cannot be rejected — lending
support to the overidentifying restrictions.
[Figure 2 here]
We also apply our estimator to another dataset, namely the UK Family Expenditure Survey (FES),
originally used by Harmon and Walker (1995). In Table 5 we report the results of OLS, IV and IH estimation
of the returns to education.19 The IH estimate (using 324 region-time cells) is less than IV but now it is
signiﬁcantly diﬀerent than the OLS estimate (p − value 0.056). Again this is in line with Griliches (1977)
conjecture.
The IH estimate of the return to education is also lower using the FES than using the LFS. This may
be explained by longer sample period covered FES. Figure 3 shows the IH estimate of the return over time
using the FES. The annual returns are not estimated precisely, reﬂecting the small cell size. As we can see
from a comparison of Figure 2 and Figure 3, the return over the period 1993-1995 estimated using the FES
19 Our IV estimate is lower than in the original Harmon and Walker (1995) study and consequently not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent
from the OLS estimate. This probably reﬂects the fact that the sample we use (1978-1995) is later than theirs (1978-1986) and
so contains proportionately less individuals aﬀected by the change in the school leaving law. When we use a sample covering
the same period, our IV estimate is 11.35 with a standard error of 3.11, which is closer to theirs.

is not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from that estimated using LFS. Thus the smaller overall estimate of the return
to education from FES compared to LFS (4.45% vs. 6.07%) appears to be caused by a weak upward trend
in the return to education during the 1990s. Similarly for FES, β̂ IH is less than β̂ OLS . For brevity we do
not report detailed results for α, but its point estimate is negative and insigniﬁcantly diﬀerent from zero.

4 Finite Sample Properties of the IH Estimator
We present Monte Carlo simulations of the ﬁnite sample performance of this estimator and compare it with
the OLS estimator. We show that the IH estimator is not only unbiased but is estimated with precision. The
details are contained in the appendix, we summarize the process and results here. In order to reduce the
dimensionality of the problem we concentrate only on one omitted variable bias, which could be interpreted
either as the unobservable ability or the measurement error.
We start the simulation process by choosing arbitrary but plausible values for the structural parameters
i.e. α, β , and γ in equation (3). For each combination of the “true” structural parameters, we generate 100
diﬀerent artiﬁcial datasets that have second moment properties similar to the real (LFS) data so that the
OLS estimates are all (asymptotically) identical.
In other words, for each set of parameters (α, β , and γ ) we choose (ν rε , ν rη , ν z ) so that (i) the overall
(unconditional) covariance matrix to equal the overall (unconditional) covariance matrix of the real data
(Ω); (ii) the individual heteroscedastic variances (ν rε , ν rη ) match, roughly, the conditional reduced form
heteroscedasticity (Ωr ) observed in the LFS data. Using these parameters, we generate samples of 500
observations for each region-time group (500 being the average cell size in the LFS). Hence, for each cell we
compute a “small sample” covariance matrix that has unconditional variance similar to the LFS data, and
conditional variation across groups also consistent with the data. We repeat this procedure 100 times. We
then apply the OLS and IH estimators to each artiﬁcial dataset and report their distributions relative to the
true values of the parameters.
When we conducted the simulation we allowed β to take on values between 0.05 and 0.225 which more
or less covers the range of returns to education reported in the literature.20 Lacking any concrete idea as to
what the value of α should be, we simply allowed it to take on values from −5 to +5. Similarly, we have no
strong priors on γ , we allow it to take on values in the interval −1 to 2.21
Figures 4 and 5 illustrate these results graphically for β, the return to education parameter.22 In both,
the true value of the parameter is denoted by the height of the light grey bar, with each bar representing a
diﬀerent structural form, i.e. a diﬀerent combination of α, β and γ . In ﬁgure 4 the corresponding value of the
OLS estimator is denoted by the black dot, with the vertical black bar denoting the 95 percent conﬁdence
interval of the distribution of the OLS estimates over the 100 data sets. Clearly, the OLS estimator is
extremely biased changing very little even as the structural form changes dramatically. In fact the OLS
estimates are almost identical across all the artiﬁcial datasets. This is the case (almost) by construction as
we created these datasets so that they would all have second moments close to the true data. Asymptotically
See table 2 of Card (2001), for a summary of the results of 11 major studies of returns to education using IV methods.
Notice that the errors in variable problem is a special case in this simulation - i.e. when γ = −β .
22 We present only a graphical summary of the results on the Monte Carlo simulation. An appendix presenting the detailed
results is available upon request.

the OLS estimator should be identical in all simulations.
In contrast ﬁgure 5 shows that the IH estimator is close to the true value and estimated, largely with
high precision. The exceptions represent those α, β , and γ combinations where the rank condition is close
to failure. The IH point estimate is denoted by the horizontal line, with the vertical black line indicating
the spread of the distribution of IH estimate i.e. the 95 percent conﬁdence interval. Note that the small
sample biases is negligible for small values of the true β . For larger values the bias is usually negative, but
still small.
[Figures 4 and 5 here]
Note that in our simulations the IH estimates will be statistically diﬀerent from OLS for true values of β
that are suﬃciently far from the OLS estimates - basically, IH tracks the true coeﬃcient better than OLS.
From a methodological point of view, this suggests that heteroscedasticity can be used to solve problem of
identiﬁcation when omitted variables, measurement error, and standard simultaneity issues arise in crosssectional data.

5 Conclusions
In this paper we estimated the returns to education controlling for the endogeneity of education, unobserved
ability an measurement error, using only the natural heteroscedasticity observed in the data. In essence the
“Identiﬁcation through Heteroscedasticity” (IH) estimator uses the random shocks to perform a role similar
to standard instruments, generating an exogenous change in one variable allowing us to identify the eﬀect
on the other. Unlike, IV however, the IH method does not rely on exclusion restrictions nor on the use of
natural experiments.
We applied the method to Labour Force Survey data from the UK and showed that the return to education
over the sample period was approximately 6.1% for men. This estimate is close in magnitude to the OLS
(6.8%) and much more precise than the returns estimated by the usual IV techniques. This could be due to
the fact that IV estimate usually utilise natural experiments that fall foul of the “weak instruments” critique
of Staiger and Stock (1997) whereas the IH estimator performs better because it makes use of the naturally
strong heteroscedasticity in the data.
The closeness of the OLS and IH estimates suggests that the biases induced by unobserved ability and
measurement error appear to oﬀset each other. This lends support to the hypothesis of Griliches (1977).
We also noted that standard simultaneity between wage and education (once we control for ability) did not
appear to be important. We checked the robustness of our method by applying it to an alternative dataset
(UK Family Expenditure Survey). The results were quite similar to those for the Labour Force Survey.
We also presented Monte Carlo simulations to show that the ﬁnite sample bias of the IH estimator is
small. Furthermore, the Monte Carlo exercise shows that the IH estimator is not biased towards the OLS
estimate, indicating that the closeness between the IH and the OLS estimates in not the result of small
sample bias.
In our particular application, we required the structural model to be linear, parameters to be stable, and
some of the shocks to be homoscedastic. In principle, the IH estimator can be extended to allow for the
possible heterogeneity of returns across individuals, and also to account for the discrete nature of education
11

choices. This is beyond the scope of the present paper and left for future research. Finally, our results
suggest that Identiﬁcation Through Heteroscedasticity is viable alternative strategy for the solution of the
identiﬁcation problem in the presence of omitted variables, measurement errors, and simultaneity.

A Monte Carlo Simulations
To begin the simulation re-write expression (4) for Ω in vector form as (6). Note that absence of a the

Equation (6) implies that for each combination of parameters α, β , and γ there exists a unique set of variances
of the structural shocks (over all cells aggregated together) that match the covariance matrix of the reduced
form.
For each combination of parameters α, β, and γ , the simulation proceeds as follows:
1. Calculate the feasible set of structural variances. For every combination of parameters {α, β,γ } we solve
(6) for the vector of structural variances {ν ε, ν η , ν z } where {ω11 , ω12 , ω22 } are taken from the reduced
form covariance matrix of the actual (LFS) data. If any of the variances in {ν ε ,ν η , ν z } is negative
or if the matrix A is not invertible for a particular combination of {α, β,γ } then that combination is
inconsistent with the original data and is excluded from further consideration.

that these variances are themselves parameters that are distributed normally

distribution of ν rε , ν rη has thicker tails than the normal distribution. As the IH estimator works oﬀ diﬀerences in variances,
using the normal rather than actual distribution, biases the procedure against the IH estimator. When we implemented this
procedure the IH estimates were even less biased than reported in the text.

the covariance matrix of these residuals. By construction, these will be close to the covariance matrices
of the real data — but not identical due to the randomisation process in step 3.
5. The ﬁnal step is to compute the OLS and IH estimators on the artiﬁcial data.
The process (steps 1-5) is repeated 100 times for each set of parameters {α,β,γ } and we report the
summary statistics for the distribution of the estimators.
