HOW

JOB SECURITY AND VORX FORCE ADJUSTMENT:
DIFFERENT ARE U.S. MiD JAPANESE PRACTICES?

ABS IIACT

This

paper compares employment and hours adjustment in Japanese and

U.S. manufacturing.

In contrast to some previous work, we find that

adjustment of total labor input to demand changes is significantly greater
in the United States than in Japan; adjustment of employment is
significantly greater in the United States, while that of average hours is
about the sane in the two countries.

Although workers in Japan enjoy

greater employment stability than do U.S. workers, we find considerable
variability in the adjustment patterns across groups within each country.

In the United States, most of the adjustment is bone by production workers.
In Japan, female workers, in particular, bear a disproportionate share of
adjustment.

Introduction

Severe macroeconomic recessions, trade pressures and industrial
restructuring have created tensions between American management, which wants
to reduce work force levels and increase productivity, and Anerican labor,
which wants greater job security.

Many in the United States have pointed to

Japan, with its success in trade, its high labor productivity, and its
relatively strong job security, as a model to follow in reforming U.S. labor
relations.

White Japanese workers generally are perceived as having greater job
security than U.S.

workers, job security can be achieved in different ways.

Firms may simply keep excess workers on the payroll during a downturn, even
though doing so reduces their short term profits, if they believe that there
are long run advantages to such a strategy.

Such advantages might include

the retention of highly skilled workers or better labor relations.

Alternatively, a firm may provide employment security for its work force
without sacrificing short term profits if workers as a group are willing to
accept flexible hours and/or flexible compensation.

Finally, a company may

offer employment security for a core group of employees without giving up
labor cost flexibility by using subcontractors or temporary workers as a
buffer.

In this case, greater stability of employment for some translates

into less stability for others.

All three approaches have been seen as an

integral part of Japanese industrial relations.

The relative importance of

each of these strategies has clear implications for how the costs of
adjustment are distributed in society.

twD sets of issues.

Our empirical work addresses

We look first at the overall elasticities of

employment, average hours and total hours with respect to changes in demand
in the two countries

A key question in this part of the analysis is

whether, in Japan. total labor input adjusts less than in the United States
or whether greater flexibility in hours compensates for lower employment
elasticities.
The

second set of questions that we address concerns differences in

adjustment patterns across groups of workers within countries.

To the

extent that labor input is adjusted to changes in demand, are some groups
within each country disproportionately affected? If so, are these groups
the same in the

United

States as in Japan? And is the degree to which the

employment of particular groups responds to changes in demand similar in the
two countries?

A number of Japanese and Aaerican researchers have studied employment

and hours adjustment in the two countries using both aggregate and industry

dataJ

While, to our knowledge, all have found slower adjustment of

overall employment levels in Japan than in the United States, there is
conflicting evidence concerning the adjustment of total hours.

The

prevailing wisdom seems to have been that, in Japan, hours worked are

sufficiently responsive to changes in output that hours adjustment largely
compensates for the lack of employment adjustment. Shinozuka and Ishthara

in Japan. the adjustment of total labor input in the two countries is about

and European countries, concludes that while Japan has the lowest adjustment

In

adopted in previous work, we present evidence that both employment and total

than in

Japanese manufacturing and that adjustment of average production worker
hours is about the same in the two countries.
In analyzing the distribution of the burden of adjustment across groups
of workers within each country, we make three comparisons.

For both the

United States and Japan, we compare adjustment patterns by broad
occupational category (production versus nonproduction workers) and by sex.

In addition, for Japan only, we look at differences in adjustment by
establishment size.2

The greater responsiveness of production than

of nonproduction employment in the United States is a well established fact
that has been explained on the basis of these economic factors.

Our results

indicate that production employment elasticities also exceed nonproduction
employment elasticities in Japan, but that the difference between the two
groups is much smaller than that in the United States.

Because turnover rates are typically higher for women than for men, we
would

expect greater employment elasticities for women in both countries.

In addition, female employment may adjust more than male employment if women

as a group have weaker job rights and are more vulnerable to layoff or
contract termination than men.

not include day laborers. In 1984, day laborers accounted for about two

While the U.S. and the Japanese surveys are otherwise quite similar in
concept, there is an important difference in the quality of the employment
data derived from them.

In the United States, month to month movements in

all of the employment series we have used are generated using the "link
relative" method, which exploits information on the percentage change in
employment in establishments that report their employment in both months,
and the series are rebenchmarked to population totals annually.

paper.

We do not, however, believe it poses a serious problem for our

estimates.

For a number of disaggregated manufacturing industries the

weight given to manhours in the construction of the production index is
negligible.

In the equations that we fit for disaggregated manufacturing

industries, the findings concerning cross-country differences in adjustment
are not sensitive to the degree to which manhours were used in constructing
the

Federal Reserve Board production index.

The corresponding Japanese series, the Industrial Production Index, is
constructed by MITI based on reports from random samples of firms in a

variety of market segments concerning their production of several thousand
commodities.

IV. Esoirical Results

The first part of our empirical work contrasts the overall pattern of
employment and hours adjustment in U.S. and Japanese manufacturing.

The

second part focuses on differences in employment and hours adjustment across

groups within each country, and addresses the question of whether a

disproportionate share of the burden of adjustment is borne by certain
groups in society.
Production Structure and Deaand in U.S.

and

Jaoan.se Manufacturing

Our central objective in this study is to learn about the effects of
the U.S. and Japanese industrial relations systems on employment and hours
adjustment.

This effort is complicated by the fact that, as noted above,

different production structures and different expectations concerning future
demand across the two countries might also lead to differences in the
12

pattern of employment and hours adjustment.

Thus, an important question

that we must consider before proceeding further is whether U.S. and Japanese
employers have been operating in a sufficiently similar environment that
observed differences in the responsiveness of employment and hours to
changes in demand can be interpreted as telling us something about the
operation of the two countries' labor market institutions rather than about
differences in the structure of production or differences in expectations
concerning future demand.

Our major concern with respect to the structure of production was
whether differences in the adjustment of aggregate manufacturing labor input
to changes in aggregate manufacturing output between the United States and
Japan might reflect differences in the composition of the manufacturing base
in the two countries.

Although in this paper we report only estimated

employment and hours elasticities for manufacturing as a whole, as noted
earlier, we have also estimated similar equations for fifteen disaggregated
manufacturing industries.

The fact that these estimates display patterns

very similar to those for manufacturing as a whole suggests that differences
in the structure of production between the United States and Japan do not
explain our findings for manufacturing as a whole.

We were also concerned that differences in the demand conditions
prevailing in U.S. and Japanese manufacturing might influence our results.
In particular, we feared that stronger long term demand prospects might have

lead Japanese employers to adjust labor input less in response to short ten
perturbations in sales.

Table 1 presents measures of growth and cyclicality

in the two countries' manufacturing output during the full 1970-85 period

13

and during the two subperiods 1970-77 and 197885.15

From 1970 to 1977,

trend growth in manufacturing production was quite similar in Japan and the
United States and the variability of production was actually somewhat
greater in Japan.

However, during the 1978-85 period, manufacturing output

grew much more rapidly in Japan than in the United States, and the
variability of manufacturing production around its trend was substantially
smaller in Japan.

These differences are also apparent, though in muted

toni, in the data for the full 1970-85 period.

Thus, looking at data for

the 1970-77 period, when demand conditions in the two countries were
relatively comparable, is one way of checking any conclusions concerning the
effects of differences in the two countries' industrial relations systems
drawn from analyses for periods that include the late 1970's and early
1980's, when demand conditions were less comparable.

The fact that our

results are very similar for all three time periods we examine gives us
confidence that the qualitative U.S./Japanese differences we observe reflect
differences in the two countries' industrial relations systems, not
differences in prevailing demand conditions.

Estimates of one, three, six, and twelve

month elasticities are presented for total employment, production
employment, average production worker hours, and total production worker
hours.

The pattern of both total employment and production employment
adjustment is strikingly different in the two countries.

In the estimates

for all three time periods, U.S. manufacturing employment responds quickly
and substantially to changes in production, whereas in Japan there is little
adjustment until six to twelve months after the change.

Moreover, the

magnitude of both total employment adjustment and production employment
adjustment is significantly greater in the United States than in Japan over
all time horizons)-6

The adjustment of average production worker hours is, in contrast,
quite similar in the two countries.

In both the United States and Japan,

there is a large and immediate response of average hours to changes in
production, and none of the estimated average hours elasticities are
significantly different across the two countries.

As noted above, however,

the hours data for the United States aeasure paid hours, while the hours
data for Japan measure actual hours worked.

One might expect the adjustment

of actual hours to changes in production to be greater than that of paid
hours.

For example, employers may be able to schedule vacation time during

slack periods, in which case actual hours worked would adjust. but paid

Statements concerning the significance of U.S. -Japanese differences
are based on Wald tests, with the test statistic computed as the difference
between the estimated elasticities for the two countries, divided by the
square root of the sum of the variances of these elasticities.

hours would not.

Although we do not know the empirical importance of the

difference in definition, we can conclude that average hours in Japanese
manufacturing adjust no more, and possibly less, than in American
manufacturing.

Total production worker hours elasticities are without exception
significantly larger in the United States than in Japan.

Again, these

differences are, if anything, understated.
As already noted, demand conditions in U.S. and Japanese manufacturing
were most similar during the 1970-77 subperiod.

During the 1978-85

subperiod, Japanese manufacturing output grew more rapidly and was less
cyclically volatile than in the earlier subperiod, while U.S. manufacturing
output grew less rapidly and was no less cyclically volatile.

The point

estimates of the relevant Table 3 coefficients imply that, during the later
subperiod, U.S. employment and hours generally adjusted somewhat more to
changes in production than during the first part of the 1970's, while
Japanese employment and hours generally adjusted less.11

Thus, the

magnitude of the divergence between the U.S. and the Japanese adjustment
pattern is somewhat sensitive to the period considered.

Importantly,

however, our qualitative findings are not.

The characterization that Japanese industry relies relatively more on
adjustment of average hours while U.S. industry relies relatively more on
employment adjustment is certainly accurate.

For example, from Table 2,

adjustment of production employment levels accounts for about two-thirds of
the total production labor input adjustment over a one month time horizon in
the United States; in Japan, the adjustment of production employment levels
accounts for only about 10 percent of the total production labor input
adjustment over the same time horizon.

Our estimates do not indicate, however, as some researchers have
concluded, that average hours adjustment in Japan compensates for the lack
of employment adjustment.

In both the short and medium run, the adjustment

of total production labor input in Japanese manufacturing is substantially
less than that in American manufacturing.

The results of the preceding section may mask significant variation in
employment and hours adjustment, and corresponding differences in the
stability of employment, across groups within each country.

In the final

part of the analysis, we compare labor adjustment by broad occupational
category and by sex for both the United States and Japan.

In addition, for

Japan we look at differences in employment adjustment by establishment size.
In this section we present only estimates using data for the entire 1970-85

period.

adjustment of average hours rather than of employment.

The production

employment elasticity does increase steadily over longer time horizons, but
the nonproduction employment elasticity remains insignificantly different
from zero.

By three months out, the production employment elasticity is

significantly largor than the nonproduction employment elasticity.

Still, the differentials in employment adjustment between production
and nonproduction workers are much smaller in Japan than those in the United

used seemingly unrelated regression techniques to estimate unconstrained and
constrained versions of the production and nonproduction worker equations.

States.

Interestingly

the elasticity point estimates for production

workers in Japan are insignificantly different from those of nonproduction

workers in theunited States.

Stated somewhat differently, production

workers in Japan enjoy a degree of employment stability that is similar to
that enjoyed by nonproduction workers in the United States.

Male versus Female Adjustment
Given the fact that turnover rates are higher for women than for men,

we would expect to observe greater adjustment of female than of male
employaent in response to changes in demand.

In addition, weaker job rights

for women might translate into greater volatility in female employment.

In the United States, last-in-first-out layoff rules are common even in
nonunion settings.

Because women's job tenure is, on average, shorter than

men's, women may be more vulnerable to being laid off in the event of a

reduction in forcej9
In Japan. the so-called lifetime employment system applies primarily to
regular employees in large and medium sized establishments.20

In 1984, only

80 percent of women employed in manufacturing held regular positions, while

20 percent were employed as "temporary workers" or "day laborerc 21

In

contrast, 97 percent of men employed in manufacturing held regular
positions, with only 3 percent employed as temporary workers or day

laborers.

Women are also underrepresented in large establishments and

Hall (1982).

As noted earlier, the ter. "temporary worker" applies to those
employed for one month to one year and the term "day laborer" applies to
those employed on a daily basis or for a period of less than one month.

of

female employees in manufacturing worked in establishments with 500 or more

employees; 34.0 percent were employed in establishments with fewer than 30
employees.

The corresponding figures for men were 40.5 percent and 23.6

percent22

The fact that Japanese women are less likely than Japanese men

to be employed in regular positions with large employers may mean that they
are more vulnerable to contract termination.

Table 5 reports one, three, six and twelve month employment elasticity
estimates for men and for women in U.S. and Japanese manufacturing.
hours elasticities by sex for Japan are also reported.

Average

In the United States

the female employment elasticities are uniformly greater than the male

employment elasticities, significantly so for the one, three and six month
time horizons.

In the Japanese manufacturing sector, female employment adjustment is
much larger than male employment adjustment, especially beginning with the
three month elasticity.

All male/female differences in the Japanese

employment elasticities are statistically significant.

From three months

onwards, however, the adjustment of male average hours is somewhat larger
than that of female average hours; the six and twelve month differences are
statistically significant.

Therefore, it appears that the lower adjustment

of male employment is partly compensated for by greater adjustment of
average male hours.

The fact that average female hours respond less to

22

The data we use to estimate employment and hours elasticities
exclude day laborers and employees of establishments with fewer than 30
employees. Among manufacturing employees who are either regular or
temporary employees, only 83 percent of women but 98 percent of men are
regular employees
Among manufacturing employees in establishments with 30
or more employees, only 31 percent of wonken but 53 percent of men are

20

changes in demand nay in part reflect the fact that, until 1986, tight legal
restrictions limited overtime work by women.23
Because production and nonproduction worker employment elasticities are
so different in the United States, estimated male/female differentials are
likely to be sensitive to the representation of men and women by occupation.

Unfortunately, the establishment data source we are using does not provide
data on male and female employment separately by occupation.

Information

from other sources, however, suggests that differences in the distribution
of men and women between production and nonproduction jobs are unlikely to
explain our finding of higher employment elasticities for women than for

men.2

The same problem in disentangling the effects of occupation and sex

on labor adjustment exists for Japan. though the fact that production and
nonproduction employment elasticities are more similar makes it less
worrisome 25

Although in Japan female employment adjusts more than male employment,
the employment elasticities reported in Table 5 nonetheless imply that
23 Specifically, women were prohibited from working more than 2 hours

of overtime in any day, 6 hours in any week or 150 hours in any year. We
thank Eiko Shinozuka and Machiko Osawa for bringing this to our attention.
24 Tabulations of the May 1979 Current Population Survey indicate that

a slightly higher proportion of male than of female employees in
manufacturing were employed in production jobs (69.8 percent versus 62.6
percent) where production jobs were defined to include craft, operative.
laborer and service positions. On the basis of broad occupation alone,
then, one would expect male employment elasticities to be higher than female
employment elasticities.

suggests that Japanese women enjoy greater employment stability than either
American men or American women as a group.

An important caveat to this

conclusion, however, is the fact that day laborers, who are
disproportionately female, are excluded from our employment data.

Adjustment by Establishment Size

establishment size for Japan. Many have noted that the lifetime employment

In this case, greater fluctuations in production also would

to directly examine the relation between establishment size and
employment adjustment, we estimated separate employment elasticities for
establisbmencs with 500 or more employees, 100-499 employees. 30-99
employees, and 5-29 employees.

The production variables on the right-hand

side measure percentage changes in production for the entire industry, not

for the individual size class, consequently, differences in employment
adjustment by establishment size may result from differences in the
22

variablility of production by establishment size as veil as differences in
personnel practices.

The results in Table 6 do reveal some differences in employment
adjustment by establishment size.

The distinction appears primarily between

Employment adjustment is generally

greater in the three smaller establishment size classes than in the largest,

although many of the differences between the top size class and the others
are not statistically significnat and the 12 month employment elasticity for
establishments with 5-29 employees is actually less than that for
establishments 500 or more employees.

A comparison of the three smaller

size classes shows that employment elasticities generally decline with
establishment size.

It is interesting to note that the relatively slower

adjustment in the largest establishment size category coincides with the
fact that women are particularly underrepresented in establishments with 500
or more employees.

V. Conclusion
Japanese workers appear to enjoy, on average, considerably greater jab
security than American workers.

employment

Consistent with previous work, we find that

levels in Japanese manufacturing adjust much less to changes in

production than do U.S. employment levels.

Contrary to some previous work,

however, we find that the adjustment of average hours is about the same in
the

two countries.

Consequently, the adjustment of total labor input in the

Japanese manufacturing sector is also significantly less than that in U.S.
manufacturing.

Thus, Japanese hours are not sufficiently flexible to offset

23

any short run costs of providing employment security borne by Japanese
employers.

Weitzman (1984) and Freeman and Weitzman (1987) have suggested that the
bonus system renders compensation considerably more flexible in Japan than
in the

United

States.

The relative responsiveness of total labor costs to

changes in production in the United States and Japan is something that we
plan to examine in future work.

At this point, it would be premature to

conclude that the strong job security characterizing Japanese labor markets
imposes costs on employers even in the short run.

In

addition, Japanese

internal labor markets are often characterized as more flexible than
American internal labor markets, in the sense that Japanese employers have
more freedom to reassign workers within the firm.26

Such flexibility is

likely to enhance productivity and may be viewed as a substitute for
managerial flexibility in hiring and firing.

Although the stability of employment is, on average, greater in Japan
than in the United States, the variation in employment and hours adjustment
across groups of workers within each country is considerable.

In the United

States, the burden of work force adjustment falls primarily on production
workers.

In Japan, differences between production and nonproduction

employment adjustment are relatively small.

Both production and

nonproduction workers enjoy strong employment security compared to
production workers in the United States.

This may be a result of the

changes in industrial relations in Japan after World War II that equalized

social relations between blue and white collar workers.

Such equalization

has never occurred in the United states.2
In Japan. the burden of adjustment to demand shocks is widely believed
to be borne disproportionately by workers in small establishments and by
casual workers, who are predominantly women.

We find only limited support

for the contention that employment adjustment is greater in smaller
establishments.

The differences between the adjustment patterns of mate and

female employees appear to be more important.

Female employment adjusts

much more than male employment, particularly over horizons of three months
or more.

This finding is consistent with the fact that women comprise the

bulk of temporary workers in manufacturing and, secondarily, are
concentrated in the smaller establishments.

In sum, in both the United States and Japan, the degree of employment
security varies widely across groups, resulting In some overlap between the

In the United States, the employment of nonproduction

in practice, roughly as stable as that of overall employment In

Japan.

Yet, in Japan. among the groups we examined, there is no group whose
employment adjusts as much to changes in demand as that of production
workers in the United States.

Although, in Japan. female workers, and, to

some extent, workers in small establishments, do bear a disproportionate
share of the burden of emloyiuent adjustment, employment of these
