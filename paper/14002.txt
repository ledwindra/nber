ABSTRACT
We use the control function approach to identify the average treatment effect and the effect of treatment
on the treated in models with a continuous endogenous regressor whose impact is heterogeneous. We
assume a stochastic polynomial restriction on the form of the heterogeneity but, unlike alternative
nonparametric control function approaches, our approach does not require large support assumptions.

Introduction

There is a large and growing theoretical and empirical literature on models where the impacts
of discrete (usually binary) treatments are heterogeneous in the population.1 The objective of
this paper is to analyze non-parametric identification of treatment effect models with continuous treatments when the treatment intensity is not randomly assigned. This generally leads
to models that are non-separable in the unobservables and produces heterogeneous treatment
intensity effects. Imposing a stochastic polynomial assumption on the heterogeneous effects, we
use a control function approach to obtain identification without large support assumptions. Our
approach has applications in a wide variety of problems, including demand analysis where price
elasticities may differ across individuals; labor supply, where wage effects may be heterogeneous;
or production functions, where the technology may vary across firms.
Other recent papers on semiparametric and nonparametric models with nonseparable error terms and an endogenous, possibly continuous, covariate include papers using quantile
instrumental variable methods such as Chernozhukov and Hansen (2005) and Chernozhukov,
Imbens, and Newey (2007), and papers using a control variate technique such as Altonji and
Matzkin (2005), Blundell and Powell (2004), Chesher (2003), and Imbens and Newey (2002,
2007). Chesher (2007) surveys this literature. The analysis of Imbens and Newey (2002, 2007)
is perhaps the most relevant to our analysis, with the key distinction between our approach
and their approach being a tradeoff between making a stochastic polynomial assumption on
the outcome equation versus assuming large support. We discuss the differences between our
approach and their approach further in Section 3.2.

The Model, Parameters of Interest and the Observables.

Let Yd denote the potential outcome corresponding to level of treatment intensity d. When
the treatments are discrete this notation represents the two possible outcomes for a particular
individual in the treated and non-treated state. In this paper, there are a continuum of alternatives as the treatment intensity varies. Define ϕ(d) = E(Yd ) and Ud = Yd − ϕ(d), so that, by

Yd = ϕ(d) + Ud .

with E(εj ) = 0, j = 0, ..., K,

where K < ∞ is known.2
Let D denote the realized treatment, so that the realized outcome Y is given by Y = YD .
We do not explicitly denote observable regressors that directly affect Yd . All of our analysis
implicitly conditions on such regressors. We assume
(A-1) ϕ(D) is K times differentiable in D (a.s.), and the support of D does not contain any
isolated points (a.s.).
This allows for heterogeneity of a finite set of derivatives of Yd . This specification can be seen
as a nonparametric, higher order generalization of the random coefficient model analyzed by
Heckman and Vytlacil (1998) and Wooldridge (1997, 2003, 2007). The normalization E(εj ) = 0,
j = 0, ..., K, implies that

where ² need not be a scalar random variable. The notation of equation (3) can be mapped into
the notation of equations (1) and (2) by setting εj = hj (²). Notice that do not assume that ² is
a scalar random variable, and h need not be monotonic in ².

different average treatment effect. The average treatment effect is the derivative of the average
structural function of Blundell and Powell (2004).
We also consider the effect of treatment on the treated (TT), given by

which is the average effect of treatment for those currently choosing treatment level d of an incremental increase in the treatment holding their unobservables fixed at baseline values. This parameter corresponds to the local average response parameter considered by Altonji and Matzkin
(2001, 2005).
We denote the choice equation (the assignment mechanism to treatment intensity) as
D = g(Z, V )

(5)

where Z are observed covariates that enter the treatment choice equation but are excluded from
the equation for Yd and V is a scalar unobservable. We make the following assumption:
(A-2) V is absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure; g is strictly monotonically
increasing in V ; and Z ⊥⊥ (V, ε0 , ...εK ).
As long as D is a continuous random variable (conditional on Z), we can always represent
D as a function of Z and a continuous scalar error term, with the function increasing in the
error term and the error term independent of Z. To see this, set V = FD|Z (D|Z) and g(Z, V ) =
−1
FD|Z
(V |Z). Thus, D = g(Z, V ) where g is strictly increasing in the scalar V which is distributed

unit uniform and independent of Z. However, the assumption that g(Z, V ) is monotonic in a
scalar unobservable V with Z ⊥
⊥ (V, ε0 , ...εK ) is restrictive. The construction V = FD|Z (D|Z)
−1
and D = FD|Z
(V |Z) = g(Z, V ) does not guarantee Z ⊥⊥ (V, ε0 , ...εK ).

Given assignment mechanism (5) and assumption (A-2), without loss of generality we can
impose the normalization that V is distributed unit uniform. Given these assumptions and
the normalization of V , we can follow Imbens and Newey (2002, 2007) and recover V from
−1
V = FD|Z (D|Z) and the function g from g(Z, V ) = FD|Z
(V |Z). Assignment mechanism (5) and

assumption (A-2) will not be directly used to prove identification. However, we use it to clarify
the primitives underlying our identification assumptions.

2.1

Education and Wages: A Simple Illustration

To illustrate the type of problem we analyze in this paper, consider a simple model of educational
choice. Suppose that the agent receives wages Yd at direct cost Cd if schooling choice d is made.
We work with discounted annualized earnings flows. We write wages for schooling level d, Yd ,
as
1
Yd = ϕ0 + (ϕ1 + ε1 )d + ϕ2 d2 + ε0
2
and the cost function for schooling as
1
Cd = C0 (Z) + (C1 (Z) + v1 )d + C2 (Z)d2 + v0
2

(6)

where εs and vs (s = 0, 1) are, respectively, unobserved heterogeneity in the wage level and in
the cost of schooling. These unobserved heterogeneity terms are the source of the identification
problem considered in this paper. We impose the normalizations that E(εs ) = 0, E(vs ) = 0, for
s = 0, 1. We implicitly condition on variables such as human capital characteristics that affect
both wages and the costs of schooling. The Z are factors that only affect the cost of schooling,
such as the price of education.
Assume that agents choose their level of education to maximize wages minus costs. Let D
denote the resulting optimal choice of education. D solves the first order condition
(ϕ1 − C1 (Z)) + (ϕ2 − C2 (Z)) D + ε1 − v1 = 0.
Assuming that ϕ2 − C2 (Z) < 0 for all Z, the second order condition for a maximum will be
satisfied. This leads to an education choice equation (assignment to treatment intensity rule)
D=

ϕ1 − C1 (Z) + ε1 − v1
.
C2 (Z) − ϕ2

This choice equation is produced as a special case of the model given by equations (1), (2) and
(5), with
1
ϕ(d) = ϕ0 + ϕ1 d + ϕ2 d2
2
Ud = ε 0 + ε 1 d
(v)
ϕ1 − C1 (z) + Fε−1
1 −v1
g(z, v) =
C2 (z) − ϕ2
where V = Fε1 −v1 (ε1 − v1 ) with Fε1 −v1 the cumulative distribution function of ε1 − v1 . The
goal is to identify the average return to education: ∆AT E (d) = ϕ1 + ϕ2 d, or TT, which is
∆T T (d) = (ϕ1 + E(ε1 |D = d)) + ϕ2 d.
5

In this example, the treatment intensity is given by equation (5) with g strictly increasing
in a scalar error term V = Fε1 −v1 (ε1 − v1 ). The structure of the treatment intensity mechanism is sensitive to alternative specifications. Consider the same example as before, except
now the second derivative of Yd is also stochastic: Yd = ϕ0 + (ϕ1 + ε1 )d + 21 (ϕ2 + ε2 )d2 + ε0 .
The choice equation becomes D =

ϕ1 −C1 (Z)+ε1 −v1
.
C2 (Z)−ϕ2 −ε2

In this case, the structural model makes D

a function of V = (ε1 − v1 , ε2 ), which satisfies Z ⊥
⊥ (V, ε0 , ε1 , ε2 ) but V is not a scalar error.
−1
We can still define Ṽ = FD|Z (D|Z) and the function g̃ by g̃(Z, Ṽ ) = FD|Z
(Ṽ |Z). With this

construction, D is strictly increasing in a scalar error term Ṽ that is independent of Z. However, Z is not independent of (Ṽ , ε0 , ε1 , ε2 ). To see why, note that Pr(Ṽ ≤ v|Z, ε0 , ε1 , ε2 ) =
h
i
¯
ϕ1 −C1 (Z)+ε1 −v1
−1
¯
Pr v1 : C2 (Z)−ϕ2 −ε2 ≤ FD|Z (v) Z, ε0 , ε1 , ε2 6= Pr(Ṽ ≤ v|ε0 , ε1 , ε2 ). This is a case where assumption (A-2) does not hold. The fragility of the specification of equation (5) where g is
strictly increasing in a scalar error term arises in part because, under rational behavior, heterogeneity in response to treatment (heterogeneity in the Yd model) generates heterogeneity in
selection into treatment intensity. This heterogeneity is absent if agents do not know their own
treatment effect heterogeneity, which can happen if agents are uncertain at the time they make
participation decisions (see Abbring and Heckman, 2007).

Identification Analysis.

IV does not identify AT E in the case of binary treatment with heterogeneous impacts (Heckman,
1997; Heckman and Robb, 1986) unless one imposes covariance restrictions between the errors in
the assignment rule and the errors in the structural model. Following Newey and Powell (2003)
and Darolles, Florens, and Renault (2002), consider a nonparametric IV strategy based on the
identifying assumption that E(Y − ϕ(D)|Z) = 0. Suppose K = 0, which is the special case of
no treatment effect heterogeneity. In this case, UD = ε0 so that YD = ϕ(D) + ε0 . We obtain
the standard additive-in-unobservables model considered in the cited papers. The identification
condition is E(ε0 |Z) = 0. However, in the general case of treatment effect heterogeneity (K > 0),
the IV identification restriction implies special covariance restrictions between the error terms.
For example, suppose K = 1 and that D = g(Z) + V . Then E(Y − ϕ(D)|Z) = 0 requires
E(ε0 |Z) = 0 and E(ε1 D|Z) = 0, with the latter restriction generically equivalent to E(ε1 |Z) = 0
and E(ε1 V |Z) = 0. In other words, in addition to the more standard type of condition that
ε0 be mean independent of the instrument, we now have a new restriction in the heterogeneous
6

case that the covariance between the heterogeneous effect and the unobservables in the choice
equation conditional on the instrument does not depend on the instrument.4 Instead of following
an instrumental variables approach, we explore identification through a control function.5 We
assume the existence of a (known or identifiable) control function Ṽ that satisfies the following
conditions:
(A-3) Control Function Condition: E(εj | D, Z) = E(εj |Ṽ ) = rj (Ṽ ).6
and
(A-4) Rank condition: D and Ṽ are measurably separated, i.e., any function of D almost surely
equal to a function of Ṽ must be almost surely equal to a constant.
A necessary condition for assumption (A-4) to hold is that the instruments Z affect D.7 We
return later in this section to consider sufficient conditions on the underlying model that implies
the existence of such a control variate Ṽ . Under these assumptions, ATE and TT are identified.
Theorem 1. Assume equations (1) and (2) hold with finite K ≥ 1. Under assumptions (A-3)
(control function condition), (A-4) (rank condition), and the smoothness and support condition (A-1), ATE and TT are identified.
Proof. See Appendix.
The control function assumption gives the basis for an empirical determination of the relevant
degree of the polynomial in (2). If the true model is defined by a polynomial of degree ` we have
that for any k > `

See Heckman and Vytlacil (2007b) for a discussion of the distinction between control functions and control
variables. Technically “control function” is a more general concept. We adopt the recent nomenclature even
though it is inaccurate. See the Matzkin (2007) paper for additional discussion.

Note that our normalization E(εj ) = 0, j = 0, ..., K, implies the normalization that E(rj (Ṽ )) = 0, j =
0, ..., K,
7
Measurable separability, which we maintain in this paper is just one way of achieving identification. Alternatively, one could restrict the space of functions ϕ(D) not to contain rj (Ṽ ) functions; this in turn can be achieved
for example by assuming that ϕ(D) is linear in D and rj is non-linear as in the Heckman (1979) selection model.

Primitive Conditions Justifying the Control Function Assumption.

In the previous section a control function is assumed to exist and satisfy certain properties.
The analysis in the previous section did not use assignment rule (5) or condition (A-2). In this
section, we use assignment rule (5) and condition (A-2) along with the normalization that V is
distributed unit uniform. Under these conditions, consider using V = FD|Z (D|Z) as the control
function. This leads to the following corollary to Theorem 1:
Corollary 3.1. Assume equations (1) and (2) hold with finite K ≥ 1 and assume smoothness
and support condition (A-1). If D is generated by assignment equation (5) and condition (A-2)
holds, and if V and D are measurably separable, (A-4), then ATE and TT are identified.
In order for the conditions of Theorem 1 to be satisfied it is sufficient to verify that under the
conditions in the corollary the control function assumption (A-3) is satisfied. Given that D
satisfies assignment equation (5) and condition (A-2), from Imbens and Newey (2002, 2007) we
obtain that V = FD|Z (D|Z) is a control variate satisfying assumption (A-3).
Next consider measurable separability condition (A-4). Measurable separability is a relatively
weak condition, as illustrated by the following theorem.
Theorem 2. Assume that (D, V ) has a density with respect to Lebesgue measure in R2 and
denote its support by S and let S 0 be the interior of the support. Further, assume that i) any
point in S 0 has a neighborhood such that the density is strictly positive within it and ii) any two
points within S 0 can be connected by a continuous curve that lies strictly in S 0 . Then measurable
separability between D and V (A-4) holds.
Proof. See Appendix.
Measurable separability is a type of rank condition. To see this, consider the following
heuristic argument. Consider a case where the condition is violated at some point in the interior
of the support of (D, V ), i.e. h(D) = l(V ). Hence h(g(Z, V )) = l(V ). Differentiating both
8

sides of this expression with respect to Z, we obtain
∂h
∂g

6= 0 and hence

∂g
∂Z

∂h ∂g
∂g ∂Z

= 0. If measurable separability fails,

= 0 which means that g does not vary with Z. Note that the conditions

in Theorem 2 are not very restrictive. For example, the conditional support of D can depend
on V and vice versa.
Assignment rule (5) and condition (A-2) do not imply measurable separability (A-4). To
show this, we consider two examples where equation (5) and condition (A-2) hold but D and
V are not measurably separable. In the first example, Z is a discrete random variable. In the
second example, g(z, v) is a discontinuous function of v.
First, suppose Z = 0, 1 and suppose that D = g(z, v) = z + v, with V Unif[0, 1]. Then
(A-4) fails, i.e., D and V are not measurably separable. To see this, let m1 (t) = t and let
m2 (t) = 1[t ≤ 1]t + 1[t > 1](t − 1). Then m1 (V ) = m2 (D), but m1 and m2 are not a.s.
equal to a constant. Now consider a second example. Suppose that D = g1 (z) + g2 (v), where
g2 (t) = 1[t ≤ .5]t + 1[t > .5](1 + t). Let g1max and g1min denote the maximum and minimum
of the support of the distribution of g1 (Z), and suppose that g1max − g1min < 1. Then (A-4)
fails, i.e., D and V are not measurably separable. To see this, let m1 (t) = 1[t ≤ .5], let
m2 (t) = 1[t ≤ .5 + g1max ], and note that m1 (V ) = m2 (D) but that m1 and m2 do not (a.s.) equal
a constant.
Assignment rule (5), condition (A-2), and regularity conditions that require Z to contain
a continuous element and that g be continuous in v are sufficient to imply that measurable
separability (A-4) holds. We prove the following theorem.
Theorem 3. Suppose that D is determined by equation (5). Suppose that g(z, v) is a continuous
function of v. Suppose that, for any fixed v, the support of the distribution of g(Z, v) contains
an open interval. Then, under assumption (A-2), D and V are measurably separated ((A-4)
holds).
Proof. See Appendix.
Note that, for any fixed v, for the support of the distribution of g(Z, v) to contain an open
interval requires that Z contains a continuous element. A sufficient condition for the support
of the distribution of g(Z, v) to contain an open interval is that (a) Z contains an element
whose distribution conditional on the other elements of Z contains an open interval, and (b)
g is a continuous monotonic function of that element. Thus, under the conditions of Theorem
9

3, V is identified by V = F (D|Z) and both the control function condition (A-3) and the rank
condition (A-4) hold with Ṽ = V .

3.2

Alternative Identification Analyses.

A general analysis of identification using the control function assumption without the polynomial
structure is related to the work of Heckman and Vytlacil (2001) on identifying the marginal
treatment effect (MTE). That paper considers a binary treatment model, but their analysis may
be extended to the continuous treatment case. Similar approaches for semiparametric models
with a continuous treatment D that is strictly monotonic in V is pursued for the Average
Structural Function (ASF) by Blundell and Powell (2004) and for the Local Average Response
(LAR) by Altonji and Matzkin (2001, 2005). The derivative of the ASF corresponds to our
ATE, and the LAR corresponds to treatment on the treated.
Most relevant to this note is the analysis of Imbens and Newey (2002, 2007). They invoke
the same structure as we do on the first stage equation for the endogenous regressor as our
assignment mechanism (5) and they also invoke assumption (A-2). The control variate is V ,
with V identified, and with a distribution that can be normalized to be unit uniform. By the
as

same reasoning, we have E(Yd |D = d, V = v) = E(Yd |V = v). Furthermore, they assume
that the support of (D, V ) is the product of the support of the two marginal distributions, i.e.,
they assume rectangular support. Their assumption implies that the conditional support of D
given V does not depend on V (and vice versa). It is stronger than the measurable separability
assumption we previously used to establish identification. From these assumptions it follows
that
E(Y |D = d, V = v) = E(Yd |D = d, V = v) = E(Yd |V = v)
and

Z
E(Yd ) =

Then ϕ(d) =

R

E(Yd |V = v)dF (v).

E(Y |D = d, V = v)dF (v) and is identified. Identification of ϕ(d) in turn

implies identification of ∆AT E =

∂
ϕ(d).
∂d

The rectangular support condition is needed to replace

E(Yd |V = v) by E(Y |D = d, V = v) for all v in the unconditional support of V in the previous
integral. The rectangular support condition may not be satisfied and in general requires a large
support assumption as illustrated by the following example. Suppose D = g1 (Z) + V . Let G1

10

denote the support (Supp) of the distribution of g1 (Z). If Z and V are independent, then
Supp(V |D = d) = Supp(V |g1 (Z) + V = d) = Supp(V |V = d − g1 (Z)) = {d − g : g ∈ G1 }
where the last equality uses the condition that Z ⊥⊥ V . {d − g : g ∈ G1 } does not depend on d
if and only if G1 = <. For example, if G1 = [a, b], then {d − g : g ∈ G1 } = {d − g : g ∈ [a, b]} =
[d − b, d − a] which does not depend on d if and only if a = −∞ and b = ∞, i.e., if and only if
G1 = <.
Instead of imposing E(Yd |D = d, V = v) = E(Yd |V = v), one could instead impose
∂

E(Y |D = d, V = v) = E( Yd |D = d, V = v) = E( Yd |V = v).

instead integrate E( ∂d

This is the identification strategy followed in Heckman and Vytlacil (2001), adapted to the case
where D is a continuous treatment. As discussed in Heckman and Vytlacil (2001), a rectangular
support condition is required in order to integrate up MTE to obtain ATE. Note that one does
not require the rectangular support condition to integrate up

|D = d, V = v) for v in the support of V

conditional on D = d, not in the unconditional support of V .
While a rectangular support condition is not required to integrate MTE to recover TT, a
support condition is required for equation (7) to hold. That equation requires that E(Y |D =
d, V = v) can be differentiated with respect to d while keeping v fixed. This property is closely
related to measurable separability between D and V . Assume that there exists a (differentiable)
function of D, h(D) equal (a.s.) to a function of V, m(V ), which is not constant. Then we
obtain
as

E(Y |D = d, V = v) = E(Yd |V = v) + h(d) − m(V )

which implies that equation (7) is violated. Thus, for TT, we still need measurable separability
between D and V in order for equation (7) to hold.
There are trade-offs between the approach presented in this note versus an approach that
identifies MTE/MTE-like objects and then integrates them to obtain the object of interest. The
approach developed here requires a stochastic polynomial structure on UD of equation (2) and
higher order differentiability. These conditions are not required by Imbens and Newey (2002,
2007) or Heckman and Vytlacil (2001). The approach of this note does not require the large
support assumption required to implement these alternative approaches. As shown by Theorem
2, measurable separability between D and V is a relatively mild restriction on the support
of (D, V ). As shown by Theorem 3, measurable separability between D and V follows from
assignment mechanism (5) and Assumption (A-2) combined with a relatively mild regularity
condition.

Estimation

Under the control function assumption we have:
E(Y |D = d, Z = z) = E(Y |D = d, V = v)
K
X
= ϕ(d) +
dj hj (v) .
j=0

The method we propose is an extension of Newey, Powell and Vella (1999) and may also be viewed
as an extension of estimation of additive models in a nonparametric context. The estimation
is carried out in two steps: first estimate the residual vi from the nonparametric regression
D = E(D|Z) + V ; then estimate ϕ and the hj ’s.
Define the estimation criterion

where D̃ = 1, D, D2 , ..., DK , and h = [h0 , h1 , ..., hK ]0 . The first order conditions for the

This linear system in ϕ and h can easily be solved if the conditional expectations are replaced
by their estimators (by kernels for example). In that case it is easily seen that (9) generates a
linear system with respect to the ϕ(di ) and the hj (vi ) (i = 1, ..., n; j = 0, ..., K) and this system
may be solved by usual methods of linear equations. The equations in (9) are then used to
compute ϕ(d) and hj (v) at any point of evaluation. If we only wish to focus attention on ϕ, the
vector h may be eliminated from (9) and we obtain:

h
i
ϕ(d) − d˜0 E E(D̃D̃0−1 E(ϕ(D)|V = v)|D = d

h
i
= E(Y |D = d) − d˜0 E E(D̃D̃0−1 E(D̃Y |V = v)|D = d .

This equation has the form (I − T )ϕ = ψ where T is, under very general conditions, a compact
operator and ψ may be estimated. It is a Fredholm equation of type II which may be analysed
using the methods in Carrasco, Florens, and Renault (2007, section 7). The original system (9) is
also a Fredholm equation of type II and both systems generate well posed inverse problems. The
asymptotic theory developed in Carrasco, Florens, and Renault (2007) applies with the exception
that the vi are now estimated. A precise analysis of this approach and some applications will
be developed in future work.

Conclusions

This paper considers the identification and estimation of models with a continuous endogenous
regressor and non-separable errors when continuous instruments are available. We present an
identification result using a control function technique. Our analysis imposes a stochastic,
finite-order polynomial restriction on the outcome model but does not impose a large support
assumption.

Proof of Theorem 2
Let (d, v) be a point of the interior of the support S 0 . Let N d denote a neighborhood of d
and N v a neighborhood of v such that N d × N v is included in S 0 . The distribution of (D, V )
restricted to N d × N v is equivalent to Lebesgue measure (i.e. has the same null sets). Then
using Theorem 5.2.7 of Florens, Mouchart, and Rolin (1990) (D, V ) restricted to N d × N v are
14

as

measurably separated. This implies that if within that neighborhood h(D) = l(V ), then h(D)
and l(V ) are a.s. constants. We need to show that this is true everywhere in the interior of
the support. Consider any two points (d, v) and (d0 , v 0 ) in S 0 . The theorem will be true if
h(d) = h(d0 ). As S 0 satisfies the property (ii) in the theorem and is open by definition, there
exists a finite number of overlapping open sets with non-empty overlaps, i.e. ∃ a finite sequence
d
of neighborhoods Njd × Njv , j = 1, ..., J such that each Njd × Njv ⊂ S 0 and Njd ∩ Nj+1
6= ∅ and

similarly for Njv . The first point (d, v) is in N1d × N1v and the second point (d0 , v 0 ) is in NJd × NJv .
Take d1 ∈ N1d and in the next overlapping neighborhood d2 ∈ N2d . From the previous result
(D, V ) are measurably separated on N1d × N1v and on N2d × N2v . Thus h(di ) i = 1, 2 is constant
on each and thus constant on the union implying h(d1 ) = h(d2 ). Iterating in this way along
the sequence of neighborhoods until NJd × NJv , it follows that h(d) = h(d0 ). Hence h(D) is a.s.
as

constant and, because h(D) = l(V ), l(v) is a.s. constant.
¥
Proof of Theorem 3
Let Z denote the support of the distribution of Z. Consider any two functions m1 and m2
such that m1 (D) = m2 (V ) a.s. For (a.e. FV ) fixed v0 , using the assumption that Z and V
are independent, it follows that m1 (g(z, v0 )) = m2 (v0 ) for a.e. z conditional on V = v0 implies
that m1 is (a.s. FZ ) constant on {g(z, v0 ) : z ∈ Z}. Likewise, for a v1 close to v0 , we have
m1 is constant on {g(z, v1 ) : z ∈ Z}. Using the fact that g(z, v) is continuous in v and that
{g(z, v) : z ∈ Z} contains an open interval for any v, we can pick v1 sufficiently close to v0 so
that {g(z, v0 ) : z ∈ Z} and {g(z, v1 ) : z ∈ Z} have a nonnegligible intersection, and we thus
conclude that m1 is constant on {g(z, v) : z ∈ Z, v = v0 , v1 }. Proceeding in this fashion, we
conclude that m1 is (a.s.) constant on {g(z, v) : z ∈ Z, v ∈ [0, 1]}, and thus that m1 is a.s. equal
to a constant. ¥
