Chernobyl's Subclinical Legacy: Prenatal Exposure to Radioactive Fallout and School Outcomes
in Sweden

ABSTRACT
Japanese atomic bomb survivors irradiated 8-25 weeks after ovulation subsequently suffered reduced
IQ [Otake and Schull, 1998]. Whether these findings generalize to low doses (less than 10 mGy) has
not been established. This paper exploits the natural experiment generated by the Chernobyl nuclear
accident in April 1986, which caused a spike in radiation levels in Sweden. In a comprehensive data
set of 562,637 Swedes born 1983-1988, we find that the cohort in utero during the Chernobyl accident
had worse school outcomes than adjacent birth cohorts, and this deterioration was largest for those
exposed approximately 8-25 weeks post conception. Moreover, we find larger damage among students
born in regions that received more fallout: students from the eight most affected municipalities were
3.6 percentage points less likely to qualify to high school as a result of the fallout. Our findings suggest
that fetal exposure to ionizing radiation damages cognitive ability at radiation levels previously considered
safe.

Introduction and Motivation

This paper studies the school performance of Swedish children in utero
during the Chernobyl (Ukraine) nuclear accident on April 26, 1986.
Japanese A-bomb survivors irradiated in utero at post-ovulatory ages
8-25 weeks subsequently suffered reduced IQ: 25-30 points per Gy for
those exposed at post-ovulatory ages 8-15 weeks [Otake and Schull, 1998].
Whether these findings generalize to doses less than 10 mGy has not been
established [Hall and Giaccia, 2005, BEIR, 2006]. The existence of various
sources of very low-level ionizing radiation (e.g., radon) makes this a public
health question of general and continuing relevance.
The ideal study of the effects of low dose radiation would assign doses
randomly, an approach that is not feasible for ethical and practical reasons,
the latter because for low doses, effects are presumably correspondingly
small and thus require a large sample size to be detected [Brenner et al.,
2003].
The Chernobyl accident provides a nearly ideal natural experiment in
radiation exposure. Deposition occurred between April 27 and May 10 in
Sweden [Moberg, 1991], creating a pronounced spike in radiation levels.
For example, Figure 1 shows measured gamma radiation in Umeå, 400
miles north of Stockholm, which jumped more than ten-fold at the end of
April, 1986. Differences in rainfall immediately after the accident caused
substantial geographic variation in deposition [Holmberg et al., 1988]. The
northern parts of Sweden were virtually spared, while near the cities of
Gävle and Sundsvall, located on the Baltic sea about midway between
3

the northern and southern most points of the country, ground deposition of Caesium-137 averaged 44 kBq/m2 (Table 1, also see Figure 2).1
This feature of the research design enables us to compare within cohorts,
and assess whether regional variation in fallout predicts the magnitude of
damage to the cohort between weeks 8 and 25 post-conception at the time
of Chernobyl, holding constant other regionally-varying determinants of
students outcomes, observed and unobserved (e.g., differences in parents’
cognitive skills by county).
We evaluate student outcomes in a comprehensive data set on virtually
all Swedes born 1983-1988 – some 562,637 individuals – measuring performance in the final year of compulsory schooling. These data also record
the month and place of birth, which we use to link student outcomes to
average Chernobyl deposition by region, measured aerially by the Swedish
Geological Co. in the accident’s aftermath.
We find that the cohort of likely fetal age 8-25 weeks post conception
during the accident and born in one of the eight most affected municipalities was 4% less likely to qualify to high school (or equivalently, were 40%
more likely to fail middle school). Grade point averages were 5% lower.
Moreover, students born in regions with more modest levels of Chernobyl
fallout also registered damage (of correspondingly smaller magnitudes)
relative to the least-exposed far north of Sweden. These results are robust to family fixed effects, mitigating selection concerns. Those born

Maximum doses for the Swedish population were estimated at 3-4 mSv in the first

year Holmberg et al. [1988], Edvarson [1991a]. For gamma radiation, 1 Gy corresponds
to 1 Sv.

4

February-May 1986, and thus outside the period brain development has
been deemed particularly radiosensitive, showed no corresponding damage.
To our knowledge, ours is the first large scale study of the effects of fetal
exposure to very low-level ionizing radiation – levels hitherto considered
safe and/or having undetectable effects – on school performance.

1.1

Literature review

A series of studies by Otake and Schull (summarized in Otake and Schull
[1998]) analyzed the effect of in utero exposure to radiation after the
Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bomb explosions in August, 1945. The
sample used in these studies contains information on 1,566 individuals
(1,242 in Hiroshima and 324 in Nagasaki) who (prenatally) were closer
than 2,000 meters from the hypocenter of the atomic bombs. Two control
groups from the same areas were matched on to the sample on the basis of
age and sex: one from distally exposed survivors (3,000-4,000 meters from
the hypocenter) and one of non-exposed survivors (> 10,000 meters). In
addition to some anthropometric measures – such as weight, height and
head size – these studies also analyzed cognitive ability (IQ) and school
records.
The Otake and Schull studies contain several results of relevance for
our analysis. First, they established an effect on both IQ and school
records for children exposed between week 8 and 25 post-conception. For
children exposed earlier or later, no significant effect were found. Second,
5

the effect was estimated to be linearly increasing in the level of exposure.
Third, no conclusive evidence on a threshold level for radiation effects was
established.

1.1.1

Chernobyl and Cognitive Outcomes

A number of previous studies have found reduced cognitive functions due
to prenatal radiation in high fallout areas of Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia, e.g., Nyahu et al. [1998], Kolominsky et al. [1999], Loganovskaja and
Loganovsky [1999]. However, these studies have focussed on populations
born near the reactor. As a consequence, they suffer from weaknesses related to the comparability of the treatment and control populations. Along
with other potential confounders, the physical dislocation (forced evacuations) of the treated population limits the comparability of the treated
and control groups. Moreover, sample sizes have been relatively small.
Nyahu et al. [1998] compared 544 children in Ukraine who lived near
the Chernobyl reactor and were in utero at the time of the accident to
Ukrainian children born in “radioactively clean zones”. Despite having
similar heights and weights at birth as the control group, prenatally exposed children were more likely to be mentally retarded (IQ < 70) less
likely to have a high IQ (>110) and reported more emotional and behavioral problems. However, the fact that mothers of prenatally exposed
children also had lower IQ scores, as well as worse mental health, than the
control parents undermines the internal validity of the study’s conclusions.
As Kolominsky et al. [1999, p. 304] noted, “Living in contaminated areas,

6

as well as forced resettlement, lead to the growth of emotional tension of
parents.”
Other studies have found no or small effects. Litcher et al. [2000] found
no effect on school performance from Chernobyl fallout. They studied 300
Ukranian children evacuated from the 30-kilometer zone around Chernobyl, comparing them with “same-sex non-evacuee child[ren] selected
from the same classrooms as each evacuee. Thus, they had the same
teachers and daily schedule, and resided in similar apartment buildings,”
Litcher et al. [2000, p. 292]. The exposed children were not significantly
different along objective measures including school performance, intelligence, attention, or memory. However, the “treated sample” included
children up to age 15 months at the time of the meltdown.
Joseph et al. [2004] studied cognitive and behavioral outcomes of 1,629
children from the former Soviet Union who had subsequently migrated to
Israel. The immigrants came from areas that ranged in fallout exposure
from ‘uncontaminated’ to ‘highly contaminated.’ They did not find evidence of impaired cognitive ability. However, their sample included children up to age 4 years at the time of the accident, meaning that only 270
children were in utero during the accident and only 98 of these were from
areas with Caesium-137 ground deposition in excess of 37 kBq m−2 . Hyperactivity and attention deficit disorder were higher among all children
in utero at the time (irrespective of area of origin or stage of gestation).
Thus, weak or inconclusive results have prompted the conclusion that
Chernobyl damage, if any, reflects anxiety or stress brought on by the eco-

7

nomic and social upheaval following the evacuation of the Chernobyl vicinity and the fall of the Soviet Union [Joseph et al., 2004, UNDP/UNICEF,
2002, IAEA, 2006].

1.1.2

Chernobyl and Perinatal Outcomes

In contrast to the cognitive studies, perinatal impacts have been evaluated
in areas of Europe with substantially lower levels of Chernobyl fallout.
Outcomes including conceptions, spontaneous abortion, induced abortion,
stillbirth, gestation length, birth weight, and neonatal mortality have each
been studied. For each outcome, studies can be found on either side: some
find effects and others do not.
Some of the strongest evidence points to compromised outcomes at
birth resulting from Chernobyl. Scherb et al. [1999] studied stillbirths in
18 European countries and found elevated stillbirths following Chernobyl
in the more eastern countries of Europe: Poland, Hungary, Sweden, and
Greece. Lüning et al. [1989] found increased mortality among infants
within the first 7 days of life in West Germany in May of 1986, which the
authors attributed to Chernobyl fallout in southern Germany.
Increases in Down’s syndrome have been reported from a number of
countries, e.g., Belarus [Laziuk et al., 2002], Germany [Sperling et al.,
1994], and Sweden [Ericson and Källén, 1994], and has lately been acknowledged by the WHO [2006, p. 87] as Chernobyl related. (Irrradiation
of the fetus itself cannot cause Down’s syndrome.2 Thus, cognitive per2

Ericson and Källén [1994, p. 153] “If radioactive fallout causes Down syndrome, it

must be in pregnancies where conceptions occurred after the accident – or just before

8

formance of those irradiated weeks 8-25 post conception is not mediated
by Down’s syndrome.)
A number of studies have documented adverse perinatal and child
health outcomes in Scandinavia. Ericson and Källén [1994] studied the
universe of Swedish perinatal outcomes for 1985-1989 and found a slight
decrease in conceptions in June 1986, and a statistically significant increase
in Down’s syndrome among those born in 1987 in all areas with more than
5 kBq m−2 Caesium-137 ground deposition. They also recorded three cases
of childhood leukemia.3 In addition, Auvinen et al. [2001] found elevated
levels of spontaneous abortions in Finland following Chernobyl.

We use two measures of radiation exposure: aerial and in situ measurements, further described below.
the accident if mosaic cases are considered (which arise by a nondisjunction in an early
mitotic division after conception).”
3
In addition, no effects were found on the likelihood of short gestation or birth
weight below 2,500 grams. The likelihood of birth weight below 1,500 grams was
higher in July of 1986 than July 1985, which “could well be random” Ericson and
Källén [1994]:149. No change in either low birth weight measure (below 2,500 grams
or below 1,500 grams) was found for the birth cohorts for whom we find the largest
cognitive effects, see Section 3.

Aerial Measurement The Swedish Geological Co. (SGAB) (commissioned by the Swedish Radiation Protection Authority) conducted aerial
measurements of ground deposition gamma-radiation of Caesium-134 over
the period May-October 1986 and decay corrected to May 1986.
Caesium-134 was measured because of its stable relationship to Caesium137 (Cs-137/Cs-134=1.7) and its shorter half life (2 years), allowing for
the separation of radiation stemming from atmospheric nuclear weapons
tests and that from Chernobyl.
These aerial measurements are available for 2,380 parishes (out of
2,517). A parish is a rather small geographical entity, and for most people,
everyday activities would involve crossing parish boundaries. Therefore we
also aggregate up to both the municipality and county level.4 The detailed
geographic coverage is a strength of these data.
The aerial measurements, however, suffer from two drawbacks. First,
they lacked precision at low levels of ground radiation [Edvarson, 1991b].
Second, they only reflect deposition of Caesium isotopes. While its long
half life (30 years) makes Caesium-137 an obvious priority, our focus is on
the initial spike in radiation following the accident, for which Iodine-131
was an important contributor [Kjelle, 1991]. This motivates our interest
in the in situ measurements.
4

The county (län) is the first level administrative and political subdivision. There

are 21 counties. The second level is the municipality (kommun), and there are 290
municipalities.

10

In Situ Measurement The Swedish Defence Research Agency (FOA)
conducted in situ measurements at 63 locations. Figure 3 replicates Edvarson [1991b]:table 2, which displays aerial measurements corrected by
in situ measurements since “It was found that the SGAB measurements
in the low-deposition areas (< 2 kBq/m2 Cs-134) were higher than FOA
in situ measurements by a factor of 2-3...” Edvarson [1991b, p. 49].
Comparing Figures 3 and 4 it is clear that Iodine was an important
source of radiation in the initial aftermath of Chernobyl. Moreover, both
data sources show that the north of Sweden (Norrbotten county) had the
lowest levels of Caesium-137 ground deposition: 0.3 kBq m−2 .

2.1.1

Regional Groups

Based on the information from the aerial and the in situ measurements,
we classify Sweden into four groups as detailed in Table 1. Classification
at the measured extremes is straight-forward. The areas around Gävle
and Sundsvall were particularly hard hit, while Norrbotten county was
virtually spared. Consequently, we include in the top group Gävle and
Sundsvall and six contiguous municipalities. Together, these eight municipalities registered the highest levels of ground deposition of Caesium-137.
As for the control group, R0 (Norrbotten county) is motivated by Edvarson
[1991b, table 2], where Norrbotten shows the lowest values of Caesium-137
and Iodine-131 ground deposition.
Norrbotten is, however, a relatively sparsely-populated county. Therefore, we also present results from using a broader control group. Based

11

on Moberg [1991, figure 2], replicated in Figure 4, we extend the control
group to also include the counties denoted by R1 (Table 1): Stockholm,
Örebro and Värmland.
In sum, while data clearly single out our two extreme groups R0 and
R3, the division of the “middle” into R1 and R2 may be viewed as exploratory.

2.1.2

Radiation doses

While we believe the above measurements/regional grouping provide a
reasonable ordinal proxy for radiation exposure, there are several reasons
why the assignment is imperfect. First, we obviously do not know where
the expecting mother was at the time of Chernobyl, only where she was
registered at the time of giving birth. Second, we compare those in utero
at the time of Chernobyl to adjacent cohorts. Earlier cohorts were exposed as infants and later cohorts were exposed to radiation stemming
from long lived radionuclides (prenatally and postnatally). Thus, any effect we detect that is unique to the cohort in utero must be due to the
spike in radiation in the days after the accident. Iodine-131, whose release
was 20-100 times that of Caesium, was an important contributor to this
initial spike [Moberg, 1991], and only proxied by the Caesium-137 estimates. Third, ground depositions are more quickly washed away in urban
areas, therefore it is possible that urban areas received more fallout than
indicated by the values in the last two column of Table 1. Fourth, the actual dose a person received depends on a number of factors not captured

12

here. Since these radionuclides enter the food chain, internal irradiation
may depend on the local food distribution system and dietary habits (e.g.,
consumption of milk).
Despite these uncertainties, we are clearly evaluating effects of radiation well below what has been deemed a health hazard and/or having a
measurable impact. Radiation levels in Sweden, using the UN classification, ranged from negligible to ‘contaminated.’5 While small compared
to what the populations in Ukraine, Belarus and Russia suffered, a study
of very low-level exposure is of interest in its own right and for what
the results may imply for the risk assessment of other low-level radiation
sources, notably indoor radon radiation, and radiation in medical use.

2.2

Student Data

We focus on individuals born 1983-1988. That is, students born three
years before the accident through two years after.6
We have register data on all persons either born in Sweden 1983-1985
or the children of a Swedish-born parent born in the period 1940-1985. As
a result, we have almost universal coverage for cohorts born 1983-1985.
For the 1986 birth cohort, we capture everybody who had at least one
5

Maximum Cs-137 over a square measuring 200 by 200 meters was 156.49 kBq

m−2 (< 5 Ci km−2 ).
6
The reason the later window is shorter is that our graduation data ends with the
class of 2004. School entry is in the fall of the calendar year the person turns seven, and
compulsory schooling ends with grade nine, normally in spring of the year the person
turns 16.

13

Swedish born parent younger than 46 years (in 1986), and for 1987 and
1988 this age is 47 and 48 respectively. Since fertility is complete for nearly
all women by age 45, this means that coverage for the later cohorts is also
high.

2.2.1

Cohort groups

We focus on three cohorts as described below.
inutero Those born May 1986-February 1987 were arguably in utero at
the time of the accident. This grouping allows for effects in very
early pregnancy through late pregnancy. This broad categorization,
however, obscures possible gestational-age differences in sensitivity
to irradiation.
inutero8-25 As mentioned, the literature has identified weeks 8-25 post
conception as particularly sensitive to radiation. This motivates
singling out those born in the period August through December 1986
as being of a critical age around the time of the accident. The birth
interval was determined as follows: Assuming that the radioactive
cloud swept Sweden April 27-May 10; and a 38 week post-conception
gestation period, this implies that the “treated” group are those born
between July 27 and December 13, 1986. Since we only have data
on month of birth, we include those born August through December
1986 in our inutero8-25 cohort.
inutero0-7 A third group of interest are those born in January and
14

February 1987. Many of this cohort were 0 to 8 weeks post conception at the time of Chernobyl. We are interested in their school
performance since cognitive performance has not been found to be
affected by irradiation in this period by previous studies.7 We will
also investigate two other outcomes: cohort size and the sex ratio.
Cohort size depends on a number of factors, notably conceptions,
term pregnancies and perinatal outcomes. Pre-implantation is the
stage most sensitive to the lethal effects of radiation, while irradiation during organogenesis is more likely to result in neonatal death
[Hall and Giaccia, 2005, p. 169]. Also, the accident may have influenced fertility decisions both with respect to conceptions and induced abortions. Our interest in the sex ratio is motivated by the
observation that the male conceptus and fetus may be more susceptible to radiation, see Schull and Neel [1958], Peterka et al. [2004].

2.2.2

Outcome variables

Qualify HS To qualify to continue to high school, a passing grade is
needed in all the core subjects (English, Swedish, and Math). About
90% of students had passing grades in these subjects.
Grade points The sum of grades range from 0 to 320. These are the
total grades summed over all subjects in the final year of compulsory school. There are 16 subjects and four grade levels: fail - 0
7

Giaccia [2005, p. 169].

15

points, pass - 10 points, pass with distinction - 15 points, and pass
with special distinction - 20 points. The mean is approximately 200,
and there was a slight positive trend. Grades in core subjects are
“curved”, that is, reflect relative performance in nationally administered tests. The vast majority of the inutero8-25 cohort belong
to the class graduating in 2002, and this year sees no reduction in
average grades.8

3

Results

We find damage to cognitive performance as measured by grades in the
final year of compulsory education and qualification to continue to high
school for those exposed in utero. Consistent with the bio-medical literature, we find the effects to be concentrated among those most likely to
have been exposed weeks 8-25 post conception. Moreover, the effect is
substantially larger in areas with greater Chernobyl fallout.

3.1

Figures

We begin our empirical analysis by presenting the share qualifying to high
school by birth cohort in a series of figures. Because there is substantial
seasonality in school performance by birth month, we compare those born
August-December 1986 against those born in the same months but in
adjacent years.
8

The national averages were 202, 203 and 204 for the classes graduating in 2001,

2002 and 2003 respectively.

16

Figure 5 compares those in the worst affected area, R3 (“Gävle and
Sundsvall”, the “treatment group”) to the rest of Sweden. The two series
track each other fairly closely until 1986, when the share qualifying from
R3 drops substantially to produce a 3 percentage point gap.9 A similar
pattern is revealed in Figure 7, where the control group is those born in
areas R0 and R1 (Norrbotten, Stockholm, Örebro and Värmland counties). Restricting the control group further to the least affected area, R0
(Norrbotten), shows a qualitatively similar picture, Figure 9. The gap
is now larger, at about 5 percentage points, and it is noteworthy that
the difference is in part driven by the control group doing better for this
particular birth year. We believe this may be related to grades in the
core subjects (and thus qualification to high school) being assigned based
on nationally standardized test (and a decrease in “raw” scores for most
students).
Figures 6, 8, and 10 present the analogous series of figures but for those
born between February and May, i.e. cohorts for whom the biomedical
literature would not predict effects attributable to radiation. Clearly, the
poor performance of the 1986 cohort born in R3 does not extend to the
“spring” birth cohort, which reduces the likelihood that geographicallyvarying effects unrelated to Chernobyl account for the pattern observed
for the cohorts exposed between weeks 8 and 25 of gestation.
We now turn to the regression analysis.
9

The pre-treatment gap in qualification rates in Figure 5 is consistent with the

existence of effects on children born prior to Chernobyl and therefore exposed postnatally. We will estimate the additional effect attributable to prenatal exposure.

17

3.2

Regression Analysis

We estimate three basic regression specifications for those born 1983-1988.
First, we estimate the departure in school performance for all Swedes in
utero during Chernobyl:
yi = β0 × I(inutero*) + τyob + γmob + λcounty + δsex + ²i ,

(1)

where yi is the dependent variable of interest, I(inutero*) is an indicator variable that takes the value 1 for the cohort of interest (inutero,
inutero8-25) and 0 otherwise; β0 is the parameter of interest. We include
vectors of dummies for year of birth (τyob ), month of birth (γmob ), county
of birth (λcounty ), and gender (δsex ).
Second, we evaluate whether variation in Chernobyl fallout by area
within Sweden predicts the magnitude of the departure in outcomes for
the exposed cohort:
yi = β0 ×I(inutero∗)i +

3
X

βj ×rj ×I(inutero∗)i +τyob +γmob +λcounty +ρR3 +δsex +²i ,

j=1

(2)
where yi is the dependent variable of interest, rj denotes the three areas
exposed to varying degrees by Chernobyl: R1, R2, and R3 (see Table
1). The inclusion of county-of-birth indicators clearly subsumes inclusion
of the measured level of Caesium deposition for each county (geographic
grouping) along with any other time-invariant county or area-level characteristics. We also include a dummy variable for being born in one of the
eight high fallout municipalities, ρR3 . The parameter estimates of interest
are β̂j , j > 0 and we hypothesize that β̂3 ≤ β̂2 ≤ β̂1 < 0. These parame18

ters measure the extent to which the outcomes for the inutero* children
born in the corresponding areas at the time of the accident differ from the
inutero* children born in the reference (omitted) area, controlling for all
permanent differences between areas.
Our third empirical strategy is to apply the difference-in-differences
approach to a sample restricted to siblings (using the unique mother and
father identifiers) and compare those presumed exposed to Chernobyl radiation to their siblings.
We focus on the inutero8-25 cohort and estimate equation (2) where
we add a vector of indicator variables, one for each family (5,448 in total).
(We drop the indicator variable for gender, since we only look at samesex siblings. County effects are identified by families that report different
counties of birth for their children.) We restrict the sample to include only
those families with two same-sex full siblings whose fathers were married
as of 1990 (to reduce the likelihood that the parents had separated, an
event likely to have differential effects on siblings depending on age) where
one sibling belonged to the exposed cohort and the other one did not (but
was born between 1983 and 1988).
Including these fixed effects is equivalent to differencing the outcomes
and regressors of the sibling presumed exposed to Chernobyl fallout from
his/her presumed unexposed sibling. Therefore, comparisons of the Chernobyl effect are only made within (and not across) families. As before, if
school performance is affected by Chernobyl fallout, we would expect those
born between August-December 1986 to perform worse than their siblings,

19

and this difference to be larger for those born in areas that received more
fallout.
We estimate equations (1)-(2) for the following two outcomes: (1)
whether grades in core subjects (English, Swedish, Math) were sufficient
to qualify the individual to continue to high school; and (2) total grades
in the final grade of compulsory school.
We employ Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), where standard errors are
robust to heteroscedasticity and clustered at the region level.

3.2.1

Regression Results

Table 3 presents estimates of the average departure in outcomes for
the cohort in utero during the Chernobyl accident, controlling for year,
month, and county of birth, and gender (equation (1)). Columns (1) and
(3) estimate a “naive” model where we assume that prenatal irradiation
affects cognitive development equally irrespective of fetal age. In addition,
we consider all Swedes in utero during Chernobyl, regardless of place of
birth, to be equally exposed. Finally, we consider those not in utero to
be unexposed. With these assumptions, we find that the probability of
qualifying is reduced by 0.2 percentage points for the inutero cohort
(Column (1)). For grades, we find a 1 unit reduction (Column (3)).
In Columns (2) and (4), we make use of the finding that fetal irradiation 8 to 25 weeks post conception may be especially damaging to
cognitive development, and we find a larger reduction in performance for
this subgroup. For qualification, this group was 0.6 percentage points less

20

likely to qualify for high school – three times the “naive” estimate. For
grades, we find a similar, albeit less dramatic, increase in effect size.10

Table 4 assesses whether the apparent damage to the exposed cohorts
in Table 3 varies with geographic variation in fallout. Columns (1)-(3)
consider the naive model of exposure – that all those born between May
1986 and February 1987 would be equally affected by a given level of
fallout (inutero). By contrast, columns (4) to (6) only consider the five
last months of birth in 1986 (inutero8-25).
First, the R3 municipalities consistently show damage when compared
to other parts of Sweden. Column (1) compares the effect in R3 municipalities to the rest of Sweden (i.e., the excluded areas are R0, R1, and
R2). In Panel A, we see that the inutero cohort born in R3 municipalities
experienced a .018 drop in the probability of qualification (or roughly 10
times the effect for Sweden as a whole, Table 3). Column 2 now makes
comparisons relative to the two least-exposed areas: R0 and R1. We see
that the estimated damage to the inutero cohort born in the R3 municipalities increases slightly. In addition, the inutero cohort born in R2 is
estimated to have a slightly larger decrease in qualification rates but this
difference is not significantly different from zero. Column (3) repeats this
exercise by benchmarking against R0, the least affected area of Sweden.
We now find that the inutero cohort born in R3 suffered a .033 reduction
10

Virtually everybody born in 1986 was conceived prior to the Chernobyl accident,

and thus there was little scope for potential behavioral responses to Chernobyl with
respect to conception.

21

in the probability of qualifying. Moreover, the R2 inutero cohort shows
about half the estimated R3 effect, with a slightly smaller effect for the
R1 area. Nevertheless, all three exposed areas showed significant damage
compared to R0 (Norrbotten).
Panel B, columns (1) through (3), repeat the above exercise with grades
as the dependent variable. When comparing to the rest of Sweden, R3
natives of the inutero cohort are found to have lower grades: a drop of
2.2 grade units (column (1)). This estimate triples when we compare R3
to the R0 area (column (3)). Again, we find the estimated effect size to
correspond to the ordering of fallout.
Columns (4) through (6) restrict attention to the inutero8-25 cohort.
The qualitative pattern is the same as above, but the estimated magnitudes are generally larger. Note that in column (6), we find that the
average decrease in qualification rates in R3 municipalities was .036 or 4%
relative to R0. In Panel B, the analogous estimate is 10.6 grade units or
5%.
The magnitude of the results for grades can be interpreted as the average treatment effect for the three different fallout levels relative to the
inutero8-25 cohort born in the omitted area (Norrbotten). A change
in five grade points corresponds to the difference between pass and pass
with distinction in any of the 16 subjects counted in the final grade and
a change in 10 grade points corresponds to a one level change in two subjects, or the difference between pass (10 points) and fail (0 points). To
give a sense for the importance of such changes in grades, Table 2 shows

22

the percentiles between 40 and 60 in the distribution of grades for those
who graduated in 2003. A change in five grade points corresponds, for
example, to a change from percentile 46 to 50 or a change from percentile
53 to 56.11
In sum, we are finding substantial across-the-board effects for the cohort likely to have been of post-ovulatory age 8-25 weeks at the time of
Chernobyl, and the effect is more severe in more exposed areas.

Table 5 reports results when the aerially measured ground deposition
of Caesium-137 is entered as a linear term in equation (2). That is, we
P
replace the 3j=1 βj × rj × I(inutero8-25) term with β1 × Caesiumk ×
I(inutero8-25), where Caesiumk denotes the population-weighted arithmetic mean of Caesium-137 in area k, and k indexes the county, municipality, or parish, respectively.
Consistent with the Table 4 results, we find that higher local radiation
predicts larger deteriorations for the August-December birth cohort. Column (1) assigns the average Caesium-137 level in the county of birth to the
inutero8-25 cohort, finding that a 1 kBq m−2 increase in Caesium-137
ground deposition reduces the probability of qualification by .053 percentage points. Column (2) and Column (3) assign the municipalityand parish-level Caesium-137 measures to the exposed cohort, and find
11

As a comparison, in an evaluation of the STAR project, Krueger [1999] found a

gain of 4 percentile points for first year students in “small classes” (13-17 students)
compared to “regular classes” (22-25 students) on test scores and subsequently a 1
percentile point gain for each year in a small class.

23

a smaller (though still significant) effect on qualification. Changes to the
administrative division means that we lose 12% and 14% of the sample in
columns (2) and (3), respectively.
Columns (4) through (6) repeat the above specifications with grades
as the dependent variable. While the estimated β1 is negative for each
geographic unit k, only the parish-level Caesium-137 level is significantly
different from 0. Column (6) results imply a 0.058 unit reduction in grades
for each kBq m−2 unit increase in Caesium-137 deposition.
Table 6. Including fixed effects for each family, we find that those born
in the high-Caesium-137 deposition areas and exposed prenatally had
worse outcomes than their siblings. The inutero8-25 cohort in the R3
area had a 3 percentage point decrease in probability of qualifying relative to their (older or younger) sibling when the reference group was the
rest of Sweden, Column (1). When the R3 group was compared instead
to the least exposed R0 area, the estimated effect almost doubled to 5.6
percentage points. Again, the ordering of effect sizes corresponds to the
ordering of radiation fallout.
We repeat this exercise for grades and find an analogous pattern The
reduction in grades for the sibling inutero8-25 during Chernobyl was
16.3 points greater in R3 than the same difference in R0.
The existence of effects within families suggests that selection across
families into childbearing is not accounting for the effects found in previous
tables. In addition, note that the sibling comparison precludes comparison
with those born in the spring of 1986 (or spring of 1987), since one sibling
24

need to be born in the fall of 1986. If indeed the 1986 birth cohort benefited
from a relaxation of national standards in benchmarking students, we are
no longer able to compare to the spring cohort due to the existence of
a minimum in birth spacing, which could bias estimated damage toward
zero.

Table 7 presents results when dividing the sibling sample according to
father’s education. Panel A presents results from the sample where the father had two years of (vocational) high school or less; and Panel B presents
results for those whose fathers had three years of high school or more. The
education cut-off was chosen so as to create roughly similar sized samples.
From this division, it appears that the effect is more pronounced in the
group whose fathers had less education.

Table 8 shifts the focus to the cohort conceived in April and May 1986,
inutero0-7. The biomedical literature suggests that this cohort was too
young to suffer cognitive damage from the spike in radiation following
Chernobyl. Effects, if any, are believed to be terminal. Therefore, we analyze whether the cohort conceived around the time of Chernobyl is smaller
than predicted by seasonality and a linear cohort trend. As expected, we
find a fall in cohort size in these two months of 3.4% (276/8083). This can
be contrasted with Ericson and Källén [1994] who did not find reduced
conceptions or increased adverse pregnancy outcomes for April and May
1986.
Furthermore, consistent with Schull and Neel [1958], Peterka et al.
25

[2004], the inutero0-7 cohort is more female. This suggests that the
fall in fertility was partially the effect of spontaneous abortions (unless
Chernobyl induced abortions were performed disproportionately by those
who carried male fetuses – a not very likely scenario). Another possibility is that fertility was negatively selected these two months [Trivers
and Willard, 1973]. However, since the estimated effect is rather large, a
1.6 % (0.008/0.488) increase in the probability of a daughter, we believe
such selection cannot account for this pattern. (For instance, in the U.S.,
unmarried mothers were found to be 0.2 % more likely to bear daughters
[Almond and Edlund, 2007].)
While these patterns are consistent with the literature, several caveats
are in order. First, the geographic variation in Chernobyl fallout within
Sweden does not correspond to either the magnitude of the reduction in
cohort size or the tendency to be female. This stands in contrast to the
results presented in the preceding tables. Second, we would clearly prefer
to estimate effects on cohort size and gender using natality data, which
we plan to obtain, see Section 4. Finally, the academic outcomes among
those born in January and February are conflicting: a higher percentage
qualified to high school (Column 1), but grades were lower (Column 2).

Summary, Discussion and Future Work

We have studied the school performance in the final year of compulsory
school of the Swedish cohort born August through December 1986 – and
therefore of likely fetal age 8-25 weeks post conception at the time of the
26

Chernobyl accident. For this cohort, we estimate that those in the eight
municipalities that received the highest levels of fallout were 4% less likely
to qualify to high school and had 5% lower grades. Moreover, effects are
evident in intermediately affected areas – at correspondingly lower levels.
The fact that fallout varied distinctly in both time and space has allowed us to make difference-in-difference comparisons, which yielded supportive results. We also estimated effects using same-sex full siblings, one
of whom was born in the fall of 1986. This sibling comparison was then
compared across areas with differing levels of fallout. Had parental characteristics of those born in the fall of 1986 deteriorated relative to those
born in adjacent years, and this “negative selection” into child bearing
was more pronounced in counties that received more fallout, we might
erroneously attribute lower performance to radiation exposure (in the absence of family fixed effects). This situation could arise if better educated
or wealthier families temporarily moved from high fallout areas to low
fallout areas immediately following the accident. As we find a similar pattern with family fixed effects, we conclude that such parental differences
cannot explain out results.
Assuming that the highest dose to the Swedish population was 4 mSv
[Edvarson, 1991b], extrapolation of the results of Otake and Schull [1998]
of a reduction of 30 IQ points per Gy (assuming a 1:1 conversion to Sv),
implies a hardly detectable effect (4×30/1000=0.12 points maximum).
However, while our found effect sizes are greater than reasonably predicted by a no-threshold linear model, the Otake and Schull studies did

27

not conclude against the possibility of stronger results at very low doses,
and agnosticism regarding the effects of such low level ionizing radiation
characterizes the consensus view [ICRP, 2005, BEIR, 2006].
The magnitude of our findings are, however, consistent with Oftedal’s
study of school performance and fallout from weapons tests [Oftedal, 1989,
1991]. He found that among Norwegian children born in 1965, those most
likely irradiated at post-ovulatory age 8-15 weeks (from U.S. atmospheric
nuclear tests) performed worse in grades 7 and 9 in tests of Norwegian,
English and Mathematics. The effect size corresponded to about one year’s
development in 15-year olds. Whereas the dose was not known, Oftedal
conjectured that it could be no more than a couple of multiples of normal
background radiation, but likely much lower.
Other than the possibility of a stronger dose-response relationship at
very low doses [Oftedal, 1991], it can be noted that external radiation was
more important in the A-bomb cases, whereas internal irradiation (more
noxious, e.g. Busby and Fucic [2006]) is likely to have been more important
in the case of fallout from atmospheric nuclear tests and the Chernobyl
accident.
Several factors suggest that we may have underestimated the effect.
First, our estimated effects are for the initial spike in radiation. Radionuclides lingered in the environment and accumulated in bodies, suggesting
that later cohorts (used as controls) may also have been affected. We only
estimate the additional damage resulting from exposure weeks 8-25 postconception to radiation in the immediate Chernobyl aftermath. Second,

28

the areas R0 through R4 serve as ordinal proxies for individual doses. Using aggregates instead of individual doses does not necessarily introduce
a bias. However, if there is misclassification, e.g. a mother registered in
Gävle was in fact in Stockholm around the time of the accident, this could
introduce random misclassification that would bias results towards zero.
Third, note that the sibling comparison precludes comparison with those
born in the spring of 1986 (or spring of 1987), since one sibling was necessarily born in the fall of 1986. If indeed the 1986 birth cohort benefited
from a relaxation of national standards in benchmarking students, we are
no longer able to compare to the spring cohort due to the existence of
a minimum in birth spacing, which could bias estimated damage toward
zero.
Our findings contrast sharply with previous studies where weak or
inconclusive results have prompted the conclusion that damage, if any,
reflect anxiety or stress brought on by the economic and social upheaval
following the evacuation of the Chernobyl area and the fall of the Soviet
Union. According to the UNDP/UNICEF, in their report “The Human
Consequences of the Chernobyl Nuclear Accident,” only the top six municipalities in Sweden would be considered ‘contaminated’ albeit not at a
level associated with any objective health risk: “Radiation does not pose
serious health risks to any particular group. Economic activities may
be hindered by indirect association with Chernobyl.” UNDP/UNICEF
[2002]:table 3.4. The International Atomic Energy Agency was equally dismissive of the possibility of radiation related damage: “the mental health

29

impact of Chernobyl is the largest public health problem unleashed by the
accident to date.” IAEA [2006]:36.
In conclusion, we have documented that the Swedish cohort of gestational age 8-25 weeks post conception at the time of Chernobyl performed worse in the final year of compulsory schooling compared to adjacent cohorts and the effect was more pronounced in areas that received
more radioactive fallout. Future studies will investigate whether earlier
health manifestations (perinatal outcomes, in-patient records) presaged
our found effects; as well as track this cohort as it ages and additional
outcomes are realized.

The sample includes all singleton children belonging to the inutero8-25
cohort, i.e., those born in the period August-December 1986, who had one
same-sex full sibling born in 1983-1988, and these siblings. The sample is
further restricted to those whose father was married in 1990.
R3 has 316 observations, of which 160 belonged to the inutero0-25 cohort.
The control groups are as in Table 4. Their number of observations are
7441 [3724], 2828 [1410] and 311 [154] in regressions 1 (4), 2 (5), and 3 (6)
respectively [the figures in square brackets are the number of individuals
belonging to the inutero0-25 cohort].
All regressions include an indicator variable for area R3, as well as year,
month, and county indicator variables, and a constant.
Standard errors are clustered at the county level. Robust t-statistics in
brackets. * significant at 10%; ** significant at 5%; *** significant at 1%.
