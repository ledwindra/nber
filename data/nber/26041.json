    "abstract": "\n\nOrdeals are burdens placed on individuals that yield no direct benefits to others.  They represent a dead-weight loss.  Ordeals \u2013 the most common being waiting time \u2013 play a prominent role in health care.  Their goal is to direct scarce resources to recipients receiving greater value from them, hence presumed to be more willing to bear an ordeal\u2019s burden.  Ordeals are intended to prevent wasteful expenditures given that health care is heavily subsidized, yet avoid other forms of rationing, such as quotas or pricing.  This analysis diagnoses the economic underpinnings of ordeals.  Subsidies to nursing home versus home care illustrate.\n\n",
