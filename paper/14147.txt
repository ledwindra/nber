Comparing Price and Non-Price Approaches to Urban Water Conservation
Sheila M. Olmstead and Robert N. Stavins
NBER Working Paper No. 14147
June 2008
JEL No. L95,Q25,Q28
ABSTRACT
Urban water conservation is typically achieved through prescriptive regulations, including the rationing
of water for particular uses and requirements for the installation of particular technologies. A significant
shift has occurred in pollution control regulations toward market-based policies in recent decades. We
offer an analysis of the relative merits of market-based and prescriptive approaches to water conservation,
where prices have rarely been used to allocate scarce supplies. The analysis emphasizes the emerging
theoretical and empirical evidence that using prices to manage water demand is more cost-effective
than implementing non-price conservation programs, similar to results for pollution control in earlier
decades. Price-based approaches also have advantages in terms of monitoring and enforcement. In
terms of predictability and equity, neither policy instrument has an inherent advantage over the other.
As in any policy context, political considerations are important.

Comparing Price and Non-price Approaches
to Urban Water Conservation
Sheila M. Olmstead and Robert N. Stavins

1. Introduction

7

Cities, towns, and villages around the world struggle to manage water resources in the

8

face of population increases, consumer demand for water-intensive services, and increasing costs

9

(including environmental costs) of developing new supplies. In this paper, we provide an

10

economic perspective on reducing urban water demand through pricing and non-price

11

conservation policies. We compare price and non-price approaches to water conservation along

12

five dimensions: the ability of policies to achieve water conservation goals, cost-effectiveness,

13

distributional equity, monitoring and enforcement, and political feasibility.

14

The worst drought on record continues to unfold in the American southeast, affecting

15

major cities such as Atlanta, Georgia, and Raleigh, North Carolina. In the arid Western U.S., the

16

Colorado River system faces the worst drought on record, lasting (thus far) from 1999 to 2008

17

and leaving Lake Mead (the source of more than 90% of Las Vegas’s water) about half empty.

18

Municipal water consumption comprises only about 12% of total freshwater withdrawals

19

in the United States; and agricultural irrigation, the single largest water use, comprises just over

20

one-third of all withdrawals (Hutson et al. 2004). While analysis suggests that re-allocating

21

water from agriculture to cities would be efficient in many regions, in the current legal and

22

political setting, large-scale transfers of water rights from agriculture to cities are relatively

23

uncommon (Brewer et al. 2007, Brown 2006, Howe 1997). Thus, cities often must reduce water

24

consumption during acute shortages due to drought, or in the long run due to constraints on their

25

ability to increase supply.

1

26

The efficient water price is the long-run marginal cost (LRMC) of its supply. LRMC

27

reflects the full economic cost of water supply – the cost of transmission, treatment and

28

distribution; some portion of the capital cost of reservoirs and treatment systems, both those in

29

existence and those future facilities necessitated by current patterns of use; and the opportunity

30

cost in both use and non-use value of water for other potential purposes. Many analysts have

31

noted that water prices, for many urban as well as agricultural uses, lie well below LRMC (Sibly

32

2006, Timmins 2003, Hanemann 1997), with significant welfare consequences (Renzetti 1992,

33

Russell and Shin 1996). In the short run, without price increases acting as a signal, water

34

consumption proceeds during periods of scarcity at a faster-than efficient pace.

35

conservation takes place only under “moral suasion or direct regulation” (Howe 1997). In

36

contrast, if water prices rose as reservoir levels fell during periods of limited rainfall, consumers

37

would respond by using less water, reducing or eliminating uses according to households’

38

particular preferences.

39

location decisions, and other important factors. The sum of all these individual decisions affects

40

the sustainability of local and regional water resources.

Water

In the long run, inefficient prices alter land-use patterns, industrial

41

Implementation of efficient water prices would be challenging, to say the least. Some of

42

the opportunity costs of urban water supply are exceedingly difficult to quantify. What is the

43

value of a gallon of water left instream to support endangered species habitat, for example?

44

While economists have developed a variety of useful methods for estimating such values, the

45

expectation that every water supplier will develop full individual measures of the LRMC of

46

water supply is unrealistic. If LRMC represents an ultimate water pricing goal, there are smaller,

47

less ambitious steps toward efficiency that can be accomplished more readily.

2

48

Even with inefficient prices, injecting better price signals into the processes of water use

49

and allocation can result in important improvements. For example, given a particular public

50

goal, such as the conservation of a particular quantity of water or percentage of current

51

consumption, various policies can be employed, some more costly than others. Choosing the

52

least costly method of achieving some water-provision goal is characterized in economic terms

53

as cost-effective water management. Even if the water conservation goal is, itself, inefficient,

54

society can benefit from the minimization of costs to achieve it.

55

We focus on this issue of policy instrument choice for water conservation, summarizing

56

research from the economics literature, including both our own work on this issue and that of

57

other economists. Given the strong theoretical cost advantages of market-based approaches to

58

water conservation over conventional alternatives, and the emerging empirical evidence for the

59

potential cost savings from moving to market-based approaches to conservation, the time is ripe

60

for a discussion of the relative strengths and weaknesses of these policy instruments.

61
62

2. Cost-effectiveness of water conservation policies

63

Decades of theoretical and empirical economic analysis suggest that market-based

64

environmental policies are more cost-effective than conventional policies, often characterized as

65

command-and-control (CAC) or prescriptive approaches. Market-based regulations encourage

66

behavior through market signals rather than through explicit directives regarding conservation

67

levels or methods. These policy instruments, if well-designed and implemented, encourage firms

68

and households to undertake conservation efforts that are in their own interests and collectively

69

meet policy goals. CAC approaches, in contrast, allow little flexibility in the means of achieving

3

70

goals and often require households and/or firms to undertake similar shares of a conservation

71

burden regardless of cost.

72

In the area of pollution control, the cost-effectiveness advantage of market-based

73

approaches over CAC policies has been demonstrated theoretically (Pigou 1920, Crocker 1966,

74

Dales 1968, Montgomery 1972, Baumol and Oates 1988) and empirically (Keohane 2007,

75

Teitenberg 2006). Perhaps the best-known application of these principles to environmental

76

regulation is the U.S. SO2 trading program, established under Title IV of the Clean Air Act

77

Amendments of 1990, which has produced cost savings on the order of $1 billion annually

78

(Stavins 2003). Dozens of other market-based policies have been applied to air and water

79

pollution control, fisheries management, and other environmental problems in industrialized and

80

developing countries (Kolstad and Freeman 2007, Stavins 2003, Sterner 2003, Panayotou 1998).

81

Economists’ attention has only recently turned to examining the potential economic gains

82

from adopting market-based approaches to water conservation, rather than CAC approaches.

83

Whereas the gains from market-based approaches to pollution control depend critically on

84

heterogeneity in marginal abatement costs across firms (Newell and Stavins 2003), the cost

85

savings from market-based approaches to water conservation derive largely from heterogeneity

86

in households’ marginal benefits from water consumption (Mansur and Olmstead 2007). This is

87

because current CAC approaches to water conservation are essentially rationing policies. This

88

makes the application similar to other cases in which rationing has been replaced with price-

89

based allocation, such as traffic congestion on roadways (Parry and Bento 2002) and at airports

90

(Pels and Verhof 2004).

91

implementing non-price policies, can substantially reduce the economic cost of achieving water

92

consumption reductions (Collinge 1994; Krause et al. 2003; Brennan et al. 2007).

Recent studies demonstrate how raising prices, rather than

4

93

In order to illustrate the basic economics, we can examine one typical CAC approach to

94

water conservation – a citywide required demand reduction achieved by uniformly restricting

95

outdoor uses. Figure 1 portrays two households with the same indoor demand curves, but

96

different preferences with respect to outdoor demand. The difference in slopes of the three

97

demand curves is associated with differences in elasticity – the percentage change in demand

98

prompted by a one percent price increase. (For all but one specific class of demand function,

99

price elasticity varies along the demand curve, thus while we can speak broadly about

100

comparisons across demand curves, there may be points on a relatively steep demand curve at

101

which price elasticity exceeds that on some parts of a flat demand curve.) Here we assume that

102

indoor demand (frame C in Figure 1), the steepest curve, is inelastic, because indoor uses are less

103

easily reduced in response to price changes, reflecting the basic needs met by indoor water use.

104

For outdoor demand, there is a relatively elastic household (Panel A), and a somewhat less

105

elastic household (Panel B). The more elastic household is more likely to reduce outdoor demand

106

in response to a price increase – perhaps because it has weaker preferences for outdoor

107

consumption (e.g., in the short run, it would rather allow the lawn to turn brown than pay a

108

higher water bill to keep it green).

109

Unregulated, with price set at P , both households consume QC units of water indoors, the

110

less elastic household consumes QBunreg outdoors, and the more elastic household consumes QAunreg

111

outdoors.

112

unchanged, and reduces outdoor uses to QBreg and QAreg ) creates a “shadow price” for outdoor

113

consumption (λ) that is higher under the current marginal price ( P ) for household B than for

114

household A, because household B is willing to pay more for an additional unit of water than

115

household A. If instead the water supplier charges price P*, that achieves the same aggregate

Outdoor reduction mandated under a CAC approach (which leaves indoor use

5

116

level of water conservation as the prescriptive approach, consumers would realize all potential

117

gains from substitution within and across households, erasing the shaded deadweight loss (DWL)

118

triangles. Consumption moves to QC* indoors for both types of households, and to QA* and QB*

119

outdoors. The savings from the market-based approach are driven by two factors: (1) the ability

120

of households facing higher prices rather than quantity restrictions to decide which uses to

121

reduce according to their own preferences; and (2) allowing heterogeneous responses to the

122

regulation across households, resulting in substitution of scarce water from those households

123

who value it less, to those who value it more.

124

How large are the losses from non-price demand management approaches when

125

examined empirically?

We know of only three cases in which the welfare losses from

126

prescriptive water conservation policies have been estimated. Timmins (2003) compared a

127

mandatory low-flow appliance regulation with a modest water price increase, using aggregate

128

consumption data from 13 groundwater-dependent California cities. Under all but the least

129

realistic of assumptions, he found prices to be more cost-effective than technology standards in

130

reducing groundwater aquifer lift-height in the long run.

131

Another study of 11 urban areas in the United States and Canada compared residential

132

outdoor watering restrictions with drought pricing (Mansur and Olmstead 2007). For the same

133

level of aggregate demand reduction as implied by a two-day-per-week outdoor watering

134

restriction, the establishment of a market-clearing drought price in these cities would result in

135

welfare gains of approximately $81 per household per summer drought. This represents about

136

one-quarter of the average household’s total annual water bill in the study.

137

Using a different approach, Brennan et al. (2007) constructed a household production

138

model to estimate the welfare cost of urban outdoor water restrictions in Perth, Australia, and

6

139

arrived at similar conclusions. The household welfare costs of a two-day-per-week sprinkling

140

restriction are just under $100 per household per season, and the costs of a complete outdoor

141

watering ban range from $347-$870 per household per season.

142

Based on both economic theory and empirical estimates, the inescapable conclusion is

143

that using price increases to reduce demand, allowing households, industrial facilities, and other

144

consumers to adjust their end-uses of water is more cost-effective than implementing non-price

145

demand management programs.

3.1

Predictability in Achieving Water Conservation Goals
Effects of Price on Water Demand

149

If policymakers are to use prices to manage demand, the key variable of interest is the

150

price elasticity of water demand. Because an increase in the price of water leads consumers to

151

demand less of it, all else equal, price elasticity is a negative number. (Elasticity figures may

152

also be reported in absolute value, and the negative sign is then implicit. We use the more

153

conventional negative sign in this paper.) An important benchmark in elasticity is –1.0; this

154

figure divides demand curves into the categories of elastic and inelastic.

155

There is a critical distinction between “inelastic demand” and demand which is

156

“unresponsive to price”.

If demand is truly unresponsive to price, price elasticity is equal to

157

zero, and the demand curve is a vertical line – the same quantity of water will be demanded at

158

any price. This may be true in theory for a subsistence quantity of drinking water, but it has not

159

been observed for water demand more broadly in fifty years of empirical economic analysis.

160

That said, water demand in the residential sector is sensitive to price, but demand is

161

inelastic at current prices. In a meta-analysis of 124 estimates generated between 1963 and

7

162

1993, accounting for the precision of estimates, Espey et al. (1997) obtained an average price

163

elasticity of –0.51, a short-run median estimate of –0.38, and a long-run median estimate of –

164

0.64. Likewise, Dalhuisen et al. (2003) obtained a mean price elasticity of -0.41 in a meta-

165

analysis of almost 300 price elasticity studies, 1963-1998. And a recent, comprehensive study of

166

water demand in eleven urban areas in the United States and Canada found that the price

167

elasticity of water demand was approximately –0.33 (Olmstead et al. 2007). The price elasticity

168

of residential demand varies substantially across place and time, but on average, in the United

169

States, a 10% increase in the marginal price of water in the urban residential sector can be

170

expected to diminish demand by about three to four percent in the short run. This is similar to

171

empirical estimates of the price elasticity of residential energy demand (Bohi and Zimmerman

172

1984, Bernstein and Griffin 2005).

173

There are some important caveats worth mentioning. First, elasticities vary along a

174

demand curve, and any estimate represents an elasticity at a specific price, in particular, actual

175

(current) prices. Were prices to approach the efficient levels discussed earlier, water demand

176

would likely be much more sensitive to price increases.

177

Second, consumers are relatively more sensitive to water prices in the long run than they

178

are in the short run, because over longer time periods, capital investments are not fixed. For

179

example, households might change appliance stocks, retrofit water-using fixtures, or alter

180

landscaping from lawns to drought-tolerant plants; firms can be expected to change water-

181

consuming technologies, increase recycling, or relocate to areas in which water is more plentiful.

182

In the long run, a 10% price increase can be expected to decrease demand by about six percent.

183

Third, price elasticities vary with many other factors. In the residential sector, high-

184

income households tend to be much less sensitive to water price increases than low-income

8

185

households. Also, price elasticity may increase by 30 percent or more when price information is

186

posted on water bills (Gaudin 2006). And price elasticity may be higher under increasing-block

187

prices (in which the marginal volumetric water price increases with consumption) than under

188

uniform volumetric prices (Olmstead et al. 2007). Price elasticities must be interpreted in the

189

context in which they have been derived.

190

3.2

Effects of Non-price Conservation Programs on Water Demand

191

Historically, water suppliers have relied on non-price conservation programs to induce

192

demand reductions during shortages. We consider the effects of such non-price programs in

193

three categories: (1) required or voluntary adoption of water-conserving technologies; (2)

194

mandatory water use restrictions; and (3) mixed non-price conservation programs.

195

3.2.1 Required or Voluntary Adoption of Water-Conserving Technologies

196

Many urban water utilities have experimented with required or voluntary adoption of

197

low-flow technologies. (Since the 1992 Energy Policy Act, U.S. law has required the installation

198

of low-flow toilets and showerheads in all new residential construction, but some cities have also

199

mandated or encouraged retrofitting.) When water savings from these programs have been

200

estimated, they have often been smaller than expected, due to behavioral changes that partially

201

offset the benefit of greater technical efficiency.

202

showerheads may take longer showers than they would without these fixtures (Mayer et al.

203

1998). The necessity of the “double flush” was a notorious difficulty with early models of low-

204

flow toilets. In a recent demonstration of similar compensating behavior, randomly-selected

205

households had their top-loading clotheswashers replaced with more water efficient, front-

206

loading washers. In this field trial, the average front-loading household increased clothes-

9

For example, households with low-flow

207

washing by 5.6 percent, perhaps due to the cost savings associated with the appliances’ increased

208

efficiency (Davis 2006).

209

Several engineering studies have observed a small number of households in a single

210

region to estimate the water savings associated with low-flow fixtures. But most of these studies

211

used intrusive data collection mechanisms, attaching equipment to faucets and other fixtures in

212

homes (Brown and Caldwell 1984). Study participants were aware they were being monitored as

213

they used water, which may have led to confounding behavioral changes.

214

One comprehensive study that was not characterized by this monitoring problem

215

indicates that households fully constructed or retrofitted with low-flow toilets used about 20

216

percent less water than households with no low-flow toilets. The equivalent savings reported for

217

low-flow showerheads was 9 percent (Mayer et al. 1998).

218

showerhead retrofit programs in the East Bay Municipal Utility District, California, and Tampa,

219

Florida estimate water savings of 1.7 and 3.6 gallons per capita per day (gpcpd), respectively

220

(Aher et al. 1991; Anderson et al. 1993).

221

statistically significant effect in Boulder, Colorado (Aquacraft 1996). Savings reported for low-

222

flow toilet installation and rebate programs range from 6.1 gpcpd in Tampa, Florida to 10.6

223

gpcpd in Seattle, Washington (U.S. General Accounting Office 2000). Renwick and Green

224

(2000) estimate no significant effect of ultra low-flush toilet rebates in Santa Barbara, California.

225

It is not surprising that studies of the water savings induced by such policies vary widely,

226

from zero to significant water savings – the scope and nature of policies vary widely, as well.

227

More important than the raw water savings induced by these programs, however, is the cost per

228

gallon saved, in comparison with alternative policies.

229

implemented in U.S. cities range from less than $100,000 to replace 1,226 toilets in Phoenix,

Careful studies of low-flow

In contrast, showerhead replacement had no

10

The costs of toilet retrofit policies

230

Arizona to $290 million for 1.3 million toilets in New York City (U.S. General Accounting

231

Office 2000). These can be expensive programs, but in most cases no analysis is done to

232

estimate the magnitude of price increases that would have induced demand reductions equivalent

233

to those observed with technology standards. Only with such information can price and non-

234

price demand management programs be compared as policy options on the basis of cost.

235

3.2.2 Mandatory Water-Use Restrictions

236

Non-price management tools also include utility implementation of mandatory water use

237

restrictions, much like the traditional command-and-control approach to pollution regulation.

238

These include restrictions on the total quantity of water that can be used, as well as restrictions

239

on particular water uses, usually outdoors, such as lawn-watering and car-washing. Empirical

240

evidence regarding the effects of these programs is mixed. Summer 1996 water consumption

241

restrictions in Corpus Christi, Texas, including prohibitions on landscape irrigation and car-

242

washing, did not prompt statistically significant water savings in the residential sector (Schultz et

243

al. 1997). However, a longer-term program in Pasadena, California resulted in aggregate water

244

savings (Kiefer et al. 1993), as did a program of mandatory water use restrictions in Santa

245

Barbara, California (Renwick and Green 2000).

246

3.2.3 Mixed Non-Price Conservation Programs

247

Water utilities often implement a variety of non-price conservation programs

248

simultaneously, making it difficult to determine the effects of individual policies. One analysis

249

of the effect of conservation programs on aggregate water district consumption in California

250

found small but significant reductions in total water use attributable to landscape education

251

programs and watering restrictions, but no effect due to non-landscape conservation education

252

programs, low-flow fixture distribution, or the presentation of drought and conservation

11

253

information on customer bills (Corral 1997). Another study of southern California cities found

254

that the number of conservation programs in place in a city had a small negative impact on total

255

residential water demand (Michelsen et al. 1998). An aggregate demand study in California

256

found that public information campaigns, retrofit subsidies, water rationing, and water use

257

restrictions had negative and statistically significant impacts on average monthly residential

258

water use, and the more stringent policies had stronger effects than voluntary policies and

259

education programs (Renwick and Green 2000).

260

3.2.4. Summing up the predictability comparison

261

Predictability of the effects of a water conservation policy may be of considerable

262

importance to water suppliers, although in most cases the objective of water conservation

263

policies is water savings, without any specific target in mind. In this case, an estimate of the

264

reduction expected from policy implementation is necessary, but precision is less important.

265

If certainty is required, economic theory would suggest that the quantity restrictions

266

typical of traditional, prescriptive approaches to water demand management would be preferred

267

to price increases, particularly if water suppliers could be sure of near-total compliance, or at

268

least be able to adjust their water savings target upward to account for a reliable estimate of the

269

noncompliance rate (Weitzman 1973).

270

compliance with quantity-based restrictions. In a comprehensive study of drought management

271

policies among 85 urban water utilities during a prolonged drought in Southern California,

272

analysts reported that 40 agencies adopted mandatory quantity restrictions, but also found that

273

more than half of the customers violated the restrictions (Dixon et al. 1996). Such non-binding

274

quantity constraints are common, but how are utilities to predict the water savings achievable

275

through quantity restrictions when less than half of consumers typically comply? In the same

But suppliers generally cannot rely on substantial

12

276

study, about three-quarters of participating urban water agencies implemented type-of-use

277

restrictions (most of them mandatory). Few penalties were reported, and enforcement was weak,

278

again raising questions regarding compliance.

279

traditional quantity-based regulations, neither price nor non-price demand management programs

280

have an advantage in terms of predicting water demand reductions.

With such low rates of compliance with

Equity and Distributional Considerations

283

The main distributional concern with a market-based approach to urban water

284

management arises from the central feature of a market – allocation of a scarce good by

285

willingness to pay (WTP). Under some conditions, WTP may be considered an unjust allocation

286

criterion. Think, for example, about the negative reaction to selling food and water to the highest

287

bidder in the aftermath of a natural disaster. This sense that there are some goods and services

288

that should not be distributed by markets in particular contexts is behind the practice of rationing

289

during wartime. A portion of water in residential consumption is used for basic needs, such as

290

drinking and bathing. “Lifeline” rates and other accommodations ensuring that water bills are

291

not unduly burdensome for low-income households are common.

292

considering market-based approaches to water management must be concerned about equity in

293

policy design.

Thus, policymakers

294

What does the empirical evidence tell us about the equity implications of water pricing as

295

a conservation tool? Agthe and Billings (1987) found that low-income households exhibited a

296

larger demand response to price increases in Tucson, Arizona, but the study did not compare the

297

distributional effects of price and non-price approaches. Renwick and Archibald (1998) found

298

that low-income households in two Southern California communities were more price-responsive

13

299

than high-income households, reflecting water expenditures’ larger share of the household

300

budget. Thus, if water demand management occurs solely through price increases, low-income

301

households will contribute a greater fraction of the cities’ aggregate water savings than high-

302

income households. This is not surprising to economists – price elasticity tends to decline with

303

the fraction of household income spent on a particular good.

304

Importantly, the distributional implications of non-price policies vary by type.

For

305

example, requiring particular landscape irrigation technologies results in demand reduction

306

mainly among higher-income households (Renwick and Archibald 1998).

307

Mansur and Olmstead (2007) examined the distributional impacts of various demand

308

management policies, and found that raising prices to reduce consumption would cause a greater

309

consumption reduction for low-income than for high-income households. (If we return to Figure

310

1 and assume that households of type A are low-income and type B are high-income, we can see

311

why this happens.)

312

The fact that price-based approaches are regressive in water consumption does not mean

313

they are necessarily regressive in cost. Likewise, the fact that non-price programs are progressive

314

in water consumption does not mean they are progressive in cost. The impact of non-price

315

programs on distributional equity depends largely on how a non-price program is financed. And

316

progressive price-based approaches to water demand management can be designed by returning

317

utility profits (from higher prices) in the form of rebates. In the case of residential water users,

318

this could occur through the utility billing process.

319

Drought pricing, like LRMC pricing, would cause utilities to earn substantial short-run

320

profits (Mansur and Olmstead 2007). These profits would have to be returned to consumers in

321

some form, as regulated utilities usually are required to earn zero or very low profits. Profits

14

322

could be re-allocated based upon income, in order to achieve equity goals. Any rebate scheme

323

that is not tied to current consumption can retain the strong economic-incentive benefits of

324

drought pricing, without imposing excessive burdens on low-income households, relative to

325

traditional approaches.

326
327

Monitoring and Enforcement

328

Price-based approaches to water demand management hold a substantial advantage over

329

non-price approaches in regard to administrative costs for monitoring and enforcement. Non-

330

price demand management policies require that water suppliers monitor and enforce restrictions

331

on particular fixtures, appliances, and other technologies that customers use indoors and out, the

332

particular days of the week or times of day that customers use water for specific purposes, and in

333

some cases, the quantity used for each purpose.

334

The great difficulty in monitoring and enforcing these types of command-and-control

335

approaches is one reason for the prevalence of outdoor watering restrictions – outdoor uses are

336

usually visible, and it is relatively easy to cruise residential streets searching for violators.

337

Overall, monitoring and enforcement problems explain the low rates of compliance with many

338

non-price demand management programs. Where low-flow fixtures are encouraged or required,

339

they are often replaced with their higher-flow alternatives if consumers are dissatisfied with

340

performance.

341

In contrast, non-compliance in the case of pricing requires that households consume

342

water “off meter,” since water consumption is metered and billed volumetrically in most U.S.

343

cities. Of course, higher prices generate incentives not only for conservation, but also for

344

avoidance.

However, at prevailing prices and even with substantial price increases, the

15

345

monitoring and enforcement requirements of price changes are likely to be far less significant

346

than those of a comparable non-price approach.

347
348

6.

Political Considerations

349

Water demand management through non-price techniques is the overwhelmingly

350

dominant paradigm in cities around the world. Raising prices, particularly for what people

351

perceive to be a “public service” (though water is supplied by both public and private entities),

352

can be politically difficult. After a two-year drought in the late 1970s, the city of Tucson,

353

Arizona was the first U.S. city to adopt marginal-cost water prices, which involved a substantial

354

price increase. One year later, the entire Tucson city council was voted out of office due to the

355

water rate increase (Hall 2000). Just as few elected officials relish the prospect of raising taxes,

356

few want to increase water rates.

357

Ironically, non-price programs are more expensive to society than water price increases,

358

once the real costs of programs and associated welfare losses are considered. A parallel can be

359

drawn in this case to market-based approaches to environmental pollution control, including

360

taxes and tradable permit systems. Cost-effectiveness has only recently been accepted as an

361

important criterion for the selection of policies to control pollution (Keohane et al. 1998).

362

Despite empirical evidence regarding their higher costs, political constituencies that prefer non-

363

price approaches have succeeded in preventing management through prices.

364

resistance to using prices may be due to misinformation, since most policymakers and water

365

customers are not aware of the cost-effectiveness advantage of the price-based approach. For

366

example, a common misconception in this regard is that price elasticity is “too low to make a

367

difference”.

16

Some of this

368

Non-price demand management techniques can create political liabilities in the form of

369

water utility budget deficits. Non-price conservation programs are costly. In addition, if these

370

policies actually reduce demand, water utility revenues decline. During prolonged droughts,

371

these combined effects can result in the necessity for substantial price increases following

372

“successful” non-price conservation programs, simply to prevent water utilities from

373

unsustainable financial losses. This occurred in 1991 in southern California. During a prolonged

374

drought, Los Angeles water consumers responded to the Department of Water and Power’s

375

request for voluntary water use reductions. Total use and total revenues fell by more than 20

376

percent. As a result, the Department requested a rate increase to cover its growing losses (Hall

377

2000). In contrast, given urban price elasticities common in the United States, price increases

378

will increase water suppliers’ total revenues. The extra per-unit revenues from a price increase

379

outweighs lost revenue from the decreased demand.

380

The costs of inefficient water pricing and the relative cost advantages of price over non-

381

price water demand management programs are clear. But like other subsidies, low water prices

382

(on a day-to-day basis, as well as during periods of drought) are popular and politically difficult

383

to change.

384

385

rate-setting officials may be constrained by law, unable to increase water prices by a percentage

386

that exceeds some statutory maximum.

Conclusions

390

Using prices to manage water demand is more cost-effective than implementing non-

391

price conservation programs. The gains from using prices as an incentive for conservation come

392

from allowing households to respond to increased water prices in the manner of their choice,

393

rather than by installing a particular technology or reducing particular uses, as prescribed by non-

394

price approaches. Price-based approaches also have important advantages in terms of monitoring

395

and enforcement.

396

In terms of predictability, neither policy instrument has an inherent advantage over the

397

other. Likewise, neither policy instrument has a natural advantage in terms of equity. Under

398

price-based approaches, low-income households are likely to contribute a greater share of a

399

city’s aggregate water consumption reduction than they do under certain types of non-price

400

demand management policies.

401

management can be developed by returning some utility profits due to higher prices in the form

402

of consumer rebates. Such rebates will not significantly dampen the effects of price increases on

403

water demand, as long as rebates are not tied to current water consumption.

But progressive price-based approaches to water demand

404

Raising water prices (like the elimination of any subsidy) is politically difficult, but there

405

may be political capital to be earned by elected officials who can demonstrate the cost-

406

effectiveness advantages of the price-based approach. At a minimum, communities choosing

407

politically popular low water prices over cost-effectiveness should quantify this tradeoff and

408

make it explicit. Where water rate-setting officials are constrained by law from raising water

409

prices, during droughts or in general, a discussion of the real costs of these constraints would be

410

useful.

18

411

We are reminded of the debate, beginning in the late 1980s, over market-based

412

approaches to pollution control. While some opponents of environmental taxes and tradable

413

permit systems still resist these approaches, policymakers have succeeded in implementing them

414

in many cases, achieving impressive pollution reductions at great cost savings over more

415

prescriptive approaches. A similar shift in the area of water conservation, where the principles

416

are essentially the same, is long overdue.
