    "abstract": "\n\nThis study examines the role of implicit and explicit stereotypes behind gender-discriminatory behavior. The empirical context is the grading discriminatory behavior of math teachers in experimental settings. Previous observational studies demonstrated that math teachers show gender bias when grading papers. The mechanisms behind this behavior are mostly unexplored. We asked teachers to grade gender-manipulated exam papers and measured their grading behavior and implicit and explicit gender stereotypes. We found that implicit gender stereotypes and underestimating own implicit stereotypes were associated with boy-favoring grading behavior. Reducing implicit gender stereotypes and exposing teachers to their implicit biases may promote gender equality in schools.\n\n",
