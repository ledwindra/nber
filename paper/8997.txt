ABSTRACT
This paper contains a review of the burgeoning research that has been designed to shed light on
how the art auction system actually works and what it indicates about price formation. First, we find that
in recent years returns on art assets appear to be little different from returns on other assets. In addition,
some researchers have found that because of the weak correlation between art asset returns with other
returns, there may be a case for the inclusion of art assets in a diversified portfolio. Second, we find
evidence of several anomalies in art market pricing. The evidence clearly suggests that, contrary to the
view of the art trade, "masterpieces" underperform the market. In addition, there is considerable evidence
that there are fairly long periods in which art prices may diverge across geographic areas and even auction
houses. Third, we review the public record of the criminal trial of Sotheby's former Chairman, who was
accused of price fixing, to show how the collusion with Christie's, the other great public auction house,
was actually engineered. Contrary to the way the proceeds from the settlement of the civil suit in this case
were distributed, we show that buyers were almost certainly not injured by the collusion, but that sellers
were. In addition, based on the public record of settlement, it appears that the plaintiffs in the civil suit
were very handsomely repaid for their injury. Finally, we review the extensive research on the effects of
the auction institution on price formation. There is now considerable theoretical research on strategic
behavior in auctions, much of it in response to empirical findings, and we review three key findings.
First, the evidence suggests that art experts provide extremely accurate predictions of market prices, but
that these predictions do not optimally process the publicly available information. Second, high reserve
prices, and the resulting high unsold ("buy-in") rates are best explained as optimal search in the face of
stochastic demand. Third, extensive research has documented that the prices of identical objects are more
likely to decline than to increase when multiple units are sold, and this has led to considerable theoretical
research. Subsequent empirical research has tended to document declining demand prices even when the
objects are imperfect substitutes.

The value of most important works of art is established by public auction, either
directly, by an actual sale, or indirectly, by reference to other sales. How the auction
system works is thus a critical determinant of how the public’s preferences are
translated into the evaluation of artistic work. The auction system is thus central in
the determination of the incentives for artistic work, and the efficiency of the auction
system is a key determinant of the cost of creating and distributing works of art.
This paper contains a review of the burgeoning new research of the last decade
that has been designed to shed light on how the art auction system actually works,
what it indicates about price formation, and how well it performs. We begin the paper
with a description of the mechanics of the auction system. We organize the remainder
of our discussion around four major topics. First, we review what the data have
shown about movements of art asset prices over time. Art objects are generally
unique, so that measuring time-series movements in their prices requires careful
measurement and extensive data. A primary goal of the measurement of time-series
movements in art prices is to evaluate the benefits of including art assets in a balanced
investment portfolio, and we review the key findings on this topic next. We find that
in recent years returns on art assets appear to be little different from returns on other
assets. In addition, some researchers have recently found that because of the weak
correlation between art asset returns with other returns, there may be a case for the
inclusion of art assets in a diversified portfolio. Since the key parameters for making
this decision are difficult to estimate, this issue deserves far more research.
A second primary topic is the study of potential anomalies in art market pricing.
The evidence clearly suggests that, contrary to the view of the art trade,
“masterpieces” underperform the market, although the precise interpretation of this
finding is still open for study. In addition, there is considerable evidence that there

3

are fairly long periods in which art prices may diverge across geographic areas and
even auction houses.
A third area of research, where public interest has been particularly great in the
past few years, is the role of the competitive behavior of the auction houses in the
determination of prices. We review the public record of the criminal trial of
Sotheby’s former Chairman, who was accused of price fixing, to show how the
collusion with Christie’s, the other great public auction house, was actually
engineered. Contrary to the way the proceeds from the settlement of the civil suit in
this case were distributed, we show that buyers were almost certainly not injured by
the collusion, but that sellers were. In addition, based on the public record of
settlement, it appears that the plaintiffs in the civil suit were very handsomely repaid
for their injury by the auction houses.
Finally, we review the extensive research on the effects of the auction institution
on price formation. There is now considerable theoretical research on strategic
behavior in auctions, much of it in response to empirical findings, and we review
three key findings. First, the evidence suggests that art experts provide extremely
accurate predictions of market prices, but that these predictions do not optimally
process the publicly available information. Second, high reserve prices, and the
resulting high unsold (“buy-in”) rates are best explained as optimal search in the face
of stochastic demand. Third, extensive research has documented that the prices of
identical objects are more likely to decline than to increase when multiple units are
sold, and this has led to considerable theoretical research. Subsequent empirical
research has tended to document declining demand prices even when the objects are
imperfect substitutes, although the empirical analysis required in this case must be
much more sophisticated.

1. The Mechanics of Art Auctions
Historically, the major auctioneers of art have been the English houses of
Sotheby’s and Christie’s. These houses, along with other smaller houses such as
Phillips in England and regional auction houses elsewhere, such as Butterfields in
California, have invented and refined the rules of what have now come to be called
“English” or “ascending price” auctions. Almost all art is auctioned in this ascending
price format. Bidding starts low, and the auctioneer subsequently calls out higher
and higher prices.1 When the bidding stops, the item is said to be “knocked down” or
“hammered down”, and the final price is the “hammer price.”
Not all items that have been put up for sale and “knocked down” have been
sold. Sellers of individual items will set a secret reserve price, and if the bidding does
not reach this level, the items will go unsold. Auctioneers say that an unsold item has
been “bought-in.” As we show below, sale rates vary tremendously across time and
across different types of auctions
An item that has not been sold is rarely, if ever, actually bought by the auction
house. It may be put up for sale at a later auction, sold elsewhere, or taken off the
market. It is a part of the auctioneer’s art to “get the bidding started,” and this may
involve accepting fictitious bids (“off the chandelier” or “from the order book”) so
long as the bidding has not exceeded the reserve price. Legally, the auctioneer is
bidding on behalf of the seller when this occurs, but must refrain from accepting
further bids on behalf of the seller once the bidding exceeds the reserve price.
Auction houses differ with respect to whether they announce during the sale
whether an item has been “sold” or is merely “knocked down” and is unsold. In New
York, all the auction houses have been compelled by law since the early 1980s to

5

announce whether the bidding has resulted in a sale. The practice elsewhere varies by
location and auction house, but there has clearly been a slow movement toward
adopting the practice originally enacted by law in New York. While difficult, it is
sometimes possible during an auction, if one listens carefully, to determine whether
an item has been sold or “bought in.”
Prior to an auction, it is common for a pre-sale catalogue to be published with
information on the individual items coming up for sale. Included in the pre-sale
catalogue is information on the title of a painting, the artist, the size of the painting,
and the medium. The auction houses also publish a low- and a high-price estimate for
the work. The auction house does not publish, and indeed is very secretive about, the
seller's reserve price for the work of art. The auction houses do commonly observe an
unwritten rule of setting the secret reserve price at or below the low estimate, but the
auctioneer is very careful about revealing anything about the reserve price during the
bidding process.
Auction houses earn income primarily from commissions charged to buyers
and sellers. The commission charged to buyers is called the “buyer’s premium.” The
total sale price to the buyer is thus the sum of the “hammer price” and the buyer’s
premium. In recent years published buyer’s premiums have typically hovered around
10% to 17.5% of the hammer price of an object, but they are often lower for large
purchasers. Although buyers may attempt to negotiate special arrangements
regarding buyer’s premiums, it is our impression that the typical buyer purchases such
a small fraction of the objects on sale at a particular auction house that special terms
for buyers are unusual.

1

What is called an English auction is, in fact, Roman. The word auction comes from the Latin
“auctio,” which means to ascend.

6

Sellers also pay a commission to the auction house called the ”seller’s
commission.” Although the seller’s commission is often stated as a percentage of the
hammer price (typically 10%), it is our impression that actual seller’s commissions
are often negotiated arrangements that differ by seller. In some cases, sellers pay no
commission and may even be guaranteed a minimum sale price. Some key issues
related to the negotiation of seller’s commissions, and the extent of competition and
collusion in the setting of commission rates have recently surfaced in the trial of
Alfred Taubman, former Chairman of Sotheby’s, who was convicted of price fixing.
We discuss issues related to competition among auction houses in more detail below.
2. Art Price Indices
A key feature of art auctions is that the items on sale are typically
unique, or nearly so. The result is that there will be some ambiguity in the
construction of a single index of the movement of prices over time. One concern
about simply using average prices is that price rises may be exacerbated during booms
as “better” paintings may come up for sale. For example, Wynne Kramarsky, whose
family formerly owned Van Gogh’s “Portrait of Dr. Gachet,” said of the London
market prior to the poor sale of May 15, 1990: “’I did not think that London was poor
in terms of performance; I thought that the pictures were not up to it.’” (Watson,
1992, p.10) In general average prices will indicate variability over time in art prices
that is better described as movements in the heterogeneity of the quality of the objects
offered rather than movements in prices.
The extent of heterogeneity, and thus the ambiguity in the construction of
auction price indices, differs across the items typically offered for sale by auction.
Identical prints may be offered for sale monthly, while identical Impressionist

7

paintings, such as the “Portrait of Dr. Gachet” may not be offered at all in a single
decade.
Most art auction indices are based on a model where the price of the ith object
sold in time period t is
pit=pi+pt+εit,
where pi is the fixed component of the price that reflects the unique and fixed
character (or “quality”) of the object, pt reflects the index of aggregate movements in
prices, and the remainder is an idiosyncratic error term. The key distinction in the
construction of price indices is whether the fixed component is treated as determined
by a small number of hedonic characteristics, x, that may be controlled by regression,
or whether it is treated as a parameter that must be controlled explicitly.
“Hedonic models” control for the fixed effect pi with the assumption that
pi=βxi + εi, where εi is an error term independent of the pt’s, and estimate
pit=βxi+pt+ εi + εit
Alternatively, “repeat sale” models include a dummy variable for each painting.
The great attraction of hedonic models is that all the data may be used in the
estimation, including data on objects that are only offered for sale once in the sample
period. The disadvantage of these models is the strong assumption that a (typically
small) set of x variables captures much of the variability in the fixed components of
price (important if the estimates of the time effects are to be precise) and that the
characteristics of the objects offered do not vary systematically over time (important
for unbiased estimates of the time effects). Although the repeat sale method
overcomes the primary disadvantages of the hedonic model, it does so at the cost of
discarding much data. There must be at least two observations on a painting’s price
or it provides no information to help identify the time index. Indeed, depending on the

8

frequency at which repeat sales occur, it may not be possible to identify all the time
effects in the model. For example, in our own data on Impressionist and Modern
paintings, our hedonic model incorporates as many as 8792 observations, while the
repeat sale estimates are based on only 474 observations.
Comparisons of the results from repeat sale and hedonic models have been
reported by Chanel, Gerard-Varet, and Ginsburgh (1996). The overall results
indicate that both hedonic and repeat sales regressions yield estimates of real rates of
return in art assets over long intervals that are the same magnitude. In some cases the
hedonic model may also provide adequate estimates of time-series movements in
aggregate prices. The danger remains that systematic movements in the unobserved
characteristics of the objects being offered for sale may bias the results.
The nature of possible systematic movements is made clear when we do a
detailed comparison using our data on Impressionist and Modern Art. When yearly
price indices are constructed, the two types of indices at first appearance are very
similar. Figure 1 presents a graph of the hedonic and repeat sales price indices for
Impressionist and Modern art from 1980 to 1991. The correlation between the two
estimates is .9559, the standard deviation of the hedonic price index is 1.024, and the
standard deviation of the repeat sales index is 1.166. However, because of
movements in the very last year, the two indices give very different internal rates of
return. The hedonic index gives a real return of about 4%, while the repeat sales price
index results in a real return of about 9%! Which is correct? For 1991, our data ends
in May. The “major” impressionist sales are generally held in October. One
explanation is that the hedonic index has underestimated the returns for this short
period of time, because it was unable to correct for quality differences that occur
during sales in the early part of the year. An alternative explanation is that because

9

the repeat-sales index is based on such a small number of paintings during that period,
these paintings were unrepresentative (i.e. their price held up better in poor market
conditions) of the market as a whole.

Figure 1: Repeat-Sales and Hedonic Indices for Impressionist Art
One can also measure the extent to which one type of index deviates from the
other. Suppose, for example, that the repeat sales index, x, is the true index, and x* is
a measured hedonic index, where
x*=x+v*
If x were not measured with error then a regression of x* on x would give a slope of
unity. If not, the difference from unity provides an estimate of the measurement error
as a fraction of the total variance in the hedonic index. (A more complex model
would have x measured with error, but uncorrelated with v*, say as a result of
sampling error.) Computing the above regression, we find that x has a coefficient of
.8400, and a standard error of .086, thus indicating statistically significant
measurement error. The implication is that about 16% of the variance in the hedonic
measure of prices is measurement error.

A survey

*As many of the surveys only report nominal returns, the authors calculated
the real return rates as follows. For the Anderson and Baumol studies, an inflation
rate of .7 percent a year was used. This number is based on Baumol's estimate of
inflation during the 300 year period of his study using the Phelps-Brown and Hopkins
price index. Goetzmann's estimate of inflation during the period of his study (also
based on Phelps-Brown and Hopkins) is 1.2%. French price inflation between 1962
and 1992 according to OECD statistics was 7%.

The estimated returns to holding art are quite dependent upon the time frame
actually studied, which is not unexpected.2 Even among authors looking at similar
time frames, the returns can vary. The variation reflects differences in data, along
with differences in method. It is difficult to come to any broad conclusions about the
differences in estimates when using repeat-sales or hedonic indices. Anderson (1974)
finds a real return of 2.6% using hedonic indices and 3.0% using repeat sales on art
data from 1780-1960, and Chanel et. al. (1996) find real returns of 4.9% and 5.0% for
hedonic and repeat sales indices, respectively, for the period 1855-1969.
3. Art as an Investment
A primary concern of many of these papers is whether art outperforms or
underperforms stocks and bonds and the correlation of art investment returns with
other investment portfolios. Once a rate of return on art assets is calculated based on
one of the price indices above, it is possible to use this return to decide whether it may
be sensible to include art investments in a diversified portfolio. Generally, art
investments are more attractive as investments (using the standard capital asset
pricing model) the greater is their return relative to the return on a risk free asset and
the weaker the correlation (or beta) between art investment returns and the return on
other assets. Pesando (1993) has used the standard market model to assess these two
characteristics of art investments in the case of modern prints. Pesando estimates the
model:
RtP-rf,t=α+β(Rm,t-rf,t)+ut
where RtP denotes the return on the print portfolio, Rm,t denotes the return on the
market portfolio (Pesando uses the S&P 500 stock index), and rf,t denotes the risk free
rate (Pesando uses 180-day Treasury Bills). Pesando estimates a β for the entire print
2

For example, Goetzmann (1996) (not included in Table 1) estimates real returns from 1907-1977 on

13

portfolio of .315 and estimates negative, but insignificant, risk adjusted returns. This
implies that print investments tend to reduce the riskiness of a portfolio comprised of
stocks only.
Determining whether art outperforms or underperforms a market portfolio is
not an easy question to address. First of all, as Goetzmann (1993) points out, there
are many problems with the calculation of the returns to art, beginning with selection
bias in the data. As all of the sales prices are drawn from auction records, only
paintings that have been re-auctioned are included. This excludes both the high end
and the low end of the return distribution. Paintings that fall drastically in value or
are not generally in demand are generally not resold at auction; in addition, paintings
that are donated to museums do not reappear. Furthermore, whether or not an owner
decides to sell a painting at auction may be determined by whether or not the painting
has increased in value. Other problems with estimating returns are that transaction
costs are excluded and in contrast to stocks and bonds, as we noted above, these can
be quite high (as much as 25% of the value of the object considering both buyer’s
premiums and seller’s premiums). Finally, there is significant theft and fire risk (and
hence insurance costs) and cleaning costs involved in investing in art.
On the other hand, unlike stocks and bonds, art also pays some dividends in
the form of the pleasure the viewer (and owner) receives. In principle, the value of
these dividends could be measured by the rental cost of similar art assets, but we are
unaware of any study that has attempted to do this. Moreover, it seems unlikely that
these returns would be significant for a large, diversified art portfolio that is not
displayed.

auction data to be 13.3%, and even after correcting for survivorship problems, the returns remain at
5%.

14

Baumol (1986) and Goetzmann (1993) tend to concur that art is dominated as
an investment vehicle. Goetzmann writes “While returns to art investment have
exceeded inflation for long periods, and returns in the second half of the 20th century
have rivalled the stock market, they are no higher than would be justified by the
extraordinary risks they represent.” Goetzmann (1993) does not formally estimate a
CAPM, but simply reports correlations of art returns with inflation, the Bank of
England Rate, consol bond returns, and the London Stock Exchange.
Although their estimates of the return to art are not significantly different from
previous estimates, Mei and Moses (2001) take a different view. They argue that “a
diversified portfolio of artworks may play a somewhat more important role in
portfolio diversification than discovered in earlier research.” They base their
conclusions on their finding that their art price index has lower volatility and a much
lower correlation with other asset classes than reported in previous research. They
report that these differences are partly due to sample selection and partly due to a
different time frame studied. Although Mei and Moses (2001) estimate a more
sophisticated form of CAPM than has previously been estimated for art, they
primarily base their conclusions on their estimates of the art index and simple
correlations with bond and stock portfolios.3
Thus, it appears that different views about the financial benefits of investments
in art assets are primarily based on empirical issues that revolve, in part, around the
temporal instability and sensitivity of the estimates of key parameters related to the

3

For the CAPM, Mei and Moses follow Campbell (1987) and estimate

r i,t+1=Et[ri,t+1] + ∑k=1K βik f k,t+1 + εi,t+1,
where r i,t+1 is the excess return on asset I held from time t to time t+1. Et[ri,t+1] is the conditional
expected return on asset, conditional on information known to market participants at the end of time
period t. It is allowed to vary over time (see Mei and Moses (2001) for details). f k,t+1 are excess
returns on k different asset classes.

15

market performance of art investments. This suggests that an important area for
additional research is the development of a more general empirical model that will
provide an explanation for temporal instability and thus lead to better-informed
decisions.
Some authors have looked at the financial returns to holding other collectible
items. For example, Ross and Zondervan (1989) estimate the real returns to holding
Stradivari Violins between 1803 and 1987 to be 2.2%, and Graeser (1993) estimates
returns to holding antique furniture between 1967 and 1986 to be 7%. For a very
good survey of papers calculating the rate of returns in various markets, see Frey and
Eichenberger (1995).
4. The Masterpiece Effect
Pesando (1993) describes the “Masterpiece Effect” by quoting art dealer
Edward Merrin: “`…it’s always better to buy one $10,000 object than ten $1,000
objects, or one $100,000 object --- if that is what you can afford---than ten $10,000
ones.’”4 There have now been several authors who have tested for the masterpiece
effect.
Pesando tests for the effect by constructing a portfolio of the top 10 or 20% of
prints by price, where price is determined during the first few years of his sample. If
the “art trade” view is correct, the estimated price indices for these “Masterpieces”
should uniformly outperform the general portfolio. He finds no support for this view
and in fact finds that in part of his sample, masterpieces provide the lowest
cumulative return. Mei and Moses (2001) find a similar negative effect for
masterpieces, and in fact find this effect to be uniform across American, Impressionist
and Old Master samples.

16

Using our data on Impressionist and Contemporary Art, we find that it does
appear that “Masterpieces” have underperformed in the Contemporary Art sample,
but not in the Impressionist Art sample. We construct our index by dividing each
sample into the top 20% of paintings sold by price, and the bottom 80% sold by price,
and then construct a hedonic index. Our index is charted in Figures 1 and 2. We find
similar results to Pesando and Mei and Moses in Contemporary Art, but find no
effects in Impressionist Art. For Contemporary Art, “Masterpieces” underperform the
lower-valued paintings by about 5% on average per year, which is quite significant.
There does not appear to be a difference for the Impressionist Art dataset. The latter
result may not be inconsistent with the findings of others as the Impressionist Art data
consists of paintings that have already been pre-selected to represent the Impressionist
artists that show up most at auction. These are among the best known painters of all
time and it may be that virtually all of their paintings are considered masterpieces.

Figure 3: Impressionist Art
Pesando provides no explanation for the “Masterpiece Effect.” Mei and Moses
(2001) speculate that it may be due to overbidding and then mean reversion. This
explanation appears quite reasonable given the way that various studies above have
defined “Masterpieces” as the highest price paintings that were sold. If a
“Masterpiece” is defined purely by price, there may be some paintings in the
18

“Masterpiece” sample that randomly commanded a higher price, perhaps because two
or more bidders had high private valuations for the paintings. At a later auction, the
prices on these paintings revert to the mean, thus resulting in a negative
“Masterpiece” effect.
A different explanation for the negative “Masterpiece Effect” may be what
Goetzmann (1996) terms “survivorship bias.” It is likely that the more expensive
paintings remained in the sample throughout, even if they decreased in value, whereas
less expensive paintings have dropped out of the sample. Hence it may appear that
“Masterpieces” have underperformed in the sampled data, but in actuality less
expensive paintings that have underperformed are no longer in the sample. The result
that our sample shows a “Masterpiece” effect for Contemporary Art but no
“Masterpiece” effect for Impressionist art tends to support the “survivorship bias”
explanation, due to the way the two samples were constructed. A summary of papers
estimating a “Masterpiece Effect” is presented in Table 2 below.

5. Is There Evidence that Paintings are “Burned?”
As Ashenfelter (1989) noted, it is often claimed that when an advertised item
goes unsold at auction, its future value will be affected. Such items are said to have
been “burned.” There has been surprisingly little work testing this proposition.

19

Using our repeat sales data on impressionist art, we present summary statistics
of artworks that appear twice in the data. We have looked at whether there appear to
be any differences in prices and estimates for paintings that came to auction and did
not sell during their first appearance at auction, but sold during their second
appearance at auction (unsold-sold sample), vs. those that came to auction, sold
during their first appearance, and were resold again during their second appearance at
auction. We do this by comparing the ratio of the estimate a painting during its
second appearance at auction to the estimate of the same painting during its first
appearance at auction (estimate 2/estimate 1) and by comparing the ratio of the sale
price during the painting’s second appearance at auction to the estimate of the
painting during its first appearance at auction (sale price 2/estimate 1).

We average

these over the unsold-sold sample and the sold-sold sample. We do not correct for the
level of the art price index when the paintings came to market; hence, any results are
only suggestive.
As reported in Table 3, we find a significant difference between the unsoldsold sample and the sold-sold sample. We find that the sale price in the second sale is
on average 1.75 the estimate in the first sale, if the painting was unsold in the first
sale, and the sale price in the second sale is on average 3.77 the estimate in the first
sale, if the painting was sold in the first sale. Furthermore, it takes much longer for
paintings to reappear in the sample if they have been sold the first time around than if
they went unsold the first time around. These results do not necessarily indicate that
paintings that are bought-in are “burned,” and may simply indicate that paintings that
reappear in the sample tend to reappear because they have increased in value.
Nonetheless, the results are

20

suggestive.

6. Competition (or Collusion) Between Auction Houses
Prior to 1995, Sotheby’s and Christie’s were in fierce competition for
consignments from sellers. At times, they would drastically cut commission rates
paid by sellers, in many cases to nothing, make donations to sellers’ favourite
charities, and even extend financial guarantees to the sellers. In March of 1995, this
competition abruptly ended. Christie’s announced that it would charge sellers a fixed
nonnegotiable sliding-scale commission on the sales price, and a month later
Sotheby’s announced the same policies. Detailed documents kept by Christopher
Davidge, Christie’s former chief executive, show that the abrupt change was due to a
price-fixing conspiracy. By admission, the conspiracy involved at least Christopher
Davidge and Diana Brooks, Sotheby’s chief executive, and it was alleged to have
involved Sir Anthony Tennant and A. Alfred Taubman, the chairmen of Christie’s and
Sotheby’s, respectively. In fact, after a lengthy criminal trial, Taubman, a U.S.
citizen, was convicted of price fixing, which is a felony in the U.S. Although

21

Tennant, a UK citizen, was also indicted in the U.S., price fixing is a civil offence in
the United Kingdom and thus he was not extradited or tried. Christopher Davidge
(and in some cases Sir Anthony Tennant) had kept detailed records describing the
conspiracy. A civil suit, which has been settled, also alleged that Christie’s and
Sotheby’s conspired since 1993 to fix buyer’s commissions. Because it ended in a
public trial, this lawsuit provides an extraordinary window for viewing the operation
of successful price conspirators.
The case progressed as follows (see especially Stewart (2001) for a detailed
description). The Justice Department agreed in January of 2000 not to prosecute
Christie’s in return for its cooperation in the case. Diana Brooks, former president
and chief executive of Sotheby’s, pleaded guilty to one felony count of price-fixing on
October 5, 2000, and promised to cooperate fully in the government’s investigation.
In September of 2001, Sotheby’s agreed to plead guilty to conspiring with Christie’s
to fix sellers’ commissions, and agreed to pay a fine of forty-five million dollars over
five years. Sotheby’s maintains their innocence with respect to fixing buyer’s
premiums. Also in September of 2001, a civil suit was settled where Sotheby’s and
Christie’s agreed to each pay two hundred and fifty-six million dollars to the
plaintiffs. This class-action suit comprises anyone who had bought or sold items
through the auction houses since 1993.
From an economist’s point of view, the settlement of the civil suit is
interesting, but appears to be misguided. Although Sotheby’s did not admit to fixing
buyer’s premiums in the criminal settlement of the case, both Christie’s and Sotheby’s
agreed to each pay $256M to both buyers and sellers. This amount was calculated
taking the price-fixing of buyer’s premiums into account. According to In Re Auction
Houses Antitrust Litigation (2001), “The proposed plan of allocation estimated the

22

overcharges to sellers as 1 percent of the hammer price, and those for buyers to be 5
percent of the hammer price up to and including hammer prices of $50,000, and
$2,500 for buyers at hammer prices exceeding $50,000. The net settlement fund
would be distributed to class members pro rata based upon each class member's
overcharges during the relevant period.”
Even if Sotheby’s and Christie’s admitted to colluding on buyer’s premiums,
the usual theory of private value auctions implies that, to first order, buyers deserve
no compensation! The following is the reason why. When a buyer decides to bid in
an ascending price auction, his strategy should be to bid up to his reservation price, if
necessary. The price that the winning bidder has to pay is essentially (epsilon above)
the reservation price of the second highest bidder. When buyer’s commissions are
raised, each buyer should reduce his reservation price by an equivalent amount,
resulting in a reduction in revenue to the seller by the amount of the buyer’s
commission. Hence, the entire increase in buyers’ commissions should fall on the
seller. Thus, the standard model of private value auctions implies that the entire
settlement arrangement in the civil suit was misguided!
The criminal trial of Alfred Taubman, previously Chairman of Sotheby’s
Board, in the fall of 2001 provided some dramatic revelations about the details
surrounding the price fixing. Many of these details were provided in the testimony of
Diana Brooks, previously President of Sotheby’s. First, although remarkably candid
about her role in the fixing of seller’s commissions, Ms. Brooks did not provide any
evidence of collusion with respect to buyer’s premiums. Second, Ms. Brooks
estimated that the collusion on seller’s commissions resulted in higher profits to
Sotheby’s of some $10 to $15 million per year. Assuming that Christie’s received the
same increased profits implies that total damages suffered by sellers would be on the

23

order of $20 to $30 million per year. Assuming the conspiracy lasted 5 years
(approximately the time period involved) suggests total damages of $100 to $150
million. Since price fixing damages are, by statute, tripled, it appears that the
plaintiffs were more than amply compensated for the harm they incurred.
Finally, the details of the arrangement for price fixing revealed by Ms. Brooks
suggest that great care was ensured to keep virtually all other employees of the
auction houses from learning of the conspiracy. Taubman met solely with Tennant,
and Brooks solely with Davidge in arranging the details of the conspiracy. Indeed,
Brooks reported that at one point Taubman proposed that the auction houses collude
in providing clients with similar estimates of the value of their art. Brooks reported
that this was impossible because she could not simply tell Christie’s departmental
experts, who produce the estimates, to do a dishonest job.
7. The Law of One Price
The effect of the changes in sellers’ commissions and buyers’ premiums that
occurred during the 1990’s may provide an interesting subject for study by
economists. Ashenfelter (1989) studied changes in buyers’ premiums on the final
price of wine at auction. In the spring of 1986, buyer’s premiums were 10% at
Sotheby’s London (and at other locations), but Christie’s in London had no buyer’s
premium. In the spring of 1986, prices at Sotheby’s in London were 12% less than
prices at Christie’s in London, likely reflecting the difference in buyers’ commissions.
In the fall of 1986, Christie’s had instituted a 10% buyer’s premium in the London
auctions. In auctions held in the fall of 1986, there was no difference in prices, while
in an auction held in the spring of 1987, prices at Sotheby’s in London were 5%
higher than at Christie’s, and in the fall of 1987, prices at Sotheby’s in London were

24

4% lower than at Christie’s. These results indicate that the incidence of the buyer’s
premium does tend to fall on the sellers.
Other authors have looked at price differences between auction houses and
between different markets. Pesando (1993) focused on the sale of identical prints in
different markets which occur within 30 days of each other for the period 1977-1992.
For the entire period, he found that prices were 7% higher in New York than in
London, and 10% higher in New York than in Europe. However, the difference was
not statistically significant for the period 1977-1989, while it was statistically
significant at 11% and 17% in comparisons of New York and London and New York
and Europe, respectively, between 1989 and 1992. Pesando (1993) describes the
trade explanation as being the presence of Japanese buyers in the New York market
during that period, though one would expect any systematic price differences to
disappear when buyers respond to incentives. Pesando also finds significant
differences among auction houses. For the entire period, Pesando found that prices
average 14 percent higher in Sotheby’s in New York than at Christie’s in New York,
but there was no difference in the prices of prints at Sotheby’s and Christie’s in
London.
Using a price index for all art, Mei and Moses (2001) find mixed evidence on
the law of one price. When they do find price differences, these differences tend to be
small. A summary of papers testing for the law of one price is presented in Table 4
below.

8. Sales Rates and Reserve Prices
As we noted above, items that are put up for sale at auction often go unsold
because the bidding in the auction does not meet the reserve price. Sale rates vary
tremendously over time and they also vary systematically across different types of
auctions. Table 5 shows sale rates in different departments at Christie’s in London in
1995 and 1996 along with average value of a lot sold. As can be seen from the table,
96% of items put up for sale in auctions of arms and armour were sold, 89% of wine
at auction was sold, and 71% of impressionist and modern art items were sold.

Ashenfelter, Graddy and Stevens (2002) provide a study of sale rates across
time in art auctions and across different types of auctions. Based on the observation
that an item is bought-in if and only if it does not meet or exceed its reserve price,
they develop a model of optimal reserve prices. The seller of a painting faces the
following problem: if he participates in an auction the highest bid for the painting can

be regarded as a random draw from some price distribution. When a seller sets a
reserve price, he must decide at what price he would be indifferent between selling
now and waiting for the next auction. The optimal policy is to set a reserve price that
is a constant proportion of the current expected price. Sale rates can then be modelled
as being explained by price shocks and a constant, or “natural sale rate.” This natural
sale rate (which may vary across different types of auctions) depends only on the
variance of log prices and the seller’s discount rate. They estimate that the reserve
price is generally set to be about 70 to 80% of the auctioneer’s low estimate.
Although reserve prices are generally secret, the available evidence suggests that this
prediction is reasonably accurate.
Genesove (1995) tests a related, but somewhat different theory in the context
of wholesale automobile auctions. He finds that on average sale rates in used auto
auctions are actually quite low; between about 58% and 68% of automobiles go
unsold. In his paper, he tests a result by Balvers (1990) that also states that an
increase in variance decreases the probability of sale. He finds that an increase in the
log-variance is associated with a lower probability of sale, and hence the “natural sale
rate” is again dependent on variance of log prices.
Other authors have studied strategic reasons for setting reserve prices. For
example, in the classic article by Riley and Samuelson (1981), the reserve price serves
to extract a slightly higher price from the bidder with the highest valuation of the item
on offer. The theory of optimal auctions indicates why, for strategic reasons, a seller
should set a reserve price that is strictly higher than the minimum price for which they
would sell the object. However, these models predict that sale rates should approach
unity as the number of bidders increases and do not seem to be consistent with the low
and persistent sale rates actually observed.

28

More recently, in a general auction model with affiliated signals, common
components to valuations, and endogenous entry (all characteristics which can be
applied to art auctions or other auctions of cultural objects), McAfee, Quan, and
Vincent (2000) derive a lower bound on the optimal reserve price. They apply their
computations to FDIC real estate auctions and find that the lower bound on the
optimal reserve price for real estate to be about 75% of the appraised value.
9. Why Secret Reserve Prices?
In almost all auctions of cultural items, not only are there reserve prices, but
these reserve prices are secret. Auctioneers generally do not reveal the reserve price
and they make it as difficult as they can for bidders to infer it. A reserve price clearly
contains information about the seller’s valuation of an item; intuitively, revealing
information matters if the items contain a common value component among buyers.
While people buy art for enjoyment, there is an investment component to many
buyers’ motives; that investment component leads one to classify art as having
common-value components. Thus, the fact that auctioneers tend to keep reserve
prices secret has remained a puzzle since the publication of Milgrom and Weber’s
paper (1982), where it was shown that it is optimal for a seller of a good at a
common-value auction to reveal their valuation.
One reason that has been suggested for secret reserve prices is that these may
be used to deter collusion. As Ashenfelter (1989) suggests, when the turnout is low,
some sellers may prefer that their goods be bought in and offered for sale at a later
date rather than risk a collusive ring bidding to depress the item’s price. If there is a
ring operating, a secret reserve price might encourage bidders to bid higher than they
would have otherwise.

29

Vincent (1995) has cleverly built upon (and overturned) the intuition from
Milgrom and Weber’s (1982a) original result. His explanation is based upon the
inhibiting effect that the announcement of a reserve price may have on the
participation of bidders in a given auction. This announcement could discourage
some bidders from participating. As revelation of information is very important for
increasing revenues in a common value auction, the fact that these bidders are not
participating prevents their information from playing a part in the auction and may
lower overall bids. Hence, there is a trade-off between the reserve price revealing the
seller’s information, and a reserve price discouraging participating which lowers total
aggregation of information.
Horstmann and LaCasse (1997) provide yet another reason for secret reserve
prices. If the seller in a common-value auction possesses information that cannot be
directly transmitted to the buyers, then a seller can either attempt to signal his
information via a reserve price announcement, or choose a secret reserve price. A
secret reserve price could result in delay in sale. If the true information about an item
is revealed over time, the delay in sale could be profitable for high value items, but
costly for low value items, and hence sellers of high-value items will not be tempted
to mimic sellers of low-value items. While this explanation may appear reasonable
for oil leases, it appears less applicable to art auctions, though sellers of art are given
access to professional valuation services provided by the auction house, which may
provide an asymmetry of information. A summary of papers relating to secret reserve
prices is presented in Table 6 below.

10. Role of Estimates and Experts
Before an auction takes place, in their pre-auction catalogues, auction house
experts provide a low and a high price estimate for each item. Determining the
accuracy of these estimates raises some important questions for the study of the role
of expert opinion in economic decisions.5 Of especial interest is the motivation of the
auctioneer in choosing the high and low estimates. The theoretical literature stresses
that auctioneers should provide truthful information about the items being sold.
Ashenfelter’s (1989) results generally show that auction houses are truthful;
the average of the auctioneer’s high and low estimate is very highly correlated with
the price actually received. Furthermore, Abowd and Ashenfelter (1988) find that
auctioneer’s price estimates are far better predictors of prices fetched than hedonic
price functions.
While the regressions in Beggs and Graddy (1997) generally uphold these
results, they do find systematic under and over predictions. For example, they find
that for Contemporary Art, more recently executed artworks are overvalued and
longer and wider paintings are undervalued. For Impressionist and Modern art, they

5

Ashenfelter (2000) defines expert opinion as efficient if it incorporates all of the publicly available
information that is useful in making predictions. He also provides one example of inefficient expert
opinion.

31

find that wider, signed, and monogrammed paintings may be underestimated relative
to their value. One explanation for these findings may simply be that auction houses
are unwittingly overestimating consumer demand (and hence willingness to pay) for
recent Contemporary Art, and underestimating consumer demand for size! Many
people in the trade express surprise at the strong correlations that many economists
have found between size and price (see Anderson (1974) and Beggs and Graddy
(1997) for examples).
Other authors have also found that ex-ante valuations cannot be considered
unbiased predictors of market prices, although it is our impression that biases are not
quantitatively large when they are precisely estimated. Bauwens and Ginsburgh
(2000) study 1600 lots of English silver sold between 1976 and 1991 by Christie’s
and Sotheby’s. They find that Christie’s has a tendency to underestimate
systematically, while Sotheby’s overvalues inexpensive pieces and undervalues
expensive ones. Chanel, Gerard-Varet, and Vincent (1996) studied jewellery
auctions, and found that experts have an ex-ante valuation that is lower than the
hammer price for all types of jewels, except for some watches. They speculate that
some strategic undervaluation is occurring. These results are interesting, in part
because, as Milgrom and Weber (1982a) show, in general, for auctioneers, “honesty is
the best policy.”
If price estimates are biased, this raises some interesting questions about the
reason for the bias. One possibility is simply that the “experts” make systematic
errors because they are not as “efficient” as the linear predictors they are being tested
against. Evidence in favor of this hypothesis would be the finding that observed
biases are not stable and vary from one sample to another or from one time period to

32

another. Judging from the results reported above, there is certainly some evidence to
support this view.
Another possibility is that auctioneers engage in systematic manipulation of
the estimates for strategic purposes. The testimony of Diana Brooks, formerly
President of Sotheby’s, in the trial of Alfred Taubman noted above provides some
anecdotal evidence on this issue. Her testimony suggests that, even when the two
leading auctioneers were engaging in price fixing, they did not attempt to influence
the art appraisers who worked for them to assist in the conspiracy.
A related question is, “what motivates the auctioneers when they determine
the spread between the high and the low estimates that are published in the pre-sale
catalogues?” One explanation of how the spread is determined is by the auctioneer’s
estimate of the uncertainty or possible variance in the price of the painting. In this
case, the high estimate might reasonably be interpreted as the estimate of the mean
price plus a multiple of the estimated standard deviation (H=µ+rσ). Likewise, under
this interpretation, the low estimate would be the mean minus a multiple of the
standard deviation (L= µ-rσ). With this interpretation the high estimate minus the low
estimate divided by 2 is proportional to the estimated standard deviation ((H-L)/2= rσ)
and the average of the high estimate and the low estimate would be the estimated
mean ((H+L)/2=µ). A large difference in the high estimate and the low estimate
would therefore signal a high estimate of price variance or a lot of uncertainty.
However, as the seller’s secret reserve price, by convention, lies below the low
estimate, it is very likely that the spread between the high and low estimate is not
simply a reflection of the auctioneer’s uncertainty surrounding the possible price. If
the seller wishes to set a high reserve price, the auctioneer may increase the low
estimate. Ashenfelter, Graddy, and Stevens (2002) study the plausibility of these two

33

explanations with regard to sales rates in Contemporary and Impressionist Art
Auctions. A summary of papers addressing the role of estimates is presented in Table
7 below.

11. The Declining Price Anomaly
Since Ashenfelter (1989) showed that that prices are twice as likely to
decrease as to increase for identical bottles of wine sold in same lot sizes at auction,
there has been a tremendous amount of study of the declining price anomaly in many
types of auctions.
Soon after publication of Ashenfelter’s (1989) article, there were many
theoretical papers written to explain declining prices. Black and deMeza (1992)
claimed it was no anomaly; declining prices in wine auctions exist primarily because
the winner of the first auction in a sequence has the option to buy the remaining
objects at the winning price. However, this theory is unable to explain why the
34

anomaly continues to exist even where this option is not permitted. McAfee and
Vincent (1993) showed that risk aversion could create declining prices. One
unappealing feature of their explanation is that a pure-strategy equilibrium exists only
when there is nondecreasing absolute risk aversion, which is usually thought
implausible. Mixed strategy equilibria are ex-post inefficient, which is sometimes
also thought to be weakness of this theory, but which may nevertheless be a correct
characterization of the actual market. Von der Fehr (1994) shows that participation
costs could create declining prices through strategic bidding. Engelbrecht-Wiggans
(1994), Bernhardt and Scoones (1994), Gale and Hausch (1994), and Beggs and
Graddy (1997) relate the price decline to heterogeneity of the objects for sale,
Pezanis-Christou (2001) relates the price decline to heterogeneity among buyers, and
Ginsburgh (1998) shows that the presence of absentee bidders can generate declining
prices.
The declining price anomaly has also been documented in a number of
different types of auctions with different auction structures. Buccola (1982) found it
occurring in livestock auctions, Milgrom and Weber (1982b) for transponder leases,
McAfee and Vincent (1993) and Di Vittorio and Ginsburgh (1994) confirmed
Ashenfelter’s (1989) wine findings, Thiel and Petry (1990) and Taylor(1991) in stamp
auctions, Ashenfelter and Genesove (1992) and Venderporten (1992a, 1992b) for
condominiums, Engelbrecht-Wiggans and Kahn (1992) for dairy cattle, Lusht (1994)
for commercial real estate, Chanel, Gerard-Varet, and Vincent (1996) for gold
jewellery; Pesando and Shum (1996) for Picasso prints; Beggs and Graddy (1997) for
Impressionist and Contemporary art; Thurston (1997) for mink pelts, PezanisChristou (2001) for fish auctions, and van den Berg, van Ours and Pradhan (2001) for

35

Dutch flower auctions. Burns (1985) and Keser and Olson (1996) have set up
experiments that have reached the same conclusions.
Several authors have also found increasing prices. Among them are Gandal
(1997) for Israeli cable television licenses, and Donald, Paarsch and Robert (1997) for
Siberian timber-export permits. Jones, Menezes and Vella (1996) found that prices
could increase or decrease in sequential auctions of wool, as did Chanel, GerardVaret, and Vincent (1996) for watches; Milgrom and Weber (1982b) show
theoretically that if bidders’ valuations are affiliated, then prices will tend to rise over
time in a sequence of auctions of identical objects. Deltas and Kosmopoulou (2001)
find in a sale of library books that expected prices increase over the auction, but that
probability of sale decreases. Natzkoff (2001) provides an excellent survey of papers
on the declining price anomaly. A summary of papers addressing the declining price
anomaly is presented in Table 8 below.

Conclusion
The empirical study of art auctions really has two purposes. On the one hand,
the auction mechanism provides a very public report on the prices of art objects. As
we have shown, because of the unique nature of many art objects, the interpretation of
market prices requires great care. Nevertheless, this information is the primary way
that art objects are valued and it provides us with our primary objective information
on preferences regarding art. Although the market is surely not all that is important in
the judgement of art and artists, it is certainly one of the key components of our
understanding of what is good and bad
The empirical study of art auctions also has another purpose. Art auctions
provide data that may be used to test and refine strategic models of behavior. Here

36

the object of study is the economic mechanism and it makes very little difference
what object is for sale. It appears that a great deal of what we know about the
operation of auction mechanisms may also lead to the rather happy study of objects of
considerable interest in their own right.
The empirical study of art auctions and the price of art assets has been a
growth field in the last decade and has resulted in an increasing sophistication in the
questions being asked and in the empirical methods being used. It seems likely that
this trend will continue into the future.
