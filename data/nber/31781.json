    "abstract": "\n\nWe study the diffusion of a clinically unproven treatment for COVID-19 in Argentina. As the pandemic spread, nebulized ibuprofen reached thousands of patients, even some seriously ill, despite warnings by the regulator and medical societies. We use daily data on drug deliveries for all towns in one of the largest provinces to study diffusion patterns and find a role for learning. An experimental survey is also consistent with learning. A key dimension affecting diffusion is ideology: towns and subjects classified as \u201cright-wing\u201d are more likely to adopt and to learn.\n\n",
