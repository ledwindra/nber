Financial Literacy and Financial Sophistication Among Older Americans

NBER Working Paper No. 15469
November 2009
JEL No. D14
ABSTRACT
This paper analyzes new data on financial literacy and financial sophistication from the 2008 Health
and Retirement Study. We show that financial literacy is lacking among older individuals and for
the first time explore additional questions on financial sophistication which proves even scarcer. For
this sample of older respondents over the age of 55, we find that people lack even a rudimentary understanding
of stock and bond prices, risk diversification, portfolio choice, and investment fees. In view of the
fact that individuals are increasingly required to take on responsibility for their own retirement security,
this lack of knowledge has serious implications.

Financial Literacy and Financial Sophistication
Among Older Americans
Annamaria Lusardi, Olivia S. Mitchell, and Vilsa Curto

Research Question and Relevance
Financial literacy among Americans is disappointingly low. For instance, only half of
older respondents surveyed in a special module of the 2004 Health and Retirement Study (HRS)
could correctly answer two simple questions regarding inflation and compound interest. Only
one-third correctly answered these two questions as well as a third question about risk
diversification (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2006, 2008a). Evidence of low numeracy and low financial
sophistication is also evident for younger respondents (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2007a; Lusardi,
Mitchell and Curto, 2009) in surveys including the Rand American Life Panel (ALP) and the
Survey of Consumers (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2007c; Hilgert, Hogarth, and Beverly, 2003).
Financial illiteracy is also particularly acute among specific demographic sub-groups, such as
women, minorities, and those with low income and education (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2007b,
2008a). Lack of financial literacy has important consequences; those who lack literacy are much
less likely to plan for retirement (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2006, 2007a, 2007c), are more likely to
end up with less wealth close to retirement (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2007a), are less likely to invest
in stocks (van Rooij, Lusardi and Alessie, 2007; Kimball and Shumway, 2006; Yoong , 2007),
and are more likely to use high-cost means of borrowing (Lusardi and Tufano, 2009).
This paper analyzes new data from the 2008 HRS on financial literacy and financial
sophistication.1 We assess levels of financial sophistication among older individuals, specifically

paper.

This module was designed by Miles Kimball and Tyler Shumway in collaboration with the authors of this

2

persons over the age of 55 in 2008. Many prior studies focused on simple measures of basic
financial literacy and did not consider financial sophistication. Our research is informative for
policy in several ways. First, results from this research can be used to design financial education
programs that are more effective in fostering financial literacy and saving. By examining
knowledge about the behavior of the stock market, basic asset pricing, and the importance of
mutual fund fees on long-term investments, explicit suggestions can be provided regarding topics
that should be covered in financial education programs. Second, this paper identifies which
population groups are most likely to be financially unsophisticated. Third, the analysis indicates
which groups are most prone to poor financial decision-making at older ages and provides some
suggestions for improving the effectiveness of financial education programs.

Prior Research
Older Americans are not particularly financially literate, as shown by Lusardi and
Mitchell (2006) using data from a special-purpose module the authors created for the 2004 HRS.
These findings have been confirmed among Early Baby Boomers, who displayed not only low
numeracy, but also a lack of knowledge of fundamental economic concepts such as interest rate
compounding (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2007a). Moreover, particular sub-groups of the population
suffer even greater deficits in financial literacy; Lusardi and Mitchell (2008a) find that women
display much lower literacy than men and are much less likely to plan for retirement.
Furthermore, minorities and those with low education and low income are more likely to display
low levels of financial knowledge (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2007b; Lusardi, 2008b; Smith and
Stewart, 2008).

3

These results are troublesome given the increasing complexity of financial instruments
and the many transactions households must undertake that require sound economic
understanding. For instance, Moore (2003) found that mortgage borrowers in Washington State
knew little about compound interest and were confused about the terms of their mortgages.
Campbell (2006) found that many households failed to refinance their mortgages over the 2001–
2003 period, when interest rates were falling.
Furthermore, financial illiteracy can have significant long-term financial consequences
(Lusardi, 2008a). For example, those who underestimate the power of interest compounding are
more likely to end up with excessive amounts of debt (Lusardi and Tufano, 2009). Those who
fail to refinance or to correctly estimate the amount by which interest rates could change will pay
significantly more in mortgage interest (Campbell, 2006).

Data and Methodology
Most of the financial literacy studies mentioned above have drawn on evidence gathered
in a short experimental module in the 2004 HRS designed by Lusardi and Mitchell. 2 This set of
questions has been used very successfully to explore the links between financial literacy and
retirement planning as well as retirement wealth accumulation. Nevertheless, that module
included only three questions designed to assess basic numeracy and knowledge of basic
economic concepts such as inflation and risk diversification. For this reason, we have sought to
expand the scope of investigation into financial knowledge among the older population with
additional questions added to other surveys. For instance we have developed questions on
financial knowledge in the American Life Panel which we first piloted on the Dutch DNB

2

These questions have now been added to related surveys in Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Russia, New
Zealand, Japan, Chile, and Mexico, revealing similar patterns of widespread illiteracy.

4

Household Survey (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2007c; van Rooij, Lusardi and Alessie, 2007). These
new measures cover not only basic but also sophisticated financial knowledge, eliciting
knowledge on the difference between bonds and stocks, the working of the stock market, and
basic asset pricing. In turn, this expanded set of data about financial knowledge then influenced
the wording of the new module for the 2008 HRS, to be described in more detail below. Using
this extended information, we can now classify respondents not only in terms of basic financial
literacy but also in terms of financial sophistication.
An interesting aspect of the 2008 HRS module on financial literacy is its innovative
approach to assessing how the literacy questions are designed. Not only is there a richer list of
questions compared to the 2004 HRS, but also respondents are presented with alternative
question wording to assess whether respondents are guessing or whether they actually understand
the questions. Specifically, respondents are randomly chosen to be presented with the same
questions but with reverse wording. For example, one set of respondents is asked whether the
following statement is true or false: “If you invest for the long run, the annual fees of mutual
funds are important;” the second group is asked: “If you invest for the long run, the annual fees
of mutual funds are unimportant.” Such wording reversal permits us to begin to evaluate the
extent of measurement error in responses to financial sophistication questions. This is a very
important methodological innovation. Both the Dutch DNB Household Survey and the ALP used
a similar approach for a small subset of the questions, and there we showed that the wording of
the questions does matter, particularly for questions measuring financial sophistication (Lusardi
and Mitchell, 2007c, 2009; van Rooij, Lusardi and Alessie, 2007). In general, if people are
financially unsophisticated, it will be difficult to elicit accurate responses to unfamiliar concepts.

5

Measuring Financial Sophistication
In 2008, a subset of some 1332 HRS respondents responded to a battery of questions
seeking to assess their knowledge of the stock market, asset pricing, investment strategies, risk
diversification, the importance of fees, financial attitudes and related topics. Because so many
questions are asked to respondents, we have organized them into five different sub-groups
according to the topics they cover, as follows (exact question wording appears in the Appendix):
(A) Knowledge of capital markets
V407 Understanding of the stock market
V408 Investment in company stocks
V408 Avoidance of foreign stocks
V416 Bond value versus interest rate
(B) Risk diversification
V411 Invest in few stocks
V417 Stock risk spread
V419 Diversify stocks
(C) Knowledge of fees
V415 Importance of annual fees
V418 Asset annual fees
(D) Savvy/numeracy
V412 Buy/sell stocks often
V413 Enough life insurance

6

V422 Use savings in bank to pay off credit cards
V423 Power of interest compounding
(E) Attitudes toward investing and risk
V406 All money in safest asset
V410 Whether older retired should hold stocks
V420 Smart people select stocks with good return
V421 Stock market equals lottery
V424 Advisors take unfair advantage
Respondents to this module were, on average, age 67, with about 55% female. About
16% had less than high school education, 33% had high school, 24% had some college, and 28%
had college or advanced degrees. The majority, 81%, of the respondents was White, 9% AfricanAmerican, and 8% Hispanic. Summary statistics on outcomes appear in Tables 1-5, and detail by
sex, age, and education in Tables 6-9.

A. Knowledge of capital markets
Recalling that this module was fielded in 2008, a year of particularly volatile capital
markets, it is probably not surprising that a large majority of respondents reported that they did
not understand this market; only about 30% said they did. Nevertheless the degree of financially
illiteracy extends much more broadly, supporting the view that older Americans lack an
understanding of key concepts related to stock prices, risk diversification, and portfolio choice
(Table 1). For instance, many respondents expressed a preference for having some company
stocks, though there is some sensitivity to the way the question was asked. Respondents given
the first wording of this question (whether an employee of a company with publicly traded stock

7

should have a lot of his/her retirement savings in the company stock) did believe that holding a
lot a company stocks is not a good idea. Yet when presented with the reverse wording, most
rejected the idea of holding little or no money in company stock. Since the typical worker will
have a large part of his total wealth in human capital which is highly correlated with his
employer’s financial stability, it is likely to be unwise from a risk diversification viewpoint to
hold own employer stock.
The results also show that respondents were wary of investing in international equity.
Experts have long argued that international diversification helps diversify risk and offers
exposure to fast-growing foreign economies. Nevertheless, many prior studies have found
evidence of “home bias,” and this is also evident among older respondents (French and Poterba,
1991). It is interesting that the wording of the question matters: respondents were more likely to
display financial sophistication when they were asked if it is best to avoid stocks of foreign
companies, rather than if it is a good idea to own stocks of foreign companies.
Table 1 also shows that a large majority of respondents did not know about asset pricing,
which we have tested by asking whether people know about the inverse relationship between
bond prices and interest rates. This is a particularly good question to assess financial
sophistication because, while some questions may be answered correctly if people are good at
math or are clever and can figure out an answer, it is hard if not impossible to know or infer the
correct answer to this question without having some knowledge of finance. When we piloted this
question in both the ALP and the Dutch DNB, we found that a small share (fewer than half) of
respondents knew about bond pricing, and also the wording of this question mattered. We
confirm this finding for the present module as well. When presented with the statement if interest
rates fall, bond prices will rise, only about one-third (36%) of respondents answered correctly;

8

the wording was reversed and people were asked if interest rates fall, bond prices will fall , many
more are correct. This may be due to guessing, since a sizable proportion of respondents (as
many as 23%) reported they did not know the answer to this question.3 Note too that answers to
these questions are not highly correlated and only 6% could respond correctly to all four
questions. Moreover, more than a fourth answered “do not know” to at least one of the questions.

B. Knowledge of risk diversification
Knowledge of risk diversification is very important when contemplating investment
options. Table 2 shows that many respondents (over 60%) seemed to know that it is not a good
idea to invest in a few stocks rather than in many stocks or in mutual funds, which may imply
some sophistication about risk. Moreover, the large majority seemed to know that spreading
money across 20 stocks rather than two decreases the risk of losing money. Yet again the way
both questions are worded matters, indicating that some respondents were simply guessing. We
hypothesize that some of the sensitivity to how the questions are asked could be due to economic
terminology. For instance, many respondents may not know what a mutual fund is or the fact that
mutual funds contain many stocks. Finally, close to half of the respondents agreed that by
diversifying, one could invest more in stocks; now there is little sensitivity to question wording,
perhaps because this question does not require much knowledge beyond what a stock is.
While each individual question seems to indicate some knowledge and understanding of
risk diversification, only one-third (32%) of respondents answered correctly to all three questions
and 23% responded “do not know” to at least one question, showing that their knowledge was
limited to one specific concept.
3

In prior research we have found that those who respond that they “do not know” are also
those who are least financially knowledgeable (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2006).

9

C. Knowledge of fees
Two questions in the module seek to assess peoples’ knowledge of fees associated with
investments; see Table 3. This is important since higher fees erode retirement wealth, yet prior
studies have shown that investors often overlook fees when deciding how to invest (Choi,
Laibson and Madrian, 2009; Mitchell, Todd and Bravo, 2008). In our sample, a sizable
percentage (60%) seemed to know that mutual fund fees are important when investing for the
long run, but the responses are sensitive to the wording of the questions, perhaps due to the fact
that the respondent would have to know both about mutual funds and what investing for the long
run means. Note also that a large majority of respondents found it difficult to locate mutual funds
with annual fees of less than one percent of assets, suggesting that many respondents may not
know about indexed funds. Moreover, only about one-quarter (28%) of respondents evinced
some financial sophistication with respect to fees by answering both questions correctly, while
more than 30% responded “do not know” to at least one of these two questions.

D. Savvy/numeracy
While it is important to evaluate whether people know about fees, it is also important to
know whether they pursue behaviors that could reduce fees. Table 4 shows what respondents
knew regarding the question of whether “to make money in the market they should not buy and
sell stocks too often.” Most respondents (over 60%) seemed to be savvy with regard to buying
and selling stocks. Similarly, many respondents (almost 70%) were savvy about life insurance
and, for example, knew that replacing three years of income would be inadequate coverage for a
family with a working husband and a wife who stays home to take care of young children. Most

10

respondents also knew that using money in a bank account to pay off credit card debt is usually a
good idea.
Probably due to their simplicity, those questions elicit responses that are insensitive to
question wording. This is, however, not the case for a different query asked to assess whether
people know about the power of interest compounding and their ability to do rather complex
calculations involving interest rates. Over half seemed to be able to figure out that an initial
investment of $1,000 would grow more than six-fold when invested at an interest rate of 10% for
30 years. Nevertheless the alternative wording generates different answers, so at least some were
guessing. Moreover, only one quarter (22%) were able to give correct answers to all four
questions, and another quarter (22%) responded with “do not know” to at least one of these
questions.

E. Attitudes toward investing and risk
Other questions in the module measure financial attitudes; see Table 5. One focuses on
older persons’ willingness to accept investment risk. It is interesting that a large majority of the
older respondents (68%) did not agree that “one should put all money into the safest investment
and accept whatever return it pays,” a notable finding given the timing of the survey. And most
respondents thought that even older retired households should hold some stocks, a finding very
much in line with the willingness to accept some risk displayed in the responses to the first
question. Many respondents were also aware that “even if one is smart, it is very difficult to pick
individual stocks that will have better than average returns.” In the latter case, however,
responses were vastly different depending on how the question was asked. Most respondents also

11

knew that investing in the stock market is better than buying lottery tickets, and that it is
incorrect to think that one has to be taken advantage of when investing in the stock market.
While responses to these questions do seem to pick up some sophistication among
respondents, the fact that the question wording matters so much casts some doubt on whether
respondents were informed or simply guessing. Furthermore, since only one fifth of respondents
could answer all questions correctly and one fifth responded “do not know” to at least one
question, the evidence is indicative of widespread shortcomings in financial sophistication.

Who Knows the Least?
As shown above, there is some evidence of financial sophistication when assessing the
answers to a large set of questions, but sophistication seems limited to a specific concept and the
fraction of respondents that can be considered sophisticated, at least judging from their responses
to this set of questions, is hardly above 25%. Next we explore how responses to these questions
vary by sex, education, age, and race/ethnicity.
Table 6 shows that older women were substantially less likely than older men to report
they understood the stock market reasonably well. And while they did not differ much in how
they would invest in company stock, women were more likely to avoid investing in foreign
stocks. Moreover, they were less likely to be knowledgeable about asset pricing, i.e., the
relationship between bond prices and interest rates. They were also less knowledgeable than men
about risk diversification; for example, they were less likely to know that spreading money
across many stocks decreases the risk of losing money. This raises the question of whether some
of the attitudes toward risk that women display are due to preferences or to financial
sophistication.

12

In terms of knowledge about fees, women were similar to men and sometimes they
seemed to know more. Further, their financial savvy was similar to men’s and in some cases,
they were more knowledgeable about adequate life insurance and how to be savvy about credit
cards. Nevertheless, women performed substantially less well in terms of numeracy and complex
calculations than men, confirming our findings from other surveys (Mitchell and Lusardi, 2006,
2008, 2009). We also note that the attitudes of women were not very different from those of men,
and while women tended to score a little lower than men in these questions, differences were
often not statistically significant.
Overall, there was a gender gap in terms of financial sophistication between women and
men. Women were less knowledgeable about some of the complex concepts of finance and
investing, such as the working of the stock market, risk diversification, and asset pricing. They
also had more difficulty in doing complex calculations. Because women were more likely to
respond that they do not know the answers to the questions, they are more likely to be classified
among those with low knowledge. Of course, awareness of lack of knowledge could help women
acquire knowledge or become more active in seeking for help and counseling (Lusardi, Keller
and Keller, 2008).
Table 7 reports how financial sophistication varies by educational level. Overall, the
proportion of sophisticated respondents increases monotonically as we move to higher
educational attainment and it is highest for those with at least a college degree. Some of the
differences are quite staggering. For example, only 14% of those with less than a high school
degree stated that they know how the stock market works reasonably well. For those with at
least a college degree the percentages are far higher, though even here, fewer than half agreed
with this assessment. These are worrisome statistics, in view of the shift in responsibility from

13

employers to workers for saving and investing retirement wealth. Similarly, only one third (31%)
of respondents with less than a high school degree thought it was a good idea to invest in foreign
stocks; the share increases steadily across higher levels of education and more than doubles
(66%) among those with a college degree. This suggests that financial sophistication can be an
important determinant not only of stock market participation but also of the types of portfolios
that investors hold. Similarly, we find that the knowledge of asset pricing was very low among
those with less than a high school degree (23.5%), while it increased to more than 50% for the
college educated.
Across all questions measuring risk diversification, there is a steep education gradient, so
the financially sophisticated tend be the most educated. This is true even for questions that do not
use economic terminology (e.g. do not require knowing what a mutual fund is and how it
operates). For example, the least educated were much less likely to know that holding 20 rather
than two stocks decreases the risk of losing a lot of money.
With respect to fees, less educated respondents were unlikely to be aware of the
importance of fees, but there are no significant differences across educational grouping as to the
difficulty of finding low-cost mutual funds. We take this to imply that knowledge of indexed
funds is not widespread even among the educated, and/or that search and time costs are high for
most groups. Financial savvy was lower among those with less education; those respondents
were less skillful in doing complex calculations and in credit card debt management, a finding
consistent with other surveys (Lusardi and Tufano, 2009). It probably means that those with the
least knowledge will pay higher interest rates on their debt. It may be that the tendency to invest
in the safest investment is a proxy for having little knowledge, rather than risk aversion.

14

Responses to the financial sophistication questions also differed across age groups; see
Table 7. Few over age 75 understood the working of the stock market or were willing to buy
foreign stock, perhaps reflecting the fact of limited exposure to stock markets. Knowledge about
risk diversification declined steadily with age: older respondents were much less likely to know
how to decrease risk when investing in stocks, even when questions were phrased simply. Many
respondents stated that fees were important, but older respondents found it more difficult to
locate low-fee mutual funds. This might be due to their lesser facility with the internet or reduced
cognitive ability. People age 75+ seemed less savvy as well; they were less likely to know that
one loses money by trading stocks often or how to manage credit card debt, and they were less
likely to be correct in complex calculations about interest compounding. Older investors were
also more wary of being taken advantage of in the stock market, consistent with their lower
levels of financial sophistication.
In Table 9 we summarize differences across race/ethnicity. Knowledge about the stock
market low was particularly low among African-Americans and Hispanics, where only 21% and
15%, respectively, reported that they understood the stock market reasonably well. This lesser
knowledge was also apparent in responses to questions about company stock, foreign stocks, and
asset pricing. Sharp differences in knowledge also emerged regarding risk diversification. Even
when questions did not refer to concepts such as mutual funds, the percentage of respondents
knowing about risk diversification was much lower among African-Americans and Hispanics.
Nonwhites were also less likely to know about adequate life insurance, that stock market trading
is costly, and that is a good idea to pay off credit cards with bank saving. They were also less
likely to be correct in calculations involving interest compounding. Some of the answers to these
questions may simply pick up the limited experience that respondents have with stocks and

15

bonds, and also with credit cards. Note also that the attitudes of African-Americans and
Hispanics differed markedly from those of White respondents. For example, Hispanics were
substantially more likely to think they should put all of their money in the safest investment they
can find and accept whatever return it pays. Moreover, they were more likely to think that
“investing in the stock market is no better than buying lottery tickets,” and that “there is no way
to avoid people taking advantage of you if you invest in the stock market.” These findings are
supportive of prior surveys on differences in financial literacy by race/ethnicity (Lusardi and
Mitchell, 2006, 2007a, 2007b, 2009).

Implications
In this paper, and in much of our earlier work, we have found substantial shortfalls in
older persons’ levels of financial literacy and financial sophistication. The value-added of the
present research is to illuminate key areas where more could be done to inform, educate, and
deepen peoples’ understanding of what must be done to diversify investments, reduce costs, and
make retirement saving more effective. We have used an extensive module fielded in the 2008
HRS to explore knowledge about capital markets and risk diversification, knowledge of fees,
financial savvy/numeracy, and attitudes toward investing and risk. We also exploit differences in
question wording to gain insight into whether respondents are guessing or actually know the
answers to the questions posed.
For this sample of older respondents over the age of 55, we find that people lack even a
rudimentary understanding of stock and bond prices, risk diversification, portfolio choice, and
investment fees. Furthermore, people that got one question correct were not particularly likely to
get others correct, and “do not know” responses were quite widespread. Simpler questions that

16

avoided economic jargon were easier to answer. We also conclude that the way in which the
questions were framed mattered: for instance, 38% answered correctly when asked to opine on
the following statement:“it is easy to pick individual company stock that will have better than
average returns” whereas 74% answered correctly when the reverse wording was offered “it is
hard to pick individual company stock that will have better than average returns.” This suggests
that more research is needed on the way in which financial sophistication questions are framed,
to evaluate whether and how to help people develop a fuller understanding of how retirement
saving and investment work.
This analysis may be of use to those working to enhance retirement security. It is clear
that employees and retirees are increasingly being asked to take on tasks requiring financial
sophistication, including making saving, investment, and dissaving decisions for retirement. Our
research suggests that it may be particularly important to build human capital via retirement,
educational programs, and retirement planning products. Nevertheless, one-size-fits-all programs
are unlikely to successfully address saving shortfalls particularly among the elderly, given the
very different patterns we have discerned by sex, age, educational levels, and race/ethnicity. Our
research suggests that programs targeted to address fundamental differences in preferences,
saving needs, and financial knowledge as well as sophistication, could be more effective.
