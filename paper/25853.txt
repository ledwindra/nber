ABSTRACT
We investigate whether top managers affect the performance of large and complex public sector
organizations, using as a case study CEOs of English public hospitals (large, complex
organizations with multi-million turnover). We study the extent to which CEOs are differentiated
in terms of their pay, as well as a wide range of hospital production measures including inputs,
intermediate operational outcomes and clinical outcomes. Pay differentials suggest that the
market perceives CEOs to be differentiated. However, we find little evidence of CEOs’ impact on
hospital production. These results question the effectiveness of leadership changes to improve
performance in the public sector.

Introduction

The impact of CEOs in private sector organizations has been explored in a number of
influential studies beginning with Bertrand & Schoar (2003).1 Several recent papers have
shown that CEOs can also impact the performance of public sector organizations. This
result, however, has only been documented for relatively small organizations such as
schools and development projects, where top managers may have a greater chance of
having an impact.2 In contrast, the effect of top managers on large and complex public
sector organizations has hardly even been examined. Can CEOs make a difference in
this context? Addressing this question is important because a popular reform model
in the public sector is to give greater autonomy to CEOs to run their organizations,
accompanied by the use of manager-specific compensation policies, performance-related
pay, tighter monitoring and dismissals (e.g. Besley & Ghatak (2003), Grand (2003)).
We contribute to the literature by examining the impact of CEOs of very large and
complex organizations in the public sector. We study public hospitals in the English
National Health Service (NHS). The NHS is the fifth biggest employer in the world with
approximately 1.2 million employees, and NHS hospitals have on average 4,500 employees,
multi-million turnover and labour costs accounting for around 70% of the costs of production. This setting is an ideal test-bed for several reasons. First, in the late 1980s the
English government embarked on a large reform program that replaced an administrative
approach to hospital management with a highly decentralized managerial model, in which
CEOs were given responsibility for the management and performance of individual public
hospitals, and individual hospital boards could select and reward individual CEOs in an
autonomous fashion.3 These changes were accompanied by frequent movements of the
same CEOs across different but comparable NHS hospitals, providing an ideal setting to
examine the role of managerial discretion for hospital performance in isolation from other
persistent differences in hospital characteristics. Second, data are available for these individual NHS hospitals on inputs, throughputs, outputs (both clinical and financial) and

Recent examples include Bamber et al. (2010), Dejong & Ling (2013) and Bennedsen et al. (2006).
A number of papers investigate the impact of principals on student performance. Böhlmark et al.
(2016) present evidence of principal fixed effects in students’ outcomes. Other papers include Branch
et al. (2012), Coelli & Green (2012) and Grissom et al. (2015). Lavy & Boiko (2017) find that superintendents affect student performance. Bloom, Lemos, Sadun & Van Reenen (2015) find managerial practices
adopted by school principals are correlated with school performance. Fenizia (2019) finds managers affect
the productivity of workers in a government agency. Limodio (2018) examines World Bank employees
and documents evidence of negative matching between high performing managers and low performing
countries. Rasul & Rogger (2018) examine management practice in the Nigerian Civil Service and find
they affect the behaviour of government bureaucrats.

Similar reforms were adopted in a number of public healthcare systems and in public administration
more generally (Pollitt & Bouckaert 2000).

staff satisfaction, allowing us to examine a uniquely large and varied set of measures
usually unavailable to researchers examining organizations in both the private and the
public sector. Third, the NHS requires hospitals to publish the pay awarded to their top
managers, thus allowing us to complement the performance analysis with an examination
of CEO compensation and compare perceived differences in managerial ability (as proxied by their compensation) to actual differences (as they emerge from the analysis of the
objective production measures).
We begin by showing that there are considerable and persistent differences in managerial pay by implementing the approach of Abowd et al. (1999). Moving from the 25th
percentile to the 75th percentile of the CEO pay effects distribution represents a 12%
increase in pay relative to mean CEO pay. These persistent differences in pay across
individuals suggest that managers are perceived to be differentiated by their employers.
We then turn to examining whether CEOs are differentiated in terms of their actual
performance. To do so, we use the method pioneered by Bertrand & Schoar (2003) and
examine whether CEOs have a “style” regardless of the hospital they manage by testing
whether there are statistically significant and “portable” CEO fixed effects, i.e. systematic
differences in hospital production that are associated with the movement of CEOs across
different hospitals. We extend the Bertrand & Schoar (2003) method and “stack” our
hospital production variables into distinct sets of input, throughput, output (clinical and
financial) and staff job satisfaction measures to take advantage of the fact we have multiple
measures of production, and to simplify the exposition of our results while maximizing the
number of observations. Our results show little consistent evidence that CEOs are able to
generate persistent performance differentials across the organizations they lead. While we
find the estimated CEO fixed effects are jointly statistically significant, these CEO fixed
effects are essentially period-hospital-specific shocks rather than true CEO effects, since
large deviations in one production measure in one hospital are typically not replicated by
the same CEO in another hospital.4
We examine a number of possible reasons for this apparent lack of CEO effects in
hospital production, which is in contrast with the substantial and persistent differences
in pay. First, we examine whether the lack of persistence in the CEO fixed effects may
be driven by the endogenous assignment of good CEOs to poorly performing hospitals,
or hospitals that have structural features that may negatively affect the possibility of
achieving good performance. If this were the case, differences in pay across CEOs would
4

We repeat all analyses for each variable separately and show that the results are not sensitive to
the use of stacking. We also undertake a non-parametric approach that compares changes in hospital
production measures after a CEO turnover event to changes experienced by matched hospitals without
such an event. The results confirm the parametric findings and are reported in Appendix B.

not necessarily be mirrored by differences in hospital production, since the best CEOs
would be systematically assigned to harder-to-change organizations. Second, we examine
whether the lack of persistent CEO effects may be driven by the fact that mover CEOs
in the NHS tend to have short tenure. In this case, CEOs may in fact differ in terms
of their potential effect on hospital performance, but these effects may fail to materialize
over short time horizons. Finally, we examine whether there is evidence of CEO-hospital
match effects, i.e. whether specific types of CEO may perform better when in a specific
type of hospital, which would imply that CEOs matter, but only when the fit between the
manager and the hospital is appropriate. We find little evidence of endogenous assignment.
We do, however, find some evidence of tenure and match effects, which–combined with
the evidence of substantial and persistent pay differentials–suggest that employers may
overestimate the ability of CEOs to bring about change over short time periods and/or
regardless of the circumstances they face.
Our results indicate that the CEOs of large public hospitals do not necessarily impact
hospital performance, a result that stands in stark contrast with earlier findings relating
to the private sector and to smaller public sector organizations. Various structural factors
may account for this lack of effect, including the public sector nature of the NHS, which
may have distorted the effort of NHS CEOs towards the pursuit of political targets rather
than performance-enhancing policies. However, the lack of a CEO effect may also be
due, more broadly, to the complexity of hospital production, which transcends the fact
that the NHS is publicly owned. From this perspective, our results cast doubts on the
effectiveness of a “turnaround CEO” approach–the model in which top managers frequently
rotate across hospitals to induce meaningful changes in performance–for large public sector
organizations.
Section 2 provides an overview of the institutional background, focusing on the evolution of the market for CEOs in the NHS. Section 3 describes the data. Section 4 presents
the econometric methods used to identify CEO fixed effects in the pay and hospital production data. Section 5 present the results of the analysis of CEO fixed effects. Section
6 examines possible mechanisms behind the results. Section 7 concludes.

2.1

Institutional Background
Hospital Autonomy and the CEO Role in the English NHS

From the early 1990s, English public hospitals started operating as free-standing organizations known as NHS Hospital Trusts, earning their revenue from contracts won in

4

competition with other public hospitals. From the early 2000s, the government sought to
further stimulate competition by placing contracts with a small number of private hospitals, known as Independent Sector Treatment Centres (ISTCs), that provided a selected
set of planned operations and diagnostic tests. This policy was later expanded to include
any private provider for all elective treatments.5 The overall policy goal was for English
NHS hospitals to operate subject to market forces rather than central guidance. Within
this general policy framework, which applied to all hospitals, if a hospital achieved certain
targets (relating primarily to financial performance and access) they were formally given
a higher level of autonomy, known as Foundation Trust (FT) status. The aim was that
all Trusts would get FT status by 2008, though in practice this was not achieved.6
These policy changes were supported by significant reforms to the management of hospitals which gradually replaced a consensus management system with a general manager
who had overall responsibility for service performance and management (Baggott 1994).7
During the wave of mid-1990s market reforms, these general managers were renamed
Chief Executives, and hospitals started being subject to corporate governance standards
similar to the ones brought into private sector firms in the UK in 1992 (Cadbury 1992).
The role of hospital boards was strengthened, and they became responsible for managing
the day-to-day operation of a hospital. Trust boards had to include the Chief Executive,
a Finance Director, a Nursing Director and a Medical Director, but could have more
positions.8 These executive positions were matched by their non-executive director counterparts, who were hired with the expectation that they would need to dedicate at least
three days a month to the hospital.9 They were also, in contrast to the USA, remunerated. Boards generally met monthly (Jha & Epstein 2013) and were hands-on in terms of
monitoring of the financial performance and the quality of care provided by the hospital.10
5

ISTCs were privately owned and specialised in the provision of a limited set of planned treatments
such as hip replacements or cataract procedures. ISTCs initially received favourable five-year contracts
with revenue that did not vary with the number of patients treated (Naylor & Gregory 2009) but later
on all providers (public or private) were paid according to the same DRG type tariffs.
6
By the end of our sample period, 62% of hospitals in our sample had FT status. We control for FT
status in all regressions in the paper.
7
The initial push in favor of general managers and private sector managerial practices more broadly for
the NHS came from the Griffiths’ report of 1983 (Lord Griffiths was at the time the Deputy Chairman of
the supermarket chain J. Sainsbury plc, and was tasked by Margaret Thatcher to study the management
of the NHS).
8
Good practice for NHS boards is set out in https://www.leadershipacademy.nhs.uk/wp-content/
uploads/2013/06/NHSLeadership-HealthyNHSBoard-2013.pdf. A statutory instrument (http://www.
legislation.gov.uk) sets out the board voting members.
9
The minimum number of non-executive directors was a Chair and three others.
10
Jha & Epstein (2013) found that approximately 40% of Boards had received formal training in
quality management and that they frequently reviewed and monitored quality of care issues. 98% of
Boards reported that quality of care was on agenda at every board meeting, 77% reported to actively use

5

In addition to managing day-to-day hospital operations, Chief Executives and their
boards were also responsible for delivering government policy, which was embodied both
in targets and in guidance. Performance against targets was subject to close scrutiny
by central government. During most of the period we study, targets were predominantly
focused on financial performance and reducing waiting times.11 From 2001 onwards, the
central government regulator published hospital ratings, which were based on detailed
quantitative data on both financial and process metrics. From 2011 the targets started
including clinical quality metrics.12 Missing key performance targets could place a CEO
under threat of dismissal. Ballantine et al. (2008) document a strong association between
a limited number of hospital performance measures and CEO turnover between 1998 and
2005. In sum, NHS CEOs were responsible for both meeting government targets and
day-to-day operations of large and complex organizations that operate in a potentially
competitive market.13

2.2

CEO Selection, Hiring and Remuneration

Boards had guidance from the central government regulator on making senior appointments, including the CEO. CEOs were hired in a manner similar to those of private sector
firms. The Chair of the Board and the appointment committee would generally use private
sector headhunters for the selection and hiring of the CEO. They would also either consult
with, or include, a representative from the national government organization responsible
for overseeing the NHS.14 CEOs had career paths that involved movement between different parts of the NHS. CEOs were predominantly individuals who had entered the NHS
relatively early in their career (either as managers or as clinicians) and promotion was
often achieved by moving between organizations in the NHS. Thus, a typical CEO would
have considerable experience of working across a number of NHS organizations. However,
individuals who had private sector experience (either as private consultants in the health
sector or in running private sector organizations) were also sometimes appointed to CEO
positions. There was also movement of CEOs to the private sector, often to posts within
patient safety data to provide staff feedback.
11
For example, achieving FT status was conditional on meeting these targets. Propper et al. (2010)
provide details on waiting times targets and their impact on performance.
12
The focus on clinical quality was the result of an extensive investigation into systemic failure at a
single hospital, Mid-Staffordshire, which revealed appalling clinical and operational practices. The final
recommendations were published in 2013 in https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/reportof-the-mid-staffordshire-nhs-foundation-trust-public-inquiry.
13
Bloom, Propper, Seiler & van Reenen (2015) show that NHS hospital management quality responds
positively to greater product market competition.
14
Non-FT hospitals had to include a representative of the central government regulator.

6

the wider healthcare sector.
CEO remuneration was set by the Board. From 2003 hospitals that had achieved FT
status were free to set CEO and other executive and non-executive director pay, decided
upon by the remuneration committee as in any private company.15 The remuneration
committee could also decide whether to link CEO (and other director) remuneration to
corporate and individual performance. Performance, particularly against government targets, could affect CEO pay, job tenure and future rewards. Poorly performing CEOs could
be dismissed and well performing CEOs rewarded by appointment to a more prestigious
NHS (or private sector) organization. In addition, good performance could also be recognized by the award of a national public honour granted by the Head of State. In contrast,
the pay of clinical staff (including physicians) and lower level managerial staff in all NHS
hospitals was (and is) set at national level (with some regional uplifts) by a public sector
pay review body and was therefore essentially the same across all hospitals.

2.3

Changes in CEO Pay

These institutional changes were accompanied by significant growth in CEO pay, both
relative to the level at the beginning of the 2000s and relative to the level of pay for
clinical staff and middle managers. This is shown in Figure 1, which plots the level of
CEO pay over our sample period of 2000 to 2013, together with the mean pay of nurses,
consultants (senior physicians) and middle managers. Over this period CEO pay was,
not surprisingly, higher than pay of other NHS employees, but also increased faster. The
increase in pay was larger at the top than at the bottom of the CEO pay distribution, with
the difference between the 10th and the 90th percentile (the shaded areas in the Figure)
increasing from £40,000 in 2000 to £65,000 in 2013. At the top of the distribution CEO
pay increased from £120,000 in 2000 to £175,000 in 2013.16
This growth in pay did not compensate for differences in pay relative to CEOs in the
UK corporate sector and hospital executives in the US.17 However, these trends put the
15

The remuneration committee is composed of at least three independent non-executive directors. It
decides on pay of all executive directors and is to position its NHS FT relative to other NHS FTs
and comparable organizations (Monitor 2014). Boards of non-FTs were more constrained in their decisions on pay of both executive and non-executive directors and had to follow regulator guidance. For
CEOs see https://improvement.nhs.uk/resources/supporting-providers-executive-hr-issues/
and for Chairs and non-executive directors see https://improvement.nhs.uk/resources/terms-andconditions-nhs-trust-chairs-and-non-executive-directors. Executive and non-executive directors of FT hospitals are more highly paid than directors of non-FT hospitals.
16
NHS CEOs also receive generous pension benefits which are excluded from this analysis.
17
Bell & Van Reenen (2016) report mean total compensation of CEOs of the top 300 UK primary-listed
companies increased from £900,000 in 1999 to £1,900,000 in 2014. These remuneration packages are larger
by an order of magnitude. Joynt et al. (2014) report that mean compensation of CEOs of US non-profit

remuneration packages of NHS CEOs at the high end of the compensation distribution
of the UK public sector and of UK public service providers more generally.18 To show
this we examine pay data from the Quarterly Labour Force Survey, the largest household
study in the UK, from April 2000 to March 2017.19 The survey includes respondents’
gross weekly pay and industry classification (SIC), occupation classification and whether
they work in the public or private sector. We focus on respondents whose occupation
classification is “Directors and Chief Executives of Major Organisations”.20
Figure 2 presents pay split by industry and public and private sector. As the industry
classification was changed substantially in 2009, we present separate graphs for 2000-2008
hospitals was $596,000 (approximately £400,000) in 2009. The majority of CEOs in their sample served
at hospitals with fewer than 300 beds, well below even the 25th percentile of 446 in our sample. Similarly,
figures Joynt et al. (2014) report for the highest decile of the compensation distribution, which has the
largest mean number of beds (310), show mean compensation of $2,100,000 (approximately £1,400,000).
18
The Prime Minister’s salary is around £145,000. The higher pay of NHS CEOs has traditionally
attracted considerable negative attention from the popular media. Articles about “NHS fat cats” receiving
“six-figure salaries” or “earning more than the Prime Minister” are common (Ham et al. 2011).
19
The QLS provides the official measures of employment and unemployment.
20
We convert weekly gross pay to annual gross pay and adjust for inflation using the consumer price
index (base year = 2000). To deal with outliers and limited cell sizes for some industry-sector combinations, we windsorize the pay data at the 5% level, with the top 5% of data replaced with the 95th
percentile and the bottom 5% replaced with the 5th percentile.

and 2009-2017.21 In both periods NHS hospital CEOs and non-CEO directors were well
paid relative to top managers at a wide range of organizations in both the public and
private sector. On average NHS CEOs received the largest pay packages. Further, comparison between the upper and the lower graphs suggests the gap between the pay of NHS
directors and that of directors in other organizations grew rather than diminished over
the period.22 Thus, while perhaps NHS hospitals were unable to provide pay comparable
to that offered in similar large and complex private sector companies, over the time period
we consider NHS CEOs were among the most highly rewarded of similar executives in
public sector organizations.
In sum, the reform program resulted in a significant shift in the role of hospital CEOs
and in the way in which they were selected and remunerated. These changes were predicated on the belief that individual top managers–when adequately selected, compensated
and monitored–could deliver improvements in efficiency and quality. We investigate the
extent to which this belief is supported by evidence in the rest of the paper.

Data

Our analysis is based on information derived from various administrative data sources,
which we have brought together for the first time. In this section, we introduce the main
data sets used in the analysis and present summary statistics on the hospitals and CEOs
included in the sample as well as basic information on the movement of CEOs across
hospitals, which we rely on to separately identify hospital and CEO fixed effects.

3.1

Main Data Sources

Hospital-Level Variables Our starting point is a rich set of production measures at
the hospital level for the financial years 2000/01 to 2013/14.23 The NHS made these data
publicly available as part of the reforms described in Section 2. Thanks to this policy of
transparency, we were able to access a wide range of data on hospital production, including
measures of inputs, throughputs (e.g. access to care metrics such as waiting times, which
are important in a system where care is rationed), outputs (financial performance and
measures of the quality of clinical care) and staff job satisfaction. Variable definitions and
21

Details of the industries in Figure 2 and changes in the classification are in Web Appendix.
These comparisons do not take into account pension entitlements which are also more generous in
the NHS than in other public and private sector organizations.
23
Technically, these data are available at NHS hospital trust level. For readability we refer to NHS
hospital trusts as hospitals. The financial year runs from 1 April to 31 March.
22

10

details of the sources are in Appendix A.
CEO-level Variables We combine the hospital-level data with information on CEO
pay from the NHS Boardroom Pay Reports published by IDS Incomes Data Services for
2000/01 to 2010/11, which we extended by hand-collecting data from hospitals’ annual
reports for 2011/12 to 2013/14. These reports provide data on salary, taxable benefits
and total remuneration of executive directors for nearly all NHS hospitals.
The core executive director positions present on all hospital boards are CEO, Medical
Director, Nursing Director, Finance Director and HR Director.24 In the later years of
our panel we also regularly observe a Chief Operating Officer. Additionally, there is a
range of other positions such as Director of Facilities and Estate Development or Director of Information Management and Technology, which we categorize as “Other”.25 To
supplement the CEO pay data, we hand-collected data on the CEO characteristics of gender, educational achievements, clinical background, private sector experience and public
honours.26
Summary Statistics Table 1 presents descriptive statistics for the hospital production
measures and executive director pay. For each variable, we show the overall mean and
standard deviation as well as the mean at the beginning, in the middle and at the end
of our sample period. The number of observations for the hospital production measures
is determined by their availability and reflects the observations used in the estimations
reported below.
On average, the hospitals included in the sample have 75,000 admissions per year,
and these figures have steadily grown due to the consolidation experienced in the sector (see Figure 3b below). Our input measures reflect this consolidation. The ratio of
the most skilled staff to number of beds–a measure of the labour-to-capital ratio–and
the ratio of senior doctors to staff–a measure of the labour skills ratio–grew by around
70% over our sample period. The summary statistics show broad improvements in some
throughput measure. For example, waiting times–the time between decision to admit
and actual admission–declined from 93.5 days in 2000 to 48.9 days in 2013 and length
of stay declined from 7.29 days to 4.33 days over the same time period. There were also
improvements in clinical outcomes, such as acute myocardial infarction (AMI) mortality
24

The CEO of an NHS hospital is known as the Chief Executive, but the role is that of a CEO.
To ensure comparability, we drop from the pay data all observations that refer only to part of the
financial year (for example, because an executive director left the hospital at some point during the year).
26
The British honours system recognizes people who have made achievements in public life. Titles
bestowed on hospital CEOs include Knight, Dame, Commander/Officer/Member of the Order of the
British Empire (CBE/OBE/MBE).

Foundation Trust is a dummy variable that takes the value 1 once a hospital has achieved Foundation Trust status. Year of merger takes the value 1 in the year a hospital newly created through
a merger enters the sample and 0 otherwise. Years since merger takes the value 1 in the year after
a hospital newly created through a merger enters the sample, the value 2 in the following year and
so on. Acquisition takes the value 1 once a hospital has been involved in a merger that is more
like an acquisition, i.e. following the merger the hospital keeps its provider code while the provider
code of the other hospital disappears from any records. Definitions and sources of all variables in

rates declining from 9.18% in 2000 to 5.44% in 2012 and meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) rates declining from 15.7% in 2001 to 2.4% in 2013. For other
clinical outcomes, however, the data show more stagnant results. Deaths after admission
for fractured proximal femur (FPF) did not reduce much and readmissions increased. In
line with the earlier literature, there is also evidence of large variations in performance
across hospitals, for inputs, throughputs and outcomes.27 Financial performance nose
dived over our sample period, moving from an average surplus of £259,000 in 2000 to
an average deficit of £4,975,000 in 2013. Average CEO pay (adjusted for inflation) went
from £99,000 in 2000 to 138,000 in 2013. Average pay of executive directors other than
the CEO also increased but less steeply.
Table 2 provides descriptive statistics on time-varying hospital characteristics that we
use as controls in the hospital production function. They include governance measures,
capital measures and case-mix measures. Again, we show the overall mean and standard
deviation, as well as the mean at the beginning, in the middle and at the end of our
sample period. The proportion of hospitals who achieved Foundation Trust status steadily
increased over our sample period, reaching 62% in 2013. Merger activity fluctuated over
our sample period. On average each year 1.8% of hospitals in our sample were just created
through a merger. The number of beds initially increased with hospital consolidation, but
then decreased as efficiency improvements in care delivery were achieved (as indicated by
the decline in length of stay and the increase in the day case rate). Case-mix became
more challenging over our sample period, with the proportion of older patients steadily
increasing.
Table 3 summarizes the main characteristics of the 469 CEOs in our sample. About a
third are women, many of whom emerged from nursing careers. About a quarter have a
clinical background, the majority being nurses or allied health professionals rather than
doctors. About a quarter hold a postgraduate management qualification.28 10% have
prior experience in the private sector, sometimes between stints as CEOs in the NHS.
Industries range from health care and pharmaceuticals to manufacturing, retail, transport,
communications and management consultancy. About 13% of the total sample received
a public honour at some point in their career. In terms of tenure as CEO, we observe the
vast majority of the sample for more than one year, though their tenure is typically short
(only 17% are observed for more than 10 years as CEO). The median number of years a
CEO is observed in a particular CEO job is 3 years and the mean is 3.7 years.29
27

Chandra et al. (2016) show large and persistent performance differentials across U.S. hospitals.
These qualifications include straightforward MBAs but many CEOs hold qualifications such as an
MSc in Healthcare Management or a Diploma in Health Services Management.
29
The number of years a CEO is recorded in a CEO job is sometimes slightly less than the actual job

Identifying Movements of CEOs across Hospitals

The CEO pay data provide information on where each Chief Executive worked and when,
which we use to identify CEO turnover events and movements of CEOs across hospitals.30
The NHS hospital sector is characterized by very high CEO turnover rates. Figure 3a
shows that every year between 12 to 25% of hospitals in our sample have a turnover
event.31 The high turnover rates are partly due to hospital consolidation. Figure 3b
shows the decrease in the number of hospitals on which the turnover rates in Figure
3a are based. From the late 1990s to the early 2000s, the NHS experienced a wave of
consolidation activity. Over half the stock of NHS acute hospitals in 1997 had been
involved in some kind of merger or reconfiguration with other NHS hospitals by the end
duration. If the CEO served for only part of a financial year we do not know the number of months they
served in that year.
30
To identify moves of CEOs across hospitals, we manually checked the personal identifiers for all
executive directors in the data.
31
As our data start in 2000 we report turnover events only from 2001 onward. Some hospitals experienced more than one CEO turnover event in a financial year.

15

Figure 3: CEO turnover and hospital consolidation

(a) Annual proportion of hospitals with CEO
turnover event

(b) Annual number of hospitals

of 2003 (Gaynor et al. 2012).32
Figure 4a shows sample entry and exit of hospitals between 2000 and 2013. At the
beginning of our sample period in 2000 and 2001 over 10% of hospitals exit the sample.
Hospitals only enter the sample because of mergers: following a merger, the merged entity
was generally given a new NHS code. We treat each new code as a separate hospital in
our analysis.33 Figure 4b shows sample entry and exit of CEOs over the same period.
Hospital consolidations mechanically led to increased CEO turnover, since at the very
least only one of the CEOs of the formerly separate hospitals continued in post, and
frequently a new CEO was appointed to lead the consolidated hospital. However, CEO
turnover appears to have increased even in absence of merger events. CEO sample entry
and exit is on average considerably higher than hospital sample entry and exit, at around
14% for the whole period. CEO entry and exits in our sample are highest during the
period of consolidation in the early 2000s and then fall and remain relatively stable after
2004, but are still both over 10% at the end of the period.34
Figure 5a shows CEO turnover per hospital for the subset of hospitals observed for
at least 11 years.35 These hospitals have on average 3.5 CEOs during the sample period.
Only a minority of hospitals have the same CEO throughout and the majority have two
to five CEOs over the sample period of 11 to 14 years. Hospitals with more CEOs over the

All consolidation was within the NHS. Consolidation meant that NHS hospitals grew in size, providing
services from a number of sites in the same local area. There are no NHS hospital chains.
33
Mergers in which a much larger hospital absorbed a smaller hospital and kept its name and NHS
code are captured by the acquisition dummy variable.
34
The rise in exits in 2012 reflects the uptick in hospital consolidation in 2011.
35
As our data set excludes CEOs that served for a part year only, the number of CEOs per hospital is
a lower bound.

sample period tend to be in certain broad regions of England but few other time-invariant
characteristics are associated with the number of CEOs a hospital has over our sample
period.36 Figure 5b shows that a sizeable number of CEOs are observed as CEOs in 2 or
more NHS hospitals, reflecting the numbers in Table 3.
To examine whether mover CEOs are different, we regress fixed characteristics of the
CEO against a dummy variable indicating whether a CEO is one of the 95 CEOs in our
fixed effects estimation sample (which requires they are a mover and that they are in each
hospital for at least two years). The characteristics we examined were gender, whether
the CEO has a clinical qualification and whether they have a postgraduate management
qualification. Mover CEOs are slightly more likely to have a postgraduate management
qualification but do not differ in terms of gender or clinical background from the rest of
the CEOs in our sample.37 Tenure for these CEOs is short, the median being 4 years and
the mean being 4.5 years.38

Methods

CEO Fixed Effects in Pay

We follow Abowd et al. (1999) to estimate CEO fixed effects in pay. We use pay data for
all executive directors (i.e. including COOs, Finance Directors, HR Directors, Nursing
36

Details are in Table W-1 in the Web Appendix.
For details see Table W-2 in the Web Appendix.
38
For these 95 CEOs, real pay rises after a move by just over 18 percent. 60 percent of CEO moves
are across different large geographical areas (NHS regions).

(b) Hospital spells per CEO (N = 469)

(a) CEOs per hospital (N = 162)

Notes: CEOs per hospital is the number of CEOs observed per hospital for hospitals observed
for at least 11 years. Hospital spells per CEO is the number of CEO spells at different hospitals
for executive directors that are observed in a CEO position at least once.

Directors and other directors but excluding Medical Directors as only some of their remuneration is recorded in the executive pay data).39 As discussed by Abowd et al. (1999),
between hospital mobility of the executive directors is essential for the identification of
the hospital effects. Including all executive directors, and not just CEOs, increases the
size of the set of hospitals connected by worker mobility, and also produces more reliable
estimates of the hospital effects.
Including all executive directors requires adding controls for the different director
positions, since different positions receive markedly different pay packages. Identifying
the coefficients on the director position controls, however, is very challenging because, in
a regression with hospital fixed effects and executive director fixed effects, the coefficients
on the director position controls are identified only by the handful of executive directors
changing director position. We therefore employ a two-step estimation procedure in which
we first regress executive directors’ pay on a set of dummy variables indicating their board
level position:
payit = δ1 + δ2 COOit + δ3 f inance_directorit + δ4 HR_directorit

(1)

+ δ5 nursing_directorit + δ6 other_directorit + εit
where payit denotes pay of executive director i in financial year t. COOit is an indicator

of Medical Director remuneration is for clinical work, which is excluded from the directors’ data.

variable that takes the value one if the job title of executive director i during financial year
t was Chief Operating Officer and zero otherwise. Similarly, the other variables indicate
a board position as Finance Director, HR Director, Nursing Director and Other type of
executive director, respectively. CEO is the omitted category. We estimate this regression
using the same observations that we include in the second step.40 We extract the residuals
to use as the outcome variable in Equation 2.
In the second step we estimate the wage equation for the largest subset of hospitals
that are connected by executive directors moving between them:
pay_residualit = X 0j(i,t)t β + γ tenureij(i,t)t + λt + αi + ψj(i,t) + εit

(2)

The left-hand side variable, pay_residualit , is the residual from Equation 1, i.e. the
pay of executive director i in period t net of the impact of their board level position.
The function j(i, t) maps executive director i to hospital j in financial year t. X jt is
a vector of time-varying observable hospital characteristics that includes merger status,
number of beds, a technology index and case mix measures (more details are in Appendix
A). tenureij(i,t)t is the tenure of executive director i at hospital j(i, t) in financial year
t. A full set of financial year effects, λt , provides non-parametric control for trends in
pay that are national in scope while a full set of hospital effects, ψj(i,t) , controls for nontime varying unobserved differences between hospitals. The estimates of interest are the
executive director effects αi , which capture non-time varying unobserved characteristics
that affect directors’ pay. εit represents the error term.
For observations not connected by worker mobility it is not possible to identify separate
executive director effects αi and hospital effects ψj(i,t) (Abowd et al. 1999). In our sample
this is not an issue as there are only 162 pay observations in 17 hospitals that are not
connected by worker mobility. The connected set, on the other hand, has 478 movers that
connect 196 hospitals.
We calculate the proportion of the variance in the pay variable, pay_residualit , that
is explained by the covariates, X j(i,t)t , tenureij(i,t)t and λt , the hospital effects, ψj(i,t) ,
and the executive director effects, αi , respectively. For the hospital effects this proportion is simply [Cov(pay_residualit , ψ̂j(i,t) )/Var(pay_residualit )] × 100. For the executive director effects it is [Cov(pay_residualit , α̂i )/Var(pay_residualit )] × 100. To
obtain the proportion explained by the covariates, we first calculate the pay residual
\ it = X 0j(i,t)t β̂ +
predicted by the coefficient estimates for the covariates, pay_residual
γ̂ tenureij(i,t)t + λ̂t . In the next step we use this prediction to calculate the covariance:

In the second step we only include observations for which we can separately identify executive director
and hospital effects.

CEO Fixed Effects in Hospital Production

Our approach exploits movement of the same CEO across different hospitals–the fixed
effects approach pioneered by Bertrand & Schoar (2003). We adapt this approach to
take advantage of our many measures of hospital production, which we group into sets
reflecting inputs, throughputs and clinical performance. We begin by outlining the basic
Bertrand & Schoar (2003) approach and then discuss how we take advantage of our many
production measures in a “stacked” version.
Basic version The fixed effects approach proposed by Bertrand & Schoar (2003) involves estimating regressions of the following form:
yjt = X 0jt β + λt + ψj + αi(j,t) + εjt

(3)

The left-hand side variable, yjt , is a production measure of hospital j in financial year
t. The function i(j, t) maps hospital j to CEO i in financial year t. X j(i,t)t is the same
set of time varying hospitals variables included in Equation 2. We also include a full
set of financial year effects, λt , which non-parametrically controls for trends in hospital
performance that are national in scope while a full set of hospital effects, ψj , controls for
non-time varying unobserved differences between hospitals. The estimates of interest are
the CEO effects αi(j,t) . εjt represents the error term.
The estimated CEO effects are essentially the mean of the residuals of a regression of yjt
on X jt , λt and ψj over the observations of the hospitals the CEO has been observed in, for
the financial years the CEO has been observed there. Following Bertrand & Schoar (2003),
we estimate CEO effects αi(j,t) only for the subset of CEOs observed in two hospitals for
at least two years each.41 As Bertrand & Schoar (2003) discuss, the estimated CEO effect
for a CEO observed in only one hospital for only part of the time for which that hospital
is observed would be identified but would be a period-hospital-specific effect rather than
a CEO effect.42 We follow Bertrand & Schoar (2003) and present F-statistics from tests
41

This sampling requirement means effects that matter require that corporate practices be correlated
across two hospitals when the same CEO is present and gives CEOs time to "make their mark" (Bertrand
& Schoar 2003). For CEOs observed in three or four hospitals for at least two years in each, we use only
the two most recent spells to be comparable with the other CEOs.
42
There are two further issues when determining the CEOs for whom we estimate CEO effects. One,
some CEOs are observed in a hospital for two years but they served for only part of each of these two
years. We define these observations as not complying with our requirement of being observed for at least
two years. Two, the CEO effect for a CEO observed in one hospital for the exact same time period we

20

of the joint significance of the estimated CEO effects to assess the statistical significance
of these estimates.
To enable comparison of the CEO effects in hospital production with those in pay, we
present the equivalent to the variance proportions described in Section 4.1. We calculate
the proportion of the variance in the hospital production measures, yjt , that is explained
by the covariates, X 0jt β and λt , the hospital effects, ψj , and the CEO effects, αi(j,t) .
The proportion of the variance explained by the hospital effects and the CEO effects are
[Cov(yjt , ψ̂j )/Var(yjt )] × 100 and [Cov(yjt , α̂i(j,t) )/Var(yjt )] × 100, respectively. To obtain
the proportion explained by the covariates, we calculate ŷjt = X 0j(i,t)t β̂ + γ̂ + λ̂t and use
this prediction to calculate the covariance: [Cov(yjt , ŷjt )/Var(yjt )] × 100.
Stacked Version To take advantage of our large number of hospital production measures , we implement stacked versions of Equation 3 and estimate a common CEO effect αi(j,t) for sets of variables. We stack our four input measures, our five throughput
measures, and our five clinical performance measures and estimate a single αi(j,t) for each
set.43 We also examine two production measures–staff satisfaction and surplus–separately
as these measures are not standard input, throughput or clinical performance measures.
The stacked regressions take the following form:
ks
yjt
=

Ks
X

zks [X 0jt β + λt + ψj ] + αi(j,t) + εkjts

(4)

ks =1
ks
The left-hand side variable, yjt
, is one of the Ks outcome variables in set s. All Ks
outcome variables in set s are stacked, so the sample size is approximately Ks times the
number of hospital-year observations jt. Each outcome variable is standardised to have
mean zero and a standard deviation of one. Furthermore, variables such as waiting times
and stroke deaths are multiplied by (−1), so an increase in an outcome variable can be
interpreted as an improvement. The additional (compared to Equation 3) variable zks is
ks
a dummy variable that takes the value one if the left-hand side variable yjt
is outcome
variable ks . For each of the Ks outcome variables in set s, we estimate separate coefficients
on the time-varying observable hospital characteristics X jt , a separate set of financial year
effects λt and a separate set of hospital effects ψj by interacting the hospital characteristics,
financial year effects and hospital effects with the dummy variables zk . Only the estimates
for the CEO effects αi(j,t) are common to all ks outcome variables in set s. We estimate

observe the hospital for would be perfectly collinear with the hospital effect ψj . Therefore we ignore such
observations when determining which CEO observations meet our estimation requirements.
43
Table 1 presents descriptive statistics for the components of the stacked sets.

21

standard errors that are clustered at hospital level.
The stacked version of the Bertrand & Schoar (2003) method realizes the full potential
of our data. Firstly, it tackles the issue of missing observations for some of the hospital
production measures.44 When estimating Equation 3, for each yjt we have to use only
those CEO observations which are observed at two hospitals for at least two years. The
stacked approach in Equation 4 allows us to relax this requirement. We require CEOs to
have at least two observations for at least two of the outcome variables in set s at two
different hospitals. This relaxed requirement increases the number of CEOs for whom we
can estimate a CEO effect αi(j,t) . Secondly, the stacked approach increases the sample
size and therefore gives us more statistical power to detect CEO effects. Thirdly, it allows
for correlations between the outcome variables in a set and reduces potential multiple
comparison issues. Finally, it simplifies the exposition of the results. For completeness,
we report results from analyses examining each hospital production measure separately
in the Web Appendix. Reassuringly, these results are consistent with the results for the
stacked production measures.
Placebo Experiments Using Random Assignments of CEOs A possible shortcoming of the Bertrand & Schoar (2003) approach, in the basic and stacked versions,
is that a large residual in one hospital might result in a large mean residual and therefore a CEO effect estimate α̂i(j,t) that is statistically significantly different from zero as a
consequence of a period-hospital-specific effect rather than as a consequence of a persistent CEO effect. We therefore assess the validity of F-tests on CEO effects by randomly
assigning CEOs to both their first and second hospital and re-estimating.
Our starting point for the random assignment are those CEO spells used in Equation
4. For example, a CEO might be observed at Hospital A from 2001/02-2004/05 and at
Hospital B from 2005/06-2008/09. We randomly assign this CEO to a hospital for the
period 2001/02-and to another hospital for 2005/06-2008/09. The set of hospitals used
in the random assignment is the same set as that used in the non-random assignment
estimates. To ensure that each hospital is assigned to only one CEO at a time, we sample
hospitals without replacement and remove a hospital that has been assigned to a CEO
spell from the pool for the duration of the CEO spell it has been assigned to. We then
estimate Equation 4 for the sample with the random CEO-hospital matches i(j, t), test
the joint significance of the CEO effects using an F-test, count the number of CEO effects
that are individually statistically significant, and calculate the proportion of the variance
44
Observations are missing because certain production measures are not relevant for the particular
hospital. For example, some specialist hospitals have no admissions for acute myocardial infarction
(AMI), so we have no observations on AMI deaths for these hospitals.

22

of the left-hand side variable yit that is explained by the CEO effects. We repeat this
process 100 times and compare the means over the 100 replications to the values obtained
using the actual CEO-hospital matches i(j, t).
Two-step Procedure Bertrand & Schoar (2003) propose an alternative two-step procedure for assessing the impact of individual CEOs on firm behaviour. Again, for ease of
exposition, we begin by describing this procedure for the non-stacked case. In the first
step, each measure of production, yjt , is regressed on the vector of time-varying observable
hospital characteristics X jt , the financial year effects λt and the hospital effects ψj :
yjt = X 0jt β + λt + ψj + εjt

(5)

For each CEO observed in two hospitals for at least two years duration in each, two
residual means are calculated from Equation 5. These are the mean of the residuals for
i,A
the financial years ti,A
1 to tn when CEO i is observed in hospital A and the mean of the
residuals for the financial years ti,B
to ti,B
1
n when CEO i is observed in hospital B. In the
second step, the mean for CEO i’s spell in hospital B is regressed on the mean for CEO
i’s spell in hospital A:

The coefficient of interest is δ2 . A positive value indicates that individual CEOs’
deviations from the expected level of the dependent variable yjt are similar across two
different hospitals, which would be supportive of a persistent CEO effect.
To implement the stacked approach in the two-step procedure, we estimate the stacked
equivalent of Equation (5):
ks
yjt

Ks

zks [X 0jt β + λt + ψj ] + εkjts

(7)

ks =1
ks
As in Equation 4, each outcome variable yjt
is standardised to have mean zero and
a standard deviation of one and variables such as waiting times and stroke deaths are
multiplied by (-1). We extract the residuals ekjts and for each hospital-year observation jt
P s ks 45
generate the mean residual across all ks outcome variables in set s: esjt = K1s K
ks =1 ejt .
45

In the case of a missing observation for one or two of the Ks outcome variables, the mean residual
could be a mean over Ks − 1 or Ks − 2 outcome variables.

23

For each CEO with at least two observations for at least two of the outcome variables in
set s in both hospitals, we generate the mean of the mean residuals esjt for each of the
CEO’s spells and regress them on each other as in (6):

We check the validity of the two-step procedure by extending the above-described
placebo experiment using random assignment of CEOs to Equations 7 and 8.
Pre-assignment Trends As a robustness test, we run a placebo regression proposed
by Bertrand & Schoar (2003). Instead of using the mean of the mean residuals at hospital

B during the time the CEO was observed there, ni,B
esBt , we use the mean of the
t=ti,B
1
mean residuals, esjt , at hospital B during the three financial years before the CEO arrived
at hospital B. The idea is that a positive δ2 in Equation 8 might wrongly suggest that
individual CEOs have an impact on hospital production. Instead, hospital boards might
recruit CEOs that have experience of an environment similar to the one the hospital is
currently operating in. For example, a CEO who has overseen a shift to more day case
procedures at hospital A might be recruited to oversee a similar shift to more day case
procedures at hospital B. In this case, deviations from the expected proportion of day
case procedures at hospital B might precede the new CEO’s arrival. A positive association
between CEO i’s deviations from the expected proportion of day cases at hospital A and
hospital B’s deviation from the expected proportion during the three years before CEO i
arrived there is suggestive of selection of the CEO rather than of the CEO imposing their
style. On the other hand, if hospital B’s deviations from the expected proportion during
the three years before CEO i arrived are completely unrelated to the deviations during
CEO i’s spell at hospital B, we can have more confidence that a positive estimate of δ2
from Equation 8 indicates the impact of the CEO on hospital performance.
Non Parametric Approach The fixed effects approach relies heavily on our statistical
model of hospital production, since both Equation 4 and Equation 7 use the residuals from
this statistical model to estimate the impact of individual CEOs. Both equations also
rely on CEOs having an impact on the same dimension of hospital production across two
hospitals. We use a non-parametric approach to sidestep both problems. Our approach
resembles a difference-in-difference estimator combined with matching. We compare the
changes in hospital production following a CEO turnover event to changes in hospital
24

production at matched hospitals without a CEO turnover event. If there is any impact
of CEOs on hospital production, we expect to see different changes after a CEO turnover
event compared to changes at otherwise similar hospitals with no CEO turnover event.
We describe the non parametric approach and associated results in detail in Appendix B.

Results

5.1

CEO Effects in Pay

Table 4 reports the results from estimating Equation 2 and shows the proportions of the
variance in the pay variables that are explained by the covariates, the hospital effects, the
director effects and the residuals, respectively.46 We estimate Equation 2 only for the pay
observations in the largest connected set, which comprises of 478 movers that connect 196
hospitals (the vast majority of the sample). Table 4 shows that in the connected set the
director effects are jointly statistically significant. The hospital effects, executive director
effects and covariates jointly explain more than 85% of the variation in executive director
pay, with each accounting for around 30% of the variation.
Table 4 also presents results for the subset of directors observed in a CEO position at
least once (397 of the 2,111 executive directors in the connected set) and for the further
subset of CEOs that are included in the parametric analyses of CEO impacts on hospital
production (95 of the 397 CEOs). The director effects are jointly statistically significant
in both subsets and the variance decompositions are similar across all three sets.
The interquartile range in hospital (firm) effects is around £16,000. In the Web Appendix we present correlates of this variation. We find that hospital effects in pay are
higher in teaching hospitals and lower in specialist hospitals. There is also considerable
regional variation, reflecting regional differences in the cost of living.
Figure 6a shows the distribution of the pay effects for all directors in the connected set,
the 397 who were ever CEOs and the subset of 95 CEOs. Since the α̂i are estimated relative
to an arbitrary omitted director, we have transformed the estimates into deviations from
the mean of all α̂i . The distribution for the 95 CEOs included in the hospital production
analyses lies slightly to the right of the distribution for all CEOs. The interquartile range
is around £18,000 for the full sample of director effects and for the subsample of directors
ever observed as CEO. For the 95 CEOs used in the hospital production analyses the
range is slightly smaller at £15,000.47
46

We report only the results for total pay as the results for basic pay are very similar.
By position, the interquartile range is smallest for Nursing Directors at £15,000, followed by HR
Directors at £16,000. For Finance Directors and COOs the range is around £17,000. For directors that

The dependent variable is the residual from a regression of total pay (CPI adjusted) on job title dummies. Variance proportion is the proportion of variance
in the pay variable that is explained by the covariates, the hospital effects, the director effects and the residuals, respectively. Covariates are financial year
effects, foundation trust status, year of merger, years since merger, beds, technology index, case mix variables and tenure.

(a) Estimates

(b) Shrunk estimates

Notes: Kernel density plots of deviations of estimated director effects in total pay, CPI
adjusted, from mean. Shrunk estimates obtained using empirical Bayes shrinkage estimator.

Due to sampling error the distribution of the estimates of the director effects in pay will
overstate the true distribution of the effects. We therefore adjust the effect estimates using
an empirical Bayes procedure and shrink the effect estimates towards the overall mean.48
Figure 6b presents the distribution of the shrunk effect estimates. As for the unadjusted
estimates, the distribution for the 95 CEOs included in the hospital production analyses
lies slighty to the right of the distribution for all CEOs. As expected, the distribution
is much narrower. At around £9,000 the interquartile range is approximately halved
compared to the unadjusted estimates.
In Table 5 we examine which personal and sample-specific characteristics are associated
with the CEO pay effects (original estimates as well as shrunk estimates) and test whether
there are differences in these associations between all CEOs in our sample and the 95 CEOs
in the hospital production analyses. We report results from a series of regressions, each
examining one CEO characteristics.49 We find that female CEOs are paid statistically
significantly less, with the effect being even stronger for the subset of CEOs included in
the hospital production analyses. As being female and some of the other characteristics
such as clinical background are highly correlated, we include in all remaining regressions a
control for female and for the interaction of female and being in the 95 CEOs subset. WE
find CEOs who received a public honour and CEOs with a clinical background are paid
we categorize as “Other” the interquartile range is £19,500 and therefore exceeds the £18,000 range for
the directors that were ever observed as CEO.
48
We employ the empirical Bayes shrinkage estimator described in Chandra et al. (2016).
49
In the Web Appendix we present results from a regression that includes all CEO characteristics
simultaneously.

more (the effect being driven by doctors rather than nurses). CEOs with a postgraduate
management qualification are paid less. CEOs with leadership experience in the private
sector are paid less, but the association is positive for the 95 CEOs subset. CEO observed
in our sample for 10 years or longer are paid more, as are CEOs observed in 3 or more
CEO jobs. Importantly, there are few differences in the patterns of these associations
between the 95 CEOs included in the parametric analyses of CEO impacts on hospital
production and the CEOs not used in these analyses.
In sum, we find sizeable differences in pay across CEOs in the NHS, suggesting that
employers perceive CEOs to be differentiated and pay them accordingly. We now investigate whether there is also evidence of CEO differentiation in terms of hospital production.

5.2

Are there CEO Effects in Hospital Production?

Main Estimates We start by estimating Equation 4 using the sets of production measures. We first use actual CEO-hospital matches and then run the placebo experiment
using random matches. In Table 6 we present the stacked input, throughput and clinical
performance measures results.50 In Table 7 we present staff job satisfaction and financial
surplus results.
Results for the actual CEO-hospital matches are presented in the first row of each
panel. The R2 (Column 3) is high for all variables, suggesting that the hospital effects,
the CEO effects, the financial year effects and our measures of time-varying hospital
characteristics jointly explain a large proportion of the variation in these measures. The
F-tests (Column 1) suggest that the estimated CEO effects are jointly statistically significantly different from zero for all our hospital production measures, including staff job
satisfaction and surplus. The proportion of CEO effects that are individually significantly
different from zero (Column 2) varies from 24.2% for surplus to 47.1% for inputs.
Columns 5 to 8 present, for the subsample of hospital-year observations with at least
one CEO effect αi(j,t) (i.e. hospital-year observations when at least one of the 95 CEOs is
present), the proportion of the variance in the hospital production measures that is explained by each term in Equation 4: the covariates (time-varying hospital characteristics
+ year effects), the hospital effects, the CEO effects and the residuals. A considerable
proportion of the variance is accounted for by the observed covariates and the hospital
effects (with the exception of surplus). The CEO effects, despite being jointly statistically
significant as measured by the F-test, explain less than 6% of the variance in the performance measures. Again, surplus is the exception, as the variance proportion explained by
50
We repeat all analyses presented in this section for each of the variables in the sets separately. These
results corroborate the stacked results. See Tables W-5, W-6 and W-7 in the Web Appendix.

df = degrees of freedom. df1 is the number of CEO effects, df2 is the number of hospital clusters. All outcome variables in a stacked set are
standardised to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. Some outcome variables in the stacked sets are multiplied by (-1), so that
“more” means “better”. Standard errors used for the statistical significance tests are clustered at hospital level. Variance proportion is the proportion
of variance in the pay variable that is explained by the covariates, the hospital effects, the director effects and the residuals, respectively. Covariates
are financial year effects, foundation trust status, year of merger, years since merger, beds (except for input measures), technology index (except for
input measures) and case mix variables. The results for random CEO-hospital matches are means and standard deviations across 100 replications.

Results in Column 1 are from regressions of mean of residuals for CEO spell in second hospital on mean
of residuals for CEO spell in first hospital. Results in Column 2 are from regressions of mean of residuals
for CEO spell in second hospital on mean of residuals in second hospital during the three years before
CEO was appointed. The residuals are from a regression of the standardised stacked measures or the
standardised individual measures on hospital characteristics, financial year effects and hospital effects.
For the stacked measures, the residuals for the 4 or 5 outcome measures in each group are then averaged
by hospital-year before the mean of residuals for each CEO spell is being calculated. *Significant at 10%,
**significant at 5%, ***significant at 1%

Robustness While these results suggest the existence of statistically significant CEO
effects, a deeper look at the data suggests otherwise. First, from the random CEO-hospital
matches reported in the second and third row of each panel, it is clear the means of the Fstatistics across the 100 replications are as large as for the actual CEO-hospital matches.
The F-test rejects the null hypothesis of the randomly generated CEO effects jointly
being equal to zero for every one of the 100 replications, a rejection frequency of 100% at
a nominal significance level of 1%. Similarly, the mean of the proportion of CEO effects
that are individually statistically significantly different from zero is very similar to that
for the actual CEO-hospital matches. Finally, the mean variance proportion explained
32

by the CEO effects when CEOs are randomly assigned to hospitals is very similar to the
variance proportions explained by the CEO effects using the actual assignments. The
largest difference is for surplus, but even for this measure the ratio of variance explained
by the CEO effect to the residual is similar across actual and random matches. These
results suggest that the CEO effect estimates, and therefore the F-tests, may be capturing
period-hospital-specific shocks rather than true CEO effects.
Second, the results from the alternative two-step method of Equations 7 and 8 also
indicate issues in the estimated CEO fixed effects. These two-step results are presented in
Column 1 of Table 8.51 In these regressions a positive coefficient indicates that a positive
deviation from the expected level of a set of production measures during a CEO’s spell
at the first hospital is associated with a positive deviation from the expected level of that
set of production measure during the CEO’s spell at the second hospital. A statistically
significant association would suggest that these deviations can be attributed to the CEO
and not to period-hospital-specific effects. However, the coefficients are very small or
even negative, suggesting that there is no association between the residuals at the first
and second hospital. The only exception is for the set of throughput measures, which has
a coefficient of 0.20.52 For comparison, the last row of Table 8 presents results from a
regression that uses mean residuals from a regression of executive director pay on hospital
characteristics, tenure, financial year effects and hospital effects–essentially the regression
in Equation 2 without the executive director effects αi . In contrast with the production
measures, the statistically significant coefficient of 0.28 suggests that a CEO who was paid
more than expected in their first hospital is also paid more than expected in the second.
Third, examination of pre-assignment trends suggests that the positive correlation for
the throughput measures could be due to selection rather than CEOs imposing their style.
Column 2 of Table 8 presents associations between the mean of the residuals in the second
hospital where each CEO is assigned during the three years before the CEO arrived and
those after the CEO is appointed. For the throughput measures the coefficient in the test
for pre-assignment trends is 0.10, similar to the coefficient of 0.20 in Column 1. While, in
general, the coefficients in Column 2 are similar or larger than those in Column 1, none
are statistically significant, so indicating the absence of significant pre-assignment trends.
Overall, our analysis indicates that the statistical significance of the estimated CEO
fixed effects is driven by hospital-period-specific shocks rather than persistent CEO effects.
51

We repeat these analyses for each of the variables in the sets separately (Table W-8 in Web Appendix.)
We run the placebo experiment using random assignments of CEOs to check the validity of the twostep procedure (Table W-9 in Web Appendix). They show no impact of CEOs, as expected for random
matches, indicating the two-step procedure is valid.
52

33

Additional Results We use the spell-specific residual means to explore if there is any
indication of “management styles”. For example, we might observe that CEO spells with
positive deviations in one set of outcome measures also tend to have positive deviations in
another set of outcome measures. To investigate if any such patterns exist, we examined
the correlations between the spell-specific residual means across the different sets of production measures. Four of the ten correlation coefficients among the five sets of stacked
variables that we consider in the analysis are negative and six are positive but they are all
small and none are statistically significant.53 We also examined the correlations between
the shrunk CEO pay effects and the spell-specific residual means of the stacked production
measures derived from the two step procedure. Again, the five correlation coefficients are
small and none are statistically significant.54

Potential Reasons for Lack of Persistent CEO Effects

The results show significant and persistent differences in pay across CEOs but little evidence of persistent CEO effects in production. We explore three potential explanations
that might reconcile these two seemingly conflicting findings. First, we study whether
there is evidence of endogenous assignment. If “better” CEOs have a higher probability
of being hired by more problematic hospitals, it could make it harder for these CEOs to
replicate a positive impact across hospitals. Second, we examine the effects of CEO tenure
on hospital performance. This analysis is motivated by the observation that mover CEOs
tend to have short tenure on average, so the finding of no CEO impacts may reflect the
inability to affect hospital production in a short time frame. Finally, we consider whether
there is evidence of match effects. Match effects would imply that CEO impacts are
specific to the fit between CEO and hospital, rather than being portable across hospitals.

6.1

Endogenous Assignment

The lack of persistent CEO fixed effects we find might have been generated by endogenous assignment of CEOs to hospitals. A CEO who experiences a positive shock in one
hospital may subsequently be hired by a hospital at which it is difficult to bring about
positive changes. In this case, an above expected performance would be followed by a

The largest coefficients are: -0.17 for (inputs, surplus), -0.08 for (inputs, staff satisfaction), 0.09 for
(throughputs, staff satisfaction), and 0.08 for (inputs, clinical performance).
54
The correlation coefficients are: 0.03 for (inputs, CEO pay effect); 0.11 for (throughputs, CEO pay
effect); -0.004 for (clinical performance, CEO pay effect); 0.045 for (staff job satisfaction, CEO pay effect)
and -0.09 for (surplus, shrunk CEO pay effects).

below average performance, resulting in no apparent CEO fixed effect and a negative correlation between performance in the first hospital and performance in the second. Other
indications of this type of assignment would be if CEOs who have higher variability in
their performance are at some point in a hospital that is hard to manage, or if CEOs who
are well paid are assigned at some point to a hard-to-manage hospital.
To test these ideas, we begin by identifying hospitals which may be hard-to-manage
because they are experiencing problems. We consider four definitions of “problematic”.
These are (i) having received a poor rating from the government regulator of hospitals
before the CEO arrived at the hospital, (ii) having poor financial performance, defined
as being in the lowest 25th percentile of surplus in the year before the CEO arrived, (iii)
being a ‘new’ hospital that was created through a merger at some point during our sample
period, and (iv) holding a contract for a large capital investment (a PFI contract) at some
point during the CEO’s tenure.55
We first examine whether CEOs who were good performers at their first hospital are
subsequently hired by a problematic hospital. We define CEO performance using the
to ti,A
mean of the mean residuals esjt from Equation 7 for the financial years ti,A
1
n when
CEO i is observed in hospital A. We classify as good performers those CEOs whose mean
of the mean residuals is at or above the 75th percentile. We estimate linear probability
models of the impact of good performance in the first hospital on moving to a probleamatic
hospital. Table 9 presents the results.56 There are 4 definitions of problematic and 4 sets of
performance measures, generating 16 coefficient estimates. Only one of the estimates (the
association between higher than expected throughputs in the first hospital and moving
to a hospital created through a merger) is statistically significant and then it is negative,
indicating that good performers are less likely to subsequently be hired by a hospital that
has experienced a merger event.
Second, we examine whether variability in CEO performance is associated with being at some point matched with a problematic hospital. We generate a measure of the
variability in CEO performance as follows. We use the mean of the mean residuals from
i,A
Equation 7 for the financial years ti,A
1 to tn when CEO i is observed in hospital A and the
mean of the mean residuals for the financial years ti,B
to ti,B
1
n when CEO i is observed in
hospital B. To measure variability in CEO performance, we calculate the absolute value
55

NHS hospitals have to borrow for large capital investments from the private market. Borrowing is
through vehicles with long-term fixed interest rates and long payback periods, known as private finance
initiative (PFI) contracts. Hospitals with these contracts have often struggled to meet financial performance requirements once the payback period has begun. Regulator ratings were not issued each year.

of the difference in these two means. We generate this variability measure for all sets of
production measures and examine whether the variability measure is larger for CEOs who
at some point in their career work in problematic hospitals. To do this, for each of the
four definitions of “problematic”, we regress each of the 5 variability measures against a
dummy variable indicating that the CEO was ever observed in a problematic hospital.
Table 10 presents the results. 5 out of the 20 coefficients are statistically significantly
different from zero at the 10% significance level. However, only one of these (for the set
of throughput measures) is positive, where a positive coefficient would suggest that being
at a “problematic” hospital is associated with higher variability in CEO performance. For
the other four statistically significant coefficients the estimated association is negative,
suggesting that CEOs who are at some point at a more problematic hospital actually
have lower variability in their performance across hospitals.

Each column refers to a separate regression of an indicator of a CEO ever being observed at a “problematic”
hospital on an indicator of a large positive CEO fixed effect in total pay. “Problematic” hospital is defined
as either poor hospital commission rating, surplus below 25th percentile, hospital created through merger
or hospital with PFI contract. The 25th percentile of surplus is calculated separately for each financial
year to ensure the categorisation is net of year effects. The CEO fixed effects in total pay are the estimated
executive director effects from the total pay regression in Table 4, transformed into deviations from the
mean of all estimated executive director effects and extracted for the subset of CEOs included in the
analyses of CEO fixed effects in hospital production. Standard errors in (parentheses). *Significant at
10%, **significant at 5%, ***significant at 1%

Third, we examine whether CEOs who have a large positive pay effect–and are therefore viewed by the market as good performers–were ever hired at a problematic hospital.
Table 11 presents the results. The first column shows that CEOs with large positive pay
effects are less likely to be hired at hospitals rated as low quality, though the estimate is
not statistically significantly different from zero. The second column of the table presents
38

the association of the CEO pay effect and the financial performance of the hospitals they
join. CEOs with large positive pay effects are significantly less likely to work at hospitals with low surplus. The third column examines whether more highly paid CEOs are
ever hired at a hospital created through a merger. The estimate indicates that this is
not the case. The fourth column examines whether any of the hospitals in which highly
paid CEOs are observed had PFI contracts. The estimate is positive but not statistically
significant.
We conclude that there is little evidence that CEOs viewed by the market as good
performers are more likely to be hired by problematic hospitals. If anything, CEOs with
large positive pay effects are less likely to be hired by such hospitals during their careers.

6.2

Short Tenure

Another reason for the lack of persistent impact of the CEOs may be that their tenure is
too short for their effect on hospital production to materialize consistently across hospitals
(the average period for which a CEO is in post in our full sample is only around 3.5
years). To examine this possibility, we look at the association between tenure and CEO
production. To do this we use the residuals from Equation 7, i.e. hospital-year deviations
from the expected level of our different hospital production measures.
Since tenure is measured separately for each CEO spell, for this analysis we can examine all CEOs in our data set (i.e. we can include CEOs who were not observed at two
different hospitals or who did not spend at least two years at a hospital.) We estimate
the following regression:
esjt = α + δtenurei(j,t) + γtenure_unsurei(j,t) + εsjt

(9)

P s ks
The dependent variable is esjt = K1s K
ks =1 ejt , the mean of residuals across all ks
outcome variables in set s for hospital year jt. The tenure variable takes discrete values
between 1 and 14. We allow for left censoring in our data by including the indicator
variable tenure_unsure, which takes the value 1 for CEO spells that start in 2000 and 0
otherwise. For the two non-stacked production measures (staff satisfaction and surplus)
we use the residuals ejt generated by Equation (5) as the dependent variable.
Table 12 presents the results. These results are very similar for both the 95 CEOs
included in the fixed effects approach and for all CEO spells. For the stacked sets of production measures the effect sizes are very small. Even the largest coefficient estimate (for
throughputs) suggests that 10 years of tenure would result in these outcomes being only
one-sixteenth of standard deviation above the expected level. For staff job satisfaction

All regressions include a dummy variable indicating that tenure is unsure. The residuals are from a
regression of the standardised stacked measures and the extra measures on hospital characteristics,
financial year effects and hospital effects. For the stacked measures, the residuals for the 4 or 5
outcome measures in each set are then averaged by hospital-year. “All CEO spells” excludes spells
at hospitals which we observe for only one year since hospital effects predict the outcome variable
perfectly. “All CEO spells” also excludes hospital-year observations for which we observe fewer
than 2 of the hospital production measures in a stacked set. Standard errors clustered at hospital
level. *Significant at 10%, **significant at 5%, ***significant at 1%

and surplus, however, there is a positive and significant correlation with CEO tenure. A
10-year tenure is associated with staff job satisfaction and surplus being one quarter of a
standard deviation above the expected level. The positive association between long tenure
on staff job satisfaction mirrors the finding from our event study in Table B-1 (described
in detail in Appendix B) that a CEO turnover event reduces staff job satisfaction. More
generally, these results provide some support to the idea that the short tenure of CEOs
in the NHS may dampen their ability to systematically impress their mark on the organizations they lead, though the possible endogeneity of CEO tenure make it hard to pin
down the direction of causality behind these correlations.

6.3

Match Effects

As discussed, the overall significance of the estimated CEO fixed effects is, in fact, a
reflection of hospital-period-specific variations in hospital production. This consideration
led us to examine whether certain individuals may perform better in certain environments.
Put another way, are there match effects, such that some individuals can achieve better
outcomes in certain environments but that this performance is not portable to another
environment?
To estimate the importance of such match effects, we adopt an approach similar to
Jackson (2013). We explore CEO characteristics and hospital characteristics that may
produce different matches. The CEO characteristics we focus on are those associated
with differences in CEO pay effects (see Table 5). They are being female, having a clinical
background, having leadership experience in the private sector and holding a postgraduate
management qualification. The hospital characteristics are standard dimensions on which
NHS (and other) hospitals differ: teaching status, foundation trust (hospitals which were
granted more autonomy by the regulator), hospitals located in competitive markets, and
large hospitals (measured in terms of beds).
We estimate the effect of interactions of CEO characteristics Wi and hospital characteristics Wj on the sets of production variables, staff job satisfaction and surplus using
the following regression:
ks
yjt

=

Ks
X

zks [X 0jt β + λt + ψj ] + δWi + γ(Wi × Wj ) + εkjts

(10)

ks =1
ks
As in Equation 4, yjt
is one of the Ks outcome variables in set s, X jt are timevarying observable hospital characteristics, λt are a set of financial year effects and ψj
a set of hospital effects. The interaction term Wi × Wj replaces the CEO effects αi(j,t)

from Equation 4. We also include the constitutive terms of the interaction term: the
CEO characteristic directly as Wi and the hospital characteristic indirectly through the
hospital fixed effects ψj .57
Table 13 presents the results. Each entry is the coefficient on the interaction term
from a separate regression. The rows indicate the interactions and are ordered by person
characteristics. The columns are the production measure sets. The table indicates that,
whilst there are not match effects for all combinations of person and hospital type, there
do seem to be hints of match effects which fit with the institutional set-up of the hospitals
we study.
First, female CEOs have better clinical outcomes in teaching hospitals, but at the expense of lower throughputs (which are more easily observed than clinical outcomes, perhaps explaining the lower pay of female CEOs). Second, CEOs with a clinical background
are associated with better clinical performance in teaching hospitals. These hospitals are
exactly those settings where it might be expected that clinically trained CEOs perform
best. Third, CEOs with leadership experience in the private sector appear to respond to
external incentives more than those with an NHS background, in that they achieve higher
surpluses when paired with a foundation trust, a setting in which surpluses are important
because they were required to achieve foundation trust status. On the other hand, as
perhaps would be expected of those regarded as adhering less to ‘NHS values’, they have
less staff job satisfaction when operating in a competitive market.58
Overall, for the CEO characteristics gender, clinical background and private sector
experience, it appears that certain CEO-hospital matches results in higher production
than other matches. This analysis is subject to the caveat that our samples are small
and any match effects may therefore be driven by a small number of individuals observed
in particular hospital settings. It is also likely that matching happens along CEO and
hospital characteristics that are unobservable to us (e.g. CEO social or leadership skills.)

Conclusions

In this paper we examine whether the CEOs of large public sector entities have an impact
on the performance of those organizations. Our focus is large public hospitals, for which we
assemble rich information on CEOs and a large number of hospital production measures.
We find that the pay of NHS CEOs differs systematically and persistently. However,
57

We can extend this analysis to include all CEO spells in our data set but, as we are exploring whether
match effects explain the absence of persistent CEO impacts, we present results for only the 95 CEOs
used in the fixed effects approach. Results for all CEO spells are in Web Appendix.
58
Results for all observed CEO spells in Table W-19 in the Web Appendix are broadly similar.

43

we find little evidence of CEOs being systematically able to change the performance of
hospitals.59 Our results do not seem to be driven by the allocation of better performing
CEO, as measured either by performance or in terms of their individual pay effect, to
worse performing hospitals. But we provide suggestive evidence that NHS CEOs may
be in post for too short a time to have an effect, and that certain CEOs may matter in
certain conditions, i.e. that there are CEO-hospital match effects. These match effects,
together with the short tenure of hospital CEOs in the English NHS system, may be the
reason why certain CEOs are paid more than others: when the average tenure period is
short, the market cannot distinguish between a good match and good performance in all
settings.
More broadly, there are at least two possible explanations for our findings. The first is
public sector-specific. The NHS is central in political discourse in the UK. Its importance
means that politicians are very concerned about NHS performance, particularly negative
performance, and are also keen to be seen to be doing something, which is generally manifest in a desire to implement new policies. The lack of persistent CEO effects is consistent
with a scenario in which top managers simply chase political goals, rather than policies
that might actually improve hospital performance (see, for example, qualitative studies
in Powell & Davies (2016). In this context, the rational response of a NHS CEO is not
necessarily to improve the long-term performance of the hospital but, instead, to minimize
the amount of bad news that ends up on the Secretary of State’s desk. This situation may
explain why there is a CEO effect in remuneration that is not associated with observed
hospital performance but is associated with receiving a public honour. Furthermore, the
political nature of the NHS may also lead to reluctance of high performers to seek CEO
appointments, thus inducing negative sorting.
A second explanation is that hospitals are large complex organizations, in which highly
trained (and hard to monitor) individuals run separate but interconnected production
processes. Management at the very top of such organizations may find it difficult to
engage in coordination and getting a large number of actors, who traditionally have not
worked together, to work cooperatively. Put another way, a possible interpretation of
our finding is that the organizational inertia of a large hospital is too strong for a single
manager – even if this person is the CEO – to be able to impact performance within the
short time period in which they are in office, and consistently across organizations. This
situation, of course, is not specific to public sector hospitals. But it may have more of
an effect in hospitals, public or private, where there are many dimensions of performance

In a complementary non-parametric study reported in Appendix B we also find no evidence that a
change in CEO brings about an improvement (or even just a change) in performance.

(clinical, access, financial) that can be pursued and can in the short run conflict. This
inertia may also be exacerbated by the often much longer contract durations of clinical
staff relative to CEOs.
Regardless of the underlying drivers of our results, they raise concerns about the
plausibility of policy approaches that focus on the use of transient “turnaround” CEOs to
improve the performance of individual hospitals. A leading NHS manager recently argued
that it takes five years for a CEO to make a difference but the average time in post is much
shorter than that.60 Coupled with the findings of Tsai et al. (2015) and Bloom, Propper,
Seiler & van Reenen (2015) that the management capabilities of middle managers in
hospitals are systematically associated with better outcomes, our paper suggests that
rather than seeking to rapidly change hospital performance through the appointment of a
cadre of “superheads”, strategies for improvement should instead focus on nurturing and
sustaining the skills of middle managers.

Appendix A

Definitions and Sources of Variables Used
in Analysis

Tables A-1 and A-2 provide the data sources for all variables. The pay data are available
only in bands of £5,000. We use the midpoint for each band as an approximation of
the underlying continuous variable. For example, a basic salary reported as £120,000£125,000 is recorded as £122,500 in our data set. The time-varying observable hospital
level variables, X j(i,t) are foundation trust status, year of merger, years since merger,
beds, technology index and case mix variables.
Technology Index The technology index can take any value between 0 and 1. It is
the weighted average of 7 dummy variables indicating the availability of advanced technologies: a neonatal intensive care unit, a cardiology unit, magnetic resonance imaging,
imaging using radio-isotopes, heart or lung transplants, open heart surgery and percutaneous coronary interventions. The weight for each of these technologies is the proportion
of hospitals that do not possess that technology at the beginning of our sample in 2000/01.
The resulting index value increases over the sample period as hospitals add technologies.
We use data from a wide range of administrative sources to generate the 7 dummy
variables. A hospital is defined as having a neonatal intensive care unit if it has at least
one bed in a neonatal intensive care unit, as reported in the beds data published annually
in the Hospital Activity Statistics by NHS England. A hospital is defined as having a
cardiology unit if according to annual Hospital Episode Statistics it delivered at least 10
finished consultant episodes in a cardiology speciality. We define a hospital as offering
magnetic resonance imaging if according to the annual imaging data published as part
of Hospital Activity Statistics by NHS England it delivered at least 100 examinations or
tests using magnetic resonance imaging. Numbers in this data set tend to be around 1,000
to 30,000; so numbers smaller than 100 might be data entry errors. Similarly, we define
a hospital as offering imaging using radio-isotopes if the annual imaging data reports at
least 100 examinations or tests using radio-isotopes.
Further, we define a hospital as providing heart or lung transplants if the annual Hospital Episode Statistics report at least 2 transplant procedures (HRGs E01 and E02), as
providing open heart surgery if the annual Hospital Episode Statistics report at least 10
open heart surgery procedures (HRGs E01 to E04) and as providing percutaneous coronary interventions (OPCS codes K49 and K75) if the annual Hospital Episode Statistics
report at least 10 such interventions.
Once a dummy variable takes the value one, we set its value to one in all following

years, to avoid fluctuations that are most likely caused by data entry errors rather than
real changes.
Hospital Commission Rating We use ratings for the financial years 2002/03 to
2007/08. Ratings for the years 2002/02 to 2004/05 used stars, with three stars awarded
to hospitals with the “highest levels of performance”, two stars awarded to hospitals that
are “performing well overall, but have not quite reached the same consistently high standards”, one star awarded to hospitals “where there is some cause for concern regarding
particular key targets” and zero stars awarded to hospitals “that have shown the poorest
levels of performance against key targets” (Department of Health 2001). We classify zero
stars and one star as a poor rating.
For the years 2005/06 to 2007/08 the Hospital Commission published ratings using a
four-point scale of “excellent”, “good”, “fair” and “weak” (Healthcare Commission undated).
Each hospital received two scores, one for quality of services and one for use of resources
(Healthcare Commission undated). We use the score for quality of services and classify
scores of “fair” and “weak” as a poor rating. Ideally, we want to use the hospital commission
rating from the year before the CEO arrived. Because of data limitations we can use this
definition only for the financial years 2003/04 to 2008/09. For the financial year 2002/03
we use the contemporanous rating, for 2009/10 the rating from two years before the CEO
arrived and for 2010/11 the rating from three years before the CEO arrived.
Competitive Market The competitive market variable is a dummy variable that takes
the value 1 if the hospital is located in a competitive market. To measure hospital competition we use a method similar to Bloom, Propper, Seiler & van Reenen (2015). First,
we calculate the Euclidean distance (in km) for each pairwise combination of all hospitals
in our data. For this calculation we use the geographical coordinates associated with the
postcode of the hospital trust’s headquarters. Next, we count the number of competitors
within a 30 km radius. Finally, we calculate the quartiles of these counts for each region.
If a hospital is in the top quartile for its region, we classify it as operating in a competitive
market.

Appendix B

Non-parametric Approach

The fixed effects approach relies heavily on our statistical model of hospital production,
since both Equation 4 and Equation 7 use the residuals from this statistical model to
estimate the impact of individual CEOs. Both equations also rely on CEOs having an
51

impact on the same dimension of hospital production across two hospitals. We use a nonparametric approach to sidestep both problems. Our approach resembles a differencein-difference estimator combined with matching. We compare the changes in hospital
production following a CEO turnover event to changes in hospital production at matched
hospitals without a CEO turnover event. If there is any impact of CEOs on hospital
production, we expect to see different changes after a CEO turnover event compared to
changes at otherwise similar hospitals with no CEO turnover event.
The starting point for this analysis are all CEO turnover events in our sample (i.e.
not just the turnover events of the CEOs who have at least two observations for at least
two of the outcome variables in set s at two different hospitals). We begin by identifying
hospitals that had a CEO turnover event that resulted in subsequent stable leadership of at
least two years. Next, we select from this set of observations those CEO turnovers events
that were preceded by two years of stable leadership. This selection criterion excludes
those NHS hospitals characterized by frequent CEO turnovers within a short time period
– most likely hospitals in a crisis – for which it is hard to find a suitable control group.
In summary, the treated observations are hospitals with a CEO turnover event in t and
the new CEO staying on in t + 1 and no CEO turnover in t − 1 and t − 2.
We match each treated observation to one or three control hospitals with no CEO
turnover event over the period t − 2 to t + 1. We then compare the difference in our
hospital production measures between the year before the CEO turnover event and the
end of the two-year period, i.e. between t − 1 and t + 1, to the equivalent difference in the
matched hospitals. For our sets of input, throughput and clinical performance measures
we implement a stacked version by simply comparing the differences in all (standardised)
production measures at the treated hospital to the differences in all measures at the
control hospital.
We match – with replacement – treated hospitals to control hospitals exactly on year,
teaching status, specialist status and foundation trust status in t − 1.61 This tends to
result in more than one match for each treated hospital. Therefore, in the next step, we
use closest neighbor matching on beds in t−1 to choose one or three control hospitals from
among the exactly matched hospitals. Where closest neighbor matching on beds results in
ties, we choose from among the (usually two) hospitals with the same absolute difference
in number of beds the closest neighbor in terms of the technology index in t − 1.62
61

Matching on teaching status implies matching treated major teaching hospitals to control major
teaching hospitals and treated minor teaching hospitals to control minor teaching hospitals. For specialist
status we match only on the broad definition of specialist hospital. Teaching and specialist status are
fixed characteristics, foundation trust status is time-varying.
62
Matching exactly on year implies that we compare, for example, the difference in waiting times

mean of the change, P 1nks K

j=1 yj(t+1) − yj(t−1) , and its standard error for both

variance. We report the same statistics for the staff job satisfaction and surplus measures,

P
with the mean of the change being n1 nj=1 yj(t+1) − yj(t−1) .
The sample used for this analysis differs from that used for the parametric analyses
as it (a) uses CEO turnover events (multiplied by the number of variables in each stacked
set) rather than all hospital-year observations and (b) includes as potential treated observations all CEO turnover events rather than only the turnover events for the 95 CEOs
for whom we estimated CEO fixed effects.
Estimates Table B-1 presents the results for the stacked input, throughput and clinical
performance measures as well as staff job satisfaction and surplus.63 1:1 and 1:3 matching
give similar results. These suggest there are no changes in the hospital production measures after a new CEO is employed except for staff satisfaction which grows at a slower
pace following a CEO turnover.
To assess the balance of the matched samples, Table B-2 reports for the treated and the
control observations the means of the hospital characteristics that we include as control
variables in the wage equation (2) and in the regressions (4) and (7). Table B-2 also
show the means of the characteristics we match exactly on (teaching status, specialist
status and foundation trust status). For almost all the measures there is little difference
between the treated and the control samples, with the exception of the number of beds,
which is slightly larger for the treated sample. We conclude that the matching produces
good balance on observables.64
Table W-14 in the Web Appendix presents a robustness test that applies our nonparametric approach to only the 95 CEOs used in our parametric estimates.65 The rebetween 2006 and 2008 for a hospital with a CEO turnover event in 2007 to the difference in waiting
times between 2006 and 2008 for a hospital with no CEO turnover event in 2007. Thus our results will
not be confounded by period effects (Gaynor et al. 2012).
63
We repeat these analyses for each of the variables in the sets separately. These results corroborate
the findings presented here. See Tables W-10 and W-11 in the Web Appendix.
64
Table W-12 in Web Appendix checks the common trend assumption by examining changes in hospital
production in the two-year period preceding the CEO turnover event analysed in Table B-1. Changes
observed in treated are similar to changes in control hospitals, supporting the parallel trend assumption.
The only exception is for the input measures which increase more in treated hospitals (Table W-13 in
Web Appendix). This apparent favourable trend in inputs prior to the CEO turnover event makes our
findings of a fall in staff job satisfaction even more striking.
65
We limit the potential treated observations to the 95 CEOs. The number of CEO turnover events in
this analysis is less than 95 x 2 because of our selection criteria. See notes for Table W-14.

All outcome variables are standardised to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. Some
outcome variables in the stacked sets are multiplied by (-1), so that “more” means “better”. Treated
observations are hospital-years with a CEO turnover event in t, the new CEO still in post in t + 1
and no CEO turnover event in t − 1 and t − 2. One or up to three controls are chosen from hospitalyears with no CEO turnover event in t, t + 1, t − 1 and t − 2. The change in outcome variable
is yj(t+1) − yj(t−1) . Controls are matched exactly on year, major teaching hospital, minor teaching
hospital, specialist hospital and foundation trust status, followed by closest neighbour matching on
beds. In case of ties, closest neighbour matching on beds is followed by closest neighbour matching on
technology index. Foundation trust status, beds and technology index as of t − 1; teaching status and
specialist status are permanent characteristics. Standard error and p-value for difference in means
from two-sample t-tests with equal variance.

54

sults are similar to those here: there are no changes in the hospital production measures
following a CEO turnover event with the exception of staff job satisfaction.66 Table W-15
in the Web Appendix examines changes over the three years following the CEO turnover
event rather than only two years.67 Again, there is a negative impact on staff satisfaction, though due to the smaller sample size this effect is less precisely estimated. We
conclude that, with the possible exception of a negative impact on staff satisfaction, a
CEO turnover event does not appear to impact on hospital production.68

66

For the throughput measures 1:1 matching suggests a statistically significant impact of a CEO
turnover event. The estimated effect size, however, is very small, especially compared to the estimated
effect size for staff job satisfaction. Job satisfaction is estimated to drop by one-quarter of a standard
deviation. Throughput measures are estimated to increase by one-twentieth of a standard deviation.
67
The number of CEO turnover events included in this analysis is smaller than in Table B-1 as we
require the new CEO to be still in post in t + 2 to calculate changes between the year before the CEO
turnover event, t − 1, and three years later, t + 2.
68
We also examine the impact of a CEO turnover event on the quality of middle management, using data
from the 2006 and 2009 waves of the World Management Survey. There are only 9 treated observations, so
the effect estimate is imprecise but, if anything, it suggests that a turnover event decreases management
quality. See Web Appendix.

Differences between SIC 92 and SIC 2007 industry classifications

Figure 2 in Section 2.3 presents pay of top managers in industries with both public and
private sector organizations over the period 2000 to 2017. As the industry classification
was changed substantially in 2009, we present separate graphs for 2000-2008 and 20092017. Here we describe the relevant changes in more detail.
Data for 2000 to 2008 use the “UK Standard Industrial Classification of Economic
Activites - SIC 92” while data for 2009 to 2017 use the the “UK Standard Industrial
Classification of Economic Activities - SIC 2007”. In SIC 92 the section “K - Real estate,
renting and business activities” includes “73.10 Research and experimental development
on natural sciences and engineering” and “73.20 Research and experimental development
on social sciences and humanities”. In SIC 2007 these activities have been subsumed into
the new section “M - Professional, scientific and technical activities”. The SIC 92 section
“I - Transport, storage and communication” includes “60.1 Transport via railways”, “60.21
Other scheduled passenger land transport” and “64.11 National post activities”. These
industries are comparable to the SIC 2007 section “H - Transportation and storage”,
which includes “49.10 Passenger rail transport interurban”, “49.31 Urban and suburban
passenger land transport” and “53.10 Postal activities under universal service obligation”.
The SIC 92 section “J - Financial intermediation” includes “65.11 Central banking”
and “66.02 Pension funding”. Similarly, the SIC 2007 section “K - Financial and Insurance
Activities” includes “64.11 Central banking” and “65.30 Pension funding”. The SIC 92
section “L - Public administration and defence, compulsory social security” includes “75.24
Public security, land and order activities”, which is comparable to the SIC 2007 section
“O - Public administration and defence, compulsory social security”, which includes “84.23
Justice and judicial activities” and “84.24 Public order and safety activities”. The SIC
92 section “O - Other community, social and personal service activities” includes “92
Recreational, cultural and sporting activities”. In SIC 2007 these activities have been
subsumed into the new section section “R - Arts, entertainment and recreation”.

Properties of the hospital effects in pay

Figure W-1a shows the distribution of the estimated hospital effects in pay, ψ[
j(i,t) . Since
the ψj(i,t) are estimated relative to an arbitrary omitted hospital, we transform the estimates into deviations from the mean of all ψj(i,t) . At 25% of hospitals the executive
directors are paid an extra £7,690 or more in total pay, holding our basic set of timevarying hospital characteristics and all time-invariant executive director characteristics
constant. Similarly, at 25% of hospitals the executive directors receive pay packages that
are £8,500 or more below the average pay package.
Figure W-1b shows the distribution of the hospital effects in pay after adjusting the
estimates for sampling error using the empirical Bayes procedure, with the estimates
shrunk towards the regional means.69 The distribution is only slightly narrower, with the
interquartile range dropping from £16,000 to £13,000 after shrinkage.
Table W-3 explores the determinants of the hospital effects in pay using linear regressions of the estimated hospital effects on a set of dummy variables indicating time-invariant
hospital characteristics. Results in the first major column are for the original effect estimates while results in the second major column are for the hospital effect estimates
shrunk towards the regional means. In general, the results are similar but unsurprisingly
the coefficients for the shrunk hospital effect estimates are estimated more precisely.
The first specification in Table W-3 explores the impact of the region where the hospital
69

We employ the empirical Bayes shrinkage estimator described in Chandra et al. (2016).

is based on executive director pay. We expect the hospital effects to reflect differences in
the cost of living across the different regions in England. The omitted region being the
North West, the constant of −£ 6,828 for the original effect estimates is the North West
average of the deviations from the mean of all estimated hospital effects for total pay. As
the coefficient estimates for all other regions are positive, the North West is the region
with the lowest hospital effects. The regions with the largest hospital effects are London
and the South East, which reflects the higher cost of living in these regions.
The ranking of the coefficients for the remaining regions does not reflect the ranking
of the cost of living. The North East dummy, the Yorkshire and Humber dummy and
the East Midlands dummy have the next largest coefficients, while the coefficient on the
South West dummy is small and not statistically significantly different from zero. Once
we add dummy variables indicating whether a hospital is a major teaching hospital, a
minor teaching hospital, a specialist acute hospital or a specialist orthopaedic hospital
the coefficients on the North East dummy, the Yorkshire and Humber dummy and the
East Midlands dummy drop by £2,000 to £4,000, suggesting some of these unexpectedly
large hospital effects are driven by the teaching status and specialist status of hospitals in
these regions. However, average hospital effects for hospitals in the North East, Yorkshire
and Humber and the West Midlands are still larger than for hospitals in the South West
and the East of England, which tend to have higher cost of living.
Potentially, factors other than the cost of living drive these regional differences in the
estimated hospital effects. For example, hospitals in the North East might have more
difficulties in attracting and retaining good managers than hospitals in the South West
and therefore have to offer a pay premium.
Hospital effects at teaching hospitals are statistically significantly larger than at nonteaching hospitals while hospital effects at specialist hospitals are statistically significantly
smaller than at general hospitals. Combining the two largest coefficient estimates, the
hospital effect of a major teaching hospital in London is on average −£ 7,618 + £ 12,266
+ £ 14,752 = £ 19,400 above the sample average of the hospital effects in total pay, well
above the 75th percentile of the distribution of deviations from the mean of all hospital
effects displayed in Figure W-1.
Overall, the region dummies, the teaching status dummies and the specialist status
dummies jointly explain around 40% of the variation in the hospital effects.

Parametric estimates of CEO effects in hospital production
using hospital production measures separately in their original units

Tables W-5, W-6 and W-7 present estimates of Equation 3 using the actual CEO-hospital
matches as well as the random CEO-hospital matches for the separate input, throughput
and clinical performance measures. As for the stacked estimations reported in Section
5.2, when using the actual CEO-hospital matches the F-tests suggest that the estimated
CEO effects are jointly statistically significantly different from zero and the proportion
of individually statistically significant CEO effects ranges from 25.0% for MRSA rates to
36.1% for stroke deaths. And as for the stacked estimations reported in Section 5.2, when
using the random CEO-hospital matches the F-statistics across the 100 replications are as
large as they are for the actual CEO-hospital matches and the proportion of CEO effects
that are individually statistically significant is similar to the proportion for the actual
CEO-hospital matches.
For some of the measures the variance proportions explained by the covariates, hospital
effects and CEO effects are invalid due to one of the proportions being negative. For the
measures with valid variance proportions, the mean variance proportion explained by the
CEO effects using the random CEO-hospital matches tends to be close to the variance
proportion explained by the CEO effects using the actual CEO-hospital matches.
Table W-8 presents estimates of Equation 6 for the separate input, throughput and
performance measures. For most variables, we do not find evidence of any impact of
individual CEOs on hospital performance. The results for MRSA rates hint at larger
than expected MRSA rates in the first hospital being associated with larger than expected
MRSA rates in the second hospital, with the coefficient estimate δˆ2 taking the value 0.10.
This estimate, however, is not statistically significantly different from zero with a p-value
of 0.33. Also, the explanatory power of the average deviations from the expected MRSA
rates in the first hospital is very low with an R2 of 0.01. For AMI deaths the coefficient
estimate δˆ2 takes the value −0.17, suggesting larger than expected AMI death rates in the
first hospital are associated with smaller than expected AMI death rates in the second
hospital and vice versa. This coefficient is more precisely estimated with a p-value of 0.12
and the explanatory power of the average deviations from the expected AMI death rates
in the first hospital is slightly larger with an R2 of 0.04. However, the negative coefficient
suggests that there is no impact of individual CEOs on AMI death rates.

W-7

Validity of two-step procedure

We assess the validity of the two-step procedure by estimating Equations 7 and 8 for both
actual CEO-hospital matches and random CEO-hospital matches. Table W-9 presents
the results for the stacked and the two individual hospital production measures.
Looking at the results for the regressions using random CEO-hospital matches in the
second and third row of each panel, we see that the coefficient estimates δ̂2 are very
small, with the mean coefficient estimates across the 100 replications ranging from −0.01
to 0.003. The next column shows the proportion of t-tests across our 100 replications
that reject the hypothesis that δ̂2 is equal to zero when using a significance level of 10%.
The rejection frequency is around 10% and therefore close to the nominal level of the
test. Overall, the results for the random CEO-hospital matches show no impact of CEOs,
exactly what we would expect for random matches, suggesting the two-step procedure is
valid.

Results in Column 1 are from regressions of mean of residuals for CEO spell in second hospital on mean of
residuals for CEO spell in first hospital. Results in Column 2 are from regressions of mean of residuals for
CEO spell in second hospital on mean of residuals in second hospital during the three years before CEO
was appointed. The residuals are from a regression of the stacked measures or the individual measures on
hospital characteristics, financial year effects and hospital effects. For the stacked measures, the residuals for
the 4 or 5 outcome measures in each group are then averaged by hospital-year before the mean of residuals
for each of a CEO’s spells is being calculated. The results for random CEO-hospital matches are means and
standard deviations across 100 replications. *Significant at 10%, **significant at 5%, ***significant at 1%

W-8

Non-parametric estimates of CEO effects in hospital production using hospital production measures separately in
their original units

Tables W-10 and W-11 present results for the non-parametric approach using the separate
input, throughput and clinical performance measures. We see that, in the main, inputs
do not change after a new CEO is post. There is one exception, a fall in length of stay.
We also see that on balance clinical performance does not improve, with improvements
on some measures matched by reductions in other measures.

Treated observations are hospital-years with a CEO turnover event in t, the new CEO still in post

hospital-years with no CEO turnover event in t, t + 1, t − 1 and t − 2. The change in outcome variable
is yj(t+1) − yj(t−1) . Controls are matched exactly on year, major teaching hospital, minor teaching
hospital, specialist hospital and foundation trust status, followed by closest neighbour matching on
beds. In case of ties, closest neighbour matching on beds is followed by closest neighbour matching on
technology index. Foundation trust status, beds and technology index as of t − 1; teaching status and
specialist status are permanent characteristics. Standard error and p-value for difference in means

Additional non-parametric estimates of CEOs’ impact on
hospital behaviour and performance

Table W-12 examines changes in the hospital production measures over the two-year
period preceding the CEO turnover event as a check of the common trends assumption.
Table W-13 repeats this analysis for the input measures separately in their original units.
Table W-14 repeats the analysis in Table B-1 but limits the potential treated observations
to the 95 CEOs included in our parametric approach.

Surplus

All outcome variables are standardised to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. Some
outcome variables in the stacked sets are multiplied by (-1), so that “more” means “better”. The change
in outcome variable is yj(t−1) − yj(t−3) . The number of treated observations is less than the number of
treated observations in Table B-1 because for some treated observations we do not observe the lagged
change in the outcome variable. For details on selection of treated and control observation refer to
notes in Table B-1. Standard error and p-value for difference in means from two-sample t-tests with
equal variance.

Table W-16 presents non-parametric results for the subset of hospitals for whom we
observe an average management score in both the 2006 and the 2009 wave of the World
Management Survey. Thus, we can include hospitals with a CEO turnover event in 2007
or 2008. There are only 9 treated observations, so the effect estimate is very imprecise.
However, there is no indication of a CEO turnover event improving management practices.

All outcome variables are standardised to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. Some
outcome variables in the stacked sets are multiplied by (-1), so that “more” means “better”. The change
in outcome variable is yj(t−1) − yj(t−3) . The number of treated observations is less than the number
of treated observations in Table W-10 because for some treated observations we do not observe the
lagged change in the outcome variable. For details on selection of treated and control observation
refer to notes in Table W-10. Standard error and p-value for difference in means from two-sample

All outcome variables are standardised to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. Some
outcome variables in the stacked sets are multiplied by (-1), so that “more” means “better”. The
maximum number of treated observations is less than 95 CEOs x 2 hospitals x 5 measures in a set =
950 for the following reasons: Treated observations are hospital-years with a CEO turnover event in
t, the new CEO still in post in t + 1 and no CEO turnover event in t − 1 and t − 2. We cannot use
observations for 2000/01 and 2001/02 since we cannot establish whether there was no turnover event
in t − 1 and t − 2. One or up to three controls are chosen from hospital-years with no CEO turnover
event in t, t + 1, t − 1 and t − 2. Controls are matched exactly on year, major teaching hospital, minor
teaching hospital, specialist hospital and foundation trust status. Some treated observations remain
without a match. Exact matching is followed by closest neighbour matching on beds. In case of ties,
closest neighbour matching on beds is followed by closest neighbour matching on technology index.
Foundation trust status, beds and technology index as of t − 1; teaching status and specialist status
are permanent characteristics. The change in outcome variable is yj(t+1) − yj(t−1) . Standard error

If anything, a turnover event decreases the average management score.
Table W-16 also presents estimates of the impact of a CEO turnover event on how
much hospitals spend on CEO remuneration. The estimates suggest that as a result of a
CEO turnover event hospitals’ spending on CEO remuneration increases by about £7,500
more than it would have done in the absence of a turnover event. However, the last panel
of Table W-16 shows that the parallel trend assumption for hospital spending on CEO
pay is unlikely to be satisfied, since it increased by about £7,400 less in treated hospitals
over the two-year period before the CEO turnover event.

W-10

Endogenous assignment analyses using input, throughput
and performance measures separately in their original units

We examine whether CEOs who did well at their first hospital are subsequently hired at
a problematic hospital. We define doing well relative to a CEO’s peers using the mean
residual from Equation 5 for the financial years ti,A
to ti,A
1
n when CEO i is observed in
hospital A. For length of stay, waiting time, canceled operations, AMI deaths, stroke
deaths, FPF deaths, readmissions and MRSA rate we classify as good performers CEOs
whose mean residual is at or below the 25th percentile. For technology, day cases and
admissions we define as good performers CEOs whose mean residual is at or above the
75th percentile. We omit from this analysis input variables (such as beds and labour skills
ratios) because it is unclear what would be considered good performance along these
dimensions.
Table W-17 presents results for linear probability models regressing an indicator of
moving to a “problematic” hospital on an indicator of good performance at a CEO’s first
hospital. There are 11 production measures × 4 definitions of “problematic”, generating a
total of 44 coefficient estimates. 6 of these estimates, i.e. 13.6% are statistically significant
at the 10% level, but there is no clear pattern in the direction of association. For 1
production measure better performance immediately prior to arrival is associated with
being at problematic hospital, but for 5 measures the association is negative.
Next, we examine whether the variability measure is larger for CEOs who are at some
point in their career assigned to “problematic” hospitals. For each of our four definitions
of “problematic”, we regress each of our 15 variability measures against a dummy variable
indicating that the CEO was ever observed in a “problematic” hospital. Thus, we run
60 separate regressions and obtain 60 coefficients on a “problematic” hospital dummy
variable. The results are in Table W-18. 6 out of the 60 coefficients, i.e. 10%, are
statistically significantly different from zero at the 10% significance level, a result we
would expect just by chance. Furthermore, only three of them (for waiting times, cancelled
operations and admissions) are positive, suggesting that being at a “problematic” hospital
is associated with higher variability in CEO performance. For the other three statistically
significant coefficients the estimated association is negative, suggesting that CEOs who
are at some point at a more problematic hospital actually have lower variability in their
performance across hospitals.

Each entry in this table refers to a separate regression of an indicator of a CEO moving to a “problematic” hospital on an indicator of good performance at
the CEO’s first hospital. “Problematic” hospital is defined as either poor hospital commission rating, surplus below 25th percentile, hospital created through
merger or hospital with PFI contract. Good performance at the CEO’s first hospital is defined as the mean residual for the CEO spell at the first hospital
being at or below the 25th percentile for length of stay, waiting time, cancelled operations, AMI deaths, stroke deaths, FPF deaths, readmissions and MRSA
rate and as the mean residual being at or above the 75th percentile for technology, day cases, admissions. Standard errors in (parentheses). *Significant at

Each estimate is from a separate regression of the stacked measures on hospital characteristics, financial year
effects, hospital effects, the relevant CEO characteristic and the interaction of the relevant CEO characteristic
and hospital characteristic. All outcome variables in a stacked set as well as the individual outcome variables
are standardised to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. Some outcome variables in the stacked
sets are multiplied by (-1), so that “more” means “better”. Standard errors in (parentheses). *Significant at
10%, **significant at 5%, ***significant at 1%
