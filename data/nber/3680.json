In particular, the literature on dynamic factor demand models has, until recently, largely overlooked the issue of capital utilization and/or did not distinguish carefully between the distinct concepts of capital and capacity utilization. In this paper we allow for variations in the rate of capital utilization within the context of a dynamic factor demand model by adopting a modeling framework within which the firm combines its beginning-of-period stocks with other inputs to produce its outputs as well as its end-of-period stocks. We also derive measures of productivity and capacity utilization for the adopted modeling framework. Given the depreciation rate is endogenous a consistent capital stock series must be generated during estimation from the investment data. This yields, as a byproduct, a consistent decon1position of gross investment into replacement and expansion investment. As an illustration, the model is applied to U.S. Electrical Machinery data.\n\n",
