    "abstract": "\n\nMost of the rise in overall earnings inequality is accounted for by rising between-industry dispersion from ten percent of 4-digit NAICS industries. These thirty industries are clustered especially in high-paying high-tech and low-paying retail sectors. The rise of employment in mega firms is concentrated in the industries that dominate rising earnings inequality. Earnings differentials for the mega firms relative to small firms decline in the low-paying industries but increase in the high-paying industries. A critical component accounting for the rising dispersion in the top thirty industries is an increasing covariance between industry premia and worker characteristics associated with high earnings.\n\n",
