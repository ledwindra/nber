The Effect of the 1998 Master Settlement on Prenatal Smoking
Douglas E. Levy and Ellen Meara
NBER Working Paper No. 11176
March 2005
JEL No. I12, I18
ABSTRACT
The Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) between the major tobacco companies and 46 states
created an abrupt 45 cent (21%) increase in cigarette prices in November, 1998. Earlier estimates
of the elasticity of prenatal smoking implied that the price rise would reduce prenatal cigarette
smoking by 7% to 21%. Using birth records on 10 million U.S. births between January 1996 and
February 2000, we examined the change in smoking during pregnancy and conditional smoking
intensity in response to the MSA. Overall, adjusting for secular trends in smoking, prenatal smoking
declined much less than predicted in response to the MSA.

1. Introduction
On November 23rd, 1998, the attorneys general for 46 states suing the major United
States tobacco companies reached the Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) with the defendants
who agreed to pay the states $206 billion (Capehart, 2001). To finance the settlement, tobacco
companies immediately increased cigarette prices by 45 cents (21%) nationwide (Capehart,
2001). Cigarette prices rose another 42 cents over the following two years. The rise in prices
constitutes the most important smoking-related consequence of the MSA (Cutler et al., 2002;
Schroeder, 2004). We examine the effect on prenatal smoking of the unprecedented increase in
cigarette prices following the MSA.
Two decades of research suggests that raising cigarette prices is an effective means of
reducing population smoking prevalence. Estimates of the price elasticity of smoking
participation range from -0.15 to -0.26 (Lewitt and Coate, 1982; Wasserman et al., 1991; Hu et
al., 1995; Farrelly and Bray, 1998). Specific populations, however, are known to be more or less
price sensitive (Chaloupka and Warner, 2000). Studies of pregnant women suggest that the price
elasticity of prenatal smoking participation is substantially higher than in the general population,
with estimates typically greater than -0.35 (Evans and Ringel, 1999; Gruber and Köszegi, 2001;
Gruber and Zinman, 2001; Ringel and Evans, 2001; Bradford, 2003; Colman et al., 2003), and
even as high as -1.83 (Lien and Evans, 2004).
Evidence of smokers’ price responsiveness has made raising excise taxes a common
policy lever for reducing cigarette smoking. Between 1990 and 1998, the average retail price of a
pack of cigarettes rose from $1.53 to $2.18 and state and federal excise taxes combined increased
from an average of $0.39 to $0.63 (Orzechowski and Walker, 2003). The MSA provides an
opportunity to examine how a large, nationwide price increase affects prenatal smoking

3

compared with the incremental changes in cigarette prices seen during the years preceding the
MSA.
Prenatal smoking is the most important modifiable risk factor associated with low birth
weight (LBW; <2500g), contributing to an estimated 20% of LBW births (USDHHS, 1990). On
average, prenatal smoking is estimated to raise the odds of LBW by 20-230%, depending on
prenatal smoking intensity (USDHHS, 2001). Because over 520,000 babies are born annually to
women who smoke during pregnancy, changes in prenatal smoking warrant scrutiny in any
evaluation of the overall health impact of the MSA.
In this paper, we use data from the National Vital Statistics System's Natality Detail File
to examine the effect of the MSA and its immediate 45 cent price increase on prenatal smoking
participation and conditional intensity of smoking for pregnant smokers. We compared smoking
related outcomes before and after the MSA and we estimated relative price regressions that
exploited the wide variation in the relative price change following the MSA to measure the
change in prenatal smoking behavior following the MSA. The majority of price elasticity
estimates suggest that the immediate price shock from the MSA would reduce prenatal smoking
by at least 7.4%. In the medium run, given an additional 42 cent price rise over the following
two years that is likely to be attributable, in part, to the MSA, one should expect an even larger
decline in prenatal smoking participation.
Overall, pregnant women responded much less than expected to this unprecedented
increase in the price of cigarettes. Compared with the level of prenatal smoking participation
predicted by the secular trends leading up to the MSA, pregnant women reduced smoking by less
than 3%. Teenage mothers were the most responsive group, reducing smoking by just over 8%

4

compared to that predicted by secular trends leading up to the MSA. The relative price models
yield no evidence of price responsiveness among our sample of pregnant women.
The remainder of the paper will proceed as follows: in section 2, we describe in detail the
previous literature on cigarette prices and prenatal smoking; in section 3, we outline our
empirical specification for estimating the effect of the MSA net of secular trends during this time
period; in section 4 we present the results of our analysis of smoking trends before and after the
MSA, including two tests to determine whether our results are robust to important assumptions
in our specifications; in section 5 we describe and present estimates of the effect of differential
relative price changes on prenatal smoking behavior; and in section 6 we compare our estimates
to the prior literature and discuss potential explanations for the smaller than expected price
response.

2. Prior Research on Price Responsiveness and Prenatal Smoking
Recent research on the response of pregnant women to cigarette price changes has
yielded disparate estimates of prenatal smoking elasticities (Evans and Ringel, 1999; Gruber and
Köszegi, 2001; Gruber and Zinman, 2001; Ringel and Evans, 2001; Bradford, 2003; Colman et
al., 2003; Lien and Evans, 2004). In the earliest such study, Evans and Ringel (1999) estimate
the price elasticity of prenatal smoking participation to be -0.50 by using a sample of 10.5
million birth records from the Natality Detail Files to identify the response of pregnant women to
within-state variation in excise taxes between 1989 and 1992. In a closely related article using
the same data for years 1989-1995, Ringel and Evans (2001) estimate that the overall price
elasticity of prenatal smoking participation is -0.7 and that the price response varies widely by
maternal race and education. Their findings suggest that the groups who would respond least to a

5

tax change would be teenage mothers, Hispanic mothers, and those with less education. Both of
these studies exploit variation stemming from relatively modest cigarette tax changes, and thus
their elasticity estimates should be viewed as most reliable for predicting the response to
relatively small price changes. In a complement to this earlier work, Lien and Evans (2004),
again use the Natality Detail Files to evaluate changes in prenatal smoking in response to large
tax changes (between 14 and 50 cents ) in four states during 1993 and 1994. These estimates
yield state-specific prenatal smoking participation elasticities ranging from -0.10 in Illinois to 1.83 in Massachusetts. Gruber and Köszegi (2001) and Gruber and Zinman (2001) estimated
prenatal smoking participation elasticities of -0.35 for pregnant women and -0.38 for pregnant
teenagers using Natality Detail Files from 1991-1997 and 1989-1996, respectively. Both of these
models use the same data as Evans and Ringel’s earlier work, and a similar specification
identifying the price effect based on changes in excise taxes. Using data from the National
Maternal and Infant Health Survey of 1988 and its 1991 follow-up survey, Bradford (2003) finds
a similar participation elasticity among pregnant women, -0.35. Notably, he finds no significant
difference between pregnant and non-pregnant women in the elasticity of smoking participation.
In related, but not directly comparable work, Colman et al. (2003) explicitly model the quitting
behavior of women smoking at the time of conception. Using the PRAMS database on 10 states
from 1993 to 1999, they estimate a price elasticity of quitting during pregnancy of about -1.0.
Despite a growing body of work in this area, there is no consensus regarding the elasticity
of smoking during pregnancy, and little evidence on how these elasticities vary by the
characteristics of the mothers. This ambiguity in the literature leaves gaps in knowledge about
the potential effectiveness of excise taxes or other price-related policy tools to reduce prenatal
smoking. The MSA provides a useful natural experiment that allows us to test the elasticity of

6

prenatal smoking during a recent time period, and in response to a large national price change.
The MSA allows us to ask, does a large price increase (over 21%) change the smoking behavior
of pregnant women in the late 1990s, and if so, how does the price elasticity of smoking
(participation and intensity) vary by demographic characteristics?

3. Empirical Methods
We examined trends in prenatal smoking before and after the MSA, allowing for changes
in both the level and the trend in prenatal cigarette smoking at the time of the MSA. We estimate
an implied elasticity based on this overall pre-post MSA specification.

The MSA as a Natural Experiment
The MSA created a natural experiment by subjecting the United States’ population to a
sudden, 45 cent per pack increase in cigarette prices. As discussed more fully in Cutler et al.
(2002), the factors leading to the settlement and the subsequent price rise had more to do with the
legal environment and the tobacco companies’ fears of a large award and future litigation than
with a sudden, discrete change in smoking attitudes. To show the abrupt nature of the price
change, Figure 1 presents the average annual retail price of a pack of cigarettes (including excise
taxes and adjusted for inflation to 1999 dollars) from late 1995 to early 2000 (Orzechowski and
Walker, 2003). Monthly retail price data are unavailable, so we also present monthly wholesale
prices (USDA, 2004), (including excise taxes but excluding generic brands) to illustrate the
sharp increase in prices following the November 1998 MSA. The monthly wholesale prices
demonstrate the abrupt price change we use to identify pregnant women’s response to the MSA.
The figure also clearly demonstrates how average retail prices continued to rise in the two years

7

following the MSA. We compare the rate of prenatal smoking and the trend in this rate before
and after the MSA, attributing only the immediate price change (a 45 cent increase in November,
1998) to the MSA since that is the portion of the price change most clearly linked to the
settlement. Assuming that any non-price effects of the MSA really do not affect pregnant
women during our period of study, we will estimate an upper bound for the price response of
pregnant women following the MSA. Our estimate is an upper bound because we attribute
changes in behavior to the immediate 45 cent price change that accompanied the MSA,
excluding the additional rise in cigarette prices that occurred in the subsequent months.

Data and Sample Characteristics
Smoking and demographic data were obtained from the 1996-2000 Natality Detail Files
(NCHS, 1996-2000). These files, generated from birth records, include all births within the
United States during that time period. We restricted the study data to infants conceived between
January 1996 and February 1998 and between December 1998 and February 2000, defining
conception date using reported gestational age. We excluded conceptions between March 1998
and November 1998 because these pregnancies may have been affected by the MSA for only a
portion of their term. We end the study period in February 2000 because infants conceived
beyond this date were mostly born in 2001, and we wished to limit our follow-up to a period
when the price effects of the MSA would be strongest. In addition to the price change, the MSA
stipulated that tobacco companies reduce specific kinds of advertising and allocate a portion of
the settlement monies to a foundation funding anti-tobacco advertising, among other things.
These other policy changes did not take effect immediately and they likely had little impact on
prenatal smoking during our study period (Chaloupka and Warner, 2000; Cutler et al., 2002;

8

American Legacy Foundation, 2004), so we ascribe all observed effects of the MSA to the price
change.
We restricted the sample to singleton births delivered by mothers aged 15-44. Because
California, Indiana, South Dakota, and parts of New York outside of New York City did not
report smoking, we excluded these births (20% of the nation) from our analyses. Records with
incomplete birth weight, smoking, and demographic data were excluded.
Of the 10,029,081 singleton births to women 15-44 years old in our study states and time
period, 9,638,863 (96%) had complete data on the outcomes and covariates of interest. Table 1
shows that most single variables had missing data for fewer than 2% of the observations. Our
sample restrictions resulted in a sample of mothers with slightly better outcomes than the
complete population of pregnant women. The smoking rate among women in our sample was
12.1%, the median birth weight was 3,374g, and the rate of LBW was 6.0% while the smoking
rate in the complete population of pregnant women in 1998 was 12.9% (NCHS, 2003), the
median birth weight was 3,350g, and the rate of LBW was 7.6% (NCHS, 1998). Demographic
characteristics for mothers in the pre-MSA period were very similar to those in the post-MSA
period, though there were slightly more Hispanic mothers and fewer white mothers in the postMSA period (Table 1).

Empirical Specification
We estimated the effect of the MSA on two outcomes – prenatal smoking status and
conditional smoking intensity (smokers’ number of cigarettes smoked per day) – by examining
them before and after November 1998. For smoking status, where the outcome is binary, we
estimated linear probability models so that the model coefficients would be directly interpretable

9

and so that the time trends would be linear on the probability scale. Our large sample size assures
that our data sufficiently approximate the assumptions necessary for ordinary least squares
regression. Estimates using maximum-likelihood logit models (not reported) were qualitatively
and quantitatively similar. We used ordinary least squares models to examine smokers’ number
of cigarettes smoked per day during pregnancy before and after the MSA.
For each outcome, we estimated models of the following form:

Yist = α + β1timet + β 2 PostMSAt + β 3timet * PostMSAt + γExciseTaxes st
′
′
+ ϕMaternal Characteristicsist + δ 1 CalendarMontht + δ 2 States + ε ist .

(1)

To control for secular trends in smoking, the pre-post models included a linear time trend
variable, timet spanning the 50 months of our study period. We tested and rejected higher order
time trends. In each model, the effect of the MSA was assessed using a binary variable,
PostMSAt, equal to 1 for all births conceived after the MSA, to capture changes in the level of
the outcomes, and an interaction between PostMSAt and timet to estimate the change in trend
following the MSA. The vector δ1 includes a set of calendar month effects to control for known
differences in the composition of births at different times of the calendar year, and the vector δ2
includes a set of state fixed effects to control for time-invariant differences in smoking across
states. Our Maternal Characteristics included maternal race, educational attainment, age, parity,
prenatal care, marital status, prior preterm birth, alcohol consumption, and infant gender. Each
was coded categorically as shown in Table 1. Maternal characteristics, including smoking and
alcohol consumption, were self-reported. Race/ethnicity categories were defined by the U.S.
Division of Vital Statistics. Finally, we controlled for state and federal excise taxes
(Orzechowski and Walker, 2003), adjusted for inflation using the Consumer Price Index, urban
consumers series (USDL, 2003). Following several earlier studies, we linked observations in the
Natality Detail Files to cigarette excise taxes specific to the infant’s month of conception and the
10

state where the birth occurred (Evans and Ringel, 1999; Ringel and Evans, 2001; Lien and
Evans, 2004).
For each analysis, we modeled outcomes separately for three mutually exclusive
racial/ethnic groups (non-Hispanic blacks, non-Hispanic whites and Hispanics), two categories
of educational attainment (high school degree or less and greater than a high school degree), and
two age groups (15-19 year olds and 20-44 year olds), as price-responsiveness may vary along
these dimensions (Farrelly and Bray, 1998; Chaloupka and Pacula, 1999; Chaloupka and
Warner, 2000; Ringel and Evans, 2001; USDHHS, 2001). All analyses assumed independence of
observations between, but not within states, and standard errors were adjusted to address
clustering within states, using methods suggested by Huber and White (White, 1980).

4. Trends in Prenatal Smoking Before and After the MSA

Changes in Smoking Prevalence
Before discussing our regression results, we present raw data on prenatal smoking
prevalence during the years before and after the MSA to establish the trends in prenatal smoking
leading up to the MSA. Figure 2 displays annual prenatal smoking rates based on published U.S.
Vital Statistics data from birth certificates (NCHS, 2004). The figure shows a marked, relatively
linear decline in prenatal smoking between 1995 and 2001. This crude look at the data suggests
two things. First, our assumption of a linear trend in smoking rates over our study period
appears reasonable, a fact confirmed more rigorously in our models when higher order time
trends were rejected. Second, there is no discernible break in prenatal smoking trends at the time
of the MSA.

11

Figure 3 displays raw smoking prevalence from our data as well as predictions from the
model of prenatal smoking trends. The dashed line presents the predictions assuming the preMSA trend in prenatal smoking continued unchanged in the period after the MSA. The solid line
presents the model predictions based on the actual data following the MSA. It is clear that the
model fits the data well and that prenatal smoking following the MSA deviated only slightly
from the secular trend established before the MSA.
The left-hand columns in Table 2 give the linear probability model coefficients for the
MSA effects, excise taxes, and the demographic covariates on which we ultimately stratified our
analysis. The probability of smoking during pregnancy declined by about 0.01 percentage points
per month during the period leading up to the MSA, dropped 0.3 percentage points at the time of
the MSA, and then continued to decline with no significant change in trend after the MSA. The
signs on the other coefficients are all as expected. Smoking declines with age for all mothers
over age 20. Smoking is most prevalent among women with some high school education but no
degree, and white women are substantially more likely to smoke than blacks, Hispanics, or
women of other racial and ethnic groups. These trends are similar for the conditional smoking
intensity estimates. Conditional smoking intensity during pregnancy declined by about 0.01
cigarettes/day per month prior to the MSA, dropped another 0.19 cigarettes/day at the time of the
MSA, and declined 0.02 cigarettes/day per month after the MSA.
Table 3 shows how smoking behavior changed in relative terms following the MSA.
Overall and within most groups, the relative decline in smoking was under 3%. Mothers aged
15-19 were the exception to this trend. Their smoking rates declined by 6.32% 8 months after
the MSA, and 8.38% by 15 months after the MSA. These estimates imply an elasticity of
smoking prevalence of about -0.13 overall and -0.30 among teenagers, given the 21% price rise

12

at the time of the MSA. These elasticities are lower than the prior estimates based on cigarette
excise taxes and using similar data from earlier during the 1990s. Table 4 shows analogous
estimates of the relative changes in smoking intensity (among prenatal smokers), and shows
comparable, small effects of the MSA. The relative decline in smoking was at or below 3%
within all groups at both 8 and 15 months following the MSA implying conditional smoking
elasticities of less than -0.14.

Testing the Sensitivity of the Time Trend Assumptions
Because our pre-post analysis lacks a control group, our results rely on the assumption
that the secular time trends we estimated in the period before the MSA would continue after
November 1998 in the absence of the MSA. To address this potential limitation, we tested the
sensitivity of our results to alternative assumptions regarding smoking trends following the
MSA. The results above are robust to alternative assumptions regarding the trend in prenatal
smoking. Because we estimate relatively small effects of the MSA, any understatement of the
secular decline in smoking that would occur absent the MSA would suggest that the true impact
of the MSA was smaller than estimated, or near zero. We tested an alternative scenario, where
the secular trend in smoking reversed near the time of the MSA. In contrast to the estimated
decline in prenatal smoking of 0.12 percentage points per year before the MSA, the true secular
trend in smoking would have to be rising 0.33 percentage points per year following the MSA
before our estimate of the relative change in prenatal smoking reached -7.4%, the minimum
estimate based on national data in the earlier literature. Figure 2 further emphasizes how
dramatic this secular trend would be in light of several years of monotonically declining rates of
prenatal smoking in the years leading up to the MSA.

13

Specification Check to Test the Assumption of Intertemporal Independence
For computational reasons, we assumed that the εist were independent between states and
across time periods. However, we tested first-order autoregressive models for εist using
generalized least squares regression and data aggregated by state and month to gain insight into
how the assumption of intertemporal independence affected our analyses. We modeled the
outcomes as a function of the time and MSA variables and compared auto-regressive and
independence models. We find that, while we reject the independence assumption, the point
estimates for the MSA effects are quite similar in the two models, though the confidence bounds
on the effect of the MSA are 1.3 times wider under the autoregressive assumption.

5. The Effect of Relative Price Changes on Prenatal Smoking

Any standard economic model of consumer demand implies that the relative size of the
price change accompanying the MSA should influence the expected impact of the MSA. The
relative change in cigarette prices following the MSA varied widely across states, ranging from
under 16% in Massachusetts to over 30% in Maryland. We exploit this variation in the relative
price change at the time of the MSA.
We estimate models of the change in prenatal smoking in a given state as a function of
the relative change in cigarette prices due to the MSA and state excise taxes between fiscal year
(FY) 1998 (July 1997 through June 1998) and FY 2000 (July 1999 through June 2000). For
these models, the unit of analysis is the 1998 to 2000 change within a given state. To calculate
the relative price change during this period for each state, we used FY 1998 retail cigarette prices
as the baseline price. Then, for each state, we calculated the total of the change in excise taxes

14

between 1998 and 2000 plus a constant 45 cent MSA effect. We used this total to create the
following modified 2000 price in each state:
′
Price 2000 = Price1998 + ∆(excise taxes) 2000-1998 + 45 cents

(2)

Thus, we are calculating the “plausibly exogenous” price change within a state, assuming that the
MSA price effect and state excise tax changes at this time are exogenous to underlying, within
state trends. Due to the absence of monthly retail price data, we used annual retail prices
(Orzechowski and Walker, 2003) and estimated models of the relative change in the state rate of
prenatal smoking participation and average conditional smoking intensity as a function of
relative price changes. The models take the following form:
⎛ Ys , 2000
ln⎜⎜
⎝ Ys ,1998

′⎞
⎛ Price
⎞
s , 2000 ⎟
⎟ = β1 ln⎜
⎜⎜ Price
⎟ +εs ,
⎟
s ,1998 ⎟
⎠
⎝
⎠

(3)

where s indexes state of birth. In this framework, we would expect β1 to be negative in sign.
That is, for a higher relative price rise, we expect a greater relative decline in smoking. We
weighted each state-level observation by the total number of births in that state in 1998 and 2000
combined.
We plot each state’s relative changes in smoking prevalence and relative price changes in
Figure 4. As seen in the scatter plot, and confirmed in our regression models, the impact of
relative price changes on prenatal smoking prevalence was indistinguishable from 0. In fact, our
estimates of β1 were positive. The coefficient and standard error for β1 in the prevalence models
were 0.3136 and .3302 respectively. The same figures from the conditional smoking intensity
model were 0.1041 and .2630. Given Figure 4 and the large standard errors on our estimates, we
infer that there is no discernible relationship between relative price changes in this set up. If
anything, the positive coefficients may pick up a spurious relationship between changes in state

15

excise taxes and prenatal smoking trends in the underlying state population. This casts doubt on
the usefulness of treating state excise tax changes as exogenous.

6. Conclusions

In a study of over 9 million births before and after the MSA, the effect of the MSA on
prenatal smoking was much smaller than expected. Based on repeated cross-sections of births
during a period before and after the MSA, we estimated a -2.65% change in prenatal smoking 15
months after the MSA. This estimate was less than 40% of the change one might expect given a
price elasticity of prenatal smoking of -0.35, the lowest national estimate reported in earlier
studies (Evans and Ringel, 1999; Gruber and Köszegi, 2001; Gruber and Zinman, 2001; Ringel
and Evans, 2001; Bradford, 2003; Colman et al., 2003; Lien and Evans, 2004). The difference
between the observed change in prenatal smoking and the change implied by earlier estimates is
even more remarkable given that cigarette prices continued to rise dramatically following the
initial 45 cent price hike in November 1998, at least in part due to the MSA.
There are three plausible and potentially concurrent explanations that might reconcile our
results with those in earlier studies. First, the composition of women who smoked during
pregnancy during the time period we study may differ from women who smoked during earlier
years. By 1997, there was wide public awareness of the health risks of smoking and rapidly
rising cigarette prices. Prenatal smoking was falling rapidly in the early 1990’s but the decline
slowed in the years leading up to the MSA. Thus, the women still smoking during pregnancy in
November 1998 may be particularly intransigent. This story is consistent with findings in
Gruber and Köszegi (2001) and Gruber and Zinman (2001), where pregnant women showed less

16

price response than when elasticities estimated using sales data, a measure of tobacco
consumption overall. We think this offers a partial explanation of the results we observe.
A second explanation that reconciles our results with earlier studies is that previous
studies in this area could be confounded by unobserved trends or policy changes within states.
Most studies of the impact of tobacco prices on smoking have focused on changes in state
tobacco excise taxes over time (Evans and Ringel, 1999; Gruber and Köszegi, 2001; Gruber and
Zinman, 2001; Ringel and Evans, 2001; Colman et al., 2003). During certain time periods, excise
tax increases have been endogenous with the environment of a given state. Kubik and Moran
(2003), analyzing cigarette consumption data between 1955 and 1997 find that a state’s tobacco
excise taxes tend to go up in years following increases in the state’s tobacco consumption.
Several other unmeasured state-level changes may have coincided with these tax
increases, so that changes in prenatal smoking that were attributed exclusively to higher cigarette
prices may actually have been caused by multiple factors. For example, legislators may have
implemented tax changes as a response, at least in part, to changing attitudes towards smoking in
their states. Furthermore, there may have been other tobacco control measures, such as
restrictions on smoking in public places, which were implemented at the same time as the tax
increases. Therefore, it is possible that the large price effects estimated in prior studies may be
better attributed to a combination of changes in attitudes, policies, and prices. Indeed, Lien and
Evans (2004) deliberately interpret their results as evidence of a response to all anti-tobacco
policy and not just a price response.
Finally, most of the earlier studies (Evans and Ringel, 1999; Gruber and Köszegi, 2001;
Gruber and Zinman, 2001; Ringel and Evans, 2001; Bradford, 2003; Colman et al., 2003)
analyzed the effects of small changes in state taxes or prices. It may not be appropriate to

17

extrapolate the effects of incremental changes to cases of large price increases. Lien and Evans
(2004) focus their work on larger tax changes in four states, and their elasticity estimates were
highly variable across states, ranging from -0.10 in Illinois to -1.82 in Massachusetts.
At first glance, our findings seem discrepant with national cigarette sales data in the
immediate wake of the MSA. Estimates by Cutler et al. (2002) suggest that national cigarette
sales fell by 6.5% in the year following the MSA, which implies a demand elasticity of -0.33,
within the range of prior elasticity estimates. However, in Figure 5 we present smoking rates for
women of child bearing age, older women, and all men from the National Health Interview
Survey between 1997 and 2000. These data show that at the time of the MSA, 1998-1999,
smoking rates dropped substantially for everyone but women of childbearing age. Both our
estimates and those of Cutler et al. are consistent with the NHIS data in Figure 5.
Although the MSA had a smaller than expected effect on smoking for most pregnant
women, we found the greatest reductions in prenatal smoking following the MSA occurred
among teenage mothers. Preventing smoking initiation among the young is believed by many to
be the most effective way to reduce smoking-related morbidity and mortality in the long term
(USDHHS, 1994; Wechsler et al., 1998; Bauer et al., 2000; Gruber and Zinman, 2001). Even if,
as some suggest, increasing prices delays rather than prevents teen smoking (Glied, 2002), short
term price-induced reductions in teen smoking may have important consequences for birth
weight outcomes.
Our study has several limitations. First, because the post-MSA price increase was
nationwide, no control group was available. However, secular trends in prenatal smoking would
have to have shifted dramatically upwards before our estimate of the relative change in prenatal
smoking 15 months after the MSA reached -7.4%. In addition, we believe the most likely non-

18

price factor concurrent with the MSA that would also have affected smoking is negative
publicity about both smoking and the tobacco industry, a factor which would reduce smoking.
Any non-price factors that decreased tobacco use would suggest that the price effect is even
smaller than what we have estimated.
Second, maternal self-reports of smoking on birth certificates may be inaccurately low
due to social desirability bias. Colman et al. (2003) show that the Natality Detail Files have
lower reported smoking prevalence than the PRAMS database. Even if there were untruthful
reports of prenatal smoking status, our results will not be biased provided such inaccuracies are
not associated with price-responsiveness or time period. We have no reason to believe the
accuracy of self-reported smoking changed substantially between earlier studies using the
Natality Detail Files (Evans and Ringel, 1999; Gruber and Köszegi, 2001; Gruber and Zinman,
2001; Ringel and Evans, 2001; Lien and Evans, 2004) and this study, nor that the accuracy of
self-reported smoking changed during the course of the this study.
Lastly, several states, constituting approximately 20% of births in the United States
population, were excluded. Our findings may not be representative of those populations. Four
percent of the women meeting our selection criteria were excluded because of missing data. As
missingness was similar before and after the MSA for all variables, it is not expected to bias our
results with respect to the impact of the MSA.
In summary, the sharp rise in cigarette prices following the MSA had little effect on
smoking prevalence and intensity among most pregnant women, but the effect was slightly
stronger among pregnant teenagers. The overall modest change in tobacco use in response to a
large change in cigarette prices differs markedly from those implied by earlier estimates of the
price elasticity of smoking among pregnant women. Cigarette taxes are widely viewed as the

19

most effective means of reducing tobacco use, capitalizing on the price-responsiveness of
smokers. The 2000 Surgeon General’s Report states that, relative to other interventions, taxation
both reaches more individuals and has a greater effect (USDHHS, 2000). Policy makers should
be aware that not all populations of smokers, and therefore not all smoking-related illnesses, will
be affected equally by cigarette price increases. Our findings suggest that among pregnant
women, excise taxes are less effective than previously believed.
