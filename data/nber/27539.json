    "abstract": "\n\nThe rapid rise in e-cigarette use rates among high school students in the United States is a significant source of public policy concern for many states. This paper is the first study to examine the impact of state tobacco control spending on the demand for vaping products by high school students. The findings from this study provide strong evidence that funding for state tobacco control programs is associated with reduced vaping among youth and young adults in the US.  These findings could help to inform decision making about how states should allocate scarce public resources.\n\n",
