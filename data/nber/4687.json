We argue that existing approaches to the economics of adjustment take a very narrow view of the role of information.  We outline an approach to this topic that stresses the role of learning and information externalities, and discussed through examples how these concerns alter the qualitative nature of the adjustment process.  In particular, there appears to be a general bias towards the underprovision of information in a variety of settings which leads to inefficient adjustment.\n\n",
