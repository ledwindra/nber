ABSTRACT
This paper makes indirect inference about the time-variation in expected stock returns by comparing
unconditional sample variances to estimates of expected conditional variances. The evidence reveals
more predictability as more information is used, and no evidence that predictability has diminished
in recent years. Semi-strong form evidence suggests that time-variation in expected returns remains
economically important.

Weak and Semi-strong Form Stock Return Predictability Revisited
__________________________________________________________________________________

1. Introduction
The empirical evidence for predictability in common stock returns remains ambiguous, even
after many years of research. This paper makes indirect inference about the time-variation in
expected stock returns by comparing unconditional sample variances of returns to estimates
of expected conditional variances. The key to our approach is a sum-of-squares
decomposition:
Var{R} = E{Var (R Ω)} + Var{E(R Ω)},

(1)

where R is the rate of return of a stock and Ω is the public information set. E(.| Ω ) and
Var(.| Ω ) are the conditional mean and variance and Var{.} and E{.}, without the conditioning
notation, are the unconditional moments. We are interested in the term Var{ E(R| Ω ) }; that
is, the amount of variation through time in conditionally expected stock returns. We infer
this quantity by subtracting estimates of the expected conditional variance from estimates of
the unconditional variance. We focus on the predictability in monthly stock returns. This is
motivated by the empirical literature on asset pricing, which most commonly studies
monthly returns.
We use two approaches to estimate the average conditional variances. These
correspond to the classical description of increasing market information sets described by
Fama (1970). Weak-form information considers only the information contained in past stock
prices. This analysis, summarized in Table 1, builds on a comparison of daily and monthly
sample variances, and is related to the variance ratios studied by Lo and MacKinlay (1988)
and others. For this model we approximate the dynamics of expected returns with a step
functions that changes once per month. Semi-strong form information relates to other lagged

variables that are clearly publicly available. Our analysis uses regressions for individual
stock returns, on lagged firm-specific characteristics. Our approach is unique in that it relies
on the covariation of the predictable components of individual stocks to draw inferences
about index predictability. These results are reported in Table 2.
Studies of predictability in stock index returns typically report regressions with small
R-squares, as the fraction of the variance in returns that can be predicted with lagged
variables is small. The R-squares are larger for longer-horizon returns, because expected
returns are considered to be more persistent than returns themselves.1 However, because
stock returns are very volatile, small R-squares can mask economically important variation in
the expected returns. Stocks are long "duration" assets, so a small change in the expected
return can lead to a large fluctuation in the asset value. To illustrate, consider the simple
Gordon (1962) constant-growth model for a stock price: P = kE/(r-g), where P is the stock
price, E is the earnings per share, k is the dividend payout ratio, g is the future growth rate of
earnings and r is the discount rate. The discount rate is the required or expected return of the
stock. Consider an example where the price/earnings ratio, P/E = 15, the payout ratio, k =
0.6, and the expected growth rate, g = 3%. The expected return is 7%. Suppose there is a
shock to the expected return, ceteris paribus. In this example a change of one percent in r
leads to approximately a 20% change in the asset value.
Of course, it is unrealistic to hold everything else fixed, but the example suggests that
small changes in expected returns can produce large and economically significant changes in
asset values. Consistent with this argument, studies such as Kandel and Stambaugh (1996),
Campbell and Viceira (2001) and Fleming, Kirby and Ostdiek (2001) show that optimal
Thus, the variance of the expected returns accumulates with longer horizons faster than the variance
of returns, and the R-squares increase (see, e.g. Fama and French, 1988, 1989).

portfolio decisions can be affected to an economically significant degree by return
predictability, even when the amount of predictability, as measured by R-squared, is small.
Generalizing the Gordon model to allow for changes in growth rates, Campbell (1991)
estimates that changes in expected returns through time may account for half of the variance
of equity index values.
Our weak-form tests find no reliable evidence of predictability in modern data. Even
so, a simulation study shows that the tests have the power to detect modest amounts of
predictability. On the other hand, our semi-strong form tests find small but statistically and
economically significant predictability. In contrast to recent studies that rely on aggregate
predictor variables, we find no evidence that the predictability has diminished over time.
Section 2 discusses our approaches to measuring the variance of conditional expected
stock returns. Section 3 presents the main results. Section 4 studies the power of our
approach using simulations and the robustness of our empirical findings. Conclusions are
offered in Section 5. Two Appendices discuss data, estimation issues and technical details.

2. Measuring Average Conditional Variances
2.1. Weak Form Information
Equation (1) says that we can estimate the variance of conditional expected stock returns by
first estimating the unconditional variance and then subtracting an estimate of the average
conditional variance. Thus, in order to use Equation (1) we need to estimate the average
variance of the returns around the conditional mean, E{Var(R| Ω )} = E{[R-E(R| Ω )]2}. The
problem is that we don't know the conditional mean, E(R| Ω ). Our approach in this section
follows Merton (1980), who showed that while the mean of a stock return is hard to estimate,
it is nearly irrelevant for estimating the conditional variance, when the time between

4

observations is short. We use high frequency returns to estimate the conditional variance,
subtract its average from the monthly unconditional variance, and the difference -- according
to Equation (1) -- is the variance of the monthly conditional mean.
Nelson (1990, 1992) develops Merton's idea. Ait-Sahalia and Mykland (2003) and
Anderson, Bollerslev and Diebold (2004) discuss extensions. Suppose that the stock value
can be approximated by a continuous process formed as a step function, with time intervals
of length h between the steps. Take the interval [T-h,T), chop it into D pieces, and consider
the average of the D squared log price changes as an estimator for the conditional variance
of the returns over the interval. Nelson proves the estimator is consistent, in the sense that it
approaches the conditional variance in the "continuous record" limit, as h approaches zero
and D becomes infinite. The intuition is that for small h, the conditional mean is effectively
constant, so the sample variance approaches the conditional variance as D grows. By similar
logic, Nelson (1992) shows that misspecification of the conditional mean function washes out
as h gets small.
Evidence from Nelson (1991) supports the idea that for monthly stock returns,
chopping the month into days should work well. He finds that daily returns measured with
versus without dividends, or with versus without a simple adjustment for risk-free interest
rates, produce virtually the same estimates of conditional variances. Similarly, Schwert
(1990) finds that different dividend series have almost no effect on the measured daily
variances of a long historical stock return series that we use in our analysis.
We estimate E{Var(R| Ω )} by the time series average of the daily return variances for
each month. Using monthly returns data, we estimate the unconditional variance, Var(R).
Then, we infer the variance of the conditional expected returns by Equation (1). Let the
return for month m be Rm = ln(Vm/Vm-1) = Σ j∈m ∆ j , where Vm is the value of the stock at time

5

FERSON, HEUSON AND SU
Weak and Semi-strong Form Stock Return Predictability Revisited
__________________________________________________________________________________
m and ∆ j is the daily log value change for day j. Assume that the conditional mean for
month m is µ m = E(Σ j ∆ j j ∈ m), with E(∆j|j ∈ m) = µ m /D, D being the number of days in the
month. Thus, we approximate the dynamics of the conditional mean by a step function. The
unconditional mean monthly return is E( µ m ) = µ , and we are interested in Var( µ m ), the
variance of the monthly expected returns. Define the average daily variance, ADV =
E{E[( ∆ j - µ m /D)2| j∈ m ]}, and the unconditional monthly variance, MV = E{(Rm - µ )2}.
Simple calculations show that Var( µ m ) = MV - D(ADV).

2.2 Serial Dependence
The model uses the approximation that the means shift monthly, while daily returns
fluctuate independently around the conditional means. However, there is weak serial
dependence in daily stock returns. The question is whether or not to attribute this serial
dependence to changes in the conditional expected return.
On the one hand, much of the literature on predictability allows that serial
dependence may reflect changing conditional means. Fama and French (1988) use rate-ofreturn autoregressions to study predictability. Lo and MacKinlay (1988) and Conrad and
Kaul (1988) model expected returns within the month as autoregressive processes. On the
other hand, serial dependence in daily returns can arise from end-of-day price quotes that
fluctuate between bid and ask (Roll, 1984) or from nonsynchronous trading of the stocks in
an index. These effects should not be attributed to time-variation in the expected discount
rate for stocks. We estimate Var( µ m ) with and without adjustments for serial dependence.
To illustrate the adjustment, let θ = E{ E[( ∆ j - µ m /D)( ∆ j′ - µ m /D)| j, j′ ∈ m , |j-j'|=1] }.
Assuming that the first order daily serial dependence reflects market microstructure effects
unrelated to discount rates, we estimate Var( µ m ) = MV - D(ADV + 2 θ ).

__________________________________________________________________________________
2.3 Finite Sample Biases
Biases in the finite sample variances and autocovariances arise due to estimation error in the
sample means. To summarize, the objective is to estimate:

Var( µ m ) = MV - D(ADV + 2θ ),
where

(2)

MV = E{(Rm - µ )2},
ADV = E{E[( ∆ j - µ m /D)2|j ∈ m]}

and

θ = E{ E[( ∆ j - µ m /D)( ∆ j′ - µ m /D)|j,j' ∈ m, |j-j'|=1] }.

The finite sample variances, M̂V and ÂDV , and the monthly average of the daily sample
autocorrelations, have expectations that differ from the true values. Simple calculations
show that

E( M̂V ) = MV - (D/M)(ADV + 2θ),

(3)

E( ÂDV ) = [(D-1)/D] ADV - 2θ /D,
E( θ̂ ) = θ - (ADV + 2θ )/D,

where M is the number of months in the sample. The system (3) provides three equations in
three unknowns, and may be solved for unbiased estimators of MV, ADV and θ. These are
given as:

θ ∗ = {D ÂDV + D(D-1) θ̂ }/{(D-1)(D-2) - 2},

(4)

ADV ∗ = {2D θ̂ + D(D-2) ÂDV }/{(D-1)(D-2) - 2},
MV ∗ = M̂V + (D/M) ADV ∗ + (2D/M) θ ∗ .

7

FERSON, HEUSON AND SU
Weak and Semi-strong Form Stock Return Predictability Revisited
__________________________________________________________________________________
Using these estimators, we form the unbiased estimator of the variance of the monthly
expected returns as:

Var (µ m ) ∗ = MV ∗ - D( ADV ∗ + 2θ ∗ ).

(5)

In addition to the finite sample bias addressed above, there is a "finite record" bias,
which arises because h>0 and D<∞. To address these biases we use Monte Carlo simulations.
The calculations described above do not impose the requirement that variance estimates
can't be negative. The Appendix B describes how this restriction is imposed. The restricted
estimates involve numerical solution of a system of Kuhn-Tucker conditions. When a single
parameter is involved, the solution sets the estimate to zero when the unrestricted variance
estimate is negative. Section 4 further explores the power and robustness of the methods.

2.4. Semi-strong Form Information: Using Individual Stock Regressions
Much of the empirical literature on asset-return predictability uses regressions of stock-index
returns on lagged, market-wide information variables. This approach raises two types of
concerns. First, there are statistical problems associated with the regressions, especially when
the data are heteroskedastic, the right-hand side variables are highly persistent or the lefthand side returns are overlapping in time.2 The second issue is data mining. If the lagged
variables arise from many researchers sifting through the same data sets, there is a risk of
finding spurious predictability (Lo and MacKinlay 1990; Foster, Smith and Whaley 1997).
We use individual stocks to estimate the sum-of-squares decomposition in Equation
Boudoukh and Richardson (1994) provide an overview of the statistical issues. Stambaugh (1999) and
Ferson, Sarkissian and Simin (2003) provide more recent analyses and references.

(1), focusing on the aggregate predictability. Basic portfolio theory implies that individualstock expected returns teach us about index predictability, only to the extent that they are
correlated across the stocks. Consider the N x N covariance matrix of the conditional mean
returns for N stocks, Cov{E(R|Z)}, where Z stands for the lagged, public information
regressors. Letting 1 be an N-vector of ones, the variance of the conditional expected returns
on an equally-weighted portfolio, Rp is:

Var{E(Rp|Z)} = (1/N2) 1'Cov{E(R|Z)}1.

(6)

Since there are N(N-1) covariance terms, but only N variances in this expression, the expected
return variance for the portfolio approaches the average of the firms' expected return
covariances, while the individual stock predictability vanishes as N gets large.
To estimate the predictability of the index we model Cov{E(R|Z)} from individualstock regressions on lagged, firm-specific variables. We use Monte Carlo methods to handle
the statistical issues, as described in Appendix B. There is some correlation between our
firm-specific variables and the instruments selected in previous studies of aggregate
predictability, so we are not completely immune to data mining bias. However, our measure
does not rely on the direct index predictability that so many previous studies have explored,
and the number of studies that examine individual-stock return predictability with timeseries regressions is still relatively small. Using only firm-specific instruments we probably
understate the correlations among the expected returns. If we use market-wide instruments
for individual stocks, we are likely to overstate the correlations. Comparing the two cases we
estimate a range of plausible values.

3. Empirical Results
3.1. Results using Weak-form Information
Table 1 presents estimates of predictability based on the comparison of monthly and daily
return variances. Appendix A describes the data. Panel A presents results for the Standard
and Poor's index over different subsamples and Panel B summarizes the results for the
individual common stocks of twenty six large firms. Three estimators of predictability are
shown. The estimator denoted as σ(µ m ) includes no adjustment for daily serial dependence,
while the estimator σ(µ m ) ∗ adjusts for any first order autocorrelation, taking the view that
daily serial correlation reflects microstructure issues unrelated to changes in discount rates.
The estimator σ(µ m ) # takes the view that -- for individual stocks -- the main microstructure
effect is the bid-ask bounce, which produces negative autocorrelation. Thus, negative
autocorrelations are removed each month from the predictability calculation while no
adjustment is made for positive ones. The average autocorrelation parameter, θ , is positive
for the Standard and Poor's 500 index, and negative for 16 of the 26 firms. For comparison,
the second column contains the unconditional standard deviations of the monthly returns,
expressed as annual percentages.3
We first discuss the estimates in columns 3-5, labeled GMM estimates. These are the
three estimates with analytical adjustments for finite sample biases. The estimates of
predictability for the stock index range from 1.9% to 5.4% using Schwert's (1990) data for the
1885-1962 period. Over the 1962-2001 period where the CRSP daily data are available, the
estimated volatility of the expected returns is 2%. After adjusting for positive serial
dependence, which may arise from nonsynchronous trading of the stocks in the index, the
The monthly variance is multiplied by 12, then the square root of this result is multiplied by 100. All
of the numbers in the tables are annualized this way.

estimator σ(µ m ) ∗ delivers a value of zero. Over the most recent 120 months of the sample all
of the estimates of predictability are zero.
We estimate the finite sample biases in the predictability estimates using simulations.
The simulations also provide empirical p-values for assessing the statistical significance of
the results.4 The adjusted estimates are shown in columns 6-8 of Table 1. They tell a similar
story. The estimates for the index range from zero to 5.1% for the 1885-1962 period, and the
larger figures appear statistically significant. However, using the CRSP data for 1962-2001,
the estimates are 1.44% or less, and none are statistically significant. Over the last 120 months
the adjusted estimates are all equal to zero.
Panel B summarizes results for a sample of 26 large firms' individual common stocks.
These cover the post-1962 period where the CRSP daily data are available. Averaged across
the stocks, the predictability estimates range from zero to 2.2%, depending on the choice of
estimator and sample period. The empirical p-values range from 0.23 to 0.35, thus providing
no evidence of predictability. Even the extreme cases present no reliable evidence of
predictability. Taking the stock with the maximum value of σ(µ m ) , its empirical p-value is
0.07 or 0.08, depending on the subperiod. Accounting for the fact that this is the maximum of
26 cases, the results are insignificant.5
We resample from the actual data for a given stock or index, randomly with replacement. For each
simulation trial we generate an artificial time series with the same number of daily observations as the
original data series. The artificial data satisfy the null hypothesis that the expected return is constant. We
compute the estimators on the artificial sample in exactly the same way as on the original samples. We
repeat this for 1,000 trials. The average across the trials is the expected finite sample bias. We use the
distribution of the simulated estimates to generate empirical p-values. These are the fraction of the
simulations where the variance estimates are larger than the sample values. A small p-value means that
the sample estimate is unlikely to occur if expected returns are constant.

Let ui be the empirical p-value for the i-th experiment, i=1,...,n. Under the null hypothesis of no
predictability the empirical p-value is uniformly distributed on [0,1]. Assuming independent
experiments,

__________________________________________________________________________________
In summary, while the older historical data suggests economically significant
predictability in the market index, there is little evidence of weak-form predictability in
modern data. In particular, the evidence for the most recent ten years suggests that any
weak-form predictability in the index has vanished.6

3.2. Semi-Strong Form Tests
Table 2 presents our estimates of predictability for an equally-weighted portfolio,
based on the covariances of individual stock regressions on lagged variables. The regressions
use monthly data from 1969 through 2001 and twenty large firms' common stocks. The data
are described in Appendix A. The three rows for each sample period contain sample values
of the implied predictability using either all the elements of the covariance matrix of the fitted
expected returns, the off-diagonal elements only, or the diagonal elements only. The
different cases are averaged according to the number of covariance elements involved. The
“all elements” variances are the sum of the elements divided by N2. The “off-diagonal”
variances are the sum of the off-diagonal terms divided by N(N-1). The “Diagonal only”
variances are the mean of the individual regression fitted variances. Thus, the all-elements

Prob{Mini ui ≤ q}

= 1 - Prob{ui>q; i=1,...,n}
= 1 - Π i Prob{ui>q}
= 1 - (1-q)n.

For q=0.07 and n=26, the probability of finding the minimum p-value to be 0.07 or smaller in 26 trials is
85%. Of course, the trials are not independent, so the correct probability is somewhere between 7% and
85%.
6 Lo and MacKinlay (1999) present weak form tests with less evidence for predictability in more recent
data, and suggest that the demise of such predictability may be related to "statistical arbitrage" trading by
Wall Street firms. Nelson and Kim (1993) also find that weak-form evidence for stock index predictability
is thin in post World War II data.

12

FERSON, HEUSON AND SU

__________________________________________________________________________________
variance is a weighted average of the off-diagonal and diagonal-only variances, weighted
according to the number of elements involved. The examples with diagonals only are
unrealistic because they ignore the covariance across stocks, but they isolated the individualstock predictability. That is, they show how the average stock would behave if it were
treated like the index.
The estimates excluding the diagonals provide information on what would be
expected to happen as the number of similar stocks in the portfolio becomes large. In this
case using firm-specific regressors, the first column of figures shows that the implied
predictability estimates fall in a narrow range, from 2.37% to 2.67%, depending on the
subperiod.
The regressions behind Table 2 are subject to statistical biases, which we control via
simulation as discussed in Appendix B. The bias-adjusted estimates are summarized in the
second column of figures. Using only the off-diagonal terms, the average values are 1.63% to
1.84% annualized. Using the full covariance the estimates are 2.41% to 2.59%. These are
statistically significant according to the empirical p-values.
The measures of predictability based on the diagonals only are summarized in the
third row. The average diagonal elements are numerically larger than the average offdiagonal terms, but not significantly different from zero. Their right-tail p-values are larger
than 20% in each experiment. This reflects the relatively large sampling variability of the
regression estimates of expected returns, compared with their relatively small sampling
covariability. This is one of the advantages of our approach, compared with previous studies
that rely on direct regressions of stock indexes on lagged variables. Because the sampling
covariability of the expected returns with firm-specific lagged variables is relatively small, we
are able to estimate the predictability with relatively high precision. Thus, based on the

13

FERSON, HEUSON AND SU
Weak and Semi-strong Form Stock Return Predictability Revisited
__________________________________________________________________________________
covariability, we can say that 1.8% to 2.6% is strongly statistically significant.
The estimates of predictability in Table 2 emphasizing the off diagonals, are similar
whether we use the full sample or concentrate on subsamples of the last 120 months or the
most recent 60 months.7 This is interesting in view of recent empirical studies that find index
predictability, measured directly using lagged variables, has weakened in recent samples. It
may be that the predictability was "real" when first publicized, but diminished as traders
attempted to exploit it.8 Alternatively, the predictability may have been spurious in the first
place, as a result of statistical biases and/or naive data mining. If the predictability is
spurious we would expect lagged instruments to appear in the empirical literature, then fail
to work with fresh data (e.g., Ferson, Sarkissian and Simin, 2003). But Table 2 presents no
evidence that predictability is weaker in the recent subperiods.
As our firm-instrument-only measures do not rely on aggregate predictor variables,
Table 2 provides new and interesting evidence that the underlying predictability has not
diminished. This is consistent with the "efficient markets' view of predictability, as reflected
in much of the conditional asset pricing literature (see reviews by Ferson (1985) and
Cochrane, 2001). According to this view returns may be predictable if required expected
returns vary over time in association with changing risk or risk aversion. If required
expected returns vary over time there may be no abnormal trading profits and thus, no
incentive to exploit the predictability. Predictability may therefore persist in an efficient
market.

7 In additional experiments not reported in the table we include an additional lagged predictor, a
measure of the firm's dividend yield. The results with this additional regressor (which is not available for
all of the firms) are very similar to those in the table.

See Schwert (2003) for a review of this evidence and Goyal and Welch (2003) for a recent analysis.

FERSON, HEUSON AND SU
Weak and Semi-strong Form Stock Return Predictability Revisited
__________________________________________________________________________________
The two right-hand columns of Table 2 show predictability estimates when each
regression uses both firm-specific and market index ("Macro") characteristics as the lagged
regressors, or alternatively, when only the Macro variables are used. These calculations show
the effects of using the economy-wide lagged regressors. The estimated standard deviations
of the monthly expected returns for the full sample period are between 4.2% and 8.6%,
depending on whether or not we exclude the diagonals from the calculation. The economywide regressors increase the covariability of the expected return estimates. The "Macro only"
examples in the far right column suggest that predictability is diminished somewhat in the
more recent subperiods, which is consistent with the evidence cited earlier in studies that rely
on economy-wide regressors.
Our semi-strong form estimates of predictability provide more reliable evidence of
time-variation in monthly stock returns than our weak-form tests. This is expected if returns
are more easily predicted using more information. But is 2-3% on an annual basis an
economically significant effect? The simple Gordon model example from the introduction
provides an illustration. Consider a month in which the required expected return jumps by
roughly two standard deviations, say from 7% to 11%. Other things held fixed, the stock
price would fall to half of its former value in response. Of course this overstates the effect, to
the extent that a shock that changes the required return also changes the expected cash flows
and future growth rates, but the example suggests the economic significance of predictability.

4. Power and Robustness
This section presents some results on the statistical power of our methods and on the
robustness of our empirical findings. Concerns about power focus on the weak-form tests
where we do not find significant predictability. Our approach contains several steps where

15

FERSON, HEUSON AND SU
Weak and Semi-strong Form Stock Return Predictability Revisited
__________________________________________________________________________________
approximations are introduced or estimation is required. Each step is prone to some error,
and the cumulative effect of the errors may result in low power. To evaluate the power we
use simulations that include each of the steps. We also compare various estimators to isolate
the impact of the different steps on power.
In the simulations we generate data following the model described in Section 2.1.
The conditional means fluctuate each month as draws from a normal distribution, whose
standard deviation controls the amount of variation in the expected returns. Daily returns
fluctuate randomly around the monthly means, with variances chosen so that the first and
second moments of the simulated returns match the sample returns. By setting the expected
return variation to equal zero, we get critical values for a 5% test, defined such that 5% of the
simulations produce statistics larger than the critical value. Setting the expected return
variation to larger values, we trace out the power curves illustrated in Figures 1 and 2. The
power of a particular test is the fraction of the simulation trials that produce a statistic larger
than the critical value, given that an alternative hypothesis with time-variation in the
expected returns generates the data. Figure 1 takes the variances of expected returns as the
statistics. Figure 2 takes the empirical p-values of the expected return variances as the test
statistics. The approach is the same, except that, because the empirical p-value is the result of
a simulation, we now have to conduct simulations within the simulations.
Various estimators are displayed in figures 1 and 2. Auto is the sample
autocorrelation statistic, and the others are the implied expected return estimators with
various adjustments. We use the sample autocorrelation statistic as a "straw man" for
comparison, because most of the statistics used in the literature on weak-form predictability
are transformations of the sample autocorrelation (see, e.g. Cochrane, 1991). Of course, we
expect the sample autocorrelation to perform poorly under our model of the return

16

dynamics, and the simulations bear this out. The power of the autocorrelation is nearly level
at about 5%, independent of the amount of expected return variation. The estimator ABB
refers to analytical and bootstrap bias adjustments, ABMB refers to analytical bias,
microstructure bias and bootstrap adjustments. ABMNB refers to analytical bias,
microstructure bias for negative autocorrelations only and bootstrap adjustments. Boot has
only bootstrap bias adjustments and Unadj. refers to the estimators with no bias adjustments.
The differences between the power of these estimators parse out the separate effects on
power of the various steps in our estimation strategy. The figures show that the most
complicated procedure, ABMB suffers lower power in some parts of the curve, but otherwise
the various estimators give similar results.
Figures 1 and 2 suggest that our weak form tests have the power to detect modest
amounts of predictability. For example, if the annual standard deviation of the expected
returns is 3%, the power of the various statistics is 14% to 19%. Using 15% as the annual
standard deviation of the monthly index returns, an expected return standard deviation of
3% means that a regression of the return on its expected return would produce an R-squared
of only (0.03/0.15)2=4%. That is, the expected returns account for only 4% of the variance of
the returns. With an annual standard deviation of 5%, the R-squared would be about 11%,
which is similar to the values reported in some stock return regression studies. At this level
the power of our tests is near 60%. At a standard deviation of 6% or more for the expected
returns, the power of our tests is 80% or higher.
In tables 3 and 4 we explore the robustness of our empirical results. One of the
questions to be further addressed relates to the treatment of the autocorrelations of daily
returns. Panel A of Table 3 presents results for the Standard and Poor's index, replacing the
stock index with index futures prices. Following Boudoukh et al. (1993) and Blume,

17

FERSON, HEUSON AND SU

__________________________________________________________________________________
MacKinlay and Terker (1989), there should be no issues with microstructure-related
autocorrelation in the index futures returns. The daily index futures are available from June
of 1982 through September of 2002. The table shows that our main results are robust to the
use of futures over this period, and over the more recent ten-year subsample. All of the point
estimates of weak-form predictability are zero.
We use large firms' common stocks in the main experiments of tables 1 and 2,
because such stocks should be representative of the market. However, small firms' stocks
may have more serial correlation related to market microstructure effects. Small-firm stocks
may also display more predictability related to market inefficiencies, as it is more costly to
trade the stocks of smaller companies to exploit inefficiencies.
Panel B of Table 3 repeats the tests of Table 1, using 26 small-firm stocks in place of
the large-firm stocks. The returns data are available from January of 1980 through September
of 2002. The panel shows that the average weak-form predictability estimates and the point
estimates for some of the small firms are somewhat higher than we found for the large firm
stocks. The average bias-adjusted estimates are 0.25% to 1.35% over the full sample, and
1.25% to 1.32% for the most recent decade, depending on the estimator. The standard
deviations of the monthly returns are also markedly higher for smaller firms. Thus, the
average predictability estimate of 1.35% corresponds to only (.0135/.305)2 = 0.2% of the
variance explained by the expected return. Given this low signal-to-noise ratio, the average
right-tail p-values are all above 25%. The maximum values across the 26 firms seem more
impressive; for example, bias-adjusted predictability values of 16-17% are found for one firm
in the most recent decade. However, accounting for the multiple comparisons, the chances of
finding numbers this large are as high as 7.5% to 18.8%.9
9

Following footnote 5, 1-(1-0.008)26=18.8% and 1-(1-0.003)26=7.5%.

__________________________________________________________________________________
Table 4 presents the results of repeating the analysis of Table 2 using our sample of
small firm stocks. For comparability with Table 2, the first twenty stocks are used. The
available sample covers the 1981-2001 period. The results are very similar to those of Table 2.
Using firm-specific lagged predictor variables the bias-adjusted estimates of semi-strong
form predictability are between 1.78% and 3.62%, depending on how the diagonal elements
of the expected return covariance matrix are treated. The diagonal elements on average,
imply more predictability than the off-diagonal elements, as we saw before, but the
covariability is somewhat lower among the small stocks. With the lower sampling
covariability, the diagonal-only estimates of predictability become statistically significant.
Again, there is no evidence that semi-strong form predictability has diminished in the most
recent decade.

5. Conclusions
Small changes in expected returns can produce large and economically significant
changes in asset values. This paper presents new estimates of time-variation in the expected
returns of stocks, using indirect methods. Weak-form tests find no reliable evidence of
predictability in modern data. Semi-strong form tests find small but economically significant
predictability. In contrast to recent studies that rely on aggregate predictor variables, we find
no evidence that the predictability has diminished in recent samples.

Appendix A: Semi-strong Variables
Our semi-strong form tests use data on lagged, firm-specific instruments and economy-wide,
macro instruments for the index. The firm-specific instruments are obtained from CRSP and
COMPUSTAT. They include for each stock month, (1) the average return over the previous
twelve months; (2), the book-to-market ratio, defined as the most recently-available book
value per share (quarterly Compustat data item #60 divided by item #61) divided by the onemonth-lagged price per share; and (3) the earnings-to-price ratio, defined as the trailing four
quarters' earnings (Compustat data item #11) divided by the one-month lagged stock price.
The stock prices and returns are from CRSP.
The macro instruments include: (1) the lagged three-month Treasury Bill secondary
market yield; (2) the lagged, one-month holding period return on a three-month Treasury
Bill; (3) the spread between the Treasury Bill yield and the ten-year constant maturity
Treasury Bond yield to maturity; and (4) the spread between Moody's Seasoned AAA and
BAA corporate bond yields. All of the yield series are measured as the lagged monthly
average of daily values, from the Federal Reserve. In addition, we use the one-month and
twelve-month lagged holding period return on the Standard and Poor's Index, excluding
dividends, from CRSP. We also use the dividend yield on the SPX index. The dividend yield
is computed as the trailing 12-month dividends divided by the SPX index level. Monthly
dividends are obtained from Bloomberg.

Appendix B: Estimation Issues
B.1 Imposing Positivity
Boudoukh, Richardson and Smith (1993) describe estimators for risk premiums, imposing the
restriction that the expected risk premium is positive. Their tests involve the minimization of
a quadratic form in the restricted and unrestricted estimates, which we adapt to the current
setting as follows. Let φ̂ be an N-vector of unrestricted estimates of Var( µ m ) for N assets,
whose sample values may be negative. Consider the estimator

φ ∗ = Arg Minφ ( φ − φˆ )'Cov( φ̂ )-1( φ − φˆ ) subject to φ ≥0,

(B.1)

where the inequality in the constraint applies element-by-element. The Kuhn-Tucker
conditions for this problem specify φ ∗ and an N-vector of multipliers U = {ui}i, which satisfy

( φ ∗ − φˆ )' Cov( φ̂ )-1 - U = 0,

(B.2)

∗

φ i u i = 0, i=1,...,N,
∗

φ i ≥ 0, i=1,...,N, and
ui ≥ 0, i=1,...,N.

We solve the system (B.2) numerically to obtain the restricted estimators, φ ∗ . Note that when
∗

N=1 this amounts to setting φ i = 0 whenever the unrestricted value is negative.

B.2 Semi-strong Form Estimates
In our semi-strong form analysis, we use simulations based on a parametric form of the
bootstrap to control statistical biases in the predictive regressions. The following regression

21

FERSON, HEUSON AND SU
Weak and Semi-strong Form Stock Return Predictability Revisited
__________________________________________________________________________________
system is estimated for each asset:
Rt+1 = µ + ∈t +1

(B.3)

Zt+1 = µ z + A (Zt - µ z ) + vt+1,

where A is an L x L matrix and there are L instruments in Z. The sample means estimate µ
and µ z , and the OLS coefficient estimates A. These estimates are taken as parameters of the
simulation. Then, we resample from the vector of residuals { ∈t +1 , v t +1 }, randomly with
replacement, and use these as the shocks in the simulation. We build up the time series of Zt
recursively in each simulated sample, along with the contemporaneous returns, which satisfy
the null hypothesis of constant expected returns, µ . This approach preserves the first order
autocorrelation of the instruments and accommodates the finite sample bias discussed by
Stambaugh (1999), which arises when ∈t +1 and v t +1 are correlated. We regress Rt+1 on Zt, using
the simulated data samples, for each of the 1,000 simulation trials, and estimate the
predictability exactly as in the original data. Since the covariance of the expected returns is
zero, the true predictability is zero in the simulations. The average measured predictability,
taken across the simulation trials, is our estimate of the bias, and the fraction of the
simulations in which the actual data estimate exceeds the simulated value, is the empirical pvalue.

Table 1
Return Predictability Based on Weak-Form Information
The predictability measures are the standard deviation of the expected returns, in percent per month, on
an annualized basis.* The measures compare monthly unconditional return variances with average
conditional variances, estimated from daily data. Panel A presents results for the Standard and Poor's
stock index return over different subperiods. Panel B contains similar statistics for a sample of twenty
six large firms' individual common stocks. For individual stocks the average statistics (Avg) are shown,
along with the cases that produce the largest (Max) and smallest (Min) estimate of expected return
variation. The columns present different estimators, and the monthly return standard deviations are
included for comparison. The estimator σ (µm) is the annualized standard deviation of the monthly
expected returns, in percent. The estimator σ (µm)* is adjusted to remove the effects of all first order
serial dependence in daily returns. The estimator σ (µm)# is adjusted to remove only the effects of
negative first order serial dependence. The GMM estimates are found using the Generalized Method of
Moments. The Finite Sample Adjusted estimates subtract a bootstrapped estimate of finite sample bias,
under the null hypothesis of independent and identically distributed returns. Right-tail empirical pvalues are on the second line of each case with bootstrapped finite sample adjustments.

Table 2
Semi-strong Form Predictability
The implied predictability is the annualized standard deviation of the time-varying monthly
expected returns, in percent, for an equally-weighted portfolio of 20 large common stocks. The
figures are estimated from the covariance matrix of the individual stock regressions. The rows
report alternative calculations where either all of the elements of the covariance matrix are used, or
when the diagonal and off-diagonal elements are emphasized. The “All Elements” variance is a
weighted average of the “off-diagonal” and the “Diagonal only” variance, weighted by the number
of covariances involved. The columns report experiments where different predictor variables are
in the regressions: Either firm-specific variables only, firm-specific and Macro variables, or Macro
variables only. The Bias-adjusted estimates subtract a bootstrapped estimate of finite sample bias,
under the null hypothesis of constant expected returns. Empirical right-tail p-values for this
estimate are denoted as p-value.
