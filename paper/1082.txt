Asset Substitutability and the Impact of Federal Deficits
ABSTRACT

In

this paper, the role of asset substitutability in deter-

mining the impact of debt—financed federal deficits is examined. The
issues are first discussed in the context of a simple analytical model
in which financial assets are disaggregated into money, federal debt,

and corporate bonds. In this model, it is shown that depending on the
degree of substitutability among financial assets, a range of possible
outcomes associated with a change in the federal deficit is possible.

Next, the issue of asset substitutability is examined empirically in a
disaggregated structural model of the Treasury security, corporate

bond, and equity markets. Using this model, the implications of
larger debt—financed federal deficits are then examined in a series
of simulation experiments.

ASSET SUBSTITUTABILITY AND THE I1'WACT OF FEDERAL DEFICITS

V. Vance Roley*
Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City
The large federal deficits since 1975, and the prospect of
their further rapid expansion through the mid—1980s, have caused
greater attention to be focused on the economic consequences of

federal deficits. Much of the discussion has centered on the issue
of whether a rise in the deficit crowds out interest—sensitive

private spending. This discussion is properly directed, as a vast
majority of deficits since the late 1960s have been debt financed.
In particular, while marketable Treasury securities net of Federal
Reserve holdings actually declined during the 1964—69 period, private
investors have purchased about 85 percent of the cumulative rise in

federal debt since 1969. Moreover, during 1980 and 1981, private
investors purchased over 90 percent of the rise in outstanding federal
debt .-'

Any of several Conditions have been shown to imply situations
in which a debt—financed increase in the federal deficit due to a
rise in government expenditures crowds out an equal amount of private

expenditures, even in the short run.- One unambiguous case emerges
when all factors of production are

already fully employed [e.g., M.

Friedman (1970)]. However, even in the presence of unemployed
resources, if households view the tax liability associated with an
increase in federal debt as being equal to the value of the debt, then
debt—financed increases in government spending would again crowd out
private spending [e.g., Bailey (1971), Barro (1974), and Kochin

(1974)]. That is, if the Ricardian equivalence theorem holds,

—2—
systematic fiscal policy cannot affect aggregate demand.-"
In the absence of full employment and Ricardian equivalence,
Tobin (1961,1963) and subsequent writers have noted that the extent of
short—run crowding out depends on the substitutability among assets.
If federal debt and private capital are perfect substitutes, for
example, complete crowding out is again possible if the demand for

money depends on wealth [e.g., Silber (1970) and Meyer (1975)]. However, if money and federal debt are perfect substitutes, a debt—

financed increase in the deficit causes total spending to rise. Allowing imperfect substitutability among money, federal debt, and
capital, the possible outcomes span these extremes and therefore
range from crowding out to crowding in [e.g., B. Friedman ([1978)].
Moreover, even if federal debt and capital are perfect substitutes,
Blinder and Solow (1973) have demonstrated that bond—financed deficits
may be more stimulative than those that are money—financed in the

long run.1
The purpose of this paper is to examine empirically the role
asset substitutability plays in determining the impact of federal

deficits on interest rates and capital formation. In the first section, the issues are examined in a simple analytical model including

three assets: money, federal debt, and corporate bonds. Following
B. Friedman (1978), the impact of federal deficits is shown to depend
primarily on the relative magnitudes of the interest—rate coefficients

in the aggregate demands for these three assets. The empirical model
used to evaluate asset substitutability is presented in the second

section. The model consists of estimated demands for corporate bonds,
equities, and four different maturity classes of Treasury securities

—3—

by 11 disaggregated investor categories. In the third section, the
short—run impact of deficits on interest rates is estimated using
simulations in which the supply of each of the four maturity classes
of Treasury securities is separately increased in each period. The
dynamic effects of deficit shocks are then calculated in this partial

equilibrium framework. The general equilibrium effects of deficits on
both interest rates and capital formation are considered in the fourth

section. These general equilibrium effects are obtained from the
model developed by B. Friedman (1981,1982), which in turn is comprised
of the disaggregated asset demands estimated by Roley (1980,1982) com-

bined with the MIT—PENN—SSRC (MPS) model. The main conclusions of
this paper are summarized in the final section.

ISSUES IN A SILE ANALYTICAL MODEL
In this section, a basic analytical model is presented to consider the role of asset substitutability in

determining the impact of

a change in the federal deficit on interest rates.- Two permutations
of this simple model are also considered.

First, the corporate

financing decision is endogenized to examine whether

substitutability

between financing alternatives moderates the impact of deficits on

interest rates. Second, similar effects are investigated in the context of financial intermediation. Although the empirical results
reported in later sections are obtained from a disaggregated structural
model comprised of 51 behavioral equations, the empirical model in its
aggregated form is similar to the illustrative models analyzed here.
In each of the models presented below, only the financial effects
of an increase in the federal deficit are considered.

Thus, income is

—4—

exogenous and the financial effects examined are analogous to shifts

in the LM curve in traditional IS—LN analysis. Using B. Friedman's
(1978) terminology, such shifts in the LM curve determine the amount
of "portfolio crowding out," which is separate from the amount of

"transactions crowding out." This latter effect corresponds to the
movement along a given LM curve associated with shifts in the IS

curve. As long as the LM curve has a positive slope, some transactions

crowding out—and a subsequent rise in interest rates—will occur in
response to stimulative fiscal actions. However, if the LM curve is
not vertical, transactions crowding out cannot be of sufficient magni-

tude to inhibit altogether a rise in total spending. Thus, the question of whether crowding out is complete depends also on the sign and

magnitude of the portfolio crowding out effect considered below. Moreover, depending on the substitutability among assets, some portion of
transactions crowding out could actually be offset resulting in an
unambiguous rise in total spending with perhaps only a trivial rise in
interest rates.

To investigate these questions, the first model considered is
comprised of the aggregate demands for money (Nd), federal debt (Td),
and corporate bonds (Bd):

Throughout this section, it is assumed that own—yield and wealth
elasticities of demand are nonnegative such that ..>O,
(i=t,b), and that assets are not gross complements

ij,

(i,j=m,t,b)].1 The Brainard—Tobjn (1968) portfolio balance conditions place further restrictions on the coefficients, and they may be
represented as

this model, the interest—bearing securities are assumed to have

variable coupons and fixed market values, and businesses are assumed

to finance all capital accumulation with bonds. It is also assumed
that the cumulative supply of bonds CBS) equals the value of the

capital stock, K. Thus, total wealth has the usual representation

W=M+T+K.

(2)

Combining the aggregate demands (1) with fixed supplies of money

(N°) Treasury securities (T°), and capital (KO=BS), the model determines two endogenous yields, r and rb. Because of its presumed

effect on business investment decisions and hence total spending, the
impact of bond—financed deficits on the corporate bond rate is

examined here. That is, the corporate bond rate is taken as the relevant rate for the IS curve.

—6—

Following Christ (1968), Silber (1970), and Meyer (1975), any
increases in government expenditures (G) or decreases in taxes (R) are
related to increases in federal debt and outside money through the
government budget constraint

dG—dR=dT+dM.

(3)

In the case of a bond—financed increase in the deficit, dM=0 and
dT=dW>0, the impact on the corporate bond rate may be expressed as

3T

tbt - btt
ttbb - tb8bt

where the denominator is positive if all assets are gross substitutes.
Thus, the presence of portfolio crowding out or crowding in depends on

the numerator. In turn, the sign and magnitude of the numerator
depends on the degree of asset substitutability and the effect of
wealth on the individual demands.

With the above assumptions, it can be shown that if wealth does

not affect money demand (y=O), then a rise in the deficit unambiguously reduces the corporate bond rate and therefore leads to crowding

in. In this case, the wealth effects on the demands for interest—
bearing securities more than offset the impact of the rise in the

supply of Treasury securities. Alternatively, if the demands for
Treasury securities and corporate bonds are not functions of wealth

abond—financed increase in the deficit unambiguously leads to
crowding out. Interest rates must rise in this case to offset the
increased demand for money due to the rise in wealth.

The interest—rate coefficients in the demands—which relate
directly to asset substitutability—are equally important in determining the impact of larger deficits on the corporate bond rate. As

—7—

others have previously noted, if money and Treasury securities are

close substitutes, implying that bt is near zero, then bond—financed
increases in the deficit cause the corporate bond yield to fall.

Alternatively, if Treasury securities and corporate bonds are close

substitutes, leading to a value of bt near

crowding out is the

result.ZI For asset substitutability between these extremes, the outcome could be either crowding out or crowding in.

Corporate Financing Decision

In the model examined above, businesses are assumed to finance

capital accumulation solely by selling bonds. This assumption is now
relaxed in perhaps the simplest manner by allowing corporations to
either sell bonds or reduce their money holdings to finance investment

spending. As is shown below, the extent of crowding out or crowding
in is reduced if corporations view alternative funding sources as substitutes.

In this extended model, corporations are assumed to demand money

and supply bonds according to

Implicit in equation (6) is the constraint KBS_Mc. The aggregate
demands for assets by households (1) are assumed to remain unchanged,

—8—

but equilibrium in the money market is now described by the market—
clearing identity

Nd + Mc = N°.
Combining equations (1) and (5), the impact of a bond—financed
increase in the deficit on the corporate bond rate may be determined

as before. In this case, it may be shown that the impact is

rb

—

tbt'bStt

(7)

Under the reasOnable assumption that the supply of bonds is negatively
related to the corporate bond rate (bbb<O), the impact on this rate
(7) is unambiguously less in absolute value than that in the previous

case (4). Not surprisingly, then, allowing some substitutability
among corporate financing decisions moderates the effect of increased

deficits on the corporate bond rate. The importance of substitutability in the corporate—financing decision is empirically examined in
the third section.

Financial Intermediation
If the portfolio behavior of financial intermediaries such as

banks, insurance companies, and pension funds is different from that
of households due to regulation or other institutional features, and
if households do not view intermediaries simply as mutual funds and

adjust their own portfolio behavior accordingly, then financial intermediation may modify the impact of increased deficits on interest

rates. Indeed, Hansen (1973) and Meyer and Hart (1975) have examined
such effects in a model similar to that employed here, and found that
the addition of financial intermediaries alters the crowding—out

—9—

effect in a nontrivial way. Because financial intermediaries are
explicitly represented in the empirical model discussed in subsequent
sections, it may be useful to examine their impact in the context of
the illustrative framework presented above.

In the model, banks are taken as the representative intermediaries and they are assumed to hold required reserves (Pit), excess

reserves (ER), and corporate bonds (Bb). The sum of their asset
holdings equals total money liabilities (M) and net worth (NW). The
behavior of these intermediaries is described by the following set of
equations
H = PR + ER

RR=ctM

ERc
Bb =

(8)
r

cbbrb

+

cb(NW+M_RR)

where H represents outside money and the coefficients satisfy

Ocl, Ocbbl,
as well as the portfolio adding—up restrictions
ceb + cbb =

U c + cb = 1.

(9)

Thus, for a given required reserve ratio (ci), banks determine their

allocation of assets between excess reserves and bonds. In addition,
the market—clearing condition for bonds now becomes
Bd + Bb = BS
and household wealth may be expressed asp'
W = H + T + K.

Combining equation (8) with equations (1) and (5), the impact of
a bond—financed increase in the deficit on the corporate bond rate may

—lo-

be shown to equal
3rb —
aT

.

The effects of financial intermediation may be illustrated by several

special cases. First, if the required reserve ratio equals one (cl),
then the impact of an increased deficit (10) is unambiguously smaller
in absolute value than before if banks exhibit some interest elasticity
in their allocation of net worth between excess reserves and bond

holdings. Second, this same result follows if banks' demand for bonds
has zero elasticity with respect to the value of total discretionary

asset holdings (cbO). Finally, in comparison to equation (7), changes
in the interest sensitivity in banks' portfolio allocation (cbb) have

ambiguous effects. As a whole, the presence of financial intermediation may accentuate or diminish any crowding—out or crowding—in
effect.

To summarize, simple extensions to the illustrative model considered at the outset can significantly alter the portfolio crowding—

out effect. Before turning to the empirical investigation of the
crowding—out effect, the empirical analogue of the analytical model
discussed in this section is presented.

SPECIFICATION AND ESTIMATION OF THE MODEL

Various aspects of the empirical model used to estimate the
impact of bond—financed deficits on interest rates are discussed in

this section.-' The model consists of disaggregated demands for
Treasury securities, corporate bonds, and equities by 11 categories

of investors. The yields on these securities are determined from

(10)

—11—

market—clearing identities which equate aggregate demands with

supplies for each type of security. As such, the reduced—form expressions for security yields implicit in the model are restricted by the

underlying portfolio behavior of the different categories of inves—

tors)1

Thus, as was the case in the illustrative model considered

in the previous section, the substitutability among assets in the
individual asset demands is a primary determinant of the impact of
bond—financed deficits on interest rates.
Specificat ion

The approach used to specify the financial asset demands
attempts to capture the basic determinants of investors' short—run

portfolio allocation. One such determinant is surely the risk—return
trade—off associated with different attainable portfolios. This
trade—off may be modeled formally using the mean—variance portfolio
selection model, which serves to identify investors' desired portfolios in terms of their risk aversion and the risk and return

characteristics of individual securities. Following Friedman and
Roley (l979b), the mean—variance model may be shown to be consistent
with the following linear homogenous demands:
=
it

Ait/Wt

= a. + b. .r + c. a
iO

i=l,...,N

(11)

where the citare desired portfolio shares, the A are desired asset
it
holdings in dollars, W(=EA) is total portfolio wealth, the

are

expected asset yields, and the ak are variances associated with these
yields. These latter terms are added to the asset demands obtained
from utility maximization to represent the possible nonstationarity of

yield variances—i.e., changes in the riskiness of different types of

—12—

securities over time. The a. ,

and

Although,

investors desire to hold the portfolio shares des-

cribed in equation (11), actual short—run portfolios are often thought

to be different from those desired due to transactions costs. Because
of this important role of transactions costs, their effects should be

represented with some care. In this respect, the general portfolio
adjustment model used here distinguishes among the costs associated
with reallocating the securities currently held by the investor, the
smaller costs associated with purchasing securities from new investable
wealth flows, and the possible asymmetric costs in buying and selling

securities.-' Analytically, all of these features are represented in
the model
=

where

ikt(

twt_i,_1) +

' i=l,...,N

(12)

represents net purchases of asset i; the indices i and k

(i,k=l,. ..,N) are associated with endogenous assets;

describes the

marginal allocation of new investable wealth flows W; and the ikt
are flexible portfolio adjustment parameters.

One way this model (12) differs from the standard stock adjustment model is that it allows wealth flows to affect the reallocation of

assets already held in investors' portfolios. In particular, the

parameter describing the adjustment of last period's assets Aktl to
those desired

is not constant. Instead, this parameter is

—13—

defined as

ikt =

°ik

+ ik(t/'wt_l) +

(13)

where °ik' ik' and

are fixed coefficients satisfying the con—

and
all k; and LW and
ijj =

1i&,

ii,

positive and negative wealth flows, respectively. For posi-

tive wealth flows, for example,

equals zero, and the larger the

magnitude of the flow, the less an investor will reallocate currently

held assets. In this case movement toward desired portfolio composition may be achieved with less cost by simply investing the wealth
flow according to desired portfolio composition.

The final term in the model (12) reflects this less costly

investment strategy. This term describes the marginal allocation of
new investable wealth flows. For positive wealth flows, it is defined
to equal

investors' desired long—run portfolio composition. For

negative wealth flows, investors may not sell assets according to

desired portfolio composition for a variety of reasons—including
differential transactions costs and a possible aversion to realizing

capital losses—implying that a separate term may be needed to represent portfolio behavior in this case. Thus, the coefficient determining marginal purchases or sales is defined as
=
it

where y depends on the same factors as

(14)

in equation (11), but it

is not constrained to imply identical responses by investors to positive and negative wealth flows.

All of the terms that are additional to the standard stock

—14—

adjustment model are tested to judge their relevance. As might be
expected because of the diverse institutional and behavioral characteristics of the categories of investors included in the structural
model, several sub—cases of the general portfolio adjustment model (12)

are actually applied. Statistical tests involving zero constraints on

the ik and

parameters and equality constraints on the co and

terms are used to determine which sub—model is appropriate for each
investor category.

Data and Estimation Techniques

The investor categories included in the disaggregated structural

model are indicated in Table 1. As of yearend 1981, the investor

TABLE 1 about here

categories with endogenous demands held 96 percent of the total amount
of outstanding Treasury securities net of the Federal Reserve System
and foreign holdings, 98 percent of the total supply of corporate

bonds, and 96 percent of the total supply of equities. The primary
data source of the disaggregated structural model is the Federal

Reserve System's flow—of—funds accounts (1975), Quarterly observations are used, with the sample period beginning in l960:Ql and
ending in 1975:Q4.

The data for Treasury securities consist of four weighted
maturity classes of federal debt that are consistent with the flow—of—

funds accounts. The data are defined in terms of four "definite"
areas and three "borderline" areas. The definite areas include the

following maturities:

(1) within 1 year (short—term), (2) 2 to 4

years (short—intermediate—term), (3) 6 to 8 years (long—intermediate—

term), and (4) over 12 years (long—term). Treasury securities with
maturities in the borderline areas are allocated to the definite

classifications according to a weighting scheme. The principal advantage of this procedure is that it avoids the otherwise perverse

effects that occur when large debt issues cross fixed maturity
boundaries.

Financial flow variables corresponding to the individual assets
of the 11 investor categories are defined in terms of seasonally

adjusted net changes during the quarter. The wealth flow variables
are generally defined as quarterly net acquisitions of financial

assets, seasonally adjusted. Financial stock variables, including
individual asset stocks and total portfolio wealth, are formed by

decrementing seasonally adjusted quarterly flows from the value of

yearend outstandings in l975:Q4. This procedure serves to guarantee
the mutual consistency of the asset stock and flow data throughout the

sample period. When asset stock data contain market valuation changes,
these components are included without seasonal adjustment. The
endogenous yields correspond to the published series for the 3—month
Treasury bill yield, the 3— to 5—year Treasury security yield, the
long—term (10—year and over) Treasury security yield, the yield on new
issues of corporate bonds (Aa utilities), Standard and Poor's dividend—
price ratio, and a weighted average of yields on Treasury securities
maturing in 6, 7, and 8 years for the long—intermediate—term yield.
When statistically significant, distributed lags on the percentage
change of the Standard and Poor's composite common stock price index

—l 7—

are also included to represent expected capital gains or losses on
12/
equities.—

.

Variances of holding—period yields are represented by

lagged four— or eight—quarter moving—average variances of the sum of
the coupon return and the capital gain (or loss) on the respective
securities.

The estimated demand equations correspond to various sub—models

embodied in equation (12). For the simplest case—involving the con-

straints ik

= 0 and

=

_expansion

of equation (12)

implies that net purchases of a security depend on lagged stocks of
assets, products of expected yields with wealth flows and stocks, and

products of variances with wealth flows and stocks. The set of lagged
asset stocks consists not only of the six securities modeled here, but
also such assets as commercial paper, state and local bonds, mortgages,

and components of the monetary aggregates. Similarly, yields and
variances of yields are included for all of these categories of assets.
The structure of the supply—demand model necessitates the use of

a simultaneous equations estimation technique. This is the case
because yields on securities are jointly dependent variables along with

investors' demands. Thus, ordinary least squares estimation results in
inconsistent estimates. Because the direct application of 2SLS is not
possible due to the undersized sample problem—i.e., more predetermined

variables than sample observations—the application of an instrumental
variables technique described by Brundy and Jorgenson (1971) is used to
gain consistent estimates for the structural equations.

The particular instrumental variables procedure used involves
replacing current values of dependent variables appearing in the right—
hand side of the structural equations with fitted values obtained from

—18—

a first—stage regression. The first—stage regression for an individual structural equation has right—hand side variables consisting of
a subset of the principal components of the entire set of predetermined variables in the system of equations, augmented by the set of

predetermined variables appearing in the structural equation. In
addition, since the dependent variables being instrumented appear as

products with either wealth flows or stocks, the proper procedure of
forming an instrument for the entire multiplicative term is followed
here.

Empirical Results
In total, 51 behavioral equations representing the net purchases

of four maturity classes of Treasury securities, corporate bonds, and
equities are estimated over 64 quarterly observations beginning in

1960:Ql and ending in l975:Q4. Summary

statistics

for the estimated

equations are presented in Table 2. As indicated by the multiple

TABLE 2 about here

correlations (R2), these equations explain much of the variation of the

net purchases of the six types of securities. The multiple correlations range from 0.53 to 0.91 for equities, 0.64 to 0.87 for corporate
bonds, and 0.35 to 0.93 for the much more volatile net purchases of

Treasury securities. Comparing the individual categories of investors
using this criterion, the short—run demands of life insurance companies are explained the most successfully with multiple correlations

ranging from 0.83 to 0.96. Within individual investor categories, the

statistics reported in Table 2 also indicate that the net purchases of
each type of security are modeled with approximately equal success.

The standard errors of the estimated equations are additionally
reported to indicate the accuracy of the estimated equations in dollar
amounts.

Individual parameter estimates also support the short—run port-

folio selection model. As reported by Roley (1980,1982), all coefficients on own—yields and own—asset stocks have the anticipated sign,

and virtually all are statistically significant. Moreover, in the set
of 51 estimated demands, there is evidence that at least some asset

substitutability exists as 45 statistically significant cross—yield
terms are included.

By combining the 51 estimated equations with six market—clearing
identities that place aggregate demands equal to exogenous supplies
(net of exogenous demands) of the four maturity classes of Treasury
securities, corporate bonds, and equities, the yields on these six
types of securities along with the 51 endogenous security demands may

be simultaneously determined. The endogenous variables are determined
in this framework using both one—period and dynamic simulations

beginning in l960:Q1 and ending in 1975:Q4. The dynamic simulation
differs from the one—period (or static) simulation in that the former
uses simulated values for all lagged endogenous variables.

The results from these simulations are summarized for the six

endogenous yields in the lower half of Table 2. In both simulations,
the root—mean—square errors (RNSE) inonotonically decrease for Treasury

security yields as the maturity becomes longer, reflecting the greater

volatility of shorter term yields. Moreover, for long—term yields, the

—21—

root—mean—square errors range from only 19 basis points for the long—
term Treasury yield in the one—period simulation to 37 basis points
for the corporate bond and equity yields in the dynamic simulation.

Thus, the disaggregated structural model explains yields remarkably
well with only small biases evident in the reported results.

FINAICIAL EFFECTS OF AN INCREASE IN THE FEDERAL DEFICIT

In this section, the disaggregated structural model of the
Treasury security, corporate bond, and equity markets is used to
examine empirically the effect of an increase in the federal deficit on

interest rates. In particular, two sets of simulation experiments are

performed. First, the initial impacts of increases in each of the
four maturities of Treasury securities on the six endogenous yields are

considered. Second, the longer run effects of deficit shocks—
financed according to the historical maturity distribution of the out-

standing federal debt—are investigated. Since these experiments
involve only the financial sector, the results correspond to the port-

folio crowding—out effects reviwed in the first section.

Initial Effects of an Increase in the Deficit

To examine the short—run impact of debt—financed increases in
the deficit on interest rates, simulations involving 1 percent
increases in the stocks of the four different maturity classes of
Treasury securities are performed, with all other predetermined vari-

ables taking historical values in each period. These experiments are
not only suggestive in indicating the initial financial effects of
increased debt—financed deficits, but they may also be used to examine
whether alternative financing schemes involving the four maturities of

—22--

Treasury securities have different consequences. Indeed, in a previous study [Roley (1982)], this model was shown to imply that debt—
management operations involving changes in the maturity composition of
the federal debt significantly affect corporate bond and equity yields.
In the expanded model employed in the next section, B. Friedman (1981)
found similar effects.

As is discussed in more detail in the next subsection, the 1 percent changes in the different maturity classes of Treasury securities
are quite small in comparison to the historical innovations in the

respective net supplies. Thus, in the context of actual deficit financing policy which occurred during the sample period, the changes in
asset stocks used in the simulation experiments may be thought of as
innovations in the time—series processes which generated these asset
stocks, and not as shifts in policy regimes which may render the model

inadequate [e.g., Mishkin (1979) and Sims (1982)]. In addition, in
all of the experiments performed in this section, the total financial
asset holdings of households are increased by the amount of the change

in the deficit. Thus, the experiments correspond to "bond rains" on
households. As a consequence, the possibility of additional effects
from shifts in relative total asset holdings of different categories

of investors is ignored at this stage. As shown by B. Friedman (1980),
such effects may significantly affect relative yields if different
investors have different "preferred habitats."

One—period simulations utilizing the model exactly as outlined

in the previous section are reported on the top half of Table 3. For

short—term Treasury securities (US1), for example, the results indicate that a 1 percent rise in the amount outstanding causes the bill

yield (rT) to rise 32 basis points above its value in the control
simulation in 1966:Ql, 19 basis points in l971:Ql, and an average of
32 basis points in one—period simulations over the entire sample

period. Similarly, 1 percent increases in outstanding short—term
Treasury securities results in an average rise in the corporate bond
rate of 4 basis points, and a decline in the equity yield of 3 basis
points.

As a whole, the results from these simulations are somewhat

mixed. However, in comparing short— and long—term debt financing, the
model suggests that the former is less likely to result in crowding

out. In particular, under long—term debt financing, the average
impacts on the corporate bond and equity yields are 12 and 1 basis

points, respectively, or about 8 and 4 basis points higher than those

calculated under short—term debt financing. This difference occurs
despite the fact that the average increase in short—term Treasury
securities is over three times larger than the rise in long—term
Treasury securities.

In the next set of simulations, the supply of corporate bonds is
made endogerious by adding B. Friedman's (1979) corporate bond supply

equation to the model.— This specification is particularly well
.

suited for the experiments conducted here as it emphasizes the substi-

tutability between long— and short—term debt financing. In this
expanded model, the same simulations as before are performed, and the
impacts of increased Treasury security supplies on both yields and the
supply of corporate bonds are reported on the bottom half of Table 3.

—25--

In terms of the impacts on yields, the simulation results are
virtually the same as those reported on the top half of the table. The
average impact on the corporate bond yield is, however, reduced

slightly in the experiments concerning increases in long—term Treasury

securities. With respect to quantity effects, the substitution away
from corporate bond financing is quite small in three of the four sets

of experiments. The average reductions in net issues of corporate
bonds are $17m, $lOm, $lm, and $53m for 1 percent increases in US1,

US2, US3, and US4, respectively, where average increases in these four
maturities of Treasury securities are $ll8m, $52m, $66m, and $31m.

The results therefore indicate a high degree of substitutability
between long—term federal debt and corporate bonds, as a $31 million

average increase in long—term Treasury securities results in an
average reduction of $53 million in corporate bonds.
Dynamic Effects of an Increase in the Deficit

The longer run financial effects of an increase in the deficit

are considered in two sets of dynamic simulations. In these

experi-

ments, the innovation technique suggested by Nishkin (1979) is

employed. This approach is implemented by first estimating an equation representing the time—series process of the cumulative debt—

financed deficit over the l960:Q1 to 1975:Q4 sample period.-11 Using
the Box—Jenkins (1970) identification procedures, the time—series
model ultimately obtained is----'

Debt = cumulative debt—financed federal deficit at time t

This estimated equation (15) is then shocked by $3.5 billion, or about
one standard error, and the dynamic cumulative changes in the federal

debt are computed. The increases in the cumulative deficit which
result are financed according to the historical proportions of the
amount outstanding in each of the maturity classes of Treasury securi-

ties to the total privately—held federal debt in each quarter. It may
be verified from (15) that the $3.5 billion shock cumulates to $26.1
billion after 12 quarters, and averages $15.3 billion over the same
period.

As before, simulations are performed both with and without an

endogenously determined supply of corporate bonds. In the case of an
exogenously determined supply, dynamic simulations beginning in

l966:Ql and 1971:Q1 are reported on the top half of Table 4. In each

TABLE 4 about here

case, the dynamic simulations span 12 quarters. In comparison to the
results in Table 3, each of the simulations exhibit much larger
impacts in the initial quarter reflecting the significantly larger

magnitude of the federal debt shock. In the experiment initiated in
l966:Ql, the corporate bond yield rises throughout the 12 quarters,
while the equity yield reaches a peak and then declines to 21 basis

points above its value in the control simulation. In contrast, in
the dynamic simulation initiated in 1971:Q1, both private security

yields actually fall below their control si1Dulation values after 12
quarters.

With an endogenously determined supply of corporate bonds, the
yields exhibit similar patterns, as is apparent on the bottom half of

Table 4. In this case, however, several of the initial impacts of the
deficit shocks are somewhat smaller. Moreover, after 12 quarters, the
corporate bond yield is significantly lower in comparison to the exog-

enous supply case. The declines in net issues of corporate bonds are
also fairly small relative to the increase in the cumulative deficit.

After 12 quarters, outstanding corporate bonds fall by about $7.7 and
$4.9 billion in the experiments initiated in l966:Ql and 1971:Ql,

respectively, while the cumulative change in federal debt equals $26.1

billion in each simulation. However, to the extent that the quantity
of as well as the yield on corporate bonds influences business investment decisions, these results could be consistent with some crowding

out of investment expenditures. These general equilibrium effects are
examined in the next section.

DEFICITS, CAPITAL FORMATION, AND ECONOMIC ACTIVITY

In this section, both the nonfinancial and financial effects of
an increase in the federal deficit are examined in a model developed

by B. Friedman (1981,1982). The model consists of B. Friedman's
(1977,1979) structural model of the corporate bond market, the structural model of the Treasury securities market discussed in preceding

sections, and the MPS model. The principal differences between this
model (hereafter MPS—CGB) and the NPS model are that yields are determined in an explicit supply—demand market—clearing framework, and that

—29—

the government budget constraint is explicitly imposed.

Deficits are increased in the simulation experiments by adding

$10 billion to government expenditures in each quarter.-1' The money
stock is held at its control simulation path, thereby allowing virtually all of the rise in the deficit to be reflected in net sales of

federal debt to the public. In implementing the simulation experiments,
the Treasury bill yield is determined in the money market as in the
unaltered ME'S model, and the quantity of Treasury bills (US1) is then

proximately determined in the short—term Treasury securities market.

The remainder of the deficit that must be financed is allocated to the
other three maturities of Treasury securities according to their
historical proportions to total privately—held federal debt.
The results of two dynamic simulations are reported in Table 5.

TABLE 5 about here

As before, the simulations begin in l966:Ql and 197l:Q1. The experiments consist of increasing real government expenditures by $10 billion

in each of four quarters. In terms of interest rates, the pattern is
similar to that found in the partial—equilibrium financial model,

although the long—intermediate—term yield appears to be somewhat un-

stable. Nevertheless, all yields initially rise above control simulation levels in response to the increase in debt—financed government
expenditures, while the longer run effects on the long-term yields are

ambiguous.!71 The impact on the supply of outstanding corporate
bonds is on average smaller than before, reflecting a larger amount of

total corporate external financing resulting from the cumulative rise
in investment spending.

The effect of this debt—financed fiscal policy action on
economic activity is much smaller in the NPS—CGB model than would be

expected in the unaltered MPS model. In the MPS—CGB model, real GNP
rises by slightly more than the increase in government expenditures in
the initial quarter, but by the end of four quarters real spending

equals about one—third of the rise. Real business fixed investment
exhibits a small initial rise due to accelerator effects, but in the

1966:Q4 experiment, some real investment is crowded out after four

quarters. Moreover, the nominal federal deficit rises over the four
quarters, and since prices remain virtually unchanged from their control simulation levels, the rise mainly reflects gains in real
deficits.

As a whole, the results suggest that while a debt—financed
increase in government spending provides stimulus over four quarters,

the multiplier is less than one after a year. Moreover, the results
suggest that capital formation could be adversely affected, although

it rises on average in the simulations. One source of these rather
pessimistic results is the deficit—financing scheme adopted in the

experiments. In particular, as a consequence of the bill yield being
determined in the money market, the supply of bills held by the public
actually falls by over $1 billion after four quarters in each of the

simulations)1 Thus, the rise in the deficit in addition to this $1
billion must be financed by issuing longer term debt instruments. In
particular, slightly less than one—half of the cumulative rise in the
deficit is financed with long—intermediate— and long—term Treasury

—32—

securities. On the basis of debt—managements experiments using this
model [B. Friedman (1981)], a greater emphasis on short—term debt
financing would lead to a more expansionary fiscal policy impact on
both total spending and capital formation.

SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS

Asset substitutability played an explicit role in determining the
effects of federal deficits on interest rates and economic activity in

this paper. The role of asset substitutability was made explicit by
considering the impact of deficits in a disaggregated structural model
of the U.S. Treasury securities, corporate bond, and equity markets.
In this model, the relationships among yields depend on the substitutability of assets in the portfolios of different categories of inves-

tors. As indicated in the simple illustrative model considered at the
outset of this paper, the presence of imperfect asset substitutability
implies that the possible impact of an increase in the federal deficit
may range from crowding out to crowding in.

In simulations which examined both portfolio and total crowding
out, the results suggest that the manner in which the deficit is

financed affects interest rates. When the increased deficit is financed with short—term Treasury securities, the partial equilibrium
experiments indicated that corporate bond and equity yields change

only slightly. In contrast, when long—term debt—financing is employed,
both yields rise, particularly the corporate bond yield. Simulations
in a general equilibrium setting tended to coincide with these results,

as an increase in government expenditures financed by new issues of
Treasury securities exclusive of Treasury bills was found to be offset

—33—
significantly, but not completely, by a reduction in private
expenditures.

model, and to Benjamin Friedman, Alan Hess, Karlyn Mitchell, Carl

Government Deficits," cosponsored by the Center for the Study of

American Business and the Institute for Banking and Financial Markets,

1. The source of these data are Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System (1975) and subsequent issues. For purposes of
this introductory section, total marketable U.S. Treasury securities

are disaggregated into Federal Reserve and non—Federal Reserve
holdings.
2.

For a reduction in taxes, private spending remains at its

initial level implying an unchanged level of total spending in both of
the cases considered below.

3. This theory also hinges on operative intergenerational transfers in which the size of bequests varies with the presumed tax

liability of future generations. For evidence on the importance of
intergenerational transfers as a determinant of private saving, see

Kotlikoff and Summers (1981). For arguments and evidence against the
Ricardian equivalence view, see Feldstein (1982).

4. For other dynamic long—run analyses of the two—asset model,
see, for example, Burmeister and Phelps (1971), Infante and Stein
(1976), Tobin and Buiter (1976), and Turnovsky (1978).

5. In this model it is assumed that investors regard federal
debt as wealth, that resources are not fully employed, and that the
price level is constant.

6. A system of asset demands similar to the set of equations (1)

may

be

derived from expected utility maximization. In the expected—

utility maximization models presented by Blanchard and Plantes (1977)

and Roley (1979), positive covariances between asset yields are a
necessary but not a sufficient condition for gross substitutability.

Moreover, Roley (1983) has shown that syietry in the yield—coefficient
matrix implies constant absolute risk aversion, and hence is not a

general property of asset demands. Symmetry is not, therefore,
imposed in the asset demands (1).

7. For previous studies which examine the consequences of asset
substitutability in the three—asset model, see, for example, Tobin
(1961,1963), Brunner and Meltzer (1972), B. Friedman (1978), Cohen and

McMenamin (1978), and Walsh (1983). In contrast to the other studies
listed above and to the illustrative model discussed here, Cohen and
McMenamin (1978) consider the dynamic and long—run consequences of

asset substitutability in determining the effect of deficits. Also,
Walsh (1983) is unique in considering the impact of deficits in
models based on explicit utility maximizing behavior and rational
expectations.

8. Households are also assumed to regard the net worth of banks
(NW) as exogenous and to allocate W—NW among money, federal debt, and

corporate bonds. Thus, W—NW replaces W in equation (1), where
W = Md + Td + Bd +

=

H+T

+ K.

9. For a more complete description of this model, see Roley
(1980).

10. For a discussion of alternative models of interest—rate
determination, see Friedman and Roley (1980). For a comparison of a
version of this disaggregated structural model to the "efficient

markets" model as advanced, for example, by Pesando (1978) and
Mishkin (1978), see Roley (1981).

11. The portfolio adjustment models specified by Brainard and
Tobin (1968), Modigliani (1972), Bosworth and Duesenberry (1973), and
B. Friedman (1977) exhibit some, but not all, of these properties.

12. In a test of rational, unitary, and autoregressive models of
expectations in the context of a disaggregated structural model of the
corporate bond market, the autoregressive model used here to represent
expected capital gains on equities dominates the other expectations

models. See Friedman and Roley (l979a).
13. This corporate bond supply equation was re—estimated through
l975:Q4. The estimated coefficients remained basically unchanged
from those reported by B. Friedman (1979).

14. To conform with the simulation experiments in the next section, the aggregated debt variable—as opposed to the stocks of the

individual maturity classes of Treasury securities—is used to
evaluate the impact of deficit shocks. These deficit data should
correspond to those used by Barro (1980). However, in calculating
deficit shocks, Barro does not use an ARIMA model.

15. This model was estimated using Chase Econometrics' automated

Box—Jenkins program. The Q(26) statistic is distributed as X2(24),
and is not significantly different from zero at the 5 percent
significance level, indicating that the null hypothesis of white
noise residuals cannot be rejected.

16. While this procedure departs from the innovation technique
implemented in the previous section, the numerical values are not

drastically different. In particular, an ARIMA model was estimated
for the five exogenous categories of government expenditures in the
MPS—CGB model, and the combined standard error was about $6 billion.
Over the next three quarters, a one standard error shock yielded

values of $7.5, $7.3, and $8.1 billion. In the current version of the
program used to simulate the MPS—CCB model, only constant changes in
government expenditures may be used.

17. In a reduced—form model, Makin (1982) estimates the impact of
deficit shocks to be less than one—third of the magnitude reported

here for the Treasury bill yield. In representing deficit shocks,
Makin employs a demand shock involving exports instead of the government expenditures variable used in Table 5.

18. In the simulations, the increase in the demand for Treasury
bills resulting from the rise in the Treasury bill yield is more than
offset as a result of rises in other yields, particularly r2 and r3.
