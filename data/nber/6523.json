Thus, as an indirect measure of quality differences between managed care and traditional fee-for-service insurance, we compare the average provider volume of cancer patients covered by these two types of plans.  We find that managed care patients tend to be treated by lower volume providers and that the magnitude of the differences varies by the particular cancer and managed care plan.\n\n",
