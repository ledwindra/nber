    "abstract": "\n\nThe rise of super-app digital wallets provides not only a conduit to banks but also internal payment options, including Buy-Now-Pay-Later (BNPL). We examine, for the first time, transactions matched with merchant and consumer information, from a leading e-wallet super-app, and complement the analyses with a randomized experiment. We document that BNPL serves as a dominant form of \u201cdigital cash\u201d and expands payment and credit access to underserved consumers without increasing indebtedness or delinquencies despite their spending more. The findings crucially depend on the cross-sale capacity and inherent disciplinary incentives of super-app ecosystems. Our findings underscore the synergy between credit and payments and provide novel insights for economies transitioning to cashless via super-app-driven platforms, where FinTech credit sees the greatest potential.\n\n",

Rishi Kumar and Yiran Ning provided excellent assistance in data processing and proofreading. Due to the tightened regulation on BigTech firms in China, the data provider only permitted us to circulate the results internally (under the manuscript \u201cDemystifying E-Wallets and BNPL\u201d) from late 2020 through late 2022.
