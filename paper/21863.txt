James D. Hamilton
NBER Working Paper No. 21863
January 2016
JEL No. C32,E32,E37
ABSTRACT
Many economic time series exhibit dramatic breaks associated with events such as economic recessions,
financial panics, and currency crises. Such changes in regime may arise from tipping points or other
nonlinear dynamics and are core to some of the most important questions in macroeconomics. This
paper surveys the literature for studying regime changes and summarizes available methods. Section
1 introduces some of the basic tools for analyzing such phenomena, using for illustration the move
of an economy into and out of recession. Section 2 focuses on empirical methods, providing a detailed
overview of econometric analysis of time series that are subject to changes in regime. Section 3 discusses
theoretical treatment of macroeconomic models with changes in regime and reviews applications in
a number of areas of macroeconomics. Some brief concluding recommendations for applied researchers
are offered in Section 4.

Many economic time series exhibit dramatic breaks associated with events such as economic recessions, ﬁnancial panics, and currency crises. Such changes in regime may arise
from tipping points or other nonlinear dynamics and are core to some of the most important questions in macroeconomics. This chapter surveys the literature for studying regime
changes and summarizes available methods. Section 1 introduces some of the basic tools
for analyzing such phenomena, using for illustration the move of an economy into and out of
recession. Section 2 focuses on empirical methods, providing a detailed overview of econometric analysis of time series that are subject to changes in regime.

Section 3 discusses

theoretical treatment of macroeconomic models with changes in regime and reviews applications in a number of areas of macroeconomics. Some brief concluding recommendations
for applied researchers are oﬀered in Section 4.

Introduction: Economic recessions as changes in regime.

Figure 1 plots the U.S. unemployment rate since World War II. Shaded regions highlight a
feature of the data that is very familiar to macroeconomists— periodically the U.S. economy
enters an episode in which the unemployment rate rises quite rapidly. These shaded regions
correspond to periods that the Dating Committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research chose to designate as economic recessions. But what exactly does such a designation
signify?
One view is that the statement that the economy has entered a recession does not have
any intrinsic objective meaning.

According to this view, the economy is always subject
1

to unanticipated shocks, some favorable, others unfavorable.

A recession is then held

to be nothing more than a string of unusually bad shocks, with the bifurcation of the
observed sample into periods of “recession” and “expansion” an essentially arbitrary way of
summarizing the data.
Such a view is implicit in many theoretical models used in economics today insofar as it
is a necessary implication of the linearity we often assume in order to make our models more
tractable.

But the convenience of linear models is not a good enough reason to assume

that no fundamental changes in economic dynamics occur when the economy goes into a
recession.

For example, we understand reasonably well that in an expansion, GDP will

rise more quickly at some times than others depending on the pace of new technological
innovations.

But what exactly would we mean by a negative technology shock?

The

assumption that such events are just like technological improvements but with a negative
sign does not seem like the place we should start if we are trying to understand what really
happens during an economic downturn.
An alternative view is that on occasion some forces that are very diﬀerent from the usual
technological growth take over to determine employment and output, resulting for example
when a simultaneous drop in product demand across diﬀerent sectors and a rapid increase
in unemployed workers introduce new feedbacks of their own. The idea that there might be
a tipping point at which diﬀerent economic dynamics begin to take over will be a recurrent
theme in this chapter.
Let’s begin with a very simple model with which we can explore some of the issues. We

2

could represent the possibility that there are two distinct phases for the economy using the
random variable st . When st = 1, the economy is in expansion in period t and when st = 2,
the economy is in recession. Suppose that an observed variable yt such as GDP growth has
an average value of m1 > 0 when st = 1 and average value m2 < 0 when st = 2, as in
yt = mst + εt

(1)

where εt ∼ i.i.d. N (0, σ 2 ). Suppose that the transition between regimes is governed by a
Markov chain that is independent of εt ,
Prob(st = j|st−1 = i, st−2 = k, ..., yt−1 , yt−2 , ...) = pij

i, j = 1, 2.

(2)

Note that if both st and εt were observed directly, (1)-(2) in fact could still be described
as a linear process. We can verify directly from (2) that1
E(mst |mst−1 , mst−2 , ...) = a + φmst−1

(3)

where a = p21 m1 + p12 m2 and φ = p11 − p21 . In other words, mst follows an AR(1) process,
mst = a + φmst−1 + vt .

(4)

The innovation vt can take on only one of 4 possible values (depending on the realization of
st and st−1 ) but by virtue of (3), vt can be characterized as a martingale diﬀerence sequence.
Suppose however that we do not observe st and εt directly, but only have observations
of GDP up through date t − 1 (denoted Ωt−1 = {yt−1 , yt−2 , ...}) and want to forecast the
1

That is,
E(mst+1 |mst = m1 ) = p11 m1 + p12 m2 = p11 m1 + a − p21 m1 = a + φm1

E(mst+1 |mst = m2 ) = p21 m1 + p22 m2 = a − p12 m2 + p22 m2 = a − (1 − p11 )m2 + (1 − p21 )m2 = a + φm2 .

value of yt . Notice from equation (1) that yt is the sum of an AR(1) process (namely (4))
and a white noise process εt . Recall (e.g., Hamilton, 1994, p. 108) that the result could be
described as an ARMA(1,1) process. Thus the linear projection of GDP on its own lagged
values is given by
Ê(yt |Ωt−1 ) = a + φyt−1 + θ[yt−1 − Ê(yt−1 |Ωt−2 )]

(5)

where θ is a known function of φ, σ 2 , and the variance of vt (Hamilton, 1994, eq. [4.7.12]).
Note that we are using the notation Ê(yt |Ωt−1 ) to denote a linear projection (the forecast
that produces the smallest mean squared error among the class of all linear functions of Ωt−1 )
to distinguish it from the conditional expectation E(yt |Ωt−1 ) (the forecast that produces the
smallest mean squared error among the class of all functions of Ωt−1 ).
Because of the discrete nature of st , the linear projection (5) would not yield the optimal
forecast of GDP. We can demonstrate this using the law of iterated expectations (White,
1984, p. 54):
2

E(yt |Ωt−1 ) =
=

i=1
2

E(yt |st−1 = i, Ωt−1 )Prob(st−1 = i|Ωt−1 )

(a + φmi )Prob(st−1 = i|Ωt−1 ).

(6)

i=1

Because a probability is necessarily between 0 and 1, the optimal inference Prob(st−1 =
i|Ωt−1 ) is necessarily a nonlinear function of Ωt−1 . If data through t − 1 have persuaded us
that the economy was in expansion at that point, the optimal forecast is going to be close to
a + φm1 , whereas if we become convinced the economy was in recession, the optimal forecast
approaches a + φm2 . It is in this sense that we could characterize (1) as a nonlinear process
4

in terms of its observable implications for GDP.
Calculation of the nonlinear inference Prob(st−1 = i|Ωt−1 ) is quite simple for this process.
We could start for t = 0 for example with the ergodic probabilities of the Markov chain:
Prob(s0 = 1|Ω0 ) =

p21
p21 + p12

Prob(s0 = 2|Ω0 ) =

p12
.
p21 + p12

Given a value for Prob(st−1 = i|Ωt−1 ), we can arrive at the value for Prob(st = j|Ωt ) using
Bayes’s Law:
Prob(st = j|Ωt ) =

Prob(st = j|Ωt−1 )f (yt |st = j, Ωt−1 )
.
f (yt |Ωt−1 )

(7)

Here f (yt |st = j, Ωt−1 ) is the N(mj , σ 2 ) density,
1
−(yt − mj )2
exp
f(yt |st = j, Ωt−1 ) = √
,
2σ 2
2πσ

(8)

Prob(st = j|Ωt−1 ) is the predicted regime given past observations,
Prob(st = j|Ωt−1 ) = p1j Prob(st−1 = 1|Ωt−1 ) + p2j Prob(st−1 = 2|Ωt−1 ),

(9)

and f(yt |Ωt−1 ) is the predictive density for GDP:
2

f (yt |Ωt−1 ) =

i=1

Prob(st = i|Ωt−1 )f (yt |st = i, Ωt−1 ).

(10)

Given a value for Prob(st−1 = i|Ωt−1 ), we can thus use (7) to calculate Prob(st = j|Ωt ),
and proceed iteratively in this fashion through the data for t = 1, 2, ...T to calculate the
necessary magnitude for forming the optimal nonlinear forecast given in (6).

5

Note that another by-product of this recursion is calculation in (10) of the predictive
density for the observed data.

Thus one could estimate the vector of unknown popula-

tion parameters λ = (m1 , m2 , σ, p11 , p22 )′ by maximizing the log likelihood function of the
observed sample of GDP growth rates,
T

L(λ) =

t=1

log f (yt |Ωt−1 ; λ).

(11)

If the objective is to form an optimal inference about when the economy was in a recession,
one can use the same principles to obtain an even better inference as more data accumulates.
For example, an inference using data observed through date t + k about the regime at date
t is known as a k-period-ahead smoothed inference,
Prob(st = i|Ωt+k ),
calculation of which will be explained in equation (22) below.
Though this is a trivially simple model, it seems to do a pretty good job at capturing
what is being described by the NBER’s business cycle chronology. If we select only those
quarters for which the NBER declared the U.S. economy to be in expansion, we calculate an
average annual growth rate of 4.5%, suggesting a value for the parameter m1 = 4.5. And we
observe that if the NBER determined the economy to be in expansion in quarter t, 95% of
the time it said the same thing in quarter t + 1, consistent with a value of p11 = 0.95. These
values implied by the NBER chronology are summarized in column 3 of Table 1. On the
other hand, if we ignore the NBER dates altogether, but simply maximize the log likelihood
(11) of the observed GDP data alone, we end up with very similar estimates, as seen in
column 4.
6

Moreover, even given the challenges of data revision, the one-quarter-ahead smoothed
probabilities have an excellent out-of-sample record at tracking the NBER dates. Figure 2
plots historical values for Prob(st = 2|Ωt+1 , λ̂t+1 ) where only GDP data as it was actually
released as of date t + 1 was used to estimate parameters and form the inference plotted for
date t. Values before the vertical line are “simulated real-time” inferences from Chauvet and
Hamilton (2006), that is, values calculated in 2005 using a separate historical real-time data
vintage for each date t shown. Values after the vertical line are true real-time out-of-sample
inferences as they have been published individually on www.econbrowser.com each quarter
since 2005 without revision.
One attractive feature of this approach is that the linearity of the model conditional on st
makes it almost as tractable as a fully linear model. For example, an optimal k-period-ahead
forecast of GDP growth based only on observed growth through date t can be calculated
immediately using (4),
E(yt+k |Ωt ) = µ + φk

2

(mi − µ)Prob(st = i|Ωt )

(12)

i=1

for µ = a/(1 − φ). Results like this make this model of changes in regime very convenient
to work with.

Econometric treatment of changes in regime.

This section discusses econometric inference for data that may be subject to changes in
regime, while Section 3 examines methods to incorporate changes in regime into theoretical
economic models.
7

2.1

Multivariate or non-Gaussian processes.

Although the model in Section 1 was quite stylized, the same basic principles can be used to
investigate changes in regime in much richer settings. Suppose we have a vector of variables
yt observed at date t and hypothesize that the density of yt conditioned on its past history
Ωt−1 = {yt−1 , yt−2 , ...} depends on parameters θ some or all of which are diﬀerent depending
on the regime st :
f(yt |st = i, Ωt−1 ) = f (yt |Ωt−1 ; θi )

for i = 1, ..., N.

(13)

In the example in Section 1, there were N = 2 possible regimes with θ1 = (m1 , σ)′ , θ2 =
(m2 , σ)′ , and f (yt |Ωt−1 ; θi ) the N (mi , σ 2 ) density. But the same basic approach would work
for an n-dimensional vector autoregression in which some or all of the parameters change
with the regime,
yt = Φst ,1 yt−1 + Φst ,2 yt−2 + · · · + Φst ,r yt−r + cst + εt
= Φst xt−1 + εt

(14)

εt |st , Ωt−1 ∼ N(0, Σst ),

(15)

a class of models discussed in detail in Krolzig (1997). Here xt−1 is an (nr + 1) × 1 vector
consisting of a constant term and r lags of y:
′
′
′
xt−1 = (yt−1
, yt−2
, ..., yt−r
, 1)′ .

8

In this case the density of yt conditional on its own past values and the regime st taking the
value i would be
f (yt |st = i, Ωt−1 ) =

1
(2π)n/2 |Σi |1/2

exp −(1/2)(yt − Φi xt−1 )′ Σ−1
i (yt − Φi xt−1 ) .

(16)

There is also no reason that a Gaussian density has to be used. For example, Dueker
(1997) proposed a model of stock returns in which the innovation comes from a Student t
distribution whose degrees of freedom parameter η changes with the regime.

2.2

Multiple regimes.

A convenient representation for a model with N > 2 regimes is obtained by collecting the
transition probabilities in a matrix P whose row j, column i element corresponds to pij (so
that columns of P sum to unity). We likewise summarize the regime at date t by an (N × 1)
vector ξ t whose ith element is unity when st = i and is zero otherwise— in other words, ξ t
corresponds to column st of IN . Notice that E(ξ t |st−1 = i) has the interpretation

Thus the Markov chain admits a VAR(1) representation, with k-period-ahead regime probabilities conditional on the observed data Ωt given by

Calculation of the moments and discussion of stationarity conditions for general processes
subject to changes in regime can be found in Tjøstheim (1986), Yang (2000), Timmermann
(2000), and Francq and Zakoïan (2001).
Although most applications assume a relatively small number of regimes, Sims and Zha
(2006) used Bayesian prior information in a model with N as large as 10, while Calvet
and Fisher (2004) estimated a model with thousands of regimes by imposing a functional
restriction on the ways parameters vary across regimes.

2.3

Processes that depend on current and past regimes.

In the original model proposed by Hamilton (1989) for describing economic recessions, the
conditional density of GDP growth yt was presumed to depend not just on the current regime
but also on the r previous regimes:
yt = mst + φ1 (yt−1 − mst−1 ) + φ2 (yt−2 − mst−2 ) + · · · + φr (yt−r − mst−r ) + εt .

(18)

While at ﬁrst glance this might not appear to be a special case of the general formulation
given in (13), this in fact is just a matter of representing (18) using the right notation.
Taking r = 1 for illustration, deﬁne
10

Inference about regimes and evaluating the likelihood for the
general case.

For any of the examples above we could collect the set of possible densities conditional on
one of N diﬀerent possible regimes in an (N × 1) vector η t whose ith element is f (yt |st =
i, Ωt−1 ; λ) for Ωt−1 = {yt−1 , yt−2 , ..., y1 ) and λ a vector consisting of all the unknown
population parameters. For example, for the Markov-switching vector autoregression the
ith element of η t is given by (16) and λ is a vector collecting the unknown elements of
{Φ1 , ..., ΦN , Σ1 , ..., ΣN , P} for P the (N × N) matrix whose row j column i element is
Prob(st+1 = j|st = i) (so columns of P sum to unity). We likewise can deﬁne the (N × 1)
11

vector ξ̂t|t whose ith element is the probability Prob(st = i|Ωt ; λ). One goal is to take the
inference ξ̂ t−1|t−1 and update it to calculate ξ̂ t|t using the observation on yt . Hamilton (1994,
p. 692) showed that this can be accomplished by calculating
ξ̂ t|t−1 = Pξ̂t−1|t−1
ξ̂t|t =

(ξ̂ t|t−1 ⊙ η t )

(19)

1′ (ξ̂t|t−1 ⊙ η t )

where 1 denotes an (N × 1) vector of ones and ⊙ denotes element-by-element vector multiplication.
If the Markov chain is known to be ergodic, we could begin the recursion for t = 1 by
setting ξ̂ 1|0 to the vector of unconditional probabilities, which as in Hamilton (1994, p. 684)
can be found from the (N + 1)th column of the matrix (A′ A)−1 A′ for

regime 1), complete ignorance (ρi = 1/N for i = 1, ..., N ), or ρ could be a separate vector
of parameters also to be chosen by maximum likelihood.

Any of the last three options

is particularly attractive if the EM algorithm described in Section 2.5 or Gibbs sampler in
12

Section 2.8 are used, or if one wants to allow the possibility of a permanent regime shift
which would mean that the Markov chain is not ergodic.
In a generalization of (10) and (11), the log likelihood function for the observed data is
naturally calculated as a by-product of the above recursion:
L(λ) =

T
t=1

log f (yt |Ωt−1 ; λ) =

T
t=1

log[1′ (ξ̂ t|t−1 ⊙ η t )].

(21)

From (17) the k-period-ahead forecast of the regime, Prob(st+k = j|Ωt ; λ) is found from the
jth element of Pk ξ̂ t|t .
It’s also often of interest to calculate an inference about the regime at date t conditional
on the full set of all observations through the end of the sample T, known as the “smoothed
probability.” The smoothed Prob(st = i|ΩT ; λ) is obtained from the ith element of ξ̂ t|T
which can be calculated as in Hamilton (1994, p. 694) by iterating backwards for t =
T − 1, T − 2, ..., 1 on
ξ̂ t|T = ξ̂ t|t ⊙ {P′ [ξ̂ t+1|T (÷) ξ̂ t+1|t ]}

(22)

where (÷) denotes element-by-element division.

2.5

EM algorithm.

The unknown parameters λ could be estimated by maximizing the likelihood function (21)
using numerical search methods.

Alternatively, Hamilton (1990) noted that the EM al-

gorithm is often a convenient method for ﬁnding the maximum of the likelihood function.
This algorithm is simplest if we treat the initial probabilities ξ̂1|0 as a vector of free parameters ρ rather than using ergodic probabilities from (20). This section describes how the
13

EM algorithm would be implemented for the case of an unrestricted Markov-switching VAR
(14), in which case λ includes ρ along with the elements of {Φ1 , ..., ΦN , Σ1 , ..., ΣN , P}. The
(ℓ)

EM algorithm is an iterative procedure for generating a sequence of estimates {λ̂ } where
(ℓ+1)

the algorithm guarantees that the log likelihood (21) evaluated at λ̂

is greater than or

(ℓ)

equal to that at λ̂ . Iterating until convergence leads to a local maximum of the likelihood
function.
(ℓ+1)

To calculate the value of λ̂

(ℓ)

we ﬁrst use λ̂

in equation (22) to evaluate the smoothed

(ℓ)

probabilities Prob(st = i|ΩT ; λ̂ ) and also smoothed joint probabilities Prob(st = i, st+1 =
(ℓ)

j|ΩT ; λ̂ ). The latter are obtained from the row i column j element of the (N × N ) matrix2

(ℓ)

(ℓ)

(ℓ)

(ℓ)

{ξ̂ t|t (λ̂ )[ξ̂ t+1|T (λ̂ ) (÷) (P̂ ξ̂t|t (λ̂ )]′ } ⊙ P̂(ℓ)′ .

(23)

We then use these smoothed probabilities to generate a new estimate ρ̂(ℓ+1) , whose ith
(ℓ)

element is obtained from Prob(s1 = i|ΩT ; λ̂ ), along with a new estimate P̂(ℓ+1) whose row
j column i element is given by

Prob(st+1 = j|Ωt )

which from equation [22.A.21] in Hamilton (1994) equals Prob(st = i, st+1 = j|ΩT ).

We thus simply iterate between calculating smoothed probabilities and OLS regressions of
yt on its lags weighted by those smoothed probabilities. The algorithm will converge to a
point that is at least a local maximum of the log likelihood (21) with respect to λ subject
to the constraints that ρ′ 1 = 1, 1′ P = 1′ , all elements of ρ and P are nonnegative, and Σj
is positive semideﬁnite for j = 1, ..., N.

2.6

EM algorithm for restricted models.

Often we might want to use a more parsimonious representation to which the EM algorithm
is easily adapted. For example, suppose that we assume that there are no changes in regime
for the equations describing the ﬁrst n1 variables in the system:
y1t = Axt−1 + ε1t





As in Hamilton (1994, p. 310) it is convenient to reparameterize the system by premultiplying
(25) by Σ21,st Σ−1
11 and subtracting the result from (26) to obtain
y2t = Cst y1t + Dst xt−1 + v2t

(27)

−1
−1
′
where Cst = Σ21,st Σ−1
11 , Dst = Bst −Σ21,st Σ11 A, v2t = ε2t −Σ21,st Σ11 ε1t , and E(v2t v2t |st ) =

Hst = Σ22,st −Σ21,st Σ−1
11 Σ12,st . Then the likelihood associated with the system (25) and (27)
15

factors into a regime-switching component and a regime-independent component parameterized by A, Σ11 . In the absence of restrictions on Bst , Σ21,st , and Σ22,st , the values for A and
Σ11 do not restrict the likelihood for the regime-switching block, meaning full-information
maximum likelihood for the complete system can be implemented by maximizing the likelihood separately for the two blocks. For the regime-independent block, the MLE is obtained
by simple OLS:

then found simply by reversing the transformation that led to (27), for example Σ̂21,j =

Alternatively, suppose we want to restrict the switching coeﬃcients to apply only to a
subset x2,t−1 of the original regressors, as for example in a VAR in which only the intercept
(the last element of xt−1 ) is changing with regime,

Structural vector autoregressions and impulse-response functions.

A Gaussian structural vector autoregression takes the form
Ast yt = Bst xt−1 + ut
′
′
′
where xt−1 = (yt−1
, yt−2
, ..., yt−r
, 1)′ and ut |st , Ωt−1 ∼ N (0, Dst ). Here the elements of

ut are interpreted as diﬀerent structural shocks which are identiﬁed by imposing certain
restrictions on Ai , Bi , and Di . For example, the common Cholesky identiﬁcation assumes
that the structural equations are recursive, with Di diagonal and Ai lower triangular with
3

ones along the diagonal. For an identiﬁed structure we could estimate parameters by setting
the ith element of η t in (19) to
1
η it =
(2π)n/2

|Ai |2
|Di |

exp −(1/2)(Ai yt − Bi xt−1 )′ D−1
i (Ai yt − Bi xt−1 )

and then choosing {A1 , ..., AN , B1 , ..., BN , D1 , ..., DN , P} to maximize the likelihood (21).
A faster algorithm is likely to be obtained by ﬁrst ﬁnding the MLE’s {Φ̂1 , ..., Φ̂N , Σ̂1 , ..., Σ̂N , P̂, ρ̂}
for the reduced form (14)-(15) using the EM algorithm in Section 2.5. If the model is justidentiﬁed, we can just translate these into the implied structural parameters {Â1 , ..., ÂN , B̂1 , ...,
B̂N , D̂1 , ..., D̂N , P̂, ρ̂}, while for an over-identiﬁed model we could ﬁnd the values for the
structural parameters that are closest to the reduced form using minimum chi-square estimation (e.g., Hamilton and Wu, 2012). For example, for the Cholesky formulation we would
just ﬁnd the Cholesky factorization P̂i P̂′i = Σ̂i for each i. The row j column j element of D̂i
1/2

is then the square of the row j column j element of P̂i . Then Âi = D̂i P̂−1
i and B̂i = Âi Φ̂i .
Users of structural vector autoregressions are often interested in structural impulseresponse functions, which in this case are functions of the regime at date t:
Hmj =

∂E(yt+m |st = j, Ωt )
∂E(yt+m |st = j, Ωt ) ∂εt
=
= Ψmj A−1
j .
′
∂ut
∂ε′t
∂u′t

The nonorthogonalized or reduced-form IRF, Ψmj , can be found as follows.

Suppose we

ﬁrst condition not just on the regime j at date t but also on a particular regime j1 for date
t + 1, j2 for t + 2, and jm for t + m, and consider the value of
Ψ̃m,j,j1 ,...,jm =

∂E(yt+m |st = j, st+1 = j1 , ..., st+m = jm , Ωt )
.
∂ε′t
18

Karamé (2010) noted that this (n × n) matrix can be calculated from the recursion
Ψ̃m,j,j1 ,...,jm = Φ1,jm Ψ̃m−1,j,j1 ,...,jm−1 + Φ2,jm Ψ̃m−2,j,j1 ,...,jm−2 + · · · + Φr,jm Ψ̃m−r,j,j1 ,...,jm−r
for m = 1, 2, ... where Ψ̃0j = In and 0 = Ψ̃−1,. = Ψ̃−2,. = · · · . The object of interest is
found by integrating out the conditioning variables,
Ψmj =

These magnitudes can either be calculated analytically for modest m and N or by simulation.
Such regime-speciﬁc impulse-response functions are of interest for questions such as
whether monetary policy (Lo and Piger, 2005) or ﬁscal policy (Auerbach and Gorodnichenko,
2012) have diﬀerent eﬀects on the economy during an expansion or recession.

2.8

Bayesian inference and the Gibbs sampler.

Bayesian methods oﬀer another popular approach for econometric inference. The Bayesian
begins with prior beliefs about the unknown parameters λ which are represented using
a probability density f(λ) that associates a higher probability with values of λ that are
judged to be more plausible. The goal of inference is to revise these beliefs in the form of
a posterior density f(λ|ΩT ) based on the observed data ΩT = {y1 , ..., yT }. Often the prior
distribution f (λ) is assumed to be taken from a particular parametric family known as a
natural conjugate distribution. These have the property that the prior and posterior are
from the same family, as would be the case for example if the prior beliefs were based on

19

an earlier sample of data. Natural conjugates are helpful because they allow many of the
results to be obtained using known analytic solutions.
Again we will illustrate some of the main ideas using a Markov-switching vector autoregression:
yt = Φst xt−1 + εt
εt |st = i ∼ N(0, Σi )
Prob(s1 = i) = ρi
Prob(st = j|st−1 = i) = pij .
Prior distributions.
The Dirichlet distribution is the natural conjugate for the parameters that determine the
Markov transition probabilities. Suppose z = (z1 , ..., zN )′ is an (N ×1) vector of nonnegative
random variables that sum to unity. The Dirichlet density with parameter α = (α1 , ..., αN )′
is given by
f (z) =

Γ(α1 + · · · + αN ) α1 −1
αN −1
z
· · · zN
Γ(α1 ) · · · Γ(αN ) 1

for Γ(.) the gamma function, with the constant ensuring that the density integrates to unity
over the set of vectors z satisfying the speciﬁed conditions. The beta distribution is a special
case when N = 2, usually expressed as a function of the scalar z1 ∈ (0, 1),
f (z1 ) =

Γ(α1 + α2 ) α1 −1
z
(1 − z1 )α2 −1 .
Γ(α1 )Γ(α2 ) 1

We then represent prior beliefs over the (N ×1) vector of initial probabilities as (ρ1 , ..., ρN ) ∼
D(α1 , ..., αN ) and those for transition probabilities as (pi1 , ..., piN ) ∼ D(αi1 , ..., αiN ) for i =
20

1, ..., N.
The natural conjugate for Σj ,the innovation variance matrix for regime j, is provided by
the Wishart distribution. Let zi be independent (n × 1) N(0, Λ−1 ) vectors and consider the
matrix W = z1 z′1 + · · · + zη z′η for η > n − 1. This matrix is said to have an n-dimensional
Wishart distribution with η degrees of freedom and scale matrix Λ−1 , whose density is
f(W) = c|Λ|η/2 |W|(η−n−1)/2 exp [−(1/2) tr (WΛ)]
where tr(.) denotes the trace (sum of diagonal elements). For a univariate regression (n = 1)
this becomes Λ−1 times a χ2 (η) variable, or equivalently a gamma distribution with mean
η/Λ and variance 2η/Λ2 . The constant c is chosen so that the density integrates to unity
over the set of all positive deﬁnite symmetric matrices W (e.g., DeGroot, 1970, p. 57):

Prior information about the regression coeﬃcients ϕj = vec(Φ′j ) for regime j can be
represented with a N(mj , Mj ) distribution. The formulas are much simpler in the case of
no useful prior information about these coeﬃcients (which can be viewed as the limit of the
inference as M−1
j → 0), and this limiting case will be used for the results presented here.

Gibbs sampler.
The idea behind the Gibbs sampler is to take advantage of the above known conditional
distributions to generate a sequence of random variables whose unconditional distribution
will turn out to be the object we’re interested in. Suppose that as the result of a previous
iteration ℓ we had generated particular numerical values for ϕ, σ, p, S. We could for example
begin iteration ℓ = 1 with arbitrary initial guesses for the parameters along with a possible realization of the regime for each date. Given the numbers from iteration ℓ, we could generate

posterior f (S|ΩT , p(ℓ+1) , σ (ℓ+1) , ϕ(ℓ+1) ) by iterating backwards on a variant of the smoothing
algorithm in Section 2.4. Speciﬁcally, given the values (p(ℓ+1) , σ (ℓ+1) , ϕ(ℓ+1) ) we can iterate

}t=1

on (19) for t = 1, ..., T to calculate the (N × 1) vector {ξ̂ t|t
(ℓ+1)

Prob(st = j|Ωt , p(ℓ+1) , σ (ℓ+1) , ϕ(ℓ+1) ). To generate sT

whose jth element is

, we ﬁrst generate a U(0, 1) variate.
(ℓ+1)

If this is smaller than the calculated Prob(sT = 1|ΩT , p(ℓ+1) , σ (ℓ+1) , ϕ(ℓ+1) ), we set sT

= 1.

If the uniform variable turns out to be between Prob(sT = 1|ΩT , p(ℓ+1) , σ (ℓ+1) , ϕ(ℓ+1) ) and
the sum Prob(sT = 1|ΩT , p(ℓ+1) , σ (ℓ+1) , ϕ(ℓ+1) )+ Prob(sT = 2|ΩT , p(ℓ+1) , σ (ℓ+1) , ϕ(ℓ+1) ), we set
s(ℓ+1)
= 2, and so on. After we have generated a particular value for s(ℓ+1)
we can use (23)

|ΩT , p(ℓ+1) , σ (ℓ+1) , ϕ(ℓ+1) )

(ℓ+1)

with which we generate a draw sT −1 . Iterating backwards in this manner gives us the full
sequence S (ℓ+1) .
We now have a complete new set p(ℓ+1) , σ (ℓ+1) , ϕ(ℓ+1) , S (ℓ+1) , from which we can then
generate values for ℓ + 2, ℓ + 3, and so on.

The idea behind the Gibbs sampler (e.g.,

Albert and Chib, 1993) is that the sequence corresponds to a Markov chain whose ergodic
25

distribution under general conditions is the true posterior distribution f (p, σ, ϕ, S|ΩT ). The
proposal is then to discard the ﬁrst say 106 draws and retain the next 106 draws as a sample
from the posterior distribution.
One can also adapt approaches like those in Section 2.6 to apply the Gibbs sampler to
restricted models. For example, if regime switching is conﬁned to a subset of the equations,
we can use the parameterization (27) and perform inference on the regime-switching subset
independently from the rest of the system.
Although very convenient for many applications, one caution to be aware of in applying
the Gibbs sampler is the role of label switching. Strategies for dealing with this are discussed
by Celeux, Hurn and Robert (2000), Frühwirth-Schnatter (2001), and Geweke (2007).

2.9

Time-varying transition probabilities.

While the calculations above assumed that regimes are characterized by an exogenous
Markov chain, this is easily generalized. We could replace (2) with
Prob(st = j|st−1 = i, st−2 = k, ..., Ωt−1 ) = pij (xt−1 ; λ)

i, j = 1, ..., N

(33)

where xt−1 is a subset of Ωt−1 or other observed variables on which one is willing to condition
and pij (xt−1 ; λ) is a speciﬁed parametric function. The generalization of (9) then becomes
N

Prob(st = j|Ωt−1 ) =

pij (xt−1 ; λ)Prob(st−1 = i|Ωt−1 ).
i=1

where the sequence Prob(st = i|Ωt ) can still be calculated iteratively as in (7),
Prob(st = j|Ωt ) =

Prob(st = j|Ωt−1 )f (yt |Ωt−1 ; θj )
f(yt |Ωt−1 )
26

(34)

with the predictive density in the denominator now
N

f (yt |Ωt−1 ) =

i=1

Prob(st = i|Ωt−1 )f (yt |Ωt−1 ; θ i ).

(35)

Diebold, Lee and Weinbach (1994) showed how the EM algorithm works in such a setting,
while Filardo and Gordon (1998) developed a Gibbs sampler. Other interesting applications
with time-varying transition probabilities include Filardo (1994) and Peria (2002).

2.10

Latent-variable models with changes in regime.

A more involved case that cannot be handled using the above devices is when the conditional
density of yt depends on the full history of regimes (st , st−1 , ..., s1 ) through date t. One
important case in which this arises is when a process moving in and out of recession phase is
proposed as an unobserved latent variable inﬂuencing an (n × 1) vector of observed variables
yt . For example, Chauvet (1998) speciﬁed a process for an unobserved scalar business-cycle
factor Ft characterized by
Ft = αst + φFt−1 + η t
which inﬂuences the observed yt according to
yt = ψFt + qt
for ψ an (n × 1) vector of factor loadings and elements of qt presumed to follow separate
autoregressions. This can be viewed as a state-space model with regime-dependent parameters in which the conditional density (13) turns out to depend on the complete history
(st , st−1 , ..., s1 ).
27

One approach for handling such models is an approximation to the log likelihood and
optimal inference developed by Kim (1994).

Chauvet and Hamilton (2006) and Chauvet

and Piger (2008) demonstrated the real-time usefulness of this approach for recognizing U.S.
recessions with yt a (4 × 1) vector of monthly indicators of sales, income, employment and
industrial production, while Camacho, Perez-Quiros and Poncela (2014) have had success
using a more detailed model for the Euro area.
The Gibbs sampler oﬀers a particularly convenient approach for this class of models. We
simply add the unobserved sequence of factors {F1 , ..., FT } as another random block to be
sampled from along with p, σ, ϕ, and S. Conditional on {F1 , ..., FT }, draws for those other
blocks can be performed exactly as in Section 2.8, while draws for {F1 , ..., FT } conditional on
the regimes and other parameters can be calculated using well-known algorithms associated
with the Kalman ﬁlter; see Kim and Nelson (1999a) for details.

2.11

Selecting the number of regimes.

Often one would want to test the null hypothesis that there are N regimes against the
alternative of N + 1, and in particular to test the null hypothesis that there are no changes
in regime at all (H0 : N = 1). A natural idea would be to compare the values achieved for
the log likelihood (21) for N and N +1. Unfortunately, the likelihood ratio does not have the
usual asymptotic χ2 distribution because under the null hypothesis, some of the parameters
of the model become unidentiﬁed.

For example, if one thought of the null hypothesis

in (1) as m1 = m2 , when the null is true the maximum likelihood estimates p̂11 and p̂22
do not converge to any population values.

Hansen (1992) and Garcia (1998) examined
28

the distribution of the likelihood ratio statistic in this setting, though implementing their
procedures can be quite involved if the model is at all complicated. Cho and White (2007)
and Carter and Steigerwald (2012, 2013) suggested quasi-likelihood ratio tests that ignore
the Markov property of st . For discussion of some of the subtleties and possible solutions for
the case of i.i.d. regime changes see Hall and Stewart (2005) and Chen and Li (2009).
An alternative is to calculate instead general measures that trade oﬀ the ﬁt of the likelihood against the number of parameters estimated.

Popular methods such as Schwarz’s

(1978) Bayesian criterion rely for their asymptotic justiﬁcation on the same regularity conditions whose failure causes the likelihood ratio statistic to have a nonstandard distribution.
But Smith, Naik, and Tsai (2006) developed a simple test that can be used to select the
number of regimes for a Markov-switching regression,
yt = x′t β st + σ st εt

(36)

where εt ∼ N (0, 1) and st follows an N -state Markov chain.

The authors proposed to

estimate the parameter vector λ = (β ′1 , ..., β ′N , σ 1 , ..., σ N , pij,i=1,...,N;j=1,..,N−1 )′ by maximum
likelihood for each possible choice of N and calculate
T̂i =

T
t=1

Prob(st = i|ΩT ; λ̂MLE )

for i = 1, ..., N

using the full-sample smoothed probabilities. They suggested choosing the value of N for
which

M SC = −2L(λ̂MLE )+
29

N
i=1

T̂i (T̂i + Nk)
T̂i − Nk − 2

is smallest, where k is the number of elements in the regression vector β. Other alternatives
are to use Bayesian methods to ﬁnd the value of N that leads to the largest value for the
marginal likelihood (Chib, 1998) or the highest Bayes factor (Koop and Potter, 1999).
Another promising test of the null hypothesis of no change in regime was developed by
Carrasco, Hu, and Ploberger (2014). Let ℓt = log f (yt |Ωt−1 ; λ) be the log of the predictive
density of the tth observation under the null hypothesis of no switching. For the Markovswitching regression (36), λ would correspond to the ﬁxed-regime regression coeﬃcients and
variance (β ′ , σ 2 )′ :
ℓt = −(1/2) log(2πσ 2 ) −

(yt − x′t β)2
.
2σ 2

Deﬁne ht to be the derivative of the log density with respect to the parameter vector,
ht =

∂ℓt
∂λ

λ=λ̂0

where λ̂0 denotes the MLE under the null hypothesis of no change in regime. For example,

We then ﬁnd the value ρ∗ that maximizes C(ρ) over some range (e.g., ρ ∈ [0.2, 0.8]) and

bootstrap to see if C(ρ∗ ) is statistically signiﬁcant. This is done by generating data with no
changes in regime using the MLE λ = λ̂0 and calculating C(ρ∗ ) on each generated sample.
Another option is to conduct generic tests developed by Hamilton (1996) of the hypothesis
that an N -regime model accurately describes the data. For example, if the model is correctly
speciﬁed, the derivative of the log of the predictive density with respect to any element of
the parameter vector,
∂ log p(yt |Ωt−1 ; λ)
∂λi

,
λ=λ̂MLE

should be impossible for predict from its own lagged values, a hypothesis that can be tested
using simple regressions.

2.12

Deterministic breaks.

Another common approach is to treat the changes in regime as deterministic rather than
random. If we wanted to test the null hypothesis of constant coeﬃcients against the alternative that a certain subset of the coeﬃcients of a regression switched at ﬁxed known dates
t1 , t2 , ..., tN , we could do this easily enough using a standard F test (see for example Fisher,
1970). If we do not know the dates, we could calculate the value of the F statistic for every
set of allowable N partitions, eﬃcient algorithms for which have been described by Bai and
31

Perron (2003) and Doan (2012), with critical values for interpreting the supremum of the
F statistics provided by Bai and Perron (1998).

Bai and Perron (1998) also described a

sequential procedure with which one could ﬁrst test the null hypothesis of no breaks against
the alternative of N = 1 break, and then test N = 1 against N = 2, and so on.
Although simpler to deal with econometrically, deterministic structural breaks have the
drawback that they are diﬃcult to incorporate in a sensible way into models based on rational
decision makers. Neither the assumption that people knew perfectly that the change was
coming years in advance, nor the assumption that they were certain that nothing would
ever change (when in the event the change did indeed appear) is very appealing. There is
further the practical issue of how users of such econometric models are supposed to form
their own future forecasts. Pesaran and Timmermann (2007) suggested estimating models
over windows of limited subsamples, watching the data for an indication that it is time
to switch to using a new model.

Another drawback of interpreting structural breaks as

deterministic events is that such approaches make no use of the fact that regimes such as
business downturns may be a recurrent event.

2.13

Chib’s multiple change-point model.

Chib (1998) oﬀered a way to interpret multiple change-point models that gets around some
of the awkward features of deterministic structural breaks.

Chib’s model assumes that

when the process is in regime i the conditional density of the data is governed by parameter
vector θ i as in (13).

Chib assumed that the process begins at date 1 in regime st = 1

and parameter vector θ 1 , and will stay there the next period with probability p11 . With
32

probability 1 − p11 we get a new value θ2 , drawn perhaps from a N (θ1 , Σ) distribution.
Conditional on knowing that there were N such breaks, this could be viewed as a special
case of an N -state Markov-switching model with transition probability matrix taking the
form

The total number of regime changes N could then be selected using one of the methods
discussed above.
Again it’s not clear how to form out-of-sample forecasts with this speciﬁcation.

Pe-

saran, Pettenuzzo, and Timmermann (2006) proposed embedding Chib’s model within a
hierarchical prior with which one could forecast future changes in regime based on the size
and duration of past breaks.

2.14

Smooth transition models.

Another econometric approach to changes in regime is the smooth transition regression model
(Teräsvirta, 2004):
yt =

exp[−γ(zt−1 − c)]
1
x′t−1 β 1 +
x′ β + ut .
1 + exp[−γ(zt−1 − c)]
1 + exp[−γ(zt−1 − c)] t−1 2

33

(37)

Here the scalar zt−1 could be one of the elements of xt−1 or some known function of xt−1 .
For γ > 0, as zt−1 → −∞, the regression coeﬃcients go to β 1 , while when zt−1 → ∞, the
regression coeﬃcients approach β 2 . The parameter γ governs how quickly the coeﬃcients
transition as zt−1 crosses the threshold c.
If xt−1 = (yt−1 , yt−2 , ..., yt−r )′ , this is Teräsvirta’s (1994) smooth-transition autoregression, for which typically zt−1 = yt−d for some lag d. More generally, given a data-generating
process for xt , (37) is a fully speciﬁed time-series process for which forecasts at any horizon
can be calculated by simulation.

One important challenge is how to choose the lag d or

more generally the switching variable zt−1 . Although in some settings the forecast might be
similar to that coming from (6), the weights Prob(st−1 = i|Ωt−1 ) in the latter would be a
function of the entire history {yt−1 , yt−2 , ..., y1 } rather than any single value.

Economic theory and changes in regime.

The previous section discussed econometric issues associated with analyzing series subject
to changes in regime.

This section reviews how these features can appear in theoretical

models of the economy.

3.1

Closed-form solution of DSGE’s and asset-pricing implications.

In some settings it is possible to ﬁnd exact analytical solutions for a full dynamic stochastic
general equilibrium model subject to changes in regime. A standard ﬁrst-order condition

34

in many macro models holds that
U ′ (Ct ) = βEt [U ′ (Ct+1 )(1 + rj,t+1 )]

(38)

where Ct denotes consumption of a representative consumer, β a time-discount rate, and
rj,t+1 the real return on asset j between t and t + 1. Lucas (1978) proposed a particularly
simple setting in which aggregate output comes solely from nonreproducible assets (sometimes thought of as fruit coming from trees) for which equilibrium turns out to require that
Ct equals the aggregate real dividend Dt paid on equities (or the annual crop of fruit). If
the utility function exhibits constant relative risk aversion (U (C) = (1 + γ)−1 C (1+γ) , the
aggregate equilibrium real stock price must satisfy
Pt = Dt−γ

∞
k=1

(1+γ)

β k Et Dt+k .

Since the dividend process {Dt+k } is exogenous in this model, one could simply assume that
the change in the log of Dt is characterized by a process such as (1). Cecchetti, Lam and
Mark (1990) used calculations related to those in (12) to ﬁnd the closed-form solution for
the general-equilibrium stock price,
Pt = ρst Dt ,
where the values of ρ1 and ρ2 are given in equations (11) and (12) in their paper.
Lucas’s assumption of an exogenous consumption and dividend process is obviously quite
restrictive.

Nevertheless, asset-pricing relations such as (38) have to hold regardless of

how we close the rest of the model.

We can always use (38) or other basic asset-pricing

conditions along with an assumed process for returns to ﬁnd the implications of changes
35

in regime for ﬁnancial variables in more general settings. There is a very large literature
investigating these issues, covering topics such as portfolio allocation (Ang and Bekaert,
2002a; Guidolin and Timmermann, 2008), ﬁnancial implications of rare-event risk (Evans,
1996; Barro, 2006), option pricing (Elliott, Chan, and Siu 2005), and the term structure of
interest rates (Bekaert, Hodrick, and Marshall, 2001; Ang and Bekaert, 2002b; Bansal and
Zhou, 2002). For a survey of this literature see Ang and Timmermann (2012).

3.2

Approximating the solution to DSGE’s using perturbation
methods.

First-order conditions for a much broader class of dynamic stochastic general equilibrium
models with Markov regime-switching take the form
Et a(yt+1 , yt , xt , xt−1 , εt+1 , εt , θst+1 , θst ) = 0.

(39)

Here a(.) is an [(ny + nx) × 1] vector-valued function, yt an (ny × 1) vector of control
variables (also sometimes referred to as endogenous jump variables), xt an (nx × 1) vector
of predetermined endogenous or exogenous variables, εt an (nε × 1) vector of innovations
to those elements of xt that are exogenous to the model, and st follows an N-state Markov
chain. The example considered in the previous subsection is a special case of such a system

36

with ny = nx = 1, yt = Pt /Dt , xt = ln(Dt /Dt−1 ), θst = mst , and4
a(yt+1 , yt , xt , xt−1 , εt+1 , εt , mst+1 , mst ) =




 β exp[(1 + γ)(mst+1 + εt+1 )][(yt+1 + 1)/yt ] − 1 

.


xt − mst − εt

For that example we were able to ﬁnd closed-form solutions of the form
yt = ρst (xt−1 , εt )
xt = hst (xt−1 , εt ),
namely yt = ρst and xt = mst + εt .

For more complicated models, solutions cannot be found analytically but can be approximated using the partition perturbation method developed by Foerster, et al. (forthcoming). Their method generalizes the now-standard perturbation methods of Schmitt-Grohe
and Uribe (2004) for ﬁnding linear and higher-order approximations to the solutions to
DSGE’s with no regime switching.

Foerster, et al.’s idea is to approximate the solutions

ρj (.) and hj (.) in a neighborhood around the deterministic steady-state values satisfying
a(y∗ , y∗ , x∗ , x∗ , 0, 0, θ∗ , θ ∗ ) = 0 where θ∗ is the unconditional expectation of θst calculated
from the ergodic probabilities of the Markov chain,
θ∗ =

For the Lucas tree example from the previous subsection, m∗ = (m1 p21 + m2 p12 )/(p12 + p21 ).
We then think of a sequence of economies indexed by a continuous scalar χ such that their
behavior as χ → 0 approaches the steady state, while the value at χ = 1 is exactly that
implied by (39):
yt = ρst (xt−1 , εt , χ)

(40)

xt = hst (xt−1 , εt , χ).

(41)

As χ → 0, the randomness coming from εt is suppressed, and it turns out to be necessary
to do the same thing for any elements of θ that inﬂuence the steady state in order to have
some ﬁxed point around which to calculate the approximation. For elements in θst that may
change with regime but do not matter for the steady state, Foerster, et al. (forthcoming)
showed that it is not necessary to shrink by χ in order to approximate the dynamic solution.
The authors thus speciﬁed

where F (εt+1 ) denotes the cumulative distribution function for εt+1 . Note (42) is satisﬁed
by construction when evaluated at yt = y∗ , xt = xt−1 = x∗ , εt = 0, χ = 0.

38

We next substitute (40) and (41) into (42) to arrive at a system of N (ny + nx ) equations
of the form
Qst (xt−1 , εt , χ) = 0

st = 1, ..., N

which have to hold for all xt−1 , εt , and χ. Taking derivatives with respect to xt−1 and
evaluating at xt−1 = x∗ , εt = 0, and χ = 0 (that is, using a ﬁrst-order Taylor approximation
around the steady state) yields a system of N(ny + nx )nx quadratic polynomial equations
in the N(ny + nx )nx unknowns corresponding to elements of the matrices

j = 1, ..., N.

The authors proposed an algorithm for ﬁnding the solution to this system of equations, that
is, values for the above sets of matrices. Given these, other terms in the ﬁrst-order Taylor
approximation to (42) produce a system of N (ny + nx )nε equations that are linear in known
parameters and the unknown elements of

j = 1, ..., N.
39

The approximation to the solution to the regime-switching DSGE is then
yt = y∗ + Rxst (xt−1 − x∗ ) + Rεst εt + Rχst
xt = x∗ + Hxst (xt−1 − x∗ ) + Hεst εt + Hχst .
One could then go a step further if desired, taking a second-order Taylor approximation
to (42). Once the ﬁrst step (the linear approximation) has been completed, the second
step (quadratic approximation) is actually easier to calculate numerically than the ﬁrst step
was, because all the second-step equations turn out to be linear in the remaining unknown
magnitudes.
Lind (2014) developed an extension of this approach that could be used to form approximations to any model characterized by dramatic nonlinearities, even if regime-switching in
the form of (39) is not part of the maintained structure. For example, the economic relations
may change signiﬁcantly when interest rates are at the zero lower bound. Lind’s idea is to
approximate the behavior of a nonlinear model over a set of discrete regions using relations
that are linear (or possibly higher order polynomials) over individual regions, from which
one can then use many of the tools discussed above for economic and econometric analysis.

3.3

Linear rational expectations models with changes in regime.

Economic researchers often use a linear special case of (39) which in the absence of regime
shifts takes the form
AE(yt+1 |Ωt ) = d + Byt + Cxt
xt = c + Φxt−1 + vt
40

(43)

for yt an (ny × 1) vector of endogenous variables, Ωt = {yt , yt−1 , ..., y1 }, xt an (nx × 1) vector
of exogenous variables, and vt a martingale diﬀerence sequence. Such a system might have
been obtained as an approximation to the ﬁrst-order conditions for a nonlinear DSGE using
the standard perturbation algorithm, or often is instead simply postulated as the primitive
conditions of the model of interest. If A−1 exists and the number of eigenvalues of A−1 B
whose modulus is less than or equal to unity is equal to the number of predetermined
endogenous variables, then a unique stable solution can be found of the form5
kt+1 = hk0 + Hkk kt + Hkx xt
dt = hd0 + Hdk kt + Hdx xt
where kt denotes the elements of yt that correspond to predetermined variables while dt
collects the control or jump variables. Algorithms for ﬁnding the values of the parameters
hi0 and Hij have been developed by Blanchard and Kahn (1980), Klein (2000), and Sims
(2001).
We could also generalize (43) to allow for changes in regime,
Ast E(yt+1 |Ωt , st , st−1 , ..., s1 ) = dst +Bst yt + Cst xt

(44)

where st follows an exogenous N -state Markov chain and Aj denotes an (ny × ny ) matrix of
parameters when the regime for date t is given by st = j. To solve such a model, Davig and
Leeper (2007) suggested exploiting the feature that conditional on S = {st }∞
t=1 the model is
linear. Let yjt correspond to the value of yt when st = j and collect the set of such vectors
5

Klein (2000) generalized to the case when A may not be invertible.

This is a simple regime-independent system for which a solution can be found using the
traditional method.

For example, with no predetermined variables, if all eigenvalues of

A−1 B are outside the unit circle, then we can ﬁnd a unique stable solution of the form

(Nny ×1)

=

h

(Nny ×1)

(49)

for hi and Hi the ith blocks of h and H, respectively. If (48) is a solution to (46), then (49)

43

is a solution to (44).6
However, Farmer, Waggoner, and Zha (2010) demonstrated that while (48) yields one
stable solution to (44), it need not be the only stable solution. For further discussion see
Farmer, Waggoner and Zha (2009).

3.4

Multiple equilibria.

Other economists have argued that models in which there are multiple possible solutions—
for example, system (43) with no predetermined variables and an eigenvalue of A−1 B inside
the unit circle— are precisely those we should be most interested in, given the perception that
sometimes consumers or ﬁrms seem to become highly pessimistic for no discernible reason,
bringing the economy into a self-fulﬁlling downturn; see Benhabib and Farmer (1999) for a
survey of this literature. One factor that could produce multiple equilibria is coordination
6

If (49) holds, then
N

E(yt+1 |Ωt , st = i) =

pij [hj + Hj (c + Φxt )].
j=1

Thus for (44) to hold it must be the case that for each i = 1, ..., N,
N

pij Hj Φ = Bi Hi + Ci

Ai
j=1
N

Ai
j=1

pij (hj + Hj c) = di + Bi hi .

But if (48) is a solution to (46), then
A[h + H(c + Φxt )] = d + B(h + Hxt ) + Cxt
block i of which requires from (47) that
(p′i ⊗ Ai )HΦ = Bi Hi + Ci
(p′i ⊗ Ai )(h + Hc) = di + Bi hi
as were claimed to hold.

externalities.

The rewards to me of participating in a market may be greatest when I

expect large numbers of others to do the same (Cooper and John, 1988; Cooper, 1994).
Multiple equilibria could also arise when expectations themselves are a factor determining
the equilibrium (Kurz and Motolese, 2001). Kirman (1993) and Chamley (1999) discussed
mechanisms by which the economy might tend to oscillate periodically between the possible
regimes in multiple-equilibria settings.
A widely studied example is ﬁnancial market bubbles. In the special case of risk-neutral
investors (that is, when U ′ (C) is some constant independent of consumption C), equation
(38) relating the price of the stock Pt to its future dividend Dt+1 becomes
Pt = βEt (Pt+1 + Dt+1 ).

(50)

One solution to (50) is the market-fundamentals solution given by
Pt∗ =

∞

β j Et (Dt+j ).

j=1

But Pt = Pt∗ + Bt also satisﬁes (50) for Bt any bubble process satisfying Bt = βEt Bt+1 .
Hall, Psaradakis and Sola (1999) proposed an empirical test of whether an observed ﬁnancial
price is occasionally subject to such a bubble regime. This test has been applied in dozens
of diﬀerent empirical studies.

However, Hamilton (1985), Driﬃll and Sola (1998), and

Gürkaynak (2008) noted the inherent diﬃculties in distinguishing ﬁnancial bubbles from
unobserved fundamentals.

45

3.5

Tipping points and ﬁnancial crises.

In other models, there may be a unique equilibrium but under the right historical conditions,
a small change in fundamentals can produce a huge change in observed outcomes.

Such

dynamics might be well-described as locally linear processes that periodically experience
changes in regime. Investment dynamics constitute one possible transmission mechanism.
The right sequence of events can end up triggering a big investment decline that in turn
contributes to a dramatic drop in output and an eﬀective change in regime. Acemoglu and
Scott (1997) presented a model where this happens as a result of intertemporal increasing
returns, for example, if an investment that leads to a signiﬁcant new discovery makes additional investments more proﬁtable for a short time. Moore and Schaller (2002), Guo, Miao,
and Morelle (2005), and Veldkamp (2005) examined diﬀerent settings in which investment
dynamics contribute to tipping points, often through a process of learning about current
opportunities. Startz (1998) demonstrated how an accumulation of small shocks could under certain circumstances trigger a dramatic shift between alternative production technologies. Learning by market participants introduces another possible source of tipping-point
or regime-shift dynamics (Hong, Stein, and Yu, 2007; Branch and Evans, 2010). Gârleanu,
Panageas and Yu (2015) demonstrated how tipping points could emerge from the interaction
of limited market integration, leveraging, and contagion.
Brunnermeier and Sannikov (2014) developed an intriguing description of tipping points
in the context of ﬁnancial crises. They posited two types of agents, designated “experts”
and “households”.

Experts can invest capital more productively than households, but

46

they are constrained to borrow using only risk-free debt.
economy’s equity ends up being held by experts.

In normal times, 100% of the

But as negative shocks cause their net

worth to decline, they can end up selling oﬀ capital to less productive households, lowering
both output and investment.

This results in a bimodal stationary distribution in which

the economy spends most of its time around the steady state in which experts hold all the
capital.

But a sequence of negative shocks can lead the economy to become stuck in an

ineﬃcient equilibrium from which it can take a long time to recover.
A large number of researchers have used regime-switching models to study ﬁnancial
crises empirically. These include Hamilton’s (2005) description of banking crises in the 19th
century, Asea and Blomberg’s (1998) study of lending cycles in the late 20th century, and
an investigation of more recent ﬁnancial stress by Hubrich and Tetlow (2015).

3.6

Currency crises and sovereign debt crises.

A sudden loss of conﬁdence in a country can lead to a ﬂight from the currency which in turn
produces a shock to credit and spending that greatly exacerbates the country’s problems. A
sudden wave of pessimism could be self-fulﬁlling, giving rise to multiple equilibria that could
exhibit Markov switching (Jeanne and Masson, 2000), or could be characterized by tipping
point dynamics where under the right circumstances a small change in fundamentals pushes
a country into crisis.

Empirical investigations of currency crises using regime-switching

models include Peria (2002) and Cerra and Saxena (2005).
Similar dynamics can characterize yields on sovereign debt. If investors lose conﬁdence
in a country’s ability to service its debt, they will demand a higher interest rate as compen47

sation. The higher interest costs could produce a tipping point that indeed forces a country
into default or to make drastic ﬁscal adjustments (Greenlaw, et al., 2013).

Analyses of

changes in regime in this context include Davig, Leeper, and Walker (2011) and Bi (2012).

3.7

Changes in policy as the source of changes in regime.

Another source of a change in regime is a discrete shift in policy itself.

One commonly

studied possibility is that control of monetary policy may periodically shift between hawks
and doves, the latter being characterized by either a higher inﬂation target or more willingness to tolerate deviations of inﬂation from target. Analyses using this approach include
Owyang and Ramey (2004), Schorfheide (2005), Liu, Waggoner, and Zha (2011), Bianchi
(2013), and Baele, et al. (2015).
An alternative possibility is that changes in ﬁscal regime can be a destabilizing factor.
Ruge-Murcia (1995) showed how a lack of credibility of the ﬁscal stabilization in 1984 contributed to the changes in inﬂation Israel experienced, while Ruge-Murcia (1999) documented
the close connection between changes in ﬁscal regimes and inﬂation regimes for Brazil.

Conclusions and recommendations for researchers.

We have seen that researchers have a rich set of tools and speciﬁcations on which to draw
for interpreting data and building economic models for environments in which there may be
changes in regime. The chapter closes with some practical recommendations for researchers
as to which options are most promising.
Although a researcher might be tempted to use the most general speciﬁcation possible,

48

with all the parameters changing across a large number of regimes and time-varying transition probabilities, in practice this is usually asking more than the data can deliver. For
example, for postwar U.S. data we have only 11 recessions, which economic theory says
should be diﬃcult or impossible to predict (Hamilton, 2011). Building a richly parameterized description of the transition into and out of recession could easily result in an overﬁtted
and misspeciﬁed model. By contrast, using a simple time-invariant Markov chain is likely
to give a reasonable and robust approximation to the key features of the data. Similarly, we
know from the analytic characterization of the maximum likelihood estimates (e.g., equation 24) that inference about parameters that only show up in regime i can only come from
observations within that regime. With postwar quarterly data that would mean about 50
observations from which to estimate all the parameters operating during recessions. One or
two parameters could be estimated fairly well, but overﬁtting is again a potential concern
in models with many parameters. For this reason researchers may want to limit the focus
to a few of the most important parameters that are likely to change, such as the intercept
and the variance.
Where more than two regimes are required, there again are beneﬁts to keeping the model
parsimonious. For example, a common ﬁnding is that the variance of U.S. output growth
permanently decreased in 1984 (McConnell and Perez-Quiros, 2000) while the intercept periodically shifts to negative during recessions. This requires 4 diﬀerent regimes— the economy
could be in expansion or recession and the date could be before or after the Great Moderation. A useful simpliﬁcation treats the variance regime as independent of the recession

49

regime, requiring estimation of only 4 transition probabilities rather than 12, as in Kim and
Nelson (1999b).
Another feature of which researchers should be aware is that there can be multiple local
maxima to the likelihood function. It is therefore good practice to begin the EM iterations
from a large number of diﬀerent starting points to make sure we are always ending up
with the same answer, and also as a practical test of whether the algorithm has indeed
converged to a ﬁxed point. Likewise with Bayesian methods we want to make sure numerical
algorithms converge to the same posterior distribution under alternative starting points and
chain dynamics, and the procedure should take into account the label-switching problem.
Provided researchers make note of these issues, these approaches oﬀer a ﬂexible way of
modeling some of the key nonlinearities in macroeconomic dynamics without sacriﬁcing the
simplicity and tractability of linear models.

Appendix: Derivation of EM equations for restricted VAR.
As noted by Hamilton (1990, p. 47), the M or maximization step of the EM algorithm
can be implemented by ﬁnding the ﬁrst-order conditions associated with maximizing the
likelihood conditional on a particular set of realizations for the regimes S = {s1 , ..., sT } and
then weighting these by the smoothed probability of S and summing over all the possible
realizations of S. For a VAR restricted as in (28), the conditional likelihood is

where δ(st = i) denotes unity if st = i and zero otherwise. Stacking (51)-(52) horizontally
gives

Multiplying the tth term within the sums in (54) and (53) by Prob(st = i|ΩT ; λ̂ ), summing
over i = 1, ..., N and rearranging gives equations (29) and (30).

correspond to NBER recession dates which were not used in any way in constructing the
probabilities. Prior to 2005, each point on the graph corresponds to a simulated real-time
