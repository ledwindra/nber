Costs and Benefits to Phasing Out Paper Currency
Kenneth S. Rogoff
NBER Working Paper No. 20126
May 2014
JEL No. E41,E51,E52
ABSTRACT
Despite advances in transactions technologies, paper currency still constitutes a notable percentage
of the money supply in most countries. For example, it constitutes roughly 10% of the US Federal
Reserve’s main monetary aggregate, M2. Yet, it has important drawbacks. First, it can help facilitate
activity in the underground (tax-evading) and illegal economy. Second, its existence creates the artifact
of the zero bound on the nominal interest rate. On the other hand, the enduring popularity of paper
currency generates many benefits, including substantial seigniorage revenue. This paper explores
some of the issues associated with phasing out paper currency, especially large-denomination notes.

Paper currency has two very distinct properties that should draw our attention.
First, it is precisely the existence of paper currency that makes it difficult for central
banks to take policy interest rates much below zero, a limitation that seems to have
become increasingly relevant during this century. As Blanchard et al. (2010) point out,
today’s environment of low and stable inflation rates has drastically pushed down the
general level of interest rates. The low overall level, combined with the zero bound,
means that central banks cannot cut interest rates nearly as much as they might like in
response to large deflationary shocks.
If all central bank liabilities were electronic, paying a negative interest on
reserves (basically charging a fee) would be trivial. But as long as central banks stand
ready to convert electronic deposits to zero-interest paper currency in unlimited amounts,
it suddenly becomes very hard to push interest rates below levels of, say, -0.25 to -0.50
percent, certainly not on a sustained basis. Hoarding cash may be inconvenient and risky,
but if rates become too negative, it becomes worth it. 3
In a series of insightful papers, Willem Buiter (2009 and citations therein) has
discussed whether it might be possible to find devices for paying negative interest rates
on currency. 4 Buiter notes that there were experiments with stamp taxes during the Great
Depression (currency would remain valid only if it were regularly stamped to reflect tax
payment). There are a variety of other ideas. For example, Mankiw (2009) points out that
the central bank could effectively tax currency by holding lotteries based on serial
numbers, and making the “winners” worthless.
3

Of course, central banks can and do impose required reserves at sub-market interest rates as a
tax on banks. The problem is when the implied interest rates for depositors turn negative.
4

Buiter (2009) credits Gesell (1916) as the first to moot the idea of taxing currency.

Paying a negative interest rate on currency, or on electronic reserves at the central
bank, may seem barbaric to some. But it is arguably no more barbaric than inflation,
which similarly reduces the real purchasing power of currency. The idea of raising target
inflation to reduce the likelihood of hitting the zero bound is indeed an alternative
approach. Blanchard et al. point out that if central banks permanently raised their target
inflation rates from 2% to 4%, it would leave them scope to make deeper cuts to real
interest rates in severe downturns. Arguably, paying negative interest rates is a better
approach if, as many believe, inflation becomes more unstable as the general level of
inflation rises. Robert Hall (1983) argues forcefully that the central role of monetary
policy should be to provide a stable unit of account, and in principle the ability to pay
negative interest rates facilitates its ability to achieve this in today’s low inflation
environment (Hall, 2002, 2012).
Even if there is a good case for allowing the central bank to pay a significant
negative interest rate to fight a large deflationary shock, what is to stop a government
from using negative interest rates as a wealth tax in normal times? This is a complex
issue that parallels many of the problems in trying to design central bank institutions that
will resist the temptation to inflate. Nevertheless, the challenges of conducting monetary
policy at the zero bound force consideration of alternatives to the status quo. If, as
Reinhart and Rogoff (2014) conjecture, business and financial cycles in the 21st century
may produce larger fluctuations than they did in the last part of the 20th century, the issue
of hitting the zero bound may indeed remain a recurrent one.

Anonymous money as a vehicle for facilitating tax evasion and illegal activity

2

We now turn to a second drawback to paper currency. Paper currency facilitates
making transactions anonymous, helping conceal activities from the government in a way
that might help agents avoid laws, regulations and taxes. This is a big difference from
most forms of electronic money that, in principle, can be traced by the government. (We
discuss the issue of substitute anonymous transactions vehicles such as Bitcoin, later on.)
Standard monetary theory (e.g., Kiyotaki and Wright 1989) suggests that an
essential property of money is that neither buyer nor seller requires knowledge of its
history, giving it a certain form of anonymity. (A slight caveat is that the identity of the
buyer might be correlated with the probability of the currency being counterfeit, but until
now this is a problem that governments have been able to contain.) There is nothing,
however, in standard theories of money that requires transactions to be anonymous from
tax- or law-enforcement authorities. And yet there is a significant body of evidence that a
large percentage of currency in most countries, generally well over 50%, is used precisely
to hide transactions. I have summarized the international evidence in earlier research
(Rogoff 1998, 2002). Other than the introduction of the euro, rather little has changed
except that, if anything, anonymous currencies have continued to grow at a faster rate
than nominal GDP.
Given that banks and businesses are typically quite efficient in their cash
management (as evidenced by several central bank surveys), the most surprising fact
about currency is the sheer extant amount that most OECD countries have in circulation,
far in excess of anything that can be traced to legal use in the domestic economy. Table 1
gives data on currency by denomination and as a share of GDP for the United States, the
Eurozone, Japan and Hong Kong. For example, as of March 2013, there was almost 1.3

3

trillion dollars in US currency in circulation, or roughly $4,000 for every man, woman
and child living in the United States. Moreover, nearly 78% of the total value is in $100
bills, meaning more than thirty $100 bills per person. By contrast, denominations of $10
and under accounted for less than 4% of the total value of currency in use.
The size of dollar currency holdings, relative to GDP or per capita, is hardly
unique. Indeed, in the US the currency supply is 7% of GDP, in the Eurozone 10%, and
in Japan 18%. Despite having lower per capita income, the Eurozone also has roughly
$4,000 in euros for every one of its citizen (valued at the April 2014 euro–dollar
exchange rate). The euro has a much greater range of high denominations, so the value is
not as concentrated in a single denomination as in the United States. Nevertheless, the
same basic phenomenon holds, with roughly a third of the value of euro currency held in
50 euro notes (roughly $70), and another third in 500 euro notes (roughly $700). Adding
in 100 and 200 euro notes brings the percent of high-denomination notes close to that of
the US. In Japan, the total amount of currency outstanding is similar to that in the United
States and Europe, despite having a population size only 40% as large. The concentration
in the highest denomination is even more acute, with 87% of the value of notes being in
10,000 yen notes, the largest denomination, roughly $100 at April 2014 exchange rates. 5
It is true that in the case of the US and the euro area, there is fairly convincing
evidence that a large share is held abroad. Porter and Judson (1996) use seasonal
comparisons with Canada and biometric techniques to infer that roughly 70% of US
currency is held abroad. It should be noted that Canada is a country that has relatively
low currency use compared to many other advanced countries. However, the fact that
Rogoff (1998, 2002) looks at a wide range of OECD countries, and indeed the US does not particularly
stand out as having high per capita GDP currency holdings.

5

4

currency outstanding is comparable to the US in so many other OECD countries, most of
whose currencies are used only domestically, suggests that perhaps the size of currency
holdings in the US is similarly quite large; Rogoff (1998) speculates that the ratio of US
currency held internationally may be closer to 50%. Of course, as interest rates have
fallen to near zero in recent years, it is not surprising that the demand for currency in the
domestic US economy appears to have risen; using similar techniques to her earlier work,
Judson (2012) estimates around 50% of US dollars are held domestically post financial
crisis. Even if foreign holdings of currency are important for a few countries (including
also Hong Kong and Switzerland), this is not thought to be the case for most OECD
countries. The Japanese yen does not appear to be a significant international currency.
In any event, it is clear that the long-term trend domestic demand for currency in
the legal economy is dwindling, due in part to advances in cashless payments. 6 As
already noted, the small number of central bank surveys that have been performed to
measure domestic use of currency in the legal economy typically find very low
percentages, on the order of 10–15% of total extant currency in the case of the United
States (see also Feige 2012a, b). Cash is used more intensively in some Eurozone
countries. Fischer, Kőhler and Seitz (2004) use a wide range of methods to estimate the
transactions demand for currency within the euro area to be 25–35% of total euro
currency in circulation. This estimate is broadly in accord with European Central Bank
surveys taken after the financial crisis (ECB 2011) that reported holdings and demand for
euro in the legal domestic economy of roughly 1/3 of total euros outstanding. Of the
remainder, Bartzsch, Rősl and Seitz (2011) look at euro notes issued by the Bundesbank
Wang and Wolman (2014) use transaction-level data from a large discount chain to conclude
that the cash share of retail sales in the United States will decline by 2.54% per year.

6

5

and find that between 40 and 55% are held outside of Eurozone countries. (It is quite
possible that the overall level of euro notes held outside the Eurozone is lower, since
Bundesbank-issued notes are particularly popular, even if in principle all the Eurozone
central bank notes should be perfect substitutes.)
Presumably, currency that is not held in the domestic legal economy or in the
global economy (legal and underground) is mainly held in the domestic underground
economy. 7 The underground economy includes agents evading taxes, laws and
regulation. The size of the underground economy is not known within any precision,
though estimates for the US are on the order of 7–10% of GDP (e.g., IRS 2012, Feige
2012). The IRS estimates that for the benchmark year 2006, the tax gap (tax not paid
voluntarily) is over $450 billion, with a gap of $385 billion still remaining after tax
collection efforts. Importantly, this estimate does not include the informal economy (US
Treasury Inspector General 2013). In Europe, where taxes are higher and regulation is
often more onerous, most estimates suggest that the size of the underground economy is
considerably larger than in the US (see Schneider, Buehn and Montenegro 2010).
Summing up, currency should be becoming technologically obsolete. However,
in no small part due to its association with the underground economy, it is not.
Arguments against phasing out paper currency
The arguments for eliminating paper currency are impressive, but there are
important points on the other side of the equation. The most straightforward is
seigniorage. The United States money supply increased by an average of roughly $30

7 It is possible that survey respondents underreport even those cash holdings that are for completely
legitimate purposes, for example by individuals who simply do not trust banks. I am implicitly
assuming this is the not nearly as important quantitatively as cash holdings used to avoid taxes or to
engage in illegal activities.

6

billion per year from 2002–2007, and averaged roughly $70 billion dollars per year in
the years immediately following the financial crisis. The magnitudes are similar in many
other large advanced countries. If a phase-out of paper currency were simply met by an
increased demand for electronic central bank reserves, there would of course be no
significant loss. However, precisely because paper currency is anonymous, replacing it
with non-anonymous electronic money would likely lead to a large shrinkage in demand,
and Treasuries would have to absorb the loss. Rogoff (1998) conjectures that this cost
might be fully compensated if a modest fraction of the underground economy is induced
to pay taxes, and there are also of course potential gains from reduced law-enforcement
costs. It is unclear how easily these activities could substitute into other transactions
media, but presumably this could be made difficult by restricting other potential
anonymous transactions vehicles.
Of course, if the government simply replaced paper currency with electronic
currency that it could somehow credibly make anonymous, there would be not
necessarily any long-run shrinkage in demand. The government would continue to garner
seigniorage revenues from the underground economy and the problem of the zero bound
on nominal interest rates would be effectively eliminated. That said, it is far from clear
that the government can credibly issue a fully anonymous electronic currency and even if
it could, anonymous electronic fiat money has all the drawbacks of an anonymous paper
currency in facilitating tax evasion and illegal activity.
There is also a question of how forcing a more rapid shift to cashless payments
would affect transactions costs. Retailers are typically forced to pay a pro-rata fee to
companies such as MasterCard and Visa for credit card services. But handling paper

7

currency also entails substantial costs to protect against theft and pilferage. Also, in
principle, the Federal government could allow individuals to maintain ATMs and debit
cards at the Federal Reserve, and arguably these could be serviced by private
subcontractors at lower cost than conventional bank services.
Another important argument for maintaining the status quo is that eliminating a
core symbol of the monetary regime could disrupt common social conventions for using
money, possibly in unexpected ways. For example, it could lead to a precipitous decline
in demand for debt and not just for fiat money. This need not happen. In his hugely
influential book on monetary policy, Woodford (2003) shows that central bank
stabilization policy can work perfectly well in the limit as money’s role in transactions
goes to zero. As long as social price-setting convention remains, and as long as the
central bank can manipulate banks’ reserves to set the price level, monetary stabilization
policy can still operate with full force. However, one must be careful that just because a
similar equilibrium can obtain with or without a significant transactions role for money, it
does not necessarily mean that private agents will focus on the same equilibrium as they
would when there exists paper currency. Yes, the government can help coordinate
expectations by insisting that taxes are paid in the electronic fiat currency, and that all
state contracts be denominated in this currency. But it is important to acknowledge that
there is a least an outside risk that if the government is too abrupt is abandoning a
century-old social convention, it will destabilize inflation expectations, introduce a risk
premium into bond pricing, and generally induce unexpected macroeconomic
instabilities.

8

There is also a potential risk to central bank independence. Even if eliminating
currency is at least revenue neutral for the government as a whole, the central bank is the
one that will lose seigniorage revenue. The Treasury is the one that will correspondingly
gain through higher tax revenues and lower law-enforcement costs. Under longstanding
institutional relationships, the ability to self-finance has put central banks in a privileged
position. Although governments typically maintain oversight of central bank budgets, the
fact that the central bank nominally appears to be a “profit center” considerably
strengthens its hand in maintaining operational independence. In recent years,
quantitative easing has been a massive money maker, but this is not the normal state of
affairs when currency provision is a key source of revenue.
Another argument for maintaining paper currency is that it pays to have a
diversity of technologies and not to become overly dependent on an electronic grid that
may one day turn out to be very vulnerable. Paper currency diversifies the transactions
system and hardens it against cyber attack, EMP blasts, etc. This argument, however,
seems increasingly less relevant because economies are so totally exposed to these
problems anyway. With paper currency being so marginalized already in the legal
economy in many countries, it is hard to see how it could be brought back quickly,
particularly if ATM machines were compromised at the same time as other electronic
systems. 8
A different type of argument against eliminating currency relates to civil liberties.
In a world where society’s mores and customs evolve, it is important to tolerate
experimentation at the fringes. This is potentially a very important argument, though the
It is true that nearly all disaster-preparedness instructions recommend holding cash, though unless
individuals are following this advice, there would still need to be a mechanism for distributing
currency after a catastrophe.

problem might be mitigated if controls are placed on the government’s use of information
(as is done say with tax information), and the problem might also be ameliorated if small
bills continue to circulate. 9
Last but not least, if any country attempts to unilaterally reduce the use of its
currency, there is a risk that another country’s currency would be used within domestic
borders. Even if that risk is not great for a country like the United States, there is still the
loss of revenue from foreign users of currency (many of whom may be engaged in
underground or illegal activities within their own borders, even if not within US
borders). 10 Thus, any attempt to eliminate large-denomination currency would ideally be
taken up in a treaty that included at the very least the major global currencies.

Conclusions
Paper currency came into prominent worldwide use at the time of World War I,
and has played a major role in shaping the global history of the last 100 years. Despite
huge and ongoing technological advances in electronic transactions technologies, it has
remained surprisingly durable, even if its major uses seem to be buried in the world
underground and illegal economy. With many central banks now near or at the zero
interest rate bound, there are increasingly strong arguments for exploring how it might be
phased out of use. True, there are many arguments for not disturbing the status quo,
I am implicitly assuming that if only small bills remain in circulation, the central bank would still
have the practical capacity to lower interest rates to significantly more negative levels than if large
bills continue to circulate, since hoarding costs are much greater for any large sum.

9

Obviously, some foreign use of dollar and euro currency is beneficial to the local economies, even if
a significant share goes to facilitating illegal and underground activities. Thus, some countries may
consider it detrimental to their interests to see phasing out of dollar and euro paper currency.
However, in an era where inflation rates in most countries have fallen radically over the past two
decades (making local currencies more attractive), the benefits of being able to use dollar and euro
paper currency in the legal economy has presumably been falling, and will continue to do so.

10

10

ranging from the importance of seigniorage revenues to civil liberties arguments. Given
relentless technological advance, embodied in everything from mobile banking to
crytocurrencies, we may already live in the twilight of the paper currency era anyway,
Nevertheless, given the role of paper currency (especially large-denomination notes) in
facilitating tax evasion and illegal activity, and given the persistent and perhaps recurring
problem of the zero bound on nominal interest rates, it is appropriate to consider the costs
and benefits to a more proactive strategy for phasing out the use of paper currency.
