    "abstract": "\n\nNew Internet-based markets enable consumer/owners to rent out their durable goods when not using them. Such markets are modeled to determine ownership, rental rates, quantities, and surplus generated. Both the short run, before consumers can revise their ownership decisions, and the long run, in which they can, are examined to assess how these markets change ownership and consumption. The analysis examines bringing-to-market costs, such as labor costs and transaction costs, and considers the operating platform\u2019s pricing problem. A survey of consumers broadly supports the modeling assumptions employed. For example, ownership is determined by individuals\u2019 forward-looking assessments of planned usage.\n\n",
