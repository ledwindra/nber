    "abstract": "\n\nMost states (Vermont is the exception) have a constitutional or statutory limitation restricting their ability to run deficits in the state's general fund.  Balanced budget limitations may be either prospective or beginning-of-the-year requirements or retrospective or end-of-the-year requirements.  Using budget data from a panel of 47 U.S. states for the period 1970-1991, the analysis finds that states with end-of-the-year (not prospective) balance requirements enforced as constitutional (not statutory) constraints by an independently elected (not politically appointed) state supreme court do have significant positive effects on a state's general fund surplus.  The surplus is accumulated through cuts in spending, not through tax increases.  It is saved in a state `rainy day' fund in anticipation of future general fund deficits.  In contrast, prospective requirements, statutory end-of-the-year requirements, or constitutional end-of-the- year requirements enforced by a politically appointed court do not significantly constrain general fund deficit behavior.  Finally, we find little evidence that the constraints `force' deficits into other fiscal accounts.\n\n",
