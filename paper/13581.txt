Evaluating the Impure Chinese VAT Relative to a Pure Form in a Simple Monetary Trade
Model with an Endogenous Trade Surplus

NBER Working Paper No. 13581

JEL No. H2,O11
ABSTRACT
China’s VAT while seemingly conventional has two major impurities. One is that a separate export
rebate system exists where rebate rates are linked from rates paid on creditable inputs. The other is
the use of an income base for which there is no crediting of taxes on capital good, rather than the more
conventional consumption base with expensing of investment expenditures. Here we argue that in
a conventional competitive model both impurities would typically involve a welfare loss, but if we
use a numerical calibrated equilibrium model with a monetary structure capturing by these Chinese
features in which the trade surplus is endogenously determined and the exchange rate is exogenously
set, things are different. These impurities effectively act as added taxes on domestic production (lowed
export rebate rates, taxes on a larger VAT base) and tax exporting. Tax exporting reduces exports
which lowers the surplus and accumulation of foreign currency. In a static model, a reduced surplus
is welfare improving. Using 2002 data, we thus find that China’s impure VAT system yields welfare
gains in contrast to what a conventional model would show. These results are important since there
are arguments being made inside and outside China for changes to be made and move closer to a pure
VAT. Our results suggest that unless there are wider changes first in macro-structure, such changes
may not be welfare preferred.

1. Introduction

China since 1994 has had a Value Added Tax (VAT) which seems conventional by
international standards, but on closer inspection is nonstandard and impure in some
key areas. Export credits are not always given, and are used as a stabilization device
on an on/off basis in certain key sectors (textiles and apparel). The tax is
administrated on an income basis in most sectors, but on a consumption basis in such
areas as light industry. In addition, the tax is effectively restricted to manufacturing
level with a lower rate turnover tax on key service sectors.

Here we argue that in a conventional competitive monetary framework such features
of the VAT are distortionary and impose welfare costs. However, in a world of fixed
exchange rates, non accommodative monetary policy and endogenous trade deficits
(as currently in China), this need not be the case. We use a simple single period
monetary general equilibrium model with fixed exchange rates and endogenous trade
suplus which we calibrate to 2002 Chinese data and show the impure Chinese VAT to
be welfare improving compared to the classical neutral tax since it reduces the trade
surplus.

Essentially the argument advanced is that in classical public finance analysis of the
VAT, departures from a pure destination based consumption form would be regarded
as distortionary and imposing welfare costs. However, in a model where the trade
surplus is endogenously determined given the exchange rate and non accommodative
monetary policy, such policies may instead be welfare improving compared to a pure
VAT through these trade effects because they increase production costs for exports
and lower the size of the trade surplus. We also show how changes in export rebate
rates and exchange rate policy can be substitute instruments in terms of macro
impacts on trade flows. There effects can clearly be offset by others excluded from the
model. For instance, a labor leisure choice in a static model will change the analysis
of an income base versus a consumption base because with a larger base equal yield
2

rates will be lower under an income tax and distortions of labor supply reduced. We
concentrate only on the trade effects of the impure base and their intreaction with the
surplus.

We first discuss the Chinese VAT, as well as the two elements of impurities discussed
above. We set out how they operate and have evolved over time. Interactions with
trade performance and exchange rate policy are also highlighted. We then present a
monetized general equilibrium trade model in which the trade surplus is endogenously
determined given exchange rate and monetary policies. Production structures in the
model capture intermediate production and value added functions for a model
calibrated to 2002 Chinese data covering 10 sectors and capturing both China’s key
items of foreign trade and products/sectors where impurities in tax VAT treatment
arise both in export rebates and the use of an income basis. The model is then
calibrated to base case data for 2002 and generate a supporting parameterization for
trade, consumption, the trade surplus and production in the presence of VAT
impurities. We then compute an equilibrium in the absence of these impurities, by
moving to a pure VAT eitheringly or jointly. We show that relative to a pure VAT these
impurities allow for tax exporting effects which reduce the size of the surplus and
yield a welfare gain. We also show how a structure giving no rebates is equivalent to a
Renminbi revaluation, suggesting equivalence and interplay between these
instruments. The broader theme of the results is that particular features of policy
structure in China which may strike those versed in classical theory as odd may make
good sense given the overall policy system within which elements reside.

2. China’s impure VAT

China introduced the Value Added Tax (VAT) in 1994 as part of a general tax reform.
It replaced a preexisting cascading whole sale turnover tax, and was seen both at
home and abroad as a major improvement in terms of removing tax distortions and
3

providing a stable revenue source. The VAT has since emerged as the major and
secure revenue source underpinning the finances of the Chinese state. It has a standard
tax rate of 17%, which is largely restricted to manufactures and is supplemented by a
low rate (3%) turnover tax on key service items. The lower 13% rate applies to a
range of products (agriculture, vegetables, heating and natural gas, chemicals,
fertilizer, metals and coal, see Table 1 ).

China’s VAT is administered by the State Administration of Taxation (VAT on imports
is collected by customs) and VAT tax revenues shared between the central government
and local governments who receive roughly 25% of revenue. The VAT coexists at
enterprise level with a consumption tax whose rates range from 3-17% on all taxable
items, and a business tax at rates of 3-20% on taxable items, as well as enterprise
income taxes. These additional taxes apply to domestic sales and imports and cover
areas both where the VAT is difficult to collect and luxury oriented consumption items
such as cars. Among all Chinese taxes, the VAT is the most important revenue source.

The Chinese VAT, however, has evolved in ways which are quite different from VATs
elsewhere, being used both as a stabilization device and an incentive mechanism for
policy objectives such as location of firms and area of economic activity (such as high
technology products). Specifically, though the tax is formally administered (as in most
countries) on a destination basis, rebates of input taxes are variable by sector and
commodity, and also used in an on/off manner for stabilization purposes. This is
especially the case in the textiles and clothing sector where export tax credits are
terminated periodically when export growth rates are seen as too high, and become
the source of international pressure. One of China’s actions following the termination
of the Multi Fiber Arrangement (MFA) in 2005 was to reduce export rebates as a way
of slowing the export surge of newly quota free products to the US and other
developed country markets. China has announced policy of limited export rebates for
VAT which varies by product and which change over time as in 2003, 2005 and more
recently in 2006.

The tax is also administered on an income base which does not allow the expensing of
purchases of capital goods. This contrasts with the consumption base used in most
other countries under which expensing is allowed. Recent tax changes have
introduced elements of a consumption basis by region and by sector, and so now a
mixture of the two bases operates.

Earlier VAT literature on a switch from destination to origin taxation shows such
switch at given tax rates may have no real effects because adjustments of exchange
rate and price levels may offset tax effects (Whalley, 1979;

Krugman, 1980;

5

Grossman,1980). Substituting the origin principle (tax on exports, no tax on imports)
for the destination principle (tax on import, no tax on export) thus should have no
affects on real trade. Since a tax on exports is equivalent to a tax on imports,
compensating exchange rate and price level adjustments simply restore the original
equilibrium. Generally, full price flexibility in a competitive economy, is taken to
imply that a comprehensive uniform-rate VAT and yields this equivalence in practice.
Lockwood (Lockwood etal., 1994a, 1994b) extend his analysis to imperfect
competitive economy, money economy and when transport cost is taken into account.
They find, under assumptions that are different from the earlier literature, that
nonequivalence may applies and distortionary policies can influence the economy in
various ways.

Besides this equivalence, literature also notes that the administration of the origin
principle is difficult. If exports are to be taxed, export values must be verified to
ensure that all domestic value added is included in the base. Arm’s length pricing
rules from the application of separate accounting principles under the corporate
income tax would have to be adopted. National tax credits, would have to be attached
to imports at amounts equal to the product of the domestic VAT rate and arm’s length
import values to ensure that they would not be taxed in domestic stages of production
or distribution. Thus, in contrast to the assumptions made in earlier literature, the
proper treatment of exports and imports under the origin principle seemingly requires
the maintenance or re-establishment of border controls.

Equally, tax effects of the VAT are typically analyzed assuming that the trade balance
is exogenous if international trade is taken into account. The unrealism of this
assumption in the Chinese case is especially troublesome since trade balance is a
major element in the structure and reflects exchange rate and monetary policies. Here
we start from the classical neutrality literature Whalley (Whalley, 1979) and
Lockwood (Lockwood, 1994a, 1994b) and introduce monetary non neutralities in
analyzing how under a fixed exchange regime, when the trade surplus is
6

endogenously determined, features of VAT structure traditionally regarded as impure
can nonetheless be welfare preferred.

3

Export Rebates

The first impurity in China’s VAT that we discuss are limits placed on the rebate of
input tax credits as they relate to exports. Exports are zero rated as in conventional
VATs, but export rebates of inputs credits are restricted in various ways and rebate
rates differ from statutory rates. There are both general policies by product and sector
(which change over time) as to the amount of rebate allowed, and specific responses
to trade pressures from importing countries (as in apparel) that temporarily suspend
rebates.

The origins of this system lie in the 1994 introduction of the VAT when full rebates
were planned and the government earmarked a certain amount of revenue for rebates.
Due to sharp export growth, and bogus invoices and rebate claims, much of the
claimed 1994 rebates had to be deferred. In 1995, the government budget could again
not cover requested rebates (which were double the budget ), and the government
changed the rebate rate. The rebate rate was set at 14% on items taxable at 17%, 10%
for items taxable at 13%, and 3% on a small range of items. A year later the
government once again could not cover the requested rebates, and rebate rates fell
further to 10% from 14% and to 6% from 10%. Table 2 lists refund rates currently
used in China.

Between 1991 and 1995, rebates accounted for 7%-10.5% of government
expenditures. The growth rate of export rebates in 1996 was 50.5% in part due to
rapid export growth from foreign invested enterprises, but also due to fraud and
invalid VAT invoices. The share of VAT revenues going to local governments (who
did not contribute to rebates before 2003) compounded the problem.

Also, as China’s exports grew in the late 1990’s, and the share of processing trade

8

involving imported components also grew, more than half of China’s exports came
from export processing zones where imports entered both duty free and free of VAT.
This created a strong incentive for local firms to convert to processing trade from
general trade, since they were still eligible for export rebates. These fiscal problems of
processing trade, tax revenue assignment to local governments, and false involves
again forced the central government to limit export tax rebates.

Export rebates have thus evolved in ways which are unrelated to input taxes paid on
materials as in a conventional credit-invoice VAT, and schedules of allowable rebates
are announced which are changed from time to time. These are then supplemented by
ad hoc product specific announcements to change or terminate rebates usually as a
result of pressure (actual or perceived ) to slow export growth to key markets abroad.

These refunds work in the following way. The enterprise first pays VAT to the
government ignoring that export products. Each enterprise engaged in export activity
calculates its VAT liabilities as

Ti = tS i − tM i − Ri
where Ti are taxes payable, t is the VAT rate, S i are sales of enterprise i, M i are
material inputs of firm i, and Ri is the refundable VAT on exports sales. Refunds, in
turn, are calculated as:

Ri = Ei ri
where E i are export sales, ri is the refund rate (as per cent in Table 2). t ≥ ri ≥ 0,
and if ri =0 no refund on all export sales applies. This rebate differs from a credit
invoice VAT in applying to the full value of exports, not just the material input
component, but if added materials are used to produce export non export VAT is
correspondingly reduced.
9

The net result of this structure is a series of export rebates at varying rates across
products and sectors which are little connected to the taxes paid on material inputs,
with effects both on trade patterns and trade volumes. And in a model with monetary
non neutralities the endogenously determined trade surplus is affected, and changes in
rebate rates can be partial substitute instruments for exchange rate realignment. This
latter linkage has been much discussed in China.

The second element of impurity in the Chinese VAT relates to the use of an income
basis for the tax in contrast to the more conventional consumption base used in most
countries, where capital good purchases are expensed under the VAT. Fixed assets for
Chinese VAT purposes include machines and transport equipment; effectively all
capital equipment used in production regardless of whether the equipment was
imported or purchased domestically. This implies input taxes apply to capital goods
through the production process.

This treatment is however in transition. In January 2004 a pilot program was launched
covering 8 sectors (including oil, chemical and autos) in 3 provinces (Heilongjiang,
Jilin and Liaoning) to evaluate the application of VAT on a consumption basis by
allowing deductions for capital goods. Also, as part of 11th 5-year-plan in 2005, VAT
input credits for capital goods are extended to the production of high technology
goods. A mixed income/consumption basis is thus evolving. Both of these impurities
represent a considerable departure from a classical pure form of VAT.

4.

Modeling the effects

We first discuss the impacts of changes in VAT structure in standard classical models,
and then subsequently discuss models which depart from this form by explicitly
capturing monetary non-neutralities and allowing for the endogenous determination of
the trade surplus. In this latter class of models, tax structures which reduce exports
10

will tend to reduce the surplus, and this reduces central bank accumulation of foreign
currency to support a fixed exchange rate (with inconvertibility). This will be welfare
improving in a static model. While simple, this formulation is clearly closer to the
contemporary situation in China and in such a model an impure VAT may dominate a
pure VAT by generating a smaller trade surplus. Thus, given China’s current macro
policy posture, an impure VAT may dominate a pure VAT.

4.1

The standard classical case

In a classical world it is relatively easy to demonstrate the neutrality of either a
consumption (destination) or origin ( production ) broadly based VAT levied at a
single rate. For simplicity, we can consider 2 countries with 2 producers and 2 factors.

The production function for each good in each country can be written as

Yi = g i ( K i , Li )

If we then consider a monetized extension of this model where prices are
denominated in terms of domestic currency with an exchange rate e between the two
domestic moneys, then cross country arbitrage between the country specific prices
with no tax distortion in trade yields:

pi = epi

where M

is the money stock in country j.

In this model, money is neutral in the sense that once domestic money stocks are
specified, then an equilibrium exchange rate is determined independently of the real
side. If instead e is fixed at e , then the relative domestic money stocks m i / m j need
to accommodate to e so as to support it as an equilibrium exchange rate.

The neutrality of movements between a broadly based VAT administered on a
destination (consumption) or origin (production) basis, or indeed between no VAT and
∧

a VAT for this economy follows directly. If we define
j

good i in country j and pi

pi

as the consumer price of

p i = (1 + t ) p i

In the origin case, if all pi

j

fall by

, or if e increases by (1+t), the same
1+ t

equilibrium will prevail both in a no tax case, and under an origin or destination basis
tax. Taxes and their bases are neutral in effect.

4.2

Non accommodative monetary policy, and fixed exchange rate case

If, however, as in China the monetary regime is non accommodative to the fixed
exchange rate chosen and the surplus (and accumulation of reserves) are
endogenously determined the neutrality propositions above for broadly based taxes
breakdown. In this case, an impure VAT can be welfare preferred to a pure VAT. This
can occur, for example, if for a given statutory rate there is a smaller surplus
associated with the impure VAT compared to the pure VAT.

To analyze this case, we assume a fixed exchange rate e chosen by country 1 who is
willing to support the rate with reserve accumulation which implies trade surpluses.
We thus assume that monetary policy in countries 1 and 2 as represented by

m1 / m 2

is non-accomodative of e , and a trade surplus (deficit) results in country 1 ( 2 ).

In this case, the budget constraints for each country in the no tax case are given by

where S 1 represents the endogenously determined trade surplus in 1 in the currency

1

i

And the corresponding trade deficit D 2 in country 2 is:
D 2 = ∑ pi M i −∑ pi Ei
2

2

2

i

2

(13)

i

In equilibrium, S 1 = D 2 , and in this case, money demand functions change to reflect
the surplus and become

∑p

i

∑p

i

1

1

X i =m

2

X i + S j =m

1

i

2

2

i

The surplus thus is accommodated in the model by the central bank in country i
accumulating currency of i equal to S i (= eS j ).

In this world, a consumption based VAT will be similar to the classical case in that
arbitrage across countries will still imply that
∧

p i = e(1 + t ) p i
∧

pi

1

2

p
= i
e

2

(imports taxed)

(15)

1

(export not taxed)

and so no adjustment is needed in either p i

j

or e to achieve the same equilibrium.

However, a tax structure that reduces S will typically be welfare preferred for country
j, and so an impure VAT in these cases can yield welfare benefits.

The case of a production (origin) based VAT will also no longer be equivalent to a
destination basis VAT on consumption. In these cases, the international arbitrage
conditions are as before, that is:
∧

p i = ep i
1

2

import (not taxed)

(16)

15

∧

pi

2

(1 + t ) pi
=

1

export (taxed in country j)

Here equivalence can no longer be obtained by adjustments only in either p i
1

p i were to change by

e . If all

change all Y i

j

j

or in

1
, then S would have to change which would
1+ t

j

and X i , or e increase by (1+t). Equally changing p i

j

by (1+t) ,

would require a change in S j ( D 2 ).

The impure VAT can be modeled directly using a fixed coefficient technology β ai

j

which represents the use of good a in the production of good i in country j.

In this case, the zero profit conditions for good i in country j become
pi = wl i + ( ri − δ i ) k i + ∑ β ai p a
j

j

rate of return on capital across sectors in country i (capital is assumed immobile

conditions
∧

p i = (1 + t )( wl i + (ri − δ i )k i ) + ∑ β ai p a
j

j

j

j

j

j

If we treat the lack of input credits on capital pure purchases as equivalent to allowing
no deduction for depreciation from the gross return on capital, taxes on value added of

p i = (1 + t ) wl i + (ri (1 + t ) − δ i )k i + ∑ β ai p a
j

j

j

j

j

j

j

16

which allows income and consumption type VATs to be compared. If the income type
VAT results in a smaller value of S it will typically be welfare preferred.

Export rebates at rates which differ from statutory rates used for taxes on input and
apply to the total value of product rather than just value added used directly can then
be incorporated. In this case, under a destination based VAT the cross country
arbitrage conditions become
∧

p i = e(1 + t ) p i
∧

j

pi =
h

h

(1 + t − r ) pi
e

import (not taxed)
j

export (only partially taxed in country j)

where r refers to the export rebate rate as in the Chinese structure described earlier. In
this case given the rebates applies to the value of all production, the zero profit
conditions for exporting sectors become
∧

p i = (1 + t − r )( wl i + (ri − δ i )k i ) + ∑ β ai p a

The issue then becomes the impacts of these impurities in the VAT system on trade
patterns, S and hence on welfare. As emphasized in the introduction, we put all of the
non trade effects connected to VATs structure (such as labor/leisure distortions) on one
side and only evaluate trade effects.

Model based analyses of the experience with China’s VAT reform

Data and parameterization

Our VAT model of China with monetary non neutralities incorporates 2 countries and
10 traded goods (agriculture and energy, manufactures, and other sectors). Applied
export rebate rates are from Development Research Centre, State Council. China.
Value-added tax rates are from Taxation Administration of China (See Table 3). We
construct a model compatible benchmark equilibrium data set for calibration (see

17

Dawkins, Srinivasan and Whalley 2001). Due to the multi-country character of the
data set, ensuring model consistency of data is a problem in building the benchmark
data. We first use total output, sectoral output, domestic consumption, total import and
export for China and the rest of the world from GTAP 5 database for 1997 to get the
share parameter. Then we use data from China’s 2002 input-output table yielding
China’s gross output, and totals for imports and exports. Using share data from GTAP
and China’s data from the input-output table, we generate China’s sectoral gross
output, import and export data for 2002. China’s exports are taken as imports by the
rest of the world from China. All the above data are recorded in Table 4.

The currency unit used here for Chinese domestic currency is artificial in that we set it to 8.277RMB which is the exchange rate of the US dollar to Renminbi in 2002, this implies that 1 unit RMB*
equals 1 US dollar before we scale all the data for 2005. This convention is adapted so that in calibration all equilibrium prices will be unity.

We use a Leontief technology to present total output; and Cobb-Douglas production
with constant returns to scale as value-added function in the 2 countries. On the
demand side, we use CES composites and initially set substitution elasticities to equal
to 2 in both countries. We use this as the central case although the literature provides
different estimates of this key elasticity. Many of the estimates of domestic and
import good substitution are around 2 or greater than 2 (See Betina (2003)). Table 5
and 6 report parameter values in production and preferences generated by calibration,
as well as shares of intermediate imports in China’s imports that are used in
counterfactual analysis.

Our benchmark case is a VAT with the impurities we analyze present. We then
simulate counterfactuals. One is taxes on value-added of the consumption type and
full export rebating (scenario 1); another is only VAT on value-added on a
consumption base(scenario2); and a third is with full rebating of export taxes at
statutory rate. We are also able to analyze cases where there is a substitute change in
exchange rates and export rebates.

The rates of export rebates are clearly important. Statutory rates according to Chinese
Law are listed in Table 3. Using these rates directly in our simulation procedure
potentially overestimates the effect of export rebates on export and import for a
number reasons. One is that the rates listed in table 3 are just for selected goods that
belongs to our model commodity classification rather than all goods that are classified
into these groups of commodities. Secondly, according to statistical data from China
official documents, export rebates divided by the exports yield an average actual
rebate rate across all goods of around 5%. However, given a lack of information on
export rebate by good, even though actual export rebate rates differ from the legal
rates, to implement a full rebate simulation we simply use the rebate rates according
to the law as our base case.

Simulation results

We have used our calibrated model to simulate changes in tax arrangements on both
China’s trade flows and welfare. We firstly compare an elimination of China’s export
rebate and an appreciation of the RMB by 5% with a fixed money stock in both China
and the rest of the world. Then we keep the export rebates unchanged into our model,
but shift from an income based VAT to a consumption basis. Finally, we assess the
impacts of joint elimination of export rebates and using a consumption basis VAT on
trade and welfare.

Results are presented in Tables 7 and 8. Table 7 shows that with a complete
elimination of VAT export rebates, all sectors in China increase their imports in
quantity terms which range from 0~16.9%, with the biggest changes in textiles, other
light industries and electronic equipment. All sectors decrease their exports, by an
average of 11%. However, decreasing exports causes an increase in the final use of
domestically produced goods and welfare increases by 1.45%. To compare currency
revaluation and changed tax arrangements, we also let China’s RMB revalue by 5%,
and find that the 2 instruments are substitutes.

We then compare the income basis VAT and a consumption basis VAT. Table 8 shows
if we tax imports rather than exports, imports decrease sharply by around 20%.
Exports changes very little compare to imports. Welfare in this case decreases by
2.3%.

Finally, we calibrate the opposite case to China’s currently impure VAT, which is the
case of no export rebate with consumption basis VAT. We find both exports and
imports of China decrease substantially, with export decrease around 11% and imports
decrease around 20%. Welfare thus lose 0.9%.

Conclusion

We discuss two significant impurities in China’s VAT. One is incomplete rebating of
taxes on inputs used for exports through a separate rebate system to the statutory rate.
The other is the use of an income rather than a consumption basis. We argue that in
classical public finance models these would both be treated as distortionary and the
source of a welfare cost. In a monetary trade model in which there is a fixed exchange
rate, non accommodative monetary policy, inconvertibility and endogenous reserve
accumulation things are different. Both of them departures from price can raise export
prices and reduce the surplus and yield a welfare gain. We show this using a
calibrated monetary trade general equilibrium model of China based on 2002 data.
This is suggestion of a broader theme that elements of China’s policy structure that
might strike outsiders as odd, makes more sense once the wider policy environment
within which policies operate is understood.
