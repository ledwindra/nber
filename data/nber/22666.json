    "abstract": "\n\nWe provide novel estimates of the causal impact of physician-patient relationships on physicians\u2019 decisions. Exploiting quasi-random assignment of patients to OBs at childbirth, we find OBs are 25% likelier to perform C-sections when delivering patients they have a preexisting clinical relationship with (their \u201cown patients\u201d). This effect is increasing in the relationship\u2019s strength. OBs also curtail labor sooner, are less likely to employ other invasive procedures (e.g., vacuum or forceps), and avoid complications of long and difficult births for their own patients.\n\n",
