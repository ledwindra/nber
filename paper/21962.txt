Partners in Crime: Schools, Neighborhoods and the Formation of Criminal Networks

NBER Working Paper No. 21962
February 2016
JEL No. I21,I24
ABSTRACT
Why do crime rates differ greatly across neighborhoods and schools? Comparing youth who were
assigned to opposite sides of newly drawn school boundaries, we show that concentrating disadvantaged
youth together in the same schools and neighborhoods increases total crime. We then show that these
youth are more likely to be arrested for committing crimes together – to be “partners in crime”. Our
results suggest that direct peer interaction is a key mechanism for social multipliers in criminal behavior.
As a result, policies that increase residential and school segregation will – all else equal – increase
crime through the formation of denser criminal networks.

Crime is an inherently social activity. Patterns of crime across neighborhoods and over
time display strong evidence of social interactions (Glaeser, Sacerdote and Scheinkman 1996). 1
Peer effects in criminal activity have been found within neighborhoods, schools, and juvenile
corrections facilities (Ludwig, Duncan and Hirshfield 2001, Kling, Ludwig and Katz 2005,
Ludwig and Kling 2007, Bayer, Hjalmarsson and Pozen 2009, Deming 2011, Billings, Deming
and Rockoff 2014). 2 The available evidence suggests that concentrating disadvantaged youth
together in the same environment leads to more total crime (Jacobson 2004, Cook and Ludwig
2005, Carrell and Hoekstra 2010, Deming 2011, Imberman, Kugler and Sacerdote 2012, Billings,
Deming and Rockoff 2014, Damm and Dustmann 2014).
While there is strong evidence of agglomeration externalities for criminal behavior, the
exact mechanism remains unclear. When an individual’s propensity to commit a crime varies
causally with the behavior of the group, so-called “endogenous” peer effects generate social
multipliers for interventions that target individuals. 3 Thus, the nature of endogenous peer effects
is important for policy prescriptions. Proposed mechanisms for social multipliers in crime
include strained monitoring resources (Levitt 1997, Jacobson 2004), shifting norms of behavior
and reputation (Anderson 1999, Silverman 2004), learning about criminal opportunities (Sah
1991, Calvo-Armengol and Zenou 2004) and criminal network formation (Bayer, Hjalmarsson
and Pozen 2009). Each of these mechanisms implies distinct strategies to reduce crime. For
example, if social multipliers result from youth endogenously increasing criminal activity
because they know that a fixed police presence is now spread across more potential offenders,

Bayer, Ross and Topa (2008) on labor referrals, Grinblatt, Keloharju and Ikaheimo (2008) on automobile
consumptions, and Fletcher and Ross (2012) on health behaviors.

See Ross (2011) for a recent review of the peer effects literature more generally.
3
Manski (1993) distinguishes endogenous peer effects from “exogenous” or correlated peer effects, where behavior
is affected by pre-determined characteristics or the propensity for similar individuals to self-segregate. Manski
(1993) shows that strong cross-sectional correlations between crime patterns and neighborhood characteristics need
not be evidence of social multipliers – they can be driven by exogenous peer effects or sorting.

2

the policy solution is to directly target increased monitoring resources to those areas. On the
other hand, if concentrating crime-prone youth together leads to the formation of denser and
more active criminal networks, it may be necessary to directly reduce segregation through
neighborhood mobility or school assignment policies (Billings, Deming and Rockoff 2014,
Damm and Dustmann 2014, Chetty, Hendren and Katz 2015).
In this paper, we present direct evidence of the importance of criminal network formation
for generating social multipliers in youth criminal activity. We first demonstrate strong evidence
of agglomeration externalities in crime by showing that increases in the number of similar peers
living nearby and attending the same school makes youth more likely to commit a crime.
Second, we show using newly available data that similar individuals who live near each other
and attend the same school are more likely to be arrested for having committed the same crime
together. Notably, the general empirical patterns are very similar across both findings.
Agglomeration and partnership effects are only found for individuals who reside very near each
other, within a kilometer, and are assigned to the same school. For both models, estimated
effects are largest when individuals are assigned to the same grade and of the same race and
gender.
For both analyses, we use school administrative data from Charlotte-Mecklenburg
schools (CMS) linked to arrest records from the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department
(CMPD), and we obtain exogenous variation in school and grade attendance using newly drawn
school boundaries following Billings, Deming and Rockoff (2014) and birth date required for
kindergarten attendance, respectively. In testing for agglomeration, we calculate the number of
same assigned grade-gender-race youth within a kilometer overall and who are assigned to the
same school, and make comparisons across attendance zone boundaries. Concentrations of

3

nearby youth only increase arrests if they are assigned to the same school – neighborhood
proximity alone is not sufficient. In the partnership model, we pair each youth offender residing
in the neighborhoods that were bifurcated by newly drawn attendance boundaries with all other
youth offenders, and examine how the likelihood of criminal partnership varies with distance.
We find that the likelihood of partnership declines rapidly with the distance between residences,
and as with the agglomeration model we find no relationship unless the offenders were assigned
to the same school. Consistent with the peer interaction mechanisms, we find that the partnership
impacts are strongly increasing in length of neighborhood and school residence. Taken together,
these two sets of results suggest that the formation of criminal networks – “partners in crime” - is
an important mechanism underlying social multipliers in criminal activity.
A number of recent papers shed light on the mechanisms for endogenous peer effects in
criminal activity. The most similar paper to ours is Bayer, Hjalmarsson and Pozen (2009), who
show that criminal peer effects are stronger when juveniles who have similar criminal expertise
are grouped together in correctional facilities. While the evidence in Bayer, Hjalmarsson and
Pozen (2009) is strongly suggestive of the importance of criminal networks, they cannot
demonstrate directly that youth in juvenile facilities subsequently commit crimes together.
Another closely related paper is Damm and Dustmann (2014), who find that growing up in a
high-crime neighborhood increases adult crime and that the impacts are driven by the share of
criminals rather than the number of crimes committed.
Our findings contribute to this literature by directly measuring peer interactions, and by
demonstrating that schools are an important social setting for criminal network formation. 4
While several other studies find important impacts of schools on crime, they are unable to pin
4

Also see Patacchini and Zenou (2009) for a more structural approach where they find that conforming to the
criminal activity of self-reported friends contributes to a youth’s own criminal activity. They instrument for the
criminal activity of friends using the criminal activity of the individuals who the friends report as friends.

down peers as the causal mechanism rather than school context or changes in the expected return
to schooling investments (Jacob and Lefgren 2003, Cullen, Jacob and Levitt 2006, Deming 2011,
Billings, Deming and Rockoff 2014).
Our findings suggest that neighborhood and school segregation itself may be partially
responsible for high crime rates in disadvantaged urban areas. If concentrating disadvantaged
youth together increases total crime, and if at least part of the mechanism is through the
formation of criminal networks in school, then the only way to disrupt this endogenous process is
to manipulate the location or school assignment of youth across settings. Our results help explain
why housing vouchers might reduce violent crime as in the Moving to Opportunity (MTO)
experiment, or why attending a more segregated school might increase crime (Kling, Ludwig and
Katz 2005, Billings, Deming and Rockoff 2014). In the case of Billings, Deming and Rockoff
(2014), our findings suggest that the large estimated effects of segregation might have in part
been driven by the specific policy, where students in Charlotte NC were redistricted both to more
segregated schools and to schools that contained more of their residential neighbors. However,
our findings do not imply that criminal network formation is the only mechanism for social
multipliers in crime – only that they play an important role holding other factors constant.

2. Data
Our sample is comprised of administrative records from Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools
(CMS) for all individual students that attended public school in the county. We limit the sample
to students that we observe at age 14 between the 2002-2003 and 2008-2009 school years, as
well as students for which we observe a residential address during this period. The data include
student gender, race, yearly end-of-grade (EOG) test scores, days absent and days suspended

5

from school. The EOG tests are standardized and administered across the state of North Carolina
from 1993 to the present.
This sample allows us to identify the residential location of students two years prior to
age 16, which is the age at which criminal offenders in North Carolina are included in the
registry of all adult arrests. We link CMS data to arrest registry data for Mecklenburg County
from 1998 to 2013 using first and last name as well as date of birth. 5 The arrest data includes
individual names and identifiers, and information on the number and nature of charges. 6 We
define “offenders” as students who were arrested during our sample period between the ages of
16 and 21. While this data allow us to observe the future criminal behavior of CMS students,
regardless of whether they transfer or drop out of school, they are limited to crimes committed
within Mecklenburg County.
Beginning in 2005, the registry of offenders was linked to records of all criminal
incidents, so that officers could better understand crime patterns among repeat offenders. This
data allows us to identify individuals that were arrested for the same crime. Approximately 22
percent of all reported crimes from 2005-2013 that led to an arrest of a 16 to 21 year old were
committed with one or more partners. Crimes committed by partners are disproportionately
burglaries, robberies, and drug offenses. 7
We define residential neighborhoods within Mecklenburg County using 373 Block
Groups from the 2000 Census. We identify 129 Block Groups that were bisected by middle and
high school attendance zone boundaries that were newly drawn under redistricting in the summer
of 2002. Our primary analysis involves the sample of students who attended public school at age
5

Our match rate between student and arrest records is 94% and this same matching procedure has been incorporated
and verified in Deming (2011) and Billings, Deming and Rockoff (2014) for these two datasets.

established with fingerprinting.

14 and resided in one of these bisected block groups between the 2002-2003 and 2008-2009
school years, and examining the criminal behavior of students in this sample. We also consider a
sample based on all individual students who reside in one of those block groups prior to the fall
of 2002 at any age and are age 14 or older sometime between 2002-2003 and 2008-2009.
However, the assigned school in this sample is quite noisy due to the high rates of residential
mobility among our sample of student offenders. Estimates based on this second sample are
shown in the appendix and are consistent with later results. 8
Table 1 provides descriptive statistics for our sample of students in bisected block groups
at age 14. Panel 1 presents arrest data for ages 16-21, panel 2 presents basic individual
demographics, education outcomes, and school and neighborhood attributes, and panel 3 presents
the number of peers within 1 kilometer under various restrictions. The first column shows means
for the full sample of students, the second column presents means for all offenders, and the final
column presents means for all offenders who were arrested for committing a crime with one of
more partners. The arrest rates among our sample of students are high, with 17 percent of the
sample ever being arrested and 3 percent of the sample being arrested for violent crimes. 9
Among those students ever arrested, the incidence of violent crime is 19 percent, but jumps to 34
percent for offenders who commit crimes with partners. The overall rate of individuals ever
involved in a criminal partnership for our sample of offenders is 28 percent, with offenders
involved in criminal partnerships averaging 4.26 arrests and 1.23 unique partners. Offenders are
more likely to be male, black, have low test scores, more absences and suspensions, reside in
poorer neighborhoods, and reside near more same age and same age-same school peers than all

8

For the partnership analysis, see Figure A2 and Table A1, which are comparable to Figures 2 and Table A6 using
our primary sample. Estimates for the agglomeration analysis using this sample are too noisy to be informative.

Based on the FBI Uniform Crime Reporting, we classify violent crimes as assault, kidnapping, rape and robbery,
while property crimes are auto theft, burglary, fraud/forgery, larceny and criminal trespassing (attempted burglary).

students. Other attributes are broadly similar between all offenders and those offenders involved
in criminal partnerships. Finally, panel 3 illustrates that the block groups that contain our sample
are relatively densely populated with on average two to three hundred similar aged peers within a
kilometer of our sample students.
We then use our linked student and arrest data to match student offenders in our sample
of bisected block groups with all offenders in the county, and then identify whether they were
ever criminal partners during our sample period. Specifically, for each sample offender in a
bisected block group, we create a unique observation of offender pairs based on all offenders
within three years of age who were ever arrested during our sample period. 10 We exclude pairs
less than 130 feet apart since this is the smallest distance upon which we find different school
pairs and to remove the influence of siblings and criminals within a single housing or apartment
building. 11 Then, we create an indicator variable for a criminal partnership if both individuals
were arrested for the same crime. Since our data uniquely links each individual’s arrest back to
the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department (CMPD)’s reported crime database, it allows us to
determine if two individuals were arrested for the same crime even if each member of the
partnership was arrested at different times, as well as rule out situations where individuals were
arrested at the same time, but were not acting together to commit a crime.
Given the scale for which we later observe a relationship between distance and probability
of partnership, most of our analysis focuses on pairs of offenders who live within 1 kilometer of

10

We limit analysis to individuals within 3 years of age since less than 5% of criminal partnerships involve
individuals more than 3 year apart. Even with this restriction, the size of this dataset is substantial (over 30 million
observations) and thus we limit our analysis to pairs of individuals within certain distance thresholds. For
computational ease, some models limit our sample to only non-partner observations that were ever arrested age 1618. Results are unchanged if we limit non-partner observations to only individuals ever arrested age 19-21.
11
Our main results are slightly larger in magnitude if we include these pairs.

each other. 12 For this sample of offender pairs, we observe 366 unique partners out of our
possible 123,982 pairwise combination of offenders within 1km of each other. Our key analysis
focuses on the relative share of partners for offender pairs assigned to the same school versus
different schools. Unconditionally, 85% of offender pairs are assigned to the same school, but
94% of criminal partners were assigned to the same school. This relatively higher concentration
of criminal partnerships for offender pairs assigned to the same school is the main insight from
the partnership analysis. Appendix Table A2 present descriptive statistics for the sample of
matched pairs based on assigned school. 13

3. Empirical Strategy
3.1 Peer Exposure and Crime Agglomeration
First, we test whether increased opportunities for local interactions with same school
peers affect the likelihood of committing a crime. Specifically, the likelihood of individual i in
school s and neighborhood n committing a crime (𝐶𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) is allowed to depend upon the number of

students N who share student i’s attributes (𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) and reside within a specified distance; the

number of students S who share these same attributes including residential proximity and are also
assigned to the same school; neighborhood fixed effects 𝛿𝑛 ; assigned school fixed effects; and
individual controls 𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖 .

𝐶𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼1 𝑁�𝑋𝑗𝑗,𝑣−𝑤 = 𝑋𝑖𝑖,𝑣−𝑤 |𝑑𝑖𝑖 < 𝑑̅ � + 𝛼2 𝑆�𝑋𝑗𝑗,𝑣−𝑤 = 𝑋𝑖𝑖,𝑣−𝑤 |𝑑𝑖𝑖 < 𝑑̅ , 𝑠 = 𝑡� +
𝛿𝑛 + 𝛾𝑆 + 𝛽𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜇𝑖𝑖𝑖

(1)

12

One kilometer is identified as the threshold for which the relationship between distance and probability of
partnership approaches zero in our dataset.
13
We do observe some differences in the distribution of students attributes between partners and non-partners.
Partners are more likely to be similar in age, both male, same race and both reside in single-family residences than
non-partners.

9

where 𝑁 and 𝑆 are constructed so that they contain the number of students j who match student i
on attributes v through w in the vector 𝑋𝑗 and satisfy the distance threshold for 𝑁 and both

distance threshold and same school criteria for 𝑆. We start with a simple model just requiring

same assigned grade and then we condition on same grade, race and gender, student type. In

models that condition on student type, we expand our vector of fixed effects to neighborhood by
student type fixed effects. Finally, we restrict N and S only to student’s whose predicted
likelihood of committing a crime falls in the top quintile, as well as allow effects to vary by
racial and ethnic group.
The inclusion of neighborhood or neighborhood by student type fixed effects yields
models that are identified from differences in proximate same school potential peers for similar
individuals in the same general neighborhood simply due to school attendance boundary
configuration. While variation in potential same school peers exists within attendance zones
based on exact residential location, the control for overall number of proximate peers captures
any variation in neighborhood peer concentration for similar students in similar residential
locations. The fact that we focus on school assignment – rather than actual attendance – also
further limits the effects of individuals changing schools due to disciplinary problems or early
criminal behavior.

3.2 Criminal Partnership
We then ask the following question: is an individual more likely to commit a crime with
an individual who resides nearby if they are also assigned to the same school? Concretely,
suppose that the probability of criminal partnership depends upon both spatial proximity and
school attended:

10

𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝑓�𝑑𝑖𝑖 � + 𝑔�𝑑𝑖𝑖 �𝐷(𝑠 = 𝑡) + 𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

(2)

where f and g are functions that describe the relationship between the probability of partnership
and distance (𝑑𝑖𝑖 ) between the two individuals, D is an indicator for whether the two individuals

are assigned to the same school or the same school and grade, and 𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is an idiosyncratic error.
The function f captures the reduced form relationship over distance for pairs of offenders who

are assigned to different schools, and our function of interest g captures the effect of school
assignment on this relationship. Intuitively, our identification strategy asks whether the
probability of criminal partnership between any two offenders who live the same distance apart
is greater when they also attend the same school.
Then, we extend the model by adding a neighborhood fixed effect 𝛿𝑛 based on i’s

neighborhood and controls 𝑋𝑗𝑗 for the individual j who is being paired with each individual i in
neighborhood n, where 𝑋𝑗𝑗 also includes a school t fixed effect. Specifically,

𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝑓�𝑑𝑖𝑖 � + 𝑔�𝑑𝑖𝑖 �𝐷(𝑠 = 𝑡) + 𝛿𝑛 + 𝛽𝑋𝑗𝑗 + 𝛾𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 if 𝑑𝑖𝑖 < 𝑑̅

(3)

The neighborhood fixed effect implies that g is identified by differences in the frequency of
criminal partnership for two offenders who reside in the same neighborhood, but are on opposite
sides of the school attendance boundary and so could not both be assigned to the same school as
individual j.
Our initial analyses estimate f and f+g by creating a histogram of the distribution of
criminal partnership frequency over distance separately for pairs of offenders in the same school
and pairs of offenders in different schools. In our follow-up analyses, we restrict our sample to
j’s who reside within a specified distance threshold 𝑑̅ of an individual i and so f and f+g are

specified implicitly as step functions, where we specify 𝑑̅ based on the distribution of criminal
11

partnership over pairwise distances 𝑑𝑖𝑖 . Standard errors for this model and for generalizations of
this model are clustered at the neighborhood n level of individual i in each pair. 14

In addition, we examine criminal partnership by type of crime, and whether criminal
partnership is greater when students are assigned to the same grade or share similar
characteristics, i.e. race and gender. Finally, we examine the association of partnership with
actually attending the same school, and explore whether the association is greater when partners
are in the same grade, as well as whether they shared a classroom together. However, unlike our
results for school assignment and school and birth date implied grade assignment (which are
arguably exogenous),

15

school attended, current grade and assignment to classrooms is

potentially biased by sorting and so we treat these results as suggestive.

3.3 Initial Robustness Checks
The use of the newly drawn boundaries under court-ordered end of racial-based busing in
2002 helps address concerns about boundaries correlating with neighborhood attributes and the
presence of both school and neighborhood fixed effects help address concerns about post-busing
sorting based on neighborhood and school quality. Based on the model given by Equation 1, we
formally show that student attributes do not explain school peer concentration in Table 2. 16
Table 2 highlights four measures of potential same school peers: number of students
assigned to the same school, number of students assigned to the same school and grade (based on
age) residing within one kilometer, number of students assigned to the same school and grade

14

As robustness tests, we later estimate models that include distance bin fixed effects , individual fixed effects for
each individual j as well as models that control for individual j by neighborhood n fixed effects.
15
Same grade in the school assigned models is based on starting kindergarten when an individual is age 5 by
September 1st and normal grade progression.
16
The fact that Billings, Deming and Rockoff (2014) find minimal residential relocation after redistricting based on
changes in school peer composition minimizes some of these concerns too.

12

who share the individuals’ gender and race, and number of high risk students assigned to the
same school and grade who share the individuals’ gender and race, where high risk is based on a
simple regression of ever arrested on student attributes of rising 9th graders prior to the 2002
redistricting. We then regress these measures of peers on student attributes, neighborhood peer
counts and block group of residence by student type fixed effects. Only our first measure of
peers – which looks across school grades - shows any relationship between student attributes and
the number of same school peers with a joint significance of 10 percent. Our preferred withingrade models in columns 2, 3 and 4 all show that student attributes do not explain same school
peers and those coefficients are small in magnitude with demographic dummies generating
marginal effects of at most 0.01 standard deviations in same school peers.
In order to test the validity of our school attendance boundary discontinuity approach for
our partnership analysis, we provide a second balancing test for assigned to same school for our
sample of bisected block group offenders who are paired to all other similar age offenders. Table
3 presents the results of a regression of whether paired offenders are assigned to the same school
(column 1) or assigned to the same school and grade (column 2) on variables for demographic
attributes, test scores, suspensions and absences for individual j, while controlling for census
block group fixed effects associated with the bisected block group. Both assignment measures
pass the balancing tests and coefficients are small given that 85% of our sample is in the same
school and 16% of our sample is in the same school and grade.
Since early adolescent behavioral or academic problems may be predictive of adult
criminal activity and thus may influence residential location, we also examine models that focus
on individuals with longer neighborhood tenures. If our results were driven by movers into these

13

neighborhoods, we would expect larger effects for the recent residents, and we find no evidence
of larger effects for this group in any of our later models. 17

4. Results
4.1 Effects of Exposure to Potential Peers
Table 4 presents models that estimate the impact of peer agglomeration on the likelihood
of individual youths committing a crime. Using our sample of students from blocks that are
bisected by a newly drawn school boundary, we regress indicators for ever having been arrested
for any crime and for violent and property crimes respectively on both the number of potential
peers overall and the number of potential peers in the same school. We define a student’s
potential peers in four ways: 1) nearby (within 1 kilometer); 2) nearby, same assigned grade; 3)
nearby, same assigned grade, same race and same gender; and 4) nearby, same assigned grade,
same race, same gender, and at high risk of arrest (predicted values of ever arrested place student
in the top quintile). The results for these four measures are shown in panels 1 through 4.
Column 1 of Table 4 presents results for ever arrested, and the next two columns present
the results for ever arrested for a violent crime and ever arrested for a property crime. Panel 1
presents the results for number of same school peers, and the estimates are small and not
significantly different from zero. Panel 2 presents results for same school-grade peers, and the
estimates are larger overall and statistically significant for property crimes. When potential
partners are defined based on same grade, race and gender (Panel 3), we find large positive
effects of same school potential partners on the likelihood of a student committing any crime, a
violent crime or a property crime.
17

See Tables A3 and A7.

14

The coefficients on same school, grade, race and gender peers indicate that a standard
deviation increase (8.3 students) in same school peers increases the probability of ever being
arrested by 3.9 percentage points, which indicates a 23% increase in the probability of arrest
relative to the average student. A standard deviation increase in the number of school peers that
are the same age, race and gender increases the probability of violent or property crime arrest by
2.2 and 2.9 percentage points respectively. This effect represents a relatively larger increase of
67% and 41% in the probability of arrest relative to the average student. When focusing only on
high risk potential peers, we see a substantial increase in the absolute effect on violent crimes
consistent with the effects for violent crimes being disproportionately driven by these high risk
students.
The last panel of table 4 presents estimates separately for four gender and race groups –
minority males, minority females, white males and white females- using all four groups
separately to define peers. All estimates are positive and quite sizable on ever arrested for males,
but the estimates are largest and statistically significant for minority males. Minority males are
over 6 percentage points more likely to be arrested for any crime if they have a one standard
deviation increase in same school, minority male peers in their neighborhood, and about 3
percentage points more likely to be arrested for violent crimes. For violent and property crimes,
we also find sizable effects for minority females.
In order to examine the spatial scale of the agglomeration results, we ran a series of
regressions that redefined our peers as individuals within varying distance bands of 0-1km, 12km, 2-3km, 3-4km and 4-5km. Figure 1 presents results for models using the outcome of ever
arrested and indicates that we only observe any effects from peers for our less than 1km
definition of neighborhood. Results for larger distance bands are all closer to zero and are

15

typically more precisely estimated due to the larger number of different school peers. Results for
other arrest outcomes are similar to this figure. In Appendix Table A4, we conduct a
counterfactual analysis based on randomly shifting school attendance boundaries by between 1
and 2km in every direction. The random boundaries will bisect neighborhoods in the middle of
attendance zones so that students on either side of the boundary are actually assigned to the same
school. We would expect there to be no relationship between an individual’s arrest outcomes
and nearby peer same school concentration based on these artificial boundaries conditional on
overall peers because students on either side of the false boundary actually have approximately
the same number of actual same school peers. Since we want to conduct this falsification for a
number of boundary shifts, we randomly shift attendance boundaries and recalculate school
assignment 100 times. We then re-estimate our main results in Table 4 but report the mean and
standard deviation of our coefficient across these 100 replications. The estimates on “falsely
assigned same school” potential peers are statistically insignificant, and always substantially
smaller in magnitude than the significant estimates in Table 4.
Overall, the results in Table 4 and Figure 1 show that youth who happen to have larger
concentrations of peers living in close physical proximity and attending the same school are
more likely to be arrested. The results are strongest for same peers of the same grade, race and
gender, and are concentrated among minority males. In the next section, we use criminal
partnership data to show that this increase in crime is driven in part by youth committing crimes
together.

4.2 Criminal Partnerships

16

Our agglomeration analysis establishes key facts about residential location spillovers
arising from the concentration of youth. Location spillovers are very proximate, happening
within 1 kilometer, and concentrated among youth who are assigned to the same school. Further,
the spillovers arise entirely for youth that are similar in age (same assigned grade), are
concentrated among youth that match on gender and race, and finally are largest among minority
males. Having established these key empirical patterns in our causal estimates, we now turn to
our partnership analysis in order to establish whether similar patterns arise in the likelihood of
being arrest together for committing a crime
We begin our criminal partnership analysis with graphical results that display the
relationship between distance and the probability of criminal partnerships. Figure 2 plots the
probability of a pair of offenders committing a crime together as a function of the distance
between the offenders. 18 We show results separately for two samples – students assigned to same
school and grade, and students assigned to different schools and the same grade. 19 In both
models we condition on block group fixed effects associated with the residence of offender i, and
covariates for the observed attributes of offender j. The figure shows that the probability of
partnership is high when the offenders are within a few hundred feet of each other and are
assigned to the same school, and declines quickly towards zero and is very near to zero once the
offenders are 1km away or more. The probability of partnership for offenders who attend
different schools is small and does not demonstrate any significant relationship with distance. 20
This constitutes strong prima facie evidence that attending the same school increases the
18

The distribution of offenders and partners (all as well as subsamples for same/different school) is presented in
Appendix Figures A.5, A.6 and A.7. These figures highlight that the sample size for different school pairs increases
substantially at larger distances, and for distances within 1km about 15% of our observations are assigned different
schools.
19
Appendix Figure A.4 shows similar results for the same school/different school comparison.
20
The relatively higher probability of partnerships for different school/same grade at 1km is due to a few
partnerships at similar distances and is not statistically different from same school/grade partnerships.

likelihood of criminal partnership, even for students who live in the same neighborhoods. There
are negligible differences between Figure 2 and a similar figure that does not control for
observed covariates.
Figure 3 presents the difference between our conditional probabilities of partnerships for
the two samples. The 95% confidence intervals are represented by the shaded area. The
differences are statistically significant for pairs who are located within about 2/3 km of each
other and differences are almost significant at distances closer to 1 km. 21 Overall, these results
highlight a strong positive relationship between shared school assignment and criminal
partnerships for individuals that live very close together. As we found in our agglomeration
analysis, the effect of spatial proximity on partnerships is entirely associated with proximity to
potential peers who are assigned to the same school.
In order to verify that these results are due to school assignment boundaries and not the
spatial distribution of offenders, we conduct a second falsification test in Appendix Figure A3
where we randomly shifted all attendance boundaries by between 1 and 2 kms. We construct a
new version of Figure 3 where we assign our main sample of offender pairs to same or different
schools based on these false boundaries. We repeated this exercise 500 times in order to create a
distribution of false boundary discontinuities and present the average results as a solid line and a
95% confidence interval as the shaded area in Figure A3. This figure does not demonstrate any
relationship between falsely assigned same school and partnership based on spatially relevant,
artificial attendance zone boundaries.
Table 5 presents estimates of equation (3) based on pairs who are within ½, 1 or 2
kilometers of each other, with the same dependent variable as the figures above: being arrested
together for at least one crime. The right hand side variables in the model are assigned to same

The standard errors are bootstrapped based on resampling from the data 500 times.

school and assigned to same school and same grade based on birth date. All models include
block group fixed effects for offenders i in the bisected block groups and controls for the
observable attributes of the paired offenders j. Column 1 presents estimates of the partnership
model for these subsamples. The coefficients on offenders being assigned to the same school
and assigned to the same school and grade are both positive and highly statistically significant
for all distance thresholds.
Consistent with our figures, the strongest effects occur for individuals residing within ½
km and effects weaken as we extend distance thresholds out to 2 km. Given the limited number
of observations in different schools within ½ km, we focus our analysis on results for 1km.
Results at 1 km are more precise than the ½ km results and have quantitatively similar
magnitudes relative to mean partnership rates. For column 1, being assigned to the same school
increases the probability of being criminal partners by 0.21 percentage points and being assigned
to the same grade increases this probability by an additional 0.33 percentage points. Overall,
being assigned to the same school and grade makes two individuals six times more likely to form
a criminal partnership, increasing from a mean probability of 0.0011 for different school pairs to
0.0065 for same school and grade pairs.
The rest of the columns in Table 5 present the model using the number of crimes
committed together, if individuals were partners at age 16-18, partners at age 19-21, and finally
partnerships for specific crime classifications. 22 Column 2 examines if schools have an effect on
the number of partnerships between two offenders. Results for both same school and same
school/grade are positive and the magnitudes are larger than other estimates relative to the mean
number of partnerships. Partnership effects for both same school and same grade persist except

22

Appendix Table A5 shows results for assigned school by further disaggregated types of crime with assault and
burglary generating the largest effects.

19

for the 19-21 age samples where effects are primarily at the same school level. The fact that age
16-18 and age 19-21 results differ for same school and grade coefficients is consistent with
partnerships within grade being more likely during years that individuals are still in school or
recently dropped out of school. Results for crime categories show a consistent role of schools in
increasing criminal partnerships for a variety of criminal activities.

4.3 Robustness Checks and Additional Results
Since offenders may form partnerships based on students attributes, Table 6 presents
results from models where we examine heterogeneity in the likelihood of two offenders
partnering together based on same assigned school. We re-estimate our main model from Table
5 including additional controls for the socio-economic/demographic match between the two
offenders in any pair, and interact these controls with the assigned to the same school dummy
variable. These variables include whether the offenders are assigned to the same grade (as in
Table 5) and four dummies for whether they match on minority status and gender: both maleminority etc. 23
We find strong effects of increased partnership when the offenders in the pair are in the
same grade, are both minority males and more modest effects for both minority female. These
results are robust for both the 16-18 and the 19-21 age group subsamples and for minority males
robust for violent and property crimes. These patterns are very similar to the patterns uncovered
in the agglomeration analysis.

23

These variables are essentially triple interactions. Our models also include variables for all of the associated two
way interactions.

20

Appendix Table A6 provides a series of robustness checks for our partnership models. 24
Results are largely consistent across these models with both distance bin and individual fixed
effects generating similar results. The only noticeable difference across these specifications is the
smaller magnitude when we base school assignment solely on high school attendance zone
boundaries. Smaller effects for models where school assignment only based on high school is
consistent with the loss of same school partners that interacted in middle school only.
In addition, as discussed above, we ran a series of models that interact our school
variables with a dummy for individual i living in the same address since 2001. If our results are
driven by individuals sorting into these neighborhoods, we might expect stronger results for the
most recent residents who presumably selected into a particular side of the boundary based on
across boundary differences. On the other hand, if our results arise from social interactions, we
might expect the strongest results to arise between individuals who have resided in this
neighborhood the longest and so have the strongest connections to the neighborhood. Table A7
shows estimated effects for the partnership model. The estimates suggest stronger effects on pre2002 residents for both school variables, which is consistent with our main results not being
driven by new residents sorting to schools after redistricting, and thus limits concern that post
redistricting sorting is generating our results. 25

24

Appendix Table A6 presents a series of robustness tests where the first column presents the main results for the
within 1 kilometer sample. The second column presents the model for the same sample, but including fixed effects
based on bins for different distances between the individuals in the pair. The third and fourth columns present the
model for the ½ kilometer sample, without and with the distance bin fixed effects, respectively. Column 5 presents
results for the 1 kilometer sample replacing offender j’s observable attributes with an individual offender fixed
effect. Columns 6 and 7 presents the results for the 1 kilometer sample without and with individual fixed effects
where same school assignment is based only on high school. The final column presents estimates controlling for
residential block group of offender i by individual offender j fixed effects.
25
In addition, we tested our main results for our sample of students using a student’s residential address prior to
2002 and provide results in the top panel of Appendix Table A1 and Appendix Figure A2. Our conclusions
regarding the role of schools is still consistent in these models, but represents a mix of attenuated results due to the
large amount of residential movement coupled with a greater presence of pre-2002 address information for longerterm neighborhood residents. For example, only 35% of our main sample of offenders live in the same address at

21

Appendix Table A8 provides a version of our main partnership results (Table 5) for the 1
kilometer sample using whether partners actually attended the same school, the same school and
same grade, and attended at least two classes together. 26 These models all include fixed effects
for individual j since individuals likely attended schools and specific courses based on a number
of unobserved attributes. 27 Most of the effects are concentrated among pairs who attended class
together, but partnership effects also arise at both the grade and school level. The magnitudes of
our effects are larger in these models even though in some cases we lose statistical significance.
For column 1, being in the same course, grade and school increase the probability of partnership
by 0.0097 percentage points over the mean partnership probability of 0.0016 for different school
partners. Again, we find that the effects on 19-21 year old partners are substantially smaller than
for 16-18 year old partners. 28 Similar to results for individuals with longer tenures in a home,
Appendix Table A14 examines whether partnerships are more likely for pairs that attended the
same elementary school and we find stronger effects for this subgroup.

5. Conclusion
In this paper we study the influence of schools and neighborhoods on criminal
partnership. We find evidence for neighborhood spillovers in crime based on exposure to same
race and gender peers. These effects only arise when the students reside in close proximity to
each other and are assigned to the same school, and the effects are strongest when the students

age 14 as they did in 2001. Coupled with the fact that we are using pairs of offenders leads to only about 10% of our
observations having the same residential information in 2001 as well as at age 14.
26
Defining same course as at least two classes together provides more precise estimates than other definitions.
Summary statistics for our partnership bisected by school attended is provided in Appendix Table A9
27
To further test if sorting to specific courses is problematic to our results, we created Appendix Table A10 where
we only define same course based on courses required of all students in english, math, science and social studies.
28
Appendix Tables A11, A12 and A13 provide results for different crime types, other model specifications and
interactions with student attributes for models based on school attended and generate similar conclusions as our
school assigned results.

22

are also assigned to the same grade. These effects are driven primarily by males, especially
minority males, and are stronger when the potential peer is especially likely to ever have been
arrested based on observables. Given strong existing evidence of homophily in friendship
patterns by race and grade/age (Weinberg 2007; Fletcher, Ross and Zhang 2013), the patterns of
findings are clearly consistent with social interactions contributing to the probability of
committing a crime.
Further, our analysis of criminal partnership is consistent with the role of social
interactions. We find very similar patterns on the likelihood of individual offenders being
arrested for the same crime, i.e. partnering together to commit a crime. The effects of proximity
on partnership are strong and decay rapidly over space. These effects are only observed when
the offenders were assigned to the same school, and again are stronger when the offenders were
also assigned to the same grade. The effects are strongest when the offenders share the same
race and gender too, and the largest effects are for minority males.
Our results have important implications for understanding the determinants of criminal
activity. School assignment policies can have unintended effects on neighborhood crime in that
drawing boundaries that keep together cohesive neighborhoods with clusters of similar students
may contribute to higher rates of criminal activity among youth, greater frequency of criminal
partnerships among young offenders, and larger criminal networks facilitating future
partnerships and crimes. Our results also have implications for the literature on the endogenous
effects of social interactions. We demonstrate that the social context of the school affects a key
behavior related to criminal activity, criminal partnerships, and show that the relationship
between the availability of local peers and criminal activity follows a pattern that is consistent
with what we would expect if peers were influencing criminal activity by presenting partnership

23

opportunities. This suggests that interventions which reduce crime among a subset of youth
within a school will have a spillover effect on other potential criminals by reducing the
opportunities for criminal partnership available to other students who live nearby, leading to a
social multiplier that would not exist if the mechanism behind the peer effects were purely social
learning or school context.

This figure provides the distribution of partnership probabilities conditional on individual and neighborhood
attributes for our sample of offender pairs. The solid line represents pairs assigned to the same middle or high
school and the same grade while the dotted line represents pairs assigned to different schools and the same
grade. The x-axis indicates the pairwise distance between each individual’s home address (while in school) and
conditional probabilities are based on the residuals from a first stage regression which controls for individual
attributes of person j (gender, race, test scores, absences, suspensions, assigned school fixed effects ) , school
year born fixed effects for k and CBG fixed effects for i. We also implement kernel-weighted local polynomial
smoothing in order to generate a continuous distribution of conditional probabilities.
The sample used to construct this figure includes all pairs of arrested individuals (age 16-21) who are three years
or less apart in age (less than 5% of criminal partners are more than 3 year apart), live within 3 km of each other
based on school age 14 address and at least one offender resides in a Census Block Group (CBG) bisected by a
new middle or high school attendance zone boundary. For computational ease, we limit non-partner pairs to
only those ever arrested age 16-18, but results are similar with the use of non-partner pairs arrested age 19-21.

* p < 0.1, ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01. Standard errors robust to arbitrary correlation within CBG. All dependent variables in column headings
have been standardized to a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. The dependent variable in column one indicates the number of peers that live within 1 km and are assigned to the same middle or high school. Column two restricts the definition of peers in
column one to be the same grade, column 3 further restricts to same gender and same race also. Column 4 defines peers based on same
grade-race-gender peers that are also identified as high risk for arrest. To determine arrest risk, we conduct a first stage regression of
ever being arrested on student attributes for a sample of students that were rising 9th graders prior to 2002 and not involved in criminal partnerships. We define high risk based on those individuals that fall in the top quintile of predicted arrest using the first stage
estimated coefficients.
The sample used for determining the number of peers is based on all students attending CMS at school age 14 at any time from 2003-2009.
Each column includes but does not report coefficients for same neighborhood (6 1km) peer counts based on each column’s definition
of peers. For columns 2-4, we also include but do not report variables for total number of peers in neighborhood as well as assigned to
the same school and neighborhood.
All reported covariates for test scores, suspension days and days absent are based on 5th grade and all models include but do not report
an indicator if missing a test score or other 5th grade information and assigned school fixed effects. Column one includes Census Block
Group 2000 (CBG), column two includes CBG by grade fixed effects, column 3 includes includes CBG by grade, gender and race fixed
effects. Column five includes CBG by grade, gender, race and quintile of predicted arrest fixed effects.

* p < 0.1, ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01. Standard errors robust to arbitrary correlation within CBG. We include a total of 129 unique CBGs in
our sample.
All regressions include but do not report an indicator for missing a test score/absences, dummies for year individual j turned age 5 as of
9/1, assigned middle and high school fixed effects for j and CBG fixed effects for person i.
We define assigned to the same school as two individuals being assigned to the same middle or high school based on 2002-2003 school
attendance boundaries. Same grade is based on starting kindergarten at age 5 and normal grade progression. Column 2 excludes same
school, different grade pairs and includes an indicator if individual i and j are the same grade. F-statistics reports p-value that all reported covariates are jointly equal to zero.

* p < 0.1, ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01. Standard errors robust to arbitrary correlation within CBG. All coefficients indicate the marginal effect
of a standard deviation increase in the number of peers on arrest outcomes. The top panel of results is based on defining an individual’s
number of peers as all students within 1 km, second panel expands to those students that are the same grade, third panel defines peers
based on same grade, same gender and same race. The fourth panel includes peer counts based on same grade-race-gender peers that
are also identified as high risk for arrest. To determine arrest risk, we conduct a first stage regression of ever being arrested on student
attributes for a sample of students that were rising 9th graders prior to 2002 and not involved in criminal partnerships. We define high
risk based on those individuals that fall in top quintile of predicted arrest using the first stage estimated coefficients.
The sample used for determining the number of peers is based on all students attending CMS at school age 14 at any time from 2003-2009.
Each cell indicates a separate regression and we include but do not report coefficients for total students in same school-neighborhood,
total students in the same neighborhood and same neighborhood counts for each peer definition.
All regressions include controls for gender, race, 5th grade reading and math test scores, indicator if missing a test score or other 5th grade
information, days suspended (5th grade) , total days absent (5th grade), single family home indicator, assigned school fixed effects.
The top panel includes Census Block Group 2000 (CBG), second panel includes CBG by grade, third panel includes CBG by grade, gender
and race fixed effects. The fourth panel includes CBG by grade, gender, race and quintile of predicted arrest fixed effects.
Ever Arrested Property indicates that an individual was arrested for auto theft, burglary, fraud/forgery or larceny between ages 16-21.
Ever Arrested Violent indicates that an individual was arrested for aggravated/sexual/simple assault, rape or robbery between ages 1621.
The bottom set of results provide interaction effects for minority and gender for our model using peers defined as same age-race-gender.

All regressions include controls for gender, race, 5th grade reading and math test scores, indicator if missing a test score or other 5th
grade information, days suspended (5th grade) , total days absent (5th grade), single family home indicator, indicator for year individual
j turned age 5 as of 9/1, assigned middle and high school fixed effects, and CBG fixed effects for person i. We also include an indicator
if individuals i and j are the same assigned grade.
Dependent Variable is an indicator based on column heading. Number of partner crimes indicates the number of times a pair of individuals were arrested for the same crime. 16-18 and 19-21 yr old indicates the age group for which one of the partners belonged at
the time of arrest. Property Crime Partnerships include partnerships where at least one individual was arrested for auto theft, burglary, fraud/forgery or larceny. Violent Crime Partnerships include partnerships where at least one individual was arrested for aggravated/sexual/simple assault, rape or robbery. Felony and Misdemeanor based on the severity of the charge at arrest and coded accordingly by the Mecklenburg County Sheriff’s Department.
