ABSTRACT
We present new data documenting European capital issues in major financial centers from 1919 to 1932.
Push factors (conditions in international capital markets) perform better than pull factors (conditions
in the borrowing countries) in explaining the surge and reversal in capital flows. In particular, the sharp
increase in stock market volatility in the major financial centers at the end of the 1920s figured importantly
in the decline in foreign lending. We draw parallels with Europe today.

Introduction

From 2001 through 2008 one half of Europe received enormous capital inflows from the
other half of Europe and the rest of the world. Starting in 2009, the recipients then experienced a
sudden stop, a capital-account reversal, and an economic and financial crisis.

From 1924

through 1928 one half of Europe received enormous capital inflows from the other half of
Europe and the rest of the world. Starting in 1929, the recipients then experienced a sudden stop,
a capital-account reversal, and an economic and financial crisis.
The fact that there are parallels between the economic and financial crises in Europe in
the interwar years and today is invoked frequently, if mainly at an anecdotal level. And while
there exist a number of empirical studies of the determinants of capital flows in Europe
following the creation of the euro (see e.g. Ahearne, Schmitz and von Hagen 2008, Lane and
Pels 2012), there are few comparable analyses of capital movements in the 1920s and 1930s. In
this paper we fill this gap with a new analysis of the determinants of capital flows and capitalaccount reversals between the wars. While we mainly seek to shed light on interwar experience,
we hope in addition that our analysis will provide new perspective on the financial crisis in
Europe today.
Interwar capital flows have of course been studied before. Contemporary accounts like
Harris (1935) focused on the German case and argued that foreign lending in the 1920s was
perverse, unproductive and unsustainable.1 Nurkse (1944) generalized the point, arguing that
capital movements were erratic in the 1920s and destabilizing in the 1930s, although he was not
always explicit about what he meant by erratic and destabilizing.2 The parallels with ex-post

And, more recently, Ritschl (2012). We consider his analysis below.

and James (1992, 2002).

indictments of capital flows to peripheral Europe in the years leading up to the 2008-9 financial
crisis are evident.
Despite this, a systematic analysis of European capital flows in the 1920s and early 1930s
does not appear to exist. Such analysis might address questions like the following. How large
were the capital surge and reversal compared with the recent eurozone episode? What was the
relative importance of private versus official flows? What were the main drivers of observed
capital movements? To what extent did changes in borrowing countries’ conditions and in global
capital markets’ conditions affect the direction and volume of flows?
In this paper we seek to address these questions. Our data on gross long-term private
capital issues on account of European countries are drawn from an unpublished compendium of
capital movements in Europe in the Mudd Library at Princeton University and evidently
authored by Ragnar Nurkse (1943).3 In addition, we provide some analysis of net capital flows.
Our framework is in the spirit of recent analyses of the retrenchment of capital flows at the time
of the 2008-9 financial crisis such as Milesi-Ferretti and Tille (2011).
We show that capital flows to the European recipients were large: in 1927, the aggregate
current account deficit of Austria, Germany and Hungary was nearly 5% of their aggregate GDP.
At the same time, however, this was smaller than the collective current account deficit of Greece,
Ireland, Italy, Spain and Portugal in 2008 (6.7% of their collective GDP).4 On the other hand,
the subsequent reversal was even larger in the early 1930s: the shift in Central European
countries’ current account deficit between 1927 and 1931 represented 6.0% of their collective
3

Some similar analysis appears in Nurkse’s 1944 classic, International Currency Experience, published by the
League of Nations. The Financial Section and Economic Intelligence Service of the League, for which Nurkse
worked, was transferred to Princeton following the outbreak of World War II. Private capital flows include League
of Nations-sponsored loans as well as loans extended in conjunction with the Dawes and Young Plans, since these
were underwritten by private investment banks and placed with private investors.

GDP, whereas between 2008 and 2011, by comparison, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and
Spain experienced a current account contraction amounting to “only” 3.2 per cent of their
aggregate GDP. The much larger provision of official financing in the more recent episode
largely accounts for this difference. In other words, net private capital outflows from European
debtors were in fact larger in 2011 than in 1931 but they were also compensated by much larger
inflows of official capital.
We find further that push factors (conditions in international capital markets) do better
than pull factors (conditions in the borrowing countries) in explaining the surge and reversal. In
particular, the sharp increase in stock market volatility in the major financial centers at the end of
the 1920s figured importantly in the decline in foreign lending. In parallel with the recent
episode of flows from Northern to Southern Europe, analyses attributing the surge of lending and
then its reversal to policy distortions in the borrowing countries capture only part of the story.
This pattern is strikingly like that detected by Milesi-Ferretti and Tille in the run-up to the recent
crisis.
In Section 2 we describe the data. Section 3 then uses them to characterize the lending
surge and reversal periods. Sections 4 and 5 focus on pull and push factors in turn, while Section
6 provides a detailed analysis of the capital-flow-reversal episode. Section 7, concluding, returns
to implications for today.

Data

Our analysis of the determinants of capital flows employs new estimates of private bond
issues in six major financial centers: New York, London, Paris, Amsterdam, Stockholm and

4

Zurich.5 These estimates, spanning the period 1919 to 1932, were compiled from an anonymous,
typewritten, pencil-annotated memo in the Ragnar Nurkse papers at Princeton University’s Mudd
Library.6 This document, dated June 1943 and entitled “Europe’s Capital Movements, 19191932: A Statistical Note,” was prepared for the League of Nations. Nurkse was almost certainly
its author or at least contributed substantially to its making.7 The memo contains detailed yearly
information on the total volume of bond issues on account of European countries. Data are
broken down by recipient country and type of borrower (central and provincial
governments/municipalities/corporations). The memo covers 28 European countries and
comprises, it would appear, the population of European bond issues in the six centers. Detailed
commentary indicates that much careful work was done to place new issues in different financial
centers on a comparable basis and thus address the inconsistency problems of other sources.8
Whereas other contemporary and historical studies of international capital movements
rely on estimates of net capital flows computed from balance-of-payment statistics, we work here
mainly with gross primary issues.

Gross as opposed to net capital flows have several

advantages. First, reliable balance-of-payments statistics for the pre-World War II period only
exist for a few countries. Second, the capital account is constructed as the residual item of the
balance of payments and is therefore subject to reliability problems.9 Third, focusing on net
capital flows can cause one to miss important parts of the story. Fostel and Kaminsky (2007)
note that net capital flows say little about countries’ ability to “tap international capital markets,”

5

Thus, we exclude official capital flows and short-term credits extended by central banks and governments.

copy “has a note that it was received from the Princeton Institute of Advanced Studies”.

as a zero net flow might very well reflect a large (gross) inflow counterbalanced by a large
(gross) outflow. They therefore recommend using international primary issuance as an indicator
of access to foreign finance. Broner et al. (2013), Milesi-Ferretti and Tille (2011), Fratzscher
(2012), and Forbes and Warnock (2012) also stress the importance of considering gross capital
flows in sudden-stop episodes as a way of distinguishing the behavior of foreign and domestic
investors. While there is a handful of studies of gross long-term capital issues in the nineteenth
century (Clemens and Williamson, 2004, Catao, 2007, Esteves, 2007), we are not aware of
similar work for the interwar years. Moreover, work on the classical gold standard has focused
on capital issues in one or two financial centers.10 Our data, in contrast, track European bond
issues in all major financial centers in the 1919-1932 period.11
Naturally our data also have limitations. Most importantly, they exclude short-term
capital movements.12 Short-term loans constituted a non-negligible part of capital flows and
were used extensively in financing trade.13 Then there was the steady amortization (retirement)
by previous borrowers of their outstanding obligations. There was also some repatriation of
foreign securities to investors in the issuing countries; Lary (1943) and Bloomfield (1950)
observe that with the normalization of economic conditions in Europe in the second half of the
1920s, securities issued abroad by governments and corporations became more attractive to

10

Clemens and Williamson (2004) focus on primary issues on the London market in the 1865-1913 period, using the
data collected by Jenks (1927) and Simon (1968), and later updated by Stone (1999). Esteves compares the
determinants of capital issues in Britain and Germany, using original data for the German Stock Exchange
assembled from a range of primary sources. Catao (2007) and Bordo, Cavallo and Meissner (2010) have also
explored the determinants of sudden stops during the 1880-1913 period using alternatively London gross primary
capital issues and net capital inflows.
11
Anon (1943), p. 25 notes that long-term bond and share issues outside the six centers in our data base were
minimal. For example, it is estimated that 97.7 per cent of Germany’s long-term loans were floated on these six
markets.
12
Limited direct evidence is available on the magnitude and direction of short-term capital flows, the best discussion
of which we are aware being Conolly (1936).
13
Such as, in the U.S. case, the short-term instrument known as trade acceptances, a considerable fraction of which
was purchased by foreign investors in the 1920s (see Lary 1943 and Eichengreen and Flandreau 2012).

domestic investors.14 Finally, there was opportunistic repatriation starting in 1931 of foreign
bonds in default that were bought back at deep discounts. These transactions were economically
and diplomatically contentious; by their nature little is known about their extent.15 Only for a
small handful of countries do we have reasonable reliable estimates of short-term capital flows,
amortization and secondary market transactions. For the United States, for example, studies
undertaken for the U.S. Department of Commerce show amortization payments as running at 20
to 30 per cent of new issues in the boom period 1924-28.16 Transactions in outstanding foreign
securities in U.S. markets ran at lower levels, typically half those of amortization, prior to 19301. Data on short-term capital movements are derived mainly from reports on foreign deposits by
U.S. banks and brokers, coverage of which is incomplete, rendering the resulting series volatile
and of uncertain reliability. For other countries the picture is even more fragmentary.17
For these reasons, we supplement our data for primary bond issues with net capital
inflows obtained from balance-of-payment statistics. Net capital inflows are calculated by adding
the accumulation of gold and foreign exchange reserves to the current account deficit. The
country sample is more limited and less representative, but analysis of net capital flows
nonetheless provides a useful check.
We also construct variables designed to capture potential determinants of capital flows.
Pull factors are proxied by recipient country characteristics: GDP, GDP per capita, GDP growth,
public debt, central government’s budget balance, volume of international reserves, etc. We add

14

There were also some purchases by Americans of outstanding U.S. bonds in the hands of European investors, but
these appear to have been concentrated in the first two or three post-World War I years (being a continuation of
wartime transactions) and thus fall outside our sample period. See Lary (1943).

Although some estimates are available in the German case. See Klug (1993).

17
In addition, our data do not include share issues. This is a minor problem, however, as shares accounted for at
most ten per cent of the total of gross capital issues for foreign residents in the six financial centers under study.
Anon (1943), table 3C, estimates that total share issues on account of European countries reached $642 M. (current)
over 1919-1932, whereas bond issues amounted to $5,889 M. over the same period.

dummy variables for whether countries were exporters of primary products and for whether they
were on the gold standard.18 Push factors include source country real GDP, the volatility of stock
market returns, and long-term interest rates. Finally, we add variables accounting for overall
macroeconomic conditions: GDP growth and trade openness at the aggregate European level.19
Table 1 provides summary statistics for the variables in the dataset, while full details on sources
are given in appendix A.

Capital Surges and Reversals

We begin by describing interwar capital-flow surges and reversals and contrasting them
with recent experience. Figures 1 and 2 show the value of long-term bonds floated by European
countries in six major financial centers from 1919 to 1932 in millions of 1990 US dollars. Issues
are broken down by financial center in Figure 1 and by borrower type (public vs. private sector)
in Figure 2. The surge and stop are both evident. Gross capital exports to European countries
rose sharply starting in 1924 and peaked in 1927. Of all bond issues in the 1924-1928 period,
New York accounts for the largest share (66 per cent), but in addition other markets like London
(16 per cent), Amsterdam (8 per cent), and to a lesser extent Stockholm (5 per cent) played
significant roles. Starting in 1926, private borrowers were responsible for the greatest share of
capital issues.
That new issues in New York on behalf of European borrowers and new European issues
in the major financial centers fell already in 1928 may surprise readers who associate the decline
in lending with the collapse of the New York Stock Exchange and the associated deterioration in

18

Primary exporters are defined as countries whose exports were composed of 75% of primary products at least.
These are constructed using the real GDPs (in constant 1990 dollars) of 15 European countries as well as their
nominal exports converted at market exchange rates and deflated using the US Consumer Price Index (see appendix
A).

U.S. economic and financial conditions. In fact, that the falloff in lending to Europe began
earlier was noted by earlier specialists (viz. Mintz 1951).

We see in Figure 1 that the

phenomenon was not limited to New York and that it disproportionately affected public-sector
borrowers. We return to potential explanations below.
New bond issues declined by 64 per cent in real terms in 1929. This was followed
however by a recovery in 1930, due mostly to loans to the German government and corporations
(in particular, the Young Plan loans). In 1931 gross long-term capital exports collapsed again; in
1932 no new European issues were recorded in New York or London. While almost all major
financial centers participated in this sudden stop, there were a few exceptions. The volume of
bond issues actually rose in Paris and Stockholm between 1927 and 1931, for example. Whereas
Paris had been only a marginal player in the capital-flow surge of the 1920s, it overtook New
York as the leading market for bond issues in the early years of the Great Depression.20 Twentyfive per cent of all European bonds issued in 1929-1932 were floated in Paris. As the New York
and London capital markets dried up in 1929-1932, European governments and firms evidently
turned to Paris and Stockholm to issue new debt. This partial substitution between the main
financial centers attenuated the effects of the sudden stop insofar as all sources of external
funding did not dry up at the same time. This also suggests that the shift in capital flows was
partly driven by factors specific to different financial centers rather than simply to questions
about the solvency of the recipients. Section 5 of the paper will shed some light on the identity of
these financial-center-specific factors.
Figures 3 to 5 compare the capital surge and sudden stop in the European periphery
during 1925-1932 and 2006-2011. Figure 3 first juxtaposes the aggregate ratio of current account
deficit to GDP for the largest (net) capital importers of the two periods: Austria, Germany, and
20

Albeit by a relatively small margin.

9

Hungary in 1925-1932 and Greece, Ireland Italy, Portugal and Spain (the GIIPS) in 2006-2011.21
We set year zero, the peak year for current account deficits, as 1927 and 2008 respectively. The
figure shows that the GIIPS ran larger current account deficits at the peak of the recent boom
than the Central European countries in 1927. However, the subsequent current account
adjustment was more severe in the Great Depression than in peripheral Europe after 2008.
Between 1927 and 1931, the decline in the aggregate current account deficit of Austria, Germany
and Hungary represented 6.0 per cent of their 1927 collective GDP and these countries even ran
current account surpluses as of 1931. By contrast, the current account adjustment experienced by
the GIIPS between 2008 and 2011 was “only” 3.2 per cent of their aggregate 2008 GDP and
these countries still ran current account deficits in 2011. However, the most recent estimate for
2012 suggests that the GIIPS’ current account deficit contracted further in that year so the
adjustment might eventually be of the same magnitude as in Central Europe during the Great
Depression.
A large part of the explanation for the differences in current account adjustments between
the two periods is the extent to which official capital inflows compensated for private outflows.
In the early 1930s official flows took the form of loans for Germany, Austria and Hungary from
foreign governments as arranged by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and central
bank finance of the balance of payments (central bank purchases and sales of gold and foreign
exchange).22 After 2007 they took the form of rescue loans for Greece, Ireland and Portugal
from foreign governments and arranged through the European Financial Stability Facility and
transfers to the affected countries’ central banks through TARGET2, the European Union’s realtime interbank payment system. The analogy, obviously, is direct.
21

These two groups correspond to the largest (net) importers of capital of the 1925-1930 and 2004-2008 period
respectively.
22
On the BIS loans, see Toniolo (2005).

10

Figures 4 and 5 show the aggregate ratios of net private and official capital inflows to
GDP for the main European debtors in 1925-1932 and 2002-2011.23 They confirm that the
reversal in the direction of net private flows was dramatic in both periods. In contrast to gross
capital inflows, net private capital inflows to Central European countries did not rebound in
1930. This indicates that the temporary increase in external loans to German borrowers, in
particular, was outweighed by an increase in capital outflows.24 By 1931 and 2010, net capital
inflows to the European debtors were strongly negative, reflecting capital flight. 25 Evidently, the
decline in private capital inflows to Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain in 2008-2011 was
larger than that experienced by Central European countries in 1927-1931.26 However, the rise in
official inflows was also larger, making the resulting current account adjustment less severe for
the capital importers (at least until 2011). In 2011 indeed, net official inflows to the GIIPS
amounted to 12.4% of their collective GDP and more than compensated for net private outflows
(8.3% of GDP). This explains how these countries could continue to run current account deficits,
at least temporarily, despite the crisis. In 1927-31, in contrast, net official inflows to Austria,
23

In Figure 5, official inflows include TARGET2 positions, loans granted by the IMF, EFSF, EFSM and other EU
governments and changes in the central bank’s reserve assets (see Boeckx, 2012). Note that, since errors and
omissions are excluded, the sum of private and official capital inflows to the GIIPS does not exactly match the
figure for their current account deficit.
24
This is evidence that Germany experienced a growing problem of capital flight, associated with political
instability, the poorly received Austro-German customs union proposal and the Brüning government’s bellicose
stance on the reparations question, well before full-blown financial crisis erupted in 1931. Whether this was capital
flight mainly by foreigners excited by the reparations conflict, as argued by Ferguson and Temin (2003), or by
residents concerned with the condition of domestic banks, as concluded by Schnabel (2004), is not something on
which our data shed light.
25
In their recent study of capital flow waves since the 1980s, Forbes and Warnock (2012) distinguish between four
types of episode: - surges (large increases in gross capital inflows); - stops (large decreases in gross capital inflows);
- flights (large increases in gross capital outflows); and - retrenchment (large decreases in gross capital outflows).
According to this typology, the European capital importers of the 1920s faced a combination of a stop and a flight in
the years 1931 and 1932.
26
The decline in aggregate net private capital inflows to the Austria, Germany and Hungary between 1927 and 1931
represented 8.4% of their 1927 collective GDP. The decline in aggregate net private capital inflows to the GIIPS
between 2008 and 2011 represented 10.1% of their 2008 collective GDP. The sudden stop experienced by Central
European countries in the early 1930s is comparable to that endured by Latin America in the early 2000s. Calvo and
Talvi (2008), table 8.1, find that net capital inflows declined by 8 per cent on average for seven Latin American
countries between 1998 and 2002. The decline was particularly acute for Argentina (19.5 per cent) and Venezuela
(17.4 per cent). See also Calvo, Izquierdo and Talvi (2004).

11

Germany and Hungary amounted to 3.4% of their collective GDP and did not compensate for the
net private outflows (4.2% of GDP). These countries therefore had to shrink their current account
deficits much more severely and, by 1931, transform those deficits into surpluses.27
The decline in private capital inflows to the debtor countries was associated in both
periods with a decline in capital outflows from the European creditors. France, the Netherlands
and Switzerland (the largest capital exporters of the 1925-1930 period) became net importers of
capital in 1931, registering a net private capital inflow of 5.7% of their collective GDP. But this
private capital inflow was offset by an outflow of official capital (change in international
reserves and BIS loans) of 4.4% of their collective GDP. In contrast, Germany (the largest
European capital exporter in the early 2000s) has remained a net exporter of private capital in
2008-2011, but the volume of its private capital exports has declined steadily. And, again, the
decrease in private outflows from Germany has been partly offset by the increase in official
outflows.
To some extent, then, the Eurosystem has provided collective insurance against sudden
stops. In 1929-31, in contrast, Central European countries were forced to rely on their individual
insurance against sudden stops (in the form of international reserves), together with much more
limited international emergency support. These official inflows, although non-negligible, were
not enough to compensate for the private capital outflows.

4.

Pull Factors

Studies of the determinants of capital flows typically distinguish factors specific to the
lending countries and the global financial system (“push” factors) on the one hand and factors

27

Austria, Germany and Hungary all reacted by introducing capital controls in the summer and fall of 1931.

12

specific to the recipient countries (“pull” factors) on the other.28 While much of the literature has
concentrated on pull factors, recent experience has refocused attention on push factors as
determinants of both capital-flow surges and sudden stops (see e.g. Milesi-Ferretti and Tille,
2011, Fratzscher, 2011, Forbes and Warnock, 2012).
We start with pull factors. Our dependent variable for this portion of the analysis is the
(log of the) total amount of borrowing by a given country in all markets in a given year (in
millions of 1990 US dollars). We control for the recipient countries’ economic size (real GDP),
macroeconomic performance (real GDP growth suitably lagged), economic development (lagged
GDP per capita), fiscal and monetary policies (lagged inflation, lagged ratios of public debt to
fiscal revenues, of government budget balance to fiscal revenues, and of international reserves to
imports, along with a gold standard dummy), and position in world trade (primary product
exporter).
Ritschl (2002, 2012) has argued that a special set of pull factors were present in the
German case, encouraging private capital inflows before 1929 and discouraging them thereafter.
Under the Dawes Plan, private foreign lending enjoyed what was known as “transfer protection.”
The mechanism through which reparations were transferred effectively gave commercial credits
first claim on the available foreign exchange and seniority over reparations. That made private
lending to Germany more attractive. Under the Young Plan, which succeeded the Dawes Plan in
1929, this hierarchy of seniority was inverted, making private lending less attractive and
contributing to the sudden stop. To take this argument into consideration, we add a pair of
dummy variables for Germany for the Dawes Plan years (1924-1928) and Young Plan years
(1929-1932). Reflecting the emphasis in Decorzant and Flores (2012) on the role of the League

28

See Fratzscher (2012) for a recent illustration.

13

of Nations in European countries’ access to external capital in the 1920s, we also add a dummy
variable for whether a country previously borrowed under the auspices of the League of Nations.
Our econometric results focus on the period 1924-1932.29 We include year dummies in all
regressions in order to control for time-varying, supply-side factors common to all receiving
countries (push factors).30 Our dependent variable has a large proportion of zeros (33 per cent of
the country-year observations), and a log-linear specification would lead one to omit these
observations.31 A first option for dealing with this problem is to add a small constant ( =1) to the
dependent variable and then to estimate the model with OLS. We report results obtained with
this procedure below. Santos Silva and Tenreyro (2006) suggest however that OLS estimates of
log-linearized models are unreliable and recommend using the Poisson pseudo-maximum
likelihood estimator instead. This estimator provides a simple way to deal with the zeros in the
dependent variable and is well behaved even when the proportion of zeros in the dependent
variable is large (Santos Silva and Tenreyro, 2011).32
Table 2 reports results for an unbalanced panel of 20 countries and nine years estimated
using both procedures, OLS and Poisson, although the latter is preferred. We report results
obtained for the full 1924-1932 period as well as sub-periods corresponding to the surge (1924-

29

Most of the covariates being unavailable before 1924.
We exclude the UK from the sample of recipient countries since the British government and firms did not seem to
rely significantly on international capital markets as a source of funding in this period. Over the 1919-1932 period,
only very small amounts of bonds ($2 million or less) were floated (in 1924, 1927, 1928 and 1929) by British
corporations on the Amsterdam market. No government debt issues were recorded and the data tables for other
financial centers do not include a “United Kingdom” line. We cannot rule out purchases by foreigners of securities
on the London market itself, but we lack data on this.
31
The choice of a log-linear model is justified by the fact that, when expressed in level, the (non-censored part of
the) dependent variable is not normally distributed. By contrast, when expressed in log, the (non censored part of
the) dependent variable is normally distributed.
32
We also estimated the regressions using Tobit and Box-Cox Tobit model (following Han and Kronmal, 2004).
The results were similar to those obtained with OLS. However, the Tobit model is not appropriate when the zeros in
the dependent variable are not due to actual censoring. Santos Silva and Tenreyro (2006) show that Tobit estimates
of log-linear model suffer from the same biases as OLS.

1928) and the stop (1929-1932). Finally, column VII reports results obtained for the 1929-1932
period when the Young Loans to Germany are excluded from the sample.33
Estimates for 1924-1932 suggest that only a few of the standard pull factors were
significant drivers of gross capital flows. We find no evidence that stronger economic growth,
lower inflation, lower budget deficits, or higher international reserves were positively associated
with capital inflows. We only find weak evidence of an association between capital flows and
maintenance of the gold standard (column IV). This result is consistent with the findings of
Obstfeld and Taylor (2003), although it is inconsistent with earlier accounts such as Lary (1943)
which emphasize the facilitating role of gold convertibility in the 1924-28 period.34 There is a
small negative relationship between capital flows and lagged economic growth in column IV, as
if countries having experienced more severe economic disruptions in the past received more
capital thereafter.35 Exporters of primary products also appear to have enjoyed favorable access
to international capital markets.36 By contrast, we find no evidence that countries that previously
issued bonds under the auspices of the League of Nations received more capital in the following
years, other things equal. While the coefficient on the Germany/1929-1932 dummy varies
depending on whether the Young Loans are included in the sample, the results do not seem to
indicate that Germany was a positive outlier before 1929 or a negative outlier thereafter.
Comparing the results for the two sub-periods, it would appear that the negative
association between capital flows and economic growth is only present during the capital surge
33

Information on the amount of the Young Loans is taken from The Economist, 14 June 1930, “Reparations Loans”.
Note that some of our regressions focus specifically on this 1924-28 period and still find no impact of goldstandard membership.
35
The coefficient implies that a 1% increase in a country’s (lagged) economic growth is associated with a 5%
decrease in its bond issues. We return to the question of whether this is true for the period as a whole.
36
Previous authors from Nurkse (1944) to Feinstein and Watson (1995) emphasize the role of improving terms of
trade in attracting capital inflows in 1924-28 and of deteriorating terms of trade in discouraging them thereafter.
While Nurkse’s focus is global, Feinstein and Watson consider specifically the agricultural exporters of Central and
Eastern Europe. We also ran the regressions including the (lagged) change in borrowing countries’ terms of trade as
an explanatory variable but find no association between terms of trade and capital movements.

(1924-1928). A large, negative and significant coefficient on public debt in column VII suggests
that investors discriminated against heavily indebted countries during the sudden stop (19291932) but not during the surge (1924-1928).37 Evidently investors only grew seriously concerned
with debt levels when liquidity dried up and growth rates declined (and turned negative).
Additional evidence of this effect can be found in the breakdown of European bond issues by
Moody’s rating categories (Table 3). The share of borrowing countries, whose governments were
rated in the top two categories (Aaa and Aa) increased in all financial centers in 1929-1932
relative to 1924-1928. This is suggestive evidence that riskier, lower-rated borrowers were being
rationed out of the market during the sudden stop.38 There is a parallel here with recent trends in
the eurozone: spreads on the bonds of high-and low-debt European countries were compressed in
2001-8, the period of the recent capital-flow surge, but investors discriminated very sharply
between high- and low-debt countries after 2008 when liquidity evaporated and growth
collapsed.
We also find that international reserves were negatively associated with capital inflows in
1924-1928. In that period governments borrowed on international capital markets in order to
purchase gold and foreign exchange reserves for the purpose of stabilizing their currencies.
However, international reserves were of little help when the global crisis erupted; there is no
evidence that they attenuated the sudden stop of 1929-1932.
In Table 4 we distinguish between public and private sector borrowers. Pull factors
mattered even less for private than public borrowers. In particular, we find no association

37

The coefficient implies that a one standard deviation decrease in a country’s ratio of public debt to fiscal revenues
is associated with a doubling of bond issues on account of this country.
38
Ratings data are from Flandreau, Gaillard and Packer (2011). These authors find that the level of governments’
external debt is a strong predictor of ratings. We also ran regressions including ratings as an explanatory variable but
the results were inconclusive.

between economic growth, international reserves or being an exporter of primary products on the
one hand and private-sector borrowing on the other hand.
Although several interesting findings emerge from this analysis, pull factors do not
perform very well overall. Many coefficients in Tables 2 and 4 are insignificant at conventional
confidence levels. Only a handful of country-specific variables successfully predict capital
inflows.39 By contrast, after controlling for the pull factors in the regressions run over the 19241932 period, we still find evidence of an effect of the year dummies. Figure 6 plots the
coefficients on the year dummies estimated using the Poisson model (Table 3, column IV). The
figure distinguishes between the statistically significant coefficients (at the 5% level, dark-gray
bars) and the statistically insignificant coefficients (light-gray bars). All coefficients are to be
interpreted relative to 1932, which is the omitted category in the regressions. These year
dummies control for supply-side factors common to all countries in the regressions (push
factors). Thus, the size and significance of the coefficients on the year dummies on Figure 6
suggest an important role for push factors in accounting for the capital-flow surge and
subsequent sudden stop.
We now turn to a more detailed investigation of the push factors in question.

5.

Push Factors

Whereas Section 4 focused on the destination of long-term capital flows, we now ask
what drove the volume of capital exports from the financial centers. Our dependent variable for
this part of the analysis is the log of the value of bonds floated in a given financial center in a
given year, again in millions of 1990 US dollars.

39

The R-square of the OLS regressions in columns I-III is low as well. However, this might be because ordinary
least squares are not appropriate to analyze censored data.

17

Studies of post-1980 sudden stops have emphasized changes in risk perception and
interest rates as determinants of global capital flows.40 To assess whether a similar dynamic was
at play in the 1920s and 1930s, we include long-term interest rates and a proxy for risk in the six
financial centers.41 Long-term interest rates are measured as the yield on long-term domestic
government bonds in each center.42 In the spirit of the recent literature, we use the volatility of
stock market returns (i.e. the annualized standard deviation in monthly returns) as a proxy for
risk. We control for the source country’s size (real GDP), for Europe’s overall economic growth,
and for its openness to trade.43
Table 5 presents regressions run on a balanced panel of six financial centers and twelve
years (1921-1932). Columns I and II report simple pooled estimates, while Columns III and IV
add financial-center fixed effects. Columns II and IV include year dummies to control for timevarying factors common to all financial centers.
Push factors perform better than pull factors in explaining capital flows in this period.
Many of the coefficients in Table 5 are significant at high levels of confidence. After controlling
for time and financial center fixed effects, the model in column IV accounts for 69 per cent of
the variance in the dependent variable. There is no evidence that European growth or openness to
trade boosted bond issues. In contrast, conditions in the major financial centers were strong

40

See, for example, Milesi-Ferretti and Tille (2011), Fratzscher (2012) and Forbes and Warnock (2012).
We estimated the same equations using short-term interest rates and obtained essentially the same results.
42
Ideally we would include a measure of ex ante (expected) real interest rates. However, constructing one requires a
measure of inflation expectations over the same period (often ten or more years until the bond matures). No such
measure is readily available. The plausible proxies, such as forward foreign exchange rates and commodity futures
prices, are for much shorter horizons. It is also plausible that under the gold standard that characterized this period
price levels were expected to follow a random walk (Barsky and Summers 1985), in which case nominal rates are a
perfectly fine stand-in for real interest rates.
43
European growth and trade openness are constructed based on a sample of fifteen continental European countries
(see appendix A). European GDP growth is measured as the annual growth rate of these countries’ aggregate real
GDP (in per cent). European trade openness is measured as the ratio of their aggregate exports to their aggregate
GDP (in %). Milesi-Ferretti and Tille (2011), p. 314 also control for global growth and trade openness in their timeseries analysis of global capital flows. Forbes and Warnock (2012) include global growth in their list of the global
factors explaining extreme capital flow events.
41

drivers of capital flows. In particular, we find a strongly negative and statistically significant
relationship between capital issues on the one hand and stock market volatility and interest rates
on the other. Evidently, risk perceptions and the cost of capital in international capital markets
mattered importantly for the volume of new bonds issued. These effects are also large. Earlier
studies (e.g. Royal Institute of International Affairs 1937, Lary 1943, Bloomfield, 1950) placed
considerable emphasis on the influence of these interest rates; by comparison, we have been able
to find less commentary on the role of volatility.
Including a dummy variable for New York in 1929 does not alter the estimates; these
results are not driven entirely by the peak in stock market volatility experienced in the US in that
year. Excluding 1921 through 1923, when exceptional postwar conditions prevailed, similarly
does not alter the results. The relationships we document are not, therefore, an artifact of the
early 1920s, when international capital markets and European economies were still recovering
from the war.44
These results point to three explanations for the sudden stop of the late 1920s: higher
interest rates in the main financial centers (New York and London), increased stock market
volatility, or a combination of the two. Figures 7 and 8 show the evolution of long-term interest
rates and stock market volatility from 1921 to 1932 in the three largest markets: New York,
London and Paris. Although interest rates rose slightly in both London and New York in 1929 as
a consequence of increases in the Bank of England’s and Federal Reserve’s discount rates,
Figure 7 suggests that US and UK interest rates were not the principal explanation for the sudden
stop in gross inflows. Long-term interest rates in New York and London declined again in 1930
and remained at low levels in 1931-1932, relative to the experience of the preceding decade,
44

The exceptional nature of capital flows in the immediate postwar period is emphasized by Holtfrerich (1986) and
Feinstein and Watson (1995). Lary (1943) provides a detailed narrative of foreign lending by the United States, the
principal creditor in this period.

19

when capital flows from these two markets remained at a stop. That said, high interest rates may
help to explain the limited participation of Paris in the lending boom of 1924-1928. Because
France was struggling to stabilize its currency for much of this period, Paris experienced high
interest rates relative to New York and London, handicapping its efforts to become a major
financial center. Only after the franc was stabilized in 1926-8 did interest rates decline and Paris
begin competing seriously with other international financial centers.
If interest rates have limited ability to explain the stop in new issues in New York and
London in 1929-1932, heightened perceptions of risk, as captured by stock market volatility, are
a better candidate. The volatility of returns rose sharply in both New York and London in 1929,
coincident with the collapse in lending to European countries. At the same time, stock-return
volatility in Paris declined, causing bond issues to be redirected there. After a temporary decline
in 1930, stock market volatility increased everywhere in 1931. This increase coincided with the
final collapse of lending.
The relationship between stock market volatility and capital flows was particularly
pronounced for the United States. The simple correlation between the volatility of the S&P index
and new foreign issues in New York, in annual data for 1919-1932 is -0.67. Volatility thus
appears to have been the key driver of movements in the value of new capital issues for
European borrowers in the United States. This result resembles findings for the recent period:
Milesi-Ferretti and Tille (2011) and Forbes and Warnock (2012) both conclude that global risk
perceptions have been important determinants of capital flow surges and reversals in the past 30
years. As in 2008, increased risk aversion brought capital flows to a sudden stop after 1928 and
helped to precipitate a global financial crisis.

20

This result also sheds light on contemporary perceptions of foreign lending. Both Harris
(1935) and Nurkse (1944) expressed strong skepticism about international capital flows, arguing
that they were economically and financially destabilizing on balance. Their conclusions were
informed by this interwar experience when, our results suggest, debtor countries were first
inundated by and then starved of foreign capital, due as much to changing conditions in
international capital markets as any changes in local economic circumstances and policies.

6.

The Capital Flow Reversal

The preceding evidence suggests that the sudden stop in gross capital inflows to
European countries was accompanied by capital flight from the borrowers. This phenomenon
peaked in 1931, when the earlier capital importers became large net capital exporters. In this
section we ask whether the magnitude of the reversal in European private capital flows was
related to country-specific characteristics and whether countries could successfully insulate
themselves from the reversal. Given that data on net capital flows are limited to a subset of
countries, we attempt only a simple bivariate analysis. The capital flow reversal is measured as
the change in net private capital inflows between 1930 and 1931 as a percentage of 1930 GDP.
We relate this dependent variable to the average ratio of net capital inflows to GDP between
1925 and 1930, 1930 real GDP growth, the government budget balance as a share of fiscal
revenues, and the ratio of public debt to fiscal revenues.
Few of these variables are good predictors of the severity of the 1931 reversal. Faster
GDP growth and smaller budget deficits appear to have done nothing to ameliorate the severity
of the reversal. We find a weak positive correlation between the magnitude of the 1931 reversal
and the level of public debt. This reflects the large public debts of the capital exporters of the

21

1920s – the UK, Netherlands, Switzerland, and France – which were on the receiving end of the
capital-flow reversal in 1931. Aside from France, these countries had little or no inflation in the
first half of the 1920s, in contrast with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, which had
essentially eliminated their debts through high inflation at the beginning of the decade. 45 In
contrast, the amount of foreign capital received during the surge years (1925-1930) is a good
predictor of the magnitude of the 1931 reversal (Figure 9). Countries relying most heavily on
foreign borrowing were most severely affected by the sudden stop in 1931, in other words.
Finally, we can juxtapose the magnitude of the reversal against the ratio of international
reserves to imports in 1930 and the percentage change in international reserves in 1931. Figure
10 indicates that reserves did not provide much insurance against sudden stops, confirming what
we found for gross capital flows. However, the strong positive relationship between the change
in reserves and the capital-flow reversal in Figure 11 indicates that countries confronted to the
sudden stop reacted by massively selling international reserves in 1931.46 This confirms the
finding by Accominotti (2011) that the capital importing countries of the 1920s experienced
significant exchange market pressure during the global financial crisis of 1931, while capital
exporters faced upward pressure on their currencies.
The overall picture is that there was little a country could do to insulate itself from the
capital flow reversal. Once the reversal was underway, governments and central banks could
attempt to finance it by selling reserves, and the more reserves they had the more they could
finance before being forced to pull the plug and devalue, default and/or impose exchange
controls. Finally, the extent of previous foreign borrowing was strongly correlated with the
45

The present result is to be contrasted with our previous finding for gross capital flows. Those results showed that
public debts were negatively associated with gross capital inflows in the 1929-1932 period. The contrast suggests
that while low levels of public debt may have been perceived positively by foreign investors, this did not prevent
domestic investors from engaging in capital flight in 1931.
46
Whereas countries to which capital flows were redirected accumulated reserves.

22

severity of the 1931 reversal. One policy lesson from this interwar episode is therefore that
countries more dependent on capital inflows are also more vulnerable to their sudden stops and
reversals.

7.

Conclusion

The parallels between capital flow surges and reversals in Europe in the periods leading
up to the two great financial crises of the modern era, the Great Depression and the Global Credit
Crisis, are more than skin deep. In both periods there was a flood of capital from one half of
Europe to the other, as well as to the continent’s recipient half from the rest of the world. There
was neglect by lenders of public debt burdens and their implications for credit worthiness during
the boom and then the sudden rediscovery of sovereign risk once capital dried up. In both
periods, countries that imported foreign finance most liberally during the boom suffered the
largest reversal and most serious dislocations when the surge of capital inflows came to an end.
But recipient-country characteristics explain only a part of trends and fluctuations in
private long-term capital flows in the 1920s and early 1930s. At least as important were
conditions in international capital markets. Among the important factors there was the level of
interest rates, as emphasized in a host of earlier studies, but also perceptions of the riskiness of
the investment environment, as captured by the volatility of equity prices, the same proxy
utilized in studies of the recent period.
Interwar experience thus underscores the extent to which global factors largely
exogenous to conditions in the borrowing countries shaped the capital inflows and outflows to
which European countries were subject. This was a precedent of which European countries in
the period leading up to subprime/global credit crisis of 2007-8 could have usefully taken heed.

Appendix A: Data Sources and Definitions
Gross Long-Term Capital Flows
Gross long-term European bond issues in New York, London, Paris, Amsterdam, Stockholm and
Zurich over 1919-1932 were computed from an anonymous memo in the Ragnar Nurkse papers
at Princeton University’s Mudd Library. The memo gives the total value of long-term bond
issues on account of European countries in each financial center from 1919 to 1932. The
frequency is annual. The data are reported in millions of current US Dollars and were converted
into 1990 constant US Dollars using the US Consumer Price Index in Carter and Sutch (2006),
series Cc2.
Twenty-eight countries stand among the list of European capital recipients in the source (Austria,
Belgium, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Danzig, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany,
Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxemburg, Netherlands, Norway,
Poland, Portugal, Rumania, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, Yugoslavia).
However, regression results in tables 2 and 3 exclude Danzig, Estonia, Iceland, Ireland, Latvia,
Lithuania and Luxemburg, covariates being unavailable for these countries. The UK is also
excluded from the sample of capital recipients (see section 4). More details on the source for
long-term capital flows are given in section 2.

-

Net Capital Flows (Official and Private)
 1925-1931
Annual net capital inflows (official and private) were computed from the different countries’
balance-of-payments statistics and additional sources. For estimates of official flows in the 1920s
and 1930s we combined the change in international reserves as described below with data on
loans through the Bank for International Settlements from BIS Annual Reports and Toniolo
(2005, pp. 108-109). Net private capital inflows were then defined as the sum of the current
account deficit and official capital outflows. Sources for current account deficits are the
following:
Austria: The current account balance is from an internal database of the Austrian National Bank
(data kindly communicated by Clemens Jobst);
Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Finland, Italy, Norway, Poland, Sweden: Mitchell (2007);
France: Sicsic (1993);
Germany: Ritschl (2002), completed by United Nations (1949) for 1924 (this source reports the
balance of current account and gold);
Hungary: Mitchell (2007), completed by United Nations (1949) for 1925;

 2002-2011
Net private and official capital inflows to Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain
during the recent period were computed using balance of payment statistics. The data were
kindly communicated by Jef Boeckx and are originally from Thomson Datastream. We followed
Boeckx (2012)’s methodology and defined net private capital inflows as the difference between
the financial account and the net liabilities of the central bank and government (recorded under
“Other investment”). We defined official inflows as the sum of the net liabilities of the central
bank and government, IMF financing and reserve assets of the central bank.
In order to check our estimate, we also reconstructed the amounts of EU disbursements and
bilateral loans to Greece, Ireland and Portugal (from the websites of the European Commission
and European Financial Stability Facility, and national governments’ sources). These amounts
can be compared with the net liabilities of the government recorded under “other investment” in
the IMF’s balance-of-payment statistics and which includes official loans from the EFSF and
EFSM bilateral government loans. The tables below compare the series for the three countries
which received bailout money in 2010-2012. The two series are very similar, revealing that the
net liabilities of the government of the IMF’s balance of payment statistics are indeed dominated
by EU and bilateral loans. The data reported in the tables are in billions of US dollars.

Inflation
European countries’ annual inflation rates (in %) are from the following sources:
Austria, Czechoslovakia: Mitchell (2007), percentage change in the consumer price index,
completed by League of Nations, Statistical Year-Book for 1923.
Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal,
Spain, Sweden, Switzerland: Michael Bordo’s Financial Crises Database
(available at: https://sites.google.com/site/michaelbordo/home)
Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Romania: Mitchell (2007), percentage change in the
consumer price index;
Hungary: Mitchell (2007), percentage change in the consumer price index, completed by League
of Nations, Statistical Year-Book for 1924.

wholesale price index; 1927-1928: Mitchell (2007), percentage change in the wholesale price
index; 1929-1932: Mitchell (2007), percentage change in the consumer price index.
Public Debts
European countries’ annual amounts of government debt were obtained from a post-war UN
study on public debts during the 1920s and 1930s (United Nations, 1948).
Fiscal Revenues and Expenditures
Statistics for the different countries’ central government revenues and expenditures were
published in the League of Nations’ Statistical Year-Book at an annual frequency as of 1924. We
relied on this source for most countries in the sample (the data from the Statistical Year-Books
were completed with Mitchell, 2007, for Denmark and Finland in 1923, Austria in 1924 and
Switzerland in 1923-1924). Data for France and Portugal are from Mitchell (2007). Germany’s
fiscal revenues and expenditures are taken from Ritschl (2002) and were completed with
Mitchell (2007) for 1924. Data for Italy are from Fua (1969), vol. 3.

International Reserves
Under the gold exchange standard system, central banks were allowed to hold short-term foreign
assets as a complement to gold in their legal reserves (used to back monetary circulation).
International reserves were therefore composed of gold holdings and foreign exchange. Gold
reserves were obtained from a 1943 Federal Reserve volume (Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System, 1943, pp. 521-555). This source reports all European central banks’ gold
holdings during the interwar period. Data for the different countries’ foreign exchange reserves
are from the following sources:
Austria: 1923-1925: League of Nations, Statistical Year-Book, 1926; 1926-1932:
Oesterreichische Nationalbank (1926-1932), Mitteilungen des Direktoriums der
Oesterreichischen Bank, various issues;
Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Switzerland: 1923: League of
Nations, Statistical Year-Book, 1926; 1924-1932: Nurkse (1944);

Imports and Exports
Data for the different countries’ nominal imports and exports are from Mitchell (2007).
Gold Standard
A gold standard dummy (taking value 1 if a country was on the gold standard in a given year)
was constructed using the information provided in Eichengreen (1992, table 7.1, pp. 188-190).
Primary Exporter Dummy
A primary exporter dummy (taking value 1 if a country’s exports were composed of more than
75% of primary products over 1925-1932) was constructed using the information published in
the League of Nations’ Statistical-Year-Book. The League of Nations distinguished between five
classes of commodities: 1. live animals; 2. articles of food and drink; 3. materials, raw or partly
manufactured; 4. manufactured articles; and 5. gold and silver. We define primary products as
commodities belonging to categories 1 to 3. The League of Nations’ Statistical Year-Books do
not display the commodity composition of Finland’s trade but the share of manufactured
products in Finland’s exports is reported in a working paper of the United Nations Statistics
Division (United Nations Statistics Division, 1962).
League of Nations
The League of Nations dummy takes value 1 for countries, which received a League of Nations’
Loan in the 1920s. Information on League of Nations’ Loans is from Decorzant and Flores
(2012). League of Nations countries include Austria (1923-1932), Bulgaria (1926-1932), Danzig
(1925-1932), Estonia (1927-1932), Greece and Hungary (1924-1932).
Ratings
Data on Moody’s annual ratings were kindly communicated by Marc Flandreau and Norbert
Gaillard and are from Flandreau, Gaillard and Packer (2011). The ratings only cover countries
whose governments issued bonds in New York over the period.
Stock Market Volatility
Stock market volatility in New York, London, Paris, Amsterdam, Stockholm and Zurich is
measured as the annualized standard deviation (in %) of monthly returns (in local currency) on
each domestic stock price index. The stock market indices used are the S&P index of all
common stock prices for New York (source: NBER Macro-History Database, series m11025),

50

the UK FTSE all-share index for London (source: Global Financial Data, series _FTASD),
France’s CAC all tradables index for Paris (source: Global Financial Data, series _CACTD),
Netherlands’ all shares price index for Amsterdam (source: Global Financial Data, series
_AAXD), Sweden’s OMX Affärsvärldens general index for Stockholm (source: Global Financial
Data, series _OMXAFGD) and Switzerland’s general stock price index for Zurich (source:
Global Financial Data, series_SPIXD).
Long-Term Interest Rate
Long-term interest rates correspond to the yields on long-term domestic government bonds in the
different financial centers. For New York, we use the annual series of US government bond yield
in Carter et al. (2006, series Cj1192). For London, we use the yield on 2.5% consols (source:
NBER Macro-History Database, series m13041c). For Paris, we use the yield on the French 3%
Rente perpétuelle (source: League of Nations, Statistical Year-Book, completed with Global
Financial Data, series IGFRA10D for 1921-1923). The Dutch long-term interest rate is taken
from International Conference of Economic Services (1934) for 1921-1928 and International
Institute of Statistics (1938) for 1929-1932 and corresponds to the average yield on eight
domestic bonds (initially computed by the Netherlands Bank). We rely on the “long-run yield”
series of the Riksbank’s Database (Historical Monetary Statistics of Sweden, 1668-2008, section:
interest and stock returns, available at http://www.historicalstatistics.org) for Sweden’s longterm interest rate (note that this series perfectly matches the “yield on 7 government bonds”
series reported in the League of Nations’ Statistical Year-Book). Finally, for Zurich, we use the
yield on 3.5% SBB/CFF (Swiss Federal Railways) bonds reported in Swiss National Bank
(2007). The source indicates that this yield “was considered the benchmark for the Swiss capital
market” (p. 11).
European GDP Growth and Trade Openness
European real GDP growth and trade openness were calculated on the basis of the sources
described above for a sample of 15 continental European countries for which data are available
over 1921-1932. The countries in this sample are Austria, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Denmark,
Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland
and Yugoslavia. European real GDP growth is measured as the percentage change in these
countries’ aggregate real GDPs. European trade openness is measured as the ratio of their
aggregate exports to aggregate GDPs (in %). Nominal exports were converted into 1990 constant
US dollars using the US Consumer Price Index in Carter and Sutch (2006), series Cc2.
