    "abstract": "\n\nGiven a European derivative security with an arbitrary payoff function and a corresponding set of\" underlying securities on which the derivative security is based, we solve the dynamic replication problem: find a\" self-financing dynamic portfolio strategy involving only the underlying securities that most closely\" approximates the payoff function at maturity.  By applying stochastic dynamic programming to the minimization of a\" mean-squared-error loss function under Markov state-dynamics, we derive recursive expressions for the optimal-replication strategy that are readily implemented in practice.  The approximation error or \" \" of the optimal-replication strategy is also given recursively and may be used to quantify the \"degree\" of market incompleteness. \" To investigate the practical significance of these  -arbitrage strategies examples including path-dependent options and options on assets with stochastic volatility and jumps. \"\n\n",
