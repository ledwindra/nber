    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper explores national origin differences in the welfare recipiency of immigrants\nto the United States. We develop an economic model of immigration which generates\nimplications about how welfare utilization should vary according to characteristics of the\ncountry of origin. The empirical analysis reveals that a few source country characteristics\nexplain over two-thirds of the variance of welfare recipiency rates across national origin\ngroups, and changes in the average source country characteristics of the foreign-born\npopulation between 1970 and 1980 can account for most of the rise in immigrant welfare use that occurred over the decade.\n\n",
