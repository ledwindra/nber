Introduction

An enduring theme in economics is that asset prices are determined as an appropriately
discounted value of the cash ows. Further, in equilibrium the ex-ante rates of return are
determined by the preferences of the agents and the time-series properties of the cash- ows.
It is well recognized by now that a wide range of general equilibrium models nd it diÆcult
to simultaneously justify key observed features of asset markets data. Shiller (1981) and
LeRoy and Porter (1981) argue that the observed dividend series is too smooth to justify the
observed volatility of the market return (approximately 19% standard deviation per-annum).
Mehra and Prescott (1985), Weil (1989), and Hansen and Jagannathan (1991), document
the serious diÆculties that standard economic models have in explaining the relatively large
equity premium, and the low real risk free rate (approximately 6.5% and 1% respectively).
These results suggest that from the perspective of a representative investor, with reasonably
calibrated CRRA preferences, the systematic risks embodied in aggregate dividends time
series are too small to justify the large equity premium. In addition, it is hard to justify
the relatively high volatility of the market return and the standard empirical nding that
market risk premia seem to vary across the business cycle. In this paper we present a general
equilibrium model where the interaction between dividend growth rates and non-expected
utility preferences (as in Epstein and Zin (1989) and Weil (1989)) reproduces all these asset
markets phenomena.
It is quite standard in the asset pricing literature to model dividends (the fundamental
cash ows in most asset pricing models) as a unit root process or some stationary stochastic
process around a deterministic trend. The resulting model for growth rates, typically, has
the feature that news regarding cash ows alter investors perceptions regarding expected
growth rates only for very short horizons, if any at all. With standard preferences (as in
Mehra and Prescott (1985)), it is not too surprising that investors view such cash ows as
relatively riskless and, therefore, demand small risk-premia for holding it. In this paper we
propose to model uncertainty in cash ow dynamics by decomposing cash- ows into cyclical
and stochastic trend components. This characterization of the data, for which we provide
empirical support, implies that cash- ow news should signi cantly alter the perceptions of
agents regarding expected growth rates for the long run. The typical size of cash ow news
(i.e., its volatility) is quite small, and its impact on expected growth rates even smaller.
However, the fact that such news has a long lasting impact on expected growth rates makes
the capitalized value of the cash- ow quite risky, and one that warrants a large risk premium.
Along with our speci cation for the dividend (consumption) dynamics we also need the
Epstein and Zin (1989) preferences to accommodate separation between risk aversion and
2

the elasticity of substitution parameters. In the absence of separation between risk aversion
and the elasticity of intertemporal substitution, as is the case in time separable expected
utility, there is an important tension between matching the equity premium, the risk-free
rate, and the volatility of stock returns. In particular, with risk aversion greater than one, the
standard model implies the counter-intuitive feature that a positive innovation to expected
growth rate in cash ows implies a reduction in the price of the stock relative to current
dividend. If risk aversion is smaller than one, then the equity market volatility and the
risk premium may potentially be too low. Hence, the Epstein and Zin (1989)-Weil (1989)
speci cation is important to our model just as our departure point for the cash- ow process.
In the simplest version of our model, the growth rate process for dividends is modeled and
estimated in the time-series as an ARMA(1,1) with homoskedastic Gaussian innovations.
This speci cation for growth rates accommodates the possibility that there is a small
predictable component in growth rates. We show that the ARMA(1,1) speci cation for
growth rates can be motivated as an outcome of a simple stochastic trend and cyclical
variation model for the level of the dividends. Note that the risk premia on all assets with
homoskedastic growth rate innovations are constant and do not vary. To allow for timevarying risk premium, we augment the above model by incorporating conditional volatility
in the dividend-consumption growth rate process. This captures the economic idea that
uncertainty regarding growth rates varies across the business cycle. The conditional volatility
of the growth rate process is assumed to follow a simple GARCH(1,1) as in Bollerslev (1986).
We nd considerable support for a GARCH(1,1) volatility process for dividend growth rates.
Given the augmented growth rate process, the Epstein and Zin (1989) preferences, and
the Campbell and Shiller (1988) log-linearization for continuous ex-post returns, we solve
(analytically) for equilibrium asset prices. These solutions make it possible to express the
model's implications for risk premia and volatility of asset returns explicitly in terms of the
preference and growth rate parameters. We use these implications for the risk premia and
asset return volatility to jointly estimate the preference and growth rate parameters. We
nd that our estimates of the preference and growth rate parameters lie in a plausible range.
Based on the estimated parameter values for preferences and the growth rate process, we
nd that the model can produce the observed level of the risk-free rate, the equity premium,
the volatilities of stock returns, dividend-yield, and the risk free rate. In addition, the model
also justi es the common empirical nding that a rise in the price-dividend ratio predicts a
fall in the market risk premium. The ex-post market return in our model is stochastic and
the market return volatility also follows a GARCH(1,1) process|this is consistent with the
evidence provided in a voluminous literature on market return volatility (see for example,
Bollerslev, Engle, and Wooldridge (1988)). We also show that the simpler version of the
3

model where growth rate innovations are homoskedastic can also justify many of the above
mentioned asset pricing the anomalies. Incorporating the e ects of changing uncertainty in
growth rates relative to the homoskedastic case increases the equity premium and the market
volatility by about 20%. Consequently, incorporating time varying volatility of growth rates
in an empirically plausible manner, helps the model justify the asset market phenomena at
lower levels of risk aversion and elasticity of substitution parameters. Our results suggest
that the market compensation for changing economic uncertainty risk is about 1.2% per
annum.
There is voluminous literature that addresses the aforementioned asset market anomalies.
Notable examples, Abel (1990), Abel (1999), Bansal and Coleman (1997), Campbell (1996),
Campbell and Cochrane (1999), Cecchetti, Lam, and Mark (1990), Constantinides (1990),
Constantinides and DuÆe (1996), Hansen, Sargent, and Tallarini (1999), Heaton (1995),
Heaton and Lucas (1996), Kandel and Stambaugh (1991), address various aspects of the
asset market anomalies discussed above. The approaches taken to address these asset
market phenomena include transaction costs, incomplete markets, and time-non-separable
preferences. Note that in the context of frictionless markets, variation in price-dividend ratios
can come about either due to variation in expected growth rates of dividends or variations
in ex-ante rates of return (discount rates). Indeed a recurring theme in this literature is to
ascribe much of the variation in price-dividend ratios to variation in discount rates, where
it is commonly assumed that dividend growth rates are . However, in our model the
main source of the variability in the price-dividend ratios is variation in expected growth
rates. Indeed, we explain many of the aforementioned asset market puzzles with very little
variation in discount rates.
It is natural and perhaps important to ask, what additional evidence, particularly at
the micro level, supports our contention that dividend growth rates have components with
signi cant long run implications. We feel there is considerable micro-level evidence to support
this view, for example, Easton and Zmijewski (1989) and Kormendi and Lipe (1987) show
that news about earnings have signi cant impact on returns and valuation ratios. At an
aggregate level, Barsky and DeLong (1993) argue that the price elasticity of the market
index with respect to dividends is signi cantly bigger than one | implying that the market
price of equity changes signi cantly in response to changes in aggregate dividends. This
impact of fundamental news on asset prices is consistent with our model, where such news
signi cantly alter perceptions about long-term growth rates and hence valuation ratios.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents our model. In section 3 we present a
closed form solution for asset prices. Section 4 presents our estimation results and discusses

An Economic Model for Asset Markets

Consider a representative agent with the following Epstein and Zin (1989) - Weil (1989)
recursive preferences:
1

Ut = f(1 Æ )Ct  + Æ (Et [Ut ]) = g 1
where 0 < Æ < 1 and Æ
1 is the rate of time preference. Let   1 , where  0
is the risk-aversion (sensitivity) parameter, and  0 is the intertemporal elasticity of
substitution. The sign of  is determined by the magnitudes of the risk-aversion and the
elasticity of substitution. In particular if > 1 and > 1 then  will be negative. Note that
when  = 1, that is = (1= ), the abovePrecursive preferences collapse to the standard case
of expected utility, with Ut = (1 Æ) 1j Æj Ct j . Further, when  = 1 and in addition
= 1, we get the standard case of log utility.
The above representative agent maximizes life-time utility subject to the period budget
constraint
Ct + Pt0 #t = d0t #t + Pt0 #t  Wt
Pt0 refers to the vector of asset price per share at date t that o ers a real dividend stream of
d0t j ; j = 1;   1. #t is vector of asset holdings at the end of time-period t 1 (note that
this vector also includes the payo 1 from the risk-free asset). Given the above information
note that at date t the wealth of the agent is Wt . The above budget constraint can also be
written as
(Wt Ct)  Ra;t = Wt
where Wt 0 Ct = 0Pt0#t , equals the amount of capital invested in the asset markets, and
P #
d #
Ra;t = t+1 tP+10 #t+1t+1 t+1 = WWt t+1Ct is the return on portfolio held by the agent. As in Lucas
t
(1978), we normalize the supply of all equity claims to be one and the risk-free asset to
be in zero net supply. In equilibrium, aggregate dividends in the economy, de ned as Dt ,
equal aggregate consumption of the representative agent. That is d0t# = Dt = Ct, where
the vector, # , the aggregate supply of assets, has ones everywhere except for the entry
corresponding to the risk free rate which is zero.
For this economy, Epstein and Zin (1989) show, that the asset pricing restrictions for
asset return Ri;t satisfy,

where we refer to (Pa;t=Ct ) as Zt. An equilibrium for this economy is a solution for Zt
that solves the functional equation (2). Further note that as consumption equals dividends,
Ra;t , the return on the aggregate consumption process, also coincides with the return on
aggregate dividends | that is, the market portfolio. In section 3.2 we make an explicit
distinction between the consumption and dividend processes.
Continuous versions of variables needed to characterize the solution for the model are
written in lower case letters; hence, ln(1+ Ra;t )  ra;t , ln(Gt )  gt , and ln(Zt ) = zt .

The continuous return can be written as ra;t = ln(1 + (Pa;t =Ct )) zt + gt . To derive

2.1 Growth Rate Process
To solve the model we rst need to characterize the growth rate process. The growth rate
process can potentially have large e ects on the implied volatility of the equity return and
the size of the equity premium. For convenience, it will be easier for us, at this stage, to
capture the idea of stochastic trends and cyclical variation in dividends by characterizing
the growth rate process as an ARMA(1,1) process. As shown later, this process for growth
rates can be motivated by assuming that the stochastic trend for the level of dividends
follows an exponential smoothing process and the cyclical component is a standard rst
order auto-regressive process. We subsequently show empirically that the ARMA(1,1) is
a good description of the dividend growth rate. For simplicity, for now, we equate the
dividends and consumption processes and subsequently provide a model that treats them as
separate processes.

(8)

where L is the lag operator. It is assumed that g is stationary, and hence  and ! are
less than one in absolute value. While this standard ARMA(1,1) process characterizes the
dynamics for the growth rate, the relevant state variable that a ects the present values of
cash ows is the conditional mean of this process. The conditional mean of gt at date t 1
is determined by the state variable xt , where

(9)

Using (8) and (9), it follows that xt is an AR(1) process,
xt

(10)

The parameter  determines the persistence of the process, and ! is the smoothing
parameter that a ects the construction of xt . There are two cases of particular interest that
the ARMA(1,1) representation accommodates. If  = !, then the conditional mean of g is
7

a constant, and g is an
process. Second, if ! = 0, then g is a standard AR(1) process.

i.i.d

Et [gt+n ]

Et

[Et (gt n)] = n (

! )t

(11)

Equation (11) shows that if  ! 6= 0, then rational agents will revise their long-run expected
growth rates in the amount stated in (11). If  ! is positive and small then the revision in
long-run expected growth rates is quite small; in the extreme case when  = ! there is no
revision in the expected growth rate at all. The \permanence" of the expectation revision is
determined by  | if it happens to equal one, then the revision in expectation is identical
across all horizons. When  is less than one, the revision is larger for shorter horizons and
almost zero for very long horizons. An interesting case is where the di erence between  and
! is small and positive, and  is large | in this case growth rate news leads to very small
revisions to the long-run expected growth rate.
It is important to note that when  is even slightly bigger than ! the growth rate
process will look very close to an
process | the asset pricing implications, however,
can dramatically di er from the case in which the growth rate is assumed to be
(that
is,  exactly equals !). It is quite likely, that in nite samples, the data on dividend (or
consumption) growth rate by itself may not sharply be able to distinguish across these
di erent cases. It would then seem that the di erent asset pricing implications of these
alternative growth rate speci cations may prove to be valuable in sharper identi cation of
the growth rate process itself. In a similar vein Cochrane and Hansen (1992) argue that
asset markets data provide important information regarding preference parameters.
Barsky and DeLong (1993) use the classic Gordon Growth Formula and an expected
growth rate process with a unit root (equation (10) with  = 1) to document that such
a speci cation can explain uctuations in the market index. Bansal and Lundblad (1999)
consider the ARMA(1,1) speci cation for dividend growth rates (see equation (7)) in an
international context and explore its implications for asset return cross-correlations across
economies utilizing the market return based static-CAPM model.
To allow for time variation in risk premia, we further assume that there is stochastic
volatility in the growth rate dynamics|where, g;t is the stochastic volatility of the growth
rate. Following Bollerslev (1986) we model the stochastic volatility process as a GARCH(1,1).

Shephard and Harvey (1990) provide small sample evidence which shows that with population values of

 = 1, and 1 ! small (! around .9), standard estimation procedures, in nite samples, are biased toward
estimating values of ! equal to one. This suggests that it is diÆcult, in nite samples, to detect permanent
components. We suspect that the same problems are endemic to our case when  is moderately less than
one, and  ! is small.

Solving for Asset Prices

3.1 Solution
As stated earlier to solve the model we need to derive the process for zt  log(Pa;t=Dt ). The
relevant state variables for deriving the solution, in the absence of asset bubbles, are xt and
g;t . To derive a solution for the endogenous variable zt , we substitute (5) for ra;t in (4).
To do so we conjecture that zt = A + A xt + A g;t . This conjecture, along with Euler
equation associated with the market return, (4), are used to solve for the unknown vector of
coeÆcients A = [A ; A ; A ], using the procedure discussed in McCallum (1983). The details
for the solution for these coeÆcients are provided in Appendix A { section 6.1.
The solution coeÆcient for A is,

Note that an
belief that higher expected growth in dividends raises the price-dividend
ratio, would imply that A is positive. With jj < 1 one would require to be bigger than
one to ensure that A is positive. The positivity of A captures the usual intuition of
the textbook Gordon Growth formula that higher expected growth, all else equal, should
increase the valuation. Note that if jj < 1 then the standard expected utility model, with
risk aversion bigger than one (i.e., < 1), would imply that A is negative | a rise in
expected growth rates leads to a fall in the price-dividend ratio.

required is that the innovation in stochastic volatility process is homoskedastic, without this simplifying
assumption, the solution to the model losses it simplicity, and may not be solvable analytically.

The Equity Premium

Given the solutions for A, it is straightforward to derive (shown in section 6.1) the expression
for the return on the aggregate consumption portfolio (recall that for now it coincides with
the market return) from which it follows that the innovation in this return is,
a;t+1

(16)

Also, the conditional covariance between the consumption innovation and the market return
innovation is,
covt (t ; a;t ) = [1 +  A ( ! )]g;t
If asset returns and the pricing kernel are conditionally log-normal, as is the case here,

(17)

Note that B plays a critical role in the determination of
10

the risk premium in equation (17). B , as shown later, is bigger than one, and captures the
impact on long-term expected growth rates in response to innovations in dividend growth
rates. The impact of this persistent component on the equity premium via B can be very
large|implying a large equity premium. Further note that volatility risk is priced and a ects
the risk premium when  6= 1.
To provide intuition regarding the various e ects on the market risk premium, consider
some special cases. First, consider the case of standard time-separable preferences where
 = 1, or equivalently = 1= . From (17) it is evident that the equity premium is
Et [Ra;t+1

2
Rf;t ] = Bg;t

(18)

Note that with expected utility volatility risk is not priced. With  = 1, the innovation in
the market return does not explicitly a ect the innovation in the IMRS { see (6). This is
an outcome of the fact that innovations to stochastic volatility do not a ect the marginal
utility of wealth with expected utility preferences. When  = ! and volatility is constant,
that is, the dividend process is
and consequently B = 1. In this case the risk premium
of the market portfolio is product of the variance of growth rates and risk aversion. Further,
= (1= ) = 1 (hence log utility) ensures that B = 1 even if  6= !, and the resulting market
return is exactly equal to the growth rate process.
Next, consider the more general case where the risk aversion parameter need not equal
the reciprocal of the elasticity of substitution parameter (i.e.,  need not equal 1). In
this case with  = ! (hence B = 1) the equity premium simpli es to Et [Ra;t Rf;t ] =
g;t + (1 )[ A ] w . The e ect of  6= 1 is that volatility risk is priced. An interesting
case is one where  < 0 and B > 1, in which case the magni cation a orded by the term
pre-multiplying g;t can be big enough to generate a large equity premium. This captures
the intuition that small innovations in the growth rate lead to large changes in the market
return, which in turn is positively correlated with the representative agent's consumption.
To hold the market portfolio the agent needs to be compensated for bearing this risk by
being o ered a large equity premium.
Given the expression for the volatility of Ra in (16), note that the geometric equity
premium, the focus of our empirical analysis, is straightforward to derive,

3.1.2

The Risk Free Rate and Volatility

To derive the risk free rate we exploit the Euler condition in (4) and the fact that the pricing
kernel is log-normally distributed. This allows us to derive the following expression for the
risk free rate (details are given in section 6.2 of Appendix A).
= log(Æ) + 1 Et [gt ] + (1  ) Et [ra;t

1 V ar [  g + (1 )r ] (20)
a;t
2 t t
As is standard in most models, a rise in expected growth rates increases the risk free rate
here as well. The volatility of the pricing kernel (the last term in the expression for rf;t ) can
be fairly large if the return to the market volatility is large, which can signi cantly alter the
implications for the level of the risk free rate. Further, if  < 0 a rise in the equity premium
lowers the risk free rate.
The volatility of the risk free rate is determined by the volatility of the expected growth
rate process and the volatility of the conditional variance of dividend growth rate. In
particular, we show that,

B implying growth innovations have bigger impact on market volatility.

3.2 Separating Consumption and Dividends
In this section we model consumption and dividends as separate processes. Note that in what
follows our consumption growth rate process will be identical to that in (7). We augment
this consumption growth rate process with one for dividends. This parsimonious bivariate

12

process allows for imperfect correlation between consumption and dividend growth rates and
captures the fact that dividends are more volatile than consumption.

where c;t and ed;t are uncorrelated. Note that this framework ensures that the gt
process is identical to that discussed earlier in (7), and (9). Moreover, this structure implies
that the conditional variance of t and d;t are g;t and  g;t respectively. The parameter
 is the leverage ratio as in Abel (1999). A meaningful interpretation of  is that it equals
the ratio of the unconditional standard deviation of the dividends and consumption growth
rates. The above structure implies that the R from predicting gt and gd;t given xt
are equal. Further, note that var(d) =  var(c). Since, dividends are more volatile
than consumption  will be bigger than 1. Note that when  = 1 and  = 1, the above
speci cation collapses to the model speci cation discussed earlier in the paper and dividend
growth rates are perfectly correlated with consumption growth rates. Finally, note that the
relevant state variables for deriving asset prices are still xt and g;t
To solve the model, as in the previous discussion, we rst need to compute the solution to
the endogenous variable, zt = log(Pa;t=Ct). The solution to this variable is entirely unchanged
as the consumption process and consequently the IMRS for our model are unaltered by the
introduction of the auxiliary dividend process. However, to compute the market return which
is a claim to the dividend process, we need to solve for zm;t = log(Pm;t=Dt ). The solution
for zm;t (details of which are given in section 6.3.1 in Appendix A) is,

solution for A ;m can be derived (see section 6.3.1 of Appendix A) in an analogous manner
to that discussed in the context of A . Moreover, exploiting the same solution procedures
as in the previous sections one can derive analytical solutions for the equity premium, risk
free rate, market return volatility, and the risk free rate volatility. The derivation for all
these quantities for the above speci cation of the consumption-dividend model is provided
in the Appendix B. The economic intuition in the context of this model is identical to that
discussed in the consumption equal dividend model ( = 1,  = 1) in the earlier sections.
To provide some sense for what drives premiums in this setting, consider the expression
for the equity premium. The return on the market portfolio is rm;t ,

where Bpk = [  + ( 1)B ] and Bm|the beta of the asset with respect to consumption
innovation risk, is (  +  ;m A ;m( !)). Note that with  = 1, and  = 1 this expression
is identical to equation (17) discussed above. There are two sources of systematic risk|the
consumption innovation risk, and the innovation in consumption volatility. Further note
that the systematic risk compensation for these two sources of risk are the expressions in
the squared brackets in equation (25). The endogenously determined beta's of a given asset
to these risks are the analogue of Bm and A ;m respectively. In the context of the market
claim, it is clear that a rise in  or  raises Bm and hence the equity premium.

Empirical evidence

4.1 Data
We construct a monthly series of real dividend growth rates using the CRSP data set.
Speci cally, dividends are imputed from the Value Weighted return on the NYSE including
and excluding dividends. Using the market capitalization rate and the CPI index we
construct a real valued dividend index for monthly observations from January 1927 to
December 1998. The de-seasonalized level of dividend is a trailing 12 month average | this
procedure is similar to that in Bollerslev and Hodrick (1995), Heaton (1995), and Hodrick
(1992). For each date the monthly dividend growth rate is de ned as the continuous growth
rate of this de-seasonalized level of dividends.
The top panel in Table 1 provides summary statistics of the rst 2 moments and rst 2
autocorrelations of the data used in the paper. The table provides information on dividend
growth rate, the Value Weighted return on NYSE, real return on the one-month Treasury

14

Bill, and in ation. Note that the measured real risk free rate is constructed by subtracting
a trailing 12-month moving average of in ation from the nominal one month T-bill rate |
that is subtracting an empirical proxy for expected in ation. All the return series including
in ation are taken from the CRSP data set. The stylized facts discussed in the introduction
are evident in Table 1. That is the continuous mean equity premium and real risk free
rate are 6.5% and .56% respectively, per-annum. The annualized standard deviation of the
market return and the real risk free rate are about 19% and 1% respectively. In our sample
the volatility of the market return is particularly large.
4.2 Cash Flow Dynamics
In Panel A of Table 2 we provide the ARMA(1,1) estimates for the dividend growth rate
process. The AR(1) coeÆcient, , is .965 and the MA(1) coeÆcient, !, is .85. These
correspond quite closely to the type of estimates discussed earlier in motivating the model.
In particular, the null hypothesis of an i.i.d. growth rate process (i.e.,  = !) can be rejected
at conventional signi cance levels using the Andrews and Ploberger (1996) test. We also
report the estimates for the ARMA(1,1) model with GARCH(1,1) stochastic volatility in
the innovations of the dividend growth rate process. Note that the volatility process is
quite persistent with  = 0:983. The innovation in stochastic volatility, determined by the
di erence  !v = 0:032, is quite small. The economic implications of these estimates
for the conditional mean of the growth rate process are: rst, that it is quite persistent,
and second, that the optimal forecast of the conditional mean is revised in the amount of
0:965 0:85 = 0:114 in the direction of the innovation in the growth rate. Analogously, the
volatility forecasts are revised approximately in the amount of  !v . Further, note that
the estimates above imply that the predictable variation (adjusted R ) in the ARMA(1,1)
and its stochastic volatility process are about 14% and 2% respectively | indicating these
processes contain a small predictable component.
An often held view is that the log-levels of consumption and dividends are a random
walk with a drift. Another commonly held view, seen extensively in the RBC literature
(e.g., Kydland and Prescott (1982)), is that aggregate time-series can be meaningfully
decomposed into a trend and business-cyclical components by a lter such as the HP- lter.
Not surprisingly, the asset pricing implications will be signi cantly di erent across these
two alternative characterization of the data. It is not clear, however, that the time series
9

1

1

Andrews and Ploberger (1996) provide a formal test for the hypothesis that  = ! . The test of this
hypothesis is non-standard since under the null that  = ! the AR and MA parameters of the ARMA(1,1)
are separately identi ed only under the alternative. They construct a likelihood ratio test (based on the
quantity sup! LRT (! )) and provide the non-standard asymptotic distribution for this test statistic.
9

15

dynamics of consumption and dividends, in themselves, can speak to which of these two
views is the
one.
For example, in Panel B of Table 2 we decompose, using the HP- lter, the monthly
dividend growth rate series into cyclical and stochastic trend components. In utilizing the
HP lter we used the 'standard' RBC "smoothing" parameter of  = 14400 (see Hodrick
and Prescott (1997) for details). The rst two columns in Panel B provide the rst two
autocorrelations of the growth rate of the trend and cyclical components. The results
indicate that the trend growth rate component is very persistent while the growth in the
cyclical component is not very persistent. The last column, denoted Var-Ratio reports the
relative variance of each component to the overall growth rate variance. The results in
that panel suggest that the growth rate in the "Trend" component is small in size but
very persistent, whereas the growth rate of the cyclical component is quite volatile but not
persistent. Viewed from the perspective of the HP lter, it seems that shocks to the trend
component will signi cantly alter the implications for long run expected growth rates, and
consequently have serious implications for the equity premium and market volatility.
The ARMA(1,1) speci cation used in this paper can also be derived from a speci c trendcycle model for the level of dividends. For example, let log Dt  Yt = Tt + St where Tt is
the trend component and St is the cyclical component. If one assumes that the trend for Y
follows a exponential smoothing process, where Tt = !Tt +(1 !)Yt, and the cyclical part
follows an AR(1) process, with AR(1) parameter of . Then the growth rate gt = Yt Yt
follows an ARMA(1,1) process as discussed in section 2.1. Note that this is one of the many
ways to characterize the trend and cyclical components so that the implied growth rate
process is an ARMA(1,1). This description of the trend and cycle is analogous to the HP
lter which, as opposed to this, is a two-sided lter.
Finally, in Figure 1 we plot the predicted trend growth rate component of the HP ltered
series against the expected growth rate process implied by the estimated ARMA(1,1) process.
The two track each other very well although the ARMA(1,1) is clearly not as smooth as the
HP- ltered trend growth rate, which as stated earlier is a two-sided lter. Overall, the HP
lter implications for the expected growth rate process and the ARMA(1,1) process, despite
some di erences, provides the same broad message|the expected growth rate process is very
persistent.

4.3 Estimation and Asset Pricing Implications
We now turn to the empirical asset pricing implications of the model. We provide estimation
results for the model. Subsequent to that we provide a few calibration experiments designed

16

to highlight the economics of the model.
4.3.1

Estimation Results and Asset Market Implications

Table 3 provides the core estimation results of our models. Panel A in the table depicts the
relevant data statistics. Panels B and C provide the parameter estimates of the exogenous
processes (i.e., the ARMA(1,1)-GARCH(1,1) speci cation), preferences, and asset return
moments of interest. The asset markets data, in addition to the growth rate process, contain
valuable information regarding the growth dynamics itself. Consequently, the preference
parameters (Æ, and ) are estimated in conjunction with the growth rate parameters (,
! ,  , and !v ). These parameters are estimated by exploiting theoretical restrictions derived
earlier on the equity premium, the level of the risk-free rate, the volatility of the market
return and the risk free rate as well as the moment conditions for estimating the growth
rate process as discussed above. Further note that in our estimations the mean per-capita
consumption growth rate is set at 2.4% per annum.
Panel B provides the results for the dividend model for which  = 1 and  = 1, that
is when consumption and dividends are the same. As reported in the rst four columns of
Panel B of Table 3 the estimated  and !, at 0.977 and 0.864 are marginally higher than
their point estimates in Table 2 (where  = 0:965 and ! = 0:851). The estimated preference
parameters imply a risk aversion of 1.88 and an elasticity of intertemporal substitution of
2.87. In terms of the asset pricing implications, the resulting level of the equity premium
and risk free rate are identical to those observed in the data. The standard deviation of the
market return is 19.20%, which is also identical to that observed in the data. The standard
deviation of the ex-ante risk-free rate is 1.3% in the model, which is only slightly higher than
the volatility of the measured real risk-free rate.
In Panel C we estimate the consumption-dividend model detailed in section 3.2. We
choose  equal to 3 and set the conditional correlation between consumption and dividends
to zero (i.e.,  = 0). This choice for the leverage parameter  ensures that we match the
respective volatilities of consumption and dividend growth rates. As stated under
of Table 3, the annualized monthly volatility of consumption is 1.8% comparable to
that in post-war data. Further, the dividend volatility, which is 5.5%, is identical to that in
our entire sample. Note, that the unconditional correlation of consumption and dividend
1

10

Monthly

Statistics

11

As in Campbell and Koo (1997) we have also solved the model using numerical techniques and nd that
the Campbell-Shiller approximation used to derive the approximate analytical solutions provide very good
solutions. All the quantitative results reported for our estimated parameters are very close to that found in
the numerical solutions, as long as we con ne attention to IES parameters less than 3.0 and risk aversion
of less than 10, and choose  which is less than 0.995. Note that the estimated models satisfy all these
restrictions.
11
Note that monthly consumption (non-durables and services) data is available only from 1959. In addition,
10

17

growth rate is only 0.17.
The estimated parameters for growth rate dynamics, given in Panel C of Table 3 are quite
similar to those of Panel B and hence only marginally di erent than those given in Table
2. In this case, the estimated risk aversion at 5.55 is higher, and elasticity of substitution
parameter at 1.94 is lower than that in Panel B. The e ect of increasing  is to lower the
volatility of consumption, consequently to match the observed equity premium a higher risk
aversion is warranted. In terms of asset pricing moments, this model matches entirely the
levels of the risk free rate, the equity premium and the volatility of the market return. The
risk free rate volatility is now 0.51% | somewhat lower than the volatility of our measured
real risk free-rate.
It is worth noting that the di erences between the preference parameter estimates in
Panel B and Panel C are primarily due to di erences in the volatility of consumption growth
rates, as captured by di erent choices of . Lowering the value of  while xing the
volatility of dividend growth rate increases the consumption growth rate volatility. At the
same time the magnitude of A ;m is increasing in  and . Both of these parameters have
rst order e ects on the volatility of the market return. To capture market volatility, a
rise in  accommodates a lower value of to capture market volatility, at the same time
as consumption volatility is lowered, to capture the equity premium a larger risk-aversion
parameter is needed. This explains the di erences in Panel B and C.
12

4.3.2

Additional Asset Market Implications

Table 4 provides some additional implications for the two estimated models in Table 3. First,
it is well known that price-dividend ratios are quite volatile and are very persistent. The rst
three columns demonstrate that the models' predictions regarding the volatility and rst two
autocorrelation of the price dividend ratios are comparable to that in the data. The volatility
of log price-dividend ratios in the data is about 0.32 and 0.26 in the consumption-dividend
model . Further, the rst two autocorrelations of the models' log price-dividend ratios are
essentially identical to those observed in the data.
A well recognized important dimension is that dividend yields predict multi-horizon
returns, where a rise in current dividend yield predicts a rise in future expected returns. Our
model performs quite well in reproducing this important feature of the data. In columns 4-9
13

this choice of  and  also allows us to match the annual volatility of consumption and dividend growth rates
observed for the entire sample 1927-1998. The volatility of the annual dividend and consumption growth
rate, in the data, is 11.49 and 2.92, respectively. Temporally aggregating the monthly growth rate dynamics
based on Panel C in Table 3 the comparable volatilities of annual growth rates (based on Monte-Carlo
simulations) are 9.04 and 3.4 respectively.
12
Our results are not particularly sensitive to the choice of  for values less than 0.3.
13
It is worth noting that excluding the last 5 years in our sample, results in  (p d) being only 0.28.

18

in Table 4 we report these predictability regressions for horizons of 1, 36, and 120 months.
As is evident, the model captures the positive relationship between expected returns and
dividend yields. The slope coeÆcients and the corresponding R 's rise with the return
horizon, as in the data. Further, note that the model based slope coeÆcients are within one
standard error of the estimated coeÆcients in the data. Finally, the unconditional variance
of the equity premium relative to the ex-post return variance in the model is less than 2%.
This is important as it highlights the fact that cost of capital variation in our model is quite
small|variation in price-dividend ratios is primarily due to the small predictable variation
in growth rates.
In the context of this real economy, we can also explore the implications for the term
premia on real bonds | the average one period excess return on an n period discount bond.
The explicit formulas for the real term structure and the term premia are presented in section
6.4 in Appendix A. At our point estimates real bonds have small negative risk premia (about
-0.4% and -1.2% for a 12 and 36 month real bond respectively)| that is, real bonds provide
consumption insurance to agents. This implication of our model for real bonds is consistent
with the evidence provided in Evans (1998) who documents that for in ation indexed bonds
in the U.K. (1983-1995) the term premia is signi cantly negative (less than -2% at 1 year
horizon) while the term premia for nominal bonds is slightly positive. This evidence of
negative term premia on real bonds is consistent with the implications of the model. It is
worth noting that the negative term premia in our model also imply that the large equity
premium in the model is not a by product of a large positive term premia.
There is a large literature which documents that market return volatility displays a
GARCH(1,1) pattern with fairly persistent volatility shocks (see Bollerslev (1986)). Note
that this feature of the data is easily reproduced in our model. Equation (16) implies that
m;t , the market volatility process is

that is the market volatility is also a GARCH(1,1) process the persistence of which is  .
This is displayed in the last column of the table as  ; rm | in the data this persistence
parameter is 0.984 and in the model it is equal to  , 0.983. The magnitude of  at 0.984
in the data is consistent with the evidence provided in Bollerslev, Engle, and Wooldridge
(1988). Further note that innovations to market volatility relative to dividend growth rate
volatility are magni ed by the amount B , which is bigger than 1. Finally, the implications
of the consumption-dividend model for the time-series of the conditional equity premium
are shown Figure 2. As growth rate volatility is high during recessions it follows, from the

4.3.3

Magnitudes of Preference Parameters

The above results make it clear that the consumption-dividend model with risk aversion
parameter of about 5 and an intertemporal elasticity of substitution parameter (henceforth
IES) of around 1.95, can indeed justify a wide range of regularities observed in asset market
data. Campbell (1999) in the context of asset pricing implications with Epstein and Zin
(1991) preferences and homoskedastic consumption growth rate process argues that IES is
quite small in the data. Hall (1978), also reports low magnitudes for the IES. On the other
hand, estimates of the IES by Attanasio and Webber (1989), who also exploit the Epstein
and Zin (1991) framework, are in excess of 2. The IES estimates in Hansen and Singleton
(1984), using market and T-bill returns, are also well in excess of 2. Our estimates of the
IES are close to those in Attanasio and Webber (1989) and are somewhat smaller than in
Hansen and Singleton (1984).
It is perhaps useful to also relate our estimation to that pursued in Epstein and Zin
(1991). Our estimation approach di ers from that in Epstein and Zin (1991) (and the
papers cited in above) in two important ways. First, unlike the approach in these papers we
estimate the preference parameters by imposing theoretical restrictions on the volatility of
asset returns in conjunction with the commonly exploited restrictions on the mean risk-free
rate and equity risk premium. As discussed below, the volatility of asset returns provide
valuable independent information regarding the preference parameters. Second, the Epstein
and Zin (1991) paper provides preference parameter estimates exploiting observed aggregate
consumption growth, but assume that the return on the aggregate consumption portfolio
coincides with the observed value weighted return on the market portfolio. Recall, that in
equation (25) Ra;t , the return on the consumption portfolio, is a critical input into the
IMRS. Given that the time series behavior of Ra;t and Rm;t can be very di erent|
using Rm;t in place of Ra;t will considerably a ect the parameter estimates. In contrast,
this paper estimates preference parameters without making this additional assumption and
imposes the internally consistent theoretical restrictions needed to derive the return on the
aggregate consumption portfolio.
It is also important to note that the standard way to measure IES can lead to considerable
downward bias in estimation. As in Hall (1978), the IES is typically measured by the slope
coeÆcient from projecting date t + 1 consumption growth rate on the date t risk-free rate.

If growth rate innovations are
homoskedastic, that is V ar(g;t ) = 0, then the slope coeÆcient is equal to , the population
value of the IES. However, with stochastic volatility the measured slope coeÆcient is
downward biased relative to the true value of the IES parameter. For example with
population IES of = 3 and = 2 and all other parameters (; !;  ; !v ) set at their
point estimates of Panel B in Table 3 the measured slope coeÆcient would be 0.6. Hence,
the downward bias can be sizable. Further, this is suggestive of the reasons for the di erences
in point estimates across di erent economic environments and data sets. Given the evidence
in Attanasio and Webber (1989) and Hansen and Singleton (1984), and the possibility of
downward bias in standard estimation of IES, it seems that our IES estimates are well within
the realm of plausibility.
Using non-parametric bounds on asset prices, Hansen and Jagannathan (1991), and
Cochrane and Hansen (1992) document that large risk aversion helps in justifying observed
risk premia. Mehra and Prescott (1985) argue that a reasonable upper bound for risk aversion
is around 10. In this sense, our estimates for risk-aversion of about 5.5 are quite low and
reasonable.

Calibration

To generate intuition for the way various parameters a ect the asset prices in our model
we provide some additional sensitivity analysis which are reported in Tables 5-7. In these
exercises we highlight the importance of the small persistent component in conjunction with
the non-expected utility preferences in explaining the asset market puzzles. In addition we
quantify the contribution of stochastic volatility risk in consumption growth rate dynamics
in explaining risk premiums and asset return volatility.
Table 5 provides calibration results for the case in which preferences exhibit non-expected
utility. The results in Panel A are based on growth rate dynamics reported in Panel C of
Table 3 (that is, consumption-dividend model with  = 3 and  = 0) for various values
of and . For a given risk aversion, a rise in the elasticity of substitution increases the
equity premium and market volatility, and at the same time lowers the risk-free rate and its
The expression for the slope coeÆcient follows from recognizing that cov (gt+1 ; rf;t ) = 1 var(xt ) and the
expression for var(rf;t ) given in equation (30) in Appendix A.

volatility. Evidently, higher levels of , for a given level of risk aversion, help the model in
justifying the asset market facts.
Next we explore the importance of stochastic volatility in consumption-dividend growth
rates. Panel B in Table 5 provides results when growth rate dynamics do not exhibit
stochastic volatility (that is, we set  = !v = 0)|the rest of the parameters are held
as in Panel A. A comparison across Panels A and B, with = 5:50 and = 2 shows,
that the equity premium and market volatility without stochastic volatility are about 5.3%
and 16.98% as opposed to 6.4% and 19.20% with volatility risk. Hence, stochastic volatility
risk contributes about 18% to both, equity risk premium and market volatility. Stated
di erently, in the absence of volatility risk our model would require higher risk aversion and
higher elasticity of substitution to justify the observed equity premium and market volatility.
Panel C in Table 5 replicates the analysis above except that  = :965 and ! = :85 |
the univariate point estimates for dividend growth rate dynamics given in Table 2. It can
be easily seen that a higher  for a given and increases the equity premium, lowers the
risk free rate and increases the market return volatility. A comparison of Panel C to Panel
A makes it clear that higher magnitudes of  obviate the need to choose a larger and
to match the asset returns moments of interest. Economically, this is an outcome of the
fact that larger values of  magnify the e ects of small current growth rate news on current
market valuations, as discussed above in section 2.1.
Table 6 provides results for the case in which cash- ow dynamics are i.i.d (that is  = !
and  = !v = 0) and preferences still exhibit the non-expected utility. In this case the
price-dividend ratio is constant. Consequently, the market return volatility mirrors the
volatility of dividend growth rates. Further, the equity premium is small and unaltered by
changing , and the level of the risk free rate is very high. This highlights the importance
of a persistent component in consumption-dividend growth rates which our ARMA(1,1)
speci cation captures.
Table 7 provides results for the standard time-non-separable preferences. Panel A
assumes cash- ow dynamics are and consumption and dividends are perfectly correlated,
as in Mehra and Prescott (1985). Not surprisingly the setup reproduces the well documented
inability of this model to explain asset market data. As the dividend yield is constant in this
speci cation, the market volatility equals the volatility of the consumption-dividend process
for all values of risk aversion.
In Panel B dividend growth rates follow the consumption-dividend ARMA(1,1)GARCH(1,1) speci cation. Note that now the equity risk premium is negative. In
interpreting this result it is useful to recall the expression for A in (13). For values of
(which in this case equals the reciprocal of ) bigger than 1, A is negative | a rise in

expected growth rates lowers the price-dividend ratio. A result of this feature is that when
there is a positive shock to consumption (dividends) there is a negative shock to market
returns. Hence, the covariance between consumption and the market return is negative.
In this case the market insures the agent's consumption and therefore the required equity
premium is negative. This feature underscores the importance of separation between risk
aversion and elasticity of substitution in the context of our preferred model. Overall, the key
message of these tables is that neither non-expected utility nor the ARMA(1,1)-GARCH(1,1)
speci cation for growth rates is suÆcient by itself to explain the asset market data. In our
model the two channels must co-exist if the model is to match the equity premium, the level
of the risk free rate, and the volatilities of the risk free rate and the market return.
Finally, note that our preferred model has quite reasonable magnitudes of risk aversion
(about 5.5) and IES. If one yields on market volatility by a small amount, it is possible to
drive the IES and risk aversion even lower.

Conclusions

In this paper we explore the idea that news about consumption and dividend growth rates
continuously alters perceptions regarding long-term expected growth rates, and that in
equilibrium this feature is important for explaining various asset market anomalies. If
news about dividends has non trivial impact on long-term expected growth rates, then
the capitalized value of this cash- ow would be fairly sensitive to small news. Further,
if dividends are positively correlated with consumption than the dividend cash- ow may
warrant a large equity premium.
We provide empirical support for the view that the observed aggregate consumptiondividend growth process contains a persistent component that imposes long term risks. In
addition, we show that uncertainty of growth rates changes across time|that is, growth
rate volatility is stochastic. We document that the interaction between dividend growth
rate dynamics, which incorporate this idea of long term risks, in conjunction with the
preferences as developed in Epstein and Zin (1989)-Weil (1989) can indeed explain many
outstanding asset market puzzles. In particular, we show that such a model is capable of
justifying the observed magnitudes of the equity premium, the low risk free rate and the
volatility of market return, dividend-yield, and the risk free rate. In addition, the model
is capable of justifying the predictive relation between dividend yields and returns and the
well documented GARCH-type stochastic volatility in ex-post equity returns. In the model
much of the variability in equity prices is due to news about growth rates while variation in
the cost of capital is fairly small.
23

It seems that the framework developed in this paper has sharp implications for costs of
business cycle uctuations and the cross-section of asset returns|we plan to explore these
issues in a separate paper.

rf is the real risk free rate derived by subtracting a trailing 12-month average of in ation () from the
one month T-Bill. rm is the continuous real return on the Value Weighted NYSE taken from CRSP. We

construct a monthly dividend series using the Value Weighted return on NYSE. The de-seasonalized level of
dividends are constructed using a trailing 12 month moving average of real dividends. The statistics reported
above are for continuous (i.e. log) growth rates constructed from this time series for the level of dividends.
The sample period is 1927:01-1998:12. All return data is from CRSP and in ation is CPI based on BLS.
Standard errors are Newey and West (1987) corrected using 12 lags.

In Panel A we provide the data counterpart to the asset moments of interest. Note that rm and rf are the
continuous (i.e., logged) return on the market and the risk-free rate respectively. The equity premium, is
denoted as E [rm rf ]. All standard deviations are annualized monthly standard deviations, that is monthly
p
standard deviations are multiplied by 12  100 and all monthly mean returns are annualized. In Panels B
and C the preference parameters (risk aversion , elasticity of substitution , and discount factor Æ ) and the
ARMA(1,1)-GARCH(1,1) time-series parameters are jointly estimated. The moment conditions used in the
estimation are based on minimizing the di erence between those observed in the data and the corresponding
population moments implied by the model for [E [rm rf ], E [rf ],  2 (rm ),  2 (rf )] in conjunction with the
moments conditions for estimating the dividend growth rate parameters as discussed in Table 2. Panel
B describes the estimation results for a model in which consumption equals dividends. The dynamics for
dividend growth include the ARMA(1,1)-GARCH(1,1) speci cation given in (7). In Panel C, we estimate
the ARMA(1,1)-GARCH(1,1) consumption- dividend model described in section 3.2. We set the leverage
factor of dividends,  = 3 and the conditional correlation between consumption and dividends,  = 0. All
estimations use a two-step GMM procedure with a Newey and West (1987) covariance matrix with 12 lags.

This table provides sensitivity analysis for the e ects and have on asset prices. The calibration results
are based on the consumption-dividend model of equation (23). In Panel A the growth rate dynamics are
based on the parameter estimates in Panel C in Table 3. In Panel B the parameters are the same as in
Panel A except that there is no stochastic volatility in consumption and dividend growth rates | that is,
1 = !v = 0. In Panel C of this table the parameters are the same as in Panel A above except that  = :965
and ! = 0:851 the point estimates of the univariate dividend growth rates described in Table 2.

This table provides sensitivity analysis of the e ect risk aversion has on asset prices under expected utility
preferences. In Panel A consumption and dividend growth rates are i.i.d and are perfectly correlated (i.e.,
! = , and  = 1), there is no volatility risk (i.e., !v = 1 = 0) and  = 3. Panel B provides information
using parameters reported in Panel C of Table 3. In all experiments = :999.

Appendix-A

6.1 C = D Model
Recall that based on section 2.1 the consumption process with stochastic volatility is,

gt+1 = xt + g;t c;t+1
xt+1 =  + xt + ( !)g;t c;t+1
2
2
g;t+1 = 0 + 1 g;t
+ wt+1

(26)

To map this into equations (7), (9), and (12), note that c;t c;t+1  t+1 .
The IMRS (Intertemporal Marginal Rate of Substitution) for this economy.



ln Mt+1 =  ln Æ

gt+1 + ( 1)ra;t+1

Using this IMRS and the standard asset pricing condition that Et [Mt+1 Ra;t+1 ] = Et [exp( ln Æ  gt+1 +
ra;t+1 )] = 1, for Ra;t+1 , where log(Ra;t+1)  ra;t+1 . To derive the solution for the endogenous variable zt
we substitute the approximation ra;t+1 = 0 + 1 zt+1 zt + gt+1 into the standard Euler condition for Ra
2
(see (4), and conjecture that zt = A0 + A1 xt + A2 g;t
).
2
Given the conditional normality of g , x and g;t
, the conditional mean in (4) must equal exp(cy;t +
vary;t =2) = 1, where cy;t is the conditional mean of yt+1  ln(Æ)  gt+1 + rm;t+1 , and vary;t is its
conditional variance. Using the conjectured solution, the approximation for the return, the process for the
state variables, and (4), it follows that the conditional mean cy;t (suppressing all constants) is,



2
[ xt ] + f[1 (A1 xt + A2 1 g;t
)]

and the conditional variance vary;t

where z;t+1 is the innovation in zt+1 , hence,

vary;t = [



2

+ 2 A22 w2

Since cy;t + vary;t =2 must equal zero for all realizations of the state variables, the coeÆcients A can be solved
for by matching the coeÆcients on the state variables. Collecting all terms in asset pricing condition that
involve xt , we can derive a solution for A1 ,



xt + [1 A1 xt

A1 xt + xt ] = 0:

It immediately follows that,

the solution given in (14).
Given the solution above for zt it is possible to derive the return ra as a function of the evolution of the
state variables and the parameters of the model. Suppressing all the constant terms,

ra;t+1 = gt+1 + 1 A1 xt+1

2
A1 xt + 1 A2 g;t

2
A2 g;t

and the one step ahead conditional innovation in the return ra;t+1 is,

ra;t+1

Et [ra;t+1 ] = Bt+1 + A2 1 wt+1 ;

where B = (1 + A1 1 ( ! )]).
Now substituting for ra;t+1 and the dynamics of gt+1 we can re-write the IMRS in terms of the state
variables | referring to this as the pricing kernel. Suppressing all the constants in the pricing kernel,


gt+1 + ( 1)ra;t+1

Et [mt+1 ] =

= Bpk t+1 + (

!) + 1)gt+1 + ( 1)A2 1 wt+1 g

1)A2 1 wt+1

(27)

where Bpk  f  +( 1)(A1 1 ( ! )+1)g = [  +( 1)B ], where recall that B = (1+ A1 1 ( ! )]). The
innovation in a given return and the innovation in mt+1 are critical for determining the risk premium. The
risk premium for the aggregate consumption portfolio ra;t+1 is determined by computing Et (ra;t+1 rf;t ) =
covt [mt+1 Et (mt+1 ); ra;t+1 Et (ra;t+1 )] 0:5vart (ra;t+1 ). Exploiting the innovations in the return ra;t+1
and mt+1 , it follows that,

Et [ra;t+1

2
rf;t ] = B [( Bpk )g;t
] + 1 A2 [(1 )1 A2 w2 ] 0:5vart (ra;t+1 )

2
where vart (ra;t+1 ) = B 2 g;t
+ (1 A2 )2 w2 . Hence in this case B is the of the asset with respect to the
growth innovation and (1 )1 A2 is the with respect to the volatility shock. The terms in the brackets
are the systematic risk-premia for the two common sources of risks in the economy.
The unconditional variance of ra equals:

V ar(ra;t+1 ) = V ar[

xt

+ Bt+1 + A2 (1 1

2
1)g;t
+ 1 A2 wt+1 ]

which implies that

V ar(ra;t+1 ) =

var(xt )
2

+ B 2 V ar(t+1 ) + (A2 (1 1

2
1))2 V ar(g;t
) + (1 A2 )2 V ar(wt+1 )

We can now derive the expression for the risk-free rate and its volatility, as it only depends on the moments
of the consumption process and that of ra;t+1 .

6.2 The Risk Free Rate and its Volatility

To derive the risk free rate start with (4) and plug the risk-free rate for ri .


V art [ gt+1 + (1

)ra;t+1 ]

(28)

subtract (1 )rf;t from both sides and divide by , where it is assumed that  6= 0. It then follows that,
1

rf;t = log(Æ) + Et [gt+1 ] +

(1



)

Et [ra;t+1 rt ]


V art [ gt+1 + (1

To solve the above expression we need an expression for V art [  gt+1 + (1

2
2
V art (mt+1 ) = Bpk
g;t
+ (1 )2 (1 A2 )2 w2

(29)

Further, if the innovation in growth rate process is homoskedastic, the above expression simpli es as w2 = 0.
The unconditional mean of rf;t is derived by substituting the expression for the ra;t+1 risk-premium, and
(29) into (28). This substitution yields,

E (rf;t ) = log(Æ) + E (g) +

(30)

where K2  [  B + (1 )B 2 ] 0:5B 2 = B ( Bpk ) 0:5B 2 . Note that K2 determines the time varying
portion of the risk-premium on ra;t+1 . The portion B ( Bpk ) is due to the leading term in the risk-premium
and the term 0:5B 2 is due to the Jensen's inequality e ect in the continuous risk premium.

6.3 Separating Consumption and Dividends
In this section we augment the above consumption dynamics by a separate dividend process. As the
consumption process will be identical to the one presented above, it follows that the solution for zt and
therefore ra;t+1 and rf;t are completely unaltered. Consequently are focus in this section is solely on the
return on the aggregate dividend process which we interpret to the return on the value weighted market
portfolio.
The speci cs of the consumption-dividend model are as follows:

gt+1 = xt + t+1
gd;t+1 = d + xt + d;t+1
t+1 = g;t c;t+1
p
d;t+1 = g;t c;t+1 + 1  2 g;t ed;t+1
c;t+1 ; d;t+1  N (0; 1)
and corrt (t+1 ; d;t+1 ) = 

(31)

where c;t+1 and ed;t+1 are uncorrelated. Note that this framework ensures that the gt+1 process is identical
to that discussed earlier in (7), and (9). Moreover, this structure implies that the conditional variance of
2
2
t+1 and d;t+1 is g;t
and 2 g;t
respectively. The relevant state variables for deriving asset prices are xt
and g;t .

6.3.1

Market Return and its Volatility

Let the return on the aggregate dividend process be the market return. Then the zi;t = A0;m + A1;m xt +
A2;m t2 , and the innovation in the market return is



A1;m xt + 1;mA2;m t2+1

A2;m t2

The solution for A1;m = 1 1;m  . Further the solution for A2;m can be derived by using the pricing kernel
to price rm;t+1 , that is Et [exp(mt+1 + rm;t+1 )] = 1. Collecting all the x terms we nd that

where Bm = ( + 1;m A1;m ( ! )).
We use the following pricing kernel approach to solve for A2;m ,

expfEt(mt+1 ) + Et (rm;t+1 ) + 0:5V art (mt+1 + rm;t+1 )g = 1

(32)

Now note that

V art (mt+1 + rm;t+1 ) = V art [Bpk t+1 + ( 1)A2 1 wt+1 + Bm t+1 + et+1 + 1 A2;m wt+1 ]

6.4 Term Structure

Let the time t price of an n period maturity discount bond be Qt;n . Consequently, the holding period return
+1;n 1 , so let the time t price of an n period maturity discount bond be Q .
on this bond is Hn;t+1 = QtQ
t;n
t;n
Consequently, that the corresponding continuous return is ht;n = qt+1;n 1 qt;n , where lower case refers
2
to logs. As before, let qt;n = D0;n + D1;n xt + D2;n g;t
. The solution for D1;n follows from exploiting (32)
replacing rm with hn . The di erence equation that arise is,

xt
which implies that D1;n 1 
P
D1;n = 1 nj=01 j for all n
of A1;m .



+ D1;n 1 xt

D1;n xt = 0

(37)

= Dn . With the initial conditions that D1;0 = 0, the solution for
1 that is D1;n = 1 [ 1 1  (1 n )]. Note that D1;n is the bond analog

In a similar fashion the solution for D2;n , follows from
(

1)A2 (1 1

1) + [D2;n 1 1

2
D2;n ] + 0:5Bm;b
(n) = 0

Thus

2
D2;n = ( 1)A2 (1 1 1) + D2;n 1 1 + 0:5Bm;b
(n)
where D2;0 = 0, and Bm;b(n) = [Bpk + D1;n 1 ( ! )], where this is the analogous term to Bm;d above for
equity. Also, note that D2;n is the bond analog of A2;m for equities. Further, note that 1;b = 1 for all

discount bonds of all maturities (for example this is not true for a console).
The term premia on the bond follows

Et [ht+1;n

2
rf;t ] = Bb(n) [ Bpk g;t
] + D2;n [(1 )1 A2 w2 ] 0:5V art (ht+1;n );

(38)

where Bb(n) = D1;n 1 ( ! ). Note that Bb(n) is the bond analog of Bm , that is, it is the of the asset.
To derive the conditional volatility, we rst de ne explicitly the continuous bond return;

ht+1;n = [D0;n 1 D0;n ] + [D1;n 1  D1;n]xt + [D1;n 1( !)]t+1
