    "abstract": "\n\nWhy are contracts incomplete? Transaction costs and bounded rationality cannot be a total explanation since states of the world are often describable, foreseeable, and yet are not mentioned in a contract. Asymmetric information theories also have limitations. We offer an explanation based on \"contracts as reference points\". Including a contingency of the form, \"The buyer will require a good in event E\", has a benefit and a cost. The benefit is that if E occurs there is less to argue about; the cost is that the additional reference point provided by the outcome in E can hinder (re)negotiation in states outside E. We show that if parties agree  about a reasonable division of surplus, an incomplete contract can be strictly superior to a contingent contract.\n\n",
