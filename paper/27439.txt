Scarring Body and Mind: The Long-Term Belief-Scarring Effects of COVID-19

NBER Working Paper No. 27439
June 2020, Revised in October 2020
JEL No. E0,G12
ABSTRACT
The largest economic cost of the COVID-19 pandemic could arise from changes in behavior long
after the immediate health crisis is resolved. A potential source of such a long-lived change is
scarring of beliefs, a persistent change in the perceived probability of an extreme, negative shock
in the future. We show how to quantify the extent of such belief changes and determine their
impact on future economic outcomes. We find that the long-run costs for the U.S. economy from
this channel is many times higher than the estimates of the short-run losses in output. This
suggests that, even if a vaccine cures everyone in a year, the COVID-19 crisis will leave its mark
on the US economy for many years to come.

One of the most pressing questions of the day is the economic costs of the COVID-19
pandemic. While the virus will eventually pass, vaccines will be developed, and workers will
return to work, an event of this magnitude could leave lasting eects on the nature of economic
activity. Economists are actively debating whether the recovery will be V-shaped, U-shaped or
L-shaped.

1

Much of this discussion revolves around condence, fear and the ability of rms and

consumers to rebound to their old investment and spending patterns. Our goal is to formalize
this discussion and quantify these eects, both in the short- and long-run. To explore these
conjectures about the extent to which the economy will rebound from this COVID-induced
downturn, we use a standard economic and epidemiology framework, with one novel channel: a
scarring eect. Scarring is a persistent change in beliefs about the probability of an extreme,
negative shock to the economy. We use a version of Kozlowski et al. (2020), to formalize this
scarring eect and quantify its long-run economic consequences, under dierent scenarios for
the dynamics of the crisis.
We start from a simple premise: No one knows the true distribution of shocks in the economy.
Consciously or not, we all estimate the distribution using past events, like an econometrician
would. Tail events are those for which we have little data. Scarce data makes new tail event
observations particularly informative. Therefore, tail events trigger larger belief revisions. Furthermore, because it will take many more observations of non-tail events to convince someone
that the tail event really is unlikely, changes in tail risk beliefs are particularly persistent.
We have seen the scarring eect in action before. Before 2008, few people entertained the
possibility of a nancial crisis in the US. Today, more than a decade after the Global Financial
Crisis, the possibility of another run on the nancial sector is raised frequently, even though the
system today is probably much safer (Baker et al., 2019). Likewise, businesses will make future
decisions with the risk of another pandemic in mind. Observing the pandemic has taught us
that the risks were greater than we thought. It is this new-found knowledge that has long-lived
eects on economic choices.
To explore tail risk in a meaningful way, we need to use an estimation procedure that does
not constrain the shape of the distribution's tail. Therefore, we allow our agents to learn about
the distribution of aggregate shocks non-parametrically. Each period, agents observe one more
piece of data and update their estimates of the distribution. Section I shows how this process
leads to long-lived responses of beliefs to transitory events, especially extreme, unlikely ones.
The mathematical foundation for such persistence is the martingale property of beliefs. The
logic is that once observed, the event remains in agents' data set. Long after the direct eect
of the shock has passed, the knowledge of that tail event aects beliefs and therefore, continues
to restrain economic activity.

1 See e.g., Summers (FT, 2020), Krugman (2020), Reinhart and Rogo (2020) and Cochrane (2020).

2

To illustrate the economic importance of these belief dynamics, Section II embeds our belief
updating tool in a macroeconomic model with an epidemiology event that erodes the value of
capital. This framework is designed to link tail events like the current crisis to macro outcomes
in a quantitatively plausible way and has been used  e.g. by Gourio (2012) and Kozlowski et al.
(2020)  to study the 2008-09 Great Recession. It features, among other elements, bankruptcy
risk and elevated capital depreciation from social distancing, which separates labor from capital.
Section III describes the data we feed into the model to discipline our belief estimates. Section
IV combines model and data and uses the resulting predictions to show how belief updating
can generate large, persistent losses. We compare our results to those from the same economic
model, but with agents who have full knowledge of the distribution, to pinpoint belief updating
as the source of the persistence.
We model the economic eects of the COVID-19 crisis as a combination of a productivity
decline and accelerated capital obsolescence. We use the well-known SEIR (susceptible-exposedinfected-recovered) framework from the epidemiology literature to model the disease spread.
But, it is the response to the disease that is the source of the adverse economic shock in
our model. Our structure is capable of generating large asset price uctuations, of the order
observed at the onset of the pandemic, and provides a simple mapping from social distancing
policies and other mitigation behavior to economic costs. It also allows us to connect to existing
studies on tail risk in macroeconomics and nance. We present results for dierent scenarios,
reecting the considerable uncertainty about outcomes even in the short-run. Our point is not
to make a forecast of the coming year's events but that that whatever you think will happen
over the next year, the ultimate costs of this pandemic are much larger than your short-run
calculations suggest.
In the rst scenario, GDP drops by about 9% in 2020, recovers gradually but does not go
back to its previous trajectory. It persistently remains about 4% below the previous pre-COVID
steady state.

The discounted value of the lost output is almost 10 times the 2020 drop and

belief revisions account for bulk of the losses (almost 6 times the short-run eect). Greater tail
risk makes investing less attractive, reducing the stock of productive capital and (and therefore,
labor input demand) persistently. In the second scenario, which captures a milder mitigation
response to the spread of the disease, both short- and long-run economic costs are longer, but
the relative importance of belief revisions remains the same.
The model also makes a number of predictions about asset prices. Interestingly, after an
initial shock, credit spreads and equity valuations are predicted to roughly return to their
original level.

This is because rms respond to this increase in riskiness by cutting back on

debt. The eects of scarring are more clearly noticeable in options prices. In scenario 1, for
example, the option-implied third moment in the risk-neutral distribution of equity returns

3

becomes signicantly more negative.
For monetary policy makers, one of the most pressing questions is how belief scarring will
aect the long-run natural rate of interest, often referred to as r-star." Following the onset
of COVID in the U.S., interest rates declined rapidly. A signicant portion of that decline is
related to demand for liquidity. In order to understand how much of that decline was temporary
and how much permanent  and more broadly about the interaction of liquidity and scarring 
we introduce a role for liquid assets in an extension of our baseline model in Section V. When
most capital is only partially pledgeable, but riskless assets are fully pledgeable, riskless assets,
of course have more value. But what we learn is that value is sensitive to tail risk. A persistent
increase in perceived risk from COVID-19 depresses the long-run natural rate of interest by 67
basis points.
Our results also imply that a policy that prevents capital depreciation or obsolescence, even
if it has only modest immediate eects on output, can have substantial long-run benets, several
times larger than the short-run considerations that often dominate policy discussion. Obviously,
no policy can prevent people from believing that future pandemics are more likely than they
originally thought, but policy can change how the ongoing crisis aects capital returns.

By

changing that mapping, the costs of belief scarring can be mitigated. For example, bankruptcies
can lead to destruction of specic investments and a permanent erosion in the value of capital.
Interventions which prevent widespread bankruptcies can thus limit the adverse eects of the
crisis on returns and yield substantial long-run benets. While the short-run gains from limiting
bankruptcies is well-understood, our analysis shows that neglecting the eect on beliefs leads
one to drastically underestimate the benets of such policies.
Of course, future governments could also invest in public health to mitigate the cost of
future pandemics. The ability of such an investment to heal beliefs depends on the nature of
belief changes induced by this episode. If we onlu updated our beliefs about the ability of a
particular type of communicable diseases to disrupt economic activity, then health investments
will be highly eective. However, traumatic events often leave survivors with a more general
sense that unexpected, disastrous events can arise without warning. This more amorphous fear
will be much harder for policy to combat.

Comparison to the literature

There are many new studies of the impact of the COVID-

19 pandemic on the U.S. economy, both model-based and empirical.

Alvarez et al. (2020),

Eichenbaum et al. (2020) and Farboodi et al. (2020) use simple economic frameworks to analyze
the costs of the disease and the associated mitigation strategies. Leibovici et al. (2020) use an
input-output structure to investigate the extent to which a shock to contact-intensive industries
can propagate to the rest of the economy.

Koren and Pet® (2020) build a detailed theory-

4

based measures of the reliance of U.S. businesses on human interaction.

On the empirical

side, Ludvigson et al. (2020) use VARs to estimate the cost of the pandemic over the next few
months, while Carvalho et al. (2020) use high-frequency transaction data to track expenditure
and behavior changes in real-time.

We add to this discussion by focusing on the long-term

eects from changes in behavior that persist long after the disease is gone.
Other papers share our focus on long-run eects. Jorda et al. (2020) study rates of return
on assets using a data-set stretching back to the 14th century, focusing on 15 major pandemics
(with more than 100,000 deaths). Their evidence suggests a sustained downward pressure on
interest rates, decades after the pandemic, consistent with long-lasting macroeconomic aftereects. Reinhart and Rogo (2009) examine long-lived eects of nancial crises. Correia et al.
(2020) nd evidence of persistent declines in economic activity following the 1918 inuenza
pandemic.

A few papers also use beliefs but rely on other mechanisms, such as nancial

frictions, for propagation. Elenev et al. (2020) and Krishnamurthy and Li (2020) propagate the
shock primarily through nancial balance sheet eects. In a more informal discussion, Cochrane
(2020) explores whether the recovery from the COVID-shock will be V, U or L shaped. This
work formalizes many of the ideas in that discussion.
Outside of economics, biologists and socio-biologists have noted long ago that epidemics
change the behavior of both humans and animals. Loehle (1995) explore the social barriers to
transmission in animals as a mode of defense against pathogen attack. Past disease events have
eects on mating strategies, social avoidance, group size, group isolation, and other behaviors
for generations. Gangestad and Buss (1993) nd evidence of similar behavior among human
communities.
In the economics realm, a small number of uncertainty-based theories of business cycles also
deliver persistent eects from other sorts of transitory shocks. In Straub and Ulbricht (2013)
and Van Nieuwerburgh and Veldkamp (2006), a negative shock to output raises uncertainty,
which feeds back to lower output, which in turn creates more uncertainty. To get even more persistence, Fajgelbaum et al. (2017) combine this mechanism with an irreversible investment cost,
a combination which can generate multiple steady-state investment levels. These uncertaintybased explanations are dicult to embed in quantitative DSGE models and to discipline with
macro and nancial data.
Our belief formation process is similar to the parameter learning models by Johannes et al.
(2016), Cogley and Sargent (2005) and Kozeniauskas et al. (2014) and is similar to what is
advocated by Hansen (2007). However, these papers focus on endowment economies and do not
analyze the potential for persistent eects in a setting with production.

I

Belief Formation

Before laying out the underlying economic environment, we begin by explaining how we formalize the notion of belief scarring, the non-standard, but most crucial part of our analysis.
We then embed it in an economic environment and quantify the eect of belief changes from
the COVID-19 pandemic on the US economy.
No one knows the true distribution of shocks to the economy.

All of us  whether in

our capacity as economic agents or modelers or econometricians  estimate such distributions,
updating our beliefs as new data arrives. Our goal is to model this process in a reasonable and
tractable fashion.

The rst step is to choose a particular estimation procedure.

A common

approach is to assume a normal or other parametric distribution and estimate its parameters.
The normal distribution, with its thin tails, is unsuited to thinking about changes in tail
risk. Other distributions raise obvious concerns about the sensitivity of results to the specic
distributional assumption used. To minimize such concerns, we take a non-parametric approach
and let the data inform the shape of the distribution.
Specically, we employ a kernel density estimation procedure, one of most common approaches in non-parametric estimation. Essentially, it approximates the true distribution function with a smoothed version of a histogram constructed from the observed data. By using the
widely-used normal kernel, we impose a lot of discipline on our learning problem but also allow
for considerable exibility. We also experimented with a handful of other kernels.

a result, any changes in beliefs induced by new information are expected to be approximately
permanent. This property plays a central role in generating long-lived eects from transitory
shocks.

II

Economic and Epidemiological Model

To gauge the magnitude of the scarring eect of the COVID-19 pandemic on long-run economic
outcomes, we need to embed it in an economic model in which tail risk and belief changes can
have meaningful eects. For this, a model needs two key features. First, it should have the
potential for `large' shocks, that have both transitory and lasting eects.

The former would

include lost productivity from stay-at-home orders preventing services from reaching consumers.
But for this shock to look like the extreme event it is to investors, the model must also allow for
the possibility of a more persistent loss of productive capital. This loss represents the interior
of the restaurant that went bankrupt, or the unused capacity of the hotel that will not ll again
for many years to come.

When stay-at-home orders forced consumers to work and consume

dierently, it persistently altered tastes and habits, rendering some capital obsolete. One might
think this is hard-wiring persistence in the model. Yet, as we will show, this loss of capital by
itself has a short lived eect and typically triggers an investment boom, as the economy rebuilds
capital better suited to the new consumption normal. We explore two possible scenarios that
highlight the enormous importance of preventing capital obsolescence, because of the scarring
of beliefs.
The second key feature is sucient curvature in policy functions, which serves to make

economic activity sensitive to the probability of extreme large shocks. Two ingredients  namely,
Epstein-Zin preferences and costly bankruptcy  combine to generate signicant non-linearity
in policy functions.
It is important to note that none of these ingredients guarantee persistent eects. Absent
belief revisions, shocks, no matter how large, do not change the long-run trajectory of the
economy. Similarly, the non-linear responses induced by preferences and debt inuence the size
of the economic response, but by themselves do not generate any internal propagation. They
simply govern the magnitude of the impact, both in the short and long run.
To this setting, we add belief scarring. We model beliefs using the non-parametric estimation
described in the previous section and show how to discipline this procedure with observable
macro data, avoiding free parameters. This belief updating piece is not there to generate the
right size reaction to the initial shock.

Instead, belief updating adds the persistence, which

considerably inates the cost.

II.A

The Disease Environment

This block of the model serves to generate a time path for disruption to economic activity, which
will then be mapped into transitory productivity shock and capital obsolescence . Of course,
we could have directly created scenarios for the shocks and arrived at the same predictions.
The explicit modeling of the spread of disease allows us to see how dierent social distancing
policies map into shocks and ultimately into long-term economic costs from belief scarring.
Given this motivation, we build on a very simple SEIR model, which is a discrete-time version
of Atkeson (2020) or Stock (2020), who build on work in the spirit of Kermack and McKendrick
(1927).

To this model, we add two ingredients:

1) a behavioral/policy rule that imposes

capital idling when the infection rate increase (for example, this rule could represent optimal
behavior or government policy); and 2) a higher depreciation rate of unused capital.

While

we normally think of capital utilization depreciating capital, this is a dierent circumstance
where habits, technologies and norms are changing more rapidly than normal. Unused capital
may be restaurants whose customers nd new favorites, old conferencing technologies replaced
with new online technology or oce space that will be replaced with home oces. This higher
depreciation rate represents a speeding up of capital obsolescence.

Disease and shutdowns

On January 20 2020, the rst case of COVID was documented in

the U.S. Therefore, we start our model on that day, with one infected person. Because we are
examining persistence mechanisms, we want to impose a clear end date to the COVID shock.
Therefore, we assume that COVID-19 will be over by the end of 2020. The SEIR model predicts
the evolution of the pandemic. Our policy shutdown rule, maps the infection rate series into a

8

value for the aggregate shock to the US economy in 2020. From 2021 onwards, we assume that
COVID-19 will be over. However, we explore scenarios where the economy may suer other
pandemics in the future.
Time is discrete and innite. For the disease part of the model, we will count time in days,
indexed by t̃. Later, to describe long-run eects, we will change the measure of time to t, which
represents years. There are

(6)

The key part of the epidemic from a belief-scarring perspective is that reducing the contact
rate requires separating labor from capital. In other words, capital is idle. No capital is idled

As mentioned before, this is not physical deterioration

of the capital stock. Instead, it represent a loss of value from accelerated obsolescence due to
changes in tastes, habits and technologies. It could also represent a loss in value because of
persistent upstream or downstream supply chain constraints.

in the economic value of the average unit of capital. A realization of

φ<1

captures the loss of

specic investments or other forms of lasting damage from a prolonged shutdown. This could
come from the lost value of cruise ships that will never sail again, businesses that do not reopen, loss of customer capital or just less intensive use of commercial space due to a persistent
preference for more distance between other diners, travelers, spectators or shoppers. It could
also represent permanent changes in health and safety regulations that make transactions safer,
but less ecient from an economic standpoint.
An important question is whether future investment could be made in ways or in sectors
that avoid these costs. Of course, such substitution is likely to happen to some extent. But, the
fact that the patterns of investment were not chosen previously suggests that these adjustments
are costly or less protable. More importantly, we learned that the world is riskier and more
unpredictable than we thought. The shocks that hit one sector (or type of capital) today may
hit another tomorrow, in ways that are impossible to foresee.

Credit markets and default:

Firms have access to a competitive non-contingent debt mar-

ket, where lenders oer bond price (or equivalently, interest rate) schedules as a function of

rm's shareholders decide whether to repay their obligations or default. Default is optimal for
shareholders if and only if

exchange for a promise to pay one unit of output at date t + 1. Debt is assumed to carry a tax
advantage, which creates incentives for rms to borrow. A rm which issues debt at price qit
and promises to repay bit+1 in the following period, receives a date-t payment of χqit bit+1 , where
χ > 1. This subsidy to debt issuance, along with the cost of default, introduces a trade-o in

For a rm that does not default, the dividend payout is its total available resources, minus
its payments to debt and labor, minus the cost of building next period's capital stock (the
undepreciated current capital stock is included in

Πit ),

plus the proceeds from issuing new

debt, including its tax subsidy

dit = Πit − bit − k̂it+1 + χqit bit+1 .

(10)

Importantly, we do not restrict dividends to be positive, with negative dividends interpreted
as (costless) equity issuance.

Thus, rms are not nancially constrained, ruling out another

potential source of persistence.

Bankruptcy and obsolescence:

Next, we spell out the relationship between default and

This is meant to capture the

idea that widespread bankruptcies can amplify the erosion in the economic value of capital
arising from the primitive shock

This might come from lost supply chain linkages, inter-

8 In our baseline specication, default does not destroy resources - the penalty is purely private. This is not
crucial - it is straightforward to relax this assumption by assuming that all or part of the cost of the default
represents physical destruction of resources.

rm relationships or other ways in which economic activity is inter-connected. For example,
a retailer might ascribe a lower value to space in a mall if a number of other stores go out of
business. Similarly, a manufacturer might need to undertake costly search or make adjustments
to his factory in order to accommodate new suppliers. We capture these eects with a exible
functional form:

Measurement, Calibration and Solution Method

This section describes how we use macro data to estimate beliefs and parameterize the model,
as well as our computational approach. A strength of our theory is that we can use observable
data to estimate beliefs at each date.

Measuring past shocks

Of course, we have not seen a health event like COVID in the last

95-100 years. However, from an economic point of view, COVID is one of many past shocks to
returns that happens to be larger. When we think about COVID changing our beliefs, or our
perceived probability distribution of outcomes, those outcomes are realized returns on capital.
Therefore, to estimate the pre-COVID and post-COVID probability distributions, we rst set
out to measure past capital returns that map neatly into our model.
A helpful feature of capital obsolescence shocks, like the ones in our model, is that their
mapping to available data is straightforward. A unit of capital installed in period

0.50, the ratio of external debt to capital in the US data  from Gourio (2013). Finally, we set
the parameters of the default-obsolescence feedback function, namely µ and $ . Ideally, these

parameters would be calibrated to match the variability of default and its covariance with

implies a default rate of 2%), probably reecting selection. Accordingly, we scaled the Moody's estimates by a
factor of 2 while performing this calculation. We also used estimates of exit and bankruptcy rates from Corbae
and D'Erasmo (2017) and found broadly similar results.

Epidemiology parameters.

A major hurdle to quantifying the long-run eects is the lack of

data and uncertainty surrounding estimates of the short-run impact. While this will surely be
sorted out in the months to come, for now, with the crisis still raging and policy still being set,
the impact is uncertain. More importantly for us, the nature of the economic shock is uncertain.
It may be a temporary closure with furloughs, or it could involve widespread bankruptcies and
changes in habits that permanently separate workers from capital or make the existing stock
of capital ill-suited to the new consumption demands. Since it is too early to know this, we
present two possible scenarios, chosen to illustrate the interaction between learning and the
type of shock we experience. All involve signicant losses in the short term but their long-term
eects on the economy are drastically dierent.
We begin by describing parameter choices that are xed across the scenarios.

to θ̃ = 1/3.

This implies

that a lockdown which reduces the reproduction number to 0.8 is associated with 50% capital
idling. This is broadly consistent with the 25% drop in output, estimated during the lockdown
period in Hubei province, China. The rate of excess depreciation of idle capital at the rate of

In scenario 1, we set

ζI = 300,

which generates an initial

lockdown that lasts for 2 months. This version of the model predicts waves of re-infection and
new lockdowns in the months to come, echoing predictions by the Center for Disease Control.
Scenario 2, which considers a much less aggressive response by setting

ζI = 50,

has only one

lockdown episode.

albeit with slightly smaller magnitudes, as our benchmark economy.

Main Results

Our goal in this paper is to quantify the long run eect of the COVID crises, stemming from
the belief scarring eect, i.e. from learning that pandemics are more likely than we thought.
We formalize and quantify the eect on beliefs, using the assumption that people do not know
the true distribution of aggregate economic shocks and learn about it statistically. This is the
source of the long-run economic eects. Comparing the resulting outcomes to ones from the
same model under the assumption of full knowledge of the distribution (no learning) reveals
the extent to which beliefs matter.
But rst, we briey describe the disease spread, the policy reaction and the economic shocks
these policies generate.

Epidemiology and economic shutdown.

scenarios, as well as the response, which results in capital idling. Recall that Scenario 2 has

The COVID shock is now a second extreme realization of negative capital returns in the last

Scenario-specic parameters are:

φ̃2020 = 0.95.

Observing a tail event like the COVID-19 pandemic changes output in a

persistent way. Figure 3 compares the predictions of our model for total output (GDP) to an

22

identical model without learning. The units are log changes, relative to the pre-crisis steadystate.

In the model without learning, agents are assumed to know the true probability of

pandemics.

As a result, when they see the COVID crisis, they do not update the distribu-

tion. This corresponds to the canonical rational expectations assumption in macroeconomics.
The model with learning, which uses our real-time kernel density estimation to inform beliefs,
generates similar short-term reactions, but worse long-term eects. The post-2020 paths are
simulated as follows:

each economy is assumed to be at its stochastic steady state in 2019

and is subjected to the same 2020

φ̃

shock; subsequently, sequences of shocks drawn from the

estimated 2020 distribution.
The scenarios under learning correspond to what one might call a V-shaped or tilted-V
recession: the recovery after the shock has passed is signicant but not complete. Note that the
drop in GDP on impact is a calibration target  what we are interested in its persistence, which
arguably matters more for welfare.

The graph shows that, in Scenario 1, learning induces a

long-run drop in GDP of about 4%. The right panel shows a similar pattern but the magnitudes
are smaller. Of course, agents also learn from smaller capital obsolescence shocks. These also
scar their beliefs going forward.

But the scarring is much less, producing only a 3% loss in

long-run annual output.
Higher tail risk (i.e.

greater likelihood of obsolescence going forwards) increases the risk

premium required on capital investments, leading to lower capital accumulation. It is important that these shocks make capital obsolete, rather than just reduce productivity, because
obsolescence has a much bigger eect on capital returns than lower productivity does. Labor
also contracts, but that is a reaction to the loss of available capital that can be paired with
labor. When a chunk of capital becomes mal-adapted and worthless, that is an order of magnitude more costly to the investor than the temporary decline in capital productivity. Since
most of the economic eect works through capital risk deterring investment, that lower return
is important to get the economic magnitudes right.

Turning o belief updating

When agents do not learn, both scenarios exhibit quick and

complete recoveries, even with a large initial impact. Without the scarring of beliefs, facilities
are re-tted, workers nd new jobs, and while the transition is painful, the economy returns to
its pre-crisis trajectory relatively quickly. In other words, without belief revisions, the negative
shock leads to an investment boom, as the economy replenishes the lost eective capital. While
the curvature in utility moderates the speed of this transition to an extent, the overall pattern
of a steady recovery back to the original steady state is clear.

This is in sharp contrast to

the version with learning. Note that since the no-learning economy is endowed with the same
end-of-sample beliefs as the learning model, they both ultimately converge to the same

23

levels.

But, they start at dierent steady states (normalized to 0 for each series).

This shows that

learning is what generates long-lived reductions in economic activity.

Decomposing long-run losses.

Next, we perform a simple calculation to put the size of the

long-run loss in perspective. Specically, we use the stochastic discount factor implied by the
model to calculate the expected discounted value of the reduction in GDP. These estimates,
reported in Table 2, imply that the representative agent in this economy values the cumulative
losses between 57% and 90% of the pre-COVID GDP. Most of this comes from the belief scarring
mechanism.

Note that the 1-year loss during the pandemic is 6-9% of GDP. The cost of belief scarring
is ve to six times as large, in both cases. The cost of obsolete capital is about four times as
large as the damage done during the pandemic. Figure 4 illustrates the losses each year from
the capital obsolescence and belief changes. The area of each of these regions, discounted as
one moves to the right in time, is the NPV calculation in the table above. The one-year cost is
a tiny fraction of this total area.

Figure 4: Long-term costs of the pandemic.

Of course, that calculation misses an important aspect of what we've learned  that pandemics will recur.

Since our agents have 70 years of data, during which they've seen one

pandemic, they assess the future risk of pandemics to be 1-in-70 initially.

24

That probability

declines slowly as time goes on and other pandemics are not observed. But there is also the risk
there will be more pandemics, like this. This is not really a result of this pandemic. But that
risk of future pandemics is what we should consider if we think about the benets of public
health investments.

The pandemic cost going forward, in a world where a pandemic has a

probability of occurring each year, is given in Figure 5.

Note that the risk of future

pandemics costs the economy about 7-12% of GDP. This is similar to the one-year cost during
the COVID crisis.

Scenario 2:

In gure 7, we see that the initial reaction of labor is milder than for investment, but
the bigger dierences arise from 2021 onwards. When the transitory shock passes, investment
surges, to higher than its initial level, to compensate for the obsolescence shock.

But labor

remains below the pre-COVID levels, reecting the eect of the scarring eect on the stock of
capital and through that on the demand for labor.

Defaults, Riskless Rates and Credit Spreads.

The scenarios dier in their short-term

implications for default as well. Default spikes only in 2020, the period of impact, returning to
average from 2021 onwards. But, the higher default rate in scenario 1 (6% relative to 4% in
Scenario 2) contributes to greater scarring (since default amplies obsolescence). This result
suggests a role for policy: preventing default/bankruptcy can lead to long-lasting benets. In
Section VI, we present a quantitative analysis of such a policy.
Nearly immediately, after the pandemic passes, default rates in both scenarios return to
their original level. While defaults leave permanent scars on beliefs, the defaults themselves are
not permanently higher. It is the memory of a transitory event that is persistent.
Because defaults were elevated, the pandemic had a large, immediate impact on credit
spreads. However, these high spreads were quickly reversed. Some authors have argued that
heightened tail risk should inate risk premia, as well as credit spreads (Hall, 2016).

the argument is intuitive, it ignores any endogenous response of discounting, investment or
borrowing. A surge in risk triggers disinvestment and de-leveraging. Because rms borrow less,
this lowers default rates back down, which osets the increase in the credit spread. We can see
this channel at work in the drop in debt and the lack of change in long-run defaults (Table 3).
The credit spread is the implied interest on risky debt,

1/qt

less the risk-free rate

rf .

The credit

spread in the stochastic steady state under the 2019 belief is less than a basis point higher is the
post-pandemic long-run. Thus, belief revisions can have signicant and long-lived real eects,
even if the long-run change in credit spreads is very small.

Equity markets and implied skewness.

One might think the recent recovery in equity

prices appears inconsistent with a persistent rise in tail risk. The model teaches us why this
logic is incomplete. When rms face higher tail risk, they also reduce debt, which pushes in the
opposite direction as the rise in risk. Furthermore, when rms reduce investment and capital
stocks decline, the marginal value of capital rises. Finally, when interest rates and thus future
discount rates decline, future equity payments are worth more in present value terms. These
competing eects cancel each other out. In our model, the market value of a dividend claim
associated with a unit of capital is nearly identical under the post-COVID beliefs than under
the pre-COVID ones. In other words, the combined eect of the changes in tail risk and debt
reduction is actually mildly positive. While the magnitudes are not directly interpretable, our
point is simply that rising equity valuations are not evidence against tail risk.
If credit spreads and equity premia are not clear indicators of tail risk, what is? For that, we

This might sound inconsistent with the behavior of the SKEW index reported by the CBOE.
This showed a short-lived spike at the onset of the pandemic, but recovered quite rapidly. To
understand this pattern, note that the SKEW indexes the

by options prices, which is obtained by dividing the third moment from the previous paragraph
by the implied standard deviation (or VIX). Tail events typically lead to a spike in market
volatility, both realized and implied.

This increase in VIX tends to mechanically lower the

skewness. More generally, the SKEW index confounds changes in the third moment with the
changes in the second moment, which often reects many other factors. This is the main reason
why we focus on the (non-standardized) third moment. As we saw, this measure clearly reveals
the persistent change in beliefs and is consistent with evidence from newspapers and surveys in
Barrero and Bloom (2020).

Liquidity and Interest Rates

In this section, we augment the baseline model to include a liquidity friction. This is motivated
by evidence showing liquidity becoming more scarce following the onset of the pandemic  see
Boyarchenko et al. (2020). As we will show, a liquidity motive amplies the eects of tail risk
on rates of return for liquid assets, such as Treasuries. This helps bring this dimension of the
model's predictions closer to the observed drops in recent months. We also present evidence
from bond markets consistent with the rise in liquidity premia.
Recall that, in the baseline model, riskless rates fall in response to higher demand for safe
assets. Just as rms react to the increased tail risk by de-leveraging, investors would like to
protect themselves against low-return states by holding more riskless assets. They cannot all
hold more. Therefore, the price increases (the rate of return falls) to clear the market. Table
3 reports the riskless rate falls by 20 bps (10 bps) in Scenario 1 (Scenario 2). The sign of this
change is consistent with what we saw following the onset of the pandemic, but the magnitude
is not: interest rates, especially in the Treasury market, fell much more dramatically.
We introduce liquidity considerations using a stylized yet tractable specication, in the
spirit of Lagos and Wright (2005).

17

A positive NPV investment opportunity requires liquid

funds. Both capital and government bonds provide liquidity (the former only partially). An
adverse capital obsolescence shock reduces the value of capital and thus the amount of liquidity
it provides. Thus, an increase in the risk of such a shock makes capital liquidity uncertain and
raises the value of riskless bonds, which are always retain their full, liquid value. Thus, higher
tail risk also raises liquidity risk and makes riskless bonds, which serve as liquidity insurance,
even more attractive.

This channel amplies the eect on their return and turns out to be

quantitatively very large. The increased tail risk brought on by the pandemic, combined with
liquidity risk, will turn out to depress interest rates three and a half times as much as in the
model without liquidity risk.
Formally, rms are assumed to have access to a protable intra-period opportunity, yielding

Riskless rates with liquidity premia.

The purpose of this extension was to explore how

liquidity considerations aect scarring-induced changes in riskless rates. To evaluate this, we
compute riskless rates in the stochastic steady states associated with the pre- and post-COVID
beliefs.

These are presented in Table 4.

The model predicts that the yield on liquid bonds

drops by 67 bps in the new steady state. In contrast, the return on a riskless but completely
illiquid asset falls only by 8 bps: in other words, the liquidity premium rises by 59 bps.
The table also shows changes in various market interest rates between January and July
2020. The yield on the 1y and 5y Treasuries were almost

1.4% lower in July 2020 (relative to the

beginning of the year). Note that these are not directly comparable to the model numbers. The
latter compare steady-states and so are most appropriately thought of as long-run predictions
while the current data obviously reect short-term, more transitory considerations as well. We

therefore construct a proxy for the long-run rates using forward rates implied by the Treasury
yield and long-term ination expectations. Specically, we use the instantaneous rate 5 years
forward from the Treasury yield curve and 5y5y ination expectations

19

to calculate the change

in long-term real rates. This shows a decline of about 89 bps, smaller than short-term rates
and closer to the model's predictions.
Next, the table also reports the change in the yield on AAA corporate bonds.

These

securities carry very little default risk, but are not as liquid as Treasuries. As a result, the yield
spread on these bonds relative to Treasuries is often viewed as a proxy for liquidity premia 
see, e.g., Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen (2012) and del Negro et al. (2017). In recent
months, this spread rose by 34 bps, consistent with increased liquidity scarcity.

The model

liquidity premium reported in the table shows a larger rise. This is to be expected since the
model object is dened as the spread of a

completely

illiquid security whereas AAA bonds are

probably partially liquid.
Figure 9 shows the time path of the natural rate of interest.

Notice that the short-run

uctuations are much larger than the long-term eects reported in the table. This is consistent
with short-term market disruptions that are now settling down.
Finally, in interpreting recent data, it is worth pointing out that the last few months have
seen unprecedented policy interventions in bond markets, which almost certainly have contributed to the drop in interest rates on both liquid and illiquid assets  see Boyarchenko et al.
(2020). Our analysis completely abstracts from such interventions

VI

The Role of Financial Policy

The COVID-19 pandemic has sparked an unprecedented policy response.

These responses

fall into three broad categories: social distancing and other mobility restrictions, transfers to
households and nancial assistance to rms. We explored the consequences of more lax social
distance policy in constructing scenarios for our baseline results. Transfers to households has an
important role to mitigate the economic fallout, but does not directly aect productive capacity,
the key object in our analysis. Financial assistance to rms, on the other hand, can help the
economy maintain productive capacity, for example by preventing widespread bankruptcies. In
our setting, such a policy would have benecial long-run eects as well, since they mitigate the
consequences of belief scarring.

In this section, we use our baseline model to quantify these

long-run benets. We nd that the longer-term eects of a policy of debt relief are as much as
10 times larger than the short-run eects.
The need for policy intervention in the model stems from the presence of debt and the
associated risk of bankruptcy.

Bankruptcy is socially costly because it exacerbates capital

obsolescence. Therefore, we model nancial policy as designed to prevent/limit bankruptcies
by reducing rms' eective debt. This could take the form of the government or other policy-

32

maker buying up the debt from private creditors or oering direct assistance to rms. Before
examining the eects of such a policy, we perform a simple exercise to quantify the costs of
bankruptcy in our baseline model. This is the cost that nancial policy might plausibly remedy.

Default feedback increases long-run eects.

Results show with scarring of beliefs (solid line) and without (dashed line), often with the two lines on top of
each other. Common parameters listed in Table 1. Scenario-specic parameters are: Scenario 1:
Scenario 2:

φ̃2020 = 0.90

φ̃2020 = 0.95

Eect of the default-obsolescence feedback.

To understand the role of this feedback

rule, suppose that obsolescence is entirely exogenous, i.e. it does not vary with default. This
amounts to setting

µ=0

in (11). Figure 10 shows the GDP impact of the COVID-19 shock

under our benchmark specication (in the left panel) and without default feedback (in the right
panel). The broad patterns are similar with belief revisions accounting for a signicant portion
of the impact, but the magnitudes are slightly smaller in the right panel (GDP falls by just
under 4% in the long-run, relative to a 5% drop in the benchmark). This dierence between
the two panels is the eect of the the default-obsolescence feedback.

VI.A

Financial Assistance Policy.

We consider a simple policy that prevents bankruptcy by reducing rms' debt burden, specifically a reduction in each rm's debt by 10%.

This in turn mitigates the eective capital

obsolescence and consequently beliefs are slightly less pessimistic going forward. We then simulate the model with these new beliefs and calculate the short- and long-term GDP eects,
reported in Table 5.
The table shows that nancial assistance of this magnitude only saves 1% of GDP in 2020.

No Assistance vs. 10% Debt Reduction

Numbers shown are in percentages of the pre-COVID steady-state

GDP.

From that metric alone, one might judge the cost of the policy to be too high.

21

However, pre-

venting bankruptcies in the short-run also helps reduce losses over time. The present discounted
value of those savings are worth 11% of 2019 GDP. Of that 11%, 7% comes from ameliorating
belief scarring and another 4% comes from the direct eects of limiting capital obsolescence.
This exercise shows that considering the long-run consequences can signicantly change the
cost-benet analysis for nancial policies aimed at assisting rms.

VII

What if we had seen a pandemic like this before?

In our benchmark analysis, pre-COVID beliefs were formed using data that did not witness
a pandemic (though it did have other tail events like the 2008-09 Great Recession).

But,

pandemics have occurred before  Jorda et al. (2020) identify 12 pandemics (with greater than
100,000 deaths) going back to the 14th century. This raises the possibility that economic agents
in 2019 had some awareness of these past tail events and believed that they could happen again.
To understand how this might change our results, we assume that the pre-COVID data sample
includes the 1918 episode. Unfortunately, we do not have good data on capital utilization and
obsolescence during that period,

φ̃t

22

so we simply use the time series for the capital return shock

from 1950-2020 as a proxy for the

φ̃t

series from 1880-1949. In other words, we are asking:

What if we had seen all of this unfold exactly the same way before?
The previous data does not change the short-term impact of the shock. But, it does cut the
long-term eect of in half. Just before the pandemic of 2020 struck, our data tells us that there
has been one pandemic in nearly 140 years. We assess the probability to be about 1-in-140.
After 2020, we saw two pandemics in 141 years. Therefore, we revise our perceived probability

21 Strictly speaking, in our model with a representative agent and lump-sum taxes, there is no real cost
to implementing this policy.

But, obviously, in a more realistic setting with heterogeneity and distortionary

taxation, taking over 10% of corporate debt would entail substantial costs/dead-weight losses.

22 See Correia et al. (2020) and Velde (2020) for analysis of the economic eects of the 1918 over the short-

to medium-term.

34

from 1-in-140 to 2-in-141. That is about half the change in probability, relative to the original
model where the probability rose from zero to 1-in-70.
But considering data from so long ago does raise the question of whether it is perceived as
less relevant. There is a sense that the world has changed, institutions are stronger, science
has advanced, in ways that alter the probability of such events. Such gradual change might
logically lead one to discount old data.
In a second exercise, we assume that agents discount old data at the rate of 1% per year.
In this case, two forces compete. The presence of the 1918 events in the sample reduces the
surprise of the new pandemic as before, albeit with a much smaller weight. The countervailing
force is that when old data is down-weighted, new data is given a larger weight in beliefs. The
larger role of the recent pandemic in beliefs going forward makes belief scarring stronger for
the next few decades. These forces more or less cancel each other out leaving the net results
indistinguishable, in every respect, from the original results with data only from 1950.
Of course, more recently, we saw SARS, MERS and Ebola arise outside the U.S. Other
countries may have learned from these episodes. But the lack of preparation and slow response
to events unfolding in China suggests that U.S. residents and policy makers seem to have
inferred only that diseases originating abroad stay outside the U.S. borders.

VIII

Conclusion

No one knows the true distribution of shocks to the economy. Macroeconomists typically assume that agents in their models know this distribution, as a way to discipline beliefs.

For

many applications, assuming full knowledge has little eect on outcomes and oers tractability. But for unusually large events, like the current crisis, the dierence between knowing these
probabilities and estimating them with real-time data can be large. We argue that a more plausible assumption for these phenomena is to assume that agents do the same kind of real-time
estimation along the lines of what an econometrician would do. This introduces new, persistent dynamics into a model with otherwise transitory shocks. The essence of the persistence
mechanism is this: once observed, a shock (a piece of data) stays in one's data set forever and
therefore persistently aects belief formation. The less frequently similar data is observed, the
larger and more persistent the belief revision.
When we quantify this mechanism, our model's predictions tell us that the ongoing crisis
will have large, persistent adverse eects on the US economy, far greater than the immediate
consequences.

Preventing bankruptcies or permanent separation of labor and capital, could

have enormous consequences for the value generated by the U.S. economy for decades to come.
