    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper derives an estimation procedure which, when the same distributed lag appears twice in an equation to be estimated by least-squares regression, identifies all of the relevant coefficients and lag weights and also constrains the two sets of individual lag weights to be identical. The procedure for solving this identification-constraint problem involves prior imposition of a restriction on the lag weight sum -- i.e., it is necessary to impose the sum restriction before estimating the equation. A further useful feature of the derived procedure is that it facilitates conveniently imposing the sum restriction on all of the weights in a distributed lag even if the leading weight is independent of a polynomial restriction imposed on the others.\n\n",
