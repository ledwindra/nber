Measurement Error and the Flow of Funds Accounts:
Estimates of Household Asset Demand Equations

ABSTRACT

In the household sector of the Flow of Funds Accounts, the difference
between net acquisition of financial assets and net financial savings is
equal to a statistical discrepancy which is often quite large relative to

the reported changes in asset holdings. This means that the budget restrictions emphasized in the Brainard—Tobin approach to specifying asset demand
equations are not satisfied by the data commonly used to estimate such

equations. The view adopted in this paper is that the statistical discrepancy
should be thought of as resulting from measurement error in the Flow of

Funds data. By imposing a structure on the measurement error, a consistent
estimator is developed and used to estimate asset demand equations for the

household sector. The demand equations are similar in specification to
those used by others so that the results allow a direct assessment of the

effects of alternative treatments of the statistical discrepancy. The
empirical results suggest that qualitative conclusions about the effects
of financial flows and interest rates on asset demands are not affected

by the way the statistical discrepancy is treated. Quantitative conclusions
are, however, affected.

Introduction

It i now more than a dozen years since Brainard and Tobin
pu.blished their "Pitfalls" paper warning that financial models must

be specified so as to be conistent with the underlying budget
constraints and wealth identities faced by the agents in the model.
An agent's wealth and the specification of n-i asset demand equations
completely determines the agent's asset behavior in an n asset model.
Brainard and Tobin [1963] drew attention to two important implications

of this fact. First, given wealth, no explanatory variable can
appear in only one asset demand equation. This follows since any
variable which affects the demand for one asset can only cause a

reallocation of the portfolio, since the portfolio size is given by
wealth, and must therefore affect the demand for at least one other

asset. In particular, the sum across all n

equations of

the partial derivatives in each demand equation of an explanatory

variable (other than wealth) must equal zero. From this restriction
the conclusion has been drawn that, in the absence of strong a priori
information, the same set of explanatory variables should appear in

'each equation describing an agent's asset holdings. Second, Brainard
and Tobin noted that the basic stock adjustment formulation, in

which actual asset holdings change in response to a gap between
desired and actual holdings, needs to be generalized in order to be
consistent with the restrictions implied by the budget identity.
Again, the approach followed was to assume that the change in holdings
of any one asset would depend upon the difference for every asset
between desired and actual asset holdings.

2.

The

budget

constraint faced by the economic agent or sector

being modelled has thus been at the heart of the empirical financial

nodels which have followed Brainard and Tobin. Quite commonly,1
this

budget constraint has been stated in flow terms: net acquisi-

tion

of assets minus net acquisition of liabilities equals the change

in wealth. In this form, the Brainard and Tobin framework has been
used in conjunction with data from the Federal Reserve Board7s

Flow of Funds Accounts to estimate asset demand equations for various
sectors of the economy.

One unfortunate aspect of the Flow of Funds data is that, for
most sectors, they fail to satisfy the budget restrictions emphasized

in the Brainard-Tobin approach.2 For example, net acquisition
of financial assets minus liabilities (excluding capital gains) for
the household sector averaged 10.8 billion per quarter for the l96:l

to l978:t. period. This should equal net financial savings (basically
income minus taxes and consumer expenditures).

However, net financial

saving averaged only 7.5 billion per quarter over this same period.
The difference between savings and net acquisition of assets minus

1iabilities, the sector statistical discrepancy in the Flow of Funds
Accounts, averaged -3.2 billion per quarter,

almost half the size of

the total net flow of financial savings. Because the household sector

one sense it is fortunate that the Flow of Funds data are
not forced to satisfy the budget identities; the resulting discrepancies
can alert us to measurement problems which would otherwise be hidden.

3.

is treated a's

the

residual sector in the Flow of Funds Accounts,

the statistical discrepancy is generally largest for this sector.
Since one of the attractions of the Brainard-Tobiri framework is

the set of cross-equation coeffici.ent restrictions imposed by the budget

identity, it is somewhat inconvenient that the data themselves fail

to satisfy the underlying accounting identities. This failure forces
anyone using the Flow of Funds data to make a decision as to how the

statistical discrepancy should be treated. Usually whatever decision
has been made has been accompanied with little discussion of either
the reasons or the consequences. It will' be argued in this paper that
past treatments of the statistical discrepancy have resulted in the
use of estimators which are biased and inconsistent.

The approach adopted in this paper is that the statistical
discrepancy should be thought of as resulting from measurement error

in the Flow of Funds data. This approach is then used to analyze the
implications of alternative treatments of the discrepancy in previous

applied work. This

will

be done in section 2. In section 3, further

assumptions which may be appropriate for the household sector are

used to impose more structure on the measurement error process. This
allows a consistent estimator to be developed that has the additional
advantage that, when all asset demand equations contain the same set
of variables, the coefficient estimates obtained by estimating each
equation separately satisfy the restrictions implied by the budget
identity.
Once a consistent estimator, is

developed,

it remains to be seen

whether or not a proper treatment of the statistical discrepancy

leads to important changes in the parameter estimates obtained in a

model of household asset holdings. To assess then the empirical
importance of accounting in a consistent way for the measurement error
in the data, a model of household asset holdings is estimated using

quarterly data for the l96:l to 1978:)4 period. The model itself is
specified in section L. and the data used in this study are discussed.

I section ,

alternative

estimates of the model are compared. The

paper's conclusions are summarized in section 6.

2.

Previous Treatments of the Discrepancy
In order to evaluate the implications of previous treatments of

the statistical discrepancy in the household sector accounts, it is

necessary to specify a framework of analysis within which alternative
approaches can be considered. The original Brairiard and Tobin paper
and most of the empirical models of household financial behavior using
the Flow of Funds Accounts make the basic assumption that the household

decision making process can be decomposed into two steps. In the
first step, households decide upon levels of consumption and investment

in physical assets. The result of this first step is to produce a
savings flow which must be allocated to the acquisition of financial

assets. The second step in the decision process is to then choose
desired levels of financial assets and liabilities.3 in this stage,
the net change in financial asset holdings is treated as exogenously
determined (in the first stage).
3The joint determination of consumption, physical investment
and financial investment is considered by Walsh [1976], Purvis [1978],
and Eackus and Purvis [1980].

With these relationships in mind, we can now consider the treatment
accorded to dt in previous research.
Three classes of studies have made use of the Flow of Funds

Accounts for the estimation of empirical models of household asset

behavior. The most ambitious have been the attempts to estimate
complete portfolio allocation models for all sectors of the economy.

Three such projects have been carried out: Bosworth and Duesenberry
[1973], Hendershott [1977], and Backus, Brainard, Smith and Tobin

[1980]. Next we have models of the asset holding behavior of one
sector. For the household sector such studies include Motley [1970],

Wachtel [1972], Hendershott and Lmmon [1975], Kopche [1977], Saito
[1977], and Backus and Purvis [1980]. The main focus of this paper
will be on these first two classes of studies, both of which attempt
to estimate equations to explain each

s .

A final group of papers

have studied the demand by households for one particular asset, often
as part of a model of the demand for one asset disaggregated by sectors.
Papers in this final group include Goldfeld [1973], Friedman [1977,
1980], and Roley [1980a, 1980b].

All of the studies which have estimated complete models of
household asset holdings have proceeded along the following lines.

Assume that the net acquisition of asset i is a function of the net
change in total financial asset holdings and a set of r other variables,

If all equations contain the same set of explanatory variables, each

depends upon the inclusion of y =

variables.

With the actual obser,ed values of

y and the s's, Y

does not equal the sum of the sj's. Hence, if each equation were
to be estimated separately, the resulting estimators would fail to

satIsfy the cross-equation restrictions. Theprocedure followed in
all but two of the studies cited above5 has been to use

Despite the measurement errors suggested by the large household
sector statistical discrepancy, all the studies of the portfolio
behavior of households of which I am aware that have utilized the

Flow of Funds data have ignored the problems introduced by such measure

ment error. Only Hendershott [1977]

has

attempted to analyze the

statistical discrepancies in the Flow of Funds accounts. He concludes
that the most likely explanation for movements in the sectorial
discrepancies is that they are due to data errors [pp. 360-361].

Hendershott does not develop the implications of this conclusion
for the estimation methods he uses in [1977] as we have done above.
The implications of the statistical discrepancy as measurement
errór are also important for the approach to financial modelling adopted

by Friedman [1977]. In his work, financial flow variables such as
are viewed as important in determining changes in asset holdings.

This approach has also been used by Roley [1980a, 1980b]. We can
conclude, however, that the estimation methods used in these papers
have produced biased, inconsistent estimates of the impacts of financial
flows on household asset holdings.

In the next section, additional structure will be imposed on the

which will allow a consistent

measurement error in s arid

estimation method for equation (2.6) to be developed.

3. Estimation with Measurement Errors6
Suppose we are interested in estimating equations explaining

the determination of k variables,

where

and

is exogenously determined. If we assume that the same set of

explanatory variables appears in each of the k equations, as in
(2.9), there is no loss of generality if we assume

y is the only

explanatory variable. We thus have k equations of the form

will be relaxed as the discussion proceeds. Assumptions (A.6) and (A.7)
are necessary in order to derive the maximum likelihood estimator of

. It

will be shown that the maximum likelihood estimator in this

model has an interpretation, as an instrumental variable estimator. This
result provides a motivation for the instrumental variable estimator

that will be developed. Once having served that purpose, assumptions
(14.6) and (14.7) can be dropped since the consistency property of the

instrumental variable estimator does not require these assumptions.
• Assumption (14.7) is particularly undesirable, but it is necessary for

the derivation of the maximum likelihood estimator. Hsiao [1976]
points out the inappropriateness of this assumption for most time
series models unless we are dealing with seasonally adjusted, detrended

stationary series. Since the empirical papers cited in the previous
section do not use detrended data, the emphasis here will be on
developing a consistent esatiniator which does not require (14.7).

To motivate the estimation procedure to be developed, however, we
initially assume (14.1) - (14.7).

For the household sector of the Flow of Funds Accounts, each
results from errors in allocating the net acquisition of the ith asset

to the various sectors in the economy. Since the household sector
is the residual sector in the Accounts, u will incorporate errors

originating in all sectors of the Accounts. The error

v , on

the

other hand, arises due to errors in measuring household disposable

income and consumption expenditures. The error in

of this case, see Walsh [1980].

We have so far assumed that all disturbance and measurement

error terms are serially independent. Since this is unlikely to
be the case in any model using time series data, it is necessary
to consider the additional estimation problems which arise when the
error terms are not all serially independent. In (3.lLs.), the error

term

could be serially correlated due to the presence of

serial correlation in either

€jt or any of the ujt's. However,

Brainard and Tobiri's "Pitfallst' methodology applies to the

specification of the properties of the error terms as well as to
the systematic part of each equation; the budget constraint imposes

Model Specification and Data

Because the purpose of this paper is to assess the implications
for the previous work discussed in section 2 of using an estimation
method which attempts to account for the measurement error problem,
a fairly standard specification of the household sector's asset

demand equations will be made. This will allow for some
confidence in relating the conclusions reached here to these
earlier studies.

20.

Almost all of the

empirical

work on household asset holdings

has utilized a generalized stock adjustment framework in which

is the change in wealth during the

terni is included because of the presence of

transaction costs; it is cheaper to allocate new financial flows

than

it is to reallocate existing asset holdings.

In addition to the adjustment equations in (L..i), it is necessary

to specify the determinants of desired asset holdings. It is common
to assume desired holdings are homogeneous of degree one in wealth

and that

=

is

a linear function of interest rates (or

their logs) as well as perhaps other variables such as income.
Friedman [1977] has modified this basic framework to allow for
interaction between the desired asset allocation for asset i,
att , arid the effect of financial flows,
,
by assuming
=
.
The coefficient of
changes as interest rate

changes affect desired holdings of the ith asset. This generalized
adjustment framework has been further developed by Roley [l980a].
The model to be estimated in this paper will be similar to the
original Bra inard-Tobin model, but the stock adjustment model will

not be used to motivate the chosen specification. The stock adjustment
model has the desirable property that it allows certain estimated
coefficients to be interpreted as speeds of adjustment. Unfortunately,

21.

a common problem is that the empirical results usually produce
estimated speeds of adjustment which are too slow to be plausible.

Thus, while the type of equation derived from (.i) seems to "work"
well empirically, it is not necessarily due to the fact that households adjust their portfolios in the manner assumed by the stock
adjustment model.

If we think of a household deciding upon levels of asset holdings
during period t, the household's actions will depend upon the state

variables describing the resources available to the household at the
start of the period and the set of variables, such as interest

rates, describing the characteristics of the assets the household

is considering holding. In the absence of transaction costs, the
household's initial position can be completely characterized by its
wealth at the start of the period plus the assumed exogenous financial

flow zwt •8 Asset demands would therefore depend upon

w_1 +

With no transaction costs, the composition of

is

irrelevant.

When transaction costs are introduced, a dollar in the form of
is not equivalent to a dollar in the form of

A.-i

differential costs are involved in transforming holdings of

and A into any other asset. Now to describe the initial state
of the household, we need to completely specify the composition of

Each

Ati as well as wt will enter the demand

functions for assets in period t. In general then we would have
the more general models considered by Walsh [1976] and
Backus and Purvis [1980], w is also a decision variable of the
household so that the initia' position is characterized by w -

alone.

In the results reported in the next section, household net
acquisition of financial assets is disaggregated into five categories:9

23.

net acquisition of currency and demand deposits (MaN),

time

and

savings accounts (TIME), credit market instruments (BOND), nonznarketable

assets (NONMKT), and net purchases of equities (NErP). Net
acquisition of financial liabilities is disaggregated into two

categories: net acquisition of mortgages (MORT) and net acquisition

of other liabilities (LLE). Corresponding to the variable
in section 3 we have

Since asset stocks also appear in

(li..6)

they were obtained by

decumulating from the end of quarter stocks for l978: using the
seasonally adjusted quarterly flows (MaN, TIME, etc.). This produced
stock series which were consistent with the quarterly flow data.
Asset stocks are labeled SMON, STIME, etc.

Seven interest rates appear in the asset demand equations: a
rate on time and savings accounts (RTIME), the commercial paper

rate (RcP), the Aa corporate bond rate (RBOND), the dividend yield
for the Standard and Poor's 500 (REQIJITY), the rate cn business

loans as a substitute for a consumer loan rate (RBL), the secondary
market yield on FHA insured loans (RMORT), and since asset demands
should depend upon real rates of return, the expected rate of

inflation (EXPINF). This last variable was estimated as the rate
of inflation predicted by a regression of actual inflation on a 10
quarter lag on past inflation, a 10 quarter lag on past rates of
growth of the money supply and a 5 quarter lag on past unemployment
rates.

where SDt is the statistical discrepancy in the Flow of Funds
Accounts for the household sector.

5. Empirical Results
The asset demand equations were estimated over the 196:l to
1978:11. period. Each equation was initially estimated by OLSQ with

as an explanatory variable so the estimated coefficients

l

satisfy the constraints in (11..5). Several of the equations appeared

to have serially correlated residuals, so the procedure discussed

in section 3 was used. This involved regressing the residuals
°'

where the equation deleted (the jth equation) was

the one for net purchases of equities. NETP was very small on
average during the sample period with little variance. The initial
OLSQ estimates of the NETP equation were imprecise with few

coefficients statistically significant. In the remainder of the
analysis, the NETP equation was deleted; estimates for this equation
can be obtained residually from the budget identity and the estimates
of the remaining k-i (in this case, 6) equations.
The regression of

on

produced an estimate of C.

Elements less than one and one-half times their estimated standard

errors were assumed to equal zero. The remaining nonzero elements

of C were used to transform the six equations for s into the
form of (3.21). Because of the zero elements of C, not all
equations now contained the same set of explanatory variables.

25.

Consequently, the equations were estimated jointly using an iterative
version of Zeliner's method for seemingly unrelated equations. The

resulting

a

estimates of the parameters of the asset demand equations

and the jointly estimated elements of C are presented in Table 1.
In interpreting these results, it should be kept in mind that the

explanatory variables are highly correlated. in light of this, it
is surprising that 62 of the 106 estimated coefficients exceeded
1.65 times their estimated standard error.

The responses of asset demands to changes in nominal interest

rates are reported in rows 2-7 of Table 1. Most of the estimated
results conform in sign to a priori expectations, although there

are a number of exceptions. Changes in the rate on time deposits

and savings accounts (RTI), for example, do not appear to have
a significant effect on households acquisitions of currency and
demand deposits (MON), but MON does respond negatively to the
commercial paper rate (RCP) as well as to the corporate bond rate

(RBoN), The positive coefficients on the remaining interest rate
variables (BEQUITY, RBL, and RMORT) are more difficult to interpret.
It is worth noting that these results for the six nominal interest
rate variables are the opposite of those discovered by Backus and
Purvis E1980] who found only the time deposit and savings account

rate to be significant. The own rate on money, minus the expected
rate of inflation, has a negative but statistically insignificant

estimated coefficient. If households respond to real rates of
interest, the coefficient on EXPINFt. wt_i is equal to an own rate

response minus the sum of the coefficients on the other interest

-iis combined effect may be close to zero even if MON

responds to changes in the expected rate of inflation when other real

rates are held constant. From Table 1 the implied response of MON to
EXPINF holding real rates constant is negative, but small (-0.067).
Net acquisition of time deposits and savings accounts depends

positively on the own rate variable, RTI€, and negatively on the rates
on substitutes, RBOND and REQUITY. The coefficient on the commercial

paper rate is small and not statistically significant. Net
acquisition of credit market instruments (BOND) depends positively

on the two own rates, RCP and RBOND, and negatively on RTI and
REQUITY. The coefficient on REQUITY is not statistically significant
(t =

i.1.o),

but it is larger in magnitude than the coefficient on

RTIME. Backus and Purvis
on BOND

but

found a significant positive effect of RBL

that does not show up here, although RBL does appear to

affect TI4E.

As might be expected, net acquisition of nonmarketables (pension fund
reserves, life insurance reserves, savings bonds) is fairly interest

inelastic. Only RBOND and REL have statistically significant
-

coefficients

and their values are relatively small. None of the

interest rate coefficients are large in the equations for LIAB and
MORT either, but several are statistically significant:

REQUITY, and RBL

in

in the equation for LIAB, RTI, REOND,

RTIr€,

and RBL

the equation for MORT. RBL is estimated to have a positive, rather

than the expected negative, effect on LIAB.

These results suggest that asset holdings of the household sector
are responsive to changes in interest rates, but the magnitudes
involved are small.

28.

Turning to the coefficients on the lagged stock variables, Table 1
shows that in only three of the six estimated equations (MON, BOND,

and LIAB) is the coefficient on the own lagged stock negative and
statistically significant as would be implied under a stock adjustment

interpretation. The estimated coefficients on the lagged stocks
differ considerably within each equation which is consistent with
asset demands depending upon the household's initial portfolio
Composition and not just its size (wt_i) as would be the case in
the absence of transaction costs.

While income (PDY) is statistically significant oriiy in the MON
and NONMKT equations, the financial flow variable w is significant

in all but the BOND equation. According to Table 1, 17 cents of a
dollar increase in wealth is initially allocated to money holdings
and 22 cents to time deposits and savings accounts although the
biggest flow (31 cents) is into the nonrnarketable category. In

addition, total liabilities are reduced by about 35 cents.

Section 2 argued that the system of equations (.L) should be
estimated by using

=

+ SDt

as an instrumental variable for

Reestimating the basic model using the same correction for

autocorrelatjon as was used in Table 1 and an instrumental variable
estimator yielded the coefficient estimates presented in Table 2.
Comparing the estimates in Tables 1 and 2, fairly sizable

changes in the coefficients on w have occurred. The effect of
a one dollar change in w on MON has dropped from 17 cents to 12
cents and on ri€ from 22 cents to 16 cents.

Neither effect is now

stacistica].ly significant. Since the sum across all equations of

the coefficients on w must equal 1, the fall in the estimated
coefficients in the MON arid TIME equations must be balanced by changes

in other equations. The coefficient on w in the equation for
NONMKT has increased from .31 to .36, but the largest change has
occurred in the equation for LIAB (.17 in Table 1 versus .26 in

Table 2). The estimated coefficient on w in the BOND equation
has doubled, but still has a t ratio less than 1.0.
The coefficients on PDY have also changed considerably as a

result of the change in estimation methods. The estimated interest
rate effects, however, have not changed very much. RCP is no longer
statistically significant in the BOND equation whereas it is in the
MORT equation now; RBOND is no longer significant in the MORT equation.
Since many of the estimated coefficients in Tables 1 and .2 are

small and not statistically significant, a revised version of the

asset demand equations which excludes variables from some of the

equations was estimated. Since the purpose of this paper is to
reestiniate consistently this basic type of financial model that has

been estimated in the past without regard to measurement error, the
OLSQ estimates in Table 1 were used as a guide in respecifying the

model. This revised version was then estimated by OLSQ arid by the
instrumental variable estimator.

In general, a variable was dropped from an equation if the t ratio

for its estimated coefficient in that equation was less than 1. Two
exceptions were made: the own rate (RNORT) was left in the equation
for MaRT, and the expected rate of inflation variable was left in all

the equations. Since the coefficient on the expected rate of
inflation is a combination of the interest rate coefficients if

31.

households' respond to real interest rates, dropping some interest
rate variables in an equation may greatly affect the estimated

coefficient on expected inflation. For this reason it was left
in each equation.

Each equation in its modified version was first estimated

separately using OLSQ. The calculated residuals from the equations
were then analyzed to determine the zero elements of the matrix C

in (3.18). The equations were then transformed according to the
results of the residuals analysis and the six equations were jointly
e3tirnated subject to the cross equation restrictions which result

from the autocorrelation transformation. The resulting estimates
appear in Table 3.

As might be expected, the major changes in going from Table 1 to
Table 3 occur in the coefficients of the lagged stock variables and

the autocorrelation structure of the residuals. The coefficient on

zw has fallen in the equation for NONMKT and risen in the TIfr
equation. Rather than consider further comparisons of Tables 1 and
3, we can examine the effects of reestiniating by instrumental

variables the modified specification of Table 3. The resulting
estimates are contained in Table

while

the estimated coefficients

on w from Tables 1 through Table 14 are brought together for
comparison in Table 5.
The estimates in Table 5

show that the estimated coefficient

on w is most sensitive to the method of estimation in the
modified model in the TI and NONMKT equations. However, even here
the absolute differences are relatively small with the instrumental
variable estimates implying that an additional 7 cents out of every

cents less in

demand deposits and currency. These do not seem like very large

magnitudes. In response to a billion dollar increase in w , the
estimated impact on net acquisition of time deposits and savings
accounts during the quarter of the increase would differ by only .2.°/o

of the average level of total holdings by households and 6°/o of the

average size of net acquisitions. The conclusion to be drawn from
Table 5 then is that while the sizeable statistical discrepancy for

the household sector suggests serious measurement error problems
actual coefficient estimates are not dramatically sensitive to the
estimation method used.

Within the context of the framework developed in section 2, both
of the estimation methods used in this paper would be consistent

Another possible explanation for the results in Table 5 would be
that the measurement errors in

y and y are correlated

(assumption A.8). In this case neither estimation method is

consistent. Without further restricting the model in some way, no
consistent estimator exists since the model is unidentified. The
failure of assumption A.8 to hold does not in itself imply that
similar estimates would be obtained by both estimation methods,

but, given the high correlation between

and y (0.963 over the

sample period 1956:1 to l978:), it is perhaps not surprising.

Summary and Conclusions

Previous studies of sectoral financial behavior which have utilized
data from the Flow of Funds Accounts have ignored the presence of

measurement error. This is potentially a serious problem for the
household sector due to the residual nature of this particular sector

in the Flow of Funds Accounts. If the statistical discrepancy in the
Accounts is interpreted as being the result of measurement error,

previous methods used to estimate Brainard-Tobin type models of the
financial sector can be shown to be inconsistent.

By imposing additional structure on the measurement error, it was
possible to derive a consistent estimator which had the property that,
when all equations contain the same set of explanatory variables,

single equation estimation produces parameter estimates which satisfy
the restrictions implied by the budget identity. Consistency
depended upon the assumption that the measurement error in the

value of financial savings derived as income minus consumption (from

37.

the National Income and Product Accounts) was asymptotically
uncorrelated with the measurement error in financial savings derived

as net acquisition of financial assets minus liabilities (from the
Flow of Funds Accounts).

in order to assess the empirical importance of using a consistent

estimator, a model of the household sector's holdings of five asset
categories and two categories of liabilities was estimated by

two methods. The first involved a straightforward application of
Zeliner's method for estimating seemingly unrelated equations.
The cross equation restrictions implied by the structure of serial
correlation in the errors were imposed in the estimation, but no

adjustments were made for measurement error. This first estimation
method corresponds to the approaches used in previous studies. The
second estimation method is an instrumental variables estimation
method which was shown to be a consistent estimation procedure despite
the measurement errors in the data.

The results for the estimated impact of financial flows on asset

demands, summarized in Table ,

revealed some sizable differences

between the two estimation procedures when the standard Erainard-

Tobin specification was used. In this specification, the same set of
explanatory variables appears in each equation. When

the

equations

were modified, dropping variables that appeared to have zero coefficients,
the differences produced by the two estimation procedures were much
smaller.

This difference in the results obtained in the two versions of the
model may be more an indication of the problem of multicollinearity

38.

common in models of this type than it is a result of the presence

of measurement error. The conclusions to be drawn from the results
reported in section 5 are therefore mixed. It is not clear that
attempting to correct for measurement error will significantly alter

parameter estimates. On the other hand, the estimator develoDed
here is a simple instrumental variables estimator so it would be
easy for researchers working on household financial behavior to

estimate their models using both the standard method and the one

proposed here. If they find little difference in their results, it
can only add to the confidence with which their conclusions can be
held.
