Global shocks, economic growth and financial crises: 120 years of New Zealand experience
Michael D. Bordo, David Hargreaves, and Mizuho Kida
NBER Working Paper No. 16027
May 2010
JEL No. G01
ABSTRACT
We identify the timing of currency, banking crises and sudden stops in New Zealand from 1880 to
2008, and consider the extent to which empirical models can explain New Zealand’s crisis history.
We find that the cross country evidence on the determinants of crises fits New Zealand experience
reasonably well. A number of the risk factors that correlate with crises internationally–such as domestic
imbalances, external debt, and currency mismatches–were elevated for New Zealand when the country
had more frequent crises and have improved in the recent (more stable) period. However, a time-series
analysis of New Zealand growth over 120 years shows that global factors–such as the US growth rate
and terms of trade–explain New Zealand growth fairly well, and that crisis dummy variables do not
have significant additional explanatory power. This suggests that having sound institutions and policies
may help avoid severe domestic crises, but will not be sufficient to avoid the domestic economic impact
of the global business cycle.

Introduction

The shocks that New Zealand has recently faced in an environment of
increasing globalisation of the world economy - integration in both goods
and finance - have resonance to the first era of globalisation in the years
1880-1913. Globalisation has been associated with an increased incidence of
financial crises including banking crises, currency crises, debt crises and
sudden stops.2 Also along with globalisation business cycles have become
increasingly synchronised across countries. They have become connected by
common global shocks which are often financial in nature. In such an
environment, a small open economy can be hit hard by financial crises
leading to recessions. It can also be hit by real shocks that reduce its terms of
trade and the volume of its exports. What factors can prevent global shocks
from being so damaging?
In this paper, we look at the crisis history of the New Zealand economy, and
consider how international cross-country evidence on the determinants of
crises fits that history. This allows us to identify factors that appeared to
increase New Zealand’s susceptibility to certain sorts of crisis at certain
periods, and we are able to use these results to make statements about how
New Zealand’s level of risk may have changed over recent years. We also
see if changing crisis susceptibility has affected our macroeconomic
dependence on the rest of the world.
In section two, we briefly review some of the extant cross-country literature
on the incidence and determinants of various types of financial crises
including banking, currency, debt crises and sudden stops. Based on this
research we can isolate variables that can attenuate the impact of shocks.
These include macro fundamentals like current account balance, low fiscal
deficits, low money growth, low inflation, low debt to GDP ratios, and
openness. They also include institutional variables like pegging to the gold
standard before 1914, having an independent central bank that acts as a
lender of last resort, having a Parliamentary government and especially,
having low ‘original sin’ (foreign currency denominated debt), and low
currency mismatches.
In section three, we look at the crisis history of New Zealand and consider

2

See Bordo et al (2001). Crisis incidence was relatively high during periods of
globalisation, and also in the disruptive period of ‘deglobalisation’ between the two world
wars.

how it fared within the historical context of global financial crises. The New
Zealand economy has been subject to frequent currency crises (from the
1930s until 1984) and sudden stops where unwillingness to invest in New
Zealand forces the current account to rapidly reverse. It also had two
relatively small but significant banking crises. However, overall the
international comparison suggests that New Zealand did quite well in
avoiding serious financial stress (particularly serious banking crises) as did
several other countries like Canada and the Scandinavian countries which
had sound institutions and policies.
In section four, we estimate the cross-country models of currency crisis and
sudden stops reviewed in section two using an augmented dataset which
includes New Zealand. In the existing literature, New Zealand is often not
included in the estimation samples because of missing values in key
variables. Based on the results from the estimation, we highlight factors
which were important in mitigating or exacerbating crisis risk in the country.
We find that in the first era of globalisation (1880-1913) New Zealand was
less exposed to currency crises than the average country through having a
larger trade surplus and more favourable terms of trade shocks, but was more
exposed to sudden stops because of its high ‘original sin’. In the second era
of globalisation (after 1972), New Zealand was more exposed to currency
crises than the average country despite its higher per capita income (which
by itself tends to predict a lower risk of a crisis) because of its weak
fundamentals. Improvements in these fundamentals since the mid 1990s
appear to have reduced the risk of currency crises in New Zealand today
from a decade ago.
In section five, we explore the impact on New Zealand growth of the
financial crises as well as global variables such as major country growth or
the terms of trade. We find that global variables are effective in explaining
smoothed paths for New Zealand growth, with the specification surprisingly
robust over the roughly 120 year period. Once the impact of key global
variables is taken into account the financial crises in New Zealand appear to
have little additional explanatory power for the country’s medium-term
growth paths. This may suggest that financial crises in New Zealand have
mainly been an endogenous response to stress brought on by exogenous
global forces rather than a significant independent source of variation in the
New Zealand growth rate.

Review of cross-country literature on financial crises
and their determinants

2.1

Banking and currency crises and sudden stops from 1880 to 1997

Bordo et al (2001) identified currency crises, banking crises and twin crises
for a panel of 21 countries (both advanced and emerging) from 1880 to 1997
and also for a larger panel of 56 countries from 1973 to 1997. Currency
crises, defined as a market based attack on the exchange value of a currency,
were identified using an ‘exchange market pressure indicator’ defined as a
weighted average of changes in exchange rates, reserves and short-term
interest rates, and alternatively, a survey of expert opinion. Banking crises
defined as bank runs, significant bank failures, suspensions of convertibility
and fiscal resolutions were based on World Bank dates for post 1971 and on
historical narratives for earlier periods. Twin crises were defined as banking
and currency crises in the same or consecutive years.
Other papers in the crisis literature have also looked at sovereign debt crises,
and sudden stops. Because New Zealand has not experienced a sovereign
debt crisis, we do not discuss that literature in this paper. A sudden stop is
defined as an abrupt reduction in net capital inflows (or a relevant proxy),
with some definitions also requiring that the reduction in capital inflow must
be coincident with or precede a decline in real GDP. Sudden stops are fairly
common in New Zealand economic history (see section 3).
Bordo et al (2001) and subsequent papers have developed stylised facts on
crisis incidence including the following:
•

Crises are reasonably frequent and appear to have gradually become
more frequent in recent years, with crisis incidence in the Bordo et al
(2001) dataset averaging around 12 percent of country years in the
dataset since 1973.

•

Typically crisis incidence is higher in emerging economies, with the
period between the two world wars one exception.

•

Crises are correlated with substantial periods of below trend
economic growth that cumulate into significant implied output loss.

There is considerable historical evidence of contagion (or at least bunching
across countries) of financial crises. This may reflect common fundamentals
such as similar current account imbalances or similar balance sheet problems
in the banking system. It also may reflect transmission of shocks between

5

countries via the current and capital accounts. For example, figure 1 shows
the countries affected by crises in the same year from the first openness
period and the sample of countries in Bordo and Meissner (2006a).3

Also see Reinhart and Rogoff (2008) who have extended the data base of financial crises
in Bordo et al (2001) to include many more countries and to include episodes back to 1800
and forward to 2008. The pattern echoes that of figure 1 but shows the recurrence of
banking crises in the 1980s and 1990s and the return of a financial crisis today.

2.2

Determinants of Crises

Bordo and Meissner (2009) outline theoretical reasons to expect foreign
capital flows to increase susceptibility to financial crises and consider
institutional variables that may alter that susceptibility. Where a period of
buoyant capital inflows has coincided with a period of excessive optimism
and sparked rising asset prices and leverage, economies become vulnerable
to shifts in the willingness of creditors to roll over loans and supply further
capital. It is harder for an asset price cycle to develop if capital inflows are
not able to play a part (since the banking system’s ability to expand its
balance sheet to accommodate rising asset prices will be constrained). When
capital inflows become less forthcoming, policy options for the country
depend on factors like whether there is a lender of last resort; deep and liquid
financial markets exist; the quality of private lending has been high;
international borrowing has been in local currency; and the fiscal position is
sound. These factors help generate credibility and confidence and provide
room for the government and central bank to provide liquidity support to the
financial system. If they are not present, the risk that a desire to withdraw
capital becomes disorderly (leading to a sudden stop and potential currency
and banking crises) is more significant.
The denomination of fiscal and private sector debt is often an important
factor in increasing susceptibility to financial crises. The denomination of
fiscal and private sector debt in foreign currency (called ‘original sin’ by
Eichengreen and Hausmann, 1999) makes exchange rate depreciation
expand the scale of debt relative to the domestic economy. Substantial
foreign exchange reserves can mitigate this risk to a degree, but it has been a
relevant part of a number of currency and financial crises (such as the 1990s
Asian crises) and appears likely to afflict some countries today. A more
robust solution is to borrow (directly or effectively after hedging contracts)
in local currency, so that debt does not expand automatically as the currency
falls. However there are relatively few countries that are able to do this to a
significant degree.
Below we outline empirical evidence from a number of studies based on the
Bordo et al (2001) dataset on the determinants of financial crises. The data
provide information on crisis incidents and a wide-range of macroeconomic
and institutional variables for over 40 countries between 1880 and 1997. The
period is divided into four sub-periods: the gold standard era (1880-1913),
the inter-war period (1919-1939), the Bretton Woods era (1945-1971), and
the post-Bretton Woods era (1972-1997). The gold standard era and the post-

7

Bretton Woods era are considered to be the periods of globalisation in both
goods and services, and of frequent financial crises. Consequently, crisis
studies tend to focus on these two periods. In section 4 we will look at how
New Zealand compares to the sample of countries in crisis incidence and
determinants during these two periods.
Determinants of sudden stops
Bordo, Cavallo and Meissner (2009) provide evidence on the determinants
of sudden stops in the first era of globalisation 1880-1913, using a pooled
probit methodology and a sample of 20 emerging countries. Their principal
results are that countries which are more open, have lower levels of original
sin and strong fundamentals (represented by high international reserves to
notes ratios, lower ratios of debt to GDP, lower rates of money growth,
lower current account deficits, and higher per capita GDP) have significantly
lower probabilities of being hit by a sudden stop. They also find that a rise in
the Bank of England’s Bank rate significantly raises the probability of a
sudden stop.
They then test for the growth effects of sudden stops. Their results, based on
a treatment effects growth regression to deal with problems of endogeneity,
are that sudden stops reduce growth by around 4 percent in the year a sudden
stop occurs. Sudden stops that are accompanied by financial crises reduce
growth an additional 3.6 percentage points.
Determinants of currency crises
Bordo and Meissner (2009) and Bordo, Meissner and Stuckler (2009)
provide evidence on the determinants of currency crises using a pooled
regression for 19 countries in the first era of globalisation (1880-1913) and
for 45 countries in the second era of globalisation (1973-1997). For the first
era of globalisation, they find that a large positive change in the current
account to GDP ratio and low levels of reserves to notes are both associated
with high probabilities of a currency crisis. This suggests that currency crises
are driven by current account reversals and sudden stops. Other variables
that lead to currency crises include high levels of original sin and a low
foreign currency debt mismatch. For the second era of globalisation, Bordo
and Meissner (2006) and Bordo, Meissner and Stuckler (2009) find that high
current account deficits increase the probability of a currency crisis, as do
rapid money growth and rising foreign interest rates. They also show that
high original sin, unless offset by a low mismatch, leads to a greater
likelihood of a currency crisis.
Determinants of banking crises
Bordo and Meissner (2006a, 2006b) provide evidence on the determinants of
banking crises using a pooled probit for 30 countries from 1880-1913 and

8

over 40 countries between 1972 and 1997. In the first globalisation era,
countries with weaker fundamentals and financial development tended to be
more crises prone. Typically these countries had moderate original sin.
They also find that the risk of a crisis is offset by a low mismatch, defined as
international reserves less outstanding hard currency debt divided by exports.
For the second era of globalisation, Bordo and Meissner find that original sin
and a high mismatch is associated with a greater chance of a financial crisis
but that countries with higher levels of per capita income can offset this.
Other factors leading to a banking crisis include rapid money growth, high
current account deficits and high foreign interest rates.
The empirical evidence surveyed above suggests that debtor countries with
sound fundamentals and institutions could avoid financial crises. A key
determinant of crises in both eras of globalisation was the exposure to
foreign currency debt. However, this could be mitigated by other
institutional factors. Countries like the British Dominions, Sweden and
Denmark and the US in the first era exhibited low risk despite high ratios of
foreign currency debt to total debt, reflecting their ability to offset their
exposures with high export receipts in foreign currency or by having large
international reserves. It also reflected the fact that they had ‘country trust’
which Caballero, Cowan and Kearns (2006) describe as being associated
with sound institutions, the rule of law and stable political systems.

History of Financial Crises in New Zealand

New Zealand has been exposed through its short history to both financial
crises and real shocks. However, its experience with financial crises has been
relatively benign. New Zealand has not experienced a sovereign debt crisis,
and its two episodes of banking crisis appear relatively mild compared to
some international experience.4 With the exception of a number of currency
crises in the mid twentieth century its mild crisis experience may only have
been surpassed by Canada. In this section, we assemble historical data to
analyse crisis incidence for New Zealand using historical narratives and the
quantitative methodologies from the literature reviewed in section 2.
Table 1 contains a chronology of New Zealand’s financial crisis experience
4

Reinhart and Rogoff (2008) distinguish the “big five” post-war developed country banking
crises and show they were coincident with severe economic downturns in those countries,
much worse than milder banking crises in their dataset including New Zealand’s 1987
crisis.

summarising the crisis dates we use based on the balance of evidence
analysed. The reasoning follows, with further technical and data details
available in the appendix. While the precise start and end dates of each
crisis are no doubt open to debate, we think the dates chosen form a
reasonable basis for the empirical work in the remainder of the paper.

Note: Sudden stops are listed in bold if they were coincident with declining real GDP on an
annual basis. These are described in Bordo et al (2001) as SS1. The other sudden stops are
referred to below as SS2.

Hunt (2009) looks at the New Zealand historical record and identifies two
banking crises (1890-95 and 1987-1990). The first crisis (1890-95) began
with problems in the late 1880s and ended with a government rescue of the
Bank of New Zealand (BNZ) in 1895. The crisis was caused by the collapse
of a land boom in the mid- 1880s. The boom in pastoral land was in turn
triggered by massive government investment in infrastructure in the 1870s
and favourable wool prices. The boom ended as global commodity prices
declined and credit provision tightened, as the decline in export prices
reduced land prices below those capitalized in mortgages and bank credit.

10

This put pressure on the BNZ which had been a key lender. The pressure on
the BNZ and other New Zealand financial institutions was heightened by
global events: a sudden stop prompted by the Bank of England raising the
Bank rate in the late 1880s, the Baring crisis of 1890 in Argentina and
London, and a massive banking panic in Australia in 1893. The deeper
underlying cause for all of these crises was a deepening gold deflation
reflecting a global excess demand for gold in a world on the gold standard.
Deflationary pressure only ended following gold discoveries in Alaska and
South Africa in the 1890s. Fearing the effects on the real economy of
insolvency the BNZ was recapitalized by the government in July 1895. The
cost of the bailout is estimated to be 1.6 percent of GDP. This was very mild
compared to Australia’s crisis which cost well in excess of 10 percent of
GDP.
The second banking crisis (1987 to 1990) also involved the BNZ which at
the time was predominately government owned. The crisis started with a
bank-financed property boom following deregulation of the financial system
in 1984. The bust followed the October 1987 Wall Street and local equity
market crash, which caused a commercial property bust, the failure of
several non bank financial institutions and substantial losses for the BNZ.
The BNZ was recapitalised in 1990 at a cost of approximately 1 percent of
GDP.
We identify currency crises based on an exchange market pressure index
supplemented with historical narrative. New Zealand was adjudged to have
experienced seven currency crises. All of them occurred during pegged
exchange rate regimes. The first three occurred during the Great Depression
of the 1930s. A crisis in 1931, the worst year in the global slump, reflected
pressure on the foreign exchange holdings of the trading banks. It led to a
10% depreciation of the NZ pound relative to sterling (Quigley 1992) and
the temporary imposition of exchange controls. In 1933, still in the face of
contractionary pressure, the NZ pound was devalued by 25 percent against
sterling. Depletion of the banking system’s foreign exchange reserves
prompted another crisis in 1938. This led to the institution of a strict
exchange control and import licensing regime which lasted until the 1980s.
Another series of crises occurred during the Bretton Woods regime after
1944. New Zealand didn’t join the IMF until 1961 and kept both capital and
import controls throughout the regime. Quigley (1992) describes a series of
crises in the 1950s, but these did not lead to exchange rate depreciation or
rising interest rates (instead typically being mitigated via intensified import
controls) so do not meet our definition of a currency crisis.
The fourth crisis followed the collapse in the wool market in 1966. Wool
prices declined by around 20% in each of 1967 and 1968 (Reddell and

11

Sleeman 2008). This caused deterioration in the current account and a
depletion of New Zealand’s reserves. In response the government borrowed
from the IMF, tightened import controls and then, following Britain’s
devaluation of sterling in November, New Zealand devalued its currency by
about 20 percent.
The fifth and sixth crises followed the oil price shock of 1973 which led to a
substantial decline in New Zealand’s terms of trade, a serious recession and
severe pressure on the balance of payments. The NZ dollar was devalued in
1975 and again in 1976. The second oil price shock in 1979 had similar but
less severe effects than the first shock. In response the NZ dollar was
devalued by 5 percent in mid 1979 and the country adopted a crawling peg
which was abandoned in 1982.
The final currency crisis we record was in 1984. The NZ dollar was devalued
by 20 percent following a serious currency crisis during the election
campaign. This was quickly followed by deregulation of the financial sector
and the elimination of exchange and capital controls.
We identify sudden stops using two measures: SS1 considers a country as
having a sudden stop during a given year if there is an annual drop in net
capital inflows of at least two standard deviations below the mean of the year
to year changes for the period, and /or it is the first year of a drop in net
capital inflow that exceeds 3 percent of nominal GDP over a period shorter
than four years, and if there is a drop in real GDP (of any magnitude) during
that year or the following year. In Table 1 we mark SS1s in bold; SS2 is a
broader indicator that does not need to be coincident with declining output.
As can be seen from Table 1, the incidence of several years of sudden stops
in the 1880s preceded the banking crisis of 1890-95. Sudden stops also
occurred at the start and end of World War I and preceded the currency
crises during the Great Depression. In the post-war period they preceded the
currency crises of 1974-75 and 1979 but followed the banking crisis of 1990
possibly reflecting the recession of 1991-92. Sudden stops (SS2) occurred
during the Asian/Russian crisis but did not lead to a crisis in New Zealand.

Analysis of cross-country determinants of financial
crises and implications for New Zealand

Following Bordo and Meissner (2005a, 2005b, and 2007), we examine
determinants of currency crises and sudden stops using their cross-country
dataset but augmented with New Zealand data. In the previous studies, New
Zealand drops out of the estimation sample because of missing values in key
variables.
As in the previous studies based on the Bordo et al (2001) dataset, we focus
on the two periods of globalisation (1880–1913 and 1972–1997) and
estimate the models of currency crises and sudden stops using pooled
regressions with robust standard errors clustered at the country level. A
pooled regression is a common strategy to deal with highly unbalanced panel
datasets like this one. Many of the countries in the sample have limited timeseries observations, so a panel regression would severely limit the number of
countries remaining in the estimation sample.5 A pooled regression involves
pooling observations across country- and time-dimensions such that a unit of
observation becomes a country-year, not a country. To allow for the fact that
same countries are repeatedly observed in the sample, we use robust standard
errors which allow individual country’s errors to be correlated over time.
Table A1 and A2 in the appendix report countries in the estimation sample
and the frequency of crises each had during the two periods of globalisation.
Tables 2–4 report our results which highlight the factors associated with
currency crises and sudden stops for a broad group of countries (including
New Zealand). In each table, column (1) is our benchmark specification with
all of the key explanatory variables. Overall, the findings of the cross
country regressions are similar to those reported in Bordo and Meissner
(2005a, 2005b, and 2007). Many variables are statistically significant,
suggesting that countries’ policies exerted an important influence on the risk
of currency crises and sudden stops.
4.1

The first era of globalisation, 1880-1913

In the first era of globalisation New Zealand had no currency crises but faced
frequent sudden stops. Our cross-country regression results suggest that

5

The New Zealand data we have added has nearly complete time series observations for
both periods of globalisation.

13

countries that had frequent currency crisis in this period often had large trade
deficits, negative terms of trade shocks, and high mismatches (table 2).
Original sin by itself was not significantly related to more currency crises
(column 1 – 3). Countries that had a pegged exchange rate (which would
often have been a commitment to the gold standard) experienced more
currency crises during this period. The latter may reflect the fact that a peg
is more likely to be defended (leading to declining reserves and rising
interest rates, which are used as evidence of a currency crisis) and will be
more subject to speculative attack than a clean float. However, the evidence
that pegs are more crisis prone may be the result of selection bias, as some
countries which had been too weak to remain formally pegged were forced
to float in this era.
Our cross-country regression results also showed that countries that
experienced frequent sudden stops in this period tended to have high original
sin, large trade deficits, and were relatively closed to international trade
(table 3). A higher original sin was an independently significant factor for
sudden stops during this period, unlike for currency crises. The composition
of debt captured by original sin (the share of hard-currency debt in total
debt) seem to matter for sudden stops whether we control for the level effect
(foreign currency debt relative to GDP or total debt relative to GDP, the
latter not shown). Countries with relatively high per capita incomes, which
could be a proxy for a better set of institutions, more developed financial
systems, and/ or better management of debt, tended to have fewer crises.
Drawing implications for New Zealand, figure 2 plots the estimated
probability of a crisis in New Zealand over the first period of globalisation.
Predicted risk for New Zealand was elevated in the late 1880s due to a
combination of a large trade deficit and negative terms of trade shocks.
While terms of trade remained volatile throughout, a turnaround in the trade
balance to a strong surplus in subsequent years contributed to lower
predicted risks for the rest of the period. Figure 3 plots determinants of
predicted risk of a currency crisis in New Zealand vis-à-vis average
predicted risk for the sample. 6 The results suggest that New Zealand
managed to avoid currency crises by maintaining on average a higher trade
surplus and lower debt on average, which offset its relative vulnerability
from having a larger mismatch, a pegged exchange rate, and lower gold
reserves. Overall New Zealand’s average predicted risk was slightly higher
than the average predicted risk for the sample for the period.

6

Average predicted risk in the sample is the estimated probability of currency crises when
all explanatory variables are held at the sample averages.

Note: The figure shows differences in predicted risk of a sudden stop for New Zealand
vis-à-vis the average country in the sample. Each bar represents a marginal contribution
of a significant variable in the model (reported in Table 2, column 1) to the difference in
predicted probabilities between New Zealand and the average country in the sample. The
marginal contribution of each of the variable is calculated by multiplying the estimated
coefficient of the variable to the difference in the average values of the variable for this

period between New Zealand and the average country in the sample. For example, New
Zealand had a higher mismatch than the average country for the period, which the model
estimates (other things being equal) would have added 0.8 percentage points to the
predicted risk vis-à-vis the baseline (average country’s) probability.

Figure 4 and 5 repeat the exercise for sudden stops in 1880-1913, a period in
which New Zealand had three sudden stops. Shaded regions in Figure 4
represent the actual years of crises. The model seems to predict well the
periods of relative vulnerability of New Zealand to a sudden stop. Predicted
risk for New Zealand tended to be higher in years preceding the actual years
of crises. Figure 5 suggests that New Zealand’s relative vulnerability to
sudden stops in this period could be related to its higher level of original sin
and to a lesser extent lower gold reserves than average. These effects offset
vulnerability reductions from New Zealand’s trade surpluses and relatively
high openness. Overall, the predicted risk for New Zealand of a sudden stop
was 1 percentage points higher than the average predicted risk for the
sample.

The second era of globalisation, 1972-1997

In the second era of globalisation, New Zealand had more frequent currency
crises but fewer sudden stops – the opposite of what it experienced in the
first era of globalisation (table 1 and table A2). The cross-country results
show that countries that had frequent currency crises in this period tended to
have high original sin with mismatch, high overall levels of debt, high
interest rates, a pegged exchange rate, and low international reserves (table
4).

Countries with relatively low per capita income (a proxy for’weak
institutions’) also suffered more crises.7
Figure 6 and 7 show predicted risk of a currency crisis in New Zealand
relative to average for 1972-1997. Figure 6 shows that predicted risk for
New Zealand was higher than for the average country in the sample
throughout the period but especially between the mid 1970s and the mid
1980s when the country actually suffered frequent currency crises. Figure 7
suggests that New Zealand’s vulnerability to currency crises over the period
is related to its weak fundamentals in most relevant areas other than per
capita income. It had higher original sin, higher debt relative to output,
higher interest rates, and lower international reserves. The net predicted risk
was nearly 9 percentage points higher than the average in the sample,
although there were other countries in the sample (predominately developing
countries) that suffered more crises and had higher predicted risk.

Out-of-sample predictions for New Zealand, 1998-2008

To understand how risk facing New Zealand has changed since the end of
the sample, Figure 8 examines the out-of-sample predictions for New
Zealand’s probability of currency crises for 1998-2008. 8 This exercise
suggests New Zealand faces much lower risk of a currency crisis today due

8

To produce the out-of-sample predictions, we used the within-sample estimates of
marginal effects from the currency crises regression for 1972-1997 (table 4, column (1)),
and applied the out-of-sample values for key policy variables in New Zealand (eg
mismatch, long term interest rates, etc). The out-of-sample GDP per capita for New
Zealand is scaled by the average of the out-of-sample GDP per capita for other countries
in the sample to avoid the obvious bias that would result otherwise. Information on out-ofsample GDP per capita for other countries was obtained from the World Bank’s WDI
database.

22

to improvements since the mid 1990s in many areas of policy weaknesses
identified in the previous period. Declining original sin, mismatch, overall
level of debt, long term interest rates and the floating of the NZD are
estimated to have had a particularly significant impact in reducing the risk of
currency crises based on our cross country model.
It is important to note that declining inflation and long-term interest rates
have been features of the last decade for many other countries, and there
have been relatively few currency crises. New Zealand risk has declined
relative to the average country in the 1972-1997 dataset, but may not have
declined as much relative to the average country today. A second important
caveat is that new sources of risk of currency crisis have arisen that are not
features of our dataset and model. For example, private sector debt has
become an increasingly important risk factor for national balance sheets. We
believe that cross-country analysis of more recent period exploring new
sources of risk for currency crises and sudden stops would be an interesting
piece of future work.
In sum, New Zealand was less exposed than the other countries in the sample
to the risks of currency crises in the first era of globalisation because of its
better fundamentals, but was more exposed to sudden stops because of its
relatively high level of original sin. In the second era, New Zealand was
more exposed than the other countries in the sample to the risk of currency
crises despite its relatively high income per capita (a proxy for ‘sound
institutions’) because of weaknesses in fundamentals such as substantial
government debt. Since then, improvements in fundamentals have reduced
the risks of currency crises facing New Zealand, according to our model, but
it is important to note that new sources of risks that our model does not
capture have arisen in the recent international financial crisis.

Global shocks, financial crises and the New
Zealand economy

In this section, we explore the impact of financial crises on New Zealand
growth and compare it to the impact of global influences such as major
country growth or the terms of trade. New Zealand’s small size means we
can use trading partner growth and world price variables to explain New
Zealand growth without worrying about causality issues: if New Zealand
macroeconomic variables are correlated with global macroeconomic
variables, it must be the global variables driving New Zealand growth rather
than the other way around.9 Because we are dealing with a 120 year dataset
spanning multiple exchange rate regimes and many technological shifts we
naturally do not expect the precise lags between variables to have been
stable. For this reason, and also to eliminate noise, we use a smoothed
growth rate (the three year change in the three year moving average) for the
dependent variable (NZ growth) and most of the explanatory variables. We

9

This has frequently been exploited in empirical work (see e.g. Buckle et al 2002) looking
at higher frequency data for the post-reform period.

24

refer to this transformation below as a smoothed growth rate or simply
growth.
The global macroeconomic variables we consider are the US growth rate,
terms of trade, and UK consol rate. We include the US growth rate as an
indicator of global economic activity. We also tried UK growth as well as (or
instead of) US growth in unreported specifications, but this did not fit well.
While the direct trade links between New Zealand and the UK were more
important than New Zealand/US trade until the mid 1970s, the US was
already a key driver of the global business cycle in the interwar period, and
this may be why US growth fits better (figure 9). As discussed below, we
use UK real interest and a UK/NZ real exchange rate in the regression. We
use these UK variables partly because of data availability, but also because
of the strong direct trade links, and the fact that the UK was the key overseas
capital market for New Zealand firms for much of the period under
examination. New Zealand’s terms of trade is also expected to be an
important independent driver of domestic activity (with commodity booms
boosting farm incomes for example) and does indeed add a lot of
explanatory power to the regression.

Before adding crisis variables, we experimented with simple regressions of
NZ growth on domestic policy variables. We were unable to find a stable
relationship between NZ growth and domestic real interest rates over the
period. This may reflect the multiplicity of monetary policy regimes, which
limits the ability of the simple model to identify monetary policy shocks (eg
endogenous monetary tightenings may be coincident with strong economic
growth). The relationship between NZ growth and the real exchange rate (of
the NZD against sterling) was more stable. The NZD gradually depreciated
against sterling until around the 1930s while measured UK inflation
generally outpaced NZ’s through the period, so that the real exchange rate
gradually fell (figure 10). The fluctuations in the smoothed real exchange
rate were well correlated with the smoothed terms of trade growth rate
(figure 11).

Table 5, column 1 shows our benchmark regression in which NZ growth is
explained by the smoothed growth rates of the terms of trade, the real
exchange rate and US growth To account for serial correlation in the
residuals induced by the three year growth rate we added an AR(2) process
for the residuals.
As can be seen, real US output, the terms of trade and the real exchange rate
are statistically significant and have expected signs. The UK real interest rate
was not significant but is correctly signed. The adjusted R2 of .85 suggests
that these variables do reasonably well in explaining New Zealand growth
although removing the AR (2) terms reduces the adjusted R2 to close to
50%.

growth rates (the three year change in the three year moving average). Capital inflow is a 2
year change in the 2 year moving average ratio to GDP. T-statistics in parentheses.
Significant coefficients (at 5% or better) are shown in bold.

We then introduced our different measures of NZ crisis dates into the
regression. We tried specifications (not reported) that included the
indicators of currency crises or sudden stops from table 1 above, but they
were not statistically significant and were often incorrectly signed. This
differs from the results in cross-country analysis like Bordo, Cavallo and
Meissner (2007) where sudden stops have a discernable impact on growth.
This may be because we have a number of variables in the regression (such
as the terms of trade and world interest rates) which are likely to be
correlated with sudden stops (indeed Bordo, Cavallo and Meissner use them

29

as explanators of sudden stops in an earlier regression).
In specification (2), we use a measure of capital inflows 10 rather than a
binary sudden stop indicator, and this is correctly signed and marginally
significant. Also in specification (2), the two periods of banking crisis have
a negative impact on growth, although the coefficient is not precisely
estimated or significant. The coefficient is consistent with a four year
banking crisis reducing output by about 2.5 percentage points in total.
Figure 12 illustrates the impact of all the regressors in the benchmark
regression (the black line) compared to the actual variable (blue line). The
impacts of the key driving variables are represented additively by the stacked
bars. To make the influences of the driving variables clearer the
autocorrelation in the residuals is not included in the fitted values. US
growth and the terms of trade explain much of the variation in real growth
across many of the growth cycles. The real exchange rate often partly
offsets the terms of trade effect (so the exchange rate is acting as a buffer).
Fit is generally good, however the regression struggles to explain the
weakness of New Zealand’s economic performance in the second half of the
1920s (a period noted as difficult to explain by other writers).11 It is also
unable to explain the strength of the economic recovery after the depression,
which may partly relate to the imposition of import controls in 1938 and the
subsequent shift to wartime production. The banking crisis variable helps
explain weak periods of growth around the two banking crises. The impact
of the capital flow variable is relatively minor.

10

Capital flows are proxied by the inverse of the trade balance (ie M minus X) plus change
in reserves. This ignores invisible components of the current account like investment
income, but investment income is unlikely to drive the cycle in capital flows. The variable
used in the regression is the two year change in the two year moving average of the capital
inflow to output ratio. This is mainly to reduce the impact of year to year noise.

11

Easton (2007) suggests further analysis of the interwar period and the 1920s in particular
is necessary. International currency misalignment and the NZ link to Sterling (which was
back on gold at an overvalued exchange rate by 1924) may have played a part. The boom
in the US may have been making it difficult to attract capital to New Zealand.

While we preferred to work with smoothed variables for the reasons
discussed above, the smoothing can be interpreted as a particular set of
parameter restrictions on a simple annual growth regression. To test the
robustness of our results to this, we ran some regressions using simple
annual growth rates. This naturally did not fit as well (see table A3) but
continued to imply the international driving variables (particularly the terms
of trade in this specification) explained New Zealand growth better than the
crisis variables. This was also true in pre and post WWII sub-samples.
The limited explanatory power of ‘crises’ over and above international
variables is an interesting result. It may reflect the relatively mild nature of
many of the ‘crises’ in New Zealand history (for example, the fact that the
two banking crises largely involved a single leading bank rather than the
entire banking system and never provoked a widespread collapse in banking
confidence). It may also suggest that financial crises in New Zealand are
mainly an endogenous response to stress brought on by exogenous global
forces rather than a significant independent source of variation in the New
Zealand growth rate. It is hard to test this hypothesis for many countries
since there is significant two way causality between domestic and
international variables, but as discussed above we are able to plausibly treat
international variables as exogenous to New Zealand developments.
We next tested whether there was evidence of instability over time in the
coefficients of global growth and the terms of trade, using recursive
regressions and estimating a simplified version of the benchmark regression
with a Kalman filter. The time varying parameters on the terms of trade, US
growth and the real exchange rate are shown in figure 13. It appears that the
responsiveness of New Zealand growth to these variables may have fallen
gradually after 1938. This could reflect both the extensive economic controls
imposed between 1938 and 1984 (the period shaded in blue) and the use of
floating exchange rates as an economic buffer post 1984. It is difficult to see
much of a difference in the coefficients of the three variables between the
1938-84 period and the subsequent float.

The value of the real exchange rate as a buffer against terms of trade
fluctuations is apparent in figure 11. One interesting question is the extent to
which the responsiveness of the real exchange rate to the terms of trade may
have increased since the 1985 float. A simple regression over 1885-2008 of
the smoothed real exchange rate change on the smoothed terms of trade
change (with a third lag to allow for the potential for the real exchange rate
to respond more slowly in fixed rate regimes) suggests that the real exchange
rate responded to the terms of trade in both samples. However, there was
less response and some evidence of a lag in the insulationist period (193884) and the full sample, while in the post float period the response was
stronger and not lagged. This suggests that the real exchange rate may have
buffered terms of trade fluctations somewhat more effectively since the float.

Conclusions and Lessons for Policy

Financial crises have occurred across most countries and across different
exchange rate regimes. Cross country empirical literature studying periods
of strong globalisation suggests that countries have some hope of avoiding
financial crises by following sound policies and adopting sound institutions,
and our analysis of New Zealand appears consistent with this. In the first era
of globalisation New Zealand was less exposed to a currency crisis than the
average country. For the second era of globalisation, however, New Zealand
was more exposed to a currency crisis than the average country because of
its weak fundamentals. Our out-of-sample prediction for New Zealand
suggests that improvements in many of the policy areas (mismatch, debt to
GDP, international reserves, etc.) in the more recent period meant that New
Zealand faces much lower risk of a currency crisis today than a decade ago.
However, the global business cycle can still exert powerful effects on small
open economies like New Zealand even if they follow basically sound

34

policies and avoid serious financial crises. Our time series analyses suggests
that shocks to US real GDP (as a proxy for global output) and shocks to the
terms of trade have significant impact on New Zealand’s medium-term
growth. Domestic crisis-dummy variables add little explanatory power to
the regressions of its growth rate over and above the impact of the
international factors. The relationship between NZ growth and the
international factors has remained broadly stable over the 120 year period we
study, although we find some evidence that the real exchange rate has been a
faster ‘shock absorber’ in response to terms of trade fluctuations since the
float in 1985.

Data Sources

General notes: Our data for cross country analyses in section four
comes from Bordo and Meissner (2006b) and Bordo and Meissner (2009).
We appended New Zealand data to their dataset using the Statistics New
Zealand (SNZ)’s long-term data series. This includes inflation, government
debt and revenue, trade and GDP data, and the terms of trade. To cover more
recent years, the long term data series are spliced to modern sources from the
Reserve Bank database. Where key variables were missing for NZ we filled
them according to the description below.
Reserves: The Bordo and Meissner mismatch measure is (Government
external debt – reserves / exports). We do not have data for NZ reserves in
the early period (1880-1913)and therefore use estimated values. Specifically,
we assumed that NZ maintained the same level of import cover (a ratio of
reserves to import) as Australia for the period and multiplied Australia’s
import cover by NZ’s imports to get NZ’s reserves. For the most recent
period, we use the IFS measure of NZ external debt (line 89a) and of
Reserves (line 1l). IFS external debt figures are discontinued around 2001
and we switch to the external debt figures from the SNZ Overseas debt
survey.
Exchange rate: The NZD/Sterling real exchange rate is calculated
using historical UK CPI data from O’Donaghue (2004) and a nominal
exchange rate series from Briggs (2003).
Capital flows: New Zealand capital inflows are estimated using the
identity that the current account plus change in reserves is equal to the
capital account. The trade balance is used as a proxy for the variability in
the current account (debt service being likely to be less cyclical). Reserves
data are only available after 1948 (using IFS line 1l) and the change in
reserves is assumed to be zero prior to that.
An Exchange Market Pressure indicator is constructed along the lines
of Eichengreen, Rose and Wyplosz (1994) to identify currency crises using
changes in the exchange rate, interest rates, and reserves. However, the
historical use of capital controls and the lack of reserves data prior to 1948
reduce the reliability of this indicator. The currency crises we identify in
historical narrative tend to be coincident with actual depreciation in the
exchange rate.
