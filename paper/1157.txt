Financial Innovation and the Control of Monetary Aggregates:
Some Evidence from Canada
ABSTRACT
This paper presents an empirical test of the proposition that
control of a monetary aggregate will generate a rise in its velocity.
The test is carried out utilizing the Canadian experience of controlling

Ml growth from 1975:3 to 1982:3. Section One of the paper presents
evidence of the instability of the Canadian demand from Ml money since

1975:3. Section Two develops a specific form of the proposition which
emphasizes the role of asset substitution between classes of chartered

bank deposits. A relative asset demand equation is derived from a

wealth

maximization model subject to a technological transactions

constraint and this equation is

estimated from 1961 through 1982.

The results lend support to the proposition that central bank control
of Ml generated a rise in Ml velocity.

Introduction

Over the past nine years there has been extensive documentation of instabil—

ity in the U.S. Ml demand for money function. Since this instability implies
less predictability between money and nominal flCoflE, it raises serious doubts

about the ability of the monetary authorities to control nominal income through
a policy of targeting the growth rates of monetary aggregates.
The evidence on the instability of the money demand function has been reviewed recently by Judd and Scadding [1982] and they note that it has spawned

two distinct research agendas. First, it is argued that financial innovation
has changed the meaning of the monetary aggregates which the authorities are

attempting to control. The solutions implied by this argument are either
to redefine the aggregates to include the new instruments which are substituting
for Ml money in the payments mechanism, as the Federal Reserve has done recently, or to attempt to model the process of innovation thereby restoring predictability to the relationship between money and nominal income.

The second line of research has followed the suggestion that the perceived
stability of the demand for money prior to 1973 was in fact a misconception.
The reality, it is maintained, was that a number of issues regarding the appropriate specification of money demand were swept under the rug because the data

could not generate a resolution of them.' Consequently the pre—1973 debate has
been reopened in the hope of generating a more robust specification of the
demand for money.

In this paper I focus on the first approach and attempt to shed some light

on the process of innovation utilizing Canadian data. The basic framework is
that of Silber [1975, 1982] who suggests that innovation results from the at—

—2—

tempt of banks to circumvent constraints imposed upon the banking industry or

its customers. These constraints can arise either through centralized policy of

the government or through the normal functioning of markets. Regardless of the
source, however, this framework suggests that if changing conditions increase
the shadow price of adhering to a constraint firms will have an incentive to
undertake or intensify the search for new financial instruments.
One application of this constraint—induced innovation hypothesis has been
carried out by Simpson and Porter [1980] who concentrate on the effects of high

interest rates on the interest elasticity of Ml demand. Given higher oppor-

tunity

to

costs of holding money, individuals will impute a higher rate of return

investment in new techniques of money management. In addition, the restric-

tion on the payment of interest on demand deposits will induce banks to innovate

in this area. This twofold effect, it is alleged, results in new instruments
such as lock boxes or ATS accounts which lower the demand for Ml.

Furthermore,

should interest rates subsequently decline the process will not reverse itself
because the resource costs of the new techniques and instruments have been in-

curred. Simpson and Porter attempt to capture this effect through an interest
rate ratchet variable which allows for a lag between peaks in interest rates and

subsequent innovations. Their results, however, do not suggest that this technique is sufficient to restore confidence in the Ml function.
A more fundamental interpretation of circumventive innovation is suggested
by the Kaldor hypothesis [1970] that an attempt by the authorities to control

the

growth rate of a monetary aggregate will result in a rise in the velocity of

that money

as private agents substitute to another payments mechanism.2

-

—3—

The choice of interpretation is of more than passing interest because of the
profoundly different policy implications. The former suggests either a respeci—
fication of Ml demand or the choice of a broader aggregate to internalize any

substitution which might occur. While it is recognized that during a period of
rapid innovation it may be difficult to achieve desired stability and predictability

in the money demand function, the basic thrust of this interpretation

does not appear to undermine the case for control of a particular monetary

aggregate. The latter interpretation, in contrast, does appear to question
the basic policy. Bluntly put, any single—minded pursuit of a particular mone-

tary target is destined to fail because private agents will innovate to escape
the cutting edge of the control.
An attempt to provide empirical evidence for or against the latter hypothesis is hampered by the fact that the experience of the Federal Reserve with
targeting on monetary growth rates has coincided with an environment of high
market rates of interest and restrictions on the payment of interest on depo-

sits. As argued above, this combination could be the trigger for innovation.
In addition, the move to deregulation has spawned new instruments such as the
NOW account and the new money market account; innovations which a priori should

lead to a reduction in Ml demand. As a result, it does not appear possible to
separate the effect, if any, of the Kaldor hypothesis from the forces mentioned
above.

The Canadian experience with controlling monetary aggregates appears to be
appropriate for an empirical test of the Kaldor hypothesis for the following

reasons. First, the stated policy of the Bank of Canada from the fourth quarter

—4—

of

1975 until the fourth quarter of 1982 was a gradual reduction in the rate of

growth

of

Ml and, of equal importance, this policy was effected to a consider-

able degree.3 Second, during this period there was no restriction on the payment of interest on deposits nor was there any

substantial

change in the

regulatory environment facing the banking industry. Third, over the period in
question there has been substantial financial innovation and, unlike the U.S.

experience, this has occurred within the chartered banking system. Finally,
during this same period there has been a significant rise in Ml velocity after
accounting for both trend and the rapid rise in interest rates.
Indeed, for the above reasons one could argue that the Canadian environment

of

l97'5 through 1982 will closely resemble that of the United States in the

decade ahead

and should therefore be able to provide clues as to what difficul-

ties await the Federal Reserve.5
In what follows, Section I discusses the nature of financial innovation in
Canada and presents some evidence relating to the instability of the money demand

function. Section II models the Kaldor hypothesis in the context of circumven—
tive innovation and presents a test of the hypothesis. Section III summarizes
the main conclusions of the paper.

Section I

A. Financial Innovation in Canada6
The financial innovations of the past eight years which have influenced the

demand for Ml have occurred both in the corporate and household sectors. In
the former category, the first major innovations occurred in the mid—seventies

—5—

and they took the form of new cash management techniques which allowed corpora-

tions to minimize daily working balances. One

of

the more important of these

is the centralized concentration account which allows for consolidation of

several, perhaps geographically dispersed, accounts. A report is issued to the
corporate treasurer the morning following deposits and he may allocate these

funds as he sees

fit.

In addition, this period witnessed the introduction of

regional lock boxes and preauthorized account withdrawals which reinforced the

tendency

In

to accept standing orders on how to
of the options offered are interest—bearing

the past tio years, banks began

employ surplus funds overnight. Two

notice deposits (which are not included in the definition of Ml) or the auto-

matic paydown of outstanding demand loans. Either of these options would tend
to reduce the demand for Ml balances.
On the household side, the major innovations have been the introduction of
daily interest savings accounts and daily interest chequable savings accounts.
Prior to the third quarter of 1979, chartered banks calculated interest on

savings accounts based on the minimum monthly balance. Consequently, funds
received during the month such as salary payments were deposited typically in

personal chequing accounts. With the advent of daily interest accounts in
August and September, 1979, individuals would have a much greater incentive to
economize on demand deposits within the month.

The second innovation occurred in the latter half of 1981 with the introduc-

tion of daily interest chequable savings accounts. Prior to this change savings

accounts could not as a rule be used for transactions purposes. The new

—6—

accounts are actually hybrids of saving and demand in that interest is paid
above a minimum balance and withdrawals, while subject to a fee, are not

restricted. Since this is technically a notice deposit, it is not included in
the definition of Ml and the spread of this account would tend to reduce Ml

balances.7
The combined effect of these innovations has had a significant effect on
the Ml demand function and the next section presents some evidence of this
effect.

B. Stability of the Demand for Money
Landy [1980] presents some evidence on the stability of the Canadian Ml

demand function since 1915. Utilizing the technique of out—of—sample dynamic
forecasting, she identifies a break (downshift) about the second quarter of

1976. Hem [19801 has noted that dynamic forecasting tends to exaggerate the
duration of any shift since it captures the lags in adjustment of money to the

level of demand. He argues that static forecasts will present a more accurate picture of any shift in the demand function. Consequently, it seems
new

appropriate to reconsider the evidence.

dummy variables to control for the effect of the

interruption of the payments mechanism due to postal
strikes.

The addition of dumnr variables is necessitated by the apparent

willingness of the Bank of Canada to accommodate the teorary increase in
demand for liquidity which occurs during a postal strike. A strike tends to
delay households' payments to firms but it does not interrupt some of

firms' financial obligations such as payrolls. Consequently, an uncorrected
money demand function will tend to underestimate money at the time of a
strike.

Gregory and MacKinnon [19801 argue that the partial adjustment model
which underlies equation (1) requires the addition of a lagged dunury whenever

a dummy is included. The coefficient of the lagged dummy mist be constrained
to equal the negative of the product of the coefficient of the lagged dependent variable and the contemporaneous duinny. This procedure was followed in
the estimation of equation Ci).
Since the nature and duration of postal strikes has differed signifi—
cant],y, separate dummies were added for each strike. The coefficients for
the strikes of 1965:3, 1968:3, 1970:2, 1915:1, 1980:3 and 1981:3 are insignificant are the ten percent level and are not included in the final
regression. The coefficients for the strikes of 19714:2 and 1975:4 are signi—

—8—

ficant at the five percent level and are essentially identical. In the final

regression they are constrained to be equal. The coefficient for the strike

of l978:4 is significant at the ten percent level.9
Table 1 presents estimates of equation Ci)

for

the 1956:1 — 1976:1 and the

1956:1 — 1982:3 saiile periods. The choice of sample period follows that of
Landy. While the differences between the samples are not as pronounced as that
for the U.S. equation, the general pattern is maintained. The coefficient on

the lagged dependent variable rises from 0.736 to 0.900. This implies that the
mean adjustment lag increases from 3.8 to 10 quarters which suggests an

implausible lag. The impact elasticity for real income is halved and the long—
run interest elasticity rises from 0.20 to 0.55. The standard error of the
equation also increases by 25 percent.

A standard F test for structural stability allows one to reject the hypothe-

sis of stable coefficients across the hypothesized break point of 1976:1. The
calculated F statistic of 5.09 exceeds the one percent critical value of 3.51.
Further evidence of the instability of the function is demonstrated by an

analysis of the equation's forecasting ability. Post—sample static forecasts of
equation (i), based on the coefficient estimates from the 1956:1 — 1976:1

regression, are presented in Table 2. In every quarter the equation over—

predicts Ml demand. The root mean square error is more than three times the
standard error of the in—sample equation and
bias (one—sided prediction) is 58%.

While

the

above evidence would tend to support a claim that the demand for

has altered over the past seven years, it does not provide any clues
as to the nature of the breakdown. If the function simply experienced a onemoney

time

change in intercept without a change in slope coefficients, then one could

still retain confidence in the underlying economic relationships. However, if
the instability were due to the omission of variables or to fundamental changes
in relationships, then the implications for control of monetary aggregates are
much more serious.
In order to gain a better understanding of the nature of the instability one

can utilize the Breusch and Pa,n [1979] test for random coefficient variation.
The test statistic is one half the R2 times the sample size of a regression
of the squared residuals from equation (1) on the squared values of the
explanatory variables.

10

2

This statistic is x with degrees of freedom equal

to the number of explanatory variables. The calculated statistic of 13.82

exceeds the one percent critical value of 1l.3L Therefore, we can reject
the null hypothesis of zero coefficient variation over this period.
Since the post 1976:1 sample has been characterized by substantially higher
interest rates on average, a log—linear form which constrains the interest elasticity to be constant might be expected to perform more poorly than a semilog

form. Equation (i) was reestimated using the natural value rather than the log
of the interest rate and was subjected to the same tests as outlined above.
The F test statistic of 4.22 supports a rejection of the null hypothesis of

structural

stability at the one percent level. The out—of—sample predictions

show less bias than those of equation 1

but there is a tendency to overpredict

—12—

from 1976:2 to 1980:3 (sixteen out of eighteen quarters) and underpredict after

1980:3 (six out of eight quarters). In addition the Breusch and Pagan test
statistic of 14.42 supports a rejection of the hypothesis of zero coefficient

variation again at the one percent level. We conclude that the money demand
function cannot be rehabilitated simply by a change in functional form.

Since the hypothesis under investigation deals with the velocity of Ml, we

have investigated this variable directly. Table 3 presents the results of a
regression of the log of Ml velocity on a constant term, the log of the three—
month treasury bill rate, and time for four subperiods between 1954 and 1982.
The niest striking feature of the results is that the estimated quarterly growth

rate in Ml velocity averages 0.47 percent from 1954:4 to 1975:3 and 1.1 percent

since the advent of targeting of Ml in 1975:3. Also, the interest rate variable
for the last period is not significant. The F test statistic supports a rejection of the hypothesis of structural stability about 1975:3 at the one percent
level of significance.

In anticipation of the discussion of Section II, Table 4

presents

the re—

suits of an analysis of the velocities of currency, demand deposits and time

deposits. This data demonstrates that the rapid acceleration in Ml velocity
over the past seven years can be attributed primarily to the increase in demand

deposit velocity. This result together with the fact that the time deposit velocity growth rate increases in absolute value by 150 percent over this same period
indicates that significant deposit substitution has occurred since the targeting of
Ml began.

Section II

The maintained hypothesis under investigation is that the rise in Ml velocity above trend over the past eight years is a result of the attempt by private
agents to circumvent Bank of Canada policy of a gradual reduction in Ml growth.

The rationalization for this attempt at circumvention is straightforward. An
announced policy of a reduction in the growth rate of a particular monetary
aggregate should generate a reduction in expectations of future inflation,
assuming that these expectations are formed in a rational manner, and sub-

sequently, to a decline in nominal interest rates. If, however, the stance of
fiscal policy in inconsistent with this announced policy (as it was in Canada
over the period in question) then rational individuals may find the monetary
policy lacking in credibility and they may not revise their expectations of
inflation.11 As a. result, the ensuing reduction in liquidity will raise
interest rates.

As individuals perceive higher opportunity costs of holding money balances they may attempt to substitute towards interest—bearing deposits.
Substitution will be constrained by the fact that interest—bearing deposits
are a less efficient payments mechanism than Ml money and individuals may
look outside the banking system for alternatives.

Chartered banks have two options open to them to prevent competitors

from attracting their deposits. They can pay interest on checking accounts
or they can enhance the efficiency of other types of deposits as mediums of

exchange through innovation. The tradeoff banks face in choosing between
these alternatives is the eight percent differential in reserve requirements

—15-.

between

demand and time deposits and the cost of innovation. Presumably some

combination

of the two options will be optimal which suggests that innova-

tions 'will generate greater substitution from Ml to time deposits than in

previous periods.
The above argwnent suggests that the rise in Ml velocity is linked

directly to deposit substitution. It follows, therefore, that to test the
proposition that Ml velocity is a function of the degree of control of Ml one
requires a model of the decision process by which private agents determine
the relative holdings of various monies.
Following Chetty [1969] and Moroney and Wilbratte [1976]

we assume that

,

households maximize financial wealth subject to a monetary transaction
constraint.-2 Formally, define financial 'wealth in period t as

M(t) +

w(t)
where M(t)

and

X1(t)[l+r.(t)],

(2)

nominal Ml money balances;

x.(t)

nominal holdings of the 1th class of interest—bearing assets;

r.(t)

nominal interest rate of the i

asset.

We assume the technolor by which households combine money and interest—
bearing financial assets is given by equation (3).

T3(t) =

I8(t)M(t)

(3)

volume of transactions services undertaken in period t;

technical coefficients on money and interest—bearing assets

respectively;

and

substitution parameters of money and interest—bearing assets

respectively.

As Moroney and Wilbratte note, the above formulation assumes that the decisions affecting the relative portfolio holdings of money and assets X1 are inde—
pendent of the yields on physical and human capital; an assumption which

Bisignani [19151 tests and accepts using U.S. data. If, in addition, we assume

that p =

p=p

for all i and j (an assumption which Moroney and Wilbratte

could not reject) then we can approximate equation (3) by its CES form.

Maximizing equation (2) subject to the CES form of equation (3) yields the
following first—order condition.

(1)

m1(t)

where m(t) the optimal ratio of Ml to X;
the relative technolor coefficient of the th asset;
E

and g(t)

i/(1±),

the elasticity of substitution between Ml and

1/(1+r1(t)).

Finally, we note that there is no reason to assume that

remains constant

over time especially given our knowledge of the trend rate of increase in Ml

velocity. As a working hypothesis we assume that

is a function of per-

manent income as specified in equation (5).

t) = 0Y1(t),
where Y(t)

permanent income

and

the difference between the coefficients on

respectively.

The justification for equation (5) is twofold. First, the inventory approach
to modelling money demand suggests that there are economies of scale asso-

ciated with the level of income. We assume that these scale economies may be
approximated by a rise in

which is the relative technolor coefficient of

the th asset. Second, permanent income is a trend—demoninated variable and
as such it may be expected to capture the effects over time of changes in the
transactions demand for Ml money which are unrelated to the control of Ml.

We can utilize equation (6) to test directly whether banks pursued a policy

of deposit substitution as a result of central bank control of Ml. If the
hypothesis is correct, some form of structural instability of equation (6)
should appear about the breakpoint of 1975:14 and with the addition of a suitable

proxy variable we should be able to model this instability.
Defining M3—Ml as the interest—bearing asset and the chartered bank
three—month deposit rate as the relevant interest rate, we estimated equation

—18—

(6) using quarterly data from 1961:1 to 1982:3. Y(t) and g(t) were estimated
in distributed lag form since the estimation results of equation (i) suggests
a mean lag in adjustment of actual to desired money balances of close to four

quarters prior to 1915:3. The lags were estimated with a second degree poly—
nomial. We imposed an endpoint restriction of zero for the seventh and
fourth lags for Y(t) and g(t) respectively.
The initial estimate by ordinary least squares yielded a D.W. statistic
which indicated positive autocorrelated disturbances and hence a specification

error. Two possible sources of error are the assumption that the transactions

technolor is of a CES type and that the portfolio relationship between Ml money
and time deposits of chartered banks is independent of the yield on physical or
human capital.

Utilizing equation (3) which implies a more general techno1or, we derived
an equation corresponding to equation (6) and estimated it over the same sample

period with M2—M1 and M3-Ml as the relevant alternative assets. Again, the D.W.
statistic indicated positive autocorrelation and the correlation correction
yielded estimates of rho which were not significantly different from that of

equation (6). Therefore we conclude that the assumption of a CES technolor is
not a source of error in equation (6).
If the assets in the transactions constraint are not separable from physical
or human capital, then the m.(t) which we estimated would not be invariant to

changes in the

yields

on these assets. In order to test for this type of rela—

tionship, we included an inflationary expectations proxy in equation (6). The
proxy variable is that of Riddell and Smith [19821 who generate forecasts from

—19—

an ARIMA model estimated from a moving sample of 38)4

monthly observations

beginning in 1921. The method of moving sample insures that agents form expectations on previous experience only rather than on the basis of experience

over the entire sanle.13 Again the estimation yielded an estimate of rho not
significantly different from that of equation (6). We conclude that, to the
extent that our proxy accurately measures inflationary expectations, the
assumption of separability of physical capital from financial assets in the

transactions technolor is not the cause of the specification error.
Accordingly, equation (6) was reestimated using the Cochrane—Orcutt

method of correction for autocorrelation. Prior to the presentation of the
regression results let us review the a priori restrictions on the coef-

ficients. First, since the sum of the c coefficients is the elasticity of
substitution between Ml and time deposits, it should be positive. Second,
given our knowledge of the trend rates of growth of Ml and time deposit
velocities, the sum of the b coefficients is expected to be negative

among all assets.

The coefficents on current and lagged interest rates are significant and

possess the correct sign. The sum of these coefficients which represents the
elasticity of substitution between Ml and tine deposits is 2.91. This compares to an elasticity of 6.09 between Ml and chartered bank personal savings
deposits obtained by Short and Villanueva 119771 using annual Canadian data

over the period 1951—1973. The calculated initial value of

Since rho is insignificant from one at the 5 percent level, the equation was

reestjmated in first difference form. The individual lag coefficients and the
mean lags are statistically identical as is the elasticity of substitution. We
conclude that equation (6) is a robust specification of the relative asset
demand of Ml and M3—M1 over the sample period in spite of the restrictive assumptions used in its derivation.

supports a rejection of the null hypothesis of structural stability.
Perhaps the most striking result of this regression is the fact that the

this is indeed surprising. Since the total sample still

If the hypothesized relationship between control of the money supply and

innovations in the underlying transactions technolor is valid, then it
should be possible to model these innovations with an additional variable

which reflects the degree of control. In other words, equation (6) is

hypothesis

suggests that chartered banks will have an incentive to

utilize costly resources to effect deposit substitution when they perceive a
reduction in the rate of growth of money relative to some average of past
rates. There are marrj reasons for believing that this relationship may

be

subject to significant lags. Banks will wish to insure that current downturns reflect a permanent reduction in the rate of growth of money before

undertaking expenditures for innovations. There may be delays before
research and development efforts culminate in innovations. Also, bringing

the new technolor on line may involve significant lags. Consequently it

seems appropriate to model these effects with a variable which provides
flexibility in the relationship between the rate of growth of money and innovations.

With the above in mind, we propose a variable defined as the difference

A priori, we expect d to be zero for the period 1962:4 — 1975:4 and nega-

tive for the period 1977:3 — 1982:3.

Equation (9) was estimated for the periods in question and the results are

presented in Table 6. For the period 1962:1 — 19T5:4, the coefficient on S is
insignificant as hypothesized. The constant term standard error declines but
there is no appreciable change in the lag structure or sum of lags on permanent

income. The last two lags on the interest rate turn insignificant. The standard error of the regression shows little change.

For the period 1977:3 — 1982:3, the coefficient on S possess the correct
sign and is highly significant. The constant term turns positive and is highly

significant. The estimate of 80 accordingly declines to 0.31 from 1.67. The
standard errors of the b coefficients decline appreciably and the sum of these

coefficients is now negative. The standard error of the equation declines by 55
percent. The addition of S also induces negative serial correlation.
Since the results in Table 6 indicate that the innovation prow performs
as hypothesized, we reestimated equation (9) with the restriction that d = 0
for the period 1962:1 through 1971:11-. The results of these regressions are pre.-

sented in Table 7.

A comparison of rows one and two reveals surprising similarity in the

underlying parameters of the transactions services technolor. The elasticity
of substitution is 2.91 in the first sample and 3.14 in the second sample. The
standard errors are 0.68 and 0.141 respectively. The initial values of 8 are of

the

correct magnitude and are very close. The sum

of

the b coefficients should

be considered identical.
Given the rather large differences in technolor between the two samples
implied by Table 5, we consider the conformity achieved by the addition
of S to

be quite remarkable. Recall that we

assumed innovations impact on the rela-

tive technolor coefficient rather than on the elasticity of substitution.
Also, our proxy variable for innovations could be considered crude at best.
Yet, inspite of these restrictive assumptions we are able to achieve a high
degree of conformity in parameters over the two samples. We conclude that this
evidence supports the hypothesis that the rise in the velocity of Ml above trend
over the past eight years can be linked causally to the decision of the Bank of
Canada to target on the growth rate of Ml.

III Conclusions

experience of Canada with a central bank policy of targeting Ml growth
suggests that there may be a fundamental difficulty in controlling the rate of
The

inflation through a policy of targeting on this variables. The evidence presented in this paper indicates that the degree of control of Ml growth does have
a significant role to play in explaining the rise in the velocity of Ml and, as a
consequence, the inflation rate has taken much longer to respond to restrictive
monetary policy than nest observers would have predicted prior to the policy
inactnient.

It would appear that the noninterest—bearing characteristic of Ml plays an
important role in explaining this causal link since it may, on occasion, provide

—28.-

chartered banks with an incentive to increase the monetary effectiveness of

other classes of deposits. However, this interpretation is not necessarily

warranted. Recall that Canada is free from restrictions on the payment of
interest on any type of deposit. Accordingly, chartered banks could have initiated interest payments on demand deposits in the face of sharply higher market

rates of interest. We argued that the differential reserve requirerxnt probably
influenced the decision to innovate rather than pay interest. Yet, as long as
the option of innovation is open to the private sector, there will always be the
possibility of nonprice competition through the enhancement of the transactions
efficiency of deposits.

The characteristic which appears to be critical in explaining the rise in Ml

velocity is the scope of the targeted aggregate. A narrow definition insures a
wide selection for deposit substitution through innovation. Therefore, the
case for control of a narrow aggregate would appear to be weakened considerably
by the evidence presented in this paper.

It is surprising that the strike of 1981:3 which lasted 143 days does

not generate the hypothesized underprediction of money. Could it be that the
general public is adapting to the frequent interruptions of postal service in
Canada?

10. The regression was run over the period 1972:14 to 1982:3. While the
sample contains observations prior to the hypothesized break about 1976:1, it
was necessitated by the minimum test requirement of forty observations.

11. For a formal derivation of this proposition the reader is referred to
Sargent and Wallace [1981].

12. This interpretation is due to Moroney and Wilbratte [1976]. In the
original article Chetty assumed a CES utility function and maximized utility

subject to a wealth constraint. The difficulty with this interpretation is that
it assumes the only motive for holding assets is to facilitate transactions services.

13. See Friedman [1979] for the theoretical argument for this type of
approach.

114. Moroney and Wilbratte also report positive autocorrelation in their

estimates of equation (6) for the U.S. using governnnt debt and corporate debt

as well as time deposits of commercial banks. Nor are they able to explain the
cause of the specification error.

15. In an earlier attempt we constructed a ratchet variable

utilizing rates

of growth of Ml of' a type

proposed by Simpson and Porter [19801. The use of a
ratchet variables seems warranted because once the costs of an
innovation have
been incurred it will be maintained

even if the forces leading to its adoption
are mitigated. However we found that the use of this type of variable
results
in insignificant b coefficients.
We interpret this result as evidence of multi—

collinearity between permanent income and the
expected, since both variables are dominated

by trend. Consequently, we

followed the approach described in the text.
