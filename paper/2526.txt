The Compliance Cost of Itemizing Deductions:
Evidence from Individual Tax Returns
1.

Introduction
The reenirce cost of operating the income tsx system is
large.

Although

economists have traditionalty focused on the allocative effects of
taxatIon,
Slemrod and Sorom (1984) recently eatmated the direct cost of
collecting Lndi—
vldual income taxes in 1982 to be between $30 and $35 billion, or seven to
eight percent of revenues raised.

They found that the time spent by taxpayers

in complying aith the tsx law (spproximstely two billion
hours, or twenty tours
per tax Jeer and one hundred million rsxpsyers) is equivslent to s hidden bureaucracy of one million full—time civil servants.

Approxmstely three—fourths

of this cost ass borne directly by taxpayers (as opposed to the Internal Rev-

enue Service) in the process of record keeping, resesrching the tsx
preparing the tax return itself.

law,

and

This high cost is adely perceived, se evi-

denced hy the emphasis in the recent tax reform effort on simplificstion, which
presumablj is related to reducing the resource cost of opersting the system.
The Tax Reform Act of 1986 reduced marginal tax rates, incressed the stsndsrd
deduction, snd eliminated some itemized deductions, sll of which srgushly could
reduce the cost of collection.

However, the econometric snalysfs presented in

Slemrod (1985) could find no support thst reducing margnsl tax rates would
reduce complsnce cost,

It did, though, suggest that reducing the fraction of

taxpayers that itemize deductions would reduce compliance cost sigmificsntly.
This paper provides further evidence about the compliance cost of itemizing deductions and the determinants of the cost.

Tn contrast to all previous

studies which rely on survey evidence, we infer this evidence from data reported on tsx returna, which of course contain no direct information on compliance coats.

We do, though, observe enough information about itemizing and

There is no stigma attached to itemizing one's deductions on a tax form.

For example, the resource cost of deducting a $1,000 hospital

bill is equal to the resource cost of deducting a $2,000 hospital bill for the
same set of hospital services.

(Hospital services are particularly attractive

in this regard, since it seems unlikely that the complexity of deductible expenses is responsive to this price.)

Likewise, the complexity of deducting a

property tax bill does not seem likely to depend on its magnitude.'

Table

shows how, as

the standard deduction is increased, the number of itemizing households declines and the total coat of itemizing declines.

An acrosa—the—board increase

of $2,000 in the standard deduction reduces the coat of compliance from $1.44
to $1.07 billion, or by $370 million,

Note also that the average coat of those

Thia occurs becauae the increased

The Tax Reform Act of 1986 contains several changes which affect the extent of itemization, including the disallowance of the sales tax deduction,

Conclusions
The U.S. income tax system allows taxpayers to deduct certain expenses

from taxable incone in order to improve horizontal equity and to encourage certain activities, such as charitable giving, deemed socially desirable.

This

paper estimates that the privately borne cost in 1982 of allowing itemizable
dsducticna above some limit amounted to $1.44 billion, with the social cost
being somewhat higher.

An increased standard deduction, as legislated in the

Tax Reform Act of 1986, enhances progresstvity, diminishes the horizontal ecucy
and incentive effects of itemization, but saves resource costs.

We estimate

that increasing all taxpayers' standard deduction by 51,000 would save $180
million in privately borne costs, and increasing it by $2,000 would save $370
million.
Earlier studies of the compliance cost of taxation have been based on aur—
vey responses, and therefore are subject to error due to faulty memory or deliberate misrepresentation.

How to value taxpayers' tine spent on tax matters

is also a difficult problem in such studies.

In addition, only tangible re-

source costs of compliance can be measured with any accuracy.

Footnotes
1.

The existence of a state income tax 15 likely to complicate the itemization procedure.

Adding a dummy variable for the presence of a state in-

come tax in the coat of compliance equation was unsuccessful——the likelihood would not converge.

Of the 13,409 recorda, only 80 were from states

without an income tax, so that this influence is unlikely to be qualitatively important.

2.

If investment income is included

as an explanatory variable of cost of

compliance, it is not statistically significant at common levels of
significance.

3.

The results reported here and in Table

4

for the lowest and highest adjusted

gross income classes were obtained by applying the mean characteristics of
the adjacent income class except in the case of income, in which case
55,000 was used for the less thsn $5,000 class and $100,000 was used for
the over $100,000 class.

4.

The nonmonotonicity probably reflects the fact that taxpayers with low reported adjusted gross income are often not "poor," but have temporarily low
annual income or have taken tax losses that reduce their income subject to
tax.
