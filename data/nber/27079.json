    "abstract": "\n\nHow should the design of incentives vary with agent time preferences? We develop two predictions.  First, \u201cbundling\u201d the payment function over time \u2013 specifically by making the payment for future effort increase in current effort \u2013 is more effective if individuals are impatient over effort.  Second, increasing the frequency of payment is more effective if individuals are impatient over payment.  We test the efficacy of time-bundling and payment frequency, and their interactions with impatience, using a randomized evaluation of an incentive program for exercise among diabetics in India. Consistent with our theoretical predictions, bundling payments over time meaningfully increases effort among the impatient relative to the patient.  In contrast, increasing payment frequency has limited efficacy, suggesting limited impatience over payments. On average, incentives increase daily steps by 1,266 (13 minutes of brisk walking) and improve health.\n\n",
