    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper develops new tools to study misallocation that do not require assumptions about the heterogeneity of firms\u2019 technologies. We show how features of the distribution of marginal products can be identified from exogenous variation in firms\u2019 input use and used both to test for misallocation and to quantify its resulting welfare losses. We apply this method to a setting with exogenous demand shocks from public procurement contracts for construction services in Ecuador. Our results reject the null of efficiency but our estimates of the resulting welfare losses from misallocation are small.\n\n",
