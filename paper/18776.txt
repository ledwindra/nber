Do Information Technologies Improve Teenagers’ Sexual Education? Evidence from a Randomized
Evaluation in Colombia

ABSTRACT
Across public junior high schools in 21 Colombian cities, we conducted a randomized evaluation
of a mandatory six-month internet-based sexual education course. Six months after finishing the
course, we find a 0.4 standard deviation improvement in knowledge, a 0.2 standard deviation
improvement in attitudes, and a 55% increase in the likelihood of redeeming vouchers for
condoms as a result of taking the course. We find no evidence of spillovers to control classrooms
within treatment schools, and we find treatment effects are enhanced when a larger share of a
student’s friends also takes the course. The low cost of the online course along with the
effectiveness we document suggests this technology is a viable alternative for improving sexual
education in middle income countries.

1. Introduction
Providing effective sexual education to teenagers is a pervasive world-wide policy challenge.
In many countries, conservative norms lead to restricted sexual education curricula. Deficient sexual
education partially explains the high levels of sexually transmitted diseases and teenage pregnancies
we observe in many of the world’s developing countries (WHO 2004). Making matters more
consequential for youth, in poor countries there is an acute lack of resources, health system
capabilities, and best practices to treat sexually-transmitted diseases (Fortson 2009).
We test whether, in a predominantly Catholic, middle income country, information
technologies in a school setting can help overcome sexual education related informational barriers
faced by teenagers. Naturally, evaluations of sexual health curricula have been done before. Review
papers by Kirby, Laris and Rolleri (2007), Chin et al. (2012), Fonner et al. (2014), and Goesling et al.
(2014) conclude that most comprehensive sexual education programs that have been evaluated
rigorously are effective at improving knowledge, attitudes, and self-reported behaviors. Fonner et al.
(2014) in particular focus on poor and middle income country studies and reach the same conclusion.
However, this large literature focuses on facilitator-led interventions, which implies that it is difficult
to ensure consistent delivery in face to face interventions when scaling up. Furthermore, many
teachers block this type of education because of discomfort discussing sex-related decisions with
teens. As a result of these factors, elaborate interventions struggle to translate encouraging results
from controlled trials into larger settings (Collins et al. 2002). ICT for sexual education hence holds
promise to improve school-based sexual education along three dimensions: loss of effectiveness
when scaling up, reducing costs of implementation and overcoming educator reluctance to present
sexual education material.
We shed light on this issue by implementing a large randomized evaluation of a
comprehensive internet-based sexual health education course geared to adolescents in Colombian
public schools. We randomize assignment to treatment both across 69 schools as well as within
schools at the classroom level (in order to measure information spillovers within school). The course
covers topics that range from sexual rights to the use of contraceptives. It was implemented during a
full academic semester in close collaboration with public schools as part of the students’ obligatory
curricula.
The sample consisted of 4,599 students enrolled in 138 ninth-grade classrooms from 69
public schools spread across 21 major Colombian cities. The control group received the status quo:

2

brief biology class coverage or sporadic visits by health personnel. 1 To measure differences in
outcomes after treatment, we use three sources of data: a follow-up survey one week after course
completion to measure short term changes in knowledge and attitudes, a second follow-up survey six
months after the course to measure the same outcomes in the longer term; and redemption from local
health clinics of a voucher for condoms.
The condom voucher allows us to avoid obvious problems with self-reported sexual behavior
data, and follows O’Donnell et al. (1995) and Thornton (2008). Increased condom demand and
distribution is a common policy target and tool as part of efforts to reduce sexually transmitted
infections and teenage pregnancy. We view this as a key part of the design of the study given the
concern in this literature regarding the relationship between knowledge and attitude outcomes and
actual behavior (Ross et al. 2007), and the challenge of gathering accurate responses to sensitive
questions on sexual practices.
We find a 0.38 standard deviation improvement in an index of sexual knowledge. The effects
are practically identical at completion of the course and six months later, suggesting little decay in
knowledge. We also find a 0.24 improvement in an index of sexual attitudes at course completion,
and a 0.17 standard deviation improvement after six months. These aggregate improvements in
sexual knowledge and attitudes suggest strong effects over time and across almost all of the
underlying sub-indices. 2
The sexual knowledge and attitude results are corroborated by the redemption rate of condom
vouchers. We find that 28 percent of treatment students redeem condom vouchers, compared to 18
percent of control students, representing a 55 percent increase in redemption. We do not find that the
online course increased sexual activity, which together with the increased condom demand result
suggests that the course results in improved sexual practice or at least safe-sex preparedness.
Our results do not provide any indication of classroom-level spillovers within the same
school, which suggests for policy purposes that programs should target entire cohorts, not a subset of
classrooms with expectations of spillovers leading indirectly to treatment. We do however find
evidence of a reinforcement effect through social networks. Treatment effects are greatest when a
large proportion of one’s friends were also treated (as discussed in Manski (2011)). 3

1

Control schools were asked not to modify their current sexual education because of their participation in the study.
The sexual knowledge index is composed of the following sub-indices: symptoms and causes of STIs, sexual
violence, prevention of STIs, pregnancy prevention, and condom use. The sexual attitudes index is composed of the
following sub-indices: Condom use, sexual conservativeness and sexual abuse reporting.
3
These results complement recent literature such as Fletcher (2007), Richards-Shubick (2011), and Card and
Giuliano (2012) who find that peer group norms have a first-order effect in explaining sexual health outcomes.

From a policy perspective, an internet based course has the major advantage of being very
low cost compared to human led interventions. In this intervention $1,000 is sufficient to provide a
course to 68 students for a whole semester. 4 We can then use the estimate of change in demand for
condoms due to the course to forecast that $1,000 would generate a reduction of 2.2 STIs among the
treated students. Given that averting a sexually transmitted disease is estimated in the literature to be
valued at $785 this implies a benefit-to-cost ratio of 1.72. Thus, our results point toward substantial
social benefits from this course as a method to improve sexual knowledge, attitudes, and future
sexual behavior at a relatively low cost.
There is an emerging literature studying the efficacy of computer-based educations in
developed countries. Noar et al (2009) reviews 12 published and unpublished studies using ICT in
sexual education among young adults (average age 22) in the United States (and one study in the
Netherlands) and finds a positive average effect, albeit with more null results than positive in the
individual studies. We extend these results by implementing a large-scale program through the public
high school system in Colombia, including analysis of knowledge and attitude spillovers through
social networks, and administrative (through redemption of condom vouchers) rather than selfreported data on condom use.
This research also relates to recent evidence suggesting that computers on their own do not
change academic outcomes in a discernible manner (Angrist and Lavy 2002; Krueger and Rouse
2004; Barrera-Osorio and Linden 2009; Fairlie and Robinson 2013). It complements this literature by
showing that, once computers have been installed in schools, structured internet courses – at least for
sexual education - can have significant effects.

2. Profamilia’s Internet-Based Sex Education Course
The online sexual education course was designed by the local NGO Profamilia. 5 Profamilia is
Colombia’s largest organization focused on sexual health and reproductive health. With more than 40
years of presence and over 1,800 employees nationwide, Profamilia is well known and used by the
local population for sexual health products and services such as contraceptives, HIV testing and
pregnancy tests. 6

Motivated by the stubbornly high level of some important adolescent sexual health indicators
nationwide, such as teenage pregnancy rates (DHS 2005), as well as legal changes, which mandated
the introduction of a sexual health curriculum in Colombian public schools, Profamilia embarked on
the design of a comprehensive online sexual education course designed for adolescents.
The curriculum aims to shape adolescents’ understanding and perceptions of sexuality, risks,
reproductive health, sexual rights, and dating violence. The overarching theme is a human rights
approach to pregnancy and teen sexuality. The course focuses on helping the students recognize
themselves as endowed with rights, such as the right to say no to sex, to access basic health services,
to access family planning services, and to live without sexual violence. 7 Profamilia’s course takes
full advantage of internet connectivity to provide an interactive experience and responsive,
anonymous counseling. The modules can be potentially accessed any time of day using a password
protected account, and there is a remote tutor available to answer questions via messages and support
the learning process. These features aim to create a safe social environment for adolescents to discuss
sensitive topics.
Treatment consisted of five modules. Students worked on the course for a total of 11 weeks.
Each group of treated students was initially given three weeks to become acquainted with the
platform and complete activities in the first module. After the first three weeks, each group was given
two weeks per module to complete activities in the remaining four modules. Each school dedicated
one session of 1.5 hours per week to allow the students to complete the course in the school’s
computer labs.
In school, each group taking the course worked with the presence of a teacher, who was
tasked with helping the students resolve questions about use of and access to the platform but not
questions related to the content of the course. Students were assisted and monitored by an online
tutor, who was a trained Profamilia counselor that dedicated part of his or her day to overseeing
students during their completion of the course. The tutors had two main roles: answering students’
questions about the course contents and monitoring the students’ performance. 8
At the end of every module, the tutor provided the teacher responsible for the group with a
grade for each student, based on the results of a test. To incentivize course completion, each school
participating in the course included these grades as a component of the grade of one school subject,
typically computer education. Each student had to complete module evaluations individually, which

were the basis for his or her individual performance report. Participation in the course was mandatory
for students.

3. Experimental Design and Estimation Strategies

Sample selection
In Colombia, 13.5 percent of adolescents become sexually active by age 15, and 60 percent
have sex before age 18. 9 Profamilia’s course targets 14-15 year olds precisely because they are close
to becoming sexually active. The sample frame for the study consists of ninth-grade students in
Colombian urban public secondary schools. Given our interest in cross-classroom spillovers, we
required enrolled schools to have at least two ninth-grade classes. Schools were also required to have
at least one computer room with internet access. 10 All participating administrators of the schools had
to consent for their school to participate in the field experiment before knowing the results of the
randomization. Schools agreed to facilitate data collection and coordination, to make a computer lab
available for the prescribed time every week (if selected to implement the course), and to not
substantially modify their sexual and reproductive health education for ninth-graders during the
study. A short questionnaire for school principals at baseline revealed that sexual education in our
sample was either non-existent, a topic covered in biology class, or consisted of one or two visits per
year by a health professional. Schools in the control group received a sports equipment package as
compensation at the end of the study.
The sample consists of 69 public secondary schools recruited in 21 cities across Colombia.11
From each school, two classrooms of ninth-graders were selected to participate in the study. If the
school had more than two classrooms of ninth-graders, a pair was randomly selected by us to partake
in the study.

9

Sexual education courses must ideally be targeted at children of the appropriate age to benefit from them. Very
young children may not yet be interested in sexuality issues, which points towards the benefits of targeting an older
age range. On the other hand, sexual education should in principle be provided before sexual initiation to convey its
full benefits. In the United States 15 percent of adolescents have sex before age 15 (Flanigan et al. 2006).
10
We selected schools with a functioning computer lab connected to the internet with at least one computer for
every three students. On average schools had 38 computers with a ratio of approximately one participating student
per computer.
11
The sample excludes rural public schools. In urban settings, it is common for schools in Colombia to have two
shifts per day (morning and afternoon). A student is offered a place at a certain shift before the beginning of the
school year and once a school is selected, he/she cannot take classes in other shifts or switch shifts. Given the lack of
interaction among children of different shifts, we treat different shifts in our sample as different schools. We use
both shifts for 13 schools in our sample.
6

Data collection strategy
We completed three rounds of a self-administered in-school pencil and paper survey. These
surveys were administered unannounced during class time, so as to minimize data collection costs
and attrition. The pencil and paper survey strategy was chosen instead of a computer survey because
treatment students would have more familiarity with computers at endline, hence unnecessarily
biasing results. The baseline survey was fielded at the beginning of the academic year, the second
one at the end of the semester (after taking the course), and the last survey was taken at the end of the
academic year, i.e. six months after the end of the course. The academic year bracketed the timeline
for our final survey data collection since beyond that point there is substantial student attrition due to
students switching schools, and more fundamentally, groups get reshuffled going into the 10th grade.
This meant that to interview our participants during the 10th grade we would have had to either locate
the students in their new groups for re-interviews or survey the whole cohort to locate the
participants’ responses ex-post. The first was deemed unfeasible by school administrators while the
latter option was beyond the budget for the study.
Six months after the end of the course, we offered students a voucher for six condoms with a
total market value of about $5 dollars. The offer was made via an email for all students and
additionally via an SMS message for those who provided us with a cell phone number (86 percent of
the sample). We then recorded which students redeemed their vouchers at the local health clinic by
matching the voucher number to the student the voucher was sent to. A timeline of the intervention
and data collection strategy is presented in Figure 1.
We focus on knowledge and attitudes indicators because these are the main outcomes of
interest in the literature studying young adolescents who for the most part have not had sex.
Furthermore, these two factors have been shown to be the strongest protective factors in preventing
STIs, HIV and pregnancy among teens (Kirby, Lepore, and Ryan 2005). Recent research has also
documented the important role that social norms play in responsible sexual behavior (Munshi and
Myaux 2005; Ashraf, Field, and Lee 2009). By changing knowledge and attitudes in youth attending
school, sexual education can ultimately play a fundamental role in achieving desirable aggregate
changes in sexual behavior.

Randomization Procedure
Because the sexual education course was part of the curriculum of a computer education (or
similar) course, treatment was at the classroom level. Hence our randomization unit is the classroom
(interchangeably referred to as group here). There are three types of classrooms: treatment, spillover
7

and control. The randomization is done in two stages. First, schools are randomly assigned to either
treatment or control. Then, within treatment schools, classrooms are randomly assigned to either the
treatment or spillover condition. A spillover classroom does not receive the treatment, but is in the
same school as one which does.
Table 1 shows the partition of schools and groups in the study. We study 138 groups spread
over 69 schools. Our total sample size is 4,599 students, with an average of 33 students per group. 46
groups were assigned to control (across 23 schools), 46 groups (across 46 schools) were assigned to
treatment, and 46 groups (across the same 46 schools) were assigned to the spillover condition.
Randomization of treatment was performed before the baseline survey. We obtained some basic
information about participating school characteristics, reported in Panel A of Table 2. After randomly
assigning groups to different conditions, we verified that assignment to treatment was not correlated
with any of the available variables. 12

Implementation
The sexual education course was implemented from August through November 2009 in
schools that began their school year in January 13 and from November 2009 through March 2010 in
schools that began their school year in September. As expected for a middle-income country, it was
not difficult to recruit schools with computer labs. However, it proved more difficult to recruit
schools with workable internet connections. In fact, in three of the 46 groups assigned to treatment,
lack of internet access prevented implementation of the internet-based course. 14 In some treatment
groups, students were unable to complete all five modules due to unforeseen events such as teacher
strikes. Grades on the tests at the end of each module were on average 4 out of 10, with a large mass
at zero (48 percent). Excluding those students with a score of zero, the average was 8 out of 10,
suggesting an acceptable degree of understanding for those actually taking the course and the tests.
The high proportion of scores equal to zero highlights the challenges of student compliance
associated with internet-based education. Panel B in Table 2 shows summary statistics by treatment

12

Specifically, we drew randomizations with different starting seed values, testing each one for orthogonality on the
set of covariates listed in Panel A, and then stopping when a randomization yielded no t-stat larger than 2.0. As
discussed in Bruhn and McKenzie (2009), a better approach, rather than what we did, defines a set number of
randomizations (e.g., 10,000) and then chooses the one with the most orthogonal assignment.

condition. The average age is 15 years, 43 percent of the sample is male, and 32 percent have a
computer at home. 15

Baseline Balance
Panels A and B of Table 2 show there are no statistically significant differences across
treatment, spillover and control groups except for gender: the control group has 7.6 percentage points
and 8.8 percentage points more males than the treatment and spillover groups, respectively.
Furthermore, an F-test from a regression of treatment assignment on a full set of baseline
characteristics does not reject the null hypothesis that all baseline coefficients are jointly equal to
zero (reported in the final row of each panel).

Attrition
Attrition was 13 percent between baseline and first follow-up, and 10 percent between
baseline and second follow-up. Appendix Table A2 shows there is no differential attrition between
control and treatment, and control and spillover students. We also analyze attrition for the condom
voucher offer. Because students had to provide a valid cell phone number and/or email in order to be
offered the condom voucher, the offer could not be made to every student in the study. 31 percent of
students were missing both pieces of information due to non-response, misspelled email addresses, or
invalid phone numbers, and could not be offered the vouchers. The table shows there was no
difference in condom voucher offers between control and treatment groups or between control and
spillover groups. When we interact treatment group with socioeconomic status of the family 16 or
with mother’s and father’s education, we find there was no differential attrition by socioeconomic
status for any of the comparisons.

Econometric Specification
Randomization allows for identification of reduced form intent-to-treat effects. Let 𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖

denote an outcome of interest at follow-up (t =1 or 2) for individual i in classroom j. Treatment and
spillover classroom assignment dummies are denoted by 𝑇𝑗 and 𝑆𝑗 respectively. Treatment
classrooms were selected for internet-based sexual health training whereas spillover classrooms were

not selected for the training but are in a school that has a treated classroom. Whenever available, we
include the baseline dependent variable as control for precision. We estimate the following
regression model via ordinary least squares as our main specification:
𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼1 + 𝛽1 𝑇𝑗 + 𝛽2 𝑆𝑗 + 𝛽3 𝑌𝑖𝑖0 + 𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖 ,

(1)

where the error term 𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖 is assumed to be uncorrelated across schools but not necessarily within

them. Hence, we cluster standard errors at the school level. Because 𝑇𝑗 and 𝑆𝑗 were randomly

assigned, the estimated coefficients are unbiased estimators of the intent-to-treat effects of the course,
which we argue are the policy coefficients of interest. We have multiple measures of sexual health
knowledge and attitudes in the survey. However, testing multiple outcomes using (1) for each
measure independently increases the probability of rejecting a true null hypothesis for at least one
outcome above the significance level used for each test (Duflo, Glennerster, and Kremer 2008).
Hence, we follow Kling, Liebman and Katz (2007) and define a summary measure 𝑌 ∗ as the
unweighted average of all standardized outcomes in a family. That is, we obtain:
𝑌∗ =

∑𝑘 𝑌𝑘∗
𝑘

, where 𝑌𝑘∗ =

𝑌𝑘 −𝜇𝑘
𝜎𝑘

.

For standardization of each variable 𝑌𝑘 we use the mean (µ) and variance (σ2) at baseline.

This allows the estimates 𝛽1 and 𝛽2 to be interpreted as the effects of the course in terms of standard
deviations of the outcome at baseline.

4. Results
We present our main results in Tables 3-5, reporting effects on knowledge (Table 3), attitudes
(Table 4), and individual indicators of sexual behavior and condom redemption in Table 5. For each
indicator, whenever available we include the results from both follow-ups, the first taken one week
after the end of the intervention and the second one taken six months after the end of the intervention.
10

While we focus more on the results of the second follow-up, the comparisons of effects between the
short- and medium-run give us an indication of the durability of the effects.

Knowledge
Table 3 presents the impacts on five different standardized knowledge indices measuring: a)
STI symptoms and causes, b) recognition of instances of sexual violence, c) STI prevention, d)
pregnancy prevention methods, and e) proper condom use. Columns (11) and (12) in the table show
results for an overall index using all the variables used in the partial indices.17 The table notes report
the definition of the individual variables used in the construction of each index.
The aggregate knowledge index shows a 0.37 SD increase in overall knowledge one week
after the intervention and a 0.38 SD increase in overall knowledge six months after the intervention
compared to students not assigned to the course, and both coefficients are statistically significant at
the 1 percent level. Furthermore, we find a robust pattern of positive coefficients in all components
of the general index as well as statistical significance at least at the 5 percent level six months after
the intervention.
The table also shows there is no clear pattern of decay in knowledge outcomes, since some
improve while others decrease over time. The second row in the table also shows that we do not find
clear evidence for cross-classroom spillover effects in terms of sexual knowledge.

Attitudes
Table 4 presents results on attitude indicators. Columns (1) and (2) present results on
attitudes towards the use of condoms, (3) and (4) on conservatism with respect to age of initiation of
sexual activities, (5) and (6) on attitudes toward denouncing and seeking help in the event of sexual
abuse, and columns (7) and (8) show results for an overall index of attitudes, containing all variables
used in columns (1-6).
For the general attitudes index we find significant effects of 0.24 SD in terms of attitudes one
week after the intervention and 0.17 SD six months after. Significant effects were again found for
each sub-index six months after the intervention and the pattern of positive effects on all partial
indices is again apparent.

17

For space reasons, we do not report results on every individual outcome but they are available upon request. The
general indices calculate the average for all non-missing outcomes at the individual level. For the partial sub-indices,
which are composed of few variables, we drop observations which have missing values for any component of the
sub-index. This gives the reader information about item non-response.
11

The training was successful in generating more positive attitudes towards the use of condoms
at the first follow-up (0.17 SD) and at the second follow-up (0.10 SD). In the sexually conservative
attitudes sub-index composed of the following variables: a) indicates that individuals their age should
not have multiple sexual partners in the same month; b) thinks it is too early for individuals of their
age to engage in sexual activities; and c) feels confident he/she will be able to wait to have sex until
emotionally prepared to do so, teens scored 0.13 SD higher six months after the intervention. Column
(6) shows that treated teens are 0.11 SD more likely to agree with the need to report cases of sexual
abuse to the authorities and the need to seek medical attention in such situations. For attitude
indicators, we again find no consistent evidence of spillovers across classrooms. 18

18

We also looked for spillover effects using a dose response model but also failed to detect classroom level spillover
effects. Specifically, we created a regressor which is the spillover indicator divided by the number of classrooms in
grade 9 in the school. Spillover coefficients followed the same pattern of no significant effects.
12

Sexual Activity and Condom Demand
Table 5 reports results on sexual activity and condom voucher redemptions. Specifically,
columns 1-3 report effects of the course on self-reported sexual activity six months after the end of
the course. 19 Columns 1-3 uniformly show that the course did not increase or decrease self-reported
sexual activity among adolescents. Column 1 shows that students were not more likely to be sexually
active in the past six months compared to the control group. Similarly, the frequency of sex did not
change in the previous six months compared to the control group (column 2) nor in terms of number
of partners (column 3). The finding that sexual education does not result in increases in sexual
activity is a robust finding in this literature (c.f. Kirby Laris and Rolleri 2007).
Of course, the validity of studies using self-reported sexual behavior among adolescents has
long been a criticism in this literature (Brener, Billy, and Grady 2003). We addressed this challenge
by measuring the percentage of students who redeem vouchers for condoms. 20 This strategy allows
us to address the possible lack of reliability in self-reported outcomes via an objective safe-sex
behavior metric. Condom availability is important for adolescent health given the sporadic nature of
adolescent sexual activity. Column 4 in Table 5 reports the results of the voucher experiment.
The administrative data from voucher redemption shows statistically significant and
important effects. We find that 28 percent of treatment students redeem them, compared to 18
percent of control students, a 55 percent increase in redemption (p=0.05). We put substantial weight
on this result as it provides objective evidence of an increase in condom demand. In unreported
results, we find that the coefficient is basically unchanged when controlling for distance to the health
clinic.
We conducted bounding exercises with differing assumptions on attrition, as in Karlan and
Valdivia (2011), and find that the positive effect on condom voucher in Table 5 (0.099** (0.055))
still holds after imputing the mean minus 0.10 standard deviations of the observed treatment
distribution to the non-respondents in the treatment group, and after imputing the mean plus 0.10
standard deviations of the observed control distribution to non-respondents in the control group. 21

19

Note that for this table the dependent variables are not an index but a single variable, so we do not standardize
them. This has the benefit of allowing for comparability with other studies. Furthermore, in this table there is no
control for baseline value of the dependent variable because it was not available at baseline (except for column 3).
20
Given that the objective population is teens at high risk of sexual initiation, the setting is not designed to capture
other sexual behavior outcomes such as pregnancy and STIs, given their extremely low prevalence. We nevertheless
asked about some of these outcomes in the survey (self-reported) and found no statistically significant changes for
the overall treatment effect on these self-reported outcomes, as expected.
21
Results of these simulations are not presented here but are available upon request.
13

Friendship network spillovers and reinforcing interactions
Next we take advantage of the fact that in the surveys we asked students to identify their
closest friends by name, and indicate if they were in the same school and/or classroom. We use this
information to match each student’s social network to the list of students in the treatment and
spillover groups. This allows us to analyze treatment and spillover effects differentiating between
students for whom a small or a large percentage of friends was also treated.
Table 6 presents summary statistics about the network treatment distribution. The table
shows substantial variation in the number of friends that are located in the same classroom as a
treatment student. However, for students in a spillover classroom, there are few links to students
taking the course (in the treatment classroom). Indeed, 89 percent of spillover students have no best
friends in the treatment classroom - this will affect the precision of the spillover estimates.
With this information, we obtain the proportion of the student’s network of closest friends
who were treated (friends in a treatment classroom / total listed friends). 22 If a student and his or her
entire network of close friends were all in the same treatment classroom, then the proportion is equal
to one, but if the network of friends includes students from other classrooms or from outside the
school, then the proportion is lower. We use variation in the proportion of close friends that are in the
student’s classroom to estimate a heterogeneous treatment effects regression in which the main
effects are now interacted with the proportion of friends in the network who were treated (𝐹𝑖𝑖 ). The
specification becomes:

′′
,
𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼3 + 𝛽16 𝑇𝑗 + 𝛽17 (𝐹𝑖𝑖 × 𝑇𝑗 ) + 𝛽18 𝑆𝑗 + 𝛽19 (𝐹𝑖𝑖 × 𝑆𝑗 ) + 𝛽20 𝑁𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽21 𝑌𝑖𝑖0 + 𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖

(3)

where Nij is a control for the number of friends the individual has, 23 and as before, standard errors are
clustered at the school level. In Tables 7, 8, and 9 the interpretation of the main effect (𝑇𝑗 ) now
becomes the effect of assignment to treatment for someone who has zero friends also treated,
whereas the coefficient on (𝐹𝑖𝑖 × 𝑇𝑗 ) is the additional effect of the course for someone whose full set

of friends are also treated (analogously for 𝑆𝑗 ).

In interpreting these results, the reader should be cognizant that the distribution of a student’s

network of friends is not a randomly assigned variable. The identifying variation is coming from

22

One shortcoming of our network analysis is that the questionnaire did not clearly differentiate between friendship
and romantic relationships.
23
This is calculated as the number of people who mentioned individual i as a best friend.
14

whether the student’s friends are in his or her classroom or are rather in another classroom in the
school or from outside of the school. This may lead to bias if, for example, more extroverted students
have a larger proportion of their best friends in the classroom and this extrovertedness is related to
the outcome beyond the effect stemming from social reinforcement. For this reason, we condition on
Nij, the number of individuals that mention a student as a best friend. 24 The necessary assumption
hence becomes that the proportion of friends in the classroom is related to the treatment response
only through the network effects (conditional on the number of friends).
With this assumption in mind, we present the results for network interactions in Tables 7, 8,
and 9 which report effects six months after finishing the course. Table 7 provides clear evidence of a
significant reinforcing interaction effect for students in the treatment group in terms of the overall
knowledge index (Column 6). We are able to identify an effect of 0.46 SD in knowledge for wholly
treated networks, as opposed to a 0.28 SD effect if the student’s network is not treated. In contrast,
we do not find significant effects for spillover students, even if their network was fully treated. As
noted before, we obtain large standard errors for the spillover estimates due to the small number of
spillover students with treated networks. At the bottom of each column we report the p-value from a
test of equality of the friendship interaction effects for treatment and spillover students. The
reinforcing interaction effect is positive, large and significant for all five sub-indices except for the
sexual violence knowledge and condom use knowledge ones (Columns 2 and 5).
Table 8, on attitude indicators, shows an even starker reinforcing interaction effect. In this
case, the effects are significant only if the student’s friendship network also took the course. For
example, if a student’s full network was treated, the student is predicted to have a 0.24 SD higher
attitude index score, whereas the estimated effect is only 0.04 SD if no one in his or her friendship
network was treated. Similar outcomes are observed in each of the subcomponents of the index. As
in Table 7, there is no significant network spillover effect for a student that did not take the course.
This provides evidence that the relevant group for a reinforcement effect is the network of friends, as
suggested in Sacerdote (2011).
Table 9 presents evidence of reinforcing interaction effects for self-reported sexual behavior:
students with more friends taking the course report significantly lower sexual activity than those with
fewer friends taking the course for two out of three indicators.
Column 4 reports results for condom redemption. In contrast to the network interaction
results in knowledge and attitudes, the condom redemption results are not significant, although the
24

When looking at determinants of being more popular in school, we find that kids that are more popular are less
likely to smoke, drink and consume drugs at baseline.
15

signs of the coefficients are consistent with Tables 8 and 9 in the sense that they point to an
improvement the larger the share of friends that is treated. Indeed, treatment students are 8
percentage points more likely to redeem their vouchers than the control group even if none of their
close friends were treated (not statistically significant). The coefficient estimate on the reinforcing
interaction suggests a 4.3 percentage point higher condom demand for those with all friends being
treated but again the coefficient is not statistically different from zero.
Column 4 also shows a puzzling result in which spillover students whose entire friend
networks were treated are 14 percentage points less likely to redeem their condom vouchers than the
control group. Note there is a small number of observations in the spillover group with friendship
links to treated students and the results in all the other indicators do not show a pattern of significant
spillovers from classroom to classroom, so we do not attach much importance to this coefficient.
We interpret the heterogeneous effects findings by share of friends being treated as providing
evidence that peer effects occur through friendship networks, but that very few network links occur
across classrooms in the same grade for us to be able to identify them in the data.

Cost-Effectiveness and Cost-Benefit Analysis
The marginal cost of the Profamilia course is approximately $14.60 per student. The bulk of
this cost ($10) is accounted for by the remote tutor, and the remainder comes from internet platform
costs and computer depreciation. In our calculations, we do not include opportunity costs of the time
of the students (e.g., some alternative educational activity, or leisure or work outside of school). 25
Compared to non-computer-based sexual health interventions in the U.S., which range from $69 to
more than $10,000 per student, 26 the Profamilia course is extremely low cost. It is also low cost
compared to instructor-led programs in developing countries. Kivela, Ketting and Baltussen (2013)
report costs per student of teacher-led school based sexual education programs of $27 in Kenya and
$85 in Indonesia. 27
We present our cost effectiveness and cost-benefit calculations in Table 10. These estimates
obviously rest on many assumptions, but they provide much value for policy makers by allowing for
comparisons across different interventions.
25
In our calculations, we also exclude the wage cost of the person supervising students in the computer lab because
it is unlikely that a school would hire personnel exclusively for the course. This is in line with guidelines by
Dhaliwal et al. (2011), who argue that cost-effectiveness should use marginal costs of adding the program, assuming
fixed costs are incurred with or without the program.
26

27
Costs refer to one semester of the course and are expressed in 2012 dollars.

16

Our key result is that students who take the course are 9.9 percentage points more likely to
redeem the condom voucher. For the purposes of Table 10, we interpret this to indicate a consistent
condom user. This allows us to link our coefficient to the literature documenting the effect of
consistent condom use on STIs. (i.e. Gallo et al. 2007). In support of making this assumption, Shaffi,
Stovel and Holmes (2007) show that adolescents who use a condom at sexual debut are significantly
more likely to have used a condom in their most recent intercourse (on average 6.8 years after sexual
debut) and are 50% less likely to test positive for chlamydia or gonorrhea.
Gallo et al. (2007) estimate that consistent condom use leads to a 60% reduction in likelihood
of having an STI. Using their baseline STI rate and multiplying by our 9.9 percentage point increase
in condom user result, our estimate would imply a 3.2 percentage point reduction in STI prevalence.
This in turn means that $1,000 spent on the course generates 2.2 averted STIs, with a 90%
confidence interval of [0.19, 4.20].
To link the reduction in STIs to disability adjusted life years (DALYs), we use the genderspecific distribution of STIs and the implied DALYs lost per STI incident from Ebrahim et al.
(2005). In particular, the latter finds that for every STI episode, 0.11 DALYs are lost. 28 Using the
estimate of value per DALY of $7,142 in Brent (2011) 29 suggests that the benefit of averting an STI
is $785. We obtain a similar estimate ($634) if we use the lifetime costs of an STI presented in Ruger
et al. (2012). The lower panel of Table 10 summarizes our cost-benefit calculation. We estimate that
the course averts one STI at a cost of $455, indicating a benefit to cost ratio of 1.72, well above one.
This implies that the course is socially desirable even with typical deadweight loss factors due to
taxation (Auriol and Wartlers 2012).

5. Conclusions
We provide evidence that information technologies can be a powerful tool to provide
effective sex education in contexts in which informational barriers may pose a challenge to
policymakers. In contexts in which teachers may be unwilling or unable to provide sexual education,
internet-based courses may prove a useful substitute for in-person instruction, and are also more
scalable due to the lower marginal cost of delivering the curricula to students.
The results presented here show that a six-month web-based sexual education course in
Colombian public schools was effective in improving broad measures of knowledge and attitudes
𝐸(∆𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷|𝑆𝑆𝑆 = 1) = ∑𝑘𝑖=1 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑖 ∙ Pr(𝑆𝑆𝑆 = 𝑖|𝑆𝑆𝑆 = 1), where i represents {Chlamydia, gonorrhea,
trichomoniasis, syphilis, other curable STDs, PID, genital herpes, cervical cancer, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV}.

among teenagers, and that the course also led to a substantial increase in the rate of condom voucher
redemption. This last measure provides plausible evidence that the course was effective in changing
safe sex practices, where the novelty of this approach is that it provides strong evidence that
anonymity and confidentiality of information technologies may be of great use in segments of the
society in which keeping such anonymity is difficult to overcome. 30
Our results on knowledge and attitudes are important because these two factors have been
shown to be the strongest protective factors in preventing STIs, HIV and pregnancy among teens
(Kirby, Lepore, and Ryan 2005). Furthermore, recent research has documented the important role
that social norms play in responsible sexual behavior (Munshi and Myaux 2005; Ashraf, Field, and
Lee 2009). By changing knowledge and attitudes in youth attending school, sexual education can
ultimately play a fundamental role in achieving desirable aggregate changes in sexual behavior.
A second contribution to the sexual health education literature is the focus on spillovers,
through a two-stage experimental design. The results indicate that spillovers from treated to untreated
classrooms in the same school are negligible. We find strong indications that effects of the course
were reinforced when treated individuals had larger percentages of their friend networks in treatment
classrooms. The evidence is robust across a large set of sexual health attitude and knowledge
indicators. In particular, we found that students whose networks were more intensely treated had
significant improvements in knowledge and attitudes, which we interpret as social reinforcement
effects or complementarities. These results demonstrate the positive externalities of the public
provision of sex education: when an individual takes a sex education course, this decision has
positive effects on sexual health outcomes among his or her close friends. This suggests that without
collective action, there is an under provision of sex education.
Our results provide an optimistic assessment of the use of information technologies to
generate improved sexual health outcomes among the youth. The cost-benefit analysis suggests that
because internet-based sexual health education programs are extremely low cost, their benefits in
terms of STI reductions actually justify the costs.

30

This approach provides an alternative to social marketing campaigns that attempt to increase the use of condoms
in developing countries, and may be better suited than the latter for the segments of the population described in this
paper. Among others, in Tanzania, a campaign to promote condom use among women was entitled “Talk to Him”
and included posters and depicting a variety of confident, empowered, young women (AIDSCAP 1997).
