Inflation and Wage Dispersion

ABSTCT
A large body of empirical

work

has derriorfstrated that higher

inflation,

especially when it is unexpected, leads to greater dispers.ior in the

distribution of price changes across subaggregates, A sparse and more recent
literature suggests exactly the opposite effects on the distribution of wage

changes. This study first

reconciles

these apparently opposite results usinc

a model in which shocks to the econom> can affect both wages and prices and
the demand for indexing. If the positive effect of shocks on the demand for
indexing is sufficiently large, the dispersion of changes in wages or prices
will be reduced even though the shocks' direct effect is to incr-ease this

dispersion. Impl icitly from the evidence, this offset is large enough in
wage—setting, but not so large in price determination.
Additional evidence on the relationship between inflation and the
dispersion of wage changes is provided by empirical i.iork for 14 israeli

manufacturing industries, 156—82. The results suggest that in Israel, Just as
in the United States (on which previous work has been conducted) with its much
less rapid and variable inflation, dispersion also decreased with unexpected
price inflation.

I. Introduction
The relation between inflation and relative price variability has

received increasing attention in recent years. Several authors have found
that increased relative price variability is associated with increases in
unanticipated inflation (Parks, 1978; Fischer, 1982; Cukierman and Wachtel,

1982, to name a few). The apparent pervasiveness of this phenomenon across
countries (see, for example, Cukierman and Leiderman, 1981, for discussion of
the Israeli experience) has led to a wide acceptance of the view that this
positive correlation is (to use Friedman's terminology) an empirical
"regularity" of economic systems.

1

Hamermesh (1986) has considered the relation between unexpected
inflation and relative wage variability in the United States and found that

the "regularity" does not hold. Increases in unexpected inflation tended to
narrow the dispersion of wage changes across sectors in the period 1955—81.
Allen (1984) finds similar results for the postwar U.S., but finds that
unexpected inflation widened the dispersion of relative wage changes in the
United States before World War II.

These results raise at least two questions. First, is the narrowing of
wage dispersion in response to inflation unique to the postwar United States,
or is it characteristic of other economies as well, particularly those with

much higher and more variable rates of price inflation? Second, if lower wage
variability is a general result, how might it be consistent with the above

results on price variability? The purpose of this note is to address these
two issues.

II.

A General Framework
We

begin by setting out a prototype model that can account for both a

positive and a negative relation between inflation and price dispersion,

depending on the nature of the price—setting process. The key question is
whether prices are set before or after an aggregate nominal shock Is

observed. If price and quantity decisions must be made before the realization
of the inflation shock is known, increased unanticipated inflation will
increase relative price dispersion in a model where there is a confusion of

aggregate and relative shocks. If, however, indexing arrangements allow
prices to be adjusted after nominal shocks have been observed, a higher mean
level of unanticipated inflation (that is, greater inflation uncertainty) may

increase the degree of indexing and reduce price dispersion. In short, the
effect of inflation on the dispersion of wage or price changes depends on the
nature of price—setting——whether prices are set ex ante or ex post the
realization of aggregate nominal shocks——and how inflation changes the nature
of price—setting arrangements.

(so that the second right—hand side term in (1) can be thought of as a real—

balance effect), and w(i) is a random (excess) demand shock.
—

p(i)

is the locally perceived relative price, so

that ii(i) and y(i) are demand and supply elasticities (u, ' > 0) ,

which can

vary across markets. This characteristic is crucial to the results.
The excess demand shock is assumed normal with mean zero and

variance cy2, and w(i) is uncorrelated over time and across markets. The rate

This general set—up is almost identical to that used

in Cukierman and Leiderman (1984).

We model price—setting and indexing as follows. In each period the

4

market—clearing price is observed, and the market—clearing quantity is

transacted. Agents may decide that the price actually paid may be adjusted ex
has been observed. An indexing arrangement then takes the

where 3(i) is an indexing parameter in the i'th market.

In the case where no indexing is used, p(i) =

In

the other polar

case, where sector—specific demand shocks are not allowed to influence prices,
(5) becomes:

+

where the first two terms in (5') are known at time t.

We can now compute the dispersion of equilibrium relative prices under
different assumptions about the weights given to sector—specific demand shocks

and ex—post indexing in setting individual prices. For simplicity, assume
that the degree of indexing is the same across sectors, so that

Equation (16) summarizes the determinants of relative price variability. The
second term shows that relative price variability depends, naturally, on the

varability of relative excess demand shocks. The first term shows that it
depends on the level of the unanticipated nominal shock (an effect discussed
by Hercowitz, 1981; 1982), with the size of the effect determined by the
extent of indexing. Given i3

individual utility is a decreasing function of the price variability of one

price,

2

an optimal response to an increase In a is a higher degree of

indexing.

This model can obviously be extended in a number of ways. Differential
indexing would increase relative price (or wage) dispersion. More complicated
indexing schemes (such as an explicit relation of the degree of indexing to

observed economic variables) would enrich this model. Our purpose here was to
present a model in which the effects of different methods of price—setting
could be studied and the possibility of their different effects on the
dispersion of relative prices and wages be explored.

III. Testing the Dispersion Hypothesis
The theoretical model suggests that, where indexing is a possibility,
Increases in unanticipated inflation may actually lower dispersion by

increasing the degree of (implicit or explicit) indexing. As an evaluation of
the applicability of these ideas, annual data from the Israeli economy were
used to examine the model describing the variability of relative wage changes

between 1956 and 1982. Data covering 14 manufacturing and mining industries,
accounting for approximately 90 percent of output in these sectors, were

used.

With its rapid and highly variable inflation, Israel may be a good

Da2

9

example of an economy in which wage—setting is characterized by changes in the
degree of formal, and especially informal indexing as uncertainty about
inflation varies.

Using the same equation for calculating the variance of relative wage
changes as in Haniermesh (1986), we computed Var (w) as the weighted average of

4

annual changes in the relative nominal daily wage rates of workers. —

The

same formula was used to calculate the variance of changes in relative output,
Var(y), with output being measured by the index of industrial production for
each industry.

The annual inflation rate, p, was calculated as the twelve—month
average of annualized monthly rates of change in the Consumer Price Index in
Israel. Unlike the TJnited States, in which several surveys on expectations
about price inflation exist (and are used in Hamermesh, 1986), no comparable

series exist in Israel. To test the model we thus construct inflation

forecasts based on macro time series. The first forecast uses monthly rates
of inflation to construct ARIt'IA forecasts for one, two, three, etc., up to

twelve months ahead. In each case the most recent seven years of data on

prices were used. Thus, for example, data on monthly inflation rates from
1948—1954 were used to construct an ARIMA forecast of the monthly inflation

rates in 1955. while different ARIMA structures characterized different
seven—year time periods in Israeli inflation in the past 35 years, in most
cases integrated autoregressive processes involving one— and twelve—month lags

had the greatest explanatory power. Thus the series pe was constructed using

these forecasts. Unexpected inflation using this forecast is p —

The second forecast of inflation is the naive projection of the
previous year's rate of price inflation, p_1. Such a simple forecast may
prove adequate in an economy such as Israel's, in which inflation until the

10

1980's has seemed to fluctuate randomly on several plateaus between which

there are discrete jumps. Unexpected inflation based on this forecast is p —

p_i.
The basic data (other than Var y) are shown in Table 1. It is apparent
that, as in the United States, there is no particular trend in Var w. The
series does show substantial variability, but some of the lowest values are
observed in the early 1980s, the years of most rapid inflation in Israeli

history. The forecasts p track the broad trends in inflation fairly well,
but seem to predict poorly the yearly variation in inflation rates in the

early part of the sample period. This is undoubtedly the result of the rapid
annual fluctuations in inflation in the early 1950s and the lack of a
significant trend term In the forecasting equations in that period.

The estimates of the determinants of Var w are presented in Table 2.

The equations were estimated using the Cochrane—Orcutt adjustment for serial
correlation in the errors. As in Hamermesh's (1986) results for the United
States, increases in the dispersion of output shocks increase the dispersion

of wage changes. As the estimates In the first column show, though, there is
essentially no relation between Var w and the actual rate of price

inflation. In both the United States and Israel, and contrary to the received
wisdom about the effects of price inflation on the dispersion of relative
prices, the data do not Indicate any relation between inflation and relative
wage dispersion.

As In the United States, however, once the series on price inflation is
decomposed into expected and unexpected components we observe a striking
relationship

between inflation and Var w. Neither of the two inflation

a significant effect on the dispersion of relative

wage changes. However, In both cases, and especially for the naive forecast,

p_1, unexpected inflation, the deviation of the actual inflation rate from the
forecast, has a negative effect on the dispersion of relative wage changes.

The term representing unexpected inflation is highly significant in the
equation using p_1, and is significantly different from zero at the 90—percent

Whether the very strong results using the forecast

depends partly on which

forecast predicts annual inflation rates better. Some evidence on this
question is presented in Table 3, showing regressions of the inflation rate on

these forecasts. As the Table makes clear, the R2 is higher for the naive
forecast than for the annualized monthly ARIMA forecast; and the latter does
not add to the explanatory power of the lagged forecast when both are included

in the same regression. We may conclude from this that the results based on

6

the naive forecast deserve greater attention. —

Conclusions

In this note we have shown how relative prices and wages are affected

by shocks to relative demand and to the entire economy. We have demonstrated
that their effects depend on whether they also affect the extent of indexing

of price— and/or wage—setting. In particular, if greater absolute shocks to
the economy increase the demand for indexation, those shocks can reduce

dispersion in wage— and/or price—setting. Without any change in indexation,
though, larger shocks will increase dispersion.

Earlier empirical work has shown that inflationary shocks have
increased the dispersion of relative price changes in the postwar United

States, while decreasing the dispersion of relative wage changes. Similarly,
other work has

demonstrated

that (the much larger) inflationary shocks have

increased the dispersion of relative price changes in Israel. Our empirical
work shows that, as in the United States, those shocks reduce the dispersion

of relative wage changes in Israel. Taken as a whole and in conjunction with
the model set forth here, the results indicate that inflationary shocks induce
workers to seek (formal and informal) indexing to such an extent that

relative—wage variability declines in response to the shock. While shocks may
induce some increase in the indexing of price—setting arrangements, it is
implicitly less extensive, as it is insufficient to offset the positive

effects of the shocks on the observed dispersion in relative prices. The
difference between wage— and price—setting in an environment of inflationary
shocks may perhaps be due to the greater risk aversion of individuals in their
roles as workers than as consumers.

One should note the finding of Hercowitz (1982). He argued that both
relative price dispersion and unanticipated inflation may be thought of as
endogenous, being driven by, among other things, monetary shocks. He found no
significant correlation between unanticipated money shocks and relative price
variability in postwar U.S. data.
