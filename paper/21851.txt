The Effect of Disability Insurance Payments on Beneficiaries’ Earnings

NBER Working Paper No. 21851
January 2016
JEL No. H31,I18,J14,J22
ABSTRACT
A crucial issue in studying social insurance programs is whether they affect work decisions through
income or substitution effects. We examine this in the context of U.S. Social Security Disability Insurance
(DI), one of the largest social insurance programs in the U.S. The formula linking DI payments to
past earnings has discontinuous changes in the marginal replacement rate that allow us to use a regression
kink design to estimate the effect of payment size on earnings. Using Social Security Administration
data on all new DI beneficiaries from 2001 to 2007, we document a robust income effect of DI payments
on earnings. Our preferred estimate is that an increase in DI payments of one dollar causes an average
decrease in beneficiaries’ earnings of twenty cents. This suggests that the income effect represents
an important factor in driving DI-induced reductions in earnings.

I. Introduction
A core issue in public and labor economics is how public programs affect work decisions.
One of the key questions is whether such programs affect work outcomes through income or
substitution effects. Separating these is necessary to predict the effects of policy reforms and
their welfare consequences. U.S. Social Security Disability Insurance (DI) protects workers
against the risk of disability through cash payments and Medicare eligibility. Approximately
seven percent of federal outlays are spent on DI and associated Medicare expenses, and around
five percent of 25-64 year-olds receive DI. Since 1979, the fraction of the population on DI has
increased by more than two percentage points, and real expenditures on DI and associated
Medicare expenditures have more than tripled (U.S. Treasury 2015, Social Security
Administration (SSA) 2015).
The primary goal of this paper is to estimate the effect of the magnitude of DI cash
payments on beneficiaries’ earnings. Our main outcome is pre-tax earnings while on DI, which is
relevant to evaluating the net effects of DI expenditures on the government budget, as well as to
welfare evaluation (Chetty 2009). We use SSA data on all new DI beneficiaries between 2001
and 2007 and a Regression Kink Design (RKD) to exploit discontinuities in the formula relating
DI cash benefits to prior earnings (Nielsen, Sorensen and Taber 2010, Card, Lee, Pei and Weber
forthcoming). Monthly DI payments are based on a beneficiary’s Primary Insurance Amount
(PIA), which is a function of his or her Average Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIME), the average
of earnings in DI-covered employment over his or her highest-earning years. This formula is
progressive. Figure 1 shows that the marginal replacement rate decreases at two “bend points.”
Below a threshold level of AIME (called the “lower bend point”), the marginal replacement rate
is 90 percent; between this threshold and the next (called the “upper bend point”), the rate is 32
percent; and above the upper bend point, it is 15 percent. This RKD identification strategy is
novel in the DI context.
Prior research has established that DI receipt substantially reduces beneficiaries’ average
employment rates and earnings (e.g. Chen and van der Klaauw 2008, Maestas, Mullen and
Strand 2013, French and Song 2014, Autor, Maestas, Mullen and Strand 2015).2 Studies have
also shown that DI beneficiaries’ employment and earnings respond to DI work rules and the
structure of DI payments (e.g. Campolieti and Riddell 2012, Borghans, Gielen and Luttmer 2014,

This literature was influenced by the important study of Bound (1989), who found that at most half of DI
beneficiaries would work if they were not receiving benefits, as well as Parsons (1980).

Kostøl and Mogstad 2014). Other literature has shown that DI applications and labor force
participation are affected by labor market opportunities and DI eligibility rules (e.g. Gruber and
Kubik 1997, Gruber 2000, Black, Daniel, and Sanders 2002, Autor and Duggan 2003, Karlström,
Palme, and Svensson 2008, von Wachter, Manchester and Song 2011, Staubli 2011).3 It is
argued that the growth of DI has played a sizable role in the long-run U.S. trend toward
decreasing labor force participation (Parsons 1980, Autor and Duggan 2003). Across this
literature, decreases in work have often been interpreted as reflecting distortionary moral hazard;
for example, Gruber (2013) includes a section on “The Moral Hazard Effects of DI” (p. 406).
However, the effects of DI on work estimated in such studies may represent a
combination of income and substitution effects. DI creates income effects through the cash and
in-kind benefits provided by the program. On average, DI beneficiaries annually receive cash
payments of approximately $13,750 and Medicare benefits valued at approximately $7,200 (SSA
2013, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 2014).4 If leisure is a normal good, these
transfers should induce beneficiaries to work less. Substitution effects could arise because
earning above the Substantial Gainful Activity limit (SGA), which was $1,040 per month in
2013, can lead to losing DI benefits. This creates an incentive to earn below this level. Separate
substitution effects could occur because DI benefits are an increasing function of beneficiaries’
lifetime earnings (holding taxes constant).
The distinction between income and substitution effects can have important welfare
implications: if DI affects work through income rather than substitution effects, then in a
standard public finance analysis DI transfers would have no direct distortionary impact on work
because income effects simply represent a transfer of resources (Autor and Duggan 2007).5
Moreover, as with any public program, distinguishing income from substitution effects is crucial
for predicting the effects of DI policy reforms on work activity (Hoynes and Moffitt 1999). DI
reform proposals have often been focused on improving incentives to work, including U.S.
House of Representatives Committee of Ways and Means Chairman Paul Ryan’s recent proposal
to improve work (i.e. substitution) incentives within the Ticket to Work program.6 However,

Many individuals also increase their employment after being terminated from DI (Moore 2015). For a review of
earlier work on the impact of DI on work, see Bound and Burkhauser (1999).

We find the value of Medicare benefits by dividing total expenditures, minus the premiums paid by DI
beneficiaries, by the number of DI beneficiaries. Here and elsewhere, amounts are expressed in real 2013 dollars.

This assumes no pre-existing distortion. Of course, raising tax revenue to fund DI could lead to separate
distortions.

such a proposal would not increase earnings or participation to the extent that income effects
operate. On the other hand, the President’s Fiscal Year 2014 Budget proposal to use the chainweighted Consumer Price Index to calculate the DI Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA) would
slow the growth rate of DI benefit levels and therefore affect work decisions through an income
effect (Office of Management and Budget 2013). To predict the work impacts of such a policy, it
is necessary to estimate the income effect of DI.
The discontinuous change in the marginal replacement rate at the upper bend point allows
us to identify the effect of DI cash benefits on beneficiaries’ earnings, although interactions with
SSI and other program rules confound the analysis at the lower bend point. With a large sample
of 610,271 beneficiaries in the region of the upper bend point, we document a graphically clear,
substantial, and statistically robust effect of DI payments on average earnings. A clear increase in
the slope of mean earnings at the upper bend point arises for the first time in the year after
individuals go on DI and persists in subsequent years. In a baseline specification, the estimates
imply that if DI payments are increased by one dollar, beneficiaries decrease their earnings by 20
cents (p<0.01). Since mean earnings are low, this corresponds to a large elasticity of earnings
with respect to DI payments of -1.92. Our estimates directly answer the policy-relevant question
of how changes in benefit payment amounts affect earnings, which is relevant when predicting
the earnings effects of a proposal like the chain-weighted COLA. We interpret these results as
essentially reflecting only an income effect, because beneficiaries’ earnings are almost always
small relative to the SGA limit. We find no evidence that individuals sort around the bend point
prior to going on DI. Remarkably, our estimates are similar when we control for linear,
quadratic, or cubic functions of the assignment variable; to our knowledge, ours is the first RKD
study in which this has been shown. We also conduct several placebo analyses and other
robustness checks to verify that we have found a true effect on earnings, as opposed to an
underlying nonlinearity in earnings as a function of AIME.
Despite the importance of estimating the income effect of DI, it has been considered
difficult to do so. Autor and Duggan (2007) write: “The DI program has provided benefits
exclusively on a work-contingent basis, so income and substitution effects cannot readily be
separated” (p. 120). Our paper helps to fill this gap, complementing a small set of papers that
examine income effects in other disability contexts. Autor and Duggan (2007) and Autor,
Duggan, Greenberg and Lyle (2015) examine an income effect of changing access to Veterans’
Administration (VA) compensation for Vietnam War veterans on labor force participation,

employment and earnings.7 Marie and Vall Castello (2012) study the income effect of DI
benefits in Spain. Finally, Deshpande (2014) studies the effect of children’s SSI payments on
parents’ earnings. All of these studies find evidence consistent with substantial income effects in
these other contexts.8 Our paper is the first to estimate an income effect specifically in the
context of DI in the U.S., which is the largest U.S. federal expenditure on the disabled and one of
the largest social insurance programs in the U.S. and around the world.9
The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section II describes the policy
environment. Section III explains our identification strategy. Section IV describes the data.
Section V shows our analysis of income effects. Section VI explores evidence on the extent to
which income or substitution effects underlie earnings effects of DI. Section VII concludes. The
online appendix contains additional results.
II. Policy environment
DI insures workers for disabilities that are judged to prevent them from earning above
SGA. Once on DI, individuals can only work above SGA and retain DI eligibility when they are
participating in a Trial Work Period (TWP). A month becomes part of a TWP when monthly
earnings are above a level modestly lower than the SGA threshold; in 2013, it was $750.
Beneficiaries can complete up to nine months of Trial Work within a rolling 60-month period
without putting their DI eligibility at risk. Therefore, the SGA limit is binding only for
beneficiaries who have completed a TWP (“TWP completers”). For TWP completers, earning
above SGA leads to a review of whether the beneficiary is eligible to continue on DI. A review
may be triggered if beneficiaries report monthly earnings above SGA to SSA, or if their annual
earnings level reported on tax forms exceeds the annualized SGA limit, $12,480 per year (i.e. the
monthly limit of $1,040 multiplied by 12) (Schimmel and Stapleton 2011). A substantial
percentage of those reviewed are removed from DI; for example, in 2012, 43 percent of these
beneficiaries were terminated from the program (SSA 2014b). TWP completers accounted for
only 0.9 percent of DI beneficiaries in 2012 (SSA 2013). Among all DI beneficiaries, few have
high earnings or exit DI. For example, 0.4 percent of all DI beneficiaries had their eligibility
terminated because of substantial work in 2012 (SSA 2013). As DI beneficiaries typically have

Both studies estimate the reduced-form effects of receiving VA Disability Compensation. Autor et al. (2015)
conclude that “the effects that we estimate are unlikely to be driven solely by income effects” (p. 3).

little to no earnings, they could almost always greatly increase their earnings without triggering a
TWP or putting their DI eligibility at risk.
It is complex to calculate DI benefits. For DI beneficiaries who became eligible in 2013,
the PIA is calculated as: 90 percent of the first $791 of AIME, plus 32 percent of the next $3,977
of AIME, plus 15 percent of AIME over $4,768 (see Figure 1 and SSA 2013). Moreover,
calculating AIME requires inflating earnings in each of one’s highest-earning years by the
National Average Wage Index in each year.10 Typically, many years go into the AIME
calculation: in 2012, 65.5 percent of DI entrants were aged 50 years or older and thus have a
relevant earnings history that lasts 28 or more years (SSA 2013). After a beneficiary goes on DI,
DI benefits are determined by adjusting PIA through a COLA.
SSI and DI family payment rules can confound the relationship between AIME and
benefits received near the lower bend point. SSI provides cash payments and Medicaid to
disabled individuals who meet an asset test. In 2013, the federal SSI payment was $710 per
month (for those who do not work). Some individuals are dually eligible for both SSI and DI.
Dual-eligibles whose PIA is below the federal SSI payment are paid only the SSI payment, and
dual-eligibles whose PIA is above their SSI payment only receive DI benefits (after a waiting
period). The SSI payment of $710 is nearly identical to $712, the PIA at the lower bend point.
Thus, from below to above this bend point the slope of dual-eligibles’ net disability benefits
(summed over DI and SSI) as a function of AIME increases from zero to 32 percent. However,
potentially confounding policy changes occur for dual-eligibles near this bend point, including
moving from Medicaid benefits and a 50 percent cash benefit reduction rate in current earnings
(for those on SSI) to Medicare and no benefit reduction below SGA (for those on DI). Moreover,
around this bend point beneficiaries can choose outcomes like asset levels to gain eligibility for
the program that is more favorable to them, implying that dual eligibility could be endogenous.
Finally, for those who are not dual-eligible, the marginal replacement rate decreases at this bend
point from 90 percent to 32 percent. Appendix Figure A1 shows that near this bend point, around
seventy percent of DI recipients are dual-eligibles. Thus, over both dual-eligibles and non-dualeligibles, there is little average change in the slope of cash benefits summed across SSI and DI.
DI family payment rules also complicate measurement of the incentives near the lower
bend point.	  The maximum benefits that can be paid to the disabled worker plus their spouse and

children (the “family maximum”) is 85 percent of the worker's AIME, but by statute the family
maximum cannot be less than the PIA. The family maximum is equal to PIA below the lower
bend point, as PIA is 90 percent of AIME in this range. Once AIME reaches a slightly higher
level—$75 above the lower bend point—PIA exceeds 85 percent of AIME, so the family benefit
is capped at this level. This means that when considering total family DI payments, the marginal
replacement rate is 90 percent of AIME below the lower bend point, 32 percent for the next $75
of AIME, and 85 percent for the next $1,000 of AIME—suggesting that the reaction to the
changes in slope may be difficult to detect for this group. Moreover, near the lower bend point,
we cannot confidently identify whether a beneficiary has dependents, because the family
maximum creates an incentive to report dependents that varies around the lower bend point:
additional dependents lead to additional benefits above, but not below, the bend point.	  
Finally, only a small bandwidth can be used under the lower bend point because AIME is
close to zero. All of these factors suggest that a priori we do not expect to find meaningful
results at this bend point. By contrast, the SSI payment amount is far under PIA for beneficiaries
near the upper bend point, implying negligible scope for interaction between DI and SSI.
Moreover, only around 10 percent of DI claimants near the upper bend point are dual-eligible
(Appendix Figure A1). Finally, near the upper bend point, there is no discontinuous variation in
the rules for family DI benefits. Thus, we focus our analysis on the upper bend point.
III. Identification strategy
Card et al. (forthcoming) show that, under certain conditions, a change in treatment
intensity can identify local treatment effects by comparing the relative magnitudes of a kink in
the assignment variable and the induced kink in the outcome variable.11 This is known as an
RKD. Estimates can be interpreted as a treatment-on-the-treated parameter.
In our context, the treatment intensity is the size of DI benefits (i.e. PIA), and the
assignment variable is AIME when the individual first applies for DI. Our main outcome is mean
pre-tax earnings while on DI; this follows Saez (2010) and much subsequent public finance
literature using administrative datasets. As a function of AIME, the slope of DI payments
changes at the bend point, so we can estimate the causal effect of DI benefits on earnings by
comparing the change at the bend point in the slope of earnings to the change in the slope of PIA.
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
11

For clarity, note that “kink” is used both to describe the change in the PIA-AIME schedule at the bend points, and
the change in slope in the outcome variable around the bend points.

	  

6

	  
	  
	  
If higher benefits cause beneficiaries to earn less on average, then the slope of earnings should
increase at the bend point, corresponding to the decrease at the bend point in the slope of PIA.
Mathematically, we want to estimate the marginal effect of DI benefits (B) on earnings
(Y) or another measure of work activity. Benefits depend on AIME (A). Using the RKD, we can
estimate the effects around a given bend point A0 as:
∂E[Y|A = A0 ]
∂E[Y|A = A0 ]
    limA→A +0
−    limA→A −0

(1)

That is, our estimate of the marginal effect of DI benefits on earnings is the change at the bend
point in the slope of earnings divided by the change in the slope of benefits.
Identification of the effect of DI benefits on earnings relies on two key assumptions (Card
et al., forthcoming). First, in the neighborhood of the bend point, there is no discontinuity in the
slope of the direct effect of AIME on earnings.12 Second, conditional on unobservables, the
density of the assignment variable is smooth (i.e. continuously differentiable) in this
neighborhood. These assumptions may not hold if we observe sorting in relation to the bend
points, as indicated by a change at the bend point in the slope or level of the density of the
assignment variable, or by such a change in the distribution of predetermined covariates.
Our assignment variable is AIME from the year of applying for DI (“initial AIME”).
Because this is measured before individuals go on DI, it cannot be affected by earnings while on
DI. In our context, it would be surprising to observe notable sorting around the bend points prior
to going on DI. Calculating PIA on the basis of an individual’s earnings history is complex. This
implies that it is difficult for individuals to estimate precisely where their earnings history will
put them in relation to the bend points, especially as they are often unaware of relevant Social
Security rules (Liebman and Luttmer, 2015).13 Moreover, individuals would typically have to
change their earnings over long periods of time to change their AIME substantially. This is
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
12

For example, beneficiaries’ earnings could also be affected by other public programs, or by their marginal product
of labor (or hourly wages). We follow Saez (2010) and subsequent literature studying the effects of public programs
on earnings in assuming that these factors would jointly have a smooth effect earnings.
13
During our time period, most workers received a Social Security Statement that included an estimate of their PIA
if they applied for DI. This estimate could only provide a general idea of their likely benefits, however, as it does not
use information on the most recent 2 to 3 years of earnings and used strong assumptions to deal with this and other
information gaps (e.g., the Statement assumes the date of eligibility for DI is the current year, whereas in fact it can
be up to17 months before or 12 months after filing). The resulting measurement error implies that around the bend
points: (1) actual PIA should be a smooth function of PIA as estimated on the Statement; and (2) it should be
difficult to choose earnings to sort around the bend point on the basis of the information provided by the Statement.
This does not rule out that the Statement has some general effects on application behavior (Armour, 2013).

especially difficult for disabled workers, who typically experience decreasing earnings
trajectories in the years before applying for DI (von Wachter, Song and Manchester, 2011). A
year just prior to applying for DI would typically be among the lowest-earning years and would
therefore be excluded from the AIME calculation. 	  
The determination of PIA on the basis of AIME is deterministic; by law, the marginal
replacement rate changes around the bend points as described above. Accordingly, our main
specification uses a “sharp” RKD where we only need to estimate the numerator of (1), which is
the change in the slope of the conditional expectation of earnings at the bend point. If the
relationship between an outcome Y and AIME is linear, then we can estimate:
Yi = β 0 + β1 (Ai − A0 ) + β 2 (Ai − A0 )Di + ε i

(2)

where i indexes observations, Di = 1[A≥A0] is a dummy for being above the bend point, and the
change in the slope of the outcome at the bend point is β2. We limit the analysis to observations
for which |A-A0|≤h, where h is the bandwidth size. As in Card et al. (forthcoming), we test for a
change in slope by examining whether β2 is significantly different from zero. We follow Card et
al. (forthcoming) in using White robust standard errors.
Earnings while on DI are commonly zero, and their distribution is highly skewed; we
take the mean of the independent and dependent variables within each bin and run (2) using the
aggregated data, weighting each bin by its number of observations. Thus, in (2), i indexes bins.
By averaging data within each bin, we estimate standard errors that we view as conservative,
following one of Lee and Lemieux’s (2010) suggestions in the Regression Discontinuity context.
Our main bin size is $50, the largest size at which all dependent variables pass the two tests of
excess smoothing for Regression Discontinuity Designs recommended by Lee and Lemieux
(2010).14 Because our outcome is the average earnings over a given period, there is one
observation per bin and we do not need to address correlation of errors over time.15 We also
show the results when estimating our regressions at the individual level, or using other bin sizes.
Initial AIME is fixed. However, in certain cases AIME can change while a beneficiary is
on DI.16 The adjustments to AIME are typically minor, so initial AIME measures AIME in
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
14

We follow Landais (2014) in applying this to an RKD context.
Results are similar when we use observations for each separate year the outcome is observed, pool the years,
include time dummies, and cluster by bin.
16
First, the documented date of disability onset may change through the DI application and award process, thus
changing the years on which the AIME calculation is based. This accounts for more than 80 percent of adjustments
to AIME. Second, SSA observes earnings with a lag, so additional information on pre-DI earnings may be provided

subsequent years with only modest error. To account for AIME changes, we also estimate a
“fuzzy RKD,” where the “reduced form” model remains (2) but it is scaled by the “first stage”
estimates of the change in the slope of mean realized DI benefits while a beneficiary is on DI:

Benefitsi = α 0 + α 1 (Ai − A0 ) + α 2 (Ai − A0 )Di + ε i

(3)

The effect of a dollar of DI benefits on average earnings is then given by β2/α2. However, some
of the measured changes in AIME once on DI could be due to measurement error rather than true
changes, potentially leading to lack of precision in the first stage. In practice, AIME changes are
sufficiently minor that we obtain essentially identical results using the sharp and fuzzy RKD. We
use the sharp RKD as our baseline, while also showing the results using the fuzzy RKD.
Aspects of the econometric theory and empirical implementation of RKD have begun to
be explored only recently. One is the choice of bandwidth. At the upper bend point, we selected
$1,500 as our primary bandwidth, using the graphical patterns as a guide. We show the results
across a wide range of bandwidths, including the “data-driven” bandwidths selected by the
procedures of Calonico, Cattaneo and Titiunik (2014a, 2014b).
A second issue is how to control for the assignment variable. We call model (2) the
“linear” specification because the control for the assignment variable, (A-A0), is linear. Card et
al. (forthcoming) use linear and quadratic specifications. Calonico, Cattaneo and Titiunik
(2014a) propose an RKD estimator where a quadratic term in the assignment variable can be
used to correct the bias in the linear estimator. Ganong and Jaeger (2014) argue that cubic splines
perform better than other estimators. Our approach is to estimate versions of equation (2) with
linear, quadratic or cubic controls for the assignment variables.
A final set of issues is whether to allow for a discontinuity at the bend point in the level
of the outcome variable, or whether to control for covariates (Ando 2013). We try each option.
Thus, for each sample and outcome we will generally produce estimates using nine regressions:
the linear, quadratic and cubic regressions; a version of each allowing for a discontinuity in the
level of the outcome at the bend point; and a version of each including predetermined covariates.
Interpretation of the RKD estimates
As a benchmark, in Appendix 1 we present a standard lifecycle labor supply model. In
the lifecycle model, lifetime wealth affects earnings. Changes in DI payments around the bend
points lead to changes in beneficiaries’ lifetime wealth and therefore should influence earnings.
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
and change the AIME calculation. Third, beneficiaries may have sufficient earnings while on DI to have their AIME
updated; our tabulations show that in approximately five percent of cases, AIME is updated for this reason.

In this setting, it would be appropriate to calculate the effect of lifetime discounted DI transfer
income on earnings. Under the assumptions of Stone-Geary utility and no uncertainty as in
Imbens, Rubin, and Sacerdote (2001), we can express earnings in each year as a function of the
annual DI transfer payment, as we describe in the Appendix. We alternatively consider a static
framework in Appendix 1, which applies if individuals are myopic or liquidity constrained. In
this framework, earnings in a given year instead depend among other things on transfer income
in that year, which would motivate calculating the effect on yearly earnings of a marginal change
in contemporaneous yearly DI payments.17 Since we do not observe lifetime DI benefits, as a
baseline we express the effects as if they arise in the static model or in the Imbens, Rubin, and
Sacerdote (2001) framework.
Substitution incentives created by the SGA limit interact negligibly with the income
changes we are using, due to several factors. Changes in DI payments due to the change in the
replacement rate are small in the local region of the bend point. For example, for a beneficiary
whose AIME is $750 above the upper bend point (the midpoint of our baseline bandwidth above
the bend point), the change in the marginal replacement rate at the bend point from 0.32 to 0.15
reduces monthly DI income by only $127.5 (relative to having a marginal replacement rate of
0.32 above the bend point).18 Nearly all DI recipients have low or no earnings, and only a very
small fraction are earning near the SGA limit, implying extremely limited scope for this change –
equal to less than one-eighth of SGA – to push desired earnings above SGA. Moreover,
beneficiaries can earn over SGA during a TWP without putting their DI eligibility at risk, and the
SGA limit binds for only a small fraction – in our sample, only 1.8 percent – of beneficiaries
who have completed a TWP. Even among those who have completed a TWP, for whom SGA is
binding, we find that many beneficiaries locate above SGA (Appendix Figure A2).19 Thus, to a
first approximation we interpret our estimates as representing only an income effect.
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
17

PIA and AIME are monthly measures, and earnings are measured annually. Since the assignment variable is in
monthly terms we express earnings in monthly terms by dividing annual earnings by 12. Our regression estimates
refer to the additional average earnings over a given time period caused by $1 less in DI over the same time period.
18
Here -$127.5=$750*-0.17; the change in marginal replacement rate is -17 percentage points (=32 minus 15).
19
Appendix Figure A2 also shows little evidence for “bunching” in earnings just below SGA, consistent with the
conclusions of Schimmel, Stapleton, and Song (2011). The interpretation of these findings is complicated by the fact
that, as in previous literature on earnings around the SGA limit (e.g. Gubits et al. 2014, Wittenburg et al. 2015), we
only observe annual earnings, whereas the SGA limit applies monthly. Despite this limitation, note that we still can
correctly infer that TWP completers with annual earnings above the annualized SGA limit must be in violation of a
monthly SGA limit: if one exceeds the annualized SGA limit, then one must be exceeding the monthly SGA limit in
at least one month of the year. Moreover, for the substantial fraction of the population that earns the same amount in
every month of the year—46.91 percent in the Survey of Income and Program Participation in 2001 to 2007, which

	  
	  

10

	  
	  
	  
Importantly, if hypothetically the SGA limit constrains beneficiaries from increasing their
earnings as much as they would in the absence of the limit, then our estimates should reflect a
lower bound on the income effect.20 Equally important, regardless of their interpretation, our
estimates directly answer the policy-relevant question of how changes in benefit payment
amounts affect earnings (without changing substitution incentives at the same time). Thus, the
estimates are relevant to estimating the actual effects of proposed policy changes to DI benefit
levels (holding substitution incentives as they are in existing policy).
Beneficiaries often are not aware of Social Security rules, and our RKD strategy does not
necessarily assume that beneficiaries are aware of the kink in benefits at the bend points. We
could observe a response because beneficiaries are reacting, for example, to the amount of DI
payments they are receiving, or to their total income, which could be much more salient.
Our estimates represent the effects of changing DI benefit payments while holding other
factors constant. Like other papers based on local variation, including others in the DI literature,
our identification strategy does not attempt to estimate general equilibrium impacts of DI.
IV. Data
We use SSA data from the 2010 Disability Analysis File (DAF), a compilation of
multiple SSA data sources, including the Master Beneficiary Record, Supplemental Security
Record, 831 File, Numident File, and Disability Control File. The DAF contains information on
all disability beneficiaries who received at least one month of benefits between 1997 and 2010,
and follows outcomes through 2011. It has information on each beneficiary’s PIA and AIME;
demographics like age, race, and gender; path to DI allowance (e.g. whether a claimant was
determined eligible by the initial disability examiner or through a hearings-level appeal decided
by an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ)); the magnitude of disability payments; and DI program
outcomes (e.g. whether suspended or terminated for working) (Hildebrand et al., 2012). The data
do not contain information on assets, total unearned income from other sources, or hours worked.
Annual taxable W-2 wage earnings through 2011 are obtained by linking to the Detailed
Earnings Record (DER). W-2s are mandatory tax returns filed by employers for each employee
for whom the firm withholds taxes and/or to whom remuneration exceeds a modest threshold.
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
provides an illustrative benchmark—bunching below the monthly SGA limit should entail bunching below the
annualized SGA limit.
20
In principle, a cut in benefits in the presence of the SGA limit could lead an individual to move from earning
below SGA to earning well above SGA and exiting DI, where another budget set tangency could lie. In this case, our
income effect estimates could be larger than those in the absence of SGA. However, as we show, only a negligibly
small fraction of beneficiaries earn well above SGA and exit DI.

	  

11

	  
	  
	  
Our measure of earnings excludes self-employment earnings, as this can often be subject to
manipulation (e.g. Chetty, Friedman, and Saez 2013); Current Population Survey statistics
indicate that only 1.92 percent of the disabled are self-employed.
We use a sample that entered DI between 2001 and 2007 and were aged 21 to 61 years at
the time of applying. We choose these years because the rules related to SGA and DI work
activity were consistent throughout (after changes in 2000). The restriction to those under 61
avoids interactions with Old Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) Social Security rules. To focus
on beneficiaries whose DI payments are affected by the bend points, we also limit the baseline
sample to DI claimants who did not receive SSI at any point in the sample period and who are
primary beneficiaries. Following Maestas, Mullen and Strand (2013), the data allow us to
examine the four years after DI allowance for each entering DI cohort, meaning the four calendar
years beginning with the first full calendar year in which recipients received DI payments (e.g.
from 2008 to 2011 for the 2007 cohort). Thus, we examine earnings close to when beneficiaries
first receive DI and after they have had time to adjust to DI payments and rules.
We clean the data by removing records with missing or imputed observations of basic
demographic information (e.g. date of birth), which reduces the sample by 2.0 percent. We also
remove records in which there is no initial AIME or PIA value, or in which the stated date of
disability onset used for the PIA calculation is outside the range over which the date of disability
onset should lie (i.e. more than 17 months before or 12 months after the date of filing). This
reduces the sample by another 5.5 percent. In addition, we remove beneficiaries who have a PIA
based on eligibility for DI under both their record and that of another worker (since total DI
benefits may not be a function of one’s own AIME in this group), or who had not received DI
payments within four years of filing, reducing the sample by another 1.5 percent. We also
remove those who died in the years after entering DI, which removes another 14 percent. We
eliminate cases in which the data contain unreliable measures of AIME by discarding those with
more than four AIME changes, which removes 0.9 percent. These sample restrictions are similar
to those generally made when using these data (e.g., von Wachter, Song and Manchester 2011,
Maestas, Mullen and Strand 2013, Moore 2015).
PIA is measured in pre-tax terms. By examining the effect of pre-tax benefits, we answer
the policy-relevant question of how a given cut in benefits paid by SSA would affect earnings.
Marital status and total family taxable income are not available in our data, preventing us from
measuring the relevant tax rate. After-tax benefits are slightly smaller than pre-tax benefits—and
	  

12

	  
	  
	  
the marginal replacement rate associated with after-tax benefits should change at the bend point
by slightly less—suggesting that our point estimate of the effect of pre-tax benefits should reflect
a lower bound on the effect of after-tax benefits. Appendix Figure A3 shows that measured (pretax) PIA in the data changes slope at the bend points in the way the policy dictates.
Table 1 shows summary statistics. We use 610,271 observations around the upper bend
point, i.e. those for whom initial AIME is within $1,500 of the bend point. Average monthly PIA
is $1,773, implying annualized benefits of $21,276. Over the four years before applying for DI,
average annual earnings decline from $48,895 to $36,680. Post-award earnings are dramatically
lower than pre-application earnings on average: earnings in the four years after first receiving DI
are around $2,500 per year. Average annual DI payments are nearly ten times larger than annual
earnings. In each of these years, one-fifth to one-quarter of the sample has positive earnings.
Average age when applying is 49.8, and 69 percent of the sample is male. Only 0.7 percent of the
sample is suspended due to earning above SGA, and only 0.1 percent is terminated from DI.
Since our identification strategy examines earnings patterns around the upper bend point,
which is the 82nd percentile of AIME, the estimates will be local to this region. However, the full
sample (including those not near the bend points) is similar along most dimensions to those near
the upper bend point, except that the upper bend point sample has a higher mean PIA, higher
mean pre-DI earnings, and is somewhat more often male. Additionally, the sample around the
upper bend point spans from the 59th percentile of AIME to the 95th percentile and represents a
substantial fraction of beneficiaries (Appendix Figure A4).
V. Graphical and Regression Analysis of Income Effects
V.a. Preliminary analysis
We begin with validity checks on the empirical method. Figure 2 shows that the number
of observations and its slope appear continuous around the upper bend point. Appendix Figure
A5 shows that the distribution of six predetermined covariates available in the administrative
data—fraction male, average age when applying for DI, fraction black, fraction allowed via
hearing, fraction whose disability is a mental disorder, and fraction whose disability is a
musculoskeletal condition—appears smooth through the bend point. Table 2 confirms that the
number of observations, these predetermined covariates, and the fraction of the sample on SSI
(prior to their exclusion) are all smooth through bend point. Similarly to Card et al.
(forthcoming) and Turner (2014), for each of these dependent variables separately, we examine
the coefficient β2 when we run regressions with polynomials in AIME of each order between
	  

13

	  
	  
	  
three and 12. For each dependent variable, we report β2 for the polynomial order that minimizes
the finite-sample corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc). Using a baseline specification
without additional controls and with no discontinuity in the dependent variable at the bend point,
none of the specifications shows that β2 is statistically different from zero at the five percent
level. Moreover, these regressions are rarely statistically significant for any polynomial order.
We can also examine whether “bunching” occurs in the density of initial AIME around
the convex kink in the budget set created by the reduction in the marginal replacement rate
around a bend point, because earning an extra dollar that increases AIME leads to a greater
increase in DI benefits below the bend point than above it.21 As described in Appendix 2,
standard theory shows that if beneficiaries respond to the incentives this creates before going on
DI, then initial AIME should “bunch” around the bend point because the smaller marginal
replacement rate above the bend point makes it less worthwhile to earn more than below the
bend point (e.g. Hausman 1981).
Following Saez (2010), we estimate the extent of such bunching by fitting a smooth
polynomial to the earnings density away from the kink and estimating the “excess mass” that
occurs above this smooth polynomial in the region of the kink. Specifically, for each earnings
bin zi of width k we calculate pi, the proportion of the sample with earnings in the range
[zi-k/2,zi+k/2). The earnings bins are normalized by the distance the bend point, so that for zi=0,
pi is the fraction of people with earnings in the range [0,k). We run the following regression:
pi = ∑ d=0 β d (zi )d + ∑ j=− k γ 1{zi = j} +ε i
D

k

(4)

This expresses the earnings distribution as a degree D polynomial, plus indicators for each bin
within kδ of the kink, where δ is the bin width. Using the bandwidth of $1,500, in model (4) we
estimate the coefficient γ on a dummy for having final AIME within $100 of the kink, while
controlling for a baseline seventh-degree polynomial through the density of AIME (following
Chetty, Friedman, Olsen, and Pistaferri 2011). γ reflects the excess density near the kink.
Table 3 shows that the resulting estimates of γ are precise, insignificant and very small.
For example, in the baseline the mean density in the two bins surrounding the excluded region is

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
21

Working more will not lead to higher DI income if earnings are not in the highest-earning years used to calculate
AIME. However, as long as the prevalence of such cases evolves smoothly through the bend point (consistent with
our data), the substitution effect should still lead to a greater incentive to earn below each bend point than above it.

	  

14

	  
	  
	  
895 times larger than γ.22 These conclusions hold through variations on the baseline estimates:
controlling for covariates; using an alternative bandwidth; controlling for an eighth-degree
polynomial; and defining the kink as a larger region around the bend point. Consistent with the
exposition of the models in Appendix 1, this finding could reflect that future DI claimants do not
anticipate or understand the DI income they will receive or that they do not react to the
substitution incentives even when correctly anticipating them.23
V.b. Main Results
Figure 3 shows average earnings in the four years after DI allowance around the upper
bend point. As we would expect if DI payments reduce earnings, the slope clearly increases at
the upper bend point and the empirical observations lie close to the fitted lines.
Table 4 shows the estimated earnings effects when we implement the nine regression
specifications described earlier. We report the implied effect on earnings of increasing DI
benefits by one dollar, under the sharp RKD assumption that the marginal replacement rate
changes from 0.32 to 0.17 at the upper bend point. (Appendix Table A2 shows the actual
regression estimates we use to generate the implied effects in Table 4.) In our baseline
specification, increasing DI benefits by one dollar leads to a substantial decrease in earnings of
20.28 cents at the upper bend point (p<0.01). As the marginal replacement rate falls at the bend
point, this is consistent with the graphical evidence showing an increase at the bend point in the
slope of average earnings as a function of AIME. Mean earnings are low, so the implied
elasticity of earnings with respect to DI benefits, -1.92, is large.
The estimates are similar when we allow for a discontinuity at the bend point (Column 2)
and when controlling for predetermined covariates (Column 3). The estimates are modestly
larger under the quadratic and cubic specifications in Columns 4 to 6 and 7 to 9, respectively.
Across all nine specifications, the point estimates are relatively stable and range from -19.25 to
-27.38 cents (p<0.01 in all nine cases). It is striking that the estimates are so robust when we
control for linear, quadratic, or cubic functions of the assignment variable. In other RKD
contexts surveyed in Ganong and Jaeger (2014), nearly all studies control for only linear and/or
quadratic functions of the assignment variable (although it is possible the results in some of these
studies would be robust to controlling for a cubic function). The linear specification without
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
22

In Appendix Table A1, we also test for a discontinuity in the level of the number of observations and find no
significant discontinuity across any of the specifications at the upper bend point.
23
In the context of bunching in initial AIME, it is not straightforward to translate γ into a substitution elasticity as in
Saez (2010), because it is unknown when individuals anticipate going on DI.

	  

15

	  
	  
	  
additional controls minimizes the AICc, so we focus on this specification as a baseline. Table 4
also shows that the estimates are remarkably stable across individual years, with baseline
estimates that range between -18.29 cents in the third year and -23.02 cents in the first year.
Within each year, the estimates are generally stable across all nine specifications.
The paper’s main finding—which holds no matter how the income effect is scaled—is
that there is a clear, robust, and substantial income effect. We could alternatively express our
estimates as the effect of lifetime benefits on monthly earnings. Although we do not observe
lifetime benefits, we can make assumptions to get a sense of the order of magnitude. A claimant
typically collects DI benefits until becoming eligible for OASI benefits, which are essentially
equal to DI benefits and are generally collected until death. Mean life expectancy when initially
receiving DI is 20.31 years.24 We discount benefits at a real rate of three percent as an
illustration. Over the 20.31 years, the discounted sum of a dollar in benefits each year is $15.04.
Thus, our baseline point estimate suggests that an increase in lifetime OASDI benefits of $1 is
associated with a decrease in annual earnings around 1.35 cents (= -20.28/15.04).25
In Figure 4, we show the graph at the upper bend point without fitted lines, both in a
“placebo” period prior to applying for DI and in the period after receiving DI. We consider this
figure our clearest visual evidence that earnings while on DI are causally affected by DI
payments. In each of the four years prior to applying for DI (panels A, B, C, and D), average
earnings appears to be close to a linear function of AIME, with essentially identical slope on
both sides of the bend point. Appendix Table A5 confirms that when the outcome is earnings in
the four years prior to applying for DI, the estimates are unstable, generally insignificant and
imply only a tiny percentage change in slope. The AICc-minimizing specifications all show
negative and insignificant estimates. Strikingly, in each of the four years subsequent to receiving
DI, there is a sharp increase in slope precisely at the bend point (panels E, F, G, and H), lending
credibility to our results because this kink in earnings arises precisely after individuals go on
DI.26
Thus, beneficiaries’ earnings respond to the transfers after they go on DI, but not before.
In the lifecycle model in Appendix 1, if these transfers are anticipated in advance, there should
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
24

To calculate mean life expectancy we compute the weighted average of life expectancy for each gender from
Zayatz (2011), using as weights the fraction of each gender in the region of the bend point (shown in Table 1).
25
Of course, if the earnings impact were sustained over all 20.31 years, this would imply that a $1 increase in
lifetime discounted OASDI benefits is associated with a decrease in lifetime discounted earnings of 20.28 cents.
26
We show these graphs without drawn lines and with larger bins to show the variation in each year as clearly as
possible. Appendix Figure A6 shows these results under the same formatting as our other graphs.

	  

16

	  
	  
	  
be no such change. The evidence is therefore consistent with a number of possibilities. In a
lifecycle model, the income effects we document could be associated with changes in transfer
income that beneficiaries do not anticipate prior to going on DI (perhaps because they do not
know about the magnitude of the income they will receive), which is also consistent with the
lack of bunching in initial AIME at the bend point. In principle, it is also possible that the effects
of DI income on earnings operate through liquidity effects (as in Chetty 2008). In our context, DI
beneficiaries normally should not expect an increase in future income and therefore typically
should not want to borrow in a standard lifecycle model, limiting the scope for liquidity effects.27
It is also possible that beneficiaries behave myopically, effectively treating each period’s
earnings decision as static—consistent with how we express the income effects.
Figure 5 shows the extensive margin, i.e. the fraction of the four years with positive
annual earnings. There is an apparent increase in slope around the bend point. The regression
analysis in Table 5 shows substantial effects in the linear specifications: a $1,000 increase in
annual DI benefits is estimated to decrease the probability of reporting positive annual earnings
by 1.29 percentage point (p<0.01) in the specification without controls. As only a modest
fraction of the sample has positive earnings in any given year, it makes sense that part of the
observed earnings response would be operating through the extensive margin. Though these
estimates remain positive under the quadratic and cubic specifications, they are smaller and lose
statistical significance. We obtain comparable results under specifications with the log odds of
participation as the dependent variable. We conclude that there is some visual and statistical
evidence of a participation effect at the upper bend point.28
We show the main components of the analysis for the lower bend point in Appendix
Tables A1, A3, and A4, and Appendix Figures A1 and A3 through A9. The main results at the
lower bend point show no significant effects on earnings in any of the nine specifications.
However, given the a priori reasons above that we would not expect to find a meaningful change
in slope at the lower bend point even if there is an income effect on earnings there, this evidence
does not lead us to conclude that there is no income effect the lower bend point.

As we do not have data on assets or consumption, it is not possible to estimate such effects more directly. Even if
we did have data on assets, note that conditional on locating near the bend point, differences in assets should largely
be driven by savings preferences, which could be correlated with other determinants of the size of income effects.
28
If DI benefits affect employment, then it is hard to interpret estimates of how DI payments affect earnings that are
conditional on employment, as the sample is selected on an outcome (i.e. a beneficiary having positive earnings).
The point estimates suggest insignificant negative impacts of DI benefits on earnings conditional on employment.

the lower bend point are shown for the group of non-dual-eligibles alone, although the results are
similar when including (or focusing only on) dual-eligibles.
V.c. Robustness checks and other outcomes
Several exercises further establish the robustness of the earnings estimates. Figure 6
shows how the baseline specification estimate varies over bandwidths between $500 and $2,000.
The point estimate remains between -17 and -27 cents throughout. The estimates are significant
at 5 percent nearly throughout the range of bandwidths. They turn insignificant only when the
bandwidth is smaller than $550, which is not surprising as the smaller sample size leads to less
statistical power. The bandwidth selection procedure of Calonico, Cattaneo, and Titiunik (2014a,
2014b) shows an optimal bandwidth of approximately $650.29 The point estimate at this
bandwidth is -19.80 cents (p<0.01), nearly identical to the baseline.
Ganong and Jaeger (2014) suggest assessing whether the coefficient estimate is larger
than those at “placebo” kinks placed away from the true kink. Figure 7 shows the point estimate
and 95 percent confidence interval when we run regression (2) for “placebo” kinks placed in $50
increments from $1,450 below to $1,450 above the true location of the upper bend point.
Reassuringly, the absolute value of the coefficient is maximized at the location of the actual bend
point. It is not surprising that we still estimate a negative, though notably smaller, effect when
the placebo bend point is placed somewhat away from the actual bend point, as the change in
slope at the actual bend point should drive a negative, though smaller, estimate of the change in
slope at nearby placebo bend points. The formal “permutation test” following Ganong and Jaeger
(2014) shows that the estimate with the kink placed at the actual bend point is statistically
significantly larger in magnitude than the distribution of placebo estimates (p<0.05).30 When
earnings in the four years before applying for DI is the dependent variable, the permutation test
reassuringly shows insignificant effects of DI payments in all nine specifications (p>0.40
throughout).

We implement a local linear RKD specification with bias correction using the local quadratic estimator and
uniform weighting. We set the Imbens-Kalyanaraman regularization value to zero, which is consistent with finding
the optimal bandwidth in the RKD context (Card et al. forthcoming, Calonico, Cattaneo and Titiunik, 2014b).
30
When using placebo kinks farther from the bend point, or estimating the bandwidth based on the Calonico et al.
procedure separately at each placebo kink, we also estimate p<0.05. Additionally, following Landais (2014), in
Appendix Figure A10 we show the R-squared of the baseline model when the kink is placed at “placebo” locations.
The R-squared is maximized close to the actual bend point, again suggesting that we are estimating a true effect on
earnings. See also Manoli and Turner (2014).

	  

18

	  
	  
	  
We next assess the estimates under two sample changes. First, Table 6 shows that when
including SSI recipients in the sample, the results are nearly identical to the baseline. Second,
disabled workers’ dependents can also receive benefits. Near the upper bend point, the total DI
benefits payable to a worker and his or her dependents is capped at 150 percent of PIA. For those
whose dependents are receiving benefits (32.95 percent of the sample), at the family level the
marginal replacement rate therefore changes at the bend point from up to 48 (=32*1.5) to up to
22.5 (=15*1.5) percent. As a baseline, we measure the marginal replacement rate only for the
primary beneficiary, i.e. we express effects as if the marginal replacement rate changes from 32
to 15 percent. This effectively corresponds to an extreme case in which primary beneficiaries’
earnings are not influenced by their dependents’ DI benefits. An alternative assumption is a
“unitary” model of the family, in which the family acts as if it maximizes a single utility function
and therefore pools the unearned income of all family members (Becker 1976). In this case, the
change in marginal replacement rates for those with dependents is up to 50 percent larger. (Our
data extract does not have information on total DI benefits paid to all dependents, so we cannot
calculate the family’s exact marginal replacement rate.) Thus, our estimates of the effect of a
dollar of benefits on earnings would be up to 16.48 percent (=32.95 percent x 50 percent) smaller
if dependent benefits were taken into account. Although we quote the crowdout estimate based
on the primary beneficiary’s benefit alone as a benchmark, this effectively serves as shorthand
for recognizing that in a “unitary” setting the crowdout estimates could be up to 16.48 percent
smaller. To show a sample where this is not an issue, in Table 6 we try dropping beneficiaries
whose dependents are receiving payments. Again, the results are nearly identical to the baseline.
Table 6 also shows that the fuzzy RKD gives nearly identical results to the basic sharp
RKD results. This is because the first stage estimate is extremely close to the -0.17 change in the
marginal replacement rate at the bend point assumed in the sharp RKD; for example, in the
baseline specification, the fuzzy RKD first stage coefficient is -0.167 (standard error 0.0039).
Appendix Table A6 displays regressions using $25-wide or $100-wide bins, and
alternatively using the individual-level data (rather than collapsing to the bin level). It also shows
the results when we include beneficiaries whose AIME changes more than four times. All of
these exercises produce results that are similar to our baseline.
Appendix Figure A11 shows other work-related outcomes in the four years after going on
DI: the fraction suspended for work, the fraction terminated for work, and the average DI
payments foregone due to beneficiaries working. Each of these outcomes occurs for only a small
	  

19

	  
	  
	  
fraction of the sample. None of the figures displays a clear change in slope at the bend point.
Appendix Table A7 confirms that there are no robustly significant effects on these outcomes.
In Section V, we found no evidence that prior to going on DI individuals respond to the
substitution incentive created by the convex kink associated with the change in the marginal
replacement rate at the bend point. If this substitution incentive affects earnings after going on
DI, then again we would expect to find “bunching” in the earnings distribution at the bend point
once beneficiaries have received DI for some time. However, we find no such pattern in
Appendix Figure A12. The regressions in Appendix Table A8 show a negligible coefficient γ on
the dummy for having final AIME near the bend point from specification (4) using the same
specification and throughout the same robustness checks as Table 3. It may be unsurprising that
we find no evidence of a substitution effect in the context of the convex kink at the bend point,
given: (a) the complexity of understanding the linkage between current earnings and future DI
benefits; and (b) the fact that earnings after going on DI are sufficiently high to change AIME in
only around five percent of cases.
V.d. Effect heterogeneity
Table 7 shows the earnings effects at the upper bend point across subgroups. We report
estimates from the baseline linear specification, which minimizes the AICc for all subgroups
except beneficiaries whose primary disability is cancer. The effect is substantially larger for
women than for men, although the elasticity is modestly higher for males (as women have higher
average earnings in our sample). The effect is also substantially larger for those under 45 than for
those over 45, although the elasticity is modestly higher in the older group. The effect is
modestly larger for those allowed DI eligibility by their initial DI examiner than for those
allowed by a ALJ via a hearing after an initial denial, but the elasticity is modestly higher for
those allowed by an ALJ. The estimates are similar for black and non-black beneficiaries. The
effects are largest for those diagnosed with circulatory conditions, followed by mental disorders,
neurological conditions, injuries, “other” disabilities, respiratory conditions, and musculoskeletal
conditions, and the elasticities generally follow similar patterns. The estimate for those with
cancer is only barely above zero and insignificant (and remains so in its AICc-minimizing
specification). At the extensive margin, the point estimates also generally follow similar patterns
across groups (throughout the nine specifications).
As our estimates are local to the upper bend point, it is not possible to determine directly
whether the results generalize to the full population of DI recipients. However, the results are
	  

20

	  
	  
	  
comparable to the baseline when we re-weight the population so that its demographic
characteristics—other than AIME, which we cannot re-weight because we only observe a
specific income range around the upper bend point—match those of the full sample. This is not
surprising, as we estimate significant and substantial effects in each group separately. For
example, the main demographic characteristic that differs in the upper bend point sample is
fraction male; when we re-weight so that the percent male matches the percentage in the full
sample of DI beneficiaries (i.e. 52 percent in the full sample, rather than 69 percent around the
upper bend point), the crowdout point estimate, -28.91 cents (p<0.01), is modestly larger.
VII. Conclusion
A key open policy question is the size of DI’s income effects on earnings. Our main
finding is that a $1 increase in yearly DI benefits causes a decrease in yearly earnings around 20
cents around the upper bend point. This could reflect a lower bound in three senses, reinforcing
our primary conclusion that income effects are substantial: in some specifications the point
estimates are larger (up to -28 cents); the SGA limit could constrain larger responses; and the
per-dollar crowdout caused by after-tax benefits should be modestly larger than the effects of
pre-tax benefits that we measure. In previous literature the impact of DI on earnings has often
been interpreted as reflecting moral hazard, but our results clearly demonstrate that this earnings
crowdout does not only reflect moral hazard.
As a benchmark to assess the size of our estimates, it is informative to compare our
estimates to Maestas, Mullen, and Strand (2013, henceforth “MMS”) and French and Song
(2014, henceforth “FS”). MMS use random assignment to DI examiners and FS use “essentially”
random assignment to DI ALJs to examine the overall effects of DI receipt on earnings and
employment. We compare our results primarily to MMS and FS because, like us, they examine
the U.S. DI program in a similar time period (in the 2000s and the 1990s and 2000s,
respectively), and because they use random or essentially random assignment. The MMS
estimates apply to DI beneficiaries allowed by DI examiners, while the FS estimates apply to DI
beneficiaries allowed by ALJs; we use both types of DI beneficiaries and similar data in our
study, albeit from slightly different periods of time. MMS and FS find that DI receipt causes
average annual earnings losses (including both intensive and extensive margin effects) of $3,781
and $4,059, respectively, corresponding to earnings crowdout of 18 and 19 cents per dollar of DI
benefits, respectively. These crowdout estimates are close to—and insignificantly different
from—our baseline estimate of 20 cents, suggesting that the income effect we estimate
	  

21

	  
	  
	  
encompasses essentially all of the earnings crowdout they find.31 Moreover, when investigating
populations more comparable to MMS and FS separately, we continue to find similar results: in
Table 7 we find income effects of 23 cents per dollar of DI benefits among those made eligible
by the DI examiner (most comparable to the MMS population), and 15 cents among those made
eligible by an ALJ (most comparable to FS). When comparing to other literature cited in the
Introduction, which typically investigates contexts less similar to ours, again our estimated
income effect encompasses a large portion of the overall effects they estimate.32
Our results show substantial income effects at the upper bend point. Across groups based
on prior income, MMS find the smallest effects in the top quintile, and they find effects in the
fourth quintile that are close to the population average. These quintiles are the most comparable
to our sample around the upper bend point, which ranges from the 59th to 95th percentile of
earnings. If anything, this suggests—though does not imply—that crowdout could be similar or
larger in other parts of the distribution of prior earnings.33
Autor and Duggan (2007) point out that nearly all attempts by SSA to increase the labor
supply of DI beneficiaries, such as the Ticket to Work program, have primarily changed
substitution incentives. One explanation for the apparent lack of success of these programs,
despite the substantial work effects of DI documented in previous studies, is that DI’s income
effects are very important, whereas its substitution effects could be small enough that Ticket to
Work had little impact. Thus, our results showing strong income effects could suggest an
explanation for existing patterns in the data—such as the lack of a meaningful increase in
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
31

MMS and FS find that DI receipt reduces the probability of employment by 28 and 26 percentage points,
respectively, or 1.22 and 1.11 percentage points per $1,000 of DI benefits, respectively. Again, these are close to our
extensive margin income effect estimates of 1.29 percentage points per $1,000 of DI benefits in the linear
specification. At the same time, these are around three times larger than the point estimates from our other extensive
margin specifications, so it is possible that income effects encompass a smaller (but likely still substantial) portion
of the extensive margin effect. Thus, our main conclusion here is that our estimates of earnings crowdout encompass
a large fraction of the earnings crowdout in these studies.
32
Under alternative assumptions, the income effect estimates from our study continue to be in the same range as the
overall crowdout in MMS and FS. First, our largest crowdout estimate, 27 cents per dollar of DI benefits, is also in
the same range as—and insignificantly different from—theirs. Second, FS estimate that DI receipt reduces earnings
by $4,915 after five years (rather than their baseline three-year horizon), corresponding to a crowdout estimate of 23
cents per dollar of DI benefits. Third, above we calculated the crowdout from these studies by including the average
value of Medicare benefits, $7,200 per year, in the value of DI. If instead we exclude the value of Medicare
benefits—relevant in the extreme case that receipt of these benefits does not influence DI beneficiaries’ earnings—
MMS’s and FS’s baseline results imply earnings crowdout of 27 and 30 cents per dollar of DI benefits, respectively.
33
MMS’s heterogeneity analysis examines extensive margin effects, not earnings, but their large extensive margin
effects suggest that a large part of their earnings effects could operate through the extensive margin. Across other
subgroups like type of disability, our estimates tend to be larger in subgroups where MMS found larger effects.
French and Song (2014) examine groups based on income closer to DI receipt but do not break down by AIME.

	  

22

	  
	  
	  
workforce integration of DI recipients following the passage of Ticket to Work in 1999—and
could help to predict the effects of proposed DI reforms.
For example, if earnings crowdout is 20 cents on the dollar more broadly, this would
have implications for the earnings and fiscal consequences of a change in DI benefits, such as the
chain-weighting proposal in the President’s Fiscal Year 2014 Budget. Chain-weighting would
cut DI cash benefits by around three percent for someone who had been on the program for 10
years; for an average beneficiary near the upper bend point in our sample, this would mean an
annual benefit cut of $638. Our estimates suggest this would cause an increase in mean annual
earnings around $128. Assume, for illustration, that the marginal tax rate on earnings is 0.25
(including both federal payroll and income taxes), and assume the typical case that DI benefits
are not taxed. In this case, a $1 cut in DI benefits would increase total federal government
revenue by five cents; the Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance Trust Fund alone would
gain $2.48 cents in revenue; and the DI Trust Fund alone would gain $0.36 cents.34 If chainweighting decreases annual benefits by $638, this would lead to an annual increase in federal
government revenues around $32, an increase in OASDI revenues around $16, and an increase in
DI revenues of over $2. Such fiscal consequences are relevant as policy-makers consider steps
that would affect the finances of the DI Trust Fund, which is projected to be exhausted in 2022
(Social Security Administration 2015).
Labor economists typically agree that the uncompensated elasticity of labor supply with
respect to a large, permanent change in wages is small, but the relative roles of income and
substitution effects are less clear (Kimball and Shapiro 2008). In comparison with other evidence
on income effects, our estimates are modestly larger than crowdout estimates based on lotteries,
which are in the range of 5 to 10 cents on the dollar (e.g. Imbens, Rubin, and Sacerdote 2001;
Cesarini, Lindqvist, Notowidigdo, and Östling 2014), but smaller than some estimates in the
context of retirement pensions (e.g. Costa 1995). In non-DI disability contexts, Autor, Duggan,
Greenberg, and Lyle (2015) estimate that VA Disability Compensation eligibility reduced labor
force participation by 18 percentage points. Marie and Vall Castello (2012) find an elasticity of
labor force participation with respect to DI generosity of 0.22 in Spain, while our earnings
crowdout estimates are smaller than the SSI children’s program estimates of Deshpande (2014).
All of these studies examine different contexts than ours, and there is no reason that Social
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
34

$1.05 is calculated as: $1 in benefits plus $0.05 in reduced taxes (=$0.20 multiplied by a 25 percent marginal tax
rate). The other revenue impacts are calculated analogously.

	  

23

	  
	  
	  
Security disability should have the same income effects on earnings as other disability programs.
Thus, we view our findings as compatible with theirs. Indeed, our goal is to estimate income
effects specifically in the largest disability program, DI, and one of the largest existing social
insurance programs.
Although our results are relevant to understanding the effects of the DI program,
performing a full welfare analysis of DI would require estimates of many parameters and is
beyond the scope of this paper (Diamond and Sheshinski 1995, Meyer and Mok 2013).
Nonetheless, the estimates in our paper could provide some of the building blocks for such an
analysis. As noted, standard public finance analysis suggests that only substitution, not income,
effects lead to distortions (in the absence of a pre-existing distortion). Of course, DI is financed
through taxation, which can cause deadweight loss through this separate channel. Future work
could more formally consider the implications of our estimates for a welfare analysis.

Notes: The figure shows the density of initial AIME in $50 bins as a function of distance of initial AIME to the
upper bend point. The number of observations appears smooth through this bend point, with no sharp change in
slope or level. The upper bend point is where the marginal replacement rate in converting AIME to PIA changes
from 32 percent to 15 percent. The sample includes DI beneficiaries within $1,500 of the upper bend point (see the
text for other sample restrictions). The fraction of the sample in each bin is calculated by dividing the number of
beneficiaries in each bin by the total number of beneficiaries whose AIME is within $1,500 of the upper bend point.
The data are from SSA administrative records.

Notes: We use a bin size of $300 to display the variation in each year as clearly as possible (given the loss of power
when showing only one year at a time). In years before going on DI, AIME refers to the AIME an individual would
have in the prior year, based on their earnings history. In years after going on DI, AIME refers to “initial AIME,” i.e.
from the year before going on DI. Appendix Figure A6 shows the results with the same formatting as other graphs,
i.e. $50 bins.

Notes: The figure shows the mean fraction of years when a beneficiary has positive annual earnings, over the four
years after going on DI (i.e. the mean yearly employment rate over these four years), in $50 bins, as a function of
distance from the bend point. The figure shows that the probability of positive earnings appears to slope upward
more steeply above the upper bend point than below it. See other notes to Figure 2.

Figure 6. Earnings Estimates with Varying Bandwidths

	  

Notes: The figure shows the point estimates and 95 percent confidence intervals (on the y-axis) for the effect of a $1
increase in yearly DI payments on mean yearly earnings in the first four years after going on DI that is implied by
regression kink design model (2), using bandwidths between $500 and $2,000 (on the x-axis). The figure shows that
the absolute value of the point estimate is robustly around 20 cents (or higher), regardless of the bandwidth chosen.
Above a $500 bandwidth, the estimate is significantly different from zero at the five percent level. The vertical line
at $650 shows the bandwidth recommended by the bandwidth selection procedures in Calonico, Cattaneo and
Titiunik (2014a, 2014b). We use the baseline linear specification without controls.

Figure 7. Earnings Estimates for Placebo Kink Locations

Notes: The figure show the point estimates and 95 percent confidence intervals for the effect of a $1 increase in
yearly DI payments on mean yearly earnings in the first four years on DI that is implied by replacing the true kink in
model (2) with “placebo” kink locations at other locations of AIME relative to the true location (normalized to zero).
We use the baseline linear specification without controls. The figure shows that the absolute value of the coefficient
is maximized at the actual bend point (i.e. the coefficient itself is minimized at the actual bend point), supporting the
contention that there is in fact a change in slope occurring at the true bend point.

Notes: ** denotes p<0.05, *** denotes p<0.01. The table shows that the density of the assignment variable (i.e.
AIME just prior to applying for DI) and the distributions of predetermined covariates are smooth around the upper
bend point. For each dependent variable, we test for a change in slope at the bend point using polynomials of order
three to 12. For each of the dependent variables, the table shows: the order of the polynomial that minimizes the
corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc) (Column 1); the estimated change in slope at the bend point and
standard error (Column 2) under the AICc-minimizing polynomial order; and the percent of the regressions with
polynomial orders between three and 12 that show a change in slope that is statistically significant at the five percent
level (Column 3). Before running the regression, we take bin means of variables in 60 equally-sized bins of $50
width around the bend point, so each regression has 60 observations. See other notes to Table 1.

Notes: ** denotes p<0.05, *** denotes p<0.01. The table shows the point estimates and 95 percent confidence
interval on γ, the coefficient on the dummy for being near the kink in initial AIME from regression (4) (reflecting
the excess mass per bin near the kink). For readability, the reported value of γ is the true value multiplied by 10,000.
The mean density of the two bins immediately outside those nearest to the kink is 0.0057 (or 57.27 when multiplied
by 10,000). This is relevant for interpreting estimates of the coefficient γ, as it is always a tiny percentage of 57.27
(on the order of 0.1 percent). The column headings show the different specifications. “Baseline” refers to estimating
a seventh-degree polynomial through the earnings distribution within a bandwidth of $1,500 of the bend point and
estimating the kink from a region within $100 of the bend point. We use bin means of variables in 60 equally-sized
bins of $50 width around the upper bend point, so that each regression has 60 observations. “Covariates” (Column
2) refers to a specification controlling for the mean value of covariates within each bin (mean age, percent male,
percent black, and percent allowed at the hearings stage). “Alternative bandwidth” (Column 3) refers to using a
bandwidth of $650—the bandwidth selected by the procedure of Calonico, Cattaneo, and Titiunik (2014a, 2014b)—
rather than $1,500. “Eighth-degree polynomial” (Column 4) estimates an eighth-order polynomial through the
density rather than a seventh-order. “Excluded region $200” (Column 5) refers to estimating the kink from a region
of $200 around the bend point, rather than $100.

Notes: ** denotes p<0.05, *** denotes p<0.01. The table contains coefficients and standard errors showing the
estimated effect of a one-dollar increase in yearly DI payments on yearly earnings around the upper bend point. The
estimates are based on regression model (2) in the text, which is a regression kink design based on estimating the
change in slope of mean earnings around the upper bend point. “Covariates” refers to a specification controlling for
covariates within each bin (mean age, percent male, percent black and percent allowed at the hearings stage). For the
results in the first row, the full set of regression coefficients are reported in Appendix Table A4; to arrive at the
Table 4 estimates, we transform the Appendix Table A4 estimates by dividing by the change in slope of PIA as a
function of AIME at the bend point, -0.17. The “AICc” is the corrected Akaike Information Criterion and the bolded
estimates minimize the AICc within each row. Before running the regression, we take bin means of variables in 60
equally-sized bins of $50 width around the bend point, so each regression has 60 observations. See other notes to
Table 1.

Notes: ** denotes p<0.05, *** denotes p<0.01. The dependent variable is the fraction of the first four calendar years

point changes and scaled by a $1,000 change in DI payments. Thus, the coefficients reflect the effect of a $1,000
increase in DI benefit payments on the probability that an individual has positive earnings in any given year over the
first four year after going on DI. For more information, see notes to Table 1 and 4.

Notes: ** denotes p<0.05, *** denotes p<0.01. See notes to Tables 1 and 4. The results shown are from the baseline
linear specification without controls and are bolded when this specification minimizes the corrected AICc. All
displayed results minimize the AICc except the results for those whose primary disability is cancer; in this case, the
baseline linear specification minimizes the Bayesian Information Criteria but not the AICc. The elasticity is
calculated as the scaled coefficient multiplied by the PIA value at the kink and divided by the average earnings at
the kink, as measured by the constant in the regression. The “scaled coefficient” refers to the change in earnings (in
cents) in response to $1 more in the Primary Insurance Amount (PIA), i.e. the quantity that is reported in the other
main tables. “DDS” refers to Disability Determination Services, i.e. beneficiaries allowed by the initial DI examiner.

Appendices (for online publication)
Appendix 1: Illustrative framework for analyzing responses
To ground the empirical analysis, in this Appendix we briefly review a simple lifecycle
framework for understanding the effects of the policy change, as well as a static model. Our
framework is adapted from Blundell and MaCurdy (1999) to our particular context in which we
observe pre-tax-and-transfer earnings as the key outcome of interest. Thus, rather than modeling
the tradeoff between consumption and hours worked as in Blundell and MaCurdy, we model the
tradeoff between consumption and pre-tax earnings. In other words, following Saez (2010) and
other papers that have access to administrative data on earnings but not on hours worked, we
model individuals as trading off consumption, in which utility is increasing, against pre-tax
earnings, in which utility is decreasing because it requires effort to produce earnings.
Assume, then, that each individual has a quasi-concave utility function that is separable
across time from periods t to T: U t = U(U t (Ct , Et , Xt ),U t+1 (Ct+1 , Et+1 , Xt+1 ),...U T (CT , ET , XT )) ,
where Ct and Et are respectively consumption and pre-tax-and-transfer earnings in period t. Xt
refers to additional variables that could affect utility. Utility is maximized subject to the
intertemporal budget constraint:
At+1 = (1+ rt+1 )(At + Bt + Yt + Et (1− τ t ) − Ct )
where At represents assets in period t, Bt is DI benefit income, Yt is other non-asset unearned
income (where Yt has been appropriately adjusted so that virtual income is correctly specified), τt
represents the net effective marginal tax rate including the effects of DI benefits as well as taxes,
and rt+1 is the interest rate.
With uncertainty, dynamic programming techniques yield the following problem, subject
to the asset accumulation rule above:
V (At ,t) = max{U(Ct , Lt , Xt ) + κ Et [V (At+1 ,t + 1)]}
Here κ represents the discount factor. Standard dynamic programming techniques yield the
following first-order conditions:
U C (Ct , Et ) = λt
U E (Ct , Et ) ≥ λt (1− τ )t
λt = κ Et [ λt+1 (1+ rt+1 )]
where λt represents the marginal utility of lifetime wealth in period t.
Earnings supply can then be written as a function of the marginal utility of wealth and
and the net implicit tax rate:
Et = L(λt ,1− τ t , Xt )
λt reflects the effects of all future income streams and therefore captures the effects of lifetime
income, whereas 1− τ t reflects price effects. To arrive at a specification where mean earnings can
serve as the dependent variable (as in our empirical work), we can linearize the expression for Et
above:
Et = αλt + β (1− τ t ) + γ Xt
Here α reflects an income effect, and β reflects a substitution effect.
In our empirical context, it is possible to distinguish two sets of years:

	  

39

	  
1. Years before the DI income is anticipated to arrive. In these years, there should be no
discontinuous change in slope of earnings at the bend point, because the discontinuous
change at the bend point in the slope of the marginal utility of lifetime wealth has not yet
been anticipated. There should also be no bunching at the convex kink created by the
discontinuous change in the marginal replacement rate at the bend point (see Appendix
2), because the substitution effects created by DI are not anticipated.
2. Years after the DI income has been anticipated to arrive. In these years, we should see a
change in slope of earnings arise at the bend point, due to the income effect of lifetime
wealth. If substitution effects are greater than zero, we should also see bunching arise in
the earnings distribution at the bend point.
As described in Blundell and MaCurdy (1999), if agents behave completely myopically
or if capital markets are constrained so that it is not possible to transfer capital across periods
(e.g. individuals wish to borrow but are liquidity constrained), then a static specification is
appropriate. In Blundell and MaCurdy’s static, linearized specification, earnings in a given time
period t can then be written as a function of the net returns to work 1− τ t in that period, unearned
income Bt+Yt, and other factors Xt:
Et = α (Bt + Yt ) + β (1− τ t ) + Xt
In this case, we would expect no change in slope at the bend point prior to going on DI, but if
there are income effects then we would expect a change in slope after going on DI. Since
earnings supply in each period is determined by the net returns to work in that period, we also
would not expect bunching at the convex kink prior to going on DI, but if substitution effects are
greater than zero then we would expect bunching to arise after going on DI.
As in Imbens, Rubin, and Sacerdote (2001), given that DI transfer payments are constant
from year to year, in the lifecycle model with no myopia, we can also derive this specification by
assuming that utility is Stone-Geary. In particular, we can assume that utility is given by:
T
1
U t = ∑ τ =t
[θ E ln(Et − γ E ) + θ C ln(Ct − γ C )] ,
(1+ δ )τ
where δ is the discount rate, and θ E , θ C , γ E , and γ C are preference parameters. Individuals are
again subject to the intertemporal budget constraint: 	  
At+1 = (1+ rt+1 )(At + Bt + Yt + Et (1− τ t ) − Ct )
Imbens, Rubin, and Sacerdote (2001) show that in this context, earnings in each year can be
expressed as a linear function of the DI annuity transfer payments in each year, as in the static
specification:1
Et = α (Bt + Yt ) + β (1− τ t ) + Xt
As described in the main text, our estimation strategy is valid if other unobserved
determinants of work (e.g. Yt) do not lead to a change in slope in the outcome at the bend point.
The models above also do not consider the option value of work that has been considered in the
DI context (e.g. Coile 2015), though as a benchmark the models above illustrate certain key
forces determining earnings.

The Imbens et al. model is in the context of the determination of hours worked, but it easily extends to the context
of earnings, exactly as the extension of the dynamic labor supply model in Blundell and MaCurdy (1999)
generalizes to the earnings context as shown above.

Appendix 2: Model of earnings response and procedure for estimating excess normalized
bunching at kink
2.a. Saez (2010) Model
In Saez (2010), individuals maximize utility u(c,z;n) over consumption, c, and costly
earnings, z.2 Heterogeneity is parameterized by an “ability” parameter n, which is distributed
according to the smooth CDF F(⋅). Individuals maximize utility subject to the following budget
constraint: c = (1− τ )z + R , where R is virtual income and τ is the marginal tax rate. Thus, this is
a static model, as in the static model described in Appendix 1. We refer to the “tax rate” created
by the conversion of AIME to PIA. We stress that DI is not administered through the tax system
and does not create an actual tax. Rather, the economic theory used to describe the incentives this
creates is parallel to that governing the effects of taxes. We adopt the tax rate terminology to be
consistent with previous literature estimating the effects of taxes on non-linear budget sets. The
decrease in the “marginal net-of-tax rate” at the convex kink in the theory corresponds in our
empirical context to the decrease in the marginal replacement rate at the bend point in the AIMEto-PIA conversion formula.
Following Saez (2010), we use a quasi-linear and isoelastic utility function:
n
z
u(c, z;n) = c −
( )1+1/ε
1+ 1 / ε n
Consider first a linear tax schedule with a constant marginal tax rate τ0. Observe that with a
smooth distribution of skills n, we have a smooth distribution of earnings that is monotonic in
skill, provided we make the typical Spence-Mirlees assumption. We refer to individuals’
earnings on a linear tax schedule as their “initial” earnings. The probability distribution function
of initial earnings is given by h0(.).
Now consider the introduction of a piecewise linear tax schedule with a convex kink: the
marginal tax rate below earnings level z* is τ0, and the marginal tax rate above z* is τ1> τ0. Given
the tax schedule, individuals bunch at the kink point z*; as explained in Saez (2010), the realized
density in earnings has an excess mass at z*. Those initially locating between z* and some higher
earnings level Δz* will bunch at the kink z* once the piecewise linear tax schedule has been
introduced.
The “excess mass” B of bunchers will be:

B= ∫

z*+ Δz*

z*

h(ξ )dξ 	  

where ξ is the dummy of integration. Define “normalized bunching” b as the amount of bunching
at the kink normalized by the density at the kink h(z) under a linear tax schedule:
B
b≡
h(z)
2.b. Procedure for estimating excess mass
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
2

This section often corresponds closely to the description of the Saez methodology in Gelber, Jones, and Sacks
(2014).

	  

41

	  
We seek to estimate the “excess mass” at the kink, i.e. the fraction of the sample that
locates at the kink under the kinked tax schedule but not under the linear tax schedule. Following
a standard procedure in the literature (e.g. Saez 2010), we estimate the counterfactual density
(i.e. the density in the presence of a linear budget set) by fitting a smooth polynomial to the
earnings density away from the kink, and then estimating the “excess” mass in the region of the
kink that occurs above this smooth polynomial. 	  
Specifically, for each earnings bin zi, we calculate pi, the proportion of the sample with
earnings in the range [zi-k/2,zi+k/2). The earnings bins are normalized by distance-to-kink, so
that for zi=0, pi is the fraction of all individuals with earnings in the range [0,k). To estimate
bunching, we assume that pi can be written as:

pi = ∑ d=0 β d (zi )d + ∑ j=− k γ 1{zi = j} +ε i
D

k

(6)

and run this regression (where 1 denotes the indicator function and j denotes the bin). This
equation expresses the earnings distribution as a degree D polynomial, plus a set of indicators for
each bin within kδ of the kink, where δ is the bin width. In our empirical application, we choose
D=7, δ=50 and k=1 as our baseline (so that two bins are excluded from the polynomial
estimation). As we show, our results are robust to alternative choices of D, δ, and k. 	  
Our measure of excess mass is M̂ = 2kγˆ , the estimated excess probability of locating at
the kink (relative to the polynomial term). This measure depends on the counterfactual density
near the kink, so to obtain a measure of excess mass that is comparable at the kink, we scale by
the predicted density that we would obtain if there were a linear budget set. This is just the
constant term in the polynomial, since zi is the distance to zero. Thus, our estimate of normalized
M̂
excess mass is B̂ =
. We calculate standard errors using the delta method. We calculate the
β̂ 0
density in each bin by dividing the number of beneficiaries in the bin by the total number of
beneficiaries within the bandwidth; note that this normalization should not affect the excess
normalized mass or the estimated density, because dividing by the total number of beneficiaries
within the bandwidth affects the numerator (i.e. M̂ ) and denominator (i.e. β̂ 0 ) of the expression
for B̂ (=

	  

M̂

β̂ 0

) in equal proportions and therefore should have no impact on B̂ .

Notes: The figure shows that actual PIA (as measured in our data) is determined by AIME in the way the policy
dictates, i.e., with a 90 percent marginal replacement rate below the lower bend point, a 32 percent marginal
replacement rate between the lower and the upper bend point and a 15 percent marginal replacement rate above the
upper bend point. In both the upper and lower bend point samples, more than 90 percent of beneficiaries in the
sample have an actual PIA that is within $2 of the PIA estimated from the statutory formula. The average difference
between actual and estimated PIA is $1.97 and $1.24 in the upper and lower bend point samples, respectively.

Notes: Panel (a) of the figure is identical to Figure 4 but uses the same formatting as elsewhere in the paper,
i.e. with $50 bins. Panel (b) shows mean monthly earnings over all four calendar years prior to applying to
DI, in $50 bins, as a function of distance from a bend point. At the lower bend point in Panel (b) there
appears to be a slight decrease in slope at the bend point, though this is not statistically robust as we show
in the appendix table estimates of the placebo effects at the lower bend point. See notes to Figure 2.

Notes: The figure shows the number of observations in $50 bins as a function of distance from the bend
point. The figure shows that the number of observations appears smooth through this bend point. The
sample includes DI beneficiaries within $500 of the lower bend point. The AIME of $791 constrains the
bandwidth to a value less than that (given that we seek to use a bandwidth that is symmetric on both sides
of the bend point). In practice, there are almost no observations below an AIME of $200, as beneficiaries
with such low earnings are unlikely to have sufficient quarters of coverage to qualify for DI. Therefore, we
use a baseline bandwidth of $500 at the lower bend point. See other notes to Figure 2.

Notes: The figure shows that the density is smooth around the lower bend point when plotted in bins
defined relative to the final AIME observed in our four-year period. This demonstrates that substitution
effects are not evident. If substitution effects were operating, we should see bunching in final AIME at the
bend point. The fraction of the sample in each bin is calculated by dividing the number of beneficiaries in
each bin by the total number of beneficiaries whose AIME is within $500 of the upper bend point. See
other notes to Figure 8.

Figure A10. R-squared as a function of “placebo” kink location around the upper bend

Notes: following Landais (2014), we show the R-squared of the baseline model when the kink is placed at
“placebo” locations around the upper bend point. The R-squared is maximized close to the actual bend
point, suggesting that we are estimating a true kink in the outcome.

Notes: The figure shows that the density of final AIME is smooth around the upper bend point. This
demonstrates that substitution effects are not evident; if substitution effects were operating, we should see
bunching in final AIME at the bend point. The fraction of the sample in each bin is calculated by dividing
the number of beneficiaries in each bin by the total number of beneficiaries whose final AIME is within
$1,500 of the upper bend point. Final AIME represents AIME after having been on DI for four years. Note
that Figure A12 is subtly different than Figure 2.

Notes: ** denotes p<0.05, *** denotes p<0.01. The table contains the full results of model (2) run within $1,500 of the
upper bend point for all nine specifications. β2 refers to the change in slope at the bend point, from regression (2) in the
main text. The estimates in the last row are equal to β2 scaled by the 17 percentage point decrease in the slope of PIA as a
function of AIME at the upper bend point, when it moves from 32 to 15 percent. The “AICc” is the corrected Akaike
Information Criterion. For more information, see notes to Tables 1 and 4.

Notes: See notes to Table 1. The table reports coefficients and standard errors showing the estimated effect
of a one-dollar increase in yearly DI payments on yearly earnings. “AICc” is the corrected Akaike
Information Criterion. The estimates are based on regression model (2) in the text, which is a regression
kink design based on relating earnings to the distance between a beneficiary’s AIME and the bend point of
the formula transforming AIME into PIA. The data are from SSA administrative records. The bolded
estimates minimize the AICc within each row.

Notes: ** denotes p<0.05, *** denotes p<0.01. The table shows that the basic results are robust to choosing
other bin sizes or to running the regressions at the individual level (rather than the bin level). In the
individual-level regressions, we cluster by $50 bin; the standard errors are also similar when we cluster at
other bin sizes. The standard errors are smaller when we do not cluster, reinforcing our conclusion that the
estimates are precise. “AICc” is the corrected Akaike Information Criterion. See notes to Tables 1 and 4.

Notes: ** denotes p<0.05, *** denotes p<0.01. The table shows estimates of model (2) when the dependent
variable is a dummy for whether the beneficiary had suspended DI payments due to working (panel A); a
dummy for termination of DI due to working (panel B); and the value of foregone DI payments due to
sufficiently high non-DI earnings (panel C). We run linear probability models in Panels A and B. “AICc” is
the corrected Akaike Information Criterion. See notes to Tables 1 and 4.

Notes: ** denotes p<0.05, *** denotes p<0.01. The table shows the point estimates and 95 percent
confidence interval for γ, the coefficient on the dummy for being near the kink, defined in terms of final
AIME, from regression (4) (reflecting the excess mass per bin near the kink), which is multiplied by 10,000
for the reader’s ease. The mean density per bin (multiplied by 10,000) in the two bins immediately outside
those nearest to the kink is 57.68. The table shows that the estimated values of γ are negligible relative to
the underlying density (on the order of 0.1 percent as large), indicating that there is no evidence of excess
bunching at this kink and therefore no evidence of a substitution effect. “Baseline” refers to estimating a
seventh-degree polynomial through the earnings distribution using a bandwidth of $1,500 and estimating
the kink from a region within $100 of the bend point. We take bin means of variables in 60 equally-sized
bins of $50 width around the upper bend point, so that each regression has 60 observations. “Covariates”
(Column 2) refers to a specification controlling for covariates within each bin (mean age, percent male,
percent black, and percent allowed at the hearings stage). “Alternative bandwidth” (Column 3) refers to
using a bandwidth of $650—the bandwidth selected by the procedure of Calonico, Cattaneo, and Titiunik
(2014a, 2014b)—rather than $1,500. “Eighth-degree polynomial” (Column 4) estimates an eighth-order
polynomial through the density rather than a seventh-order. “Excluded region $200” (Column 5) refers to
estimating the kink from a region of $200 around the bend point, rather than $100. Appendix Table A8
shows the implied elasticities, estimated using the model of Saez (2010), which require more assumptions
and should be viewed as illustrative of the relevant range of the elasticity. In these estimates, the estimated
elasticities cluster near zero, with confidence intervals that rule out elasticities larger than a moderate level
(0.36 or smaller).
