Endogenous pricing to market and financing costs
1.

Introduction and summary
The puzzling lack of a tighter association between goods' prices and the exchange rate is one of the

intriguing observations in International Economics. Following Krugman (1987), pricing in domestic currency
and pricing to market (PTM) have provided an interpretation to this puzzle.1 A direct implication of the PTM
hypothesis is the low pass-through from the exchange rate to prices, and the resultant failure of the relative PPP
to hold in the short and intermediate-runs. While the empirical literature confirmed these predictions, it also
detected a systematic heterogeneity of the patterns of PTM across various goods.2 Recent studies also suggest
that the relative PPP holds better in emerging markets.3 An important unresolved question concerns the
conditions under which PTM is endogenously chosen by the producers, and when should we expect the relative
PPP to hold more tightly. Addressing these questions is crucial for a better understanding of issues like the
welfare implications of exchange rate volatility, the incidence of protective policies, and the welfare ranking of
fixed versus flexible exchange rate regimes.
The purpose of this paper is to provide a framework where the degree of pricing to market is
endogenously determined, as part of the problem of balancing the benefits of pre-set prices with the costs of
managing the delivery system needed to support rigid prices. This paper is motivated by the inherent trade-off
between price and quantity adjustments, where pricing in local currency requires that quantities should be
plentiful to fulfill the demand at the pre-set price. Hence, pricing in local currency

-2and pricing to market may involve complex issues of delivery management. In such a system, the degree of
local currency pricing is impacted by the financial costs of timely delivery of goods, as well as by the
transportation costs associated with timely re-supply of inventories.4
The paper departs from the pervious pricing to market literature by allowing time dependent
transportation costs. The presumption is that the cost of delivering a good ordered ahead of time is lower than
the cost of a last minute delivery, as pre-buying would allow to find the cheapest means of transportation, even if
it would require more time to deliver [see Carlton (1979) for a pioneering analysis on costly delivery lags].5
We model the implications of time dependent transportation costs on the pricing and the delivery of imports in a
2 period, 2 goods model, where the second period terms of trade are random. Allowing time dependent
transportation costs adds a dimension of investment to the pre-buying of imports. With uncertain future terms of
trade, spot market imports resembles an option -- one exercises the option of last minute imports if the realized
terms of trade are favorable enough.
The above suggests a simple way of modeling endogenously the switch from pricing to market to a
flexible price environment. Assuming that the expected discounted cost of last minute delivery is higher than
pre-buying, it follows that in countries where the terms of trade volatility is small, most imports are pre-bought,
and the spot market for imports is inactive. In these circumstances the prices of importables are delinked from
the realized terms of trade, as is the case in the pricing to market (PTM) regime. Greater volatility induces more
frequent realizations of relatively high and low values of the real exchange rate. For terms of trade volatility high
enough, it would make sense to scale down the pre-buying, in order to exploit the "good tail" of the real

4

These issues were sidestepped by most of the literature by assuming instant delivery of traded goods.

5

An example of these considerations is the pricing of heating oil to consumers, where the "pre-buy

protection plan" allows consumers to purchase forward the desired amount of heating oil at a pre-set price that
is expected to be lower than the future spot market price for last minute delivery. Each spring customers in New
England are advised -- "Before the weather turns colder, protect and insulate your wallet from the inevitable
rising costs of home heating oil. This program (the pre-buy) allows you to lock into fuel oil prices while they are
low, and pay that one low fixed price for your entire year's usage, no matter how high the prices may soar."

-3exchange distribution, where spot market imports are cheaper. In these circumstances, we will obverse a mixed
regime -- if the realized real exchange rate is favorable enough, imports are purchased in the spot market, the
price of imports is determined by the realized real exchange rate, and a version of relative PPP holds.
Otherwise, the pricing to market will prevail. As is the case with options, the value of the option of spot market
imports increases with the volatility, implying that the frequency of pricing to market tends to be lower in more
volatile economies.
Another implication of time dependent transportation costs is that financial considerations determine the
frequency of pricing to market, and the deviations from relative PPP. Specifically, higher financing costs would
increase the cost of pre-buying, encouraging spot market imports, reducing the frequency of pricing to market,
increasing the tendency of relative PPP to hold, and increasing the expected price of imports. The net effect is
welfare reducing as the PTM shields consumers from the adverse purchasing power effects of weak terms of
trade. This result is of special relevance for emerging markets, where limited financial depth and costly credit
encourage spot market trade, and discourage pre-buying. It suggests 2 channels explaining why relative PPP
may hold better for emerging markets -- first the volatility, and second the financing costs. Both imply less
frequent pricing to markets, and greater association between the exchange rate, the prices of imports, and the
volume of trade. While the 2 channels reinforce each other in reducing the incidence of PTM, they have
different welfare implications. Our discussion shows that, for a given real interest rate, higher terms of trade
volatility tend to increase welfare. Higher financing costs are always welfare reducing, and are associated with
lower imports.6
The implications of pricing to market on the desirable exchange rate flexibility have been studied by
comparing the behavior of the nominal exchange rate and prices in regimes with polar pricing rules for imports.
In the first, import prices are set in producer's currency, as has been the traditional assumption in the MundellFleming open economy macro models. In the second system, import prices are set in consumer currencies, in
line with the pricing to market literature.7 These studies pointed out that the welfare ranking of fix versus
6

These effects are potentially large, and provide an interpretation for the potential use of cutting trade

credit as a means of inducing borrowers to service their debt.

-4flexible exchange rate regimes and the dynamics of output and consumption hinge on the pricing rule. For
example, Devereux and Engel (1998) report that "When prices are set in producer's currency, as in the
traditional framework, we find that there is a trade-off between floating and fixed exchange rates. Exchange rate
adjustment under floating rates allows for a lower variance of consumption, but exchange rate volatility itself
leads to a lower average level of consumption. When prices are set in consumer's currency, floating exchange
rates always dominate fixed exchange rates." Our findings imply that the pre-setting prices in consumer's
currency would not characterize emerging markets, and would be observed more frequently in the OECD
countries. This finding, combined with the Devereux and Engel (1998) results, may provide another explanation
for the "fear to float" by emerging market economies.
Section 2 describes the model, and characterizes the impact of a higher discount rate and higher terms
of trade volatility for the case of linear intertemporal preferences. Section 3 investigates the welfare
consequences of higher financing costs. Section 4 concludes. The Appendix extends the model to risk averse
agents.

The model
Assume a small economy producing a domestic traded good, and consuming both domestic and foreign

goods (denoted by x and y , respectively). Imports are associated with transportation costs that depend on the
delivery lag. We focus on the simplest version of the model - a 2 period endowment model, where the supply
of the domestic good in period i is xi (i = 1, 2). The domestic and the foreign markets are geographically
separated. Imports of the foreign goods are subject to time dependent transportation costs, assumed to be
higher for last minute delivery.8 Consider the case where the consumer's utility H is the discounted value of
temporal utilities vt (t = 1, 2) -- 9

For simplicity of presentation, we assume that imports are consumed only in the second period. We normalize
the first period prices of the domestic good to 1. Consumers can pre-buy imports in the first period for a
scheduled delivery in the second period. The "pre-buying" price of y2 is 1 + t units of x1 ( t stands for the
transportation costs, where the implicit cost of y2 , net of transportation and financing, is normalized to 1).
Consumers may postpone buying y to the second period, relying on the spot market. The spot market price of
y2 is random

8

Pre-buying may be cheaper also if production costs are lower when producers have more lead time

[see Carlton (1979) for further discussion of this possibility]. The logic of our analysis applies also to the case
where production costs are time dependent.
9

With utility (1) the demand for imports is likely to be independent from income, simplifying the analytical

discussion. It can be shown that the main results of the paper are applicable to other utilities, though the
analytical discussion is more involved.

where t˜ is the transportation cost for spot "last minute" deliveries, and ε is a random shock determining the
second period international relative price of the domestic good. We denote by f (ε ) the corresponding p.d.f. of
the "external terms of trade," defined in the interval ε ≤ ε ≤ ε , where − 1 < ε . We denote by y2p the prebuying of imports contracted for second period delivery, and by y2s the spot market imports. The opportunity
costs of imports y2p ; y2s in terms of exports sold in period 1 and 2 are denoted by x1p ; x 2s , respectively, where

To avoid a corner solution stemming from the linearity of the intertemporal utility we assume first that
ρ = r *. The drawback of using the linear intertemporal utility is that it does not allow us to investigate fully the
effects of changing the financing cost on the optimal patterns of pre-buying. We will address these issues in the
Appendix, where we illustrate how to extend the analysis to allow for risk averse consumers. The consumer
problem is to determine the optimal pair < x 2s ;x1p > . We solve it backwards -- first we find the optimal spot
market trade in the second period. Next, applying this solution we construct the expected utility in the first
period. Finally, we find the pre-buying that maximizes this expected utility.
The consumer determines the second period consumption plan by finding the spot market imports that
would maximize

The last line in (10) implies that the consumer will exercise the option of spot market imports in the second
period only if the terms of trade were favorable enough -- if ε * < ε . Otherwise (when ε * > ε ), the second
period supply of imports is determined by the pre-buying of y. In these circumstances the prices of imports are
delinked from the realized terms of trade, as is the case in the pricing to market (PTM) regime.
Equation (6) indicates that the choice of the optimal pre-buying determines also the range where PTM
ε*

applies, occurring with probability F(ε *) =

∫ f (ε ) dε .

It implies that increasing the pre-buying of imports

ε

reduces the range where the option of spot market imports would be exercised, increasing the frequency of
PTM. This suggests that the optimal pre-buying of imports tends to be lower the greater the value of the
flexibility associated with the option of using the spot market is, as will be the case when the terms of trade
volatility go up. Pre-buying implies also implicit saving, hence the opportunity cost of pre-buying increases with
the discount rate. This suggests that a higher discount rate would reduce the pre-buying, thereby increasing the
range where the option of imports via the spot market is exercised.
We verify these claims by studying the first order condition determining the optimal pre-buying

The expected gain from pre-buying is the discounted expected marginal utility induced by pre-buying minus the

The term c is the expected relative intertemporal cost of the spot market to forward imports.10 Henceforth we
will assume that c > 1 , as will be the case if last minute delivery is relatively costly (Section 4 reviews the results
for the case when c < 1 ). The equilibrium relative price in the second period is determined by the ratio of the
marginal utilities of the 2 goods --

Hence, if the realized terms of trade are favorable enough ( ε > ε * ), the spot market for imports is active. In

these circumstances, the price of imports is determined by the realized real exchange rate, y,2 =
, and the

denote it by FL.
If the realized terms of trade are weak (ε < ε * ), no spot market trade will take place, and the PTM

regime will prevail, y,2 =
. Hence, optimal pre-buying of imports shields the consumer from the "bad

- 11 Hence, the relative price of imports in the PTM regime increases with the discount factor ρ . This suggests that
a higher discount factor will reduce the optimal pre-buying, and will increase the frequency of PTM.
Proposition 1 summarizes the resulting pricing system:

Proposition 1
a.

Higher discount rate, higher pre-buying transportation cost, and lower transportation cost of imports

purchased in the spot market reduce the first period pre-buying. This in turn implies that the frequency of PTM
drops and the frequency of flexible prices (FL regime) increase.

b.

Low volatility economies are characterized by PTM. Spot market imports would be observed if the

volatility of the terms of trade exceeds a threshold. Above that threshold, higher volatility will reduce the
frequency of PTM, increasing spot market imports. A low enough probability of PTM may reverse the impact
of volatility.

Proof
Proposition 1a follows from the observation that a lower c would reduce the valuation of the expected gain

from pre-buying, reducing the optimal pre-buying of imports (recall that c =
). We denote the

This situation is summarized in Figure 1, where the downwards sloping curves depict the marginal
benefit of pre-buying imports [LHS of (12')] for varying values of the ε * (note that (6) implies that higher ε *
corresponds to a higher pre-buying of imports). The optimal threshold ε * (and the corresponding optimal prebuying of imports) is determined at L = 0, at point A for curve ZZ. Increasing c shifts the curve upwards,

- 12 increasing thereby the optimal pre-buying of imports, and the frequency of PTM. For a high enough c we
converge to a pure PTM pricing system, where spot market imports would be too expensive for all possible
future terms of trade realizations. A lower c shifts this curve downwards, reducing thereby the optimal threshold

Figure 1 -- Marginal Benefit of Pre-buying imports
The Figure traces the dependency of L on ε * , for a uniform distribution, where f (ε ) = 1 / ( 2ε ) , and ε = 0.4 .
The solid, dashed and dotted curves correspond to c = 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, respectively.

The intuition for result 1b is that in the absence of any volatility, c > 1 implies that pre-buying is cheaper,
hence the PTM regime will prevail. Greater volatility induces more frequent realizations of relatively high and
low real exchange rates. For volatility high enough, it would make sense to scale down the pre-buying, in order
to exploit the "good tail" of the real exchange distribution, where spot market imports are cheaper.

- 13 We illustrate the impact of higher volatility by considering a uniform distribution of the terms of trade
shock, where ε = −ε .11 In these circumstances the first order condition determining the frequency of PTM,

Figure 2 depicts the dependency of the frequency of PTM on the terms of trade volatility, for different

See Aizenman (1984) for a model of deviations from PPP in a one good world, where the domestic and

the foreign markets are separated by time independent transportation costs. It is shown there that even in that
simpler world, the association between volatility and deviations from PPP may be reversed for a high enough
volatility.

Financing costs, volatility and welfare
The empirical literature suggests that import prices are more responsive to the exchange rate in emerging

markets. Our discussion in the previous section suggests two independent channels explaining this finding –
volatility and financing costs. The purpose of this section is to investigate the welfare cost of these channels, and
to identify which of the two has a greater impact on the overall welfare of a country. One way to address these
issues with linear, risk neutral preferences is to assume that the interest rate exceeds the discount factor, and all
pre-buying is financed by credit, as would be the case if x1 = 0 , and r* > ρ . This is a special example of the
model studied in Section 1, corresponding to s = − x1p ; v1 = 0 . The first order condition determining the
optimal level of pre-buying in these circumstances is15

We assume that the interest rate and the terms of trade volatility are not too high, resulting in an internal
equilibrium where some pre-buying takes place, and 0 < F < 1. Proposition 2 summarizes the resulting pricing
system:

Proposition 2
a.

Higher financing costs increase the expected price of imports, reducing the expected deviations from

relative PPP, and reducing welfare.
b.

For a given real interest rate, higher terms of trade volatility tend to increases welfare.

- 19 Equation (28) implies that the net effect is proportional to the difference between the average utility at the tail
points (A and C, equal to the height of point H) and the expected utility across the entire support. The
convexity of curve ABC implies that this difference is positive. Consequently, a greater terms of trade volatility
increases the expected utility.17
We illustrate the quantitative nature of these results with the help of a simulation. The bold curve in
figure 4A traces the dependency of the probability of the PTM regime on the interest rate. The bold curve in
Figure 4B traces the dependency of the probability of the PTM regime on volatility. The contours in both
panels trace the welfare relative to the benchmark at points Q and Q', respectively, where F = 1. Note that
increasing the interest rate from zero to about 0.3 eliminates the pre-buying, and induces a welfare drop of
about 6.5%. This welfare drop is due to the elimination of gains from the pre-buying -- gains attributed to the
ability to protect the purchasing power against weak future terms of trade. It can be shown that the welfare
drop is associated with a large drop in average imports [from 0.44 at point Q, to 0.29 at point M]. Volatility by
itself, however, enhances welfare, as is shown in Figure 4B.

17

Figure 3 assumes a uniform distribution. Similar logic implies that if the demand for imports is elastic

(i.e., if 0.5 < β ), a mean preserving increase in the terms of trade volatility would increase welfare for all
probability distribution functions.

Concluding remarks
Our discussion provides two possible explanations for why relative PPP holds better for emerging

markets. Higher volatility of terms of trade and higher financial costs in emerging markets should induce tighter
association between the exchange rate and imports prices. While we treated the interest rate and the volatility
as independent, the two are likely to be positively correlated. First, if the domestic capital market in emerging
markets is segmented from the global market, one expects credit to be financed by risk averse agents who
would demand a higher interest rate to compensate for the higher volatility. Second, the literature on costly state
verification pointed out that volatility tends to be associated with higher financial costs [see Townsend (1979)].
Hence, one expects that higher terms of trade volatility will increase the cost of credit. Applying this association,
one may combine Figures 4A and 4B together, tracing the combined effects of the volatility and the interest rate
channels. In these circumstances, one expects that the net welfare effect of volatility will be negative -- the
higher cost of credit will terminate PTM, eliminating any welfare gains from higher volatility. We illustrate this in
Figure 5, which assumes a linear association between terms of trade volatility and financing costs. The bold line
outlines the dependency of the probability of the PTM regime on the volatility. The contours trace the welfare,
relative to the benchmark at point L, where F = 1.
A key assumption of our paper is that pre-buying is cheaper -- the discounted expected cost of spot
market imports exceeds the expected cost of pre-buying imports. One expects this assumption to hold better
for goods and commodities with high freight/value ratio (oil, cars, etc.). Our methodology is applicable even if
this assumption is violated.18 To simplify, we assumed competitive pricing. The analysis can be readily

18

The discounted expected cost of spot market imports is below the expected cost of pre-buying if the

interest rate is high enough, or if the transportation cost of last minute delivery is not significantly higher than the
transportation cost of pre-buying. In these circumstances, if the volatility of the terms of trade is low, no imports
are pre-bought [hence F = 0]. For high enough volatility, some imports are pre-bought, at a level that is
determined by (12), and F > 0. Even in these circumstances, proposition 2 continues to apply -- a higher
interest rate would reduce the probability of PTM, would increase the expected price of importables, and would
reduce the expected deviations from relative PPP.

- 22 extended to allow for monopolistic competitive pricing, where the market power would impact on the pricing
rule.
Our paper suggests that in the circumstances facing emerging markets, pricing to market would be
observed less frequently than in the OECD countries. Hence, in evaluating the choice of exchange rate regimes
for emerging markets, assuming relative PPP is likely to describe better the economic environment. This in turn
suggests a bias towards lower flexibility of the exchange rate in emerging markets. First, lower flexibility of the
exchange rate may reduce the real interest rate in segmented capital markets (see Aizenman and Hausmann
(2000), where this channel is modeled). Second, as Devereux and Engel (1998) showed, pricing to market
biases the choice in favor of a flexible exchange rate by the resultant delinking of domestic prices from the
exchange rate, a bias that would not hold for emerging markets where the pricing to market is not a viable
option.

volatility, r = 0.5ε . The bold line depicts the dependency of F on the volatility. The contours trace the welfare
relative to the benchmark at point L, where F = 1.

- 24 Appendix A

The paper assumed risk neutral agents, with intertemporal linear preferences. While these assumptions
simplified the analysis, the linear model has a limited ability to account for the impact of a higher interest rate.
This Appendix illustrates how to extend our analysis to the case of risk averse consumers. Specifically, suppose
that with the exception of preferences, all the assumptions of the paper hold. The consumers maximize the
expected value of

.

The consumer's problem is to determine the optimal triplet < x 2s ; x1p ; s > . We solve it backwards -- first we
find the optimal spot market trade in the second period ( x2s ). Next, applying this solution we construct the
expected utility in the first period. Finally, we find the pre-buying and the saving ( x1p ;s ) that maximizes this
s

expected utility. Note that the first part of the solution (optimal ( x2 )) is identical to the one in Section 2,
because it deals with the patterns of consumption in the second period, after the uncertainty of the terms of trade
has been resolved. Hence, equation (5) - (9) continue to hold. Applying these conditions to (A2), we infer that
the first order conditions determining the optimal saving and the optimal pre-buying are

where U' = ∂ U / ∂x is the marginal utility of x (the domestic good). There are two ways to transfer purchasing
power from the first to the second period -- saving and pre-buying. The first order conditions in (A3) imply that
intertemporal arbitrage exhausts the utility gain from intertemporal trade. Optimal saving is reached when the
first period marginal utility of x equals the interest rate times the expected marginal utility of the second period
consumption, discounted by the subjective rate of time preference (see (A3a)). Similarly, optimal pre-buying
equates the marginal utility of the first period consumption of x (= the opportunity cost of x in the first period) to
the discounted expected marginal utility induced by pre-buying 1/(1+t) units of second period y (see (A3b)).
The impact of higher financing costs are summarized in the following proposition:
Proposition A1
Higher interest rate reduces the first period pre-buying for small savings. This in turn implies that the
frequency of PTM goes down.

Proof
A higher interest rate would increase the relative price of pre-buying. This would lead to a substitution
away from pre-buying to spot market delivery, reducing the incidence of pricing to market. The assumption that
the net saving is small implies that the induced income effect due to the interest rate change is small, and hence
the substitution effect would dominate.
We illustrate it for the case where φ = 1 (hence U(v) = ln v ). Similar methodology applies for the case
where φ ≠ 1 . The first order conditions can be rewritten as
