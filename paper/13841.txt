Globalization and the Great Divergence: Terms of Trade Booms and Volatility in the Poor
Periphery 1782-1913

NBER Working Paper No. 13841
March 2008
JEL No. F01,N7,O2
ABSTRACT
W. Arthur Lewis argued that a new international economic order emerged between 1870 and 1913,
and that global terms of trade forces produced rising primary product specialization and de-industrialization
in the poor periphery. More recently, modern economists argue that volatility reduces growth in the
poor periphery. This paper assess these de-industrialization and volatility forces between 1782 and
1913 during the Great Divergence. First, it argues that the new economic order had been firmly established
by 1870, and that the transition took place in the century before, not after. Second, based on econometric
evidence from 1870-1939, we know that while a terms of trade improvement raised long run growth
in the rich core, it did not do so in the poor periphery. Given that the secular terms of trade boom in
the poor periphery was much bigger over the century before 1870 than after, it seems plausible to infer
that it might help explain the great 19th century divergence between core and periphery. Third, the
boom and its de-industrialization impact was only part of the story; growth-reducing terms of trade
volatility was the other. Between 1820 and 1870, terms of trade volatility was much greater in the
poor periphery than the core. It was still very big after 1870, certainly far bigger than in the core. Based
on econometric evidence from 1870-2000, we know that terms of trade volatility lowers long run growth
in the poor periphery, and that the negative impact is big. Given that terms of trade volatility in the
poor periphery was even bigger during the century before 1870, it seems plausible to infer that it also
helps explain the great 19th century divergence between core and periphery.

Globalization and the Great Divergence between Core and Periphery

The economic impact of the industrializing core on the poor periphery during the
century before 1870 was delivered by four dramatic global events: a world transport
revolution, a policy move in industrial Europe towards greater openness, an acceleration
in GDP growth rates associated with the industrial revolution, and colonialism. The
transport revolution in seaborne trade connecting ports and in the railroads connecting
ports to interiors helped integrate world commodity markets (O’Rourke and Williamson
1999, Ch. 3; Shah Mohammed and Williamson 2004; Williamson 2005, Chs. 2 and 3).
While the previous literature may have exaggerated the impact of a transport revolution
on ocean trade routes (Jacks 2006; Jacks and Pendakur 2007), it certainly did not
overestimate the impact of the railroads on land routes (Keller and Shiue 2007). Thus, it
is clear that the transport revolution helped fuel the boom in trade between core and
periphery, and helped create commodity price convergence for tradable goods between
all world markets. By raising every country’s export prices and lowering every country’s
import prices, it also contributed to a rise in every country’s external terms of trade,
especially, as it turned out, in the periphery. A move by the European industrial core
toward more liberal commercial policy (Estevadeordal et al. 2003), a commitment to the
gold standard (Meissner 2005) and perhaps even imperialism itself (Ferguson 2004;
Mitchener and Weidenmier 2007) all made additional contributions to the world trade
boom. The accelerating growth in world GDP, led by industrializing Europe and its
offshoots, made an even bigger contribution to the trade boom. The derived demand for
industrial intermediates -- like fuels, fibers, and metals -- soared as manufacturing

3

production led the way. Thus, as the European core and their offshoots raised industrial
output shares, manufacturing output growth raced ahead of GDP growth. Rapid
manufacturing productivity growth lowered their costs and prices in the core, and by so
doing generated a soaring derived demand for raw material intermediates. This event was
reinforced in the core by accelerating GDP per capita growth and a high income
elasticity of demand for luxury consumption goods, like meat, dairy products, fruit, tea,
and coffee. Since industrialization was driven by unbalanced productivity advance
favoring manufacturing relative to agriculture and other natural-resource based activities,
the relative price of manufactures fell everywhere, including the poor periphery where
they were imported. All three forces – liberal trade policy, transport revolutions and fast
manufacturing-led growth -- produced a positive, powerful and sustained terms of trade
boom in the primary-product-producing periphery, an event that stretched over almost a
century. As we shall see, some parts of the periphery had much greater terms of trade
booms than others, and some reached a secular peak earlier than others, but all (except
China and Cuba) underwent a secular terms of trade boom. Factor supply responses
facilitated the periphery’s response to these external demand shocks, carried by SouthSouth migrations from labor abundant (especially China and India) to labor scarce
regions within the periphery, and by financial capital flows from the industrial core
(especially Britain) to those same regions. That is, countries in the periphery increasingly
specialized in one or two primary products, reduced their production of manufactures,
and imported them in exchange.
Eventually these forces abated. A protectionist backlash swept over continental
Europe and Latin America (Williamson 2006a). The rate of decline in real transport costs

4

along sea lanes slowed down before World War I, and then stabilized for the rest of the
20th century (Hummels 1999; Shah Mohammed and Williamson 2004). Most of the
railroad networks were completed before 1913. The rate of growth of manufacturing
slowed down in the core as the transition to industrial maturity was completed there. As
these forces abated, the resulting slowdown in primary product demand growth was
reinforced by resource-saving innovations in the industrial core, induced, in large part, by
those high and rising primary product prices during the century-long terms of trade boom.
Thus, the secular boom faded, eventually turning into a 20th century secular bust during
the interwar slowdown and the great depression of the 1930s. Exactly when and where
the boom turned to bust depended, as we shall see, on export commodity specialization,
but the terms of trade peaked somewhere between 1860 and 1913 throughout the poor
periphery, typically very early in that half century, rather than late. To repeat, the terms
of trade in the periphery peaked long before the crash of the 1930s, in some cases seven
decades earlier.
This paper reports this terms of trade experience for 23 countries located
everywhere around the poor periphery except sub-Saharan Africa (where the data are
missing): the European periphery 1782-1913 (Italy, Portugal, Russia, Spain), Latin
America 1782-1913 (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Columbia, Cuba, Mexico, Peru,
Venezuela), the Middle East 1796-1913 (Egypt, Ottoman Turkey, Levant), South Asia
1782-1913 (Ceylon, British India), Southeast Asia 1782-1913 (Indonesia, Malaya, the
Philippines, Siam), and East Asia 1782-1913 (China, Japan). I focus on the 19th century
secular boom since so much has already been written about the subsequent 20th century
bust, the latter triggered by the writings of Raul Prebisch (1950) and Hans Singer (1950)

5

more than a half century ago. Furthermore, I focus on the period from the 1780s to the
1870s, after which the boom had pretty much run its course. This focus is in sharp
contrast with that of W. Arthur Lewis whose famous writings in the 1970s (Lewis 1978a,
1978b) dealt almost exclusively with the 1870-1913 period. I argue here that his new
international economic order had been established long before the late 19th century and
that Lewis’ timing was off by about three-quarters of a century. I also argue that the
secular terms of trade boom must have contributed far more to the Great Divergence
before 1870 than after. Having established that the secular terms of trade boom in the
periphery led to de-industrialization, slow growth and GDP per capita divergence
between it and the core, I then measure the extent to which terms of trade volatility did
the same. Terms of trade volatility was much greater in the poor periphery than in the rich
core between 1820 and World War I. Since modern development economists have
established that volatility retards growth, and since volatility in the poor periphery was
far greater before 1870 than at any time between 1870 and 1940, I argue that these forces
must have contributed even more to the Great Divergence before 1870 than after.

The Great Divergence

All economic historians agree that a wide income gap between the rich European
core and the poor periphery opened up before 1913. Economic historians do not agree,
however, as to when it opened up, and why. My purpose is not to engage in the when
debate, but rather only to remind us just how much the periphery lagged behind during
this first global century, and to suggest how importantly globalization forces are likely to

6

have contributed to it. Table 1 uses Angus Maddison’s (1995) GDP per capita estimates
to document the Great Divergence after 1820, and real wage data are used to extend his
series backwards to 1775. Between 1775 and 1913, the economic gap between core and
periphery widened greatly: Southern Europe income per capita fell from 75.2 to 47.3
percent of Western Europe, so the gap rose from about 25 to 53 percent; the Eastern
Europe gap rose from 30 to 58 percent; Latin America from about 25 to 59 percent; Asia
from about 44 to 80 percent; and Africa from about 54 to 85 percent. Note that the gap
rose much more before 1870 than after: on average, the poor periphery gap rose by about
27 percentage points up to 1870, but only by about 5 percentage points thereafter. Thus,
Table 1 informs us that the forces causing the Great Divergence were never constant, but
rather that they were much greater before 1870 than after.
I stress the point that the Great Divergence was much more dramatic before 1870
than after since it is consistent with the fact that globalization-induced terms of trade
forces in the poor periphery – to be discussed below – were also much more powerful
before 1870 than after. Furthermore, the modern debate over ‘fundamental’ growth
determinants like culture (Landes 1998; Clark 2007), geography (Diamond 1997; Sachs
2001; Easterly and Levine 2003), and institutions (North and Weingast 1989; Acemoglu,
Johnson and Robinson 2005) in contributing to the Great Divergence cannot speak to
variance in its intensity over time. Indeed, William Easterly and his collaborators (1993)
pointed out some time ago that the contending ‘fundamental’ growth determinants –
culture, geography, and institutions – exhibit far more historical persistence than the 20th
century growth rates they are supposed to explain. What is true for the late 20th century is
even truer for the 19th century. Since globalization forces were variable between 1782

7

and 1913 while the fundamentals were not, the former have a much better chance of
explaining the timing and magnitude of the Great Divergence than the latter.

The Secular Terms of Trade Boom in the Poor Periphery 1782-1913

The Big Picture: Stability, Boom and Bust
Although the number of countries underlying the poor periphery average is
limited for most of the 18th century,1 what we do have reveals no trend in the net barter
terms of trade, that is, in the ratio of the poor periphery’s average export price to its
average import price. The averages are calculated so that the price of each commodity
exported or imported is weighted by the importance of that traded commodity in the
country’s total exports or imports. Furthermore, the poor periphery average is calculated
using fixed country 1870 population weights. The resulting series plotted in Figure 1 is
certainly volatile, but there is no long run trend. This is consistent with a world still
waiting for the industrial revolution, the transport revolution, peace in Europe, liberal
trade policy, and a world trade boom.
Figure 2 describes quite a different century. Excluding China and the rest of East
Asia (more on that below), the terms of trade in the poor periphery soared from the late
18th century to the late 1880s and early 1890s, after which it underwent a decline up to
1913, before starting the interwar collapse about which so much has been written. The
timing and the magnitude of the boom up to the late 1860s and early 1870s pretty much
replicates – but in the opposite direction – the decline in the British terms of trade over

the same period. The secular price boom was huge in the poor periphery: between the
half-decades 1796-1800 and 1856-1860, the terms of trade increased by almost two and a
half times, or at an annual rate of 1.5 percent, a rate which was vastly greater than per
capita income growth in the poor periphery (0.1 percent per annum, Asia 1820-1870;
Maddison 1995: p. 24), and even greater than per capita income growth in Britain (1.2
percent per annum, United Kingdom 1820-1870: Maddison 1995; p. 23).
A rise in the primary-product specializing country’s terms of trade implied, of
course, a fall in the relative price of imported manufactures. And the decline in that price
implied de-industrialization. When Lewis published his now-famous The Evolution of the
International Economic Order in 1978 (based on his 1977 Janeway Lectures), he placed
his emphasis on “the second half of the nineteenth century” (1978a: p. 14). But if we are
looking for Dutch disease forces which caused de-industrialization in the poor periphery
-- the same forces that helped create Lewis’ new international economic order, the
century before 1870 is the place to look, not after.

Chinese and East Asian Exceptionalism
Not every part of the poor periphery followed the average since what a region
traded mattered.2 The best example of this is the biggest country in our sample, China.
Figure 3 plots the terms of trade for China, for the poor periphery with East Asia (and
thus China3) included, and for the poor periphery without it. The difference is astounding.
First, China did not undergo a terms of trade boom over the century before 1913, but
2

Carlos Diaz-Alejandro (1984) made this point some time ago, and called it the “commodity lottery.”
The other member of the East Asian sample is Japan, but it does not enter the sample until 1857. Thus, all
of the differences between the series with and without East Asia can be attributed to China before the late
1850s. In the second half of the century, the population weight for China is so huge, China still dominates
the East Asian terms of trade trends.

rather underwent a secular slump. Second, as the rest of the periphery began the boom
between 1796 and 1821, China underwent its first big collapse, with its terms of trade
falling to one-fifth (sic!) of the 1796 level. Third, when China finally joined the boom
taking place in the rest of the periphery, it was very brief since its terms of trade peaked
out much earlier than the rest, in 1840 after only a two decade boom. Following the early
1860s, China underwent the same slow secular decline in its terms of trade that was
common across much of the poor periphery.4 China’s terms of trade exceptionalism is, of
course, driven by its unusual country-specific mix of imports and exports. On the import
side, what distinguished China from the rest of the periphery was opium. The price of
imported opium rose sharply from the 1780s to the 1820s and it maintained those high
(but volatile) levels until the 1880s (Clingingsmith and Williamson 2007).5 Since opium
imports rose from about 30 to 50 percent of total Chinese imports over the period, the rise
in the opium price helped push China’s terms of trade downwards, and in a direction
opposite to that of the rest of the periphery. Reinforcing that secular fall in China’s terms
of trade, was the fact that it also exported the “wrong” products since the price of silk,
cotton and tea all fell dramatically over the century between the 1780s and 1880s, by 60,
71 and 79 percent, respectively (Mulhall 1892; pp. 471-8).6 Chinese exceptionalism
indeed!
While China was certainly big enough to dominate East Asian trends, it should be
pointed out that Japan was exceptional as well. First, it remained closed to world trade
4

It should be noted that one other country, Cuba, showed “exceptional” terms of trade experience. The
Cuban terms of trade is not plotted in Figure 6, but it fell by 49 percent between 1826 and 1860, and by 50
percent up to 1885-1890. The source of the decline lay, of course, with sugar prices.
5
I am not suggesting here that the price of opium was exogenous to the Chinese market. Indeed, rising
Chinese demand helped account for the price boom.

To repeat the previous footnote, I am not suggesting that the price of silk and tea were exogenous to
China. Indeed, China was a major supplier of both to world markets.

until 1857, so that there is no terms of trade trend worth reporting up to that time. Second,
when Japan was forced to go open by American gunships, it underwent the biggest terms
of trade boom by far, just when the rest of the poor periphery had just about completed its
secular boom. East Asian exceptionalism indeed.

Poor Periphery Variance around the Average
While each region in the poor periphery had much the same import mix (except
for China and its opium), they had very different export mixes. Endowments and
comparative advantage dictated the export mix, and different commodity price behavior
implied different magnitudes during the secular boom, as well as different timing in its
peak. Figures 4-10 document terms of trade performance in each of the six poor
periphery regions, some starting as early as 1782. The regional time series are
constructed as a fixed 1870 population weighted average of the region’s countries (listed
above: the European Periphery four, the Latin American eight, the Middle East three, the
South Asian two, the Southeast Asian four, and the East Asian two). Table 2 and Figure 4
summarize the magnitude of the boom and its length (or peak) by region and by major
country members, making a comparative assessment possible.
European Poor Periphery 1782-1913. Figure 4, Figure 5 and Table 2 suggest
that the shape of the secular boom and bust in the European periphery was pretty much
like that of the overall poor periphery average, with peaks very close together (1855
versus 1860). However, the magnitude of the booms certainly differed. The terms of trade
boom in the European periphery was much greater than the average (2.4 versus 1.4
percent per annum), especially for Italy and Russia. This was also true of the century-

11

long boom up to 1885-90 (1.2 versus 0.7 percent per annum). As we suggest below, these
powerful Dutch disease effects may help explain why the industrial revolution was slow
to spread from the core to the European east and south.
Latin America 1782-1913. Figure 4, Figure 6 and Table 2 report that Latin
America also deviated significantly from the poor periphery average, but on the down
side. The terms of trade boom up to 1860 was much more modest in Latin America.
Indeed, there was very little change at all in the Latin American terms of trade between
about 1830 and 1870. At least the new Latin America republics did not have to deal with
global de-industrialization forces during their ‘lost decades’ of poor growth when
violence and political instability was already doing enough economic damage (Bates,
Coatsworth and Williamson 2007; Williamson 2007). Still, the Latin American terms of
trade boom lasted far longer (1895) than was true for the average periphery region
(1860), more than three decades longer. The more modest early boom in Latin America
and its great length about balanced out, such that the century-long boom was much the
same as in the average poor periphery region (0.9 versus 0.7 percent per annum up to
1885-90). To summarize, de-industrialization forces were very weak in Latin America
during its lost decades, when they were strong everywhere else in the poor periphery; and
they were very strong during its belle époque,7 when they were weak everywhere else in
the poor periphery.
Middle East 1796-1913. Figure 4, Figure 7 and Table 2 document that the terms
of trade facing the Middle East was pretty much like it was for the average poor
periphery: the peak was about the same (1857 versus 1860), and the magnitude of the
boom was similar (1.7 versus 1.4 percent per annum), although it was much more
7

Mexico is an exception. See Dobado, Gómez and Williamson (2008 forthcoming) and Williamson (2007).

12

dramatic for Egypt and Ottoman Turkey (2.7 and 2.5 percent per annum) than it was in
the Levant.8 The magnitude of the century-long boom to 1885-90 was also similar
between the Middle East and the periphery average (0.9 versus 0.7 percent per annum).
In terms of the globalization price shock, the Middle East therefore seems to have been
the most representative of the poor periphery.
South Asia 1782-1913. Our South Asia sample has only two observations,
Ceylon and British India, but the latter is so large that the South Asian weighted average
lies on top of the India series in Figure 8. Like Latin America, India (and thus South
Asia) had a very weak terms of trade boom up to mid-century. The South Asian and the
average periphery terms of trade (still excluding East Asia) peaked only one year apart
(1861 versus 1860), but beyond that similarity there are only differences. The boom in
South Asia up to 1861 was far weaker than the average (0.9 versus 1.4 percent per
annum), and this was even more true over the century to 1885-1890 (no growth versus
0.7 percent per annum). Indeed, all of that early growth in India’s terms of trade took
place up to the 1820s; after that decade, India exhibited great volatility (like the spike up
to 1861) but no secular growth whatsoever. And, to repeat, there was no growth at all in
India’s terms of trade between 1800 and 1890. Like China, India was exceptional, an
especially ironic finding given that the literature on 19th century de-industrialization in
British India has been the most copious and contentious by far, starting with the words of
Karl Marx about the bones of the weavers bleaching on the plains of India (Roy 2000,
2002; Clingingsmith and Williamson 2007).
Southeast Asia 1782-1913. Like Latin America, the terms of trade boom in
Southeast Asia persisted much longer, in this case to 1896, and the size of the century8

Levant is not shown in Table 2, since the series starts only with 1839.

13

long boom up to 1885-90 was much greater (1.4 versus 0.7 percent per annum). Yet,
there was immense variance within the region (Figure 9), much more than elsewhere in
the poor periphery. For example, the terms of trade for Siam grew at only 0.4 percent per
annum over the century up to 1885-90, but it grew almost twice as fast in the Philippines
(0.7 percent per annum), and more than eight times as fast in Indonesia (3.3 percent per
annum). Due to its size, the latter dominates the regional weighted average.
East Asia 1782-1913. We have already discussed Chinese exceptionalism, but
Figure 10 also highlights Japan’s unusual experience. That is, after being forced by
American gunboat diplomacy to go open in 1857 – after centuries of autarchy, Japan
underwent a textbook response (Bernhofen and Brown 2005): the price of importables
collapsed, and the price of exportables soared. Thus, the terms of trade improved, and by
a factor of six or more (sic!) between 1857 and 1913 (Huber 1971; Yasuba 1996).

The Impact of the Terms of Trade on the Great Divergence:
Argument and post-1870 Evidence

How did secular change and volatility of the terms of trade impact economic
growth before 1913? Was the impact asymmetric between rich core and poor periphery?
Can the behavior of the terms of trade in the poor periphery help explain the GDP per
capita divergence over the long 19th century?
Chris Blattman, Jason Hwang and myself (Blattman, Hwang and Williamson
2008) recently used a 35 country data base to explore these questions for the 1870-1939
period. The sample contained 14 from the rich core and 21 from the poor periphery, and

14

it covered about 90 percent of world population in 1900. The impact of secular change
and volatility in the terms of trade was reported separately for the core and periphery,
making it possible to test for the presence of any asymmetric impact between them.
Asymmetry regarding secular impact was predicted by the following reasoning. To the
extent that the periphery specialized in primary products, and to the extent that industry is
a carrier of development, then positive price shocks reinforced specialization and caused
de-industrialization in the periphery, offsetting the short run income gains yielded by the
terms of trade improvement. However, there should have been no such offset in the
industrial core, but rather a reinforcement, since specialization in industrial products
would have been strengthened there by any improvement in the terms of trade. Thus, the
prediction was that while a secular terms of trade improvement unambiguously raised
growth rates in the industrial core, it did not do so in the periphery. The asymmetry
hypothesis was strongly supported by evidence covering the seven decades after 1870.
The core benefited from a secular increase in its terms of trade since it reinforced
comparative advantage there, helped stimulate additional industrialization, thus
augmenting growth-induced spillovers. That is, dynamic effects reinforced static effects.
The fact that the periphery, in contrast, did not benefit when the terms of trade rose over
the long term, or suffer when it fell, appears to confirm some dynamic offset to more
conventional static gains from trade. The place to look for the source of dynamic
asymmetry between secular impact on core and periphery is likely to be deindustrialization. However, since the secular terms of trade peak had already been
reached by the 1880s, there was hardly any terms of trade boom left to make a

15

contribution to divergence between 1870 and 1939. However, there was such a boom
before 1870.
We expected the same asymmetry with respect to terms of trade volatility given
that ‘insurance’ was cheaper and more widely available in the core. Modern observers
regularly point to terms of trade shocks as a key source of macroeconomic instability in
commodity-specialized countries, but, until very recently, they paid far less attention to
the long run growth implications of such instability.7 Most theories stress the investment
channel in looking for connections between terms of trade instability and growth. Indeed,
the development literature offers abundant modern microeconomic evidence linking
income volatility to lower investment in both physical and human capital. Households
imperfectly protected from risk change their income-generating activities in the face of
income volatility, diversifying towards low-risk alternatives with lower average returns
(Dercon 2004; Fafchamps 2004), as well as to lower levels of investment (Rosenweig and
Wolpin 1993). Furthermore, severe cuts in health and education follow negative shocks
to household income in poor countries—cuts that disproportionately affect children and
hence long term human capital accumulation (Jensen 2000; Jacoby and Skoufias 1997;
Frankenburg et al. 1999; Thomas et al. 2004).
Poor households find it difficult to smooth their expenditures in the face of shocks
because they are rationed in credit and insurance markets, so they lower investment and
take fewer risks with what remains. Poor firms find it difficult to smooth net returns on
their assets, so they lower investment and take fewer risks with what remains. Perhaps

For important early exceptions, see Mendoza (1997), Deaton and Miller (1996), Kose and Reizman
(2001), Bleaney and Greenway (2001) and Hadass and Williamson (2003). I review the more recent
(booming) literature below in the text.

most importantly, poor governments whose revenue sources are mainly volatile customs
duties (Coatsworth and Williamson 2004; Williamson 2005, 2006a) and which also find
it difficult to borrow at cheap rates locally and internationally, cannot, without serious
difficulty, smooth public investment on infrastructure and education in the face of terms
of trade shocks.8 Lower public investment ensues, and growth rates fall. In short, theory
informs us that higher volatility in the terms of trade should reduce investment and
growth in the presence of risk aversion. In addition, the less-risky investment that does
take place will also be low-return.
Modern evidence seems to be consistent with the theory. Using data from 92
developing and developed economies between 1962 and 1985, Garey and Valerie Ramey
(1995) found government spending and macroeconomic volatility to be inversely related,
and that countries with higher volatility had lower mean growth. This result has since
been confirmed for a more recent cross-section of 91 countries (Fatás and Mihov 2006).
Studies like these have repeatedly found that volatility diminishes long run growth, and
we now know more about why it is especially acute in poor countries. In an impressive
analysis of more than 60 countries between 1970 and 2003, Steven Poelhekke and
Frederick van der Ploeg (2007) find strong support for the core-periphery asymmetry
hypothesis regarding volatility, and with a large set of controls. Furthermore, while
capricious policy and political violence can and did add to volatility in poor countries,
extremely volatile commodity prices “are the main reason why natural resources export
revenues are so volatile” (Poelhekke and van der Ploeg 2007: p. 3) and thus why those

While greater volatility increases the need for international borrowing to help smooth domestic
consumption, Catão and Kapur (2004) have shown recently that volatility constrained the ability to borrow
between 1970 and 2001. It seems likely that the same was true between 1870 and 1901, a century earlier,
and even more so before 1870 when a global capital market was only just emerging (Obsfelt and Taylor
2004; Mauro et al. 2006).

economies are themselves are so volatile. While we have offered some reasons why poor
countries face higher volatility and why that higher volatility costs them so much more in
diminished growth rates, Philippe Aghion and his collaborators (2005, 2006) offer more:
macroeconomic volatility driven either by nominal exchange rate or commodity price
movements will depress growth in poor economies with weak financial institutions and
rigid nominal wages, both of which characterized all poor economies before 1913 even
more than it characterizes them today.9 Thus, “given the high volatility of primary
commodity prices … of many resource-rich countries, we expect resources-rich countries
with poorly developed financial systems to have poor growth performance” (Poelhekke
and van der Ploeg 2007: p. 6).
What is true of the modern era was thought by Blattman et al. (2008) to be even
more true of 1870-1939 when more undeveloped financial institutions and more limited
tax bases made it even harder for poor households, poor firms and poor governments to
smooth expenditures. Analysis bore this out: greater volatility diminished growth in the
periphery, but not in the core. Strong support for the asymmetry hypothesis for the 18701939 years was especially welcome since that result raised the value of a research agenda
that would explore its implications for the post-1870 years. Furthermore, the economic
effects for 1870-1939 were very large: a one-standard-deviation increase in terms of trade
volatility lowered output growth by nearly 0.39 percentage points, a big number given
that the average per capita growth rate in the periphery was just 1.05 percent per
annum.10 These magnitudes suggest that terms of trade volatility was an important force

(2007).

A contemporary estimate has it that a one-standard-deviation increase in output volatility in the Third
World lowers annual GDP per capita growth by 1.28 percentage points (Loayza et al. 2007: 345-6). While

behind the rising Great Divergence between core and periphery after 1870. The gap in
per capita income growth rates between core and periphery in the 1870-1939 sample was
0.54 percentage points (1.59 – 1.05). Had the periphery experienced the same (lower)
terms of trade volatility as the core, price volatility would have been reduced, adding 0.16
percentage points to average GDP per capita growth rates there. This alone would have
erased about a third of the output per capita growth gap (0.16/0.54=0.3). In addition, had
the core experienced the same secular deterioration in its terms of trade that the periphery
did (-0.28), instead of the observed positive 0.3 percent per annum growth rate, this
would have reduced output growth there by 0.37 percentage points. Combined, these two
counterfactual events would have eliminated nearly the entire gap in growth rates
between core and periphery between 1870 and 1939.
At least for the seven pre-1940 decades, globalization seems to have had a bigger
impact on the Great Divergence than did the so-called fundamentals. To put it more
modestly, it appears that terms of trade shocks were an important force behind the
substantial divergence in income levels between core and periphery during Lewis’ post1870 epoch. Note, however, that secular movements in the terms of trade contributed less
to the growth gap between core and periphery after 1870 than did volatility (0.16 versus
0.37). The secular boom before 1870 ought to have contributed much more to the Great
Divergence to the extent that the terms of trade boom in the poor periphery was so much
bigger. And the contribution would have been bigger still if volatility was also bigger
before 1870.

this is certainly a bigger growth impact than that estimated for 1870-1939 (0.39), the modern estimate is an
output volatility impact, not, as for 1870-1939, a price volatility impact. That is, this modern estimate does
not identify source of the output volatility.

Impact of the Terms of Trade Boom on the Pre-1870 Poor Periphery

There should be no doubt that these global price shocks reinforced comparative
advantage around the poor periphery, giving a powerful incentive to primary product
export expansion while severely damaging import-competing manufacturing. That is,
powerful de-industrialization (or Dutch disease) forces were set in motion everywhere in
Latin America, Africa, the Middle East and Asia, helping contribute to Lewis’s new
international economic order. Just how powerful depended on the size of the export and
import-competing sectors. Where trade was a big share of GDP, and where, conversely,
non-tradable activities were a small share of GDP, the de-industrialization impact was
also big. It depended as well on whether and the extent to which the non-tradable food
sector was able to keep the cost of food low, and thus the nominal wage in manufacturing
low and competitiveness high. It also depended, of course, on the extent to which the
poor periphery could absorb and use effectively the new European industrial
technologies. All of these factors mattered, but the main determinant was the size of the
price shock itself. Where the secular terms of trade boom was greatest, deindustrialization should have been greatest, ceteris paribus. Lewis and most of the
subsequent literature has argued that the big de-industrialization impact occurred between
1870 and 1913 (Lewis 1969, 1978a, 1978b; Tignor 2006: pp. 256-60). Based on the new
terms of trade evidence just reviewed, it appears that Lewis was off by three-quarters of a
century; the big impact must have been during the century before 1870 when the terms of
trade boom was so much bigger.
So much for timing. What about location of de-industrialization? To make the
comparative judgment, look at the annual growth rate in each country’s terms of trade up
20

to its country-specific 19th century peak (Table 2). According to this criteria, 19th century
Dutch disease and de-industrialization effects must have been much more powerful in the
European periphery than they were anywhere else in the periphery, even more so than the
tropical periphery that Lewis stressed (1969, 1978a). It follows that part of the
explanation for a lag in the spread of the industrial revolution to the European periphery
(Gerschenkron 1966; Pollard 1981) might be blamed, at least in part, on these powerful
terms of trade forces. The second strongest de-industrialization effect should have been in
the Middle East and Southeast Asia, at least up to the late 1850s and early 1860s.11 The
weakest de-industrialization effects were in East Asia; indeed, since China’s terms of
trade deteriorated, it might be expected that industry was favored there, helping account
for industrial success in Shanghai. The next weakest de-industrialization effects must
have been in Latin America where the terms of trade boom was almost half that of the
periphery average. Perhaps it is no longer a puzzle why Mexico and other parts of Latin
America were so effective in fending off the global forces of de-industrialization up to
1870 (Dobado, Gómez and Williamson 2008; Williamson 2007). Nor was South Asia far
behind since its terms of trade boom was not much bigger than that of Latin America. To
the extent that India underwent one of the most dramatic rates of de-industrialization in
the poor periphery (Clingingsmith and Williamson 2007), that experience must be
attributed to domestic forces rather than to external price shocks.
When the magnitude of the secular terms of trade boom is measured up to 188590, the regional ranking remains pretty much the same. South Asia drops farther down
11

Note that the Middle Eastern and Southeast Asian regional terms of trade growth rates to peak are not
always bounded by the country rates reported for those regions in Table 2. One reason is that some
countries embedded in the regional averages are not reported in Table 2: e.g. Levant and Malaysia. Another
is that the regional averages are weighted, and are often extended backwards on the basis of a small
country.

21

the list with even weaker terms of trade effects (indeed, close to zero), the relatively rapid
terms of trade growth of Southeast and the European periphery persist, and East Asia
continues its exceptional terms of trade decline. The Latin America boom keeps the
modest middle ground, and the Middle East joins it. Thinking comparatively helps.
Consider two examples. First, and to repeat, the South Asia result should surprise any
specialist who is steeped in the enormous and contentious literature on Indian deindustrialization written by nationalist historians. However, the facts are that the terms of
trade shock facing South Asia in general, and India in particular, were very modest,
implying that much of the de-industrialization India underwent was of its own supplyside doing (Clingingsmith and Williamson 2007). Second, Latin American economic
historians make much of export-led growth after 1870 during what they call the belle
époque, implying that the region exploited these world market conditions better than the
rest of the periphery (Bulmer-Thomas 1994: Chps. 3 and 4). Yet, the Latin American
terms of trade boom was not much greater than the periphery average, and for Mexico it
was much less (Gómez Galvarriato and Williamson 2008).

Impact of Terms of Trade Volatility on the Pre-1870 Poor Periphery

By 1870 and certainly by the end of the 19th century, most countries in the poor
periphery had responded to the terms of trade boom by exploiting comparative advantage
and increasing their specialization with the export of just a few commodities. The top two
exports made up 70 percent of all exports from the average poor periphery country in
1913 (Bulmer-Thomas 1994: p. 59), while the figure was only 12 percent in the industrial

22

core even two decades earlier (Blattman et al. 2008: Table 1). Furthermore, most
countries in the poor periphery had raised exports so that they claimed a large share of
GDP by 1890. Finally, while some of these commodities had prices which were a lot
more volatile than others, primary products generally had much more volatile prices than
did manufactures exported by the core.
Was the deleterious impact of volatility as powerful before 1870 as it was
afterwards? While limited data make it impossible to estimate the impact, we can
certainly calculate whether the volatility was as great or even greater before 1870, and
infer the deleterious impact on periphery growth and thus its contribution to divergence.
Table 3 summarizes the results using the Hodrick-Prescott filter, where the United
Kingdom is taken to be representative of the core. That said, terms of trade volatility was
much greater in the UK during the wartime years 1782-1820, than it was in the peacetime
Pax Britannica century that followed. This result is hardly surprising given what we
know about the volatility of the conflict itself and its stop-go impact on trade (Findlay
and O’Rourke 2007). The peacetime years after 1820 were another matter entirely.12
First, terms of trade volatility in the periphery was more than three times what it was in
the UK, either in 1820-1870 (9.18/2.91 = 3.2) or 1870-1913 (7.09/2 = 3.5).13 It is of some
interest to note that the ratio of terms of trade volatility between industrialized economies
and the periphery in the 1990s was 2.9.14 Apparently, there has been a lot of historical

12

David Jacks, Kevin O’Rourke and myself are collecting monthly commodity price data 1750-1913 to
explore more fully these volatility issues, one dealing with the impact of the world going open during Pax
Britannica, and the other dealing with asymmetry between manufactures and primary products.
13
It may at first seem that the UK should have had the same terms of trade volatility as the periphery since
it imported all those commodities with volatile prices. However, the UK imported a diverse market basket
of primary products while each periphery exported just one or two.

deviation of the logarithmic change.

persistence in the data, even though the difference between core and periphery was
greater in the 19th than in the late 20th century. Second, terms of trade volatility in the
periphery rose over the century, from 6.46 before 1820 to 9.18 between 1820 and 1870,
and to 7.09 after 1870, a result consistent with evolving export concentration as the
region exploited comparative advantage. Third, terms of trade volatility varied
considerably around the periphery. Between 1820 and 1870, the highest volatility
measures were recorded in the European Periphery (especially Italy and Russia), the
Middle East (especially Egypt and the Levant), and East Asia (especially China), regions
whose long run economic progress must have suffered accordingly. Latin America and
Southeast Asia consistently recorded lower volatility than the rest of the periphery, but it
was still more than twice that of the United Kingdom. South Asia was about average, but
it was still more than three times that of the United Kingdom. If we are looking for
countries in the periphery where terms of trade volatility would have had an especially
powerful deleterious effect on GDP growth performance before 1870, the places to look
would be China, Cuba, Egypt, India, Italy, Levant, the Philippines, and Russia. But with
the exception of Brazil and Japan, every periphery country had much higher price
volatility than did the European core before 1870. There were no exceptions after 1870:
every country in the poor periphery had higher price volatility than did the United
Kingdom.
Given that terms of trade volatility was higher before1870 than after, and given
that this volatility contributed powerfully to the Great Divergence after 1870, it seems
reasonable to infer that terms of trade volatility in the periphery contributed even more
powerfully to the Great Divergence before 1870 than after.

Concluding Remarks

W. Arthur Lewis (1978a, 1978b) and the literature that followed his pioneering
work has argued that a new international economic order emerged between 1870 and
1913, and that global terms of trade forces induced rising primary product specialization
and de-industrialization in the poor periphery. This paper has offered five revisionist
findings that speak to the Lewis thesis. First, it has shown that the new order was firmly
in place at the start of Lewis’ epoch, and that the transition took place in the century
before 1870, not after. Lewis was off by three-quarters of a century. Second, based on
econometric evidence from 1870-1939, we know that terms of trade booms did not raise
long run growth in the poor periphery, but lowered it. Given that the secular terms of
trade boom in the poor periphery was much bigger over the century before 1870 than
after, it seems safe to infer that it helps explain the Great Divergence between core and
periphery. Third, the terms of trade boom varied enormously across the poor periphery,
and therefore its contribution to periphery performance must have varied as well.
Over the century before the late 1880s, the boom was completely absent in East and
South Asia, about average in the Middle East and Latin America, and powerful in
Southeast Asia and the European periphery. Fourth, the terms of trade boom (with its deindustrialization impact) was only half the story; growth-reducing terms of trade
volatility was the other half. Between 1820 and 1870, terms of trade volatility was much
greater in the poor periphery than the core, in some cases six or seven times greater. By
Lewis’ post-1870 epoch, terms of trade volatility was still very big in the poor periphery

25

and still much greater than the core, in some cases four to five times greater. Based on
econometric evidence from 1870-1939 and 1960-2000, we know that terms of trade
volatility has lowered long run growth in the poor periphery, and that the negative impact
has been big. Given that terms of trade volatility in the poor periphery was even bigger
during the century before 1870, it seems plausible to infer that it helps explain the Great
Divergence between core and periphery. Fifth, and finally, since the secular terms of
trade boom in the poor periphery reached its peak in the mid-late 19th century, deindustrialization forces should have abated afterwards. Indeed, as the terms of trade
started its long secular decline in to the 20th century, those prior de-industrialization
forces should have become re-industrialization forces, that is, industrialization in the
poor periphery should have been favored by secular terms of trade deterioration in the
half century or more before 1930, an ironic finding given the rhetoric of Prebisch and
Singer. Furthermore, the re-industrialization stimulus should have been strongest in
locations where the terms of trade peak was earliest and the fall the steepest. These
locations would have included East Asia (e.g. China), the European periphery (e.g. Italy
and Russia), Latin America (e.g. Brazil and Mexico), and South Asia (e.g. India). During
the decades before 1913, early industrialization was taking place in all of these places,
but how much of that is explained by a secular (pro-industrial) terms of trade slump,
better pro-industrial policies, improved wage cost competitiveness in manufacturing, or
getting the ‘fundamentals’ right?15

Galvarriato and Williamson 2008).

Notes and sources 1775: The projection backwards to 1775 is based on unskilled
real daily wages, and is an 1750-1799 average. The southern and eastern Europe
trends 1775-1820 are assumed to be the same, and the African trend 1775-1820
is assumed to replicate Asia. For Europe and Asia (India); Broadberry and Gupta

Notes: The following countries are excluded from the table's detail since their series begin too late (starting
date in parentheses): Portugal (1842); Columbia (1865), Peru (1865), Venezuela (1830); Levant (1839);
Malaysia (1882); and Japan (1857). These country observations were used, however, when constructing the
regional aggregates and the All Periphery aggregate. Where it says "start", the calculation is the average of
the first five years. Where it says "peak", the calculation is for the five years centered on the peak year. The
regional and all the periphery averages are weighted by 1870 population.

Appendix
The post-1865 terms of trade data were first collected with Chris Blattman and
Jason Hwang (BHW) in working papers underlying “The Impact of the Terms of Trade
on Economic Development in the Periphery, 1870-1939: Volatility and Secular Change,”
Journal of Development Economics (forthcoming 2008). The 1865-1913 data underlying
Figures 2-10 reported in this paper are based on my revisions of the BHW data. Several
sources were used frequently, in addition to the ones listed under Part 2 below: Brian R.
Mitchell, International Historical Statistics, Europe, 1750-1988 (New York: Stockton
Press, 1992); Brian R. Mitchell, International Historical Statistics: The Americas, 17501988 (New York: Stockton Press, 1993); Brian R. Mitchell, International Historical
Statistics: Africa, Asia & Oceania, 1750-1993 (New York: Stockton Press, 1998); all
hereafter Mitchell.
The revised 1865-1939 BHW data set contains 35 countries, while the focus here
is on the pre-1865 poor periphery subset of 21: Latin America (6) – Argentina, Brazil,
Chile, Cuba, Mexico, Venezuela; European Periphery (4) – Italy, Portugal, Russia, Spain;
Mideast (3) – Egypt, the Ottoman core (present day Turkey and some of the Balkans),
Levant (present day Iraq, Israel, Lebanon, Palestine, Jordan, Syria); South Asia (2) –
Ceylon, British India (including present day Bangladesh and Pakistan); Southeast Asia
(4) – Indonesia, Malaya, the Philippines, Siam; and East Asia (2) – China, Japan. While I
have the data to expand the pre-1865 poor periphery sample size, these additional country
pre-1865 time series are much shorter and thus have been excluded here.
1. The 1865-1913 Terms of Trade Data for the Poor Periphery
A net barter terms of trade (NBTT) series was calculated from original sources, where the
NBTT is simply the ratio of export to import prices, each weighted appropriately:
pijtX ⋅ wijX
∑
NBTT jt =
∑ pitM ⋅ wiM

for product i, country j, and period t. In this formulation, the export price index in the
numerator is country-specific while the import price index in the denominator is not.
Three different import price indices have been used in the denominator, giving rise to the
TOT1, TOT2 and TOT3 estimates (see below) for each country where the terms of trade
were calculated in this way. This is a simplification employed due to (i) the limited
quality and quantity of data on imports and import prices for countries in the periphery,
and (ii) the similarity observed, in what records are available, between the composition of
developing country imports. While detailed data on exports weights and prices are
available for virtually all of the countries and all of the years in our sample, import data
are much more limited. These limitations and their consequences are discussed below.
Export Weights: Export weights have been calculated by individual country using the
current value of major commodity exports and fixed weights. The use of a fixed set of
weights is essential for disentangling price from quantity movements. Of course, any
such approach is fundamentally flawed, not least because over a long period of time the
mix of major commodity exports can shift significantly. A compromise position was
45

taken by changing the export weights at approximately 20-year sub-periods. These subperiods are 1870-1890 and 1890-1913, and within these sub-periods the weights are
calculated using sample year data. Export values for major commodities for Argentina,
Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, Mexico and Peru are taken from Mitchell, International
Historical Statistics The Americas 1750-1993, p. 506ff, Table E3. The revised data for
Uruguay come from the data underlying John H. Coatsworth and Williamson, “The
Roots of Latin American Protectionism: Looking Before the Great Depression,” in A.
Estevadeordal, D. Rodrik, A. Taylor and A. Velasco (eds.), FTAA and Beyond: Prospects
for Integration in the Americas (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 2004). The
revised data for Chile come from Juan Braun, Matias Braun, Ignacio Briones, Jose Diaz,
Rolf Luders, and Gert Wagner, Economia Chilena 1810-1995: Estadisticas Historicas
(Santiago: Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile 2000), pp. 125-128.) The data for
Burma, Ceylon, India, Indonesia, Japan, the Philippines, and Siam come from
Mitchell, International Historical Statistics Africa, Asia and Oceania 1750-1993, p.
637ff, Table E3. The revised data for Egypt and Ottoman Turkey come from
Williamson and Tarik Yousef, “Globalization, Policy and Competitiveness: DeIndustrialization in Egypt 1790-1913” and “Globalization and De-Industrialization in the
Ottoman Empire 1790-1913,” ongoing 2008. Main commodity exports for Greece and
Portugal were calculated from Statistical Abstract for Principal and Other Foreign
Countries (London: 1876-1912) and Die Wirtschaft des Auslandes, Statistisches
Reichsamt (Berlin: 1928). The revised data for Spain come from Leandro Prados de la
Esosura: “Terms of Trade and Backwardness: Testing the Prebisch Doctrine for Spain
and Britain during Industrialization,” unpublished (sent to the author in 2005), and El
progresso economico de Espana (Bilbao, Spain: 2003). Russia’s export weights for the
first two subperiods come from Statistical Abstract for Principal and Other Foreign
Countries (London: 1876-1912), and the second two subperiods from Michael Dohan,
Two studies in Soviet terms of trade, 1918-1970 (Bloomington: International
Development and Research Center, Indiana University, 1973). Export weights for Serbia
come from Holm Sundhaussen, Historische Statistik Serbiens, 1834-1914: mit
Europaischen Vergleichsdaten (Munchen: R. Oldenbourg, 1989) for the first two
subperiods, and for the latter two from Die Wirtschaft des Auslandes, Statistisches
Reichsamt (Berlin: 1928). Export weights for China were obtained from Hsiao LiangLin, China’s Foreign Trade Statistics 1864-1949 (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University
Press 1974). Only major export products were included (those whose value exceeded 5%
of total trade value). These include beans and bean products, cotton yarn and piece goods,
raw cotton, silk piece goods, raw silk, and tea. Eggs and egg products were omitted due
to lack of price data.
Export Prices: Export prices are quoted in foreign markets (wherever possible, in the
UK). Wholesale prices for Wheat, Maize, Rice, Beef, Butter, Sugar, Coffee, Tea, Iron,
Copper, Tin, Lead, Coal, Cotton, Flax, Hemp, Jute, Wool, Silk, Hides, Nitrate, Palm
Oil, Olive Oil, Linseed, Petroleum, Indigo and Timber are taken from Sauerbeck,
“Prices of Commodities and Precious Metals,” Journal of the Statistical Society of
London 49(3) (September 1886), Appendix C, for the years 1860-85; Sauerbeck, “Prices
of Commodities During the Last Seven Years,” Journal of the Royal Statistical Society
56(2) (June 1893), p. 241ff, for the years 1885-1892; Sauerbeck, “Prices of Commodities
in 1908,” Journal of the Royal Statistical Society 72(1) (March 1909) for the years 1893-

46

1908; Sauerbeck, “Wholesale Prices of Commodities in 1929,” Journal of the Royal
Statistical Society 93(2) (1930), p. 282ff for the years 1908-1929; Sauerbeck, “Wholesale
Prices of Commodities in 1916,” Journal of the Royal Statistical Society 80(2), p. 289ff
for the years 1908-1916; and Sauerbeck, “Wholesale Prices in 1950,” Journal of the
Royal Statistical Society 114(3) (1951), p. 417ff for the years 1916-50. Prices for Cocoa,
Crude Oil, Rubber, Tobacco and Zinc are taken from Historical Statistics of the United
States: Colonial Times to 1970, Bicentennial ed., Part 1 (Washington: US Department of
Commerce, Bureau of the Census, 1975). Cotton Yarn, Cotton Piece Goods and Silk
Piece Goods were approximated using the textiles price index from the same source.
Prices for Fruits and Nuts 1880-1914 are taken from Jose M. Critz, Alan L. Olmsted and
Paul W. Rhode, “International Competition and the Development of the Dried Fruit
Industry 1880-1930,” in S. Pamuk and J. G. Williamson (eds.), The Mediterranean
Response to Globalization before 1950 (London: Routledge, 2000), Table 8.2. Prices for
Opium 1860-1906 are taken from Ahmad Seyf, “Commercialization of Agriculture:
Production and Trade of Opium in Persia, 1850-1906,” International Journal of Middle
East Studies (1984), Table 4. Prices for Beans and Bean Products were calculated from
Liang-Lin (1974), pp. 80ff.
Import Weights: A set of three different import indices were employed uniformly for all
non-European countries in the old BHW data base. TOT1 uses British export data to
determine the import price index in the denominator, TOT2 uses an index of US
manufacturer’s prices, and TOT3 uses an index of US consumer and manufacturer’s
prices. Historical import data, unlike that of exports, are almost uniformly poor in
countries outside the European core. Traditionally, studies of country terms of trade have
compensated for this lack of data through the use of British export data as a proxy for the
imports of less developed nations. This approach is undesirable if the composition of
British exports is unrepresentative of the imports of developing countries as a whole, or
to the extent that the use of current-year weights means that movements reflect changes
in composition, not just prices. As an alternative, however, BHW employed a fixed index
of non-primary goods from US statistics. This import index, like the British one, is
country invariant. In the end, the differences are not material; the two series are almost
identical (probably due to the heavy content of metals and textiles in both indices). This
US manufactured export statistic is a weighted sum of the prices of textiles (55%),
metals (15%), machinery (15%), building materials (7.5%), and chemicals and
pharmaceuticals (7.5%). A fixed weighting for all developing nations may, of course,
be unrepresentative of any country’s specific import mix. Yet, such a metric may be quite
relevant for measuring the changing value of the country's exports relative to a fixed
package of manufactured products available for import. In this sense our terms of trade
represents the purchasing power of local commodities in terms of rich-country goods. In
any case, a review of each nation's external commerce documents reveals remarkably
similar import compositions. For the years 1870-1900, import composition for Ceylon
and India was examined from Statistical abstract for the several colonies and other
possessions of the United Kingdom no.1-40, 1863-1902. Import composition data for
Burma come from Teruko Saito and Lee Kin Kiong, Statistics on the Burmese Economy
(Singapore: Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, 1999), p. 177, table VII-4. Import
composition data for China, Egypt, Greece, Japan, Portugal, and Russia were
calculated from Statistical Abstract for Principal and Other Foreign Countries (London:

Turkey are calculated from Michael G. Mulhall, Dictionary of Statistics (London 1892),
p. 145 for the year 1888. For the years 1900-1939, import weights for Ceylon and India
are calculated for several reference years from Statistical abstract for the several British
self-governing dominions, colonies, possessions, and protectorates no.41-53, 1903-1915,
Statistical abstract for the several British oversea dominions and protectorates no.54-59,

abstract for the British Commonwealth no.69-70, 1945-1947 and Statistical abstract for
the Commonwealth (trade statistics) no.71-72, 1948-1951. Composition of main imports
for reference years after 1900 for Chile, Greece, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, Portugal,
Russia, Serbia, Siam, Spain and Uruguay comes from Die Wirtschaft des Auslandes
1900-1927 (Berlin 1928). Data for Burma comes from Saito and Kiong (1999), p 177,
Table VII-4. Data for the Philippines is taken from Foreign Commerce of the Philippine
Islands, Washington 1912-1913 for the reference years 1907, 1908 and 1910.
Composition of main imports for Turkey was calculated from Annuaire Statistique,
Republique Turque, vol.1, pp. 103, 106, and vol. 3, pp. 313 and 314 for the years 1923,
1926 and 1929.
Import Prices: US price series for textiles, metals, machinery, building materials, and
chemicals and pharmaceuticals come from Historical Statistics of the United States, Part
1 (1975), pp. 200-1.
A Note on Import and Export Price Data: UK and US prices are employed for the TOTj
estimates under the assumption that the prices in these large, integrated and (in the UK, at
least) unprotected markets would supply us with a relatively reliable "world" price index
for each commodity group. A chief disadvantage of using such world price indices,
however, is that home market prices in each country may diverge from the world market
prices in the short and even long term. This may be because of transport costs,
differences in product features and quality, variations in the composition of the products
within a category, and less-than-perfect market integration. But the key disadvantage of
not using the home market price is the distortion created by changes in transport
costs. Overall, though, the advantages of employing world price indices outweigh these
disadvantages. First, home market prices are not available for most periods and most of
our countries. Rather, only the somewhat less desirable unit prices (calculated as the
value of imports divided by the volume) are available. Second, UK and US market prices
are probably more reliable, accurate and comparable given the quality of reporting (at the
time) and the quality of scholarship on these prices since then. Third, to the extent that
commodity markets are well integrated worldwide, the UK and US market prices should
approximate the world price. This is especially true given that this paper is interested in
price changes, not levels. To the extent that UK and US prices move in similar directions
and with similar magnitudes compared with prices in the rest of the world, these "world"
price indices will represent well price changes relative to an index year in other
nations. Fourth, these foreign market price indices would have been available to (and
probably used by) industrialists and policymakers throughout the period in question.
Accordingly, for questions of policy response (and perhaps price setting) foreign market
48

indices may be a more appropriate data source than those in home markets. Fifth, the use
of a world price index harmonizes and simplifies construction of the indices, enabling us
to examine a wider sample of countries.
2. The Pre-1865 Terms of Trade Data for the Poor Periphery
Twenty-one important regions in the periphery offer terms of trade estimates from points
well before 1865, some deep into the 18th century, thus covering the era prior to the midnineteenth century when the relative price of primary products underwent their largest
boom. In every case but Argentina and Mexico, these series are taken up to 1913 and
replace the 1865-1939 BHW data; for Argentina and Mexico, the new series are linked to
the BHW series at 1870.

2b. Five additional pre-1865 countries:
In all cases but China, Pm is taken to be the British "Merchandise Price Indices" for
exports given in Mitchell, Abstract of British Historical Statistics (Cambridge 1962), pp.
331-2. The 1813 observation is unavailable so has been taken as the average of 1812 and
1814. Px was constructed using prices of each country’s major exports, weighted by
export shares. The export weights are variable over the given base years.
Ceylon 1782-1913: Px construct as weighted average of coffee, tea (M. G. Mulhall, The
Dictionary of Statistics, London: Routledge, 1892, 491-5) and rubber prices (Historical
Statistics of the United States 1975). The export weights for 1782-1838 are those
observed for 1839-48, while the rest of the variable weights are interpolated between the
benchmarks 1839-48, 1878-82, 1898-1902 and 1920-24.
China 1782-1913: Px constructed as a weighted average of beans/bean products, cotton,
silk, tea (Mulhall: 471-6) and tea prices (Historical Statistics of the United States). The
export weights for 1782-1791 are those observed for 1792, while the rest of the variable
weights are interpolated between observations for 1792, 1833, 1867-71, 1878-82, 18981902 and 1920-24. China’s import price index = Po*wo + Pm*(1-wo) where Po is opium
prices and wo is the share of imports that were opium.
The Philippines 1782-1913: Px constructed as a weighted average of hemp, sugar,
wood, coffee, tobacco, indigo (Mulhall: 471-5) and copra prices (as a proxy, food prices
from Historical Statistics of the United States). The export weights for 1782-1840 are
those observed for 1841, while the rest of the variable weights are interpolated between
1841, 1889, 1893, 1899-1903 and 1920-24.
50

Russia 1782-1913: Px constructed as a weighted average of grain, flax, hemp, linseed,
wood, wool (Mulhall: 471-5), petroleum, meat (Sauerbeck 1886, 1893, 1909, 1930) and
textile prices (Historical Statistics of the United States). The export weights for 17821792 are those observed for 1793-5, while the rest of the variable weights are interpolated
between 1793-5, 1878-82, 1898-1902 and 1913.
Siam 1782-1913: Px constructed as a weighted average of rice, tin, cotton, sugar
(Mulhall: 471-5), rubber (Historical Statistics of the United States) and hide prices
(Sauerbeck 1886, 1893, 1909, 1930). The export weights 1782-1849 are those observed
for 1850, while the rest of the variable weights are interpolated between 1850, 1865-7,
1870-82, 1888-92, 1898-1902 and 1920-24.
