    "abstract": "\n\nIn many models, economic growth is driven by people discovering new ideas. These models typically assume either a constant or a growing population. However, in high income countries today, fertility is already below its replacement rate: women are having fewer than two children on average. It is a distinct possibility \u2014 highlighted in the recent book, \u201cEmpty Planet\u201d \u2014 that global population will decline rather than stabilize in the long run. What happens to economic growth when population growth turns negative?\n\n",
