The Macroeconomics of Exchange—Rate and Price Level Interactions:
Empirical Evidence for West Germany

ABSTRACT

This paper studies the evidence on the conditional covariances between the
German wholesale price level and the Deutsche mark exchange rste in the short
run and in the long run. I rely both on an unreatricted time-series model, and
on a structural Musse-Dornbusch model. The resulta from unrestricted estimates
indicate that the volatility of change. in the noainal exchange rate much exceed
the volatility of the inflation rate both in the short run and in the long run.
This implies a very high correlation between changes in the nominal and real
exchange rate, and a correlation between the inflation rate end changes in the
exchange rate that never exceeds .4- -with 95% probability. The results from the
structural estimates and sensitivity analysis indicate that perfect price
flexibility is strongly rejected, and that the modal tends to make sticky pricas
play a crucial role in explaining the evidence. Since the overidentifying
reatrictiona implied by the structural model are rejected, I conclude that we
still do not have a fully satisfactory explanation of observed extreme
sluggishness of aggregate price levels.

1. Jntroductioo
The joint dynamics

of

prices and exchange rates are at the core of open-

economy macroeconomic models. Exchange-rate fluctuations affect prices of
imported intermediate and final

goods,

wage formation, end hence coats of

production. Thus aggregate price dynamics are crucially influenced by exchangerate effects. At the same time, the dynsmic properties of the price level
determine the extent to which goods prices react to shocks in the asset markets
ad the extent to which these ahocks are reflected in exchange-rate fluctuations.

This paper uses date on West Germany to estimate and interpret the
covariation of the exchange rate and the prics level over different timehorizona. I follow the approach of Robert Flood [1981] , who pointed out a
number of empirical regularities, and asked which models best explain the

espirical facts. At the same time,

I

extend Flood's analysis by studying the

covariance between prices and exchange rates bosh in the short run and in the
long run, and by directly estimating the parameters of macro models to identify

more clearly the empirical limitations of existing theories. My

espirical

analysis concentrates on two main questions: the correlation between exchange
rates and prices, and the variance of nominal exchange rates and prices.
A number of authors have recently addressed the issue of exchange-rate

effects on aggregate price levels. The empirical evidence for the US ranges
from estimates of reduced-form equations (as Rudiger Dornbusch snd Stanley
Fischer [19861, Robert Cordon [1985]), to estimates of equations describing

fins' price-setting behavior (Wing Woo [1984]), and estimates of structural
equations (Jeffrey Sachs (1985]). These results, while highlighting important
correlations in the data, cannot be directly used for prediction purposes sainly

3

because of the endogeneity of the exchange rate. Forecasts of the comovententa
of the price level and the exchange rate based on reduced-form equations with
the exchange rate of the tight hand side are likely to be biased. Similarly,
the evidence from structural equations (estimated with instrumental variables

procedures) alone is not very useful for forecasting purposes: atructural
eatimatea yield different predictions depending on the rest of the macroeconomy,

and, once again, on the nature of exogenous shocks. Predictions on the
comovetnents of the exchange rate and the price level over time can only be made

after estimating all of the relevant feedbacks between these two variables, and
the typical coverience matrix of exogenous diaturbances: this ia the main
objective of this paper.

While unrestricted statistical models can provide unbiased eacimates of
covariance of prices and exchange rates over time, they cannot be used to
falsify sticky- or flexible-prices theories of exchange-rate dynamics, because. -

under

certain conditions--both families of models yield similar predictions.

For this reason I eatimate a structural model which subsumes both flexible- and
sticky-pricea as special cases, end use structural parameters' estimates to
interpret che evidence from unrestricted regressions.

In section 2 I outline the basic channels that effect the comovements of
prices and exchange rates with a macro model that emphasizes price aetting by

monopolistic competitors. The model alao serves to identify the variables that
form my dataset, whoee trend properties I analyze in section 3.

In section 4 1

study the covariance matrix of prices and exchange ratsa in the short run and in
the long run, obtained from an unrestricted vector autoregression (VAR) that

includes the time series in section 3. To interpret the evidence, in section

4
I estimate the parameters of the modal of section 2, and teat the restrictions
it imposes on the data. The model implies a number of constraints on the

vector-autoregressive representetion of the variables in the system: this
constrained VAR is used to compute another set of dynamic covsriance matrices of

prices snd exchange rates, which I compare to the unrestricted ones. Section 6
contains a summery of the results and some concluding remarks.

2,Prjce LayaLand_Exchsnze Rste Linkages: A Benchmark Model
Sachs (1985] lists three major effects of exchange-rate changes on the

price level:1 the cojenetitiveness effect, the direct effect, and the g&
inflation effect. The first arises from shifts in the demand for domestic
output associated with exchange-rate fluctuations. A depreciation of the
exchange rate, other things equal, increases demend for domestic output, end
leads to an increase in prices, to the extent that supply equations are upward

eloping. The direct effect arises from the use of imported intermediate goods
in the production of domestic output: an increase in the price of foreign
currency incresses domestic-currency costs of production, and is-S in pert--

pasaed through into higher output prices. Finally, the wage inflation effect
works though the determination of nominal wages and their effect on production

costa. An exchange-rate deprecietion increeses the price of imported

consumption goods, and brings about an increase in nominal wages:2 these
increases in costs of production sri also passed though into higher output
prices.

I capture the three effects by assuming that the economy is populated by
many monopolistic competitive firma, all with identical technology and demand

functions, and all producing differentiated goods.3 The demand function for
good i is, in loga:

These effects are proportional to the terms in the coefficient of e in
equation 3. fi(l-AYv represents the competitiveness effect: with upward sloping
supply, fi>O, and demand shifts by the elaeticity times the weight of foreign
goods in domestic consumption. a2 represents the direct effect: the share of
imported intermediate goode in domestic production. (l-A)a1 is the wage
inflation effect: given the real wage, an increase in the exchange rate brings
about an increase in costs proportional to the share of imported goods in the
consumption deflator, times the share of labor in total coats. Exchange-rate
changes have an additional effect on goads demand, through the deflator for
real balances, represented by the term -d(l-A) in the coefficient of e.
6 In the econometric estiaation that follows, I assume that the real consumption
wage is only affected by innovations in the other forcing variables in the
model, but is not affected by demand, productivity, or velocity shocka.
However, the real oroduct wage is endogenous.

would charge the aame profit-maximizing prices.

To allow for the presence of price stickiness, I specify a price dynamics
equation derived from Rotemberg (1982]:

—

cp1 +

+ (lcpc)i

where c represents a cost of price adjustment- -a parameter that can be

estimated, and p is a conatant discount factor. c is a transformation of the
quadratic cost of price adjustment of Rotemberg [1982] :

if C stands for

Rotemberg's coat of price adjustment, c—C/(l+(l+p)C].7 Equation (4) implies
that the current price charged by firm I ia a weighted average of the discounted

value of the price it expects to charge at time t+l, tt+l' of last period's
price, and of

With c—0 the model implies perfect price flexibility. The

aggregate version of (4) is equivalent to the wage dynamics equation of Taylor
(1980] ,

as parametrized by Cuillariso Calvo (1983] to modal staggered price

setting.8 Notice that the larger the coat of changing prices c, the smaller is
the effect of currant information on the current price level.

Finally, the feedback from the price level to the exchange rate is modelled
after Robert Mundall (1968], J. Marcus Fleming (1962], Michael Mussa [1976] and
Dornbusch [1976]: 1 assume that the exchange rate is forward-looking, and is

Thus c ranges between 0 and l/(l+p). Equation (4) is a first order condition
from firms' value maximization problem, where profits depend both on the jygj

Changes in

affect money market equilibrium both through the deflator for real

balances and through aggregate demand: thus the contemporaneous feedback from

the price level to the exchange rate ia ambiguous)0
For the purpose of studying the covariance of prices and exchange rates
over tire, knowledgs of the parameters in the model above is clearly not enough.

We need to compute the reduced form of the system in (l)-(6), and estimate the
typical pattern of disturbances affecting the economy, since, as is well known,

the covariance of endogenous variables in a model depends on the source of

exogenous shocks. A few preliminary observations however, can be usefully made
without explicitly writing down the full solution of the model. To simplify the

exposition, and without loss of generality, let for the moment p be constant
and equal to zero. Then the following identity relates the variance of the real

exchange rate--defined as epdthe variance of the price level, the variance of
the nominal exchange rate, and the correlation between exchange rates and
prices:

Var(pd) —

The identity in (7) says that the variance of the nominal price level is small
when the variance of the real and noainal exchange rate are of similar

magnitudes, and the coveriance between the nominal exchange rate and the price

level is small. Further manipulation of (7) shows that in this case the
correlation between the nominal and the real exchange rate is large.
Conversely, the correlation between the nominal exchange rate and the price
level is large, when the variance of the real exchange rate is small re].4tive to
the variance of the nominal exchange rate and of the price level.

It is illuminating to discuss the covariance of prices and exchange rates
in the two caaea where prices are perfectly flexible -c—O- -and where prices are

sticky--c>O. When c—O, the real exchange rate can be solved for from the
equilibrium in the goods market, and is a function of real variables affecting

demand and cost functions. The nominal exchange rate is in turn determined in
the asset markets, after solving forward the difference equation implicit in
(5). If, again for simplicity, the forcing variables follow the same firatorder stochastic process the exchange-rate equation would be:

11 Since these real variables ere determined independently of the nominal
exchange rate. I can use the semi-reduced form as in equation (8) for the
purpose of this exposition. A real exchange rete depreciation has
conflicting effects on equilibrium output, since it increases demand, but at
the same time it increases marginal costs throug)i the wage inflation
effect, r thus tending to reduce supply.

market shocks that depreciate the real exchange rate either do not affect output
significantly or decrease output, and if the variance of exogenous shocks in the
money market is small relativ, to the variance of the real exchange rate, then
the nominal and the real exchange rate are positively correlated, and, from
equation (7) the variance of the price level is smaller than the variance of the

exchange rate. This result was pointed out by Flood (1981], and Maurice
Obstfeld and Alan Stockman [19851,12 The aticky'prices model yields similar
predictiona, but for entirely different reasons. Sticky nominal prices imply a
smsll vsriance of the price level in the short-run, and, aa a result, a high
correlation of the nominal and the real exchange rate,

Therefore flexible and sticky-prices models can yield similar predictions
on the comovements of prices and exchange rates over time, and cannot be

falsified simply by the analysis of unrestricted estimates. For this reason in
the next section 1 will both offer unrestricted evidence, and attempt to
interpret this evidence using structural estimates.

activity are, respectively, the OECD consumption price index, and the OECD
industrial production index. The Deta Appendix reports all details necessary to
reconstruct the data set in this paper.

One aajor issue to be faced in the estiaation regards the trend properties

of the data. As is well known)3 most macroeconomic time series have very high
eutocorrelation coefficients, such that they cannot he statistically

distinguished from univariete random walks. Table 1 preeents tests of the
hypothesis that each individual series can be represented as a stationary
process in the first differences. The two columns on the left report stetistics

for the hypothesis I4:#—O £—l, in the following univariste model:

—

•, +

#it + E1Xt 1 + &2(XtiXt2) +

+ $4(Xt ( 4) +

where DC is the log of each series in the dataset, and t is e linear time trend.

The statistic for the null hypothesis is algebraically identicsl to the F
statistic for that linear constreint in en ordinery-least-squares rsgression.

Its distribution is reported by David Dickey and Wayne Fuller [1981). For all
variables except q* the null hypothesie is not rejected st the 95 percent

confidence level. In the case of

percent level. Table 1 siso reports Jsmes Stock snd Msrk Watson's [1986)

13

reject the null hypothesis. Thus the univariete tests in table 1 suggest that
all series need to be differenced to achieve stationarity.

First-differencing all variables is not appropriate, however, when some of

them sre cointegraced. This happens when while individusl time series ere nonstationary certain linear combinations of them are stationary. In the model
illustrated in section 2 end 3 cointegrstion arises if, for example, demand and

productivity disturbences were stationary stochastic processes. Then the
reduced form expressions for d and e would contain stationary disturbances,
indicating that the exchange rate, the price level, and the other variables in
the model have (in the terminology of Stock snd Watson (1986)) common stochastic

trends, Similarly, the forcing variables in the model might have common
stochastic trenda. Robert Engle and Cliwe Granger [1987) have shown that, in
the presence of cosmion stochastic trends,15 the vector-autoregressive

representations that this paper relies on sre inappropriate. I perform tests co
detect the presence of comaon stochastic trends, in several different groupings

of the variables in the dataset. These teats, due to Stock and Watson [1986)
are based on the eigenvelues of certain coefficient matrices in the common-trend

representation of the series in each grouping. When the number of common trenda
is leas than the number of variables, these coefficient matrices have rank that
is smaller then the number of variables.

Table 2 reports the results. The column on the right shows that the null
hypothesis that the number of cosunon trends equals the number of variables ia

common, their multivariate representation is cointegreted, as defined by
Engle and Granger [1987).

14

not rejected at the 95 percent confidence level for all groupe in the table,

except in the case of k and q* In that case, the null hypothesis would not be
rejected at 97.5 percent or higher levels. Notice that the teat for the absence
of a common stochastic trend among final-goods prices and the nominal exchange
rate is not rejected, i.e. the real exchange rate follows a random walk

according to the date. Although John Huiringa [1987] finds some evidence of
stationarlty in his own real exchange rate data, he reports a very slow rate of
mean reversion.

16

in conclusion, the evidence presented in this section suggests that first-

differencing all the data appears to be en acceptable procedure to achieve
stationarity, and that consistent estimates parametere of both the unreetricted
and the restricted model could be recovered using differenced data.17

Evidence that the real exchange rate is approximated by a random walk does
not, per Se, invalidate the hypothesis that prices are sticky. If the
determinants of the long-run equilibrium exchange rate follow random walk
proceaaes, so would the real exchange rate. See Stockman [1987] for a
discussion of the implications of alternative theorias on the behavior of the
real exchange rate, and Kenneth West (1987] for an example where near-random
walk behavior of real variables is actually induced by the presence of sticky
prices.

17 Nelson and Neejoon Kang [1981] discuss the problems arising vhen random walks
are detrended with linear non-stochastic trends. In a small sample, tests of
difference-stationarity have little power against a trend-stationary model
where the indetersiinistic component has an autoregressive coefficient
arbitrarily close to 1. This problem is raised by Nelson and Plosser [1982]
and is discussed by Bennet Mccallum 11986]. See also Paul Sajeuelaon [19761
for a critical discussion of the random walk asaumption. The main results of
this paper turn out to be unaffected by the method used to achieve
stationarity.

Excheriee Rate: Unrestricted Estimates

In this section I present empirical evidence on the Joint dynamics of
inflation rates end changes in the exchange rate base on an unrestricted
statistical model which includes all variables appearing in sections (2) and
(3). The model i5 compactly written as follows:

vector x contains, for eech varisble, a number of lags squal to the order of the

autoregression ninus 1. The order of the VAR is chosen to minimize residual
variance, and any systemetic autocorrelation of residuals.

Using (8) recursively, I write the deviation of variables in x from their
conditional expectation, £ periods ahead:

Then I use (9) to derive the

cxt+A_ C1x]x1- 01x3 —

GZ(G

(11)

where E is the contemporaneous covsriance mstrix of the u's. If the system is

16

stable, the eigenvalues of the matrix C are less than I in modulus, and the
covariance .eatricee converge to a given ateady-etate value. Equation (11)

provides the conditional coveriance matrix of eli variables in the model over
different time horizons, given the estimated reduced form equation, and the

estimated typical pattern of exogenous shocks. It thus takes into account the
simultsneous determination of endogenoua variables, as well as their dependence

on the different underlying shocks. The relevant dynamics are induced by the
powers of the matrix C.

Table 3 contains summary statistics for the system (9). I have chosen to
estimate a fifth-order VAR because of the relatively large number of variables

entering the system. The reaulta I report below would be very little affected
by the number of lagged variables included in each equation. The estimates of
the matrix C and the coveriance matrix of innovations S are then applied
recursively as in equation (11) to compute the conditional covariance matrix

between the exchange rate and the price level over time. I concentrate on the
standard error of the inflation rate, the standard error of the change in the
nominal exchange rate, the correlation between the inflation rate and changes in
the nominal exchange rate, and the correlation between changes in the nominal
and the real exchange rate,
For all, of these statistics I compute 90 percent confidence bounds

following Bradley Efron's [1982) "bootstrap" method:18 Given the estimates of C,

18 This appears more appropriate then the normal approximation since these
statistics are highly nonlinear functions of the original parameters, as
suggested by equation (11). See David Runkle [1986] for a discussion and an
application to a similar context.

17

I get an estimate of T disturbance vectors u in equation (9) where T is the
size of the original sample. I attach probability l/T to each estimated u. and
generate 300 artificial samples of x, by drawing from the estimsted U's and
applying recursively equation (9), conditional on the initial estimates of C,

and the sample realization of X.

For each artificial sample, I reestimate all

parameters, together with the statistics of interest here. These empirical
distributions are used to compute confidence bounds.

Figure 1 plots the 90 percent confidence bounds for the standard errors of
the inflation rate and of the change in the nominal exchange rete from 1 to 24

months ahead)9 Standard errors are expressed in percent per snnuis. The figure
highlights the most important feature of the data, namely, as noted by Flood
(1981) end others, the volatility of the (changes in the) nominal exthange rate

much exceeds the volatility of the inflation rate. The standard error of the
inflation rate ranges from 1.19 to 1.499 on a 1-month horizon and from 2.28 to
3.10 on a 24-month horizon.

By' contrsst, the standard error of the change in

the nominal exchange rate ranges from 10.63 to 13.34 on a 1-month horizon, and
from 14.82 to 18.15 on a 24-month horizon. Thus the difference in volatility
between the nominal price level and the nominal exchange rate is not just a
short-run phenomenon, but is also present in the long-run, unconditional

estimates.2° Figure 2, which plots the confidence hounds for the correlation

the finding

of figure 1: the correlation between the real and the nominal exchange rate
exceeds 99 percent (with 95 percent probability), both in the short run and in
the long run, although it appears to be higher at higher frequencies.

Figure 3 plots the correlation between the inflation rate and changes in
the nominal exchange rate: the correlations range between 10 and 40 percent in
the long run. This result suggests the importance of fluctuations of the real
exchange rate, which prevent prices and exchange rates from moving more closely
together even in the long run,

4. Evidence F row the Structural Model
In this section I estimate the parameters of the model in section 2, and
use them to interpret the evidence based on the unrestricted time-series model
of the previous section.
I estimate a system that includes the eggregete demand equation (6), the

money demand equation (5), and the equetion describing equilibrium price

dynamics (4)--after aggregation across firms i, and solving for dt' which
equals a constant times marginal costs. The three equations are estisated
jointly, by replacing the conditional expectations of the future price level and
exchange rate with their actual realizations. This procedure, as Robert Cumby,
Huizinga and Obstfeld 11983] argue, produces composite disturbances in the price
dynamics and output demand equations, that are the sum of the structural
disturbances and future surprises: thus the disturbances in the price dynamics

19

and money demand equations follow a first-order moving-average process. By
applying the generalized instrumental variables method of Tars Hanaen (19821

Hansen and Kenneth Singleton (1982] and Cumby-Huizinga-Obetfeld [1983], I take
into account both the first order moving-average process of the disturbances,
and the possible presence of conditional heteroskedaaticity in the disturbances.

Table 4 reports the results. The estimation was carried out assuming given
values of A (the share of domestic goods in the consumption deflator), p (the
rate of discount of firms' profits), and a1 end 02 (the shares of labor and
imported intermediates in the aggregate production function), and using lagged
values of the forcing variables as instruments. All parameters, except ft an d,
sre significantly different from zero and of the expected sign. Since ft

is

insignificantly different from zero, the hypothesis of constant returns to scale

cannot be rejected. The point estimates of the elasticity of demand for
domestic output y and of the output elasticity of money demand a are quite high-4.3 and 1,8 respectively--but are not significantly different from lower, and

more reasonable, values. Finally, the most notable result of table 4 is the
size and significance of c, the parameter representing the cost of changing

prices: its value of 0.48 is more than 30 standard errors away from 0, leading
to a strong rejection to the flexible-prices version of the modal.

The table also reports autocorreletions of the estimated disturbances at

different lags. Although we still do not know the distribution of these
statistics, it is useful to compare them to the what the thoretical model

predicts. While--as Cumby, Huizings and Obetfeld (1983] show--the model
predicts high values for the first order sutocorrelation coefficients in the
price-dynamics and money demand equations, it does not impose any a priori

20

restriction on the value of the autcorrelation coefficients in the output demand

equation. The table shows, contrary to the predictions of the model, that the
autocorrelation coefficients in the price dynamics equation remain quite high

after the first lag. In the money demand equation it is alec hard to detect a
drop of the autocorrelation coefficient after the first lag. Finally, the
estimated disturbances in the output demand equation do not display any
particular pattern or high values.
As Hansen [1982] pointed out, the model and the rational expectations

assumption jointly imply overidentifying restrictions that can be tested. The
restrictions are that the inner products of the instruments and the disturbances
in excess of the estimated parameters should be close to zero according to a

certain metric. Hansen's J ststistic, reported in Table 4, is distributed as
with

degrees of freedom equal to the number of instrumente times the number of

equations, less the number of parametere to be estimated. The value of the

statistic implies a rejection of the null

hypothesis at high

confidence levels.

Thus while there is apparently strong evidence against the flexible-prices
version of the model, suggesting that the differences in volatility of prices
and exchange rates in the short run might not be dua exclusively to real shocks,
the sticky-model is also not fully consistent with the evidence.

The rejection of oweridentifying restrictions, however, does not indicate
where the sticky-prices model fails in explsining the comoveisents of exchange

rates and prices. For this reason. I compute the restrictions imposed by the
sticky-prices model on the reduced-form (9), and derive the resulting dynamic

covariance matrices betwsen d and e, which I compare with the unrestricted

21

ones. To obtain these restrictions, I solve to eliminate output from the system
of three equations whose estimates are reported in table 4, and obtain a system

of difference equations in d and a. These equations •sre solved using the nowstandard methods outlined by Hansen and Thomas Sargent (1980L which involve the
assumption that agents know the stochastic processes of the forcing variables,

and use this knowledge to form expectations about their future paths, based on

past realizations of these variables. The result is a system of linear

equations in d'

and the seven forcing variables, with nonlinear constraints

across the coefficients of the vector-autoregressions of the forcing variables
(which I estimate again including 5 lags for each variable)21 and the

coefficients of the reduced froms of

Where x was defined above, The matrix F has nonzero elements, since

According to the model, lagged values of prices and the exchsnge rate are not

(I-fl

The covariancea between d and e can now be computed as in equation (11). The
results of these calculations are reported in figures 4 and 5. Figure 4 plota
the correlation between changes in the nominal and the real exchange rate, and,

for reference, the 90% confidence bounds obtained from the unrestricted model.
While the correlation between changes in the nominal and real exchange rate
implied by the restricted sodel also exceed .9 over all time horizons they are
clearly outaide the confidence region implied by the unrestricted model. As
theory predicts, the restricted correlation between nominal and real exchange
rates changes is highest in the short run, and declines with the length of the

horizon. The difference between the restricted and unrestricted estimates is
also apparent in the estimates of the relative magnitudes of the standard errors

of inflation rates and exchange rate changes.22 While in the case of the
unrestricted estimates the ratio of the standard error of the exchange-rate
change and the rate of inflation ranges from 7.1-11.2 (1-month ahead) to 4.8-8.0
(24-months ahead), the same ratio implied by the constrained model ranges from

3.7 (1-month ahead) to 2.4 (24-aontba ahead). Thus the model I estimate implies
a larger relative volatility of the rate of inflation, than what is observed in
the data. Finally, figure $ plots the correlation between the inflation rate

and the changes in the nominal exchange rste. The figure shows that the
unrestricted estimates fall within the 90% confidence bounds implied by the

the standard 'errors of prices and exchange rates are much smaller when
computed from the unrestricted estimates.

23

model. It also shows that the correlation between exchange-rate changes and the
infletion rate tends to increase with maturity: in other words, the restricted
model tends to ascribe some of the short-run variability of the reel exchange
rate to short-run nominal rigidities.

The role of short-run nominal rigidities can also be aseeaaed hy performing

sensitivity analysis. Decreasing c froe .48 to .1 increases the correlation
between the inflation rate and changes in the nominal exchange rate to .76 in
the 1-month horizon and .85 in the 24-month horizon. Furthermore, the variance
of the nominal price level actually exceeds the variance of the nominal exchange

rate in this case. Thus the model tends to ascribe a very important role to
price stickines in explaining the observed cosiovements of exchange rates and
prices.

6. Summary of the Evidence and Concludinz Rejuarica

Thia paper has studied the evidence on the conditional covariances of
(changes in) the German wholesale price index and the Deutsche mark exchange

rate. The results from unrestricted estimates indicate that the volatility of
changes in the nominal exchange rate much exceed the volatility of the inflation

rate both in the short run and in the long run. This implies a very high
correlation between nominal and real exchange rate changes. A high volatility
of the real exchange rate is also associated with a relatively low long-run
correlation between the inflation rate and exchange-rate changes, which--with

24

95% probability- -never exceeds .4.

both sticky- and flexible-prices models could be consistent with these

results. In order to offer an intepretation of the evidence, I estimate a
Musss-Dornbusch structural model, that allows for s wide variety of real shocks-including shocks in productivity, demand, real wagee, fiscal policy, and real
imported-materials prices- -and allows to test perfect price flexibiiity as a

nested hypothesis. Most of the estimated parameters are significant and of
reasonable magnitudes. The hypothesis of perfect price flexibility is rejected

with a t

statistic

of 34. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis shows that the

estimated model tends to ascribe a crucial role to price stickiness in the

pattern of covariances of the exchange rate and the price level. At the same
time, however, the overidentifying restrictions are soundly rejected.

Rejections of the overidentifying restrictions do not indicste the source
of misspecification: by computing the dynamic covariance matrices between the
inflation rate and changes in the exchange rate implied by the modal, I show
that the model predicts a higher volatility of the inflation rste, relative to
the volatility of the nominal exchange rate, than what is actually observed in
the data.
These results should be strong enough to persuade empirical researchers to

look for an explanations of the observed sluggishness of the aggregate price

level. On one hand, the real side of the model could be enriched, in a way to
make shocks have a larger impact on the real exchange rate. This might give
less of a crucial role to price stickiness es en explanation of the evidence.

25

On the other hand, recent theoretical models of costly price adjustment23 might
lead to estpirical applications that fit the data more satisfactorily.
