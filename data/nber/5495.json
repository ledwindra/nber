The results show that although the domestic content of Japanese firms is rising, differences are not being eliminated completely.  Also, the apparent elasticity of substitution is lower for Japanese than for U.S. firms.  These results suggest that although transplant production may reduce the U.S. automotive deficit with Japan, transplant production will not cause its elimination.\n\n",
