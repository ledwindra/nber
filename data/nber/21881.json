    "abstract": "\n\nI decompose Virginia\u2019s paper money into expected real-asset present value, risk discount, and transaction premium or \u201cmoneyness\u201d value. The value of Virginia\u2019s paper money was determined primarily by its real-asset present value. The transaction premium was small. Positive risk discounts occurred in years when treasurer malfeasance was suspected. Virginia\u2019s paper money was not a fiat currency, but a barter asset, with just enough \u201cmoneyness\u201d value to make it the preferred medium of exchange for local transactions. Compared with alternative models, my decomposition model of inside monies is superior conceptually and statistically for explaining the performance of American colonial paper monies.\n\n",
