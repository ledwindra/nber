DO MINIMUM WAGES REDUCE EMPLOYMENT?
A CASE STUDY OF CALIFORNIA, 1987-89

ABSTRACT
In July 1988 California's minimum wage rose from $3.35 to

$4.25. In the previous year, 11 percent of California workers
and fully one-half of its teenage workers earned less than the

new state minimum. The state-specific nature of the California
increase provides a valuable opportunity to study the effects of

minimum wage legislation. As in a conventional non-experimental
program evaluation, labor market trends in other states can be
used to infer what would have happened in California in the

absence of the law. Drawing on published labor market statistics
and microdata samples from the Current Population Survey, I apply
this strategy to estimate the effects of the rise in the minimum

wage on various groups and industries in the state. Special
attention is paid to teenage workers and employees in retail

trade. The results are striking. The increase in the minimum
raised wages of teenagers and other low wage workers by 5-10

percent. Contrary to conventional predictions, however, the
employment rate of teenage workers rose, while their school
enrollment rate fell.

Do Minimum Wages Reduce Employment?
A Case Study of California, 1987-89

Few substantive issues generate as much agreement among economists as

the effects of minimum wage legislation. It is widely believed that the
imposition of a binding wage floor will reduce the employment of young and

less-skilled workers. While the theoretical arguments underlying this
consensus are simple and compelling, the empirical evidence is surprisingly

limited.' A major obstacle confronting most recent studies of minimum wage
laws is the near-universality of the Federally-legislated minimum. Despite
some specific exceptions in the Federal law, the vast majority of workers

are covered by the same wage floor.2 Since the Federal minimum has been
adjusted only 11 times in the post-war era, the number of independent
observations on the effect of the minimum wage is small.
In the late 1980's, however, several States responded to the decadelong decline in the real value of the Federal minimum wage by establishing

state wage floors above the $3.35 per hour Federal rate. These statespecific increases provide a valuable natural experiment for evaluating the

effects of minimum wage statutes. Labor market trends in other states can
be used to infer what would have happened to employment, wages, and

unemployment in the absence of the law. The timing of the states'
legislation is also fortuitous. The late 1980's was a period of declining

Brown, Gilroy. and I(ohen (1982) present a detailed survey of the
empirical evidence up to 1980. See also the chapters of the Minimum Wage
Study Commission (1981).

At present roughly 85 percent of workers are covered by the Federal
law. The major exclusions are employees of smaller retail trade and
service establishments, employees paid on commission, and employees who
earn tips (who are covered by a subminimum rate). Many states (including
California) have historically maintained state minimum wage rates equal to
the Federal rate for workers outside the Federal law -- see Questor (1981).

unemployment, with modest rates of wage and price inflation. In a stable
economic environment like this the effects of minimum wage laws are more
likely to stand out from other changes in the labor market.

Among the states that raised their minimum wages California enacted

the most notable change. In July 1988 California's minimum wage rose from
$3.35 to $4.25 per hour. In the previous year 11 percent of all workers in
the state and 50 percent of California teenagers earned between $3.35 and

$4.24 per hour. Furthermore, the California law applied very broadly,
extending even to tipped employees in the food and drink industry.
Estimates presented by Brown, Cliroy, and Kohen (1982) suggest that teenage
employment would fall by 3-8 percent in response to this rise in the
minimum wage.

This paper uses rnicrodata from the Current Population Survey (CPS) to

measure the effects of the increase in the California minimum wage. The
available samples are large: about 20,000 individuals of working age and

1500 teenagers per year. These data, together with data for a comparison
sample of individuals drawn from other states with no change in minimum
wage laws, permit relatively precise inferences on the effects of the
increased minimum.

I tabulate the relative changes in wages, employment,

and unemployment for a variety of age-ethnic-education groups in the state
and compare the magnitude of these changes to the fraction of the group who

earned less than $4.25 in the year before the law was enacted. I also
devote special attention to two heavily affected groups: teenage workers

and employees in retail trade. Remarkably, I find no evidence that the
rise in the minimum had an adverse employment effect. Indeed, the evidence

3

suggests that the increase in the minimum wage raised both wages and
employment among low-wage workers in the state.

I. A grief History

The rise in California's minimum wage in mid-1988 followed a year-long

sequence of legislative, administrative, and judicial decisions.3 In May
1987, the State Assembly's Labor and Employment Commission voted to raise

the minimum from $3.35 to $4.25 per hour effective January 1 1988, with

further increases in 1989 and 1990. The bill was subsequently modified and
passed both houses of the legislature with the provision of a single

increase, to $4.25, effective January 1988. The governor vetoed the bill
in September 1987, citing the pending decision of the State's Industrial

Welfare Commission. Under California law, this commission is empowered to
set minimum wages for all workers in the state. The Commission had begun
hearings on a new minimum in 1986, and in December 1987 announced an
increase in the minimum wage to $4.25, effective July 1 1988.

The Industrial Welfare Commission's ruling also established a
subminimum rate of $3.50 per hour for tipped employees. This provision was
immediately appealed by the California Labor Federation, which contended

that the lower rate violated the California Labor Code. An appellate court
panel ruled against the subminimum in June 1988. The July 1 effective date
therefore passed amid much confusion as to the appropriate minimum wage for

tipped employees. The issue was resolved on October 31 1988, when the
State Supreme Court upheld the lower court and rejected the subminimum

3The following information is gleaned from articles in the aureau of
National Affairs' Daily Labor Report, including 1987 DLR 157: A-2, 1987 DLR
246: A-4, 1988 DLR 127: A-2, 1988 DLR 135: A-4, and 1988 DLR 215: A-4.

provision. Thus, by the end of 1988 the minimum wage was clearly
established at $4.25 per hour for all California workers, including tipped

employees. The only exemptions applied to individuals under 18 years of
age (who faced a $3.60 minimum), and to certain narrow occupations and
industries.

II. Characteristics of Low-Wage Workers in 1987

To understand the effects of the rise in the minimum wage in California
it is important to identify the sectors of the economy and the types of

workers affected by the law. Tables 1 and 2 give the industry distribution
and demographic characteristics of low-wage workers in the state in the

year before the increase in the minimum. The data are taken from merged

files of the 12 monthly CPS surveys conducted during l987. Each month,
one-quarter of all individuals in the CPS sample are asked to report their
usual weekly hours and usual hourly or weekly earnings on their main job.
For workers who are paid on a weekly or monthly basis I have converted
their earnings to an hourly basis by dividing usual weekly earnings by

usual weekly hours.5 Individuals are then sorted into categories depending
on whether their hourly wage is below the prevailing minimum of $3.35 in
1987, equal to the minimum in 1987, or above $3.35 but less than the 1988
minimum of $4.25 per hour.

In 1987 1.3 percent of California workers reported an hourly wage less

than $3.35 per hour (see column 2 of Table 1). The characteristics of

4The CPS samples are described in Appendix 1.
have not used the wage or earnings data for individuals whose wage
or earnings responses are imputed by the Census Bureau.

5

these workers are reported in column 2 of Table 2. Since California law
prescribed a minimum

of

$3.35 for most workers not covered by the Federal

statute, some of these individuals were presumably working illegally for

non-complying employers.6 Others, including some 16 and 17 year olds and
some live-in household workers, legally earned less than the Federal/state

minimum.7 A third group of subminimum-wage workers consists of salaried
workers who mis-report their usual weekly earnings or usual hours.8 The
importance of this phenomenon is suggested by the fact that salaried
workers are 3 times more likely to report a subminimum wage than hourly-

rated workers, even though (on average) salaried workers have substantially
higher earnings than hourly-rated workers.

A much larger group of individuals were paid either exactly $3.35 per

hour or between $3.36 and $4.24 per hour. For simplicity I will refer to
these workers as the "affected group", since it is precisely these workers

who would have either lost their jobs or had their wages raised if the new

minimum had taken effect in l987. Overall, 10.8 percent of California
workers were paid as much as the old minimum but less than the new minimum.

6For example, non-compliance is a likely explanation for the
relatively large number of workers in low-wage manufacturing industries
paid less than $3.35 per hour. See Ashenfelter and Smith (1979) for an
analysis of the extent of non-compliance with Federal minimum wage
legislation in the early 1970's.

7Under California law, meals and lodgings may be credited for part of
the minimum wage.
8Survey measures of earnings and hours are well known to contain
substantial response errors: see Duncan and Hill (1985). In addition, I
suspect that some full-time workers (or their proxy respondents) overstate
their hours by reporting exactly 40 hours per week.
9This ignores non-compliance and the fact that some workers who are
paid at or above the minimum are actually exempt. It also ignores the
possibility that job conditions are altered when the wage is raised.

6

The size of the affected group varies substantially across industries,
ranging from less than 2 percent of workers in mining, construction,
transportation, communications and utilities, and public administration to
30 percent or more in agriculture, low-wage manufacturing, and retail

trade. The industry distribution of the affected group is presented in
column 6 of Table 1. About one-half of these workers are concentrated in
retail trade. In view of this fact, I devote special attention to this
industry in Section IV, below.

The demographic characteristics of wage earners in the affected group

are presented in column 3 of Table 2. Relative to the overall California
workforce the affected group is younger and contains more women, Hispanics,

and school enrollees. Affected wage earners also work fewer hours per
week. The age distribution of affected workers is highly skewed: over 80
percent are between the ages of 16 and 24. Indeed, 52 percent of
California teenagers and 29 percent of those between 20 and 24 years of age
reported wages in the $3.35 -

$4.24 range in 1987.

The family income data in Table 2 suggest that the low hourly earnings

of affected workers are associsted with low family income. The income
measure here pertains to the 12 month period ending 4 months before the CPS

interview)0 Some 44 percent of affected wage earners live in families
with annual incomes less than $15,000. By comparison, 24 percent of all

10Family income is collected on the CPS "Control Card" when a
household first enters the CPS survey. The income information is collected
in 14 intervals and is updated at the 5th interview (which takes place 12
months after the first interview). A detailed description of the nature of
this income measure is provided in the 1987 Bureau of the Census document
"How to Enumerate CPS", pp. D3 64-67. I have constructed the average income
figures in Table 2 by assigning to each interval the mean level of family
income last year among currently employed individuals in the March 1988 CPS
who report family income in the same interval.

7

Californians age 16-68 and 19 percent of employed individuals live in such

families. A more detailed contrast is presented in Figure 1, which plots
the distribution functions of family income for low-wage earners and those

making more than $4.24 per hour. Despite their relative concentration in
the lower half of the family income distribution, there are still

significant numbers of low-wage workers in high-income families. Thus, as
Craralich (1976) and other researcher have emphasized, not all the earnings

increases generated by a rise in the minimum wage accrue to the poorest

families. Relative to earlier studies, however, the correlation between
low wage earnings and low family income is higher here.

II. The Effects of The Minimum
8.

Effects

op the Azre2ate Wage Distribution

California's new minimum wage took effect on July 1 1988. The first
question of interest is whether and by how much the increase in the minimum

raised wages at the low end of the earnings distribution. A partial answer
is provided by Figure 2, which plots the hourly wage distribution among

California workers earning less than $6.10 per hour in 1987 and 1989. This
cutoff captures the first quartile of the wage distribution: in both years

the 25th percentile of wages was $6.00 per hour. The figure indicates a
sharp decrease in the fraction of workers earning between $3.35 and $4.24 -

- from

10.8 percent in 1987 to 2.4 percent in 1989. The prominent spike at

11There are a several possible explanations for this. First, I
classify workers earning between $3.35 and $4.25 as affected workers, while
some earlier studies look only at those individuals earning exactly the
minimum wage. Second, relative to the 1970's, the real level of the
Federal minimum in 1988 was much lower. Finally, the joint distribution of
individual earnings and family income may have changed.

8

$3.35 per hour (with 11 percent of all workers in the first quartile of the
1987 wage distribution) is replaced by an even bigger spike at $4.25 per

hour (with 17.6 percent of all workers in the firBt quartile of the 1989
wage distribution).

Two

aspects

of the wage data in Figure 2 warrant further discussion.

First, although the 1989 wage distribution shows a relative deficit in the

$3.35-$4.24 range, a much higher fraction of workers earned less than the

minimum wage in 1989 than in 1987 (3.5 percent versus 1.3 percent). Using
Ashenfelter and Srniths (1979) notion of a non-compliance rate, 31 percent
of all workers earning less than or equal to the minimum wage in 1987

earned less than the minimum)2 With the rise in the minimum to $4.25 the
non-compliance rate rose to 46 percent.

One potential explanation is provided by California law, which permits
a 15 percent lower minimum wage for individuals less than 18 years of age
and for apprentices and job learners in the first 160 hours of
13

employment.

In 1987, the incidence of subminimum pay (i.e. less than

$3.35 per hour) was 9 percent among 16 and 17 year olds: these workers

accounted for 15 percent of subminimum earners. In 1989 the incidence of
subminimum pay (less than $4.25) rose to 17 percent among 16 and 17 year

olds. Nevertheless, their share of all subminimum employment actually fell
to 10 percent. While more employers may have used the youth sub-minimum in
the later period, this by itself cannot explain the rise in the incidence

non-compliance rate makes no allowance for measurement error or
for incomplete coverage of the law.
13During the school year the youth subminimum is only available to
one-fourth of the workforce at any particular establishment.

9

of below-minimum wages. In fact, the incidence of subminimum wages rose by
200-300 percent for most groups in the labor force.

A second issue in the interpretation of Figure 2 is the question of
whether some change in the distribution of wages would have occurred even

in the absence of a higher minimum. The median wage for all California
workers rose 7.6 percent between 1987 and 1989. Assuming a stable relative
wage structure, and assuming that the rate of growth of the median wage was
unaffected by changes in the minimum wage, this suggests that the fraction

of workers in the $3.35-$4.24 range would have fallen. On the other hand,
the 25th percentile of the wage distribution was the same in 1987 and 1989.

As noted in other studies, relative wages have been diverging over the
1980's, with much slower growth at the low end of the wage distribution

(See Blackburn, Bloom and Freeman (1989)). Using the 25th percentile as a
benchmark, one might not have expected much change in the lower tail of the
wage distribution between 1987 and 1989.14
A simple and more convincing way to evaluate what would have happened
in California in the absence of the new minimum is to examine comparable

wage distributions for workers in other states. To this end I have
constructed a "comparison sample" of workers from Florida, Georgia, New

Mexico. and Dallas Texas.'5 Ideally, one might have preferred to use
14

Nevertheless, the existence of spikes in the wage distribution
implies that relatively small changes in the wage distribution will not
necessarily affect specific percentiles, if the percentile happens to
coincide with a spike (as does the 25th percentile in this case).
15i have only used Dallas, rather than all of Texas, for two reasons.
First, during the late 1980's economic conditions in many parts of Texas
were severely affected by the slump in oil prices. A comparison sample
that included all of Texas would thus show "too slow" economic growth
between 1987 and 1989. Second, in comparison to California, a smaller
fraction of workers in most states live in large urban areas. Thus, by

10

states like Nevada, Oregon, and Washington to form a comparison group.
Following the lead of California, however, these states all raised their

minimum wage rates In late 1988 or 1989. Thus, I have drawn a comparison
sample from Southern and western states that did not change their state
minimum wage rates.

A descriptive summary of differences between the California sample and

the comparison sample is presented in Appendix 2. Sriefly, the comparison
group had virtually the same labor force participation, employment-

population, and unemployment rates as California in 1987. The two samples
also have fairly similar sex, age, and education distributions, although
the fraction of Hispanic workers is higher in California (20 percent versus
13 percent) as is the fraction of individuals who report their race as

neither white nor black (9.5 percent versus 2.5 percent). Despite these
similarities, average wage rates in the comparison sample are 20-25 percent

lower than wages in California. Not surprisingly then, the fraction of
workers earning between $3.35 and $4.24 in 1987 was higher in the
comparison sample --

12.8 percent versus 10.8 percent in California.

The median wage in the comparison sample rose 10 percent between 1987

and 1989. Over the same period the fraction of workers earning between
$3.35 and $4.24 fell by one-quarter, to 9.6 percent. If an equivalent
reduction had occurred in California, the fraction of workers in the $3.35-

$4.24 range would have been 8.1 percent in 1989. In fact, it was only 2.4
percent. On the basis of this comparison I conclude that the minimum wage
reduced the fraction of workers in the $3.35-$4.24 range by at least 5.7

including only workers in Dallas and Fort Worth, I increased the relative
fraction of urban workers in the comparison sample.

11

percentage points. On average, workers in this range earned $3.70 per hour
in 1987 (see Table 2). Assuming that the "displaced" workers earned $4.25
in 1989, the minimum wage law raised the wage 15 percent for roughly 6

percent of California's workers. This estimate is biased upward by any
losses of employment that occurred for workers in the affected wage group

(see below). It is biased downward, however, by any effect of the
increased minimum on wages of those who remained in the $3.35-$4.24 range
in 1989, or by any effect of the increased minimum on workers who earned

more than $4.25 in 1987.16

b. Effects on Emvlovment and Unemolovment
A first indication of the employment effects of the rise in the minimum
wage comes from a comparison of employment and unemployment trends in

California and the country as a whole after 1987. The unemployment rate in
California fell from 5.8 percent in 1987 to 5.1 percent in 1989. Over the

same period the national rate fell from 6.2 to 5.3 percent. Thus, trends
in the overall unemployment rate suggest similar or slightly slower

economic growth in California than elsewhere in the U.S. The same
conclusion emerges from an analysis of the overall employment-population
ratio, which gained 1.1 percentage points in California between 1987 and

1989 compared with 1.5 percentage points nationwide)7

16See Grossman (1983) for an analysis of the effects of minimum wage
increases on above-minimum wage workers.
17The standard error on the published unemployment rate for all
workers in California is about .15 percentage points, while the standard
error on the corresponding employment/population ratio is about .35 points.
Thus, the relative changes in the employment and unemployment rates for
California workers between 1987 and 1989 are not statistically significant.

12

For California teenagers, however, the pattern is quite different.
Between 1987 and 1989 teenage unemployment rates in California fell 3
percentage points (from 16.9 to 13.9 percent), while the average U.S. rate

fell only 1.9 percentage points (from 16.9 to 15.0 percent). An even
stronger relative trend is indicated by the teenage employment-population
ratio, which increased 4.1 percentage points in California (from 43.0 to
47.1 percent) compared to a 2 percentage point increase nationwide (from

45.5 to 47.5 percent).18 Since teenagers are the workers most likely
affected by an increase in the minimum wage, these responses are clearly

unexpected. Rather than an adverse employment effect, the data point
toward an increase in teenage employment in California following the rise
in the minimum wage.

I have also used published Bureau of Labor Statistics data to evaluate
changes in the employment/population ratio of California workers relative
to workers in the comparison sample of Florida, Georgia. New Mexico, and

Dallas Texas)9 Data for 1985-1989 are presented in Table 3. The pre-1987
data allow a simple check on the validity of the comparison sample as a
"control group" for California. If the comparison sample is a legitimate
control group there should be no trend in the pre-1987 gap between

California and the comparison sample. This specification test is clearly
satisfied for both the overall employment rate and the teenage rate. It is

18The standard error of the published annual unemployment rate for
California teenagers is approximately 1 percentage point, while the
standard error of the published teenage employment-population ratio is
approximately 1.3 percentage points.
19An important advantage of the published data is that they are
derived from the full CPS sample in each month, rather than the 1/4 sample
used in the rest of this paper.

13

also reassuring that the gap in the overall employment-population ratio

shows little change after 1987. For California teenagers, however, there
is a clear upward shift in the probability of employment after 1987.

Relative to teenagers in the comparison sample, the employment rate of
California teenagers was 4.8 percentage points higher in 1989 than in 1985-

87. Even with the relatively large sampling errors this change is
statistically significant, with a t-statistic of 2.18.
Table 4 turns to the available inicrodata to analyze the effects of the

minimum wage on specific age-ethnic-education groups. The groups have been
selected to yield at least 400 observations in California in each year.

The first column of the table gives the fraction of workers in each group

who earned between $3.35 and $4.24 in 1987. This measure of the potential
impact of the rise in the minimum ranges from 1 percent for white college

graduates to 50 percent for the two teenage groups (white non-Hispanics and

Hispanics). The next columns contain the means of 4 labor market outcomes
in 1987: average hourly earnings, the employment/population rate, the

unemployment rate, and the enrollment rate.2° Finally, the last 4 columns
give the changes in these outcomes between 1987 and 1989. For convenience,
the change in wages is expressed as a percentage of the 1987 rate.

Table 5 presents the differences in the labor market outcomes between
1987 and 1989 for each group in California relative to the corresponding

20The latter should be interpreted with some caution, since an
individual is counted as enrolled only if he or she reported his or her
main activity in the survey week as "in school". In addition, since the
sample contains all 12 months of the year, enrollment is averaged over some
months when most students are out of school.

14

differences for individuals in the comparison sauiple.21 These simple
"differences-in-differences" measure the excess changes that occurred in
California as a result of the rise in the minimum wage (or other

unspecified factors). Among the 15 groups in the table only white and
Hispanic teenagers and 20-24 year-old Hispanics show significantly

different relative wage growth. As might be expected, the two teenage
groups enjoyed substantial relative wage increases in California: the
difference-in-differences in wages is 9.6 percent for white teens (with a
standard error of 4.2 percent) and 23.1 percent for Hispanic teenagers

(with a standard error of 8.6 percent). What is more difficult to explain
are the relative increases in employment and relative decreases in

enrollment for the two teenage groups. Conventional models of minimum wage
floors predict that a rise in the minimum wage will reduce teenage

employment. In addition, it is often argued that a higher minimum will
lead to an increase in school enrollment.22 Both predictions are
contradicted by the California data.

Although the differences-in-differences in Table 5 are relatively
imprecise, one can ask whether there is any systematic relation between the

fraction of a group earning $3.35-$4.24 per hour in 1987 and the relative

changes in the labor market outcomes for that group. The answer for wages
is yes: a simple (unweighted) regression of the difference-in-differences
of wages on the fraction of workers in the group earning $3.35 to $4.24 per

21owing to the low number of Asians outside California, the sample
sizes of the "Other non-Hispanic" groups are too small for a meaningful
analysis in the comparison sample.
22See Welch (1976) and Ehrenberg and Marcus (1980) for early
discussions.

15

hour in 1987 yields a coefficient of 0.32, with a standard error of o.io.23
The magnitude of this coefficient suggests that the rise in the minimum
wage did more than simply raise the wages of those who would have earned
between $3.35 and $4.25 in the absence of the law (each of whom would
receive a 15 percent wage increase, on average, leading to a coefficient of

0.15). The pattern of wage changes in the comparison sample is for smaller
wage increases among the groups with lower wages in 1987. It is unclear
whether the sharp reversal of this pattern in California should be
attributed solely to the rise in the minimum wage.

In contrast to conventional predictions, groups with a higher fraction
of low-wage workers do not appear to have suffered any relative losses in

employment. Indeed, the correlation between the difference-in-differences
of employment rates and the fraction of workers earning $3.34-$4.25 in 1987

is 0.3. This positive correlation is mainly driven by the large increases
in relative employment registered by the two teenage groups. These
comparisons thus confirm the conclusion from the published data in Table 3:
the rise in the minimum raised the wages of low wage workers, with no
evidence of adverse employment effects.

III. Effects of the California Minimum

Given

Wage on Teenagers

the findings in Tables 3-5, this section presents a more detailed

analysis of the experiences of 16-19 year old workers in California and the

comparison states between 1987 and 1989. Figure 3 shows the hourly wage
distributions for teenage workers in California and the comparison group in

outlier is the group of 16-24 year old blacks.

the two years. The 1987 wage distributions are remarkably similar, with
modes at the Federal minimum wage and significant spikes at $3.50, $4.00

and $5.00 per hour. In 1989, however, the distributions are quite
different. Many teenagers in the comparison sample continue to earn $3.35,
$3.50, or $4.00 per hour. In contrast, much of the mass in the lower tail
of the California wage distribution has been pushed to the new $4.25
minimum.

These visual impressions are confirmed by the data in Table 6. In 1987,
52 percent of teenagers in California and 55 percent of teenagers in the

comparison sample earned between $3.35 and $4.24 per hour. The fraction of
comparison teens in the same wage interval in 1989 was 48 percent. while

the fraction of California teens dropped to 8.5 percent. The differencein-differences, in the fifth column of the table, is 36 percentage points.
This relative change in the wage distribution was associated with a 10

percent relative increase in mean wages for California teenagers. As the
data in Tables 3 and 5 indicate, however, there was no offsetting decline

in teenage employment. Hours per week of employed teenagers increased
slightly in California relative to the comparison group, while the relative

employment-population ratio rose 5.6 percent. The increase in employment
was accompanied by an increase in labor force participation and a decrease
in enrollment, with little net change in unemployment.

A broader perspective on the relative change in employment among

California teens is provided by Figure 4, which graphs 1989 teenage
employment-population rates for all 50 states against their corresponding
rates in 1987. For reference I have also plotted the 45 degree line:
points above the line represent states with higher employment rates in 1989

17

then 1987. The (unweighted) average employment-population rate increased
1.6 percent across all states, compared with an increase of 4.1 percent in

California and a decrease of 0.4 percent in the comparison states. This
broader comparison suggests that the relative increase in the teenage
employment rate in California may be slightly overstated by a comparison to

teenagers in Florida, Georgia, New Mexico, and Dallas. Whatever the
comparison group, however, there is no evidence of a decline in employment
among California teens.

The data in Table 6 make no distinction between individuals age 18 and
19, who are legally covered by the $4.25 minimum wage in California, and

individuals age 16 and 17, who are covered by a $3.60 youth subminimum. If
employers can hire 16 and 17 year olds for $3.60, and must pay $4.25 for
workers over age 18, it is conceivable that rise in the minimum generated a
shift in demand away from older teen workers and in favor of younger ones.
To check this possibility I computed the means for 16-17 year olds and 18-

19 year olds separately. Difference-in-differences of the main outcome
variables for the two subgroups are tabulated below:

If anything, the data suggest a larger increase in employment for the 18-19

year olds, although the difference is statistically insignificant. The
older group of California teenagers also experienced a slightly larger

18

relative increase in hours per week and a slightly larger relative

reduction in school enrollment. While these results rule out any
widespread substitution of younger for older teenage workers, it should be

noted that the youth subminimum is apparently only rarely used. There is
no evidence of a spike in the wage distribution of 16-17 year olds in
California at the subminimum, nor is the fraction of 16-17 year olds
earning less than $4.25 per hour in 1989 very much higher than the fraction

of 18-19 year olds (17 percent versus 10 percent). Despite the legal
provision of a youth subminimum, labor market participants seem to view the
adult minimum as the relevant one for all workers.24

IV. Effects on Retail Trade

Almost one-half of California workers whose 1987 wage rates fell between
the old Federal minimum and the new state minimum were employed in retail

trade. The experiences of the retail trade industry are especially
interesting because the regulatory Commission charged with setting the new
minimum initially established a subxninimum wage for tipped employees in the

restaurant industry. This subminimum was later overruled by the State
Supreme Court, leaving the state with a 20 percent higher-than-expected

minimum in a large sector of the retail industry. One might expect the
adverse employment effects of an unintended wage floor to be larger than
the effects of a deliberately chosen rate.

Figure 5 plots establishment-level data on overall employment in
wholesale and retail trade in California and the US from 1985 to 1989.

24Katz and Krueger (1991) present survey evidence for the fast food
industry in Texas which suggests that only 3 percent of employers use the
subminimum provision of the Federal law.

19

Data limitations preclude a separate analysis of retail trade.
Nevertheless, retail trade accounts for 80 percent of employees in the
entire trade sector, and 85 percent of those with wages in the $3.35-$4.24

range in 1987. If the California minimum generated significant employment
effects in the state's retail trade sector, they should be evident in the
overall trade figures.
Despite the high fraction of workers earning less than $4.25 in 1987,
the data in Figure 5 give no indication of an adverse effect on employment

in the California trade sector. The growth rates of trade employment in
California and the US between 1985 and 1987 were 2.65 percent per year and

2.51 percent per year, respectively. Between 1987 and 1989 these growth
rates were 2.96 percent per year and 3.61 percent per year. Comparing the
rates before and after 1987 there was actually a small relative increase
(roughly 2 percent) in trade-sector employment in California after
enactment of the new minimum.
Table 7 describes the wage and demographic characteristics of retail
trade employees in California and the comparison sample in 1987 and 1989.

There was a substantial relative reduction in the fraction of California
workers earning between $3.35 and $4.24 after the new minimum took effect.

This change was associated with a 5-7 percent relative increase in hourly

and weekly earnings among California workers. There were no corresponding
changes in weekly hours or in the age or sex composition of retail

employment. The one significant relative demographic change is an increase
in the fraction of Hispanic workers in California retailing. Contrary to
the usual predictions, none of these comparisons suggest a substitution
away from less-skilled workers.

20

I have also computed the same relative comparisons for employees of

eating and drinking establishments. These workers constitute 30 percent of
all employees in retail trade and 50 percent of those who earned between
$3.35 and $4.24 in California in 1987. The main relative comparisons are
shown below:

These data show a slightly bigger effect of the minimum wage on earnings of
restaurants workers, but again there is no evidence of skill-upgrading.

The retail trade industry, and eating and drinking establishments in
particular, are characterized by a relatively high fraction of unskilled

labor input. In light of the wage increases generated by the rise in the
minimum wage it is interesting to examine some output price data. Figure 6
presents 1987 and 1989 data for 24 major cities on the cost of food away

from home. The Eureau of Labor Statistics compiles the data for 3
California cities: Los Angeles, San Diego, and San Francisco. These are

21

highlighted in the Figure, along with a point representing the all-cities
average.

I have also graphed the fitted regression line that relates the

1989 index to the 1987 index for each city. The 1989 price indexes for Los

Angeles

and San Francisco are very close to their predicted values, given

their 1981 levels and the pattern of price changes in other cities. Prices
in San Diego, however, are some 5 percent higher than predicted.

This pattern coincides with a larger wage increase observed for San

Diego teenagers than for teenagers elsewhere in the state. Unfortunately,
the sample sizes for individual cities in the CPS are small and some city-

specific variation can be expected from the sample design of the CPS. Thus
it is very

difficult

to obtain reliable estimates of teenage wages by city.

While it may be tempting to attribute the San Diego increases to the
relatively larger wage increases there, the absence of a statewide pattern
of increases for the price of food away from home is still a puzzle.

Some further evidence on prices in the restaurant industry is presented

in Table 8. This table gives actual price data for McDonald's QuarterPound hamburgers in 7 California cities and 10 comparison cities in 1987

and 1989. The prices are collected on a quarterly basis by local
affiliates of the American Chamber of Commerce Researchers Association

(ACCRA).25 The lower panel of the Table gives the price in each city
relative to the average price for all cities in the ACCRA sample (which

changes slightly from quarter to quarter). The intercity dispersion of
prices in any quarter is fairly wide (up to 18 percent). Nevertheless,

25Affiliates are given relatively precise instructions on sampling
procedures. Each reported price is based on a sample within the city.
Affiliates are instructed to sample the price of a "quarter-pound
hamburger, McDonald's if available". I assume that affiliates in the
cities selected in Table 8 have sampled Qj]y McDonald's prices.

22

most cities tend to retain their relative price position. Among the
California cities, Riverside, Sacramento, and San Diego show systematically

higher relative prices in 1989 than 1987. The other 4 cities show little

net change. Thus, neither the LS data nor the ACCRA data give any
indication of a state-wide increase in restaurant prices.

V. Interretatton of the Findjn&s
I find no evidence for the conventional predictions that economists

make regarding the impact of minimum wages. Although the rise in the
minimum raised the earnings of low-wage workers, its effects on employment

were, if anything, positive rather than negative. Even in the low-wage
retail trade industry I can find no evidence of an adverse employment

effect. For teenagers the effects of the rise in the minimum wage are
particularly striking: wages and weekly earnings rose by 10 percent, the
employment-population rate rose by 2-6 percent, and school enrollment rates

fell by 5 percent. The observed employment changes contrast to predictions
based on the earlier literature, which imply a 3-8 percent reduction in
teenage employment following a 27 percent increase in the minimum wage.

These findings are clearly inconsistent with a conventional competitive

model of the low-wage labor market. An alternative model that is often
raised in theoretical discussions of the minimum wage is one in which
employers of low-wage workers have market power and act as monopsonistic

purchasers of labor (see for example Stigler (1946)). In this model the
imposition of a binding wage floor can lead to an increase in wages, an
increase in employment, an increase in industry output, and a reduction in

industry selling prices. In my opinion, the experiences surrounding the

23

rise in the California minimum wage suggest that this or other alternative
models deserve more careful scrutiny.
One

piece

of evidence which suggests that wages of California teenagers

were below their long-run equilibrium level prior to the rise in the
minimum is presented in Figure 7.

Here I have plotted the age profiles of

wages for young workers in California and the comparison sample in 1987 and

1989. The data in Figure 7 are simple averages of log wages for each age
group, although adjusted age profiles that control for differences in
education, enrollment status, race, sex, and hours of work show the same

pattern. Wages of the youngest group of workers in California in 1987 were
substantially out-of-line with wages for older workers, given the age

profiles observed in the comparison sample in 1987 and 1989. If the age
profiles in the comparison sample are assumed to represent a competitive
labor market, then wages for 16-17 year olds in California in 1987 were

artificially depressed by some 10-12 percent. This is about the amount
that the increase in the minimum wage raised teenage wage rates. Rather
than creating "above market" wages for young workers, however, the figure
suggests that the rise in the minimum wage simply restored relative wages
to their normal level.

Whether a monopsonistic model provides the correct interpretation of
events in the labor market for California teenagers between 1987 and 1989
is of obvious importance for economists' interpretation of labor market

behavior and policy. Economists have been reluctant to admit the
possibility of market power in the labor market, owing to the mobility of
workers and to the fact that most labor markets involve large numbers of

24
relatively small employers.26 It seems unlikely that a monopsonistic
outcome arises from the market power of an individual employer.

Nevertheless, when teenage workers are asked about the wage rate they would
require to move to a similar job in the same area, they report a

surprisingly high 26 percent premium over their current wage.27 This
suggests that some employers may enjoy a degree of monopsony power.
An alternative view is that the California labor market became
"trapped" in an equilibrium with excess demand for labor

-

- perhaps

because employers had historically viewed the Federal minimum as a binding
wage floor and failed to adjust to the decline in its real value over the

1980's. Given that wage, and a general shortage of labor, no individual
employer had an incentive to offer a (marginally) higher wage to recruit

new workers.28 However, employers continued to post vacancies and
continued trying to recruit new workers without raising the wages of their
existing workforce.

Much more research will be needed before economists embrace non-

competitive models of the labor market. In the meantime, evidence from the
study of California's experiences should temper any confident assessment of
the welfare economics of minimum wages.

260ne exception is the market for highly specialized labor in a
particular geographic location. Sullivan (1990) examines the market for
registered nurses and finds evidence of exploitable market power at the
hospital level. Ransom (1990) examines the market for academic faculty and
interprets the negative relation between wages and length of service as a
monopsony effect.
27Thjs estimate is derived from a sample of 1028 employed teenagers in
the 1982 wave of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth who report a
hypothetical hourly wage required to move to a similar job at a different
employer. The standard error on the estimated premium is 0.01.
28Technically, what is required is that the supply of new recruits to
an individual firm is less than perfectly elastic at the market wage. This
is more plausible if the market wage is below its equilibrium level.

This paper analyses extracts from the 1987 and 1989 Merged Outgoing

Rotation Group Monthly Files of the CPS. The extracts include all
individuals age 16-69 from the States of California, Florida. Georgia, and
New Mexico, as well as all those identified as living in the Dallas-Fort

Worth Texas PMSA. Individuals in the extracts who report being paid by the
hour (on their main job) are assigned their reported hourly pay as a

"wage". Individuals who report being paid by the week/month/etc. are
assigned the ratio of their reported weekly earnings to their reported

usual weekly hours as a "wage". In 1987. weekly earnings information is
provided in 2 fields: an edited field, which is censored at $999 per week,

and an unedited field, which is censored at $1923 per week. I use the
edited earnings data for individuals who are paid by the week/month/etc.
and who report edited weekly earnings less than $999.

I use the unedited

earnings data for those whose edited weekly earnings are censored.

Individuals with allocated hourly or weekly earnings are assigned a missing
wage, as are individuals whose wage (reported or constructed) is less than

$1.00 per hour. This affects only 2 observations in 1987 and 18 in 1989.
