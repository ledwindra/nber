    "abstract": "\n\nAlternative work arrangements, defined both by working conditions and by workers\u2019 relationship to their employers, are heterogeneous and common in the U.S. This article reviews the literature on workers\u2019 preferences over these arrangements, inputs to firms\u2019 decision to offer them, and the impact of regulation. It also highlights several descriptive facts. Work arrangements have been relatively stable over the past 20 years, work conditions vary substantially with education, and jobs with schedule or location flexibility are less family-friendly on average. This last fact helps explain why women are not more likely to have schedule or location flexibility and seem to largely reduce hours to get more family-friendly arrangements.\n\n",
