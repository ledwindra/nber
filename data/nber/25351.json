    "abstract": "\n\nLarge capital inflows are understandably viewed as dangerous in emerging markets living with memories of recent currency crises: in Israel foreign capital provided crucial funding for investment in the country\u2019s showcase technology sector. Israel is now solidly established as a high-tech powerhouse\u2014a place where budding venture capitalists from emerging market countries flock to learn how to develop an innovation ecosystem. However, the domestic market alone is far too small and homegrown capital formation insufficient to foster that innovation. Globalization has been essential. The paper reviews the crucial role which globalization forces played Israel\u2019s transformation from low tech to high tech economy. Special emphasis is placed on foreign direct investment as a driver for the high-tech transformation.\n\n",
