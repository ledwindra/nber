    "abstract": "\n\nSchool districts historically approached conflict-resolution from the perspective that suspending disruptive students was necessary to protect their classmates, even if this caused harm to perceived offenders. Restorative practices (RP) \u2013 focused on reparation and shared ownership of disciplinary justice \u2013 are designed to address undesirable behavior without imparting harm. We study Chicago Public Schools\u2019 adoption of RP and identify decreased suspensions and arrests, driven by effects for Black students. We find null effects on test-score value added, ruling out average declines larger than 0.025SD. We estimate a 15% decrease in out-of-school arrests, consistent with RP substantively changing student behavior.\n\n",
