Market-specific and Currency-specific Risk During the Global Financial Crisis: Evidence
from the Interbank Markets in Tokyo and London

JEL No. E44,F32,F36
ABSTRACT
This paper explores how international money markets reflected credit and liquidity risks during the
global financial crisis. After matching the currency denomination, we investigate how the Tokyo Interbank
Offered Rate (TIBOR) was synchronized with the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) denominated
in the US dollar and the Japanese yen. Regardless of the currency denomination, TIBOR was highly
synchronized with LIBOR in tranquil periods. However, the interbank rates showed substantial deviations
in turbulent periods. We find remarkable asymmetric responses in reflecting market-specific and currency-specific
risks during the crisis. The regression results suggest that counter-party credit risk increased the difference
across the markets, while liquidity risk caused the difference across the currency denominations. They
also support the view that a shortage of US dollar as liquidity distorted the international money markets
during the crisis. We find that coordinated central bank liquidity provisions were useful in reducing
liquidity risk in the US dollar transactions. But their effectiveness was asymmetric across the markets.

Introduction
In a well-integrated market, assets with the same risk characteristics would yield identical

expected returns. Controlling regulatory treatments, the yield spreads among fixed-income assets
denominated in the same currency should be equalized in normal times.

However, reflecting risk

characteristics, the spreads may show substantial differences in crisis periods.

In this paper, we

explore how the Tokyo and London money markets reflected credit and liquidity risks during the
global financial crisis in 2007-2009.

After matching the currency denomination, we investigate how

the Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate (TIBOR) was synchronized with the London Interbank Offered
Rate (LIBOR) denominated in the United States (US) dollar and the Japanese yen.
LIBOR, the world's most widely used benchmark for short-term interest rates, is calculated
for 10 currencies including the US dollar and the Japanese yen.

To the extent that the Japanese

market segment is highly integrated with the world, TIBOR would show synchronization with LIBOR.
However, as risk characteristics vary substantially, TIBOR may not be synchronized with LIBOR in
crisis periods.

In particular, it is not clear how well the synchronization with LIBOR persists when

economies are under serious financial crisis.
The following analysis investigates to what extent TIBOR was synchronized with LIBOR in
2007-2009.

To calculate the synchronization, dollar-denominated TIBOR (that is, Eurodollar

TIBOR) is matched with dollar-denominated LIBOR (that is, Eurodollar LIBOR).

Yen-denominated

TIBOR (that is, Euroyen TIBOR) is also matched with yen-denominated LIBOR (that is, Euroyen
LIBOR).

The matches allow a comparison of their returns without exchange rate risk.

The sample

period of the analysis is noteworthy because it includes the periods before and after the global
financial crisis.

Regardless of the currency denomination, the Tokyo market was highly

synchronized with the London market before the crisis broke out.

However, during the global

financial crisis, the interbank offered rates showed substantial deviations even denominated in the
same currency. More interestingly, they show remarkable asymmetric responses reflecting regional
risk premiums.
2

During the global financial crisis, the credit quality of European and US banks deteriorated
substantially, but that of Japanese banks did not.

We find that risk premiums raised LIBOR more

than TIBOR when denominated in the Japanese yen but increased TIBOR more than LIBOR in
dollar-denominated

markets.

The

asymmetric

impacts

in

the

dollar-denominated

and

yen-denominated markets had a “home bias” feature reflecting different risk premiums under the
liquidity crisis.

Our regression results show that credit risk increased the difference across the

markets, while liquidity risk caused the difference across the currency denominations.

They also

support the view that a shortage of US dollar as liquidity distorted the international money markets
during the global financial crisis.
Several studies have explored the degree of integration in world money markets in normal
times and in crisis periods.

Exploring the London and New York interbank markets, Bartolini, Prati,

and Hilton (2007) showed that the two markets were highly integrated in the period 2002--2004.
McAndews (2008), on the other hand, found that LIBOR was significantly higher than the US rates at
times of market distress beginning in August 2007.

Baba and Packer (2009a,b) investigated

dislocations in the foreign exchange swap market between the US dollar and three major European
currencies under the global financial crisis and found that deviations from covered interest parity were
negatively associated with the creditworthiness of European and US financial institutions.1

In

contrast, Michaud and Upper (2008) showed that the cross-sectional dispersion of the premiums was
largely independent of banks’ credit risk and was mainly driven by factors related to the funding
liquidity under the global crisis.

Castiglionesi, Feriozzi, and Lorenzoni (2009) proposed that

integration helps to reallocate liquidity when different countries are hit by uncorrelated shocks but
leads to larger spikes in interest rates on the interbank market when an aggregate liquidity shock hits.
As for the integration between the London and Tokyo interbank markets, numerous studies
investigated a source of upward deviations of TIBOR from LIBOR in the late 1990s (see, among

[2004], Peek and Rosengren [2001]).

Galpin, Resnick, and Shoesmith (2009) found a strong

positive relationship of risk premiums in LIBOR, SIBOR (Singapore Interbank Offered Rate) and
TIBOR, while Fukuda (2011) explored how the relationship changed over two decades for various
Asian interbank rates.

Analyzing the effects of the global financial crisis, Taylor and Williams

(2009) showed how risk premiums of US-dollar-denominated LIBOR were correlated with those of
yen-denominated TIBOR.

But there are very few studies that explored the degree of integration

between the Tokyo and London money markets during the global financial crisis.
The following analysis confirms part of the findings in previous studies.

previous studies, this analysis investigates how the global financial crisis affected risk premiums in

However, we find that the global financial crisis had asymmetric impacts on risk premiums of the

markets but also between liquidity risks denominated in different currencies.

2.

The Interbank Offered Rates
In the following analysis, we use the daily offer rates for TIBOR and LIBOR.

This section

briefly describes the data of these interbank offered rates used in the analyses.

London.

LIBOR is a daily reference rate based on the interest rates at which banks borrow

unsecured funds from other banks in the London wholesale money market (or interbank market).

As

the world's most widely used benchmark for short-term interest rates, LIBOR is the rate at which the
world's most preferred borrowers are able to borrow money.

It is also the rate upon which rates for

less preferred borrowers are based.
LIBOR is calculated by Thomson Reuters and published by the British Bankers' Association
after 11:00 a.m. each day (Greenwich mean time).

Excluding the top two and the two bottom

reference rates, it is a trimmed average of interbank deposit rates offered by designated contributor
banks, for maturities ranging from overnight to 1 year. Each currency panel comprises contributor
banks, and the reported interest is the mean of the middle values (the interquartile mean).3 The rates
are a benchmark rather than a tradable rate; the actual rate at which banks lend to one another varies
throughout the day.
LIBOR is calculated for 10 currencies: the Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, Danish krone,
euro, Japanese yen, New Zealand dollar, Pound sterling, Swedish krona, Swiss franc, and US dollar.
The following analysis uses LIBOR denominated either in the US dollar or the Japanese yen. Because

In 2009, reference banks for the US dollar were Bank of America, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd,
Barclays Bank, Citibank NA, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank AG, HSBC, JP Morgan Chase, Lloyds Banking
Group, Mizuho Corporate Bank, Norinchukin Bank, Rabobank, Royal Bank of Canada, Royal Bank of
Scotland Group, Société Générale, UBS AG, and WestLB AG. Those in the Japanese yen are almost the
same. But they include Mizuho Bank and Sumitomo Mitsui instead of Credit Suisse and Royal Bank of
Canada.

TIBOR is a daily reference rate based on the

interest rates at which banks offer to lend unsecured funds to other banks in the Japan offshore market.
The daily TIBOR data are available denominated in the Japanese yen and in the US dollar.

Although

there is a partial overlap of reference banks between LIBOR and TIBOR, the reference banks in
TIBOR are dominated by Japanese banks.
The Japanese Bankers Association (JBA) has been publishing daily TIBOR denominated in
the Japanese yen ("Japanese yen TIBOR") since November 1995 and "Euroyen TIBOR" since March
1998.

The Japanese yen TIBOR reflects prevailing rates on the unsecured call market, while the

Euroyen TIBOR reflects prevailing rates on the Japan offshore market. JBA calculates Euroyen
TIBOR as a prevailing market rate based on quotes for 13 maturities (1 week, 1-12 months) provided
by reference banks as of 11:00 a.m. each business day (Tokyo time).4

Like the LIBOR rates, the

JBA excludes the top two and the two bottom reference rates for each maturity and takes the average
of the remaining rates. These averages are published as the TIBOR rates (13 rates each for the
Japanese yen and Euroyen) through information providers that have contracts with JBA.

The JBA

does not publish a TIBOR rate denominated in the US dollar which we refer to “Eurodollar TIBOR”.
But Bloomberg and Nikkei Quick News Inc. collect the Eurodollar TIBOR data.

LIBOR and TIBOR in the 1990s and the 2000s
Before exploring risk premiums during the global financial crisis, this section investigates

the nature of the relationship between the daily offer rates for the 3-month TIBOR and the 3-month
LIBOR throughout the 1990s and the 2000s.
December 2009.

The sample period is from 28 February 1991 to 30

The period includes not only tranquil periods but also two turbulent periods, that is,

the Japanese banking crisis and the global crisis periods.

3.1.

Risk Premiums in the US Dollar
This subsection explores the nature of the relationship between the daily offer rates for the

3-month Eurodollar rates in the London and Tokyo markets: the US dollar-denominated TIBOR
(Eurodollar TIBOR) and LIBOR (Eurodollar LIBOR).

In the data set used, the different trading

times could be a source of deviation between the two series. But, to the extent that the effects of the
time difference are negligible, the arbitrage condition suggests that the two series will show similar
dynamics because both are denominated in the same currency.
Table 1 summarizes annual average and annual standard deviations of Eurodollar spreads
(that is, US-dollar-denominated TIBOR minus LIBOR) in each calendar year from 1991 to 2009.
The annual average was positive throughout the sample period, but was below 0.1 points except for a
few years and fell below 0.03 points from 2000 to 2007.

The correlation between LIBOR and

TIBOR from 2000 to 2007 exceeded 0.99, suggesting that, despite the time difference between
London and Tokyo, LIBOR and TIBOR are normally highly integrated.
However, TIBOR became significantly higher than LIBOR during the period of the Japanese
banking crisis.

The annual average spread exceeded 0.1 points from 1996 to 1999.

In particular, it

exceeded 0.44 points in 1998, when the Japanese banking crisis became critical.

The difference
7

between LIBOR and TIBOR, which is often referred to as the "Japan premium" in the literature, can
be interpreted as representing the credit risk of Japanese banks at that time.
In Table 1, the annual average spread became close to 0.09 points in 2008 and exceeded 0.1
points in 2009.

This implies that TIBOR became significantly higher than LIBOR during the global

financial crisis.

Risk premiums in the Eurodollar markets boosted both LIBOR and TIBOR during

the crisis, but the impacts were greater on TIBOR than on LIBOR.

In terms of credit risk, the

impacts are paradoxical because the credit quality of European and US banks had been downgraded
substantially while that of Japanese banks had not been downgraded under the global financial crisis.
The result suggests that liquidity risk, rather than credit risk, might have been important in US dollar
transactions under the crisis.

3.2.

Risk Premiums in the Japanese Yen
The last subsection investigated the relationship between the two daily offer rates for the

3-month Eurodollar LIBOR and TIBOR.

This subsection explores the same relationship by using

the daily offer rates for the 3-month yen-denominated rate in London (Euroyen LIBOR) and Tokyo
(Euroyen TIBOR).5

Except for the denomination currency, these rates are traded in the same manner

as those used in the last subsection. To the extent that the choice of currency denomination does not
change the risk characteristics, one can expect that the two series to show similar dynamics as those
observed in the last section.
Table 2 summarizes annual average and standard deviation of the yen-denominated spreads
(Euroyen TIBOR minus Euroyen LIBOR).

As in the Eurodollar markets, the annual average became

large during 1995--1999, especially in 1998, when the credit quality of Japanese banks deteriorated
substantially. But the deviation was smaller than that in the Eurodollar markets.

This suggests that

the credit risk during the Japanese banking crisis was reflected less in the Euroyen TIBOR than in the

Eurodollar TIBOR.

In general, Japanese banks can access various alternative sources for their

yen-denominated borrowings but may not do so for their dollar-denominated borrowings.

During

the crisis, this caused asymmetric increases in the observed risk premiums of Japanese banks in the
US dollar vis-à-vis in the Japanese yen.
The Table shows that the annual average, when positive, was very small in nonfinancial crisis
periods.

It showed modest deviation from zero during 2003–2005, when the Bank of Japan

intensified its quantitative easing policy. The unconventional monetary policy distorted
yen-denominated money markets but not dollar-denominated ones. The TIBOR–LIBOR spreads still
remained small even in yen-denominated transactions in the first half of the 2000s.
A more noteworthy result in the Table is that the annual average Euroyen TIBORLIBOR
spreads became negative in 2007 and 2008.

This implies that, unlike in the Eurodollar markets, risk

premiums raised LIBOR more than TIBOR in the Euroyen markets during the global financial crisis.
Given that the deteriorated credit quality of European and US banks during the crisis, this is a natural
consequence.

However, as shown in Figure 1, the risk premiums raised TIBOR more than LIBOR in

the Eurodollar markets at the same time. This indicates that during the global financial crisis, the
choice of the denomination currency dramatically changed how risk premiums were reflected in each
interbank market.

The result suggests the importance of distinguishing not only between credit risk

and liquidity risk in different markets but also between liquidity risks denominated in different
currencies.
Figure 1 depicts the TIBORLIBOR spreads in both the Eurodollar and the Euroyen
markets in the two crisis periods: that of the Japanese banking crisis (4 January 1995 to 30 December
1999) and that of the global financial crisis (1 January 2007 to 30 December 2009).

During the

Japanese banking crisis, the TIBORLIBOR spreads started to take positive values in the summer of
1995 in both the Eurodollar and the Euroyen markets. The spreads became temporarily small from
April 1996 to October 1997, then became very large after the collapse of major Japanese financial
institutions in November 1997.

The spreads remained large through March 1999.

A key feature in
9

this period is that the TIBORLIBOR spreads had very large positive values in both markets,
although they were larger in the Eurodollar rate than in the Euroyen rate.

There is a strong

co-movement of the spreads between the Eurodollar and Euroyen rates.
In contrast, during the global financial crisis, the TIBORLIBOR spreads started to take
opposite signs in the two markets. Before August 2007, the spreads were close to zero in both markets.
But after August 2007, the spreads started to take positive values in the Eurodollar market and
negative values in the Euroyen market.

Before the summer of 2008, the absolute values of the

deviations were slightly larger in the Euroyen than in the Eurodollar market. Then, after September
2008, they became larger in the Eurodollar than in the Euroyen market. The asymmetric impacts in
the two markets are in marked contrast with what was observed during the Japanese banking crisis.
The asymmetric deviations continue into the beginning of 2009. After January 2009, the
TIBORLIBOR spreads started to take positive values in both markets.

4.

A Model
Ever since the turmoil began under the global financial crisis, several alternative

explanations have been offered for the dramatic upward deviations of the money market rates from
the corresponding risk free rates.

The most commonly mentioned explanations might be

summarized into “counterparty credit risk” and “liquidity risk” (see, for example, Taylor and Williams
(2009)).

But since our main interest is to compare interbank rates in different money markets and in

different currency denominations, the following analysis assumes that these risks consist of both
currency-specific and market-specific factors.

We denote the interbank money market rate

denominated in currency h in market k in period t by i(h, k)t and decompose it as follows

(1)

i(h, k)t = Rf(h)t + Risk(h, k)t + Liquidity(h, k)t,

where h = US dollar or Japanese yen and k = Tokyo or London.
10

In the right hand side of (1), Rf(h)t is risk-free rate denominated in currency h in period t.
With the same terms to maturity, the risk-free rate captures the effect of expected future interest rate
changes on i(h, k)t.

Expectations of future interest rate decline due to policy easing, for example,

will cause the term interbank rate to decline through decreasing the risk-free rate with the same
term-to-maturity.

Since the risk-free rate is not market-specific, Rf(h)t is independent of any specific

factor in market k.
Risk(h, k)t is a counterparty credit risk in currency h in market k in period t.

“Counterparty

credit risk” means that banks became more reluctant to lend to other banks because of the perception
that the risk of default on the loan had increased and/or the market price of taking on such risk had
risen.

During the global financial crisis, the credit quality of European and US banks deteriorated

substantially, but that of Japanese banks did not.

This suggests that the London market carried a

larger counter-party credit risk than did the Tokyo market.

It is likely that Risk(h, k)t is sensitive to

the specific factor in market k.
Liquidity(h, k) t is a liquidity risk in currency h in market k in period t.

“Liquidity risk”

means that traders at one bank are reluctant to expose the traders’ bank’s funds during a period of time
where those funds might be needed to cover the bank’s own shortfalls.

In the financial turmoil, the

trader may not be given as much “balance sheet” to invest, which is perceived as a shortage of
liquidity to the trader.

In this situation, term loan markets come under stress, and term interest rates

may be disconnected from overnight interest rates.

Because of the role of the US dollar as the

international currency, the traders were especially sensitive to a liquidity shortage of the US dollar in
international transactions.

It is likely that Liquidity(h, k) t is more conspicuous in the international

transactions denominated in the US dollar.

5.

“Counterparty Credit Risk” and “Liquidity Risk”
To measure counterparty credit risk in Tokyo, London, and New York, the following analysis

uses the credit default swap (CDS) prices of the banks in each country.

We use the daily time series

for the United Kingdom and the United States.

The data is based on CMA Data Vision which was

positively with the CDS index for Japan and negatively with the CDS index for the UK.

In our data

set, the CDS index for Japan, which covers not only banking sector but also the other financial sector,
is more volatile than the indexes has several large upward spikes.

The following analysis thus used

its logged value for the index for Japan.
Unlike credit risk, it is difficult to measure liquidity risk directly.

But during the global

financial crisis, the central banks made several attempts to improve liquidity premiums in money
markets.

To the extent that the central bank has the ability to reduce the liquidity risk premium

effectively, measuring the effects of these attempts is a crucial first step toward understanding the
nature of the liquidity risk premium.

In the following analysis, we estimate the effects of the Federal

Reserve Bank (FRB)’s Foreign Exchange (FX) Swap Lines with the Bank of Japan (BOJ), the Bank
of England (BOE), and European Central Bank (ECB).

For the FX Swap Lines with each central

bank, we include a dummy variable which takes one on the dates for the operations and zero
otherwise.

For the FX Swap Lines with BOJ, we also include a dummy which equals to the amount

allocated on the dates for the operations and zero otherwise.

In addition, to capture the

announcement effects of the FX Swap Lines, we include a dummy variable which takes one on the
dates when FRB announced the swaps lines and zero otherwise.
To measure the effects of the other central banks’ attempts to reduce liquidity risk premium,
we include dummies for the FRB’s Term Auction Facility (TAF)6 as well as the BOJ’s “outright
purchases of CP” and “special funds-supplying operations to facilitate corporate financing”.7
6

The

Under the Term Auction Facility (TAF), the FRB auctions term funds to depository institutions in the
United States. All depository institutions that are eligible to borrow under the primary credit program is
eligible to participate in TAF auctions. All advances must be fully collateralized. Each TAF auction is
for a fixed amount, with the rate determined by the auction process (subject to a minimum bid rate).
7
“Outright purchases of CP” is funds-supplying operations to purchase CP and ABCP that are deemed

dummy variable for the BOJ’s “outright purchases of CP” which equals to the amount allocated on the
dates for the operations and zero otherwise.

Each of the other dummy variable takes one on the

dates when each operation took place and zero otherwise.

These facilities and the FX swaps could

have different effects on the LIBOR and the TIBOR.

The swaps credit of the US dollar was

available only to depositories outside the U.S. in the countries in which the central bank participated
in the swaps program, while the TAF credit of the US dollar was only directly available to depository
institutions in the U.S.

The BOJ’s “outright purchases of CP” and “special funds-supplying

operations to facilitate corporate financing” increase availability of the Japanese yen only for financial
institutions located in Japan.

Comparing the effects of these facilities, we can see the difference of

the liquidity premiums across the markets and across the currency denominations.
In addition to the above variables, we include both yen-denominated and dollar-denominated
three-month overnight index swap (OIS) rate in the New York market, deviation from the covered
interest parity (CIP) condition, and the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index (VIX) as

The VIX which was introduced by Whaley (1993) is a popular measure

of the implied volatility of S&P 500 index options.

A high value corresponds to a more volatile

market and therefore more costly options. Often referred to as the fear index, it represents one
measure of the market's expectation of volatility over the next 30 day period.

Econometric Tests
In the following sections, we endeavor to test how various factors—including the risk

measures and liquidity measures —affect the TIBORLIBOR spread.

The dependent variable in the

regression is either the three-month Eurodollar TIBORLIBOR spread or the three-month Euroyen
TIBORLIBOR spread.

For each dependent variable, we estimate the following equations:

(2)

Eurodollar spreadt = constant + hk Risk(h, k)t + hk Liquidity(h, k)t,

(3)

Euroyen spreadt = constant + hk Risk(h, k)t + hk Liquidity(h, k)t,

where h = US dollar or Japanese yen and k = Tokyo, London, Europe, or New York.

For each

equation, we also include the lagged values of the spreads, the lagged values of the first time
difference of the spreads, and the auxiliary variables as explanatory variables.
Equations (2) and (3) imply that each TIBORLIBOR spread is determined by several
counter-party credit risks and liquidity risks in the two markets.

To the extent that the effect of the

time difference is negligible, taking the difference between the interbank rates denominated in the
same currency enables us to cleanse expectations effects that are reflected in the risk-free rate Rf(h)t.
In each regression we use daily data during the sample period from January 4, 2007 through
December 30, 2009, a span of time that includes both the market turmoil period and a comparable
period of time before and after the turmoil.
For equations (2) and (3), we perform our tests with OLS regressions and two extended
GARCH models, that is, EGARCH and GJR-GARCH models.

The OLS regression is primitive in

provides a robust result that is less sensitive to a change of model specification.

However, it

In contrast, the

EGARCH (exponential general autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic) model proposed by
Nelson (1991) allows the sign and the magnitude of the variance of the error term to have separate
effects on the volatility. The GJR-GARCH model proposed by Glosten, Jagannathan and Runkle
(1993) allows threshold values of the variance of the error term.

The two GARCH models are useful

when asset pricing prices have different volatilities depending upside and downside risks or when
only large shocks attract investors' attention.
Let ut denote the error term of the estimated equation, that is, (2) or (3), and assume that ut
 z t ht where ht is the conditional variance of ut.

Then, the variance equation of EGARCH(2,2) is

represented as

(4)

ln(ht) = c + f11|zt-1| + f12|zt-2| + f21zt-1 + f22zt-2 + f31ln(ht-1) + f32ln(ht-2).

To the extent that either f11 or f12 in EGARCH is significantly different from zero, the EGARCH
model suggests that the variance equations have asymmetric dynamic process.

Similarly, the

variance equation of GJR-GARCH(2, 2) is represented as

(5)

ht = c + g11ut-12 + g12ut-22 + g21ut-12It-1 + g22ut-22It-2 + g31ht-1 + g32ht-2,

where It = 1 when ut-1 < 0 and 0 otherwise.

When either g21 or g22 in GJR-GARCH is significantly

different from zero, the GJR-GARCH model suggests that the variance equations have asymmetric
dynamic process with threshold values.

However, the estimation results of each GARCH model are

sensitive to a change of model specification.

We estimate GARCH(m, n) for 0  m 2 and 0  n 2

for each model and report the result of GARCH(m, n) that had the highest log likelihood.

Estimated Results by OLS Regressions
This section first reports the results of our tests with OLS regressions during the sample

period from January 4, 2007 through December 30, 2009.

The results are summarized in Table 3 for

the Eurodollar TIBORLIBOR spread and Table 4 for the Euroyen TIBORLIBOR spread.
the tables show the estimation results with and without the auxiliary variables.
Breusch-Godfrey Serial Correlation LM Test rejects serial correlations in the residuals.

Both of

In all cases,
Among the

estimated coefficients, some of the auxiliary variables are significant when they are included.
However, regardless of the inclusion of the auxiliary variables, the effects of credit and liquidity risks
are essentially the same.
In all cases, both the CDS index for Japan and the CDS index for the UK enter with the
correct sign and are highly significant.

Although the CDS index for the USA is insignificant, this

implies that credit risk of Japanese banks increases TIBOR and that of UK banks increases LIBOR.
Regardless of the denomination currency, the market-specific counterparty credit risks are the
important determinants of the TIBOR – LIBOR spread.

During the global financial crisis, the credit

quality of European banks declined substantially, but that of Japanese banks did not.

This suggests

that LIBOR carried a larger counter-party credit risk than did TIBOR in both yen and dollar
transactions.
In contrast, dummies of the FX Swap Lines are significant for the Eurodollar spread but not
for the Euroyen spread.

The FX swap facilities are designed to improve liquidity conditions in

global money markets by providing foreign central banks with the capacity to deliver U.S. dollar
funding to institutions in their jurisdictions.

Using funds accessed through the swaps, the BOJ

provided dollar liquidity to institutions in Japan and so did the BOE to institutions in the UK.
For the Eurodollar spread, the dummy for the BOJ’s swap line is significantly negative
especially when the amount allocated is used, while the dummy for the BOE’s swap line is
significantly positive.

The opposite signs between these FX swap facilities indicate that the BOJ’s
16

swap line was more effective in reducing US dollar liquidity risk in the Tokyo market and so was the
BOE’s in the London market.

The significantly positive sign of the dummy for the FRB’s FX swap

announcements, on the other hand, suggests that the FX swap facilities, on average, might have been
more successful in reducing liquidity risk in London than in Tokyo.

With the auxiliary variables, the

ECB’s swap line and the TAF credit have the same sign as the BOE’s but are statistically insignificant.
For the Euroyen spread, the BOJ’s swap line is significantly negative when the amount
allocated is used for the dummy.

The BOJ’s swap line might have been effective in reducing yen

liquidity risk in the Tokyo market.

But the other dummy variables to measure liquidity risk are not

significant for the Euroyen spread.

This is not only true for dummies of the FX Swap Lines and the

TAF which provide dollar liquidity but also for dummies of BOJ’s “outright purchases of CP” and
“special funds-supplying operations to facilitate corporate financing” which provide yen liquidity.
Regardless of the market location, yen-specific liquidity risk might not have been the important
determinants of the TIBOR – LIBOR spreads during the global financial crisis.
Because of the role of the US dollar as the international currency, the traders are especially
sensitive to a liquidity shortage of the US dollar under the critical environments.

The shortage might

have been more serious in Tokyo market than in London market because the latter is thicker than the
former in terms of trading volume of the US dollar.

This may explain why TIBOR was higher than

LIBOR denominated in the US dollar during the global financial crisis.

Estimated Results by EGARCH, and GJR-GARCH
In this section, we estimate EGARCH and GJR-GARCH models from January 4, 2007

through December 30, 2009 and examine how various factors affect the TIBORLIBOR spread.
The results with the auxiliary variables are summarized in Table 5 for the Eurodollar TIBORLIBOR
spread and Table 6 for the Euroyen TIBORLIBOR spread.
when we include all of the explanatory variables.

The GARCH models did not converge

We thus report the results excluding both Japanese

bank’s stock excess returns and the ECB’s swap line dummy and including only one of the two BOJ’s
17

swap line dummies, that is, the dummy for which the amount allocated is used.

GJR-GARCH(1,0) had the highest log likelihood for the Eurodollar spread and so did EGARCH(1,2)
and GJR-GARCH(1,2) for the Euroyen spread.
asymmetry in EGARCH.

The Eurodollar TIBORLIBOR spread showed no

However, in the other cases, the selected models suggest that the GARCH

processes have not only significant persistence but also significant asymmetry.
In the GARCH models, several auxiliary variables show less robust signs and significance
levels.

For example, in Table 5, deviation from the CIP conditions, which was significantly positive

in OLS, is still positive in GJR-GARCH but becomes significantly negative in EGARCH.
Dollar-denominated three-month OIS rate and VIX, both of which were not significant in the OLS
regressions, become significantly positive in EGARCH and significantly negative in GJR-GARCH.
However, in the GARCH models, the effects of credit risk on the TIBORLIBOR spread are
essentially the same as what we observed in the OLS regressions.

In particular, the CDS index for

Japan is significantly positive and the CDS index for the UK is significantly negative in all cases.
Regardless of the denomination currency, credit risk of Japanese banks increases TIBOR and that of
UK banks increases LIBOR.

Unlike in the OLS regressions, the CDS index for the USA becomes

significant for the Eurodollar spread.

But its sign differs between EGARCH and GJR-GARCH,

suggesting that its effects are not robust for the model specification.
In the GARCH models, the effects of liquidity risk on the TIBORLIBOR spreads are also
very similar to what we observed in the OLS regressions.

For the Eurodollar spread, the BOJ’s swap

line is significantly negative and the BOE’s swap line is significantly positive in both EGARCH and
GJR-GARCH.

This indicates that in reducing dollar liquidity risk, the BOJ’s swap line was effective

in the Tokyo market and so was the BOE’s in the London market.

For the Eurodollar spread, both

and GJR-GARCH.
significant.

The latter is in contrast with our OLS regressions where the FRB’s TAF was not

The GRACH models suggest that not only the FRB’s FX swap facilities but also the

FRB’s TAF might have be more successful in reducing US dollar liquidity risk in London than in
18

Tokyo.
For the Euroyen spread, the FRB’s FX swap announcement is significantly positive in both
EGARCH and GJR-GARCH.

This is in contrast with what we observed in the OLS regressions.

However, the other dummy variables to measure liquidity risk are not significant except in almost all
cases.

Even the BOJ’s swap line, which was significantly negative in our OLS regressions, is no

longer significant in the GARCH models.

This implies that the effect of BOJ’s swap lines in the

OLS regressions is not robust for the Euroyen spread.

Our GARCH models more strongly support

the view that yen-specific liquidity risk might not have been the important determinants of the
Euroyen TIBOR – LIBOR spread during the global financial crisis.

Results under Shorter or Longer Terms to Maturity
Until the last section, we have investigated the degree of synchronization between TIBOR

and LIBOR by using the three-month interbank rates.

The use of the three-month rates is desirable

in that three-month is most widely transacted term to maturity in the money markets.

However, the

terms-to-maturity transacted in the international interbank markets vary from 1 week to 12 months.
It thus deserves to see to what extent our main results hold when we use the rates that have shorter or
longer terms to maturity.

This section explores this by using the one-month and the twelve-month

interbank offered rates.
For the one-month and the twelve-month rates, Figures 2 depicts the TIBORLIBOR
spreads in the Eurodollar and the Euroyen markets from 1 January 2007 to 30 December 2009.

As

we found for the three-month interbank rates, the TIBORLIBOR spreads in the two markets show
opposite signs during the global financial crisis.

Regardless of the term to maturity, the spreads took

positive values in the Eurodollar market and negative values in the Euroyen market after the crisis
broke out.
However, the amplitude of the spreads is very different depending on how long the term to
maturity is. The absolute values of the Eurodollar TIBORLIBOR spreads became larger as the
19

term-to-maturity is shorter.

The spreads frequently became greater than 0.2 points and sometimes

exceeded 0.4 for the one-month rate, while they rarely exceeded 0.1 points for the twelve-month rate.
In contrast, the absolute values of Euroyen TIBORLIBOR spreads became larger as the
term-to-maturity is longer.

The spreads fell below -0.1 points after August in 2007 and became

lower than -0.3 points in October 2008 for the twelve-month rate, while they usually lied between 0
and -0.1 points and rarely fell below -0.2 for the one-month rate.

In addition, the spreads remained

negative even in 2009 for the twelve-month rate, while they turned to be positive in 2009.

The

difference probably reflects the facts that US dollar liquidity risk is higher in shorter time horizon and
that credit risk is larger in longer time horizon.
Using these spreads as dependent variables, we estimate our basic equations (2) and (3) by
OLS regressions.

The results are summarized in Table 7 for the Eurodollar TIBORLIBOR spreads

and Table 8 for the Euroyen TIBORLIBOR spreads.

They are the results excluding Japanese

bank’s stock excess returns and including only one of the two BOJ’s swap line dummies, that is, the
dummy for which the amount allocated is used.

Compared with the results in section 7, some of

them are slightly sensitive to the model specification.

This may happen because transactions of

one-month and twelve-month rates are not as thick as those of three-month rates.
the estimation results without most of the auxiliary variables.

The tables report

But we include an auxiliary variable

when the estimated coefficients are unstable for a small change of specification or when we cannot
reject serial correlations.9
In both tables, the effects of credit risk on the TIBORLIBOR spreads are essentially the
same as what we observed for the three-month rates.

In particular, the CDS index for Japan is

positive and the CDS index for the UK is negative in all cases, although the UK CDS index was
insignificant for the twelve-month Eurodollar spreads.

For example, since one-month Eurodollar spread had an upward spike on September 19,

2008, we include a dummy for it to remove the effect of the outlier.

In both tables, the effects of liquidity risk on the spreads are also similar to what we
observed for the three-month rates.

For the Eurodollar spreads, the BOJ’s swap line is significantly

negative and the BOE’s swap line is significantly positive for both the one-month and the
twelve-month rates.

This indicates that in reducing US dollar liquidity risk, the BOJ’s swap line was

effective in the Tokyo market and so was the BOE’s in the London market.

It also suggests that not

only the FRB’s FX swap facilities but also the ECB’s swap line might have be more successful in
reducing US dollar liquidity risk in London than in Tokyo.

For the Euroyen spreads, the results are

the same as what we obtained by OLS regressions for the three-month rates.

The BOJ’s swap line is

But the other dummy variables to measure liquidity risk are not significant

for the Euroyen spreads.

Regardless of the market location, yen-specific liquidity risk might not

have been the important determinants of the TIBOR – LIBOR spreads during the global financial
crisis.

Concluding Remarks
Financial crisis increases risk premiums in national and regional financial markets. This paper

explored how international money markets reflected such risk premiums during the global financial
crisis. Unlike medium- or long-term financial markets such as bond markets and stock markets,
money markets play an important role in providing liquidity. Therefore, not only credit risk but also
liquidity risk are important in the money markets during financial crisis.
After matching the currency denomination, how TIBOR has been synchronized with LIBOR
was investigated.

Our noteworthy finding is the remarkably asymmetric responses in how the Tokyo

market reflected both credit and liquidity risk premiums during the global financial crisis.

We find

that the asymmetric impacts in the dollar-denominated and yen-denominated markets had a “home
bias,” reflecting different liquidity premiums during the financial crisis.
The regression results suggest that credit risk explains the difference across the markets,

while liquidity risk explains the difference across the currency denominations.

still dominant vehicle currency in international transactions.

They also indicate
The US dollar is

As a result, during financial crisis, risk

premiums in the US dollar transactions were driven not only by counter-party risk but also by factors
related to funding liquidity.

In particular, pressure in the interbank market made it critical for

non-US banks to retain access to other sources of dollar funding.

This suggests that distinguishing

between liquidity risks denominated in different currencies is important and that coordinated central
bank liquidity provisions are useful in reducing liquidity risk in the US dollar transactions.
