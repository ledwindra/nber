    "abstract": "\n\nOver the last several decades, numerous medical studies have compared the effectiveness of two common procedures for Coronary Artery Disease: Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) and Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG).  Most evidence indicates that CABG - the more invasive procedure - leads to superior long term outcomes for otherwise similar patients, though there is little consensus as to why.  In this article, we propose a novel explanation: patient offsetting behavior.  We hypothesize that patients who undergo the more invasive procedure, CABG, are more likely to improve their behavior - eating, exercise, smoking, and drinking - in a way that increases longevity.  To test our hypothesis, we use Medicare records linked to the National Health Interview Survey to study one such behavior: smoking.  We find that CABG patients are 12 percentage points more likely to quit smoking in the one-year period immediately surrounding their procedure than PCI patients, a result that is robust to numerous alternative specifications.\n\n",
