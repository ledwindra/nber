Are Franchises Bad Employers?
Peter Cappelli and Monika Hamori
NBER Working Paper No. 13327

JEL No. J31,L22
ABSTRACT
Franchise jobs are often described as representing the epitome of the "low road" approach to managing
employees: high turnover, little training, deskilled jobs, and little employee involvement, practices
often seen as unsophisticated. Research on franchise operations suggests, however, that the basic operating
principles and practices of franchises tend to be more sophisticated than those of equivalent independent
operators. We might therefore expect their employee management practices to be more advanced
as well, challenging the stereotype of franchise jobs. We use data from a national probability sample
of establishments to examine the relationship between franchise status and employment practices.
While descriptive statistics suggest that franchise operations use low road practices, once industry,
size, and other control variables are included in the analysis, franchise operations appear on important
dimensions to offer better jobs with more sophisticated systems of employee management than similar
non-franchise operations.

Introduction
Franchises are an important part of the U.S. economy. There are an estimated 1,500
franchise companies operating in the U.S. doing business through 320,000 retail units (see
International Franchise Association estimates). Our data, described in more detail below,
suggests that they represent about five percent of all establishments in the U.S. Franchises
represent an alternative to traditional forms of business operations. They signify a legal
agreement where the independent franchisee sells a product or service using the brand name
and/or operating system of the franchisor, typically in return for a lump sum payment and annual
royalty fee (Shane, 1996, Shane & Foo, 2001).
Franchises have a market-like aspect due to the exchange of capital and products between
the franchisor and the franchisee; they also have a hierarchical aspect due to the uniform
operating procedures set by the franchisor (Norton, 1988). Franchises also represent a hybrid
between the attributes of small and large-scale operations in that they function with some
autonomy as independent establishments but are also part of a much larger franchise
organization. The product or service’s image, marketing, and basic operating practices are
produced most efficiently in large scale by the parent (Rubin, 1978), while the actual production
of the goods and services is most efficient when it is decentralized to the place of consumption
(Caves and Murphy, 1976).
The management of employees and work organization issues is central to most franchise
operating procedures, in part because franchises are especially common in services where labor
content is the crucial component. And the popular image of franchises is that they provide lowquality jobs. We consider the conceptual arguments behind that position and then examine it
empirically in the analyses below.

3

Franchises and Employment Practices:
The descriptive literature on franchises reinforces the idea that franchises provide lowquality jobs (e.g. Zuber, 1997; Matusky, 1998; Schaaf, 1994; Feuer, 1988), although most of that
work is anecdotal. Franchise outlets appear to make extensive use of part-time and temporary
employees (Leidner, 1993) and do not invest much in recruiting because they do not expect
employees to be with the organization for a very long time (Royle, 1998). They also appear to
pay low wages. Royle (1998), for example, emphasizes the huge disparity between the US
average wage and the starting wage at McDonald’s. Benefits like health insurance and sick days
are entirely absent at some franchise operations (Leidner, 1993). Franchise operations are
marked by a very high rate of turnover that can reach 300 per cent per year (Krueger, 1991).
While the practitioner-oriented literature hails the effectiveness and superiority of
training practices of franchises (e.g. Zuber, 1997; Matusky, 1998; Schaaf, 1994; Feuer, 1988),
Litz and Stewart (2000) survey 307 hardware stores in a trade name franchise chain and question
whether franchises train more than independent stores. Whether workers actually learn much
from franchise training is another open question. Wildavsky (1999) asserts that fast food
franchise workers learn both job-related skills, such as how to operate a cash register or train
others, and general, transferable skills such as teamwork, customer service or getting along with
coworkers; Leidner (1993), on the other hand, points out that the training for making French
fries, for example, consisted of simply watching a short videotape, and the most skilled job,
window work, demanded only three to four hours of total training time (Leidner, 1993).
Among the larger and more sophisticated franchises, such as McDonald’s, there is at least
a priori evidence suggesting that the basic approach to management – generating standardized
“best practices” and transferring them across organizations - bears a great deal of similarity to

4

that of scientific management. Frederick Taylor’s model for organizing production work began
by systematically gathering up the tacit knowledge of production held by skilled workers and
organizing it into precise, formalized rules that defined the performance of each specific task
performed by every individual worker (see Taylor, 1947 for a discussion).

The effect of

scientific management approaches on worker-level outcomes, particularly skill requirements, is
extremely well documented: Because knowledge is built into rules, procedures, and systems,
individual workers no longer need to have that knowledge, and job requirements fall. (See
Braverman, 1974 for the seminal work and Attewell, 1987 for a review.) Less-skilled workers,
who are cheaper, can be hired into these de-skilled jobs and then trained to follow the
standardized approaches. Leidner’s (1993) ethnography of franchise operations argues that their
routinization of work practices leads to tight managerial control, detailed job descriptions, and
plenty of specifications and regulations, very much like scientific management.
Hierarchical and bureaucratic forms of supervision and control have an independent
effect on limiting the autonomy of employees by transferring decision making up the hierarchy
(e.g., Perrow 1972; Edwards 1978). The franchise model, where the design and control over
operating procedures lies at the franchisor headquarters, very much resembles a bureaucratic
control system. Bureaucratic systems of control through hierarchy are also part of the scientific
management approach, as the design and control of jobs is separated from the execution of work
and transferred to layers of industrial engineers and supervisors. In the case of highly specialized
jobs, for example, it is difficult for workers to coordinate their work with others on their own
because they often lack the knowledge and the links to do that. Further, highly specialized work
is less intrinsically motivating, which again increases the need for hierarchical supervision

5

(Lawler, 1988). The practices of scientific management and the practice of hierarchical control
systems both limit the autonomy and control of employees.
Scientific management implies different outcomes for franchise management jobs,
however, as managers may need greater skill to execute the operating practices. Parcel and
Sickmeier (1988) highlight how McDonald’s simultaneously uses a secondary labor market for
front-line workers with low entry criteria, low wages, low degree of autonomy and little
employment stability, and an upper-tier labor market with high wages and benefits and clear
lines of promotion to attract managers with the knowledge, skills, and abilities to develop and
maintain these routines.
One argument reconciling why franchises could have more sophisticated management
practices in general and apparently unsophisticated low road employment practices would be that
they rely on these scientific management principles. The poor employment outcomes for frontline workers could be part of an intentional strategy. A great deal of contemporary research in
human resources and industrial relations, however, has emphasized the considerable advantages
for employers of “high commitment” or “high performance” work systems associated with
greater worker involvement and participatory decision processes (e.g. Berg, 1999; Berg,
Kalleberg and Appelbaum, 2003). High performance work practices, which focus on employee
involvement and team work arrangements, also tend to be accompanied by supporting programs
such as worker training (Osterman 1994). Wages for workers employed in high commitment
systems are higher than those employed by traditional organizations, especially for managers,
supervisors, and technical workers in unionized establishments (Black, Lynch and Krivelyova,
2004). While the early studies on high commitment work systems showed benefits associated
with individual performance, the more recent studies demonstrate effects associated with firm-

6

level outcomes in services as well as the more typical manufacturing settings (e.g., Combs, Liu,
Hall and Ketchen, 2006; Preuss 2003).
If the essence of franchise management is to identify effective management practices,
standardize and distribute them across franchise outlets, then it is not obvious why franchise
operations would not also include high performance work practices in their portfolio. Further, it
is not obvious that the descriptive literature on franchise jobs is definitive. Most of the studies
that point out the poor quality of employment practices at franchises focuses on fast food outlets,
especially McDonald’s (e.g. Love, 1985; Parcel and Sickmeier, 1988; Leidner, 1993; Royle,
1998 and 2000). Many of the characteristics of jobs at those franchises appear to be common to
all fast food jobs. The franchises that were examined in these studies also tend to be relatively
small operations, and small firms often lack the resources to develop human resource practices
like training (Kalleberg et al, 1996; Litz and Stewart, 2000). Vickerstaff (1992) found, for
example, that smaller firms lacked both the training infrastructure (training specialists and
budgets) and the training capacity (employees’ time and training skills) to implement training
programs.

To truly understand the workplace practices that characterize franchises, it is

necessary to control for these other attributes that are associated with typical franchise operations
as they may well confound any association between job quality and franchise status.
The few studies that control for these factors carefully are those that compare franchiseeowned establishments to company-owned establishments, often in the same chain, e.g., a
franchisee-owned Burger King store compared to a company-owned Burger King (e.g., Krueger,
1991 and Bradach, 1998). This approach is very helpful for examining the effects of ownership
structure per se, but it cannot examine the effect of franchise operating practices because the
basic operating models are the same in company-owned and franchisee-owned operations within

7

the same chain. The nature of the relationship between franchise operations and employment
practices therefore demands further examination, which we turn to below.

Hypotheses
Our central question, based on the conflicting implications of the literature cited above, is
whether franchises offer lower quality jobs than do non-franchise operations. The perception
that they do is widespread, but whether that apparent association is due to confounding factors is
an important empirical question. Research suggests that franchises in general are more
sophisticated in their management practices than equivalent non-franchise operations, which
might lead one to hypothesize that their workplace practices would also be more sophisticated
and not necessarily the “low road” approach with which they are associated.
Asking this question requires first establishing criteria for deciding the quality of jobs:
What constitutes a good job? One approach, for example, might be to compare the perceptions
of workers themselves in franchise and non-franchise operations: Which ones are more satisfied
with their jobs? The difficulty with this approach is that interpreting differences in attitudes
across jobs is very complicated because satisfaction levels are in part influenced by expectations,
and representative attitudinal data across operations is extraordinarily difficult to obtain. A more
straightforward approach is to examine the attributes of jobs directly. Kalleberg, Reskin and
Hudson, 2000 focus on three factors to measure job quality: wage level, pension benefits and
health insurance. Other aspects of jobs no doubt are important as well, such as promotion
prospects, the specific aspects of individual tasks as they relate to principles of job design,

8

relationships with superiors and other aspects of interpersonal dynamics, etc.2 Many of these are
complicated to measure (or even to define) and, unfortunately, are beyond the scope of the data
that we know to exist. We believe most observers would agree that important measures of job
quality include aspects of the rewards from work (pay and benefits), employer investments in
employees (training programs), and, especially in the context of franchises, work organization
practices that affect employee involvement along the lines of high performance systems.
An important caveat to the notion of assessing job quality is that the distinction between
good jobs and bad jobs is somewhat arbitrary. In fact, job quality is likely to represent a
continuum that depends on which attributes of jobs are being examined. And the fact that
workers may have different preferences with respect to these attributes (e.g., some prefer parttime work) makes even a continuum complicated to construct.
Methods and Data
To address the questions above, we need data that can compare the employment practices
of franchises to equivalent non-franchises in order to control for possible confounding
relationships. To do so, we turn to the National Employer Surveys (see Cappelli 2001 for a
description). Conducted by the U.S. Bureau of the Census, the National Employer Surveys are
representative surveys of all private sector, for-profit U.S. establishments with more than 20
employees (excluding corporate headquarters). The 1994 National Employer Survey sampled
over 4000 of these establishments. The survey was administered via Computer Assisted
Telephone Interviewing to a target respondent of the plant manager in manufacturing
establishments and the local business site manager in service establishments. The survey also
obtained information from multiple respondents where the target respondent thought those
2

One could imagine controlling for the attributes of individuals holding those jobs as well in order to determine
whether jobs are better than one would expect given the quality of the workers. This approach answers a slightly

9

responses would be more accurate. It asked about establishment characteristics, work
organization practices, and human resource practices. The overall response rate was 72% with
no apparent differences between respondents and non-respondents on dimensions such as
industry type or size. The 1994 public use data file that resulted contains data on 3173
establishments.
The 1996 National Employer Survey interviewed a sub-sample of the establishments
from the 1994 survey and also asked whether the establishment was a member of a franchise
organization. The response rate for the 1996 survey was 75%. By matching the data from the
1994 survey to the franchise question from 1996, we have a data set with 2136 observations that
identifies organizational and work practices for a national sample of franchises and nonfranchised establishments.3
Cross-sectional data of this kind creates obvious difficulty in establishing causal
relationships. That concern is mitigated in this context, however, because the direction of
causation seems clear on logical grounds. It is straightforward to see how the decision to
become a franchise drives work practices because the use of specific operating procedures is
typically required by the franchise agreement. These, in turn, either define the employment
practices or drive employment outcomes. It is much more difficult to imagine the reverse case,
where employment outcomes exogenously cause an establishment to become a franchise or a

different question, though, whether jobs offer a market premium as opposed to whether they are good per se.
3
Establishments do switch status from franchise to non-franchise and visa versa, although such changes are rare –
Peterson and Dant (1990) found that the number of franchisees that have ever been an independent operator, e.g.,
was only 6.7 percent. The rate of change over a short period like 1994 to 1996 is likely to be insignificant for the
purposes of empirical analyses. We know so little about what causes franchise status to change in either direction
that it is difficult even to speculate as to possible relationships with the other variables. Not all franchise agreements
are the same. The important distinction is between “trade name” franchises, where the franchisee acquires the right
to sell a particular product and manage its operation with considerable autonomy (e.g., a gas station’s relationship
with an oil company) versus “business unit” franchises, where the operations are highly structured according to prior
agreements (e.g., most fast-food chains). While we might expect relationships with work practices to be stronger for
business unit franchises, we cannot distinguish the two in our data.

10

franchise to switch to a different ownership form. Further, the type of work practices and
outcomes we are considering are in no way unique to franchise status, so there is no reason to
believe that having these practices would require that a firm take the franchise form.
A different concern with respect to estimation is whether franchise status and work
practices are determined simultaneously. Simultaneous observations could bias OLS estimators
asymptotically, although OLS estimation may still be preferred over other forms (e.g., by being
more robust). Again, the process through which franchise operations take place suggests that
franchise status occurs first and then work practices follow. While they may appear to be
simultaneous in the sense that most franchise firms begin operations with their work practices in
place, the actual process is invariably that operators decide to become a franchise and then roll
out the operating procedures, which include work practices.

Variables and Analyses
The arguments above at least satisfy the requirement of Granger Causation and suggest
that simple regression models are sufficient to establish the estimates of the relationship between
franchise status and work practices and associated outcomes. Among the primary variables to
consider in deciding whether franchises offer good jobs are wages, which we measure separately
for managerial and non-managerial (typically front-line) workers.4 This measure is for full-time
workers. It would be useful to have similar data for part-time workers as well but such data is
unavailable. We also include a count of how many among 10 important benefits the
establishment offers its employees. All of these benefits add fixed costs to employment and are
typically seen as practices that help create attachment between firms and employees. Not all

11

benefits are equal in terms of value or cost, of course, and there is a wide range of possible
analyses one could conduct to examine relationships with benefits. This approach at least has the
benefit of parsimony.5
Another important variable is the extent of training offered to employees, which we
measure with three variables: First, whether the establishment has a written training program or
policy in place, second, the percentage of employees who receive formal training each year, and
third, the number of hours of formal training employees receive each year. The last two
variables are measured separately for managerial and non-managerial employees.
One way to capture the extent of pay, benefits, training, and other expenditures on
employees is with a single measure of total labor costs. This variable comes from the 1997
National Employer Survey, which asks about expenditures for 1996, the year for which the
franchise question is collected. 6 We also include other measures of job quality – the percentage
of workers who have part-time status, the average education level of the workforce (measured
separately for management and non-management employees), and a proxy for turnover and
tenure. Actual turnover measures are not available, only the percentage of the workforce with
less than one year of tenure. This measure is important in its own right as an indication of the
extent of new hires in the workplace. It should vary directly with turnover, but it, like all
measures of tenure, can be confounded by employment growth: Growing companies, other

4

The original question in the survey asked for average hourly pay, but because not all establishments had
compensation data in that format, they were allowed to report it as weekly, monthly, or hourly pay. The reports
were therefore converted to a standard metric of annual salaries based on 40 hour workweeks and 52 week years.
5
The benefits are: pension, severance pay, health insurance, dental insurance, life insurance, sick pay, paid
vacations/holidays, family leave (this was before the Family and Medical Leave Act), grievance/complaint
procedures, and stock options.
6
The size control variable helps to adjust for difference in labor costs based simply on having more employees. Per
employee measures have important caveats, though, in that establishments may differ in their use of part-time labor
and overtime hours. If franchises make greater use of part-time workers, e.g., then their labor cost per employee
measure should be understated compared to the true expenditure per unit of labor.

12

things equal, have lower tenure independent of turnover rates. Because employment growth
rates are not available, it is important to recognize that this measure is an imperfect proxy for
turnover.
We also have two measures for high performance work systems that have been used in
previous studies. The first is the percentage of the workforce involved in regularly scheduled
meetings to discuss workplace problems. This measure captures something about the extent of
employee participation in the workplace, but it is also fair to say that it is an imperfect measure
as we do not know how much involvement employees truly have in these discussions. The
second measure is whether the establishment has a total quality management program. Hackman
and Wageman’s (1995) study of TQM practices found that problem-solving teams, a central
aspect of high performance systems, was the most common attribute of TQM programs.
In addition, we control for establishment size (measured as the logarithm of the number
of employees working at the establishment in 1996) and the industry that the establishment
operates in (measured by ten binary variables, the omitted category is “Other manufacturing”).
Table 1 presents a description of the ten industries.
We do not have detailed measures of the human capital and demographics of the
employees in these establishments other than their average education level. The focus here is on
the jobs per se, but attributes of the employees would allow us to answer other questions as well,
such as whether franchises disproportionately employ younger workers or whether they pay a
premium for equivalent workers as compared to non-franchises.
The analyses below begin with difference-of-means tests for franchise and non-franchise
establishments followed by regression models that control for the most important characteristics
of establishments that may be spuriously associated with the franchise form. Because the

13

analyses are examining the possible effect of the franchise form on various practices and aspects
of employment, each such aspect in measured by a different dependent variable and is therefore
essentially a separate model. Whether each equation should have a unique model specification
based on its own theoretical underpinnings is an important question. Without an established
literature to define what such models should look like in each case, however, it is not obvious
what characteristics or management practices other than industry, size, and establishment age are
truly exogenous to franchise status and therefore should be controlled for in the equation. There
are also advantages of consistency in using the same model across equations.
In addition to direct effects, franchise status may also have indirect effects on the
dependent variables considered here through relationships with other variables. For example,
greater use of part-time jobs may reduce average education levels. If the goal is to see what the
net effect of franchise operations is, then it is sufficient to examine the reduced form of what are
no doubt more complicated relationships: By leaving out possible control variables that could be
endogenous to franchise status, all of the possible indirect effects appear together in the franchise
coefficient.

This approach is sufficient to address the question as to whether franchises are

associated with good jobs. The caveat is that it does not answer the more complicated question
concerning why franchise jobs might be better or worse.
Results
Table 1 provides descriptive detail on some of the characteristics of franchises in the U.S.
by size and industry classification. Smaller establishments (with less than 100 employees)
contain a slightly greater proportion of franchises than in the overall population (8 versus 5.4
percent). Mid-size establishments (between 101 and 435 employees) have about the same
proportion of franchises as in the economy as a whole, while larger establishments

14

(establishments with more than 435 employees) have about half as many franchise organizations
as in the overall economy (3 versus 5.4 percent). Franchises are quite rare in manufacturing.
They represent 2.2 percent of organizations in the manufacturing sector versus 5.4 percent in the
whole economy. The distribution of franchise organizations in the service sector is twice as great
as in the economy as a whole (10.9 vs. 5.4 percent), and franchises are disproportionately
concentrated in retail (31.1 percent), in hotels and restaurants (29.7 percent) and in business
services (11.8 percent). They are roughly in proportion to the economy as a whole in most of the
other service industries. As one would expect, franchise status appears to be related strongly to
other important attributes of employers.

-- Insert Table 1 about here –

The difference-of-means tests in Table 2 show that in terms of human capital, franchises
pay lower wages and salaries both to their non-managerial workers (20.5 vs. 24.7 thousand USD,
p<.001) and to their managerial employees (40.6 vs. 49.1 thousand USD, p<.01). They employ
three times as many part-time workers (6 vs. 18%, p<.001) and twice as many employees who
have less than one year of tenure with the organization (27 vs. 14%, p<.001). The results seem
consistent with the stereotype of “bad” jobs, although franchises are significantly more likely to
have a formal training policy (72 vs. 58%, p<.01) and, on balance, they may provide more
training both in terms of the percentage of employees trained and total training hours. What we
cannot know from these results is the extent to which the differences in Table 2 are driven by
franchise status per se or other attributes that are associated with franchises.

15

The regressions presented in Table 3 control for industry and the size and age of the
organization. The results are strikingly different from those in the difference in means tests.
There are no significant differences with respect to pay or benefits for franchises; the signs of the
variables actually point toward higher pay and benefits for franchises. The results for training
are consistent with the idea that franchises provide more extensive and intensive formal training
to their employees than do non-franchise operations. Franchise operations are more likely to
have a formal training policy (ß=.45, p<.1), they train a significantly higher percentage of their
non-managerial workforce (ß=9.34, p<.05) and they provide more training hours per employee
(ß=.4, p<.05). And overall, labor costs per employee are higher in franchise operations. There is
no support for the idea that franchises pursue a strategy of lower expenditures on employees.
Franchises also appear to make greater use of work organization practices associated with
employee involvement, such as work-related meetings (ß=2.26, p<.1) and TQM practices (ß=.56,
p<.01).
On the other hand, franchises do employ non-managerial employees with fewer years of
education (ß=-.19, p<.1), they have a higher percentage of part-time workers (ß=.03, p<.05), and
have a higher percentage of employees with less than one year of tenure on the job (ß=4.43,
p<.01) than do non-franchise operations.
The size of the coefficients on the control variables remind us just how important basic
factors like industry and establishment size are in determining employment outcomes.
Consistent with the argument that larger employers provide better working conditions (Brown,
Hamilton and Medoff, 1990), large-sized establishments in this sample are also significantly
more likely to have higher labor costs, provide higher pay for their managers and for their nonmanagerial staff, make more investment into the training of their employees, and hire employees

16

of higher human capital.

But the effects associated with franchise status are also sizeable:

Controlling for industry and employment levels, for example, franchises spend $170,000 more
per year on employees than do non-franchises.
From among the industry controls, the comparison of the “Franchise” variable with the
“Hotels and restaurants industry” and “Retail” controls provides useful insights, given that most
of the franchises examined in the extant literature operate in these two industry classifications
(e.g. Bradach, 1998; Leidner, 1993; Royle, 2000). The predictor “Franchise” often has the
opposite coefficient than the predictors “Hotels and restaurants” and “Retail”, showing that
franchises do take a different approach to managing their employees than establishments in the
hotels and restaurants and retail industries per se. In separate analyses, available on request, we
examine the interaction between the hotel/restaurant industry variable and franchise status. The
coefficient of the interaction variable across the models in Table 3 generally suggests that
franchises in that industry provide better employment outcomes, although the results are
significant in only about one-third of the cases, possibly because the number of observations in
that industry (101) is relatively small.
Finally, the control variable that measures the establishment’s turnover rate is significant
in all but three of the equations where it is included. Establishments with a higher turnover rate
provide lower pay and fewer benefits both to their managerial and non-managerial employees.
Their managers and non-managerial employees have lower education levels, and fewer of them
are involved in work-related meetings. Such establishments are also less likely to have TQM
practices.

17

Discussion and Conclusions
This study is the first to use nationally representative data to examine franchise
operations and their work practices in detail. The basic question we investigate is whether
franchise forms of operation are associated with lower quality jobs. The results above suggest
that this bad jobs stereotype in franchises may have been based on confounding attributes
associated with franchises rather than franchise status per se. Franchises are concentrated in
smaller establishments, which have fewer resources, and in industries like hotels and restaurants,
which have lower-quality jobs. But within those sectors, franchise operations appear to offer
more sophisticated management practices and to make greater investments in their employees.
Once we control for size and industry, we find little evidence that jobs are worse in franchises
and considerable evidence that they are better than in equivalent, non-franchise operations.
While there is some evidence that franchises may hire less qualified workers (in terms of
education) and use more part-time roles, they spend more on these workers, offer them more
training, and are more likely to engage them in employee involvement-related work systems than
do non-franchise establishments. A fair assessment might be that franchise jobs offer more to
lower-quality workers.
A related question is whether franchise operations appear to be closer to the scientific
management model or the high commitment model for managing employees. The bad jobs
argument, especially directed at fast food companies like McDonald’s, emphasizes deskilled jobs
based on approaches that look much like scientific management. On the other hand, the fact that
franchises are generally seen as more advanced in their management practices than equivalent
non-franchise operations suggests that they would be more likely to use high performance work
practices than non-franchise operations. Franchises do hire less educated front-line employees,

18

as one would expect from scientific management, but the fact that they spend more money on
their employees is certainly inconsistent with the goal of scientific management, which is to
lower employee costs by deskilling jobs. We also find no evidence that franchises use better paid
and educated managers, as scientific management implies.7 But the most compelling evidence
that franchises are closer to the high performance model is that they make greater use of systems
associated with employee involvement and teamwork. Data that could measure more precisely
the tasks individual workers perform and the aspects of their job design would be helpful in
establishing more clearly the extent to which franchises make use of scientific management as an
organizing principle. Additional data on the attributes of the employees might also make it
possible to tell whether franchisees treat equivalent workers better and whether, for example,
they offer efficiency wage levels of compensation.
One conclusion to be drawn from the results above is that jobs cannot necessarily be
classified easily into categories of good and bad. The particular choice of attributes and the mix
of outcomes across them suggest that we might need a much more sophisticated system of
classifying to reveal how they stack up for workers.
Several important puzzles remain about franchises and work practices, though.

An

obvious question is why franchises invest more in training but also appear to have higher
turnover at least as measured by more low-tenure workers because training investments are lost
when workers leave. Franchise training and other arrangements could be structured to earn a
return in a shorter time period; it is also possible that turnover at franchises is actually lower than
one would expect given the characteristics of the workers they hire (e.g., less educated). But this

An alternative that we cannot examine is that franchises concentrate management skill requirements at
headquarters where the operating systems are designed, allowing them to use lower quality, lower paid managers in
the establishments.

explanation leads to the more general question that has yet to be answered clearly: What is the
comparative advantage of franchises? Spending more per employee than non-franchise
operations would appear to put franchises at a considerable cost disadvantage that somehow has
to be offset – possibly through superior productivity or some other method of adding value. It is
clear, though, that the competitive advantage of franchises is not based on a model of spending
less on its employees. The fact that they continue to exist and at least in many areas thrive
against non-franchise forms suggests that they must be able to offset the labor cost disadvantage
in other ways.
A logical explanation for the above would be that franchises have productivity
advantages over non-franchise forms. Unfortunately there is little research on this issue, due to
the difficulty of accessing data on franchise financial performance in part because most franchise
chains are privately owned (Combs, Michael and Castrogiovanni, 2004). The papers that do look
at financial performance compare the performance of the various franchisee-owned outlets
(Combs, Ketchen and Hoover, 2004; Darr, Argote and Epple, 1995; Hennessy, 2003), or the
franchisee- and company-owned units of the same chain (Sorenson and Sørensen, 2001; Thomas,
O’Hara and Musgrave, 1990). The financial performance of franchises vs. non-franchise forms
remains for future research to examine. The place to begin would be with the hypothesis that the
greater use of practices such as TQM and training in franchises drives higher performance and
offsets the labor cost difference.
