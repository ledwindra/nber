JEL No. H55,I12
ABSTRACT
Prior literature has documented a positive association between income and cognitive function at older
ages, however, the extent to which this association represents causal effects is unknown. In this study,
we use an exogenous change in Social Security income due to amendments to the Social Security Act
in the 1970s to identify the causal impact of Social Security income on cognitive function of elderly
individuals. We find that higher benefits led to significant improvements in cognitive function and
that these improvements in cognition were clinically meaningful. Our results suggest that interventions
even at advanced ages can slow the rate of decline in cognitive function.

I. INTRODUCTION
Given population aging, there is considerable interest in understanding the determinants
of cognitive function at older ages and in identifying policies that could potentially prevent or
delay cognitive impairment. While some cognitive decline is normal with aging, more severe
declines often lead to the onset of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) or dementia. Alzheimer’s disease
(AD) is a progressive brain condition that affects memory, language and reasoning, and can
seriously impair an individual’s ability to carry out daily activities. In addition, AD and related
dementias (ADRD) impose a significant financial burden on patients, caregivers and public
programs such as Medicare and Medicaid (Ayyagari, Salm, and Sloan 2007; Langa et al. 2001;
Taylor et al. 2001; Hurd et al. 2013). Aggregate health care payments for persons with AD,
estimated to be $226 billion in 2015, are expected to grow over the next few years due to the
aging of the baby boom generation (Alzheimer's Association Report 2015).
Although the causes of ADRD are not well understood, there is growing evidence that
modifiable factors, such as education (Maurer 2010; Banks and Mazzonna 2012), retirement age
(Rohwedder and Willis 2010; Bonsang, Adam, and Perelman 2012) and childhood environment
(Case and Paxson 2009), influence the risk of cognitive impairment and ADRD. Building upon
this literature, in this study, we evaluate the impact of income on cognitive function at older
ages. In particular, we focus on Social Security income, which can be modified by amendments
to the Social Security Act. Indeed, given concerns about the financial sustainability of the Social
Security program, several changes are being considered by policymakers, including increasing
minimum benefits for low-wage workers and using the chained CPI to index benefits, which
would lower annual increases for recipients. Furthermore, the focus on Social Security income

3

provides important information on the extent to which interventions at advanced ages can
prevent cognitive impairment.
Although a large literature has evaluated the impact of income on a wide range of health
outcomes (Lindahl 2005; Frijters, Haisken-DeNew, and Shields 2005; Evans and Moore 2011),
in general there is not a consensus on the causal impact of income on health (Smith 1999).
Further, to the best of our knowledge, no prior study has evaluated the causal impact of income
on cognition at older ages in the U.S. The only evidence on causal effects comes from a study
based in Mexico that showed that an income supplement program targeted towards the poor
elderly led to improvements in measures of episodic memory (Aguila et al., 2015). However,
given the considerable differences between the two countries, it is not clear that these effects
would generalize to the U.S. Income may affect cognition via several pathways, including lower
financial strain or better access to health care, which have been shown to be positively related to
cognition. Higher income reduces financial strain, resulting in lower stress and fewer depressive
symptoms (e.g. Mendes de Leon, Rapp, and Kasl (1994)). Several studies have documented the
detrimental effects of stress on cognitive functioning at older ages (Andel et al. 2012; Johansson
et al. 2010) and depressive symptoms are strongly correlated with cognitive decline (van den
Kommer et al. 2013). Both chronic stress and depression are associated with elevated levels of
corticosteroids, which may lead to hippocampal changes that affect memory and
neurodegenerative processes (Korczyn and Halperin 2009).
Individuals with greater income typically have more access to health care. Even among
Medicare beneficiaries, income is correlated with more coverage through the purchase of
supplemental Medigap coverage (Ettner 1997; Fang, Keane, and Silverman 2008). Greater
access to health care services can affect neurocognitive health directly by resulting in earlier

4

detection of mild cognitive impairment (Valcour et al. 2000), thereby enabling treatment that
may delay progression to AD (Petersen et al. 2005). Greater access may also affect cognition
indirectly via better management of cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure and diabetes,
which are associated with an increased risk of cognitive decline (Daviglus et al. 2010).
On the other hand, higher income may lead to earlier retirement, which is negatively
related to cognition. French (2005) and van der Klaauw and Wolpin (2008) find that higher
Social Security income reduces labor supply and leads to early retirement. Snyder and Evans
(2006) document that reductions in Social Security benefit levels led to increases in labor force
participation for persons older than 65 years. There is strong evidence that being engaged in
work is protective of cognitive impairment and that early retirement leads to faster declines in
cognition (Rohwedder and Willis 2010; Bonsang, Adam, and Perelman 2012; Mazzonna and
Peracchi 2012). Therefore, early retirement or reduced work may offset the other beneficial
pathways through which higher income affects cognition. Thus, the net effect of income on
cognition is theoretically ambiguous.
Prior research on the relationship between income and cognitive function finds that
higher income is associated with better cognitive function (Cagney and Lauderdale 2002; Lee et
al. 2010; Lee et al. 2006); however, any observed association may represent spurious correlation
due to unmeasured confounders that are correlated with both income and cognition. For example,
persons employed in complex jobs typically earn higher wages and at the same time job
complexity is associated with better cognition (Finkel et al. 2009). In addition, childhood
environment has been shown to impact both labor market earnings (Almond and Currie 2011)
and old-age cognition (Case and Paxson 2009).

5

This project examines the relationship between income and cognition by determining
whether changes in income causally impact cognitive functioning and by uncovering any
heterogeneity in this relationship. Specifically, we assess the impact of exogenous changes to
Social Security income due to amendments to the Social Security Act in 1972 and 1977,
commonly referred to as the “Social Security Notch”. Prior to 1972, Social Security payments
were not indexed for inflation and instead benefits had been periodically increased by Congress.
In 1972, the Social Security Act was amended to provide an annual automatic cost-of-living
adjustment for benefits. However, the formula used to index benefits was flawed leading to a
faster increase in benefits relative to inflation (referred to as “double indexation”), so that
workers born after 1910 received an unintended windfall gain. This error was corrected by
Congress in 1977 leading to a reduction in benefits for those born in 1917 or later. To avoid
abrupt changes for those close to retirement, a five-year transition period was implemented
during which benefits were gradually reduced based on a special transition formula. For persons
born in 1922 or later, benefits are calculated using the new formula implemented in 1977. These
changes resulted in different cohorts receiving different benefits for the same work history.
Moreover, due to grandfathering provisions, these policy changes resulted in permanent changes
in the Social Security benefits received by these cohorts.3 Previous research has examined the
benefits notch to determine the impact of Social Security income on prescription drug use
(Moran and Simon 2006), weight (Cawley, Moran, and Simon 2010), mental health (Golberstein
2015), mortality (Snyder and Evans 2006), labor supply (Krueger and Pischke 1992), living
arrangements (Engelhardt, Gruber, and Perry 2005) and utilization of long term care services
(Goda, Golberstein, and Grabowski 2011).

Using data from the Study of Assets and Health Dynamics among the Oldest Old
(AHEAD), we compare the cognitive outcomes of persons in nearby cohorts with differing
Social Security income due to the 1977 amendments. Our estimates suggest that increases in
income affect multiple dimensions of cognition. Specifically, a thousand dollar permanent
increase in annual Social Security income leads to a 2.2% improvement in working memory,
measured by the serial 7 score, and a 1.1% improvement in knowledge, language and orientation,
measured by the mental status score. There is also a 1.4% improvement in overall cognition,
measured by the total cognition score; however this estimate is only significant at the 10% level.
Overall, this paper provides the first evidence from the U.S. on the causal impact of income,
particularly Social Security income, on cognition among the elderly.

II. METHODS
We first estimate the association between Social Security income and cognition using
ordinary least squares (OLS):

(Equation 1)

where

represents a measure of cognition, as described below, for individual in

household . The key explanatory variable in equation (1) is Social Security income at the
household level (‘

’). X represents a vector of individual and household

characteristics,  is a stochastic error term, and  represents the parameters to be estimated.
As mentioned above, a key concern with evaluating the relationship between income and
cognition is that unobserved factors may be correlated with both Social Security income and
7

cognitive function leading to a spurious correlation between the two variables. Further, causality
may run in the reverse direction with health influencing income, although this is less likely in the
case of Social Security income. Thus, the estimate

from equation (1) may not identify the

causal impact of Social Security income. To address the endogeneity of income, we estimate an
instrumental variable (IV) model using the following specification:

(Equation 2)
(Equation 3)

The instrumental variable (

is a binary indicator that takes the value one for households

whose primary beneficiary was born during 1915-1917 and zero for households whose primary
beneficiary was born in any other year between 1901 and 1930.

represents predicted

Social Security income obtained from the first stage (equation 2).
The IV model represented by equations (2) and (3) identifies the causal impact of Social
Security income on health under two key assumptions. The first assumption is that the
instrument is a strong predictor of Social Security income. Prior studies have documented that
the birth years 1915-17 represent the peak of the benefits notch and the largest deviation of
Social Security income from the trend throughout the period between 1901 and 1930. Therefore,
a binary variable defining the 1915-17 cohorts provides the strongest instrument and enables the
interpretation of the impact of an increase in Social Security income (Goda, Golberstein, and
Grabowski 2011; Cawley, Moran, and Simon 2010; Moran and Simon 2006). We also assess the
strength of the instrument in our sample based on the first stage Kleibergen-Paap rk Wald Fstatistic (Staiger and Stock 1997; Stock and Yogo 2005).
8

The second key assumption is that the instrument should not be correlated with cognitive
health except via its effect on income (exclusion restriction). In the case of our application, it is
plausible that, conditional on age, being born during 1915 to 1917 should not be correlated with
cognition relative to other adjacent cohorts except due to the notch related differences in Social
Security benefits. Although this assumption is not testable, we provide evidence consistent with
this assumption by showing that Social Security income, as affected by being born during 1915
to 1917, is conditionally uncorrelated with other individual characteristics that are associated
with income but determined prior to the receipt of Social Security payments, specifically, height
and education. All regressions cluster the standard errors at the year of birth level to account for
correlations within birth cohorts.
The IV model described above identifies the impact of the Social Security income at the
conditional mean. However, it is plausible that income has heterogeneous effects at different
parts of the distribution of cognition. For example, the largest impact of additional Social
Security income may accrue to individuals in the upper tail of the conditional distribution of
cognition since these individuals are more efficiently able to translate additional resources into
improvements in health. Alternatively, the largest impact of additional Social Security income
may accrue to individuals in the lower tail of the conditional distribution of cognition. Therefore,
to examine the heterogeneity of the impact of Social Security income, we estimate instrumental
variable quantile regression (IVQR) (Chernozhukov and Hansen 2006, Kwak 2010). We
estimate this regression for a continuous measure of cognition, specifically, the total cognition
score described below. To examine heterogeneity throughout the conditional distribution, we
focus on the 0.10, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 0.90 quantiles.

III. DATA
To determine the influence of Social Security income on cognition using the estimation
strategy described above, it is necessary to combine measures of cognition with Social Security
income for the cohorts of individuals affected by the Social Security benefits notch and of
surrounding cohorts. Thus, we use data from the Study of Assets and Health Dynamics among
the Oldest Old (AHEAD), which is a longitudinal survey of persons born before 1924 and their
spouses, regardless of age. Respondents were first interviewed in 1993 and then re-interviewed
in 1995. Initially conducted as a separate study, the AHEAD was merged with the Health and
Retirement Study (HRS) in 1998.
The AHEAD includes detailed measures that are designed to capture various dimensions
of cognition: knowledge, reasoning, orientation, calculation, and language. Specifically, the
measures that we use are (1) serial 7, (2) word recall, (3) mental status, and (4) total cognition
score. The AHEAD measures were derived from well-validated scales such as the Mini-Mental
State Examination and the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status and were adapted so that
they could be administered in a large population study (Herzog and Wallace 1997). They have
been shown to have satisfactory psychometric properties and construct validity (Herzog and
Wallace 1997).
Serial 7 measures working memory and is based on a task in which respondents are asked
to subtract 7 from 100 and to continue subtracting 7 from each subsequent number for a total of
five times. The score, ranging from 0 to 5, is the count of correct subtractions across the five
trials, with each subtraction being assessed independently.
Word recall, a measure of episodic memory, is based on a list of 10 nouns read to the
respondent who is then asked to recall as many words as possible in any order (immediate word

10

recall). After approximately 5 minutes, during which time respondents are asked other survey
questions, they are asked to repeat the task (delayed word recall). The score is the count of the
number of words that were correctly recalled from both times and ranges from 0 to 20.
Mental status is based on various tests designed to measure knowledge, language and
orientation, and sums the scores for serial 7, backwards counting from 20, object naming, date
naming and president/vice-president naming. Respondents are asked to count backwards as
quickly as possible beginning with the number 20. Answers are coded 0 for incorrect, 1 for
correct on the second try and 2 for correct on the first try. In addition, respondents are asked to
report the month, day, year and day of the week during their interview, and to name the object
they would “usually use to cut paper” and “the kind of prickly plant that grows in the desert”.
Each answer is coded 1 for a correct response and 0 for an incorrect one. New-interviewees and
re-interviewees aged 65 years or older are also asked to name the current President and Vice
President of the United States. Answers are coded 1 for getting each last name right and 0
otherwise. The mental status score ranges from 0 to 15, with a higher value representing better
cognition.
Total Cognition Score, an overall measure of cognition, sums the mental status and word
recall scores, and imputes values for missing observations (Fisher et al. 2012; Ofstedal, Fisher,
and Herzog 2005). This measure ranges from 0 to 35, with a higher value representing better
cognition.
While the continuous measures of cognition are informative, changes in the rate of
dementia and related clinical outcomes are of particular interest. Therefore, we follow Crimmins
et al. (2011) and Hsu and Willis (2013) in classifying individuals as normal, cognitively impaired
but not demented (CIND), or demented. This classification is based on a 27 point score

11

composed of the word recall, serial 7, and backwards counting tests. The 27-point score was
developed by Langa, Kabeto, and Weir (2010) to identify dementia and CIND using data from
the Health and Retirement Study (HRS).4 Scores between 12 and 27 are classified as normal,
between 7 and 11 as CIND, and between 0 and 6 as demented. In addition, we follow Herzog
and Wallace (1997) in classifying individuals as cognitively impaired if they score 8 or less on
the total cognition score.
An advantage of using the Herzog-Wallace classification is that it allows us to account
for proxy respondents. The cognitive tests in the AHEAD are only administered to selfrespondents. Proxy respondents are interviewed when the primary respondent is not available for
any reason. Poor health, in particular poor cognitive health, may be a reason for the
unavailability of the main respondent. This implies that persons with severe cognitive
impairment will likely be underrepresented in our sample, potentially leading to biased estimates
if we exclude proxies. However, proxies report on seven symptoms of the main respondent that
can be used to assess cognitive impairment (Jorm 1994; Jorm, Scott, and Jacomb 1989). These
seven symptoms, referred to as the Jorm scale, include ratings (excellent to poor) of the sample
person’s memory, judgment, and organization ability, and reports of whether the sample person
gets lost in familiar environments, wanders off and does not return, can be left alone for an hour
or so, or hallucinates. A rating of poor memory, judgment or organization is categorized as a
Jorm symptom as is an indication that the respondent gets lost, wanders off, hallucinates or
cannot be left alone. Persons with two or more Jorm symptoms are classified as cognitively
4

HRS, the sister survey of the AHEAD, began in 1992 and was merged with the AHEAD in 1998. The HRS
contains similar measures of cognitive function as the ones we use in this study. Crimmins et al. (2011) compare the
normal, CIND, and demented classifications in the HRS data to diagnostic information from the Aging,
Demographics and Memory Study (ADAMS). ADAMS surveyed a random subsample of the HRS sample and
performed detailed neuropsychological and clinical assessment of cognitive function. The authors find that this
measure correctly predicts 74% of the diagnoses from the ADAMS exams. About 52.18% of persons classified as
demented in ADAMS are correctly classified as demented in HRS. However, 12.81% of CIND in ADAMS are
classified as demented in HRS and 1.44% of Normal are classified as demented in HRS.

12

impaired.5 We use a binary indicator for cognitive impairment that is one if a person scores less
than or equal to 8 on the total cognition score or if a proxy reports two or more Jorm symptoms
for that person. The indicator is zero if the individual scores more than 8 on the total cognition
score or if the proxy reports fewer than 2 symptoms.
The key explanatory variable is self-reported household income from Social Security
retirement, spouse or widow benefits. This variable is measured in 1993 dollars. In addition, all
regressions include a basic set of covariates – own age and gender, the primary beneficiary’s age,
race and ethnicity, census region of residence, a binary indicator for residing in an MSA and
indicators for the type of household – male head- married or male head – single (female head –
never married forms the reference category).
The instrument is a binary variable indicating whether an individual received greater
Social Security benefits due to the 1972 and 1977 amendments to the Social Security Act. As
described above, this variable is defined as one for households whose primary beneficiary was
born during 1915-1917 and zero for households whose primary beneficiary was born in any other
year. To construct this instrument, we first determine the primary Social Security beneficiary for
each household, following the methodology used by prior studies on the Social Security notch
(Goda, Golberstein, and Grabowski 2011; Moran and Simon 2006; Cawley, Moran, and Simon
2010). The instrumental variable is then created based on the primary beneficiary’s year of birth.
Since the majority of married women in this population were affected by the 1977 amendments
via their husband’s earnings (Snyder and Evans 2006), the year of birth of the male member is
used to create the instrument in the case of two member households. For households with no
male members in which the respondent is a never-married female, we use her year of birth.
5

A similar approach has also been used for the classification developed by Langa, Kabeto and Weir (2010).
However, that approach is based on interviewer assessment of cognitive limitations, which is not available in the
AHEAD survey.

13

Prior research using the Social Security notch assumes that the former or deceased spouse
is the primary Social Security beneficiary in households with no male members in which the
female respondent is widowed or divorced and imputes the female member’s year of birth.
Engelhardt, Gruber, and Perry (2005) estimate that the median difference in spousal ages for this
population is three years. Thus, the primary beneficiary’s birth year for widowed or divorced
females is commonly calculated by subtracting three years from the female member’s year of
birth (e.g., Moran and Simon 2006). However, recent work by Stephens and Unayama (2015)
shows that IV estimates of the impact of Social Security income using the notch are biased
upwards by 20 to 30 percent using Current Population Survey data because age is imputed. As a
result, in contrast to the previous literature, we exclude widowed and divorced females from our
main analysis sample to minimize bias from imputed data.6
Following previous studies on the Social Security benefits notch (Krueger and Pischke
1992; Moran and Simon 2006; Cawley, Moran, and Simon 2010; Goda, Golberstein, and
Grabowski 2011), we restrict our analysis to households whose primary Social Security
beneficiary was born between 1901 and 1930. In addition to the birth year restrictions and the
exclusion of widowed and divorced females, we exclude households that report a Social Security
income of less than $100 per month and observations with missing or incomplete data on any
analysis variable. Using the 1993 wave, these restrictions yield an analysis sample of 4139

6

Consistent with the conclusions of Stephens and Unayama (2015), we find that the IV estimates are larger when
we include widowed and divorced females and impute the primary beneficiary’s birth year. For example, the IV
estimate for total cognition score is 0.783 with a standard error of 0.232 and a sample size of 6099 when we
construct the instrument for widowed and divorced females as her year of birth minus three. Alternatively, we
predict the age difference of spouses based on birth year, race/ethnicity, education, and nationality for this sample as
1.27 years. When we construct the instrument for widowed and divorced females as her year of birth minus 1.27,
the IV estimate for total cognition score is 0.739 with a standard error of 0.391 and a sample size of 6099. Overall,
we conclude that excluding widowed and divorced females with imputed values of the primary beneficiary’s birth
year minimizes bias in the IV estimates.

individuals including 673 individuals in households where the primary beneficiary was born
between 1915 and 1917.
Figure 1 presents the histograms for each outcome variable. There is considerable
variation in each measure of cognition. In the case of serial 7, about 38% of the sample obtains a
perfect score while about 7% gets every answer wrong. On the word recall test, the majority of
individuals (75%) get at least 50% of the answers wrong. About 26% of the sample obtains a
perfect score on the mental status measure. The distribution of the total cognition score is slightly
left skewed, with about 27% of the sample obtaining a score of 17 or lower. Figure 2 presents the
histogram for the 27-point score used to classify individuals as normal, CIND or demented. The
majority (66%) of the sample are in the normal range of cognitive function. About 25% are
cognitively impaired but not demented and about 9% are demented.
Table 1 presents summary statistics for the analysis sample of the cognition measures,
Social Security income, and covariates that are used in the methodology described above. The
average annual Social Security income for the sample is over $12 thousand, which is about 42%
of total household income, and the average age of respondents is 75 years old. Table 1 also
presents summary statistics separately for households whose primary Social Security beneficiary
was born during 1915-1917 and the other comparison cohorts. Social Security income is, on
average, about $1,200 higher in 1993 dollars for the 1915-1917 cohort compared to the other
birth cohorts. Additionally, individuals affected by the Social Security notch have better
cognitive function across all measures, even though these respondents are older.

IV. RESULTS

15

Table 2 displays the estimates of the correlation between Social Security income and
cognitive function using OLS models. Across all four measures of cognition there is a strong
positive relationship between income and cognition. A $1000 increase in annual income is
associated with a 0.04 higher serial 7 score (a 1.04% increase relative to the sample mean), 0.06
higher word recall (0.8%), a 0.07 higher mental status score (0.5%), and a 0.13 higher total
cognition score (0.6%). As discussed above, these estimates do not represent causal effects due
to unobserved factors and reverse causality.
In Table 3, we present results from the IV models that account for the endogeneity of
Social Security income. Column (1) presents the first stage equation results, while columns (2)
through (5) present the second stage results for each of the cognition measures. The first stage
results show that the IV is strongly correlated with Social Security income and the first stage Fstatistic is 16.19. Annual Social Security income (in 1993 dollars) is $1,160 higher for
individuals born between 1915 and 1917 compared to other cohorts, which is similar to the
unconditional difference in mean values for these groups of cohorts shown in Table 1. After
accounting for the endogeneity of income, we find a statistically significant, positive impact on
the serial 7 and mental status measures. Relative to the sample mean, there is a 2.2% increase in
the serial 7 score, and 1.1% increase in the mental status score. We also find a 2% increase in the
word recall score and a 1.4% increase in the total cognition score. The estimate for the total
cognition score is statistically significant at the 10% level and the coefficient for the word recall
score is imprecisely estimated. The IV models identify a larger effect than the OLS models,
which may be due to attrition bias in the OLS estimates from measurement error in self-reported
Social Security income. It is also plausible that unobserved factors are correlated with Social
Security income and cognition in ways that bias OLS estimates downwards. For example, prior

16

studies have shown that Social Security benefits crowd out private savings (Feldstein 1974;
Feldstein and Pellechio 1979; Attanasio and Brugiavini 2003), leading to a negative correlation
between Social Security income and wealth, which is omitted from the OLS model. To the extent
that wealth is positively correlated with cognition this would lead to a downward bias of the OLS
estimates.
Next, we assess the extent to which the identified improvements in cognitive function
represent clinically meaningful changes. In Table 4, we present results from IV models using
normal, CIND and demented cognitive function as the dependent variables. We find a 1.4
percentage point increase in the proportion of individuals exhibiting normal cognitive function
and a 0.5 percentage point increase in the proportion of individuals classified as CIND, however,
these estimates are not statistically significant. We also find a statistically significant decline in
the rates of demented individuals by 1.9 percentage points. Relative to the sample mean, this
represents a 21% drop in the rates of demented individuals. In Table 5, we present results from
the IV models using the Herzog-Wallace indicator for cognitive impairment as the dependent
variable. The first two columns present results for the main sample excluding proxy respondents.
The analysis presented in the last two columns includes 202 proxy respondents. In both samples,
we find a significant decrease in the number of individuals that are cognitively impaired of
approximately 1 percentage point. Thus, higher Social Security benefits due to the notch changes
resulted in clinically relevant improvements in cognitive function.
In Table 6, we explore heterogeneous effects by educational attainment. Specifically, we
estimate separate regressions for households whose primary beneficiary has less than a high
school education and for households whose primary beneficiary has a high school degree or
higher education. Heterogeneity by education is important for two reasons. First, the 1977

17

amendments also increased the covered earnings maximum used to calculate the “average
indexed monthly earnings” (AIME) which summarizes up to 35 years of a worker’s indexed
earnings and is used to determine benefits. As a result of this change, the notch had a larger
effect on persons with less than a high school education (Goda, Golberstein, and Grabowski
2011). As shown in Table 6, consistent with prior literature, we find that the instrument is
stronger for low education households. Among individuals with less than a high school degree,
individuals born between 1915 and 1917 received $1,734 more in Social Security income
annually (in 1993 dollars) than individuals born in other cohorts. For individuals with a high
school degree and more education, the instrument is less predictive of Social Security income.
Secondly, education has been shown to improve cognitive function (Banks and Mazzonna 2012)
and it is plausible that Social Security benefits differentially affect low versus high education
households. Although the estimates are imprecise when we stratify the sample by education, for
individuals with less than a high school degree, except for word recall, the results presented in
Table 6 consistently show that Social Security income improves cognition. A $1000 increase in
Social Security income increases mental status by 0.16 points and this estimate is statistically
significant at the 10% level. Further, although imprecise, the results suggest that the impact of
income on cognition does vary by education. For serial 7 and mental status, we find a larger
impact of Social Security income for households whose primary beneficiary has less than a high
school degree. We also find a larger decline in the rate of demented and the rate of cognitive
impairment for low education households. For households whose primary beneficiary is a high
school graduate, the effect of Social Security income is larger than the effect for low education
households in the case of word recall and total cognition.

18

Table 7 presents results from the IVQR models for the total cognition score. The point
estimate is constant for the bottom half of the conditional cognition distribution, but increases at
higher quantiles, which suggests that relative differences in cognition increase sharply with
income. At the 10th quantile, a $1000 increase in Social Security income leads to a 0.2 unit
increase in the total cognition score, while at the 90th quantile a similar amount of income results
in a 1.3 increase in the total cognition score. Only the estimate at the 90th quantile is statistically
significant at the 5% level. These results suggest that individuals with better cognition benefit
more from increases in Social Security income.
One concern with our identification strategy is that it relies on cohort differences in
income and there may be other unobserved factors that correlate with the notch changes and
cognition. To assess the potential for such biases in our estimates, we perform several robustness
checks (Table 8). First, we estimate the IV models excluding individuals who were born in 1918
or 1919 (Column 1). These individuals were exposed to the 1918 influenza pandemic, which has
been shown to affect long-term outcomes for these cohorts (Almond 2006). By excluding these
cohorts, we are able to assess the extent to which the better cognitive function of the 1915-1917
cohorts is driven by the changes due to the notch and not due to adverse consequences of the
influenza pandemic. Overall, our results are robust to excluding the 1918 and 1919 cohorts and,
in fact, are more precisely estimated, which supports our inference that the main results in Table
3 can be attributed to income changes due to the Social Security notch. We further assess the
sensitivity of our results to cohort differences by restricting the sample to a progressively smaller
range of birth years. Column 2 restricts the sample to households whose primary beneficiary was

19

born between 1902 and 1928, column 3 to households born between 1903 and 1927 and so on.7
Overall, the results are robust to smaller ranges of birth years.
Finally, we assess the impact of the notch related changes on height and educational
attainment (Table 9). These regressions serve as placebo or falsification tests and allow us to
evaluate whether the IV estimates could be attributable to unobserved cohort differences that are
correlated with the notch changes. Both height and education are well known to differ by cohort
and they are also strongly correlated with income and cognition (Case and Paxson 2008; Banks
and Mazzonna 2012). However, they should not be affected by the 1977 amendments since those
changes only impacted retirement income. Consistent with this notion, we do not find any
significant effect of the Social Security notch on height or education. Overall, these results
suggest that the identified impact of income on cognition cannot be attributed to cohort
differences.

V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we examine the relationship between income and cognition. We focus on
Social Security income, which is an important source of income for the elderly and is modifiable
through public policy. Our study contributes to the literature by providing the first evidence on
the causal impact of Social Security income in the U.S. on cognition using exogenous variation
in Social Security benefits due to the Social Security notch. We find robust evidence that higher
Social Security income improves multiple dimensions of cognitive function among the elderly.
Specifically, a thousand dollar permanent increase in annual Social Security income leads to a
2.2% improvement in working memory, a 1.1% improvement in knowledge, language and
orientation, and a 1.4% improvement in overall cognition. Further, these changes represent
7

Using a narrower range of birth years than 1905-1925 resulted in a singular X matrix.

20

clinically meaningful improvements in cognitive function. A thousand dollar permanent increase
in annual Social Security leads to a 1.9 percentage point reduction in the likelihood of being
classified as demented and a 1 percentage point decline in the likelihood of being classified as
cognitively impaired.
Our findings have important implications for aging populations. Much of the evidence on
the determinants of cognitive function has focused on factors that cannot be easily modified (e.g.
genes) or on early life interventions (e.g. education). In contrast, our focus on Social Security
income suggests that interventions even late in life can significantly improve cognition. An
important piece of evidence in support of late-life interventions comes from the literature on the
link between retirement and cognition. Studies by Rohwedder and Willis (2010) and Bonsang,
Adam and Perelman (2012) have shown that retirement leads to declines in cognitive function.
Thus, our results suggest that permanent increases in income during retirement can partially
offset the decline in cognition due to retirement.
The findings of our study also have important implications for public policy. As
discussed above, several proposals aiming to improve the financial sustainability of the Social
Security program are under consideration by U.S. policymakers. These proposals range from
reducing benefits to future recipients (e.g. using the chained CPI to index benefits) to increasing
benefits for certain targeted groups (e.g. raising minimum Social Security benefits). Our findings
suggest that increases in benefits could lead to significant improvements in neurocognitive
health. In addition to the direct impact on population health, increases in Social Security benefits
could potentially be offset by reduced health care expenditures by the Medicaid or Medicare
program, since cognitive impairments are often associated with significant health care spending.
During a period of renewed policy discussion around changes to entitlement programs for the

21

elderly, it is important to understand whether changes to Social Security might influence the
health and well-being of the elderly.

Annual Social Security income is measured in 1000s in 1993 dollars. Mean cognition represents
the means for observations between 0 and the 10th percentile, above the 10th and up to the 25th
percentile, above the 25th and up to the 50th percentile, above the 50th and up to the 75th
percentile, and above the 75th and up to the 90th percentile. Since the 50th and 75th quantile
regressions did not converge, these regressions are estimated at the 50.5th and 74.5th quantile.
