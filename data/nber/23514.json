    "abstract": "\n\nMortality is a crucial indicator of wellbeing and recent mortality trends have been a subject of public debate in many Western countries. This paper compares mortality inequality in Canada and the U.S. over the period 1990/91 through 2010/11. In Canada, mortality inequality remained constant among the youngest, but increased for men over 24 and for women over 14. In contrast, in the U.S. mortality inequality fell for children and youth, while at older ages it either modestly decreased or held steady. By 2010/11 the initially higher U.S. rates of infant and child mortality had almost converged to their Canadian counterparts.\n\n",
