WAGES, PROFITS AND
REIC-SHARINO

ABSTRACT

The paper uses CPS data from 1964 to 1985 to test for the existence of rent-sharing in
US tabor markets, Using an unbatanced panel from the manufacturing sector, and random-effects

and fixed-effects specifications, the paper finds that changes in wages are explained by
movements in lagged levels of profitability and unemployment. The results appear to be
consistent with rent-sharing theory (or a labor contract framework with risk-averae finns) and to
be inconsistent with the competitive labor market model. The paper estimates the unemployment
elasticity of pay at approximately -0.03, and the profit elasticity of pay at between 0.02 and 0.05.

Wages, Profits and Rent-Sharing
1,_Introduction

One of the oldest questions in economics is that of whether the market for labor can be
represented satisfactorily by a standard competitive modeL The importance of this question, which

has implications for macroeconomics as well as labor economics, has stimulated much earlier
research and more than a little controversy. The purpose of this paper is to blend microeconornic

data on wages with industrial data on profits to produce a new test of the competitive market

hypothesis. The results of the study suggest that, contrary to the implications of competitive
theory, US pay determination exhibits elements of rent-sharing.

In a prominent early attack on traditional analysis, Sumner Slichter (1950) argued that a
competitive model fails to explain the empirical evidence that apparently homogenous types of

employee earn significantly different amounts in different industries, His data, drawn from the
US manufacturing sector, showed that wages appeared to be positively correlated with various

measures of the employer's 'ability to pay'.

Slichier concluded that this con elation provides

prima fade evidence against a conventional competitive model. Recent researth into this issue by
Dickens and Katz (1987), Krueger and Summers (1987, 1988) and Katz and Summers (1989) has

reached the same conclusion using better data than were available in Slichter's time. Equivalent
findings emerge from new work on European labor markets by, for example, Blanchflower era!
(1990), Beckerman and Jenkinson (1990), Carruth and Oswald (1989), Holmlund and Zetterberg

(1991), Denny and Machin (1991), and Nickell and Wadhwani (1990). The Canadian results of
Christofides and Oswald (1992) point to the same conclusion.
Almost all of these studies estimate rnicmeconometric wage equations and examine whether

variables such as profitability enter positively and significantly in those equations. Such results, it

is argued, imply that a competitive version of labor market theory is rejected because, in an

atomistic wage-taking environment, high profits in a firm or industry should not affect the
competitive requirement that employers pay neither more nor less than the going wage in the
external labor market, An employer who offered epsilon above that market rate should -- whether

2

or not high profits make such a wage feasible -- be flooded with job applicants from other sectors.
In a competitive framework, an employer's ability to pay ought to have no effect upon the earnings

of its workers. There ought to be no rent-sharing.

The primary purpose of this paper is to examine whether, in US manufacturing industry,

there is evidence that wages depend upon the employer's ability to pay. It appears to be the first
US study to do so in a way that can connnl for industry fixed effects(l). A second purpose of the

paper is to argue that, conary to what has sometimes been asserted, the existence of some forms

of positive correlation between wages and profitability would not automatically disprove
competitive theory. Later sections derive three models in which a positive wage-profit correlation

is to be expected; two of these models do not have non-competitive or rent-sharing features. The
paper attempts to discuss the kind of wage-pmfit correlations that could be used to throw light on
the usefulness of the cooipetive model.

Section 2 studies the interactions between wages and profits in three different models.
Section 3 contains the empirical results: it estimates US manufacturing earnings equations. Section
4 summarizes the paper's conclusions, and the Appendix describes the data.

2, Models of the Wage-Profit Correlation
The textbook model of a competitive labor market implies that finns are wage-takers whose

profitability will not affect the wage that they offer to homogeneous employees. This is the
assumption of an infinitely elastic supply of labor.
By contrast, the paper proves the following analytical results.

1. In a competitive model, given an upward-sloping labor supply curve, there is a positive short-

run correlation between wages and profits. There may also be a positive correlation between

l An exception is the new paper by Steve Allen (1992), which we saw after this project had been
largely completed. He finds that price-cost margins come in negative in a log wage equation.

However, he does not look explicitly at the role of total profits or profits per worker. An
interesting and relatively neglected paper that is close to being a further exception is Sparks and
Wilton (1971), which finds profit effects in a form of micro Phillips curve,

3

wages and profit per employee: a sufficient condition for this is that the elasticity of labor demand
be less than unity. There is no long-nm relation between wages and profit variables.

2. In a labor contract model (with symmetric information) in which both workers and the r are
risk-averse, profits and wages are positively correlated. The elasticity of wages with respect to
profits equals the ratio of the parties' relative risk-aversion parameters.

3. In a bargaining model with rent-sharing, there is a positive partial correlation between wages
and profit per employee, and a negative partial correlation between wages and unemployment.
These are long-run correlations in the sense thaL they exist in steady-state equilibrium.

The theoretical results establish that evidence of co-movement between pay and profitability

is not, in itself, proof of the existence of rent-sharing. The remainder of this section sets out the
proofs of the propositions stated above. Three models of wage determination are considered. The
first is a bargaining framework in which rents are divided between the finn and its employees; the
second is a competitive model in which the short run industry supply curve of labor slopes up; the
third is an optimal labor contract model under which risk-sharing occurs,
Three Models

Consider a bargaining model in which rents exist and are divided between workers and the

employer. Assume that wages are determined as if by a Nash problem in which 4 is the
bargaining power of employees. Write this maximization problem as

Maximise ,log{[u(w)—u()n}+(l—4t)logt
where u(w) is the worker's utility from wage w, W is the wage available from temporary work in
the event of a breakdown in bargaining. n is employmentb and it is profits. This formulation relies

on the assumption that in the event of bargaining delay the firm earns zero profit and the worker
wage W, and by the choice of units the variable n is also the probability of employment. Define

profits as f(n)-wn, where f is a concave revenue function. The maximization's solution must be
such that each side earn at least what is available as an outside option.
At an interior optimum, the foilowing first order conditions hold;

(4)

This can be simplified using the first-order Taylor approximation

ur) u(w)+ (;— w)u' (w)

(5)

Combining (4) and (5):

w+

(6)

This equation shows that, to a ru-sc-order approximation, the equilibrium wage is determined by the

outside wage available in the event of a temporary dispute in bargaining, the relative bargaining
strength of the two sides, and the level of profit-per-employee.
Equation (6) is more general than might at first be apparent Because it stems only from the

first of the two first-order conditions, equation (6) is true independently of the nature of the
employment function. In particular, it does not depend on whether employment is fixed along a
labor demand curve or an efficient-bargaining locus.

A conventional assumption about the underlying determinants of W, the outside temporary

wage, is that it can be described by the function c(w0, b, U), where w0 is the going wage in other

sectors of the economy, b is she level of income when unemployed, and U is the unemployment

rate among workers of the type employed by the flrnt A natural interpretation of the algebra is
that W is expected income and U determines the probability of receiving b rather than wt. Written

in fall, therefore,

5

(7)

In a regression equation for (7), estimated on longitudinal data, year dummies are likely to capture
wt and b, leaving unemployment U and profit-per-employee st/n as the key explanatory variables.

At the other extreme from a bargaining model lies competitive theory. It is of interest to

examine whether this, too, can imply a positive co-movement of wages and profztability(2).
Because the focus is the relationship between wages and profits, it is convenient to define a
maximum profit function
st(j.t, w) = max[ii.f(n)

—

wn]

(8)

where employment, n, is chosen to maximize the difference between revenue and labor costs, and
f(n) is a concave production function. js is a demand shock (or output price) variable, and w is the

wage. The function itQ.t,w) is convex and homogenous of degree one in the prices ..t and w. The
later analysis will assume that the function is twice differentiable.

Assume that st(jJ,w) represents the profit of the representative firm within an industry. By
an appropriate choice of units. the long-run equilibrium level of profits can be set as stQ.t,w) = 0.
This is the usual convention that profits be written net of some required return to the enu-eprencur

who runs the finn.
In this framework there is a labor demand curve defined by the derivative of the maximum

profit function with respect to wages. Assume that there is also a labor supply function 1(w)

which may be upward-sloping in the short-run but which is horizontal in the long-run. This
captures the competitive notion that, although in the long-run there should be free entry along a
perfectly ela.sdc labor supply curve, in the short-run there may be frictions that cause wages to be

bid up by a demand shock.
Equilibrium in this market is given by the equation

The right hand side of equation (17) is non-negative. It is strictly positive if either

correlated.
A natural question to ask is that of whether there is also, within the competitive framework,

a positive correlation between profit-per-employee and the wage. The answer is that there may be
such a relationship.

Profit per employee is given by the ratio of profit to the wage-derivative of the profit

Using the definition of the elasticity of labor demand, combined with equation (13), the inequality

in (27) is guaranteed to hold if the labor demand elasticty is below unity. Hence, a sufficient
condition for the term in square brackets in equation (24) to be positive is that the elasticity of labor

demand be less than unity3.

The final model to be cunsidered is a generalization of the Rally (1974) and Azariadis
(1975) optimal contract framework. In this the firm and workers are assumed to reach an implicit

contract in which wages are set to provide efficient 'insurance' against random demand shocks.

equal to Rio but in this case the sum of the first two terms in equation (24) is unambiguously

Although the original articles assumed that firms are risk-neutrai, and thus obtained the result that

wages should be rigid, that assumption can be generalized to allow the firm to be averse to risk.
The model then predicts a positive correlation between pay and profitability.
A labor contact model can be represented as the following maximization problem:

(31)

The solution is a wage function w4t) defined on demand shocks. Implicit in the above formuistion

are the following assumptions. First, the firm's utility depends upon profits and can be
represented by a concave function v(jt). Second, the worker receives utility u(w) when employed

and u(b) when unemployed. Normalizing the sue of the labor pool to unity, the probability of

employment is n and of unemployment 1-n. Assume that there is no private unemployment
insurance and that b is exogenously given (in line with the (iS data reported in Oswald (1986)).
Demand shocks here follow a probability density function g(.t). Firms must offer their employees
the market level of expected utility.

which is strictiy positive if both parties are suicily risk-averse, is undefined if workers are risk-

(1974) and Azariadis (1975).

Assume that workers relative risk-aversion is r and the firm's relative risk-aversion is Q.
Then, combining (32) and (34),

In words, the elasticity of wages with respect to profits is equal to the ratio of the firm's relative

risk-aversion to the workers' relative risk-aversion. Here the firm and its employees choose to
share the risk of demand fluctuations, so that wages and profits move together.

To summarize, the extreme competitive model, with instantaneous entry and exit of
workers, implies that finns' wages wiU be unaffected by profit shocks. Intuition suggests that this
result will disappear when frictions are introduced into the competitive framework, and this section

formalizes that intuition. The testable characteristic of a competitive theory therefore becomes the

hypothesis that long-mn wage levels do not respond to profit movements. By contrast, there is a

tong-run relationship between pay and profits in either a rent-sharing model or a labor contract
framework with risk-averse firms.
The remainder of the paper is an attempt to confront these theoretical hypotheses with data

from the United States, Because no suitable matched microeconomic data exist -- reporting

information both about employees and their empluyers --

it is necessary to splice together

microeconomic data on individuals with industry-level profits data.

3. Results
This paper uses data on approximately 400,0(X) workers in US manufacturing industry.
The data are drawn from the March tapes of the Current Population Survey (CPS). and cover the

years 1964 to l985(). Although micro earnings equations at the level of the individual can be

asked to report their earnings in the previous year. Thus, for example. 1964 earnings are derived

11
esumated directly on this sample (see Blanchilower and Oswald, 1992), the focus of interest is the

impact of profitability, and this makes it necessary to take a different approach. To avoid the
aggregation problems identified by Moulton (1986), which result in the standard errors in Lhese
kinds of micro-equations being artificially small, and to exploit the availability of industrial profit
statistics, the data were converted into a panel of cell means. This satisfies Moulton's condition that

the level of aggregation should be the same on both sides of the regression equation. The reported

regressions, therefore, use an unbalanced panel of 19 industries by 22 years4 giving 394
observations in all. Details of the industries covered are outlined in the Appendix. The dependent

variable and all of the independent variables with the exception of the the year dummies are the
calculated year/industry cell means from the underlying UPS data. The industry unemployment and

profit data were merged from external sources and are also described in the Appendix (see also
Sanfey, 1992). In our estimation we use unweighted data(s).

An application of the rent-sharing bargaining model is estimated in Table 1. This is a
version of equation (7), The Table includes a set of individual control variables, These variables,

which are traditionally incorporated in earnings equations, are assumed here to capture
compositional effects of a kind omitted from the theoretical model based on a single kind of
worker. The control variables are all measured as the proportion present in an industry/year cell

and include avenge years of experience (the square was never significant), average number of
years of schooling, percentage female, a set of variables distinguishing marital status and racial
mix, the proportion of individuals employed in the private sector, the proportion part-time, and a
full set of year dummies.

from the 1965 UPS. The use of an unbalanced panel was nccessitatcd because of coding
differences across the years in the industry variables.

5. There is some support in the llterature for such an approach. For example. Dickens (1990)
shows that it is inappropriate to weight because individual en'or terms are likely to be correlated
due to group-specific error components, which means that weighting by say, the square root of
group size is inappropnate.

12

Table 1 takes as the dependent variable the logarithm of workers' income in each industry

by calendar year calculated from the aggregated CPS March files. Earnings equations for US

manufacturing industry are estimated from 1964-1985. The dependent variable is entered in
nominal terms; the price level, and other aggregate effects, are effectively subsumed into the year
dummies. The first three columns of the Table are estimated by Ordinary Least Squares; the fourth
is estimated by a one-way fixed-effects model while the fifth column is estimated using a one-way
random effects panel estimator(6) The models estimated are of the general form

y11=p1+xj+Ej,

(36)

where E{E1—0 and varfr,] = a. In the fixed effects model p isa separate constant term for
each unit. This model may be written

= a1d, + a2d,-t-, ..+' a, + e1,

(37)
(38)

where the as's are industry-specific constants and the di's axe dummy variables which are 1 only

when j=1. In the random effects model (REM) p is an indusb'y specific disturbance. This model
is as follows
(39)
where E[ui] = 0, Var[uj] =oj, Cov[4,u11 = 0. All disturbances have variance

Varkfr÷ujoa+a

(40)

but for a given i, the disturbances are correlated,

ConTe+ui,,E,.+uI=p=aIeT1

(41)

The efficient estimator is OLS. The variance components are first estimated with LIMOEP using

the residuals from an OLS regression. Then feasible GLS estimates are computed using the
estimated variances (see Green, 1990, chapter 16 and Hsiao, 1990, chapter 6).

Each of the earnings equations in Table 1 includes explanatory variables for profits per
employee, industry unemployment and lagged earnings. The last of these is a conventional lagged

against both the fixed effects and one-way random effects models.

13
dependent variable. Unemployment is entered at the industry level and as a logarithm. In column
I of Table 1 lagged earnings and profits axe included in an OLS regression along with only a set of

21 year dummies. In column 2 the unemployment rate is added, followed by a series of worker
characterisdcs variables in column 3. Column 4 includes the group fixed effects and column 5 is

the random-effects model. Both Hausman's Chi-square and the Breusch-Pagan Lagrange
multiplier statistics provide tests between the specifications and favor the random effects model. In
what follows all estimation uses the REM model.

The lagged dependent variable, which is also in log form, falls in size from around 0.8 in

the first two columns to only 0.14 in column 3 and then to below 0.07 in columns 5 and 6. This
suggests that most of the auto-regression often found in wage equations is being picked up here by

the worker characteristics variables plus the industry-specific fixed effects. Because of the
smallness of the estimated coefficient on the lagged dependent variable in what follows, the long-

run elasticities are only (approximately) one tenth larger than the short-run elasticities. The longrun unemployment elasUeity, for example, is in absolute value no larger than 0.03, which suggests
that a cereris paribus doubling of an indusnys unemployment rate would be associated with a three

or four per cent drop in earnings. This is a little below the commonly-found elasticity of -0.1.
Blanchflower and Oswald (1990) contains a summary of recent estimates. The negativity of the
unemployment rate conforms to the prediction of the rent-sharing bargaining model. This effect
appears to be robust across many specifications, If there is any simultaneity bias, it should act to
make the coefficient smaller in absolute terms (that is, closer to a positive value).

Profit per employee is denoted by the symbol it/n. When entered contemporaneously in the

full specifications of columns 4 and 5 of Table 1, profit per employee has a coefficient of 0.0022
with a t-statistic of approximately 2.3, The variable It/n is not entered as a log (because it takes the

occasional negative value). To convert to an elasticity in this semi-log equation, therefore, it is
necessary to multiply by the mean of the independent variable. The mean of it/n over the period is

approximately 10, so this implies that the short-mn profit elasticity of earnings is approximately
0.02, and the long-run elasticity is approximately 0.025.

14

Although later Tables discuss variants on these results, Table 1 conveys the main findings

of the paper. As predicted by the rent-sharing model of equation (7), wages are positively
correlated with profitability per employee and negatively correlated with the unemployment rate in

the relevant industry. While this result comes through in an OLS specification without any
controls, such as column 2 of Table 1, the parameter estimates generated in that way appear to be

too large. The favored specification, the random effects model of column 5, has a much smaller
coefficient on lagged wages, and coefficients on unemployment and profits-per-employee that are
less than half those in the OLS specification of column 2.

It is not easy to see how these estimates could be compatible with the competitive labor

market framework. The only possibility appears to be the nne discussed earlier in the paper,
namely, that temporary frictions could induce a short-term positive correlation between profits and

pay. To investigate this issue it is necessary to examine the autoregressive structure of profits
within wage equations.

Colurrms 1, 2, and 3 of Table 2 keep current profit per employee as a regressor, and add
respectively profit per employee lagged one year, two years and three years. These maintain the
random-effects specification. In each case the contemporaneous profit variable is statistically weak

whilst the lagged value is precisely estimated. The sum of the profit coefficients is approximately

0.0035 in each of the equations I and 2 in Table 2. In column 3 it exceeds 0.0045. Columns 4-6
conduct the further experiment of removing the current profit variable, and the results are similar.
The large coefficient on profits three years ago seems to be noteworthy; it is both larger and more
precisely estimated than the more recent profit variables. At the mean, the long-run unemployment

elasticity of profits-per-employee in column 6 is approximately -0.04. In column 7 all three lags
are included, with the first and third positive and significant.

Table 3 keeps the same general form but allows for more complex lagged profit-peremployee terms. Columns 1 and 2 show profit terms going insignificant-- presumably because of
collinearity -- although in each case the coefficients continue to sum to approximately 0.003. This
is not, however, the natural or robust specification. Specifications 3-7 reveal the robustness of the

15
profiL term three years earlier. There is soot indication that a change in profits (between t-1 and t-

2) enters positively. However, the main result here appears to be that the sum of the profit
coefficients is reliably close to 0.004. Again this implies that, at the mean, a doubling of profit per

employee increases earnings by approximately five per cent. Because of the volatility of the n/n
variable, this is quantitatively important
Total indusn'y profits, it, are used as an independent variable in Table 4. It can be seen that

statistically this is nearly as well-defined as per capita profit (Table 1), and the direction of the
effects is the same. The first three columns of the Table omit personal control variables, and the

final three include them. There is little to choose between the results obtained using the fixed

effects or the random effects model (columns 5 and 6 respectively). As found in Table I,
however, the REM model is preferred statistically on the basis of the Breusch-Pagan and Hausman

teats. Consequently, the REM model is used in Tables 5 and 6.

Table 5 switches exclusively to a specification with total profits and no unemployment
variable. The thrust of the results is the same as in the earlier tabtes, but some of the details differ.

Lagged profits have consistently small coefficients when entered simultaneously with current
profit. Total profit in the current period has a coefficient of approximately 0.00004 to 0,00005,
and is well-defined. As the mean of industry profit is $500m. approximately, the short-run profit
elasticity of earnings is approximately 0.02. The lagged dependent variable continues to be small,

so the long-run elasticity is only slighter larger than its short-mn value. Table 6 sets out more
complex dynamic forms in a format symmetric to Table 3.

Tables 4-6 correspond to the competitive and labor contract equation given as (17) and
(34). They use total profitability, in other words, rather than profit-per-head as an independent
variable.

Imagine an exogenous rise in demand for the products of industry j. Under the assumption
of a competitive labor market with frictions, profits it) and wages wJ will at first rise together. The

correlation is induced by the outward shift in the demand curve for labor in industryj. However,
workers of a given skill are then being rewarded more highly in industryj than in other sectors of

the economy. The resulting inward migration of workers must, by competitive logic, eventually
eliminate the wage gain. A blip in profits therefore, can have no long-mn effect on pay.

This prediction appears to be systematically violated by the data. Of the thirty-nine
estimated equations in Tables l-& only four give any support so the view that profitability variables
have no long run effect, and these four are statistically dominated by the other specifications.

The labor contract model of equations (29)-(35) offers an alternative interpretation of the
data, and one that falls in the gap between competitive theory and the rent-sharing model. Equation

(35) is a steady-state relation, capturing how wages vary in the contract as demand changes, and

thus is immune to the criticism that the Tables reveal long-mn effects from profit shocks. This
model has no supernormal expected returns, so differs from the rent-sharing framework. Potential
disadvantages are that it requires us to believe that individuals are between 20 and 50 times more
risk-averse than firms (to be consistent with profit elasticities of pay of 0.02-0.05) and that it fails
to explain why wages should react to industry unemployment.
One further check was done. It could be that the statistical significance of profitability in the

wage equation stems merely from the existence of rent-sharing in certain high-wage heavily

unionized pans of US manufacturing. Table 7, however, appears to cast doubt on that
interpretation. Is re-estimates the equations of Table I using a sub.sample of industries with low
wages. These are the eight industries -- their identities are listed below Table 7 -- that pay below
the mean level of earnings in the overall sample. Although this procedure inevitably reduces the

number of observations (n=164), Table 7 continues to show evidence of the influence of profitper-employee upon workers' remuneration. The coefficient on the profit variable in Table 7 varies

from 0.0029 with at-statistic of 2.8 to 00112 with at-statistic of 3.47. Unemployment remains
negative but is not well-determined.

Table 7 thus confirms the paper's main finding. Even within a subsample of industries
with low levels of pay, there appears to be evidence of rent-sharing in US wage determination.

17

4. Conclusions

The principal finding of this paper is that wage determination in United Stales
manufacturing industry appears to be better explained by a rent-sharing model than by a
competitive framework. Controlling for industry fixed effects, and a range of personal and
compositional variables, the paper shows that changes in workers' remuneration occur, in part, in

response tn earlier movements in profltability(). When firms become more prosperous, workers
eventually receive some of the gains. This is the central prediction of non-competitive theories in
which rents are divided between firms and workers.

The paper considers potential flaws in this kind of empirical test. It shows that wages and
profits may exhibit co-movement in a variety of circumstances:

(i) in a modified competitive model where, because of frictions, labor supply temporarily slopes
upwards;
(ii) in an optimal contract model in which workers and the employer are risk-averse;
(iii) in a bargaining framework in which there are non-competitive rents.

The first of these, however, is not compatible with the existence of a lone-run association between

earnings and profitability. It is this property that is the ultimate reason for the papess rejection of

competitive theory. There is evidence in these data of a long-run or steady-state relationship

between remuneration and industrial profitability, and of fairly long lags on the key profit
variables. These facts suggest that model (iii) fits the data most naturally(S).

The paper also discusses the properties of model (ii) in which there is an optimal implicit
contract between risk-averse employees and a risk-averse employer. Taken literally, the empirical

estimates suggest thaL the ratio of the parties' relative rates of risk-aversion is between 0.02 and
7. There are, of course, other sources of information on a wage-profit correlation, and some
industrial relations researchers are likely to see these results as establishing statistically a
relationship that they have observed many times in actual wage-setting. Btanchflower and Oswald
(1988) documents direct questionnaire evidence of this type. Field experiments like those in
Bazerman (1985) point in the same direction. For a recent survey of explanations for industry
wage differentials, see Oroshen (1991).

.

As this paper was being completed Jim Malcolmson convinced us that his new paper Macleod
and Malcolmson (1993) may also generate a wage-profit relationship.

18
0.05, which implies that US workers are twenty to fifty times as risk-averse as the firms for which

they work. A criticism of this interpretation of the estimated wage equations is that it fails to
explain why the rent-sharing specification (model (iii)) does so well. Nevertheless, the labor
contact model appears to be broadly consistent with the data, out-performs a standard competitive
framework, and seems to deserve attention in future research.

Apoendix. Description of Profit Variables

The profit variable (Sanfeys variable Proflt3c) is derived as follows
value added - gymli

0'I

- real depreciation - (real interest rate*reai capital stock)

For a detailed explanation of how these variables are derived see Sanfey (1992, Appendix 2) and

Gray (1989). Our sample is restricted to individuals employed in manufacturing for the period
1963-1985. Average real profits and per capita real profits for the longer period 1958-1985 are

available at the 4-digit level for each of these years, in 1972 dollars (deflator =CPI), We
aggregated these profit data to the two digit level for each year and them mapped them onto nur
CPS data files. Below we report the average level of profits and the average per capita profits for
the longer period 1958-1985 in constant 1972 dollars.
