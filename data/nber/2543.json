We show that shifting the composition of government spending affects macroeconomic variables according to the relative factor intensities of tradeable and non-tradeable goods. Adjustments of composition towards non-tradeables will raise (lower) world interest rates if non-tradeables are capital (labor) intensive. The announcement of a future shift towards non-tradeables will induce a current account deficit (surplus) if future interest rates are expected to increase (decrease). The introduction of production thus places restrictions on the co-movements of fiscal policy and macroeconomic variables beyond those generated by preferences.\n\n",
