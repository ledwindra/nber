Does It Matter If Statistical Agencies Frame the Month’s CPI Reporton a 1-Month or 12-month
Basis?

ABSTRACT
When the US Bureau of Labor Statistics releases new numbers, in theory it should make no
difference whether the press release emphasizes the most recent 1-month number, which is what
it always does, or the 12-month number, as many other countries’ statistical agencies do. This
paper offers the hypothesis that it does matter: Markets react to CPI inflation news via whichever
framing the agency has adopted.

Official statistical agencies report GDP numbers every quarter and industrial production,
inflation, and various employment measures every month. The complete statistical report that
is released and posted on agency websites contains a lot of information. But in the United
States, the agency’s website and the headline and/or lead sentence of the agency’s press
release clearly and consistently emphasize the figure for the most recent period: the most
recent quarter for the rate of growth in GDP and the most recent month for the CPI, Industrial
Production, or employment (change from the previous month). In many other countries, the
website and the headline or lead sentence of the press release emphasize instead the change
over the preceding one-year interval – such as Canada and most European countries for CPI
inflation, China and Taiwan for the GDP growth rate, Switzerland for industrial production, or
Japan and Korea for change in employment.1
Economists’ logic would say that it cannot make any difference what the agency chooses
to emphasize in the website or press release that it gives to journalists and the public, so long
as all the information is made available at the same time (including the estimate for the most
recent period, revised numbers for one or more preceding periods, and the number for the
preceding 12-months or 4 quarters). A standard criterion for the efficiency of financial markets
is that they process all available government statistics. But the hypothesis explored in this
paper is that it does make a difference, that financial markets tend to react relatively more
strongly to the most recent number in countries such as the United States and to react
relatively more strongly to the 12-month number in countries where that is the one
emphasized in the press release.
Macroeconomists steeped in the literature on statistical effects of government
announcements may find the proposed outlook unfamiliar.2 The hypothesis will be less
There are also other systematic differences in the way that governments report statistics in different
countries. In the United States, quarterly GDP growth rates are compounded to express them at annual
rates, approximately equal to multiplying the quarterly numbers by four. Europeans and others do not
compound or multiply by four. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), on the other hand, does not
compound the percentage change in the CPI or PPI nor multiply by 12 in its press releases; as a result,
inflation news reports usually headline an uninformative 0.1% number, for everything between 0.6%
p.a. and 1.8% p.a. (i.e., between 0.05% and 0.15% per month). There are also international reporting
differences with respect to headline versus core, seasonally adjusted versus not, etc. This paper is
concerned only with the question of whether the releases emphasize the most recent period versus the
last year.

The necessary mental adjustment is perhaps analogous to what was needed 30 years ago to get
macroeconomists interested in real-time government announcement effects in the first place. Some
reactions were along the lines “why should we be interested in original announcements in dusty

surprising to those familiar with the evidence on psychological biases of framing and anchoring
that has made its way into behavioral economics.3 It may also be less surprising to market
traders themselves, who do not feel they have the time to read the entire statistical release
before rushing to participate in the market reaction. Given that the United States is the country
that seems consistently to emphasize the most recent period in its statistical releases, the
hypothesis considered here may also be of interest to those who believe that US financial
markets suffer from “short-termism.”4
Others have noted possible evidence of over-reaction to short-term noise, for example
the fact that markets react strongly to the preliminary estimate of GDP but not to subsequent
revisions. Well-targeted tests are hard to construct, however.
Bartolini, Goldberg and Sacarny (2008) are among those noting that the markets react
to the advanced estimate of GDP but not noticeably to the revisions. This is important because
Mankiw and Shapiro (1986), Faust, Rogers and Wright (2005), and others have documented
that changes from the US flash estimate to the preliminary estimate, and from preliminary to
revised, are usually large in magnitude. The market reactions don’t necessarily prove
irrationality or over-reaction, however, because the incremental value in each of the revisions
might still be too small, when the first advanced number (even though highly imperfect) is
already known. But it is highly suggestive that the Bureau of Economic Analysis stopped
altogether reporting the preliminary flash estimate after 1985.5 Whatever useful information
there had been in the early estimate was apparently considered to be of less value than the
danger that the public would read too much into a measure that BEA considered very noisy.

archives, when we have the correct revised numbers?” (A particular version of the rational expectations
hypothesis had in effect held that economic agents intuit the true state of the economy, so that real
time releases regarding economic statistics subject to subsequent revision would not be of interest.)

Reporting practices in different countries
Table 1 shows the CPI reporting practices of different countries, as between mostrecent-period versus 12-month change, and the corresponding reporting tendencies across
countries of the important financial wire services (Bloomberg and Reuters). The United States
is the country where the news clearly and consistently focuses on CPI inflation for the most
recent month. The statistical agencies in Korea also give it emphasis. Correspondingly, the
news services Bloomberg/World Process and Reuters tend to give greater emphasis to the
month’s number from the US, and somewhat less to the 12-month inflation rate. Most other
countries do this differently. Canada and most European countries emphasize CPI changes on a
12-month basis in the official statistical reports. Bloomberg and Reuters follow suit in most of
these countries.
Appendix Tables 1A and 1B report the corresponding information for GDP nd
employment reporting practices. For GDP growth, the US has a lot more company in its shorttermism. A majority of countries, including the UK, Canada, Japan, and the Eurozone,
emphasize growth in the most recent quarter. The news outlets tend to do the same for these
countries, reporting the most recent quarter. China and Taiwan, on the other hand, report GDP
growth with an emphasis on the 4-quarter basis. In these two countries the media outlets
again follow suit (Bloomberg and Reuters).6

Baum, Kurov and Wolfe (2015) find that announcements of GDP and 11 other Chinese variables move
stock markets worldwide.

Reactions in bond markets
Statistical findings of jumps in interest rates in response to inflationary news, with a
highly significant positive correlation, go back to the early 1980s, a time when Federal Reserve
announcements of money supply numbers were important: Grossman (1981), Roley (1983),
Urich and Wachtel (1981), Urich (1982), Naylor (1982), Cornell (1982), Engel and Frankel (1982,
1984), and Campbell, Schoenholtz and Shiller (1983). More recent papers, able to take
advantage of larger and higher-frequency datasets, have similarly found interest rates rising or
bond prices falling in reaction to news of higher inflation or stronger economic growth. They
include Fleming and Remolona (1999), Goldberg and Leonard (2003), Ehrmann and Fratscher
(2005), Gurkaynak, Sack and Swanson (2005), Andersen, Bollerslev, Diebold and Vega (2007),
Faust, Rogers, Wang and Wright (2007), Paiardini (2014), Gilbert, Scotti, Strasser and Vega
(2016) and Strasser (2017), among others.
We now examine the patterns of reaction in the bond markets of different countries. In
this study, we focus on the effects of CPI announcements on the one-day change in 10-year
bond prices, comparing them before and after the announcement. One could also look at the
reactions in stock markets and foreign exchange markets.7 But theory is ambiguous as to the
predicted direction of reaction in those two markets: on the one hand, higher inflation itself
should be bad news for the foreign exchange value of the domestic currency but, on the other
hand, the likelihood that the monetary authority will react to the news by tightening is good
news for the value of the currency. The same ambiguity applies to stock market reactions.
We could also look at the financial market reactions to official announcements of GDP,
employment, or other measures of economic activity. But, again, there is a theoretical
ambiguity. To the extent that news of strong growth raises interest rates, it should have a
negative effect on bond prices, stock prices, and the exchange rate (price of foreign currency).
But in each case there are also effects that go the other way (respectively: default risk, earnings
growth, and the demand for money). Sure enough, others’ studies of the effect of inflation
and other economic announcements tend to find weaker effects on equity and foreign
exchange markets than on bond markets and to explain this in terms of the ambiguous
theoretical effect. To quote Bartolini, Goldberg and Sacarny (2008, p.2): “…the strongest
effects are seen on interest-bearing assets…The effects of economic news on stock prices are

E.g., Andersen, Bollerslev, Diebold and Vega (2007), Evans and Lyons (2005), Galati and Ho (2003),
Love and Payne (2008), Koch and Yung (2016), and Caporale, Guglielmo, Spagnolo and Spagnolo (2016).
It is a large literature. Studies of short-term reactions to monetary releases, for example, go back at least
to Pearce and Roley (1985) in the stock market and to Engel and Frankel (1982, 1984) in the foreign
exchange market. Neely and Dey (2010) survey the latter literature.

ambiguous.”

† Surprise =announcement minus forecast. The forecast is from an average of analysts' forecasts of that
number (MoM or YoY) before the announcement (source: Bloomberg).
Sample period (by month of release)
Canada: February 2003 - August 2014
Korea: Feb 2004 - Dec 2013
UK: Dec 2003 - August 2014
US: February 2003 - August 2014

Table 2 above reports the results of regressions of the reactions to CPI releases of prices
of 10-year bonds in four countries (% change of 10-year government bond price). The new CPI
number is expressed as the difference from the forecast made immediately before the release.
The forecast is measured as the average of analysts’ forecasts compiled by Bloomberg. In line
with much research on announcement effects (“news” or “event studies”), what should matter
is the announcement relative to what the market had been expecting. The first right-hand side
variable is the newly released CPI number for the most recent month. The other variable is the
newly released inflation rate over the preceding 12-months.
7

The first regression, in column 1, applies to data from two countries that emphasize the
12-month inflation rate in the headlines of their press releases: Canada and the United
Kingdom. The second regression, in column 2, applies to data from two countries that give
more emphasis to the most recent month’s CPI inflation: the US and Korea. Recall that all these
countries make all the information available, both 1-month and 12-month; we are
distinguishing the countries according to the headline habits of the statistical agencies in their
press releases.
This table offers some preliminary support for the hypothesis. In Canada and the UK the
expected reaction – the bond market falls when inflation is higher than expected – comes
entirely with respect to the change over the preceding 12 months, which is the one that these
authorities headline. The coefficient is negative and significant. But given that, as hypothesized
they pay no attention to the month-on-month number. Its coefficient is insignificant and the
sign is wrong. In the US and Korea, the signs are the other way around, as hypothesized: the
negative reaction of bond markets to inflation news comes in the form of the reaction to the
information about the latest month, though it narrowly misses being statistically significant (the
P-value is 0.14).
We have also estimated the equation for each country individually (Appendix Table 2B).
The findings are qualitatively similar. In the UK, it is again the 12-month number that has a
statistically significant negative effect, with higher significance now that the country is
considered on its own. But the significance of this coefficient in the case of Canada diminishes,
compared to Table 2 where the data were grouped together with the UK. In the US and Korea
it is again the month-on-month number that has the negative effect on bond prices, as
hypothesized. The significance level goes up (becoming almost statistically significant at the
10% level for Korea, with aP-value of 0.11) but down slightly for the US, compared to Table 2
where the two were grouped together. Higher-frequency data would allow a test with higher
power. Recall that studies with intra-daily data have found highly significant reactions to the
statistical releases; we are just trying to pin down what form the reaction takes.
These results are preliminary. Further research could extend the tests to other
statistical releases (measures of economic activity such as growth in GDP, industrial production,
trade balance, and employment) and to reactions in other markets (equities and foreign
exchange).
The highest priority should be to obtain data observed at a higher frequency: over an
hour or half-hour interval, before and after each announcement. So far we only have data
observed from one day to the next. But we know from the existing literature that reactions
that are strong over a short interval can get swallowed up over a one-day interval, because a lot
8

of other things happen in the course of the day in addition to the statistical release.8 Bartolini,
Goldberg and Sacarny (2008), for example, find that the size and significance of the effect
diminishes as one moves from the half-hour reaction, to a mid-day observation, to end-oftrading day, let alone over a 24-hour window: “the immediate effect can generally be measured
more precisely than the full-day impact” and “…the immediate effects of economic news on
asset prices are easier to assess than the full-day effects, because the accumulation of other
shocks to asset prices through the business day makes the identification of persistent effects
more difficult” (p.5).

Implications
No doubt these results require qualification. One theoretical possibility is that the most
recent observation could carry relatively more genuine information about the economy in some
countries than in others, and the statistical agencies could tailor their reporting tendencies in
response to this.9 But at this stage, the biggest qualification is that the data used here do not
allow a sufficiently powerful test. The hypothesis needs to be tested more extensively,
especially on higher-frequency datasets. It is also important to test the difference in impacts of
GDP and Industrial Production announcements.
If the results in Table 2 do turn out to hold up, then the implications will be striking. As
positive social science, the hypothesis is consistent with theories of framing and anchoring that
are familiar in behavioral economics.
But it also might be relevant in a very practical way for the choice of reporting practices
on the part of the US Bureau of Labor Statistics and Bureau of Economic Analysis and other
official statistical agencies around the world. The limited word space in a media headline and
limited cognitive space in human mental capacities are presumably the reasons for the
observed tendency for agencies and news services to choose to focus on one measure above
others: either the latest period or the 12-month average. Which focus is “best practice”?
There are reasons to deem the 12-month average more informative. It contains the
information in the latest month or quarter and more beyond that. Even in a world of full
rationality, the announcement of a 4-quarter average of GDP growth or a 12-month average of
Preliminary tests of GDP and employment releases, and reactions in other markets, have not yielded
very edifying results so far. This may be because of the coarseness of the one-day interval. Or it may be
because of the theoretical ambiguities mentioned above, which take hold when we move away from the
effect of inflation announcements on bond prices.

employment growth contains important new information in addition to the latest period’s
number: revisions in the preceding quarters or months, which are often substantial. Of course
these revisions are available elsewhere in the statistical release. But the hypothesis, and the
supporting evidence in Table 2, suggests that a single headline number receives far more
attention than other numbers in the release.
In addition, once we admit the likelihood of departures from full rationality, we must
recognize that even if figures from previous months or quarters have not been revised, they
may fade from people’s awareness more quickly than is rational. We must consider that a
focus on the most recent month or quarter may lead financial market participants and others to
put too much weight on highly noisy short-term numbers, and to lose sight of the more
meaningful medium-term trend. A 12-month or 4-quarter average is an efficient way to convey
the recent trend. That much of the information in it was already available in the previous
period’s announcement of the one-year trend at that time does not necessarily mean that
observers do not need to be reminded of it, in order to gain a good fact-based perspective. A
12-month or 4-quarter change also carries the extra advantage of avoiding problems of
seasonal adjustment, which can sometimes be problematic.
If government statistical announcements could be made more informative, that could
have implications well beyond the financial markets studies in this paper. Firms’ hiring and
investment decisions depend on their perceptions of the current state of the economy. There
is even evidence that such decisions may respond more to the initial GDP releases, for example,
than to the “true” state of economic activity as captured by the final GDP numbers.
Making it easier for the public to gain perspective on the state of the economy could
have benefits as well for the participation of ordinary citizens in the political process. It is
possible that most people do not even bother to follow economic statistics because the shortterm noise is so great in what they hear or read that there is not much value in trying. Polls
indicated that four years after the end of the great recession in mid-2009, a heavy majority of
Americans thought that the country was still in recession.10 One could give other examples of
unawareness of economic statistics, from other stages in the business cycle and from other

If it were made easier for the public to get a genuine reading on the state of the economy, it
might help them in their lives as individual decision-makers in the economy and as voters in a
well-functioning democracy.
