ABSTRACT
Using panel structural VAR analysis and quarterly data from four industrialized countries, we document
that an increase in government purchases leads to an expansion in output and private consumption,
a deterioration in the trade balance, and a depreciation of the real exchange rate (i.e., a decrease in
the domestic CPI relative to the exchange-rate adjusted foreign CPI). We propose an explanation for
these observed effects based on the deep habit mechanism. We estimate the key parameters of the
deep-habit model employing a limited information approach. The predictions of the estimated deep-habit
model fit well the observed responses of output, consumption, the trade balance, and the real exchange
rate to an unanticipated government spending shock. In addition, the deep-habit model predicts that
in response to an anticipated increase in government spending consumption and wages fail to increase
on impact, which is consistent with the empirical evidence stemming from the narrative identification
approach. In this way, the deep-habit model reconciles the findings of the SVAR and narrative literatures
on the effects of government spending shocks.

Introduction

In this paper, we present the results of an empirical and theoretical investigation into the effects of
government spending shocks on consumption, output, the trade balance, and the real exchange rate.
Our empirical analysis uses quarterly data from a panel of four industrialized countries, the United
States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia, over the post-Bretton Woods period. We
employ a structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) representation of the data. Following Blanchard
and Perotti (2002), we identify government spending shocks by assuming that no innovation other
than government spending shocks themselves can affect government spending within the quarter.
We find that a positive innovation in government spending causes an expansion in output,
an expansion in consumption, a deterioration of the trade balance, and a depreciation of the real
exchange rate (that is, a decline in domestic prices relative to exchange-rate-adjusted foreign prices).
The effects of government spending shocks on domestic aggregate activity and private absorption
have been extensively studied in the related empirical literature. Our finding that government
spending shocks raise output and consumption is consistent with previous studies that have used
identification assumptions and estimation techniques similar to those we employ in the present
paper.1
By contrast, the effects of government spending shocks on the external sector of the economy,
and in particular on the real exchange rate, have received considerably less attention. A notable
exception is Monacelli and Perotti (2006). The main difference between our empirical strategy
and that adopted in Monacelli and Perotti is our pooling of data across countries. We justify a
panel analysis by observing that the identified effects of government spending shocks, particularly
on consumption and the real exchange rate, are similar across the individual countries considered.
The purpose of our panel approach is to obtain an efficient estimate of a single benchmark against
which to evaluate our proposed theoretical explanation of the transmission of government spending
shocks.
It is well known that the standard neoclassical model faces serious difficulties explaining the
observed expansion in private consumption in response to a positive innovation in government
spending. In effect, in this model an increase in government spending generates a negative wealth
effect that causes an increase in labor supply, a decline in real wages, and a contraction in household
spending. The observed real depreciation of the exchange rate following a positive government
spending shock is equally challenging for the neoclassical paradigm. In the absence of home bias,
an increase in public consumption generates no changes in international relative prices. As a result
the real exchange rate is unperturbed by the fiscal shock. With home bias, the relative price of
domestically produced goods in terms of foreign produced goods increases, causing the neoclassical
model to predict a counterfactual appreciation of the real exchange rate.
Our empirical findings pose a significant problem not only for the neoclassical model but also
for theoretical frameworks situated on the other end of the theoretical spectrum. Specifically, the

Mundell-Flemming extension to an open economy of the Hicksian IS-LM model, while capturing
the increase in consumption, fails to account for the observed real depreciation of the exchange rate
that follows an increase in public consumption. Within this framework, an increase in government
purchases produces an expansion in aggregate demand that drives interest rates up. In turn,
the elevated level of interest rates attracts foreign capital inflows, which increase the demand for
domestic currency resulting in a nominal appreciation of the exchange rate. With product prices
rigid in the short run, the nominal appreciation translates into a real appreciation. Furthermore,
more modern versions of the Mundell-Flemming IS-LM model with optimizing households and
firms and sluggish nominal price adjustment can be shown to fail to predict a real exchange rate
depreciation in response to a government spending increase.
A central contribution of our investigation is to advance and test a theoretical explanation for the
observed effects of government spending shocks based on the deep habit mechanism developed by
Ravn, Schmitt-Grohé, and Uribe (2006). To this end, we introduce deep habits into a two-country
model. Under deep habits, an increase in aggregate demand provides an incentive for firms to lower
markups. Thus, an increase in government spending in the domestic economy leads to a decline
in domestic markups relative to foreign markups. In this way, the domestic economy becomes less
expensive relative to the foreign economy, or, equivalently, the real exchange rate depreciates. At
the same time, a decline in domestic markups shifts the labor demand curve outward, giving rise
to an increase in domestic real wages. In turn, the rise in wages induces households to substitute
consumption for leisure. This substitution effect may be strong enough to offset the negative
wealth effect stemming from the increase in public absorption, resulting in an equilibrium increase
in private consumption.
We estimate the structural parameters defining the deep-habit mechanism using a limited information approach. We find substantial empirical support for the presence of deep habits in private
and public consumption. Moreover, the impulse responses of output, consumption, the trade balance, and the real exchange rate predicted by the deep-habit model match remarkably well in size
and shape their empirical counterparts.
The empirical literature on the effects of government spending shocks does not speak with
one voice. Thus far, we have discussed evidence stemming from a branch of the literature that
uses the Blanchard and Perotti (2002) identification scheme in the context of SVAR models. The
central finding of this strand of the literature, namely that consumption and real wages increase in
response to a positive government spending shock, has been challenged by an empirical literature,
pioneered by Ramey and Shapiro (1998), that employs a narrative approach to the identification of
government spending shocks. The narrative approach uses news sources to identify dates at which
agents learn about increases in government spending. Empirical studies employing the narrative
approach find that in response to an increase in government spending consumption and wages
fail to increase. These findings therefore stand in sharp contrast to those obtained by the SVAR
literature.
In this paper, we argue that the findings of the narrative and SVAR identification schemes do

2

not necessarily contradict each other. Our argument is based on the observation that the narrative
approach identifies mostly anticipated increases in government spending, whereas the SVAR approach identifies mostly unanticipated innovations in public spending. In effect, empirical studies
following the narrative approach find that typically government spending starts rising only two to
three quarters after news about the fiscal expansion becomes available. By contrast, under the
SVAR approach government spending shocks are by construction orthogonal to past information.
It follows that if under the transmission mechanism underlying the actual economy anticipated and
unanticipated shocks to public spending have different consequences, one should not expect the
estimated effects of fiscal shocks stemming from the narrative and SVAR approaches to coincide.
A successful theoretical explanation of the effects of government spending shocks must therefore
induce dynamics that are in line with those estimated using the SVAR and the narrative approaches
when perturbed by unanticipated and anticipated government spending shocks, respectively.
Indeed, we demonstrate that the predictions of the deep-habit model concerning consumption
and wages are consistent not only with the empirical facts stemming from the SVAR approach, but
also with those implied by the narrative methodology. Specifically, we show that in response to
news that government spending will rise two quarters hence consumption and real wages decline on
impact. That is, while the deep habit model predicts that consumption and wages rise in response
to an unanticipated increase in government spending, it at the same time implies that in response
to an anticipated government spending shock, consumption and wages decline.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 estimates econometrically the
effects of government spending shocks on output, consumption, the trade balance, and the real
exchange rate using a panel SVAR model. Section 3 presents a two-country model with deep habits.
Section 4 explains at an intuitive level how the deep-habit mechanism affects the transmission
of aggregate demand shocks. Section 5 describes the calibration of the nonestimated structural
parameters of the model. Section 6 presents the estimation of the structural parameters defining
the deep-habit mechanism. Section 7 compares the predicted and estimated impulse response
functions. Section 8 reconciles the evidence stemming from the SVAR and narrative approaches
through the lens of the deep-habit model. Section 9 explores the robustness of our findings to
changes in key structural parameters and detrending technique. Section 10 concludes.

The Observed Effects of Government Spending Shocks

where gt denotes real per capita government spending deflated by the GDP deflator, yt denotes
real per capita GDP, ct denotes real per capita private consumption of nondurables and services,
nxyt denotes the net export-to-GDP ratio, and et denotes the real exchange rate defined as the
ratio of a trade-weighted average of exchange-rate-adjusted foreign CPIs to the domestic CPI.2
According to our definition, an increase in et means that the real exchange rate of the domestic
country depreciates, or that the domestic country becomes cheaper relative to its trading partners.
A hat over a variable denotes the log deviation from trend, except for nxyt , for which it indicates
the level deviation from trend. All variables are seasonally adjusted, and detrended with a linear
and quadratic trend. The variable t is a mean-zero, serially uncorrelated vector of disturbances
with diagonal variance-covariance matrix Σ . The factor B(L) ≡ B0 + B1 L + B2 L2 + . . . denotes
a lag polynomial, with L denoting the lag operator. The matrices of coefficients Bi and A are of
size 5 by 5.
Following Blanchard and Perotti (2002), we identify innovations to government spending by
assuming that government spending responds with at least one-quarter lag to structural innovations
other than innovations to government spending itself. Formally, we impose that the first row of the
matrix A contains unity in its first element and zeros in all other elements.
We estimate the structural VAR pooling quarterly data from Australia, Canada, the United
Kingdom, and the United States. Our sample begins in the first quarter of 1975 and ends in
the fourth quarter of 2005. Our choice of countries is guided by our desire to limit attention
to industrialized countries, and by the availability of reliable quarterly data on aggregate private
consumption of nondurable goods and services and public consumption. We place emphasis on the
availability of quarterly data, because, in our view, the validity of the Blanchard and Perotti (2002)
identification strategy for government spending shocks depends crucially on the frequency at which
the data are observed. With lower-than-quarterly frequency data, such as annual data, it is much
less compelling to assume that within a period government spending cannot respond discretionarily
to contemporaneous innovations in aggregate activity. That is, at a lower-than-quarterly frequency,
one cannot be sure that the innovation to the ĝt equation is not a linear combination of all of the
structural innovations of the SVAR model.
The rationale for pooling data is to gain efficiency and to obtain a single benchmark against
which to evaluate the performance of our theoretical model to be presented in section 3. We estimate
the VAR system by OLS including country dummies. A potential concern with the panel VAR is
the inconsistency of the least squares parameter estimates due to the combination of fixed effects
and lagged dependent variables (e.g., Nickell, 1981). However, because the time series dimension of
our data is large (124 observations), the inconsistency problem is likely not to be a major concern.
We confirm that the size of the Nickell bias is small by Monte Carlo analysis.3 A different potential

The data source for government consumption, GDP, and net exports is the OECD national accounts section. The
source for the real exchange rate is the OECD Main Economic Indicators data base. And the sources for consumption
of nondurables and services are the national statistical offices of each particular country. Government consumption
is the sum of federal, state, and local public consumption spending.

Specifically, we carried out the following experiment. Given the OLS estimates of A, the lag polynomial B (L),
and the country fixed effects, we generated 10,000 artificial data series by bootstrapping the estimated errors. We

problem is the possibility of correlated residuals across countries. To gauge the importance of this
problem, we also computed impulse response functions from a feasible GLS estimation designed to
correct for contemporaneous cross-country correlations in the error terms. The resulting impulse
response functions (not shown) are fairly close to their OLS counterparts. Guided by the likelihood
ratio test proposed by Sims (1980), we allow for four lags in the SVAR specification.4
Our estimation procedure imposes that the matrices A and B(L) are the same across the four
countries from which we pool information. This simplifying assumption seems appropriate in light
of the fact that estimations using individual country data yield similar results for the dynamic
effects of government spending shocks on consumption and the real exchange rate. Our SVAR
specification is similar to the one estimated in Monacelli and Perotti (2006). Like these authors, we
consider data from the US, the UK, Canada, and Australia, and apply the Blanchard and Perotti
(2002) identification strategy. The main differences between our empirical approach and that of
Monacelli and Perotti is that we pool data, that we do not include taxes or the nominal interest
rate in the SVAR specification, and that our sample is 16 quarters longer per country.
Figure 1 displays with solid lines the impulse response function of government spending, output,
consumption, the net export-to-GDP ratio, and the real exchange rate to a unit innovation in
government spending. The figure depicts with broken lines a two-standard error band on each side
of the point estimate of the impulse response function computed using the delta method.5
The response of government spending is highly persistent, with a half life of about 5 quarters. A
one-percent increase in government spending raises output by 0.1 percent. Assuming a government
share of 19 percent (the average of government spending over the sample period for the four countries
in our sample), the government-spending multiplier, ∆yt /∆gt , is 0.52 on impact, indicating that
for each unit increase in public spending output increases by 0.52 units on impact.
Private consumption of nondurables and services experiences a persistent expansion following
the increase in public spending. This finding is in line with many other SVAR studies on the effects
of government spending. See, for example, Fatás and Mihov (2001) and Blanchard and Perotti
(2002). The finding that private consumption expands with government purchases is, however, not
uncontroversial. A strand of the literature identifies innovations in government spending using the
narrative approach (see Ramey and Shapiro, 1998). These studies find that in response to news
about upcoming military buildups consumption fails to increase (see, Ramey and Shapiro, 1998
and Burnside, Eichenbaum, and Fisher, 2004, among others). In section 8, we argue on theoretical
grounds that the effects of government spending shocks estimated using the SVAR and narrative
approaches are not necessarily at odds with each other.
The bottom left panel of figure 1 shows that the real exchange rate depreciates by one third
then estimated by OLS the pooled fixed effects VAR on each of the artificial data series and compared the point
estimates of the empirical impulse responses with the median estimates over the 10,000 Monte Carlo experiments.
The two estimates are very similar. The results are available from the authors upon request.
4
The test rejects the hypothesis of one or two lags in favor of a longer lag structure. We settle on a lag length of
four quarters to maintain comparability with the related literature. The three-lag and four-lag specifications yield
virtually identical impulse response functions and error bands.
5
The results are robust to using parametric or nonparametric bootstrap methods for computing error bands.

of one percent when the economy is hit by a one-percent increase in government spending. That
is, an expansion in public consumption causes the domestic country to become cheaper relative to
its trading partners. This result is at odds with the conventional wisdom, according to which an
expansion in government consumption is associated with an increase in domestic prices leading to
an appreciation of the real exchange rate. The empirical evidence typically drawn upon to support
the conventional view is based on raw correlations between government consumption and the real
exchange rate. The difficulty with this type of evidence is that, in principle, movements in the
real exchange rate and government spending may be driven by a multitude of shocks. By contrast,
the impulse responses shown in figure 1, isolate movements in all variables driven exclusively by
an innovation in government purchases. That is, the figure states that conditional on a positive
innovation in government spending the real exchange rate depreciates. It follows that the evidence
reported here and that emanating from the analysis of raw correlations are not necessarily contradictory. We note further that other empirical studies have also found that the real exchange
rate depreciates in response to a positive government spending shock. For example, Monacelli and
Perotti (2006) document this fact for each of the individual countries included in our panel. The
reaction of the real exchange rate is quite persistent. The peak depreciation occurs only 10 quarters
after the innovation in government spending takes place.
The expansion in public spending results in a protracted albeit small deterioration in the trade
balance.
Summarizing, our empirical results deliver four regularities that serve as the basis for evaluating
the theory presented in the next section. Namely, in response to an increase in government spending output and consumption increase, the trade balance deteriorates, and the real exchange rate
depreciates. These empirical regularities are quite robust. They also emerge in country-by-country
estimations, under specifications including additional fiscal variables, such as taxes, and monetary
policy variables, such as the nominal interest rate (see Monacelli and Perotti, 2006), and under
alternative detrending schemes (see section 9 below).

A Two-Country Model of Pricing to Habits

The model economy consists of two countries, the home country and the foreign country. Each
country specializes in the production of a set of differentiated goods. We denote by a the set of goods
produced by the home country and by b the set of goods produced by the foreign country. All goods
are internationally traded. To emphasize the transmission mechanism invoked by deep habits, we
abstract from a number of important frictions that are common elements of the related literature,
such as sticky prices and wages, distribution costs, nontraded goods, rule-of-thumb consumers,
nonseparabilities of preferences across consumption and leisure, and incomplete international asset
markets.

3.1

Households

We describe the household’s problem in the domestic economy. The foreign counterpart is a mirror image. The domestic economy is populated by a large number of identical households with
preferences described by the utility function

t=0

The variable xct is a composite defined as
xct = χ(xca,t , xcb,t ),

(3)

where the aggregator function χ is assumed to be increasing and homogeneous of degree one in
both arguments. The variable xca,t is a habit-adjusted composite consumption good of varieties of
goods of type a. Following Ravn, Schmitt-Grohé, and Uribe (2006), we introduce deep habits by
assuming that habits form at the level of each individual variety of goods instead of at the level
of the aggregate consumption good. We assume that deep habits are external to the individual
household (i.e., we model catching up with the Joneses good by good). Formally, xca,t is given by

Here ci,a,t denotes consumption of variety i of goods belonging to the set a in period t. The
parameter θac ∈ [0, 1) measures the intensity of deep external habits for consumption goods of type
a. When θac is equal to zero, preferences for goods of type a display no deep habit formation.
The parameter η > 1 represents the intratemporal elasticity of substitution across varieties. The
variable sci,a,t denotes the stock of external habit in consumption of variety i of good a. This habit
stock is assumed to evolve according to the following law of motion:
sci,a,t = ρsci,a,t−1 + (1 − ρ)c̃i,a,t ,
where c̃i,a,t denotes the average per capita consumption of variety i of good a in the domestic
country; that is, c̃i,a,t is the integral of ci,a,t over all domestic households. The parameter 1−ρ ∈ (0, 1]
denotes the rate at which the stock of external habits decays over time.
Similarly, xcb,t is given by
xcb,t =

To characterize the household’s demands for varieties of type-a and type-b goods, we consider a
two-step problem. Suppose the household has determined its desired consumption of the aggregate
goods a and b, that is, xca,t and xcb,t . Then it is optimal for the household to distribute its purchases
of individual varieties to minimize costs, that is,

Note that the demand for each variety of good a, say, is decreasing in its relative price, Pi,a,t /Pa,t ,
increasing in the level of habit-adjusted consumption of the composite good of type a, xca,t , and
increasing in the stock of habit of the variety in question sci,a,t−1 .

In each period t ≥ 0, households have access to complete contingent claims markets. Let
rt,t+j denote the stochastic discount factor such that Et rt,t+j dt+j is the period-t price of a random
payment dt+j of the (numeraire good) in period t + j. In addition, households are assumed to be
entitled to the receipt of pure profits from the ownership of firms, Φt . Households pay lump-sum
taxes in the amount Tt . Then, the domestic representative household’s period-by-period budget

constraint can be written as
Pa,t xca,t + ωa,t + Pb,t xcb,t + ωb,t + Et rt,t+1 dt+1 + Tt = dt + Wt ht + Φt .

(5)

The variable Wt denotes the wage rate. In addition, households are assumed to be subject to a
borrowing constraint of the form limj→∞ Et rt,t+j dt+j ≥ 0, which prevents them from engaging in
Ponzi games. The representative household’s optimization problem consists in choosing processes
xca,t , xcb,t , ht , and dt+1 to maximize the lifetime utility function (2) subject to (3), (5), and the
no-Ponzi-game constraint, taking as given the processes for ωa,t , ωb,t , Wt , Tt , and Φt and initial
asset holdings d0 .
The first-order conditions of the household’s optimization problem are the constraints (3) and

The first equation states that the marginal rate of substitution between the composite goods a and
b must equal their relative price. The second equation implicitly defines the supply of labor. It
equates the real domestic product wage to the marginal rate of substitution between leisure and
consumption of composite good a. The last equation is a standard asset pricing relation equating
the price of contingent claims to the intertemporal marginal rate of substitution.

3.2

The Government

Like households, the government is assumed to form habits on consumption of individual varieties of goods. This assumption is important for understanding the transmission of government
purchases shocks in the context of our model. We motivate the deep-habit formulation in public
spending by assuming that private households value public goods in a way that is separable from
private consumption and leisure and that households derive external habits from consumption of
government-provided goods. By good-specific external habit formation in the consumption of public goods we mean situations in which the provision of public services in one community—such
as street lighting, traffic signals, yard-waste collection— creates the desire in other communities
to have access to the same type of service. Alternatively, one can assume that the government
forms procurement relationships that create a tendency for it to favor transactions with sellers that
supplied public goods in the past.
We treat government habits as external. Conceivably, government habits could be treated as

10

internal to the government even if they are external to their beneficiaries, namely households.
This alternative is, however, less tractable, and is therefore not pursued here. In the econometric
estimation of the model, presented later in the paper, we let the data tell how much habit formation
there is in public spending.
The government is assumed to aggregate individual varieties of domestic and foreign goods to
produce two intermediate composite goods denoted xga,t and xgb,t , using the same aggregator function
as the private sector:

The parameters θag , θbg ∈ [0, 1) measure the degree of habit formation in government consumption
of domestic and foreign goods, respectively. The variables sgi,a,t and sgi,b,t denote the government’s
stocks of habit in variety i of goods a and b, respectively, and are assumed to evolve over time as
sgi,a,t = ρsgi,a,t−1 + (1 − ρ)gi,a,t
and
sgi,b,t = ρsgi,b,t−1 + (1 − ρ)gi,b,t ,
where 1−ρ ∈ (0, 1] denotes the rate of depreciation of the stocks of habit. The government combines
the intermediate goods xga,t and xgb,t to produce a final, public good xgt according to the relationship
xgt = χ(xga,t , xgb,t ).

Note that the aggregator function χ is the same as the one used by private consumers.
As in the empirical SVAR model of section 2, let gt denote total real government spending expressed in units of domestic GDP (i.e., nominal government spending divided by the GDP deflator).
Then, letting Pty denote the GDP deflator, to be defined later, we have that

for the variable nxy

the behavior of the endogenous variables appearing in the above law of motion for gt is dictated
by the dynamics of the theoretical model. For this reason, the theoretical and empirical impulse
responses of gt to an innovation in 1t will in general not coincide. Government spending is assumed

Firms

Goods of type a are produced exclusively in the domestic country, and goods of type b are produced
exclusively abroad. Each individual variety of good of type a or b is assumed to be produced by
a monopolist. Each good i ∈ [0, 1] is manufactured using labor as the sole input with a linear
production technology. Specifically domestic output of variety i of type a, denoted yi,a,t , is produced
according to the relationship
yi,a,t = hi,a,t ,
where hi,a,t denotes labor input in producing variety i of good a.
The producer of variety i of good a faces demands from the private and public sectors in the
domestic and foreign countries. The private and public domestic demand functions are given by

Implicit in the above demand functions are the assumptions that firms can price discriminate
between the domestic and foreign markets but that they cannot price discriminate between the
government and consumers residing in the same country.
A number of important implications for the model’s predictions regarding deviations from the
law of one price, and hence movements in the real exchange rate, are evident from inspection
of the above demand functions. First, each demand function for an individual variety of goods
is of the form dt = p−η
t xt + θst−1 . That is, each demand function is the sum of a price-elastic
component, p−η
t xt , and a price inelastic component, θst−1 . The price elastic component has price
elasticity η and is proportional to measures of current aggregate demand, xt . The price inelastic
term is purely habitual in nature. It follows that the price elasticity of each demand function is a
weighted average of η and 0, with the weight on η given by the relative importance of the priceelastic, nonhabitual demand component in total demand. An increase in aggregate demand enlarges
the importance of the price elastic component of demand increasing the price elasticity. In other
words, the price elasticity of each demand function is procyclical. Second, the fact that the price
elasticity is procyclical opens the possibility for markups to move countercyclically in equilibrium.
Third, because the price elasticity of demand can in principle be different in the domestic and the
foreign markets, it follows that firms have an incentive to charge different markups domestically
and abroad. We refer to this incentive for price discrimination as ‘pricing to habits’ as it originates
from the presence of a habitual demand for individual varieties of goods. More importantly, pricing
to habits gives rise to deviations from the law of one price over the business cycle at the level of
individual goods traded across borders. Finally, because firms understand that the stock of habit
is a weighted average of all past sales, their profit-maximization problem is dynamic in nature.
Thus, customer-market and brand-switching cost considerations in the spirit of Phelps and Winter
(1970) and Froot and Klemperer (1989) will endogenously emerge in the pricing behavior of firms,
affecting the size and persistence of deviations from the law of one price and movements in the real
exchange rate.

Symmetric Equilibrium

We assume that given the type of good (a or b), the type of consumer (private or public), and
the location of the consumer (domestic market or foreign market), initial habit stocks are identical
across different varieties. Then, in a symmetric equilibrium, all firms producing varieties of good
a for the domestic market will charge the same price. That is, Pi,a,t = Pa,t for all i. Similarly, all
∗
∗
firms producing varieties of good a for the foreign market will charge the same price, or Pi,a,t
= Pa,t

for all i. The same symmetry applies to the foreign produced goods (type b), that is, Pi,b,t = Pb,t
∗
∗ for all i. It follows from these assumptions that equilibrium consumption will be
and Pi,b,t
= Pb,t

the same across varieties as well, that is, ci,a,t = ca,t , gi,a,t = ga,t , ci,b,t = cb,t , gi,b,t = gb,t , c∗i,a,t = c∗a,t ,
∗
∗ , c∗

We define two good-specific real exchange rates. One is the relative price of good a abroad in
terms of units of good a at home, which we denote by ea,t . The second is the relative price of good
14

b abroad in terms of units of good b in the home market, denoted eb,t . Formally, the real exchange
rates for goods a and b, respectively, are given by
∗
Pa,t
Pa,t

ea,t =

.

Because firms can price discriminate across domestic and foreign markets, good-specific real exchange rates need not be unity. When the real exchange rate for a particular good is different from
one, we say that the law of one price for that good is violated.
At a more aggregate level, the real exchange rate, denoted et , is defined as the relative price of
foreign consumption in terms of domestic consumption, or
et ≡

Pt∗
,
Pt

where Pt and Pt∗ denote, respectively, the domestic and foreign consumer price indices. In the model
economy under study, however, the presence of habit formation at a good-by-good level implies
that there is no natural concept of either an aggregate consumption price index or even aggregate
consumption. We therefore define the consumption price index as an expenditure weighted average
of the price of final goods:
Pt = γPa,t + (1 − γ)Pb,t ,
where γ is a fixed weight defined as
γ=

Pa (ca + ga )
,
Pa (ca + ga ) + Pb (cb + gb )

where variables without a time subscript represent the deterministic steady state value of their
time-subscripted counterparts. We adopt a fixed-weight price index to mimic a common practice
in developed countries, whereby consumer price indices take the Laspeyres form. We note that our
definition of the consumer price index takes an arithmetic mean of prices in the broad categories
a and b. Within each of these two categories, price indices are constructed as geometric means of
individual prices. This convention is in line with the construction of the consumer price index in
the United States where, since January 1999, a geometric mean formula has been used to average
prices within item categories, while an arithmetic mean formula has been used to average prices
across item categories. The consumer price index in the foreign country is defined in a similar
fashion:
∗
∗
Pt∗ = γ ∗ Pa,t
+ (1 − γ ∗ )Pb,t
,

with
γ∗ =

Pa∗ (c∗a + ga∗ )
.
Pa∗ (c∗a + ga∗ ) + Pb∗ (c∗b + gb∗ )
15

Denote by τt the domestic relative price of imported goods in terms of domestically produced
goods. That is,
τt ≡

Pb,t
.
Pa,t

One can then express the real exchange rate in terms of this relative price and the good-specific
real exchange rates:
et =

γ ∗ ea,t + (1 − γ ∗ )eb,t τt
.
γ + (1 − γ)τt

We define aggregate domestic consumption as ct = (Pa,t ca,t + Pb,t cb,t )/Pt , or
ct =

ca,t + τt cb,t

γ + (1 − γ)τt

c∗t =

γ ∗ ea,t + (1 − γ ∗ )eb,t τt

.

We define real GDP as follows. We pick steady-state prices as the base-year prices. Recalling
that in the steady state all varieties of goods of type a are sold at the same price domestically and
∗ = P for all i), normalizing the steady-state price of the domestic good at
abroad (i.e., Pi,a = Pi,a
a

unity (Pa = 1), and taking into account the linearity of the production technology, real GDP at
base-year prices, denoted yt , is given by
y t = ht .
Market clearing for domestically produced goods requires that
∗
yt = ca,t + ga,t + c∗a,t + ga,t
.

The GDP deflator Pty is defined as the ratio of nominal GDP to real GDP. Nominal GDP is
∗ (c∗ + g ∗ ). Then, the GDP deflator is given by P y = [P (c

The nominal trade balance is the difference between nominal exports, given by Pa,t

We close the model by assuming that financial markets are complete and that financial capital can flow freely across countries. This means that domestic and foreign households face the

How the Pricing-To-Habits Mechanism Works

We now discuss at an intuitive level the potential of the pricing-to-habits mechanism to predict
a depreciation of the real exchange rate and an expansion in private consumption in response to
an increase in domestic government spending. To simplify the exposition, in this subsection, we
consider the special case in which all stocks of habit depreciate completely after one period (ρ = 0)
and the degrees of habit formation in private and public consumption are the same domestically
and abroad (θac = θag θac∗ = θag∗ = θ). In this case, one can show that the equilibrium markup of
price over marginal cost charged on varieties of good a in the domestic market, which we denote
by µa,t ≡ Pa,t /Wt , must satisfy

µa,t = 1 −

1
+ θΩa,t
η (1 − θda,t−1 /da,t )

−1

,

where da,t ≡ ca,t + ga,t denotes aggregate domestic demand for good a and Ωa,t denotes the present
discounted value of a sale in the domestic market in period t + 1. Note that in the absence of deep
habits (θ = 0), the markup is constant and equal to 1/(1 − 1/η). The above expression shows that
under deep habits, the markup falls in response to expansions in domestic aggregate demand for
good a, that is, when da,t increases. We refer to this effect as the price elasticity effect of deep
habits. It originates from the fact that when demand increases, the relative importance of the
price-inelastic (or habitual) component of demand falls. In addition, the markup is decreasing in
the present discounted value of a future sale, Ωa,t . We refer to this effect as the intertemporal effect
of deep habits. This effect arises because when the present value of a future sale increases, it pays
for the firm to invest in market share today by lowering current markups.

Suppose now that domestic government expenditure increases. This shock increases domestic aggregate demand relative to foreign aggregate demand. By the price elasticity effect of deep habits,
firms will lower domestic markups relative to foreign markups. That is, good a will become relatively cheaper in the domestic country than in the foreign country. Similarly, the increase in
government spending leads to an increase in domestic demand for good b, inducing foreign firms
to lower domestic markups relative to foreign markups. That is the price of good b falls domestically relative to the rest of the world. The fact that all goods in the domestic economy (a and b)
become cheaper relative to the foreign economy implies that the real exchange rate of the country
experiencing the increase in government purchases depreciates.
The decline in markups brought about by the expansion in government spending, is key for the
deep-habit model to predict an increase in private consumption. To see this, note first that the
increase in government spending produces a negative wealth effect on households, which, all other
things equal, induces households to reduce consumption and increase labor effort. In turn, the
expansion in the labor supply schedule tends to depress real wages. This is the basic mechanism
at work in the standard neoclassical model. Under deep habits, however, the decline in markups
that takes place following the government spending shock acts as a positive productivity shock
that shifts the labor demand upward. This expansion in the demand for labor can be strong
enough to cause the real wage to increase. In turn, higher real wages produce a substitution effect
whereby households increase consumption and reduce the demand for leisure. This substitution
effect may be strong enough to offset the negative wealth effect on consumption. In this case,
private consumption increases in response to an expansion in government spending.

the model. The time unit is meant to be one quarter. The discount factor β is set at a value
consistent with an interest rate of 4 percent per year. The curvature of the period utility function,
σ, is set at 1, which implies that preferences are separable in leisure and consumption. The case of
separable preferences in consumption and leisure is of particular interest because it highlights the
fact that the pricing-to-habits mechanism does not depend on the assumption of nonseparabilities
between leisure and consumption to deliver empirically realistic dynamics for consumption and
the real exchange rate in response to public consumption shocks. We pick the parameter φ of
the utility function so that households devote about one fourth of their time to paid work in the
deterministic steady state. The parameter ω of the aggregator function of domestic and foreign
goods is set to 0.5. This value allows us to abstract from home-bias effects in the transmission of
government spending shocks. It implies a relatively high share of imports in GDP of 50 percent.
In our sample, the average share of imports in GDP is 22 percent, which would correspond to
a value of ω of 0.7. We discuss later in section 9 the robustness of our findings to increasing
the value of ω. We set the elasticity of substitution between home and foreign goods, ξ, equal
to 1.5, a value commonly used in business-cycle analysis. We set the elasticity of substitution
across habit-adjusted consumption of individual varieties, η, equal to 5. We assume that in the
nonstochastic steady state government consumption represents 20 percent of value added, which is
the mean value of the observed government share in our sample. The implied steady-state level of
government spending, g = g ∗ , is 0.0487. We calibrate the feedback rule for government spending
given in equation (11) using the econometric estimates obtained in section 2. Specifically, we assign

Estimation of the Deep-Habit Parameters

There exists no readily available evidence on the parameters defining the deep-habit mechanism.
For this reason, we proceed to estimate them. We simplify the parameter structure by assuming
that the degree of habit formation is common across types of goods and countries. That is, we
impose θac = θbc = θac∗ = θbc∗ = θ c and θag = θbg = θag∗ = θbg∗ = θ g . We place emphasis on not
constraining the parameters θ c and θ g to be equal to each other. In this way, we allow the data
to determine the degrees of private and public deep-habit formation separately. In addition, we
estimate the parameter ρ measuring the persistence in the stock of habits.
Our estimation procedure consists in assigning values for θ c , θ g , and ρ to minimize the distance between the estimated impulse response functions shown in figure 1 and the corresponding
theoretical impulse response functions implied by the deep-habit model. We approximate the theoretical impulse response functions up to first order using the log-linearization procedure described
in Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2004).6 We consider the first 9 quarters of the impulse response functions of 5 variables (government spending, output, consumption, the trade balance-to-GDP ratio,
and the real exchange rate) to a unit innovation in government spending. Specifically, let Θ ≡
[θ c θ g ρ]0 denote the 3×1 vector of parameters to be estimated, IRe the 44×1 vector of estimated
impulse response functions, and IRm (Θ) the corresponding vector of impulse responses implied by
the theoretical model, which is a function of the three parameters we seek to estimate. Then, the
estimate of Θ, denoted Θ̂, is given by
e
m
Θ̂ = argmin[IRe − IRm (Θ)]0 Σ−1
IRe [IR − IR (Θ)],

(12)

Θ

where ΣIRe is the 44×44 variance covariance matrix of IRe computed using the delta method. This
matrix penalizes those elements of the estimated impulse response functions associated with large
confidence intervals.7
An estimate of the variance-covariance matrix of Θ̂, denoted ΣΘ̂ , is given by

ΣΘ̂ = JIRm (Θ̂)0 Σ−1
J
,
e
IR
IR
where JIRm (Θ) ≡ ∂IRm (Θ)/∂Θ denotes the 44×3 Jacobian matrix of the theoretical impulse
response function with respect to the vector Θ.
The estimation results are shown in table 2. The estimated degree of deep habit formation in
private consumption is 0.52, which lies well within the range of values estimated on the basis of
models featuring superficial habit formation. The estimated degree of deep habit persistence in
public consumption is slightly higher than its private counterpart at 0.57. The estimated value of
ρ is 0.9876, which implies that the stock of habits depreciates rather slowly over time. This finding
is not uncommon in the related literature on superficial habits. For example, consumption-based
6

Specifically, we use the matlab program gx hx.m available on our websites.
The impulse response functions implied by the estimated theoretical model shown below are little changed when
we define the weighing matrix as the diagonal of ΣIRe rather than as ΣIRe itself.

models of stock returns typically require a high degree of persistence in the habit stock to fit the
data (Campbell and Cochrane, 1999). In section 9 we study the sensitivity of our results to lowering
the value of ρ. All parameters are estimated to be significantly different from zero. Of particular
interest is the fact that the data identifies a nonnegligible amount of deep-habit persistence in
public consumption.

Comparing Predicted and Observed Impulse Responses

Figure 2 plots with a crossed line the impulse responses to a one-percent increase in government
spending predicted by the deep-habit model. In addition, the figure reproduces from figure 1 the
estimated impulse responses (solid lines) and their associated two-standard-error bands (broken
lines). The deep-habit model predicts an expansion in output and private consumption, a deterioration in the trade balance, and a depreciation of the real exchange rate. The model does a
relatively good job at explaining the observed transmission of government spending shocks. All
predicted responses fall within the estimated error bands, except for the late transition dynamics
of the real exchange rate. As is well known, real exchange rate movements are highly persistent,
a fact that in our regressions is reflected in a peak response occuring only 10 quarters after the
innovation. Explaining such a high level of persistence in the real exchange rate is a challenge for
many macroeconomic models including ours.
An important prediction of the deep habit model is that markups move countercyclically in
equilibrium. An increase in domestic government spending induces a decline in markups in all
domestically sold goods, regardless of whether they are imported or domestically produced. At the
same time, in the foreign economy markups increase as a consequence of a contraction in foreign
aggregate demand brought about by the negative wealth effect associated with the increase in
domestic government spending (and transmitted via complete international asset markets). The
impulse responses of the domestic and foreign markups are shown in figure 3.8 In response to a
one-percent increase in domestic government spending, markups in domestic markets fall by 26
basis points on impact and markups in foreign markets rise by 7 basis points.
Firms selling in domestic markets find it optimal to reduce markups because the increase in
aggregate demand stemming from the local public sector renders the demand for individual goods
8
Because of our maintained assumption of no home bias (ω = 1/2), the impulse response functions of the domestic
markups on imported and domestically produced goods are identical. For the same reason, the impulse response
functions of foreign markups on goods produced in the domestic and the foreign countries are also identical.

more price elastic. Recall that in the deep habit model, the price elasticity is an increasing function
of the importance of current demand relative to habitual demand. The increase in government
spending increases the importance of current demand causing a rise in the price elasticity and
a corresponding decline in markups. At the same time, the decline in aggregate demand in the
foreign country causes a decline in the price elasticity of demand across all markets inducing sellers
to increase their margins.
The generalized fall in markups that takes place in the domestic economy following a positive
innovation in government spending acts much like a positive technology shock, shifting the demand
for labor out and to the right. This increase in the demand for labor tends to push real wages
upward. Figure 4 shows that the real wage increases by 0.26 percent in response to a one-percent
government spending shock. This prediction of the deep-habit model is consistent with SVAR
evidence employing the Blanchard and Perotti (2002) identification assumption. See, for example,
Perotti (2007) for evidence from the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada, three of the
four countries included in our panel.
A natural question is whether in the data markups of prices over marginal cost indeed fall in
response to a positive innovation in government spending, as required for our theoretical model
to capture the observed increase in consumption and real depreciation of the exchange rate. To
our knowledge, there is no available SVAR evidence documenting the response of markups to
government spending shocks. We note that, being an unobservable variable, the markup must be

backed out from observable time series. This identification procedure requires inevitably the use of
theory. In our model, the domestic markup equals the inverse of the domestic real product wage.
Therefore, the fact that in the data real product wages increase in response to a positive innovation
in government spending (as documented by Perotti, 2007 and others), is consistent with markups
falling.
The implied countercyclicality of markups is crucial in allowing the deep-habit model to capture
the observed expansion in private consumption and the observed initial depreciation of the real
exchange rate. In effect, the combination of lower domestic markups and higher foreign markups
makes the domestic economy cheaper relative to the foreign economy. That is, the domestic real
exchange rate depreciates. In fact, the real depreciation of about one third of one percent on impact
predicted by the model is equal to the sum of the decline in markups in domestic markets (26 basis
points) and the increase in markups in foreign markets (7 basis points).
As discussed in the introduction, accounting for the observed depreciation of the domestic real
exchange rate in response to a positive innovation in government spending poses a major challenge
for the neoclassical growth model. Figure 5 substantiates this claim. It displays the response of
the real exchange rate under deep and superficial habits. In the economy with superficial habits,
habits form at the level of each composite good (domestic and imported), as opposed to at the level
of each individual variety. The figure shows that the deep habit model captures well the observed
initial real exchange rate depreciation. By contrast, the superficial habits model counterfactually
predicts that the real exchange rate is completely unaffected by the government spending shock.
The same mute response in the real exchange rate would obtain under the assumption of no habits
at all.

To understand why the real exchange rate is unresponsive in the absence of deep habits, note
that in the economy with superficial or no habits, the monopolists producing individual varieties
of goods face a static demand function with a constant price elasticity. Therefore, equilibrium
markups are constant over time and across countries. Furthermore, because the marginal costs
of producing a given variety is independent of destination market, the monopolistic producer will
charge the same price in the domestic and the foreign markets. Thus, in the absence of deep

assumption of no home bias (ω = 0.5), the domestic and foreign consumer price indices are identical,
or, equivalently, the real exchange rate is constant over time. We note that if in the economies with
superficial or no habits one were to allow for home bias, by setting ω > 0.5, then an increase in
government purchases would increase the price of good a relative to good b causing a counterfactual
appreciation of the real exchange rate.
A second major difficulty of the neoclassical growth model is its inability to explain the observed
expansion in private consumption following an increase in public spending. Figure 6 illustrates this
problem by depicting the impulse response function of consumption to an innovation in government spending in the economy with superficial habits. The counterfactual predicted decline in
consumption is driven by a negative wealth effect brought about by the elevated absorption of
resources in the public sector.9 A central contribution of the deep-habit mechanism is to enable an
otherwise standard model to overcome this difficulty. In effect, figure 6 shows that the deep-habit
model predicts not only an expansion in consumption but also one that is similar in magnitude and
persistence to the one estimated using actual data. As in the model with superficial habits, in the
9

Government spending shocks also have contractionary effects on consumption in the case of no habits at all.

model with deep habits an increase in government spending creates a negative wealth effect, which
tends to depress private consumption spending. However, the deep-habit mechanism generates, at
the same time, an increase in wages, driven by a generalized decline in markups, which induces
households to substitute away from leisure and into consumption. This substitution effect more
than offsets the negative wealth effect, resulting in an equilibrium increase in consumption.

Anticipated Government Spending Shocks

Thus far, we have focused on understanding the effects of government spending shocks identified
using a structural VAR approach. The SVAR identification strategy assumes that government
spending is unaffected contemporaneously by innovations to other variables. An important branch
of the related empirical literature follows a narrative approach to identify innovations in government
spending. The narrative approach consists in finding dates at which agents learn about upcoming
increases in public spending. Ramey and Shapiro (1998) identify three such episodes associated
with military buildups in the United States during the postwar era. Namely, 1950:Q3, 1965:Q1, and
1980:Q1, marking, respectively, news about the military buildups associated with the Korean war,
the Vietnam war, and the Carter-Reagan defense program. More recently, other authors, including
Eichenbaum and Fisher (2004), Ramey (2006), and Perotti (2007), have added 2001:Q4 to the
list of dates on which news about expansionary defense spending arrived, reflecting the expected
military response to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.
The aforementioned empirical literature has established that when identified using the narrative
approach, an innovation in government spending fails to cause increases in private consumption and

26

wages. This finding is at odds with the evidence derived from the SVAR approach. The disparities
between the narrative and SVAR approaches to identifying government spending shocks have been
interpreted in the related literature as suggesting that the narrative approach gives credence to the
neoclassical model, whereas the SVAR approach is consistent with models, like the one developed
in this paper, that depart from the neoclassical paradigm, chiefly by featuring a countercyclical
markup of prices over marginal costs.
We believe that the empirical evidence stemming from the SVAR and narrative approaches begs
a different interpretation than the one summarized in the previous paragraph. To see this, it is
important to note that the narrative and the SVAR approaches do not identify the same type of
government spending shocks. In particular, the narrative approach identifies anticipated government spending shocks, whereas the SVAR approach identifies unanticipated shocks to government
spending. In effect, Ramey and Shapiro (1998), Burnside, Eichenbaum, and Fisher (2004), and
Perotti (2007) show that actual government spending starts rising only two to three quarters after
the Ramey-Shapiro dates and reaches a peak six to eight quarters later, suggesting that these dates
indeed identify anticipated increases in government spending. By contrast, the Blanchard-Perotti
SVAR approach identifies innovations in government spending that are orthogonal to past information, and thus delivers a measure of unanticipated government spending shocks. It follows that,
regardless of what model best captures the underlying transmission mechanism of fiscal shocks, in
principle, the SVAR and narrative approaches should not be expected to deliver identical impulse
responses to government spending shocks, as long as in the true model agents react differently to
anticipated and unanticipated government spending shocks.
We illustrate this point by contrasting the impulse responses implied by the deep-habits model
to anticipated and unanticipated government spending shocks. Specifically, we consider a simple
process for government spending driven by unanticipated shocks as well as by shocks that are
anticipated two quarters in advance. Formally,

where 0t is an unanticipated innovation in gt and 2t is an anticipated innovation in gt+2 . Both
innovations, 0t and 2t , are assumed to be i.i.d., mutually uncorrelated and mean zero. Also, both
0t and 2t are in the information set of period t. The difference between 0t and 2t is that while
0t increases government spending in period t, the innovation 2t materializes into an increase in
government spending in period t + 2. The proposed process for government spending is deliberately
simple and meant only for illustrative purposes. Under this process, the peak response of government spending to an anticipated shock coincides with the first period in which actual government
spending increases, namely, the second period after the news. A more realistic process would feature a gradual increase in government spending that starts two periods after the news and peaks
eight to ten periods after the news.

the product wage rate, and the domestic markup to unit innovations in 0t and 2t . Both innovations
occur in period 0. The effects associated with the unanticipated shock are displayed with solid
lines. They are similar to those shown in figure 2, albeit not identical because they are generated
by a much simpler univariate process for government spending. In particular, the impact effect of
the unanticipated government spending shock is an expansion in consumption and a depreciation of
the real exchange rate. As explained before, the increase in domestic government spending causes a
decline in domestic markups relative to foreign markups. As a result, the domestic economy becomes
relatively cheaper than the foreign economy, or, equivalently, the real exchange rate depreciates.
At the same time, the decline in domestic markups raises domestic wages inducing a substitution
away from leisure and toward current consumption.
The impact response to an anticipated increase in government spending is quite different from
the one associated with an unanticipated expansion in public consumption. In figure 7, the impulse
response to a two-quarter anticipated government spending shock is depicted with broken lines. On
impact, private consumption contracts, product wages fall, and the real exchange rate appreciates.
The intuition for this prediction of the deep-habit model is as follows. In period zero, agents learn
that government spending will increase by one percent in period two. The arrival of this news
causes a negative wealth effect that dampens desired private spending. Ceteris paribus, the decline
in domestic aggregate demand should drive markups up by the price elasticity effect of deep habits.
At the same time, firms selling in the domestic market expect high demand and low per-unit profits
(markups) two periods later, when the increase in government spending materializes. Therefore, it
is optimal for them to disinvest in domestic market share in the current period by raising domestic
markups. In the foreign market, markups are expected to increase in the future, which induces
firms to lower current margins as a way to increase market share. The combination of higher
domestic markups and lower foreign markups results in an appreciated real exchange rate. Also,
the increase in domestic markups means that the real wage falls in the domestic economy.
We interpret the unanticipated innovation 0t to represent the government spending shock identified using the SVAR approach and the anticipated innovation 2t to represent the government
spending shock identified by the narrative approach. Our findings therefore establish that the deephabit model can reconcile the observed decline in consumption and wages on impact documented in
the empirical literature that follows the narrative approach to identification of government spending
shocks with the increase in consumption and wages obtained using the SVAR identification scheme.

Sensitivity Analysis

In our baseline model, we assume no home bias in consumption. That is, we assume that the
parameter ω in the aggregator function of domestic and foreign goods (equation (3)) takes the
value 0.5. As we indicated earlier, this value of ω implies an import share of 50 percent of GDP,
which is large relative to the average import share of 22 percent observed in our panel. When
ω is exactly 0.5, an increase in domestic aggregate demand does not lead to an increase in the

29

relative price of domestically produced goods. That is, the relative price of imported goods in
terms of domestically produced goods, Pb,t /Pa,t , is unchanged. It follows that movements in the
real exchange rate are entirely due to variations in the deviations from the law of one price, via the
deep-habit mechanism, and not due to variations in the relative price of imported goods.
We now set ω to 0.7, which implies a steady-state import share that is line with its empirical
counterpart in our panel. For this value of ω, agents in both countries have a bias toward goods
produced in their own country. In the presence of home bias, an increase in domestic government
spending causes an increase in the domestic price of domestically produced goods relative to the
domestic price of foreign-produced goods. That is Pa,t /Pb,t goes up. Because goods of type a have
a larger share in the domestic CPI index than in the foreign CPI index, the increase in the relative
price of domestically produced goods tends, all other things equal, to appreciate the real exchange
rate. The response of the real exchange rate to an increase in aggregate demand is then determined
by two (opposing) effects, the domestic-relative-price effect, which tends to appreciate the real
exchange rate and the pricing-to-habits effect, which tends to depreciate it. The upper panel of
figure 8 compares the response of the real exchange rate to a positive government spending shock in
economies with and without home bias. In the economy with home bias, all parameters other than
ω take the values shown in tables 1 and 2. Overall, the two theoretical impulse responses for the
real exchange rate are fairly similar. In line with the intuition developed above, when home bias is
present, the impulse response function of the real exchange rate lies below the one corresponding
to the baseline case without home bias.
The lower panel of the figure compares the impulse response of consumption in an economy with
and without home bias. The deep-habit model with home bias continues to predict a persistent
rise in consumption that tracks the actual response fairly well.
Our second robustness check concerns the persistence of the habit stocks. Our estimation of
the pricing-to-habits model yields a value of ρ of 0.9876, which induces highly persistent stocks of
habit in equilibrium. To gauge the sensitivity of our results to a less persistent stock of habits, we
now consider the case that ρ = 0.85. This value is more than four standard deviations below its
point estimate. All other parameters take the values shown in tables 1 and 2. Figure 8 displays
with diamonds the impulse responses of the real exchange rate and consumption for this value of
ρ. As one would expect, the impulse responses of the real exchange rate and consumption are less
persistent when the stock of habits itself is less persistent.
Our third sensitivity experiment focuses on the detrending method used to compute empirical
impulse responses to a government spending shock. In the baseline case all variables are detrended
using a quadratic trend. Here we replace this detrending method with the Hodrick-Prescott filter.
Figure 9 shows the empirical impulse response functions obtained after HP filtering the data.
Comparing this figure with figure 1, one can see that the empirical impulse responses obtained
from HP filtered data are quite similar to those obtained after removing a quadratic trend from
the raw data. In particular, a positive innovation in government spending causes an increase in
output and consumption, a depreciation of the real exchange rate, and a deterioration of the trade-

Figure 9 also depicts the impulse responses predicted by the theoretical model, where the structural parameters of the deep-habit mechanism were reestimated to match the impulse responses

Conclusion

In this paper, we use quarterly data from a panel of four industrialized countries from 1975 to 2005
to identify the effects of government spending shocks on output, consumption, the real exchange
rate, and the trade balance. We find that an increase in government spending produces an expansion
in output, an expansion in consumption, a deterioration of the trade balance, and a depreciation
of the real exchange rate.
A central contribution of our investigation is to propose and test the hypothesis that deep
habits generates a transmission mechanism for government purchases shocks that is consistent with
this empirical evidence. The key feature of the transmission channel invoked by deep habits is
countercyclical movements in equilibrium markups of prices over marginal costs. In our model, an
increase in government spending generates a generalized decline in markups in domestic markets
and an increase in markups in foreign markets. Thus, the domestic economy becomes inexpensive
relative to the foreign economy, or the real exchange rate depreciates. At the same time, the
decline in domestic markups shifts the demand for labor outward pushing real wages up. In turn,
the increase in labor remunerations induces households to sacrifice leisure in favor of consumption.
In the estimated deep-habit model, this substitution effect dominates the negative wealth effect
stemming from the increase in public absorption of resources. As a result private consumption
increases in equilibrium.
We estimate the structural parameters defining the deep-habit mechanism and find strong
evidence in favor of habit formation at a good-by-good level both in private and public consumption.
The predictions of the deep-habit model replicate well the estimated impulse responses of output,
consumption, the trade balance, and the real exchange rate. We interpret these results as a step
forward in understanding the effect of fiscal policy in the open economy.
Furthermore, we investigate the effect of anticipated increases in government spending from
the perspective of the deep habit model. We find that consumption and wages fail to increase
upon the release of news about future expansions in public spending. We interpret this result
as consistent with the empirical evidence emerging from the narrative approach to identifying
government spending shocks. In this way, we establish that the predictions of the deep-habit model
can reconcile the findings of the SVAR and narrative literatures on the consequences of government
spending shocks on consumption and wages.
10

The resulting point estimates of θc , θg , and ρ are, respectively, 0.56, 0.48, and 0.99.

33

We close by noting than in the present study we deliberately abstract from a number of theoretical features that are clearly important for understanding the international transmission of
aggregate shocks. In particular, we leave out nontradable goods, capital accumulation, distribution
costs, asset-market incompleteness, nominal rigidities, and nonseparabilities between consumption
and leisure. It would be of interest to investigate how these features interact with the deep-habit
mechanism in shaping the transmission of fiscal shocks.
