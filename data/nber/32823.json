    "abstract": "\n\nSecured lenders have recently demanded a new condition in distressed debt restructurings: competing secured lenders must lose priority. We model the implications of this \u201ccreditor-on-creditor violence\u201d trend. In our dynamic model, secured lenders enjoy higher priority in default. However, secured lenders take value-destroying actions to boost their own recovery: they sell assets inefficiently early. We show that this creates an ex-ante tradeoff between secured and unsecured debt that matches recent empirical evidence. Introducing the recent creditor-conflict trend in this model endogenously increases secured credit spreads. Importantly, it also increases ex-ante total surplus: restructurings endogenously introduce efficient state-contingent debt reduction.\n\n",
