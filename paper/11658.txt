ABSTRACT

This paper uses the Italian Social Security employer-employee panel to study the effects of the Italian
reform of 1990 on worker and job flows. We exploit the fact that this reform increased unjust
dismissal costs for firms below 15 employees, while leaving dismissal costs unchanged for bigger
firms, to set up a natural experiment research design. We find that the increase in dismissal costs
decreased accessions and separations for workers in small relative to big firms, especially in sectors
with higher employment volatility. Moreover, we find that the reform reduced firms' employment
adjustments on the internal margin as well as entry rates while increasing exit rates.

Introduction

Theory makes clear-cut predictions on the effects of employment protection on
labour reallocation (see, e.g., Bertola (1990) and Hopenhayn and Rogerson (1993)).
While a number of cross-country studies examine the impact of dismissal costs on
aggregate and sectoral employment adjustments, there are few empirical studies
on the impact of dismissal costs on worker and job flows using individual and firm
level data. Moreover, studies using micro-data often focus on the internal margin of adjustment, and often ignore adjustments on the external margin through
entry and exit.
In this paper, we use an Italian employer-employee panel to examine the effect
of dismissal costs on worker and job flows. Italy is an interesting country to study
this issue because it is one of the strictest countries in terms of employment protection legislation. More importantly, in 1990 Italy introduced a labour market
reform which increased employment protection for workers employed under permanent contracts in firms with less than 15 employees relative to those in firms
with more than 15 employees. We exploit the differential increase in the costs of
unfair dismissals in small relative to large firms after 1990 to study the impact
of dismissal costs on labour flows. We use a differences-in-differences approach
by comparing worker and job flows in small and large firms before and after the
reform.
Our empirical analysis uses administrative data from the Italian Social Security Institute (INPS). Our data set is an employer-employee panel, which includes
information on: dates of appointment and separation of the worker; dates of incorporation and termination of the firm, and the yearly average number of employees. We use these data to examine worker flows (i.e., accessions and separations),
and job flows on the internal and external margin (i.e., employment changes and
entry and exit). We find that accessions and separations decreased after the reform by about 10% for both men and women in small relative to large firms, and
the results are robust to the inclusion of sector and region effects, sector-specific
trends, sectoral productivity, and size-specific cyclical effects. Moreover, we find
evidence of a bigger effect of the reform in previously more volatile sectors.
Consistent with smaller worker flows after the reform, we also find employment changes fell by about 15% in small relative to big firms after the reform.
Moreover, we examine the impact of dismissal costs on firms’ external margins
of adjustment. In particular, we find that small firms are less likely to enter the
market after the reform compared to large firms. By contrast, small firms are
more likely to exit the market after the reform compared to large firms, which is
consistent with firms’ attempts to circumvent the legislation given that closing
firms are not responsible for unjust dismissal payments. Moreover, as for worker
flows, we find that these effects tend to be larger in more volatile sectors.
A number of previous studies have exploited the variation across firms in

2

employment protection legislation within Italy.1 Boeri and Jimeno (2003) assess
the effect of employment protection on lay-off probabilities by comparing small
and large firms, though they do not exploit the temporal change in the legislation. Borgarello, Garibaldi and Pacelli (2002), and Schivardi and Torrini (2004)
evaluate the effects of employment protection on the size distribution of Italian
firms, by looking at the probability of adjustments in size for firms around the
fifteen employee threshold. These three papers identify the effect of employment
protection by exploiting the fact that, in Italy, firms with less than 15 employees
are subject to lower dismissal costs than firms with more than 15 employees.This
amounts to capturing the effect of interest by comparing the performance of small
and large firms. Borgarello, Garibaldi and Pacelli (2002) also present some results
exploiting the temporal variation in employment protection, but their sole focus
is on the effect of employment protection on firm size and they do not control for
size-specific cyclical effects in their analysis.2
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the evolution
of dismissal costs in Italy. Section 3 explains the identification strategy used to
evaluate the impact of dismissal costs in Italy. Section 4 describes the Social
Security data and presents estimates of the effects of the rise in dismissal costs
on worker and job flows in Italy.

Employment Protection Regulations in Italy

Italy, together with the other Southern European countries, is considered one of
the strictest countries in terms of employment protection legislation (EPL). For
example, a study by Lazear (1990) for the period 1956-84 and a study by Bertola
(1990) for the late 1980s rank Italy as the strictest country in terms of EPL. A
study by the OECD’s Employment Outlook for the late 1980s, ranks Portugal
as the strictest country followed by Italy, Spain, and Greece. A similar study
by the OECD’s Employment Outlook for the late 1990s, which includes Turkey,
North America, and transition economies as well, continues to rank Portugal
as the strictest, followed by Turkey, Greece, Italy and Spain. The study by
Nicoletti et al. (2000), which does not include some of the countries in the
OECD’s Employment Outlook study, also ranks Italy third, after Portugal and
the Netherlands, in terms of the strictness of regulations on permanent contracts.
Dismissals were first regulated in Italy in 1966 through Law No. 604, which
established that, in case of unfair dismissal, employers had the choice to either
hire back workers or pay a dismissal cost, which depended on tenure and firm
1

Ichino and Riphahn (2004) exploits the within firm variation.
Other studies exploiting within-country variation to examine the effect of dismissal costs on
labour reallocation include: Kugler (1999); Hunt (2000); Oyer and Schaeffer (2000); Acemoglu
and Angrist (2001); Kugler, Jimeno and Hernanz (2003); Autor (2003); Autor, Donohue III
and Schwab (2004), Kugler and Saint-Paul (2004), Kugler and Pica (2004); and Friesen (2005).

size. Payments for unfair dismissals ranged between 5 and 8 months for workers
with less than two and a half years of tenure; between 5 and 12 months for those
between two and a half and 20 years of tenure; and between 5 and 14 months for
workers with more than 20 years of tenure in firms with more than 60 employees.3
Firms with less than 60 employees had to pay half the amount paid by firms with
more than 60 employees, and firms with less than 35 workers were completely
exempt.
In 1970, the Statuto dei Lavoratori (Law No. 300) established that all firms
with more than 15 employees had to hire back workers and pay their foregone
wages in case of unfair dismissals. Firms with less than 15 employees, however,
remained exempt.4 A number of recent studies show evidence of the binding effect
of this law for firms at the 15 employee threshold. For example, the last annual
report by the Italian Statistical Office, ISTAT, shows a larger fraction transiting
to a smaller size category for firms around the 15 employee threshold than for
firms at any other sizes. Similarly, Garibaldi, Pacelli and Borgarello (2003) and
Schivardi and Torrini (2004) find a (slightly) higher probability of inaction and
a higher probability of reducing firm size than of increasing it for firms at the 15
employee threshold.
Given the high costs of unfair dismissals for larger firms, in 1987 the Italian
government liberalized the use of temporary contracts in an attempt to provide
more flexibility to employers. Prior to 1987, temporary contracts could be used for
specific projects, seasonal work, or for replacement of temporarily absent permanent workers. After 1987, temporary contracts could be used more widely subject
to collective agreements specifying certain target groups. While the extended use
of temporary contracts allowed for more flexibility in the labour market, these
contracts could only be renewed up to two times and could only have a maximum length of 15 months. Consequently, even though temporary contracts were
liberalized after this reform, the use of temporary contracts remained heavily
regulated in Italy compared to other countries.5
Soon after the 1987 reform, Law No. 108 was introduced in 1990 further
restricting dismissals for permanent contracts. In particular, this law introduced
costs for unfair dismissals of between 2.5 and 6 months pay for unfair dismissals
in firms with less than 15 employees. By contrast, unfair dismissal costs in firms
with more than 15 employees remained as before. This meant that, after 1990, the
3

By contrast, payments for fair dismissals entail no cost to employers, as they are paid from
workers’ retained earnings.
4
Boeri and Jimeno (2003) present a theoretical explanation of why these exemptions may
be in place to begin with. They argue that exempting small firms reduces the disemployment
effect of dismissal costs because, in their model, smaller firms subject to dismissal costs have
to pay much higher efficiency wages to discourage shirking than larger firms.
5
Note that, according to the OECD’s Employment Outlook (1999), Italy ranked first in
terms of strictness of the regulation of fixed-term contracts during the 1980s and it continued
to rank first during the 1990s.

cost of unfair dismissals for firms with less than 15 employees increased relative
to the costs for firms with more than 15 employees.6 By contrast, in 1997, Italy
moved again in the direction of trying to provide firms with a margin of flexibility
by legalizing the use of temporary help agencies. While the 1990 reform increased
the costs of unfair dismissals for permanent contracts in firms with less than 15
employees relative to firms with more than 15 employees, the 1987 and 1997
reforms introduced flexibility at the margin by deregulating the use of temporary
contracts and temporary lay-offs. Since our data is for the period of 1986 to 1995,
in this paper we exploit the temporal change in dismissal costs generated by the
1990 reform for permanent workers, which applied differently for small and large
firms.7

Identification Strategy

The goal of this paper is to identify the impact of dismissal costs on worker
and job flows. In order to do so, we compare the change in the performance of
firms with less than 15 employees before and after the 1990 reform to the change
in the performance of firms with more than 15 employees. Since firm size may
be affected by the reform itself, we define small firms as having less than 15
employees in all years before the reform and large firms as having more than 15
employees in all years before the reform.8
The strategy to identify the impact of the change in dismissal costs is illustrated in Figures 1-4. Figures 1 and 2 show accession and separation probabilities
in firms with less than 15 employees and firms with more than 15 employees for
the period 1986 to 1995. Figure 1 shows a sharper decline in accession probabilities in small firms than in large firms, starting from 1991, i.e. right after the 1990
reform. Figure 2 shows a somewhat more pronounced decline in the separation
6

In 1991, the Italian government also introduced other reforms. First, the government
introduced fiscal incentives by reducing payroll taxes (i.e., social security contributions) for firms
with more than 15 employees. However, as shown in Kugler, Jimeno, and Hernanz (2003), while
an increase in dismissal costs should reduce both hiring and dismissals, a reduction in payroll
taxes should increase hiring but have no effect on dismissals. Also, in 1991, the government
introduced a special procedure legislation allowing for collective dismissals (i.e. dismissals of
more than 5 employees within a range of 110 days) in firms with more than 15 employees. We
include in our sample only firms below 35 employees, who are less likely to be hit by a shock
large enough to cause lay-offs of (more than) 5 employees. Finally, in 1992, the government
eliminated a wage indexation mechanism (Scala Mobile), which had been adopted in 1945, for
firms of all sizes.
7
Since we focus on permanent workers in our empirical analysis, we are unlikely to capture
the effect of the 1987 reform. Moreover, we also tried limiting the sample to the period from
1987 to 1995 to eliminate any possible effect of the liberalization of temporary contracts in 1987
and our results are the same.
8
We thus eliminate from the sample firms whose size crosses the 15 employee threshold
before the reform, so that we can focus on firms whose size is already at some “steady state”.

probabilities in small relative to big firms starting in 1989, which suggests firms
may have anticipated the reform. Figure 3 shows a greater decrease in entry for
small relative to large firms after 1990, while figure 4 shows a larger increase in
exit rates for small than large firms at least until 1993.

3.1

Worker Flows: Accessions and Separations

To control for the possibility that reduced accessions and separations are the
result of changing characteristics of workers and firms in different size categories,
we estimate the following linear probability model:



0
E mijt = 1 | Xijt , Sj , DjS , P ostt = β Xijt +δ0 P ostt +δ1 Sj +δ2 DjS +δ3 DjS × P ostt
(1)
where the dependent variable mijt is a dummy variable that takes the value of
1 if a match was created or destroyed, i.e., if there was either an accession or a
separation, between worker i and firm j at time t. The matrix Xijt includes: firm
characteristics, such as sector and region, and worker characteristics such as age,
occupation and gender. P ostt is a dummy that takes the value of 1 after 1990
and zero otherwise. Sj is the yearly average firm size, and DjS is a dummy that
takes the value of 1 if the worker is employed in a small firm and 0 if the worker
is employed in a large firm. The interaction term between the small firm dummy
and the post-reform dummy captures the effect of interest.
Comparing the periods before and after would control for the possibility that
changes in job reallocation in small relative to large firms after the post-reform
period were due to macro shocks, if small and large firms were affected similarly
by macro shocks. It is possible, however, that the business cycle affects small
and large firms differently. If this were the case, then we should have observed
both reduced accessions and increased separations during the post-reform period
due to the strong recession of 1992 and 1993. Instead, Figures 1 and 2 above
show both reduced accessions and separations. Nonetheless, to make sure we
control for differential cyclical effects on firms of different sizes, we also estimate
the following alternative specification:



0
E mijt = 1 | Xijt , Sj , DjS , P ostt , Et = β Xijt + φ0 Et + φ1 DjS × Et +
+δ0 P ostt + δ1 Sj + δ2 DjS +

+δ3 DjS × P ostt

(2)

where Et is an expansion variable which is either a dummy taking the value of
1 during the recession years of 1992 and 1993 or the growth rate of GDP. The
size-specific cyclical effect is captured away by the interaction term between the
small firm dummy DjS and the variable Et .
The introduction of dismissal costs should have a stronger effect on more
volatile sectors, where these costs are likely to bind. To check whether the rise in
6

dismissal costs after the reform had a greater effect in small firms in more volatile
sectors, we estimate the following linear probability model:


0
E mijt = 1 | Xijt , Sj , DjS , P ostt , Vk = β Xijt + δ0 P ostt + δ1 Sj + δ2 DjS +

+δ3 DjS × P ostt + γ0 VkS +


+γ1 VkS × DjS + γ2 VkS × P ostt

+γ3 VkS × DjS × P ostt
(3)
where Vk denotes the sectoral variance of employment growth during the prereform period. The coefficient γ3 captures the differential effect of dismissal costs
on sectors with different degrees of volatility.

3.2

Firms’ Employment Changes, Entry and Exit

To confirm that the reductions in accessions and separations were due to the
reform and not simply to the fact that workers are churning more during the 1990s
for reasons unrelated to the reforms, we examine whether changes in permanent
employment fell in small relative to large firms, even after controlling for firm
effects. In particular, we estimate the following linear probability model:


0
E |∆Ljt | | Zjt , Sj , DjS , P ostt = θ Zjt + ψj + ρ0 P ostt + ρ1 Sj + ρ2 DjS +

(4)
+ρ3 DjS × P ostt
where Zjt is a vector which includes sector and region effects, and sectoral productivity in some specifications. P ostt , Sj , DjS are, as before, the post-reform
dummy, the yearly average firm size and the small firm dummy. Finally, ψj is a
firm effect, where the regression is estimated with and without the firm effect.
While the above regression captures the effect of dismissal costs on the internal margin of adjustment, we are also interested on the effects on the external
margins. In particular, we estimate the effects of the 1990 reform on firms’ entry
and exit rates. We use the longitudinal information on firms to estimate the
following linear probability model:


E ejt = 1 | Wjt , Sj , DjS , P ostt = λWjt + ψj + π0 P ostt + π1 Sj + π2 DjS +

(5)
+π3 DjS × P ostt
where the dependent variable ejt is a dummy variable that takes the value of 1
if firm j enters or exits the market at time t. The vector Wjt includes sector and
region effects. P ostt , Sj , DjS are as described above. As for the regression of
employment changes, we estimate this linear probability model with and without
firm effects. Moreover, we extend the above specifications to control for sizespecific cyclical effects (as in equation (2)) and to allow for differential effects on
sectors with different volatility (as in equation (3)).

4.1

Effects of Dismissal Costs
Data Description

The data set is drawn from the Italian Social Security Administration (INPS)
archives for the years 1986-1995. The original data set collects social security
forms of a 1/90 random sample of employees every year, with workers born on
the 10th of March, June, September, and December of every year being sampled.
The original archives only include information on private sector firms in the
manufacturing and service sectors, so that it excludes all workers in the public
sector and agriculture. We use a 10% random sample from this original data set.
The data set includes individual longitudinal records generated using social
security numbers. However, since the INPS collects information on private sector
employees for the purpose of computing retirement benefits, employees are only
followed through their employment spells. The data does not follow individuals
who move into self-employment, the public sector, the agricultural sector, the
underground economy, unemployment, or retirement. The data set also includes
longitudinal records for firms employing the randomly selected workers in the
sample using the firms’ name, address, and social security and fiscal codes. While
the data set includes a random sample of workers, the probability that a firm is
selected increases with size. When using the panel of firms, we account for this
by weighting each observation by the probability that it appears in the sample,
which is given by the average number of employees divided by 90.
The data set is, thus, an employer-employee panel with information on workers
and firm characteristics. In particular, the data includes information on employees’ age, gender, occupation, dates of accession and separation with each firm,
and type of contract, and information on firms’ location, sector of employment,
number of employees, and firms’ dates of incorporation and termination. The
advantage of this administrative data for the purpose of studying the effects of
dismissal costs on worker transitions and firms’ entry and exit probabilities is
that, contrary to survey data which measures transitions by matching quarterly
data and using tenure information to identify job changes, in our data we can
identify the exact dates of accessions and separations according to when social security contributions began and ended. Moreover, the exact dates of incorporation
and termination of the employing firm are recorded in the INPS archives.
Tables 1 and 2 present descriptive statistics for men and women separately by
firm size, before and after the 1990 reform. Men’s accessions and separations decrease after 1990 in both small and large firms, but more in small firms. Similarly,
women’s accessions and separations fall more in small than in large firms, though
the effect on separations is stronger. These simple comparisons of means suggest
that the Italian 1990 reform appears to have reduced accessions and separations
of both men and women.
Table 3 presents descriptive statistics on firms’ characteristics. In particular,
8

this table shows that entry rates fell in small and large firms after the reform,
though the fall was more pronounced in small firms. On the other hand, exit rates
increased similarly both in small and large firms after the reform. Finally, the
volatility of employment (measured as the variance of employment) fell in small
firms, while it increased for large firms, after the reform. Though these simple
comparisons of means suggest that the increase in dismissal costs as a result of the
reform may have slowed down employment adjustments, some of these changes
could be due to changes in sectoral composition or location of small firms. The
following sections present results which control for covariates.

4.2

Effects on Accessions

Table 4 reports marginal effects of a linear probability model for accessions estimated using equations (1)-(3). The dependent variable is a variable that takes
the value of 1 if the person joined a firm in a given year and zero otherwise. These
linear probability models are estimated using a sample of permanent workers and
of firms with less than 35 employees. The sample is restricted to firms with
less than 35 employees to increase comparability between the treatment group of
firms with less than 15 employees and the control group of firms with more than
15-employees.9
Panels A and B in Table 4 report results for men and women, including
controls for worker’s age and occupation, firm’s sector and location, firm size and
year effects, as well as sector productivity, sector-specific trends and size-specific
cyclical effects. The reported standard errors allow for clustering by period-size
group to control for common random effects within these cells. Overall, the results
show a large and statistically significant decline in permanent accessions in small
relative to large firms after the 1990 reform was introduced. Column (1) shows
that accession probabilities decreased by 0.019 or 8.2% for men and by 0.02 or
9.2% for women in small relative to big firms during the reform years. Including
sector-specific trends and sector productivity in Columns (2) and (3) leaves the
effects on accession probabilities basically unchanged. Moreover, controlling for
size-specific cyclical effects in Columns (4) and (5) reduces the effect for men to
−0.01, while increasing the effect for women to −0.026.10
Columns (6) reports results which include the third-level interaction of the
post-reform dummy, the small firm dummy and the volatility of employment
9

Results are robust to changes in the 35 employees threshold.
In some specifications we tried including worker effects. The effects are similar but less
precise. This is not surprising given that we loose many workers from the sample because
workers are not followed once moving out of the labour force, or to the underground economy.
At the same time, given that accessions and separations are moving in the same direction, it
is unlikely that changes in workers’ unobservable characteristics after 1990 are behind these
patterns. For example, if less-employable individuals look for work in small firms during the
1990s, this could explain the decrease in accessions in small firms after 1990, but it could not
explain the decrease in separations.
10

9

growth, as described in equation (3).11 The results in this table show that the
probability of an accession falls drastically for workers employed in small firms
after the reform if they are employed in a highly volatile sector, where dismissal
costs are likely to bind. For example, accessions fall by 17% for men and by
38% for women in small relative to large firms in sectors where the variance of
employment is three standard deviations above the mean, but only by 6% for
men and 15% for women in sectors where the variance of employment is two
standard deviations above the mean. This confirms that workers employed in
firms where dismissal costs are likely to bind appear to be most affected the 1990
reform. This is reassuring since it confirms that we are probably capturing the
effect of the reform, rather than the effect of some other contemporaneous shock
or legislative change that should not be affect differently sectors with different
volatilities.

4.3

Effects on Separations

Table 5 reports marginal effects of linear probability models for separations. The
dependent variable is now a variable that takes the value of 1 if the person
separated from the firm in a given year and zero otherwise. The controls in these
specifications are as in the linear probability models for accessions.
As before, Panel A of Table 5 reports the results for men and Panel B for
women. The results show that separation probabilities decreased for both men
and women. For example, the results from the basic specification show a decrease
in separation probabilities of 0.029 or 9% for men and of 0.034 or 10.4% for
women. Controlling for sector-specific trends and sector productivity makes the
effects for men slightly larger, but does not affect the results for women. Results
controlling for size-specific cyclical effects suggest that the effect of the reform is
even larger. In particular, separation probabilities now fall by 9.6% for men and
by 14.4% for women.
Results of specifications including the third-level interaction between the postreform dummy, the small firm dummy and the pre-reform volatility of employment growth are reported in Column (6). We do not find a differential fall in
separations for men in highly volatile sectors. By contrast, the results for women
show that separations fall a lot more for women in small relative to large firms
in highly volatile sectors. For example, separations fall by 48% for women in
small relative to large firms in sectors where the employment variance is three
standard deviations above the mean, but only by 20% for women in sectors where
the employment variance is two standard deviations above the mean.12
11
Also in this case, we have ran different specifications (controlling for size-specific cyclical
effects, sectoral productivity and individuals effects) that we do not report for brevity, as the
results do not change.
12
Again, adding controls for size-specific cyclical effects, sectoral productivity and individuals
effects does not change the picture offered by column (6).

10

4.4

Effects on Employment Changes

We then analyse whether the increase in dismissal costs decreased employment
adjustments in the internal and external margins in small relative to large firms.
While the data set includes a random sample of workers, the probability that
a firm is selected increases with size. We account for this by weighting each
observation by the probability that the firm actually appears in the sample, which
is given by average number of employees divided by 90.13
To look at the effects of dismissal costs on the internal margin, we regress the
absolute value of firms’ employment growth on the interaction between the postreform dummy and the small firm dummy, controlling for a number of covariates
including firm fixed effects. Table 6 reports results of specifications controlling
for different covariates. All specifications show that the 1990 reform reduced
employment changes in small relative to large firms. The size of the reduction
seems large as the lowest estimates, which control for size-specific cyclical effects
and firm effects, implies a drop of 15% in the willingness to adjust employment.14

4.5

Effects on Entry and Exit

To look at the effects on the external margins, we estimate linear probability
models of entry and exit. Table 7 reports results from estimating equation (5).
The dependent variable is a dummy variable that takes the value of 1 if the firm
entered (Panel A) or exited (Panel B) the market. As for employment changes,
we weight each observation by the probability that the firm appears in the sample
and adjust standard errors to allow for clustering by period-size group.
Panel A shows that the entry rate of small firms goes down relative to large
firms after the 1990 reform. This result is robust to the inclusion of sector productivity, sector-specific trends, size-specific cyclical effects, and firm effects, and
the results range between a 10% and a 24% reduction. Moreover, the results in
Columns (7) and (8), which include a third level interaction with the variance
of employment, show that the reduction in entry rates is larger the greater the
employment volatility. For example, an increase in employment volatility of two
standard deviations decreases entry by as much as 30%, and an increase of three
standard deviations decreases entry by as much as 70%.
By contrast, Panel B shows that the exit rate of small firms increases relative
to large firms after the 1990 reform, where the results range between 18% and
50%. As for entry, the results are robust to the inclusion of sector trends, sector
13

As for accessions and separations, only firms with no more than 35 workers are included
and the effect of interest is captured by the interaction between the post-reform dummy and a
dummy for firms under 15 employees. Also in this case, the reported standard errors allow for
clustering by period-size group to control for common random effects within these cells.
14
The results do not change if the error term is assumed to follow auto-regressive processes
of order one or two.

productivity, size-specific cyclical effects, and firm effects. This is consistent with
the theory (see, e.g., Hopenhayn and Rogerson, 1993), as a rise in dismissal costs
lowers the present value of the future stream of profits, thus, leading to greater
exit. Moreover, given that closing firms are not subject to costs for unjust
dismissals, small firms subject to sufficiently large shocks may close up the firm
and re-open in order to by-pass the regulation. In addition, we find that the
effect is stronger for firms in more volatile sectors. Columns (7) and (8) show
that the increase in the exit rates is larger the larger the employment volatility,
though the effect becomes less precise when firm effects are included.

Conclusion

In this paper, we present new evidence on the impact of dismissal costs on worker
and job flows. We use an employer-employee panel from the Italian Social Security
to examine the effects of dismissal costs on workers’ accessions and separations,
and on firms’ employment changes as well as entry and exit. We exploit the
fact that dismissal costs increased in Italy after the 1990 reform for firms with
less than 15 employees relative to larger firms. This reform allows to adopt a
differences-in-differences approach that arguably helps to overcome identification
problems in some of the studies that use cross-country variation and cross-sectoral
variation in dismissal costs within a country.
We find that both accession and separation probabilities decreased for men
and women in small relative to large firms after the reforms. In particular, our
results imply a decrease of as much as 10% in accessions and separations. Moreover, we find that the effect is more pronounced in those sectors that were more
volatile before the reform, and where dismissal costs are likely to bind.
Aside from the effect of the reform on worker flows, we also find that the
reform affected employment adjustments on the internal and external margins.
On the internal margin, we find that the reform reduced employment adjustments
by as much as 15%. On the external margin, our lower bound estimates suggest
that the rise in dismissal costs reduced entry by about 10% while increasing exits
by about 18%. In addition, as for worker flows, we find that these effects appear
to be stronger in sectors whose pre-reform employment volatility was larger and
where dismissal costs are more likely to bind.
Overall, these results support the view that dismissal costs lower mobility by
reducing employment adjustments and flows into and out of employment. At
the same time, we have examined the impact of dismissal costs on the external
margin of adjustment, which has hardly been looked at in previous studies, and
find that while dismissal costs reduce entry, they also reduce firm survival.
