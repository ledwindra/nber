ABSTRACT
We study the adoption of Common Application membership by private four-year postsecondary institutions
and its role in explaining the growth in undergraduate applications. Using data from the College Board's
Annual Survey of Colleges, our estimation of proportional hazard models suggest that institutions
respond to the net benefit of adoption. We estimate that membership increases applications by 5.7
to 7.0 percent and decreases yield rates by 2.8 to 3.9 percent. Acceptance rates decrease for members
when their local networks are large. Membership is also associated with a decline in SAT scores and
an increase in the percentage of students of color. Finally, falsification tests indicate that membership
effects occur as a one-time adoption shock that persists thereafter.

1 Introduction
Between 1975 and 2005, the share of first year students that applied to four or more
institutions the previous year grew from 12.0 percent to 38.6 percent (Pryor, Hurtado, Saenz,
Santos, and Korn 2007). Our own estimates over the same period suggest that the mean number
of applications received by private four-year institutions increased from 1,282 to 3,129. One
potential explanation for the growth in undergraduate applications is that the college wage
premium has increased since the 1970s, particularly for graduates of highly selective institutions
(Murphy and Welch 1993; Brewer, Eide, and Ehrenberg, 1999). Increasing market returns to
postsecondary education may induce risk-averse prospective students to apply to more colleges
and universities.
An alternative explanation is that the market structure of postsecondary education has
transformed from a collection of local markets into a nationally competitive marketplace (Hoxby
1997).

This implies that colleges and universities have increasing incentives to increase

institutional prestige. Perhaps the most widely followed measure of prestige comes from the
U.S. News and World Report’s (USNWR) America’s Best Colleges which rewards higher mean
SAT scores, lower acceptance rates, and until recently, higher yield rates. Annual changes in
rankings have substantial consequences including the quality of students that enroll the following
year (Monks and Ehrenberg 1999). There is even some evidence that college and universities
manipulate admissions processes to boost USNWR rankings in otherwise counterproductive
ways (Avery, Glickman, Hoxby, and Metrick 2004).
Our focus in this paper is on an institutional choice that enhances USNWR prestige by
generating advantageous changes in undergraduate admissions outcomes. Each year since 1975,

1

the Common Application (CAPP) non-profit organization issues a standardized application form
that prospective students may submit to institutions that pay the membership fee. We present a
model where membership decreases the opportunity time cost of completing an application for
prospective students and increases the number of applications received by the institution.
Membership also exhibits network externalities because it reduces the application price at all
other member institutions causing membership effects to grow with network size.
To empirically test our model, we analyze the diffusion of CAPP adoption among
private, postsecondary institutions between 1975 and 2005 using the College Board’s Annual
Survey of Colleges.

Estimates from proportional hazards models stratified by Carnegie

classification suggest the presence of network externalities: the probability of adoption
conditional on being at risk increases with the membership share in the state, division, or region.
We also find that higher membership fees decrease the conditional probability of adoption which
is surprising given that they are small relative to annual institutional revenues.
We then directly estimate the effects of CAPP membership on a set of undergraduate
admissions outcomes. To our knowledge, our paper is the first to emphasize the effects of
application prices; the closest studies estimate the effects of list and net tuition on application
behavior (Savoca 1990; Curs and Singell 2002). OLS and two-stage least squares models show
that membership increases applications, admittances, and enrollment and decreases yield rates.
Interaction terms reveal differential impacts such as the presence of network externalities for
applications and acceptance rates. We also conduct a series of falsification tests that vary the
timing of adoption and show that membership effects occur as a one-time shock at adoption.
These dynamics and the presence of network externalities suggest that competition-driven CAPP
membership diffusion contributes to the growth in applications.

2

CAPP membership may also affect the characteristics of applicants, admitted prospective
students, and enrolled students.

In fact, the mission statement of the CAPP non-profit

organization includes a commitment to promote equity and access (The Common Application,
2007). Unfortunately, data restrictions force us to focus on the characteristics of enrolled
students rather than on applicants or admitted prospective students.

We find that CAPP

membership results in a small decrease in mean SAT scores and large increase the percent
students of color. Membership thus not only affects the number of people at each stage of the
admissions process but the characteristics of those that ultimately enroll as well.

2 Application Prices and the College Admissions Process
Recent studies of postsecondary education emphasize enrollment responses to the tuition
paid by prospective students (Leslie and Brinkman 1988; Dynarksi 2002; Van Der Klaauw 2002;
Avery and Hoxby 2004). Less attention is paid to the application stage, although there is some
evidence that the probability of applying to an institution decreases with list or expected net
tuition (Savoca 1990; Curs and Singell 2002). Our focus in this paper is on the effects of
application price changes on applications and admissions outcomes more broadly. Expanding
applicant pools is of increasing importance because to boost prestige, many institutions seek
lower acceptance rates and offer preferentially packaged financial aid to enroll the optimal set of
applicants.

2.1 Student and Institution Behavior with the CAPP
Our model of college admissions begins with the decision to submit applications by
prospective students and builds on Manski and Wise (1983). Students choose whether to apply
to an institution by comparing the utilities with and without enrollment at the institution. We

3

assume that the utility of enrollment increases with institutional prestige based on institutional
characteristics the previous year. This is consistent with prospective students assessing quality
based current USNWR rankings. This also assumes that prospective students do not anticipate
any effects of CAPP membership on institutional quality.
The utility of enrollment decreases with the application price which consists of the
opportunity time cost of completing an application form and the monetary fee assessed by the
receiving institution.1 Using the CAPP application form when it is accepted decreases the
opportunity time cost but has no effect on the monetary fee. The reduction in overall price
generates additional applications. This occurs both on the intensive margin, where existing
applicants increase the number of applications submitted, and on the extensive margin, where
new prospective students start applying for college because the overall cost is lower.
A salient feature of the membership is that it exhibits network externalities. Network
externalities exist when the benefit of a good changes with the number of other agents
consuming the same type of good (Liebowitz and Margolis 2004). In this context, the time cost
savings to a prospective student occurs at every institution that accepts the standardized form.
Membership effects are greater when the network size is large.
How do institutions respond to the increase in applications?

Colleges and universities

that accept the CAPP application form will receive additional applications from qualified
prospective students and prospective students who are likely to enroll if granted admission (such
as students applying to “reach” schools). Institutions that focus on selectivity and yield rates as
components of prestige increase admittances because there are newly desirable prospective
students in the applicant pool. This implies that CAPP membership will have an ambiguous

1

Recently, some institutions issue fee waivers for online applicants.
4

effect on acceptance rates (admittances / applications). Lastly, we assume that institutions have
constant enrollment targets in the short-run to generate sufficient tuition revenue but not exceed
capacity constraints.

Thus, membership unambiguously decreases yield rates (enrollment /

admittances).

2.2 The Diffusion of CAPP
Our model assumes that the membership benefits for colleges and universities are the
additional applications, and possibly lower acceptance rates, that are rewarded with USNWR
prestige.

The costs are the CAPP membership fees and the intended and unintended

consequences on student body characteristics. While we are able to measure some aspects of
student characteristics such as SAT scores, percent students of color, and percent low-income
students, we undoubtedly ignore others that may foster enthusiasm or resistance at some
institutions.2
We employ the diffusion of innovations model to analyze the institutional adoption of
CAPP membership. Firms adopt an innovation when the net benefits of doing so are positive.
For example, net benefits may increase with firm size when the profit of successful adoption
exhibits economies of scale (Davies 1979 as described by Baptista 1999). Larger firms may also
be better able to bear the risk of unsuccessful innovations.
In a representative reduced-form approach, Rose and Joskow (1990) show that larger
firms are indeed more likely to adopt coal-fired steam-electric generating technology in the
electric utility industry. Moreover, the probability of adoption conditional on being at risk
increases with the cost of pre-innovation technology. Adoption may also be more likely when
2

The University of Chicago recently debated CAPP membership where opponents claimed that
membership would change the character of the institution. This institution has called its
undergraduate application the Uncommon Application since 1998.
5

the net benefit of the innovation exhibits network externalities. For example, controlling for
other economies of scale, banks with more local branches have higher probabilities of ATM
(automatic teller machines) adoption conditional on being at risk (Saloner and Shepard 1995).
This approach may also include the strategic components of adoption.

The conditional

probability of ATM adoption by banks increases when competitors adopt the previous period, a
phenomenon Hannan and McDowell (1987) describe as rival precedence.
However, external validity may be a concern when studying the diffusion of industryspecific innovations: it is not obvious that the diffusion of coal-fired steam electric technology or
ATMs operate like innovations in postsecondary education. We are only aware of one study,
Getz, Siegfried, and Anderson (1997), that applies this approach to postsecondary education.
For thirty technologies including library, computing, and classroom innovations, the probability
of adoption conditional on being at risk depends on public or private control, financial resources,
and institution type (liberal arts, research, or university).

3 Data and Empirical Methods
The CAPP non-profit organization generously provided us with the complete adoption
history of all institutional members since its inception in 1975. Our sample, which includes
members and non-members, consists of four-year private colleges and universities in the College
Board’s Annual Survey of Colleges that meet minimal data requirements.3 We exclude public
institutions because they comprise only 4 percent of members in 2005 with the first adoption

3

The sample consists of institutions that report in 1974 and 2005, respond for at least 20 years,
and contain at least 10 years of data on applications. Our empirical findings are robust to 5-year
variations in the latter two requirements. We drop other-type Carnegie classification institutions
and those missing mean SAT scores throughout the panel. There is no College Board data in
1975, 1977, 1980, 1981, or 1983. We impute missing values for interior points with linear
interpolation and exterior points with the outermost non-missing value.
6

occurring in 2001. The final sample consists of 638 institutions in each year from 1975 to 2005,
of which 250 adopt in some year. Each observation consists of institutional data for first year
undergraduate students in year t where their applications and applications submitted by those
denied admission or did not enroll were actually submitted in year t–1.
[Figure 1. Applications by CAPP Status]
Figure 1 presents the mean number of applications per year for institutions with CAPP
membership in some year and those that never adopt. Institutions that never adopt experienced a
130 percent growth in average applications over the entire period from 836 applications in 1974
to 1,926 applications in 2005. In contrast, average applications at institutions with membership
experience grew 162 percent from 1,900 in 1974 to 4,996 in 2005.

While this suggests

differential trends in applications by membership, selection may be an issue because mean
applications for these groups were different before the CAPP non-profit organization was
created.
[Table 1. Sample Means in 1974]
CAPP and non-CAPP institutions vary by other characteristics as well. Table 1 presents
mean institutional characteristics in 1974, one year before the onset of risk; we reject the
hypotheses that the means for the two groups are equal for each admissions outcome and
institutional characteristic except percent Masters and the location dummy variables. CAPP
institutions have greater applications, admittances, and enrollment.

7

They also have lower

acceptance and yield rates and higher mean SAT scores.4 CAPP institutions are more likely to
be PhD institutions as designated by their Carnegie classification, where each institution is a
Doctoral (PhD), Masters (MA), or Bachelors (BA) institution. We also collect application fee
and list tuition data (in 2005 dollars) for 1985–2005 and find that CAPP institutions have greater
application fees and list tuition in 1985.5
We describe the empirical diffusion strategy next because the resulting estimates will
inform the subsequent program evaluation section of the paper. Our analysis of adoption centers
on the hazard rate h in Equation 1. The hazard rate of institution i in state s in period t is the
instantaneous probability of adopting CAPP membership conditional on not having adopted by
period t.

h(t | memberfeeist , pctcapp ist , X ist ) =

f (t | memberfeeist , pctcapp ist , X ist )
1 − F (t | memberfeeist , pctcapp ist , X ist )

The hazard rate depends on the CAPP membership fee.

(1)

The CAPP non-profit

organization set constant price schedules for 1980–1982, 1983–1992, 1993–1999, 2000–2001,
and 2002–2005. Institutions are sorted into groups based on the previous year’s total number of
applications, and all institutions within a group are charged the same price. For example, the
price schedule in 1993–1994 charged institutions with 0–999 applications $550, 1,000–1,499
applications $600, 1,500–1,999 applications $650, and 2,000–2,499 applications $700, 2,500–

4

Mean SAT scores are re-centered and calculated as the average of the 25th and 75th percentile
score at the institution. When missing, we convert ACT scores into re-centered SAT scores.
5
We impute missing tuition in the Annual Survey of Colleges with values from the Integrated
Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS). In cases where IPEDS reports tuition and fees
together, we subtract estimated fees based on within-institution averages of the fee to total cost
ratio over the entire period.
8

2,999 applications $750, and 3,000 or more applications $800.6

We convert the price of

membership into the fee per first year enrolled student in 2005 dollars (memberfeeist). The mean
price across all years is $3.36 per first year student.
The second variable of interest is our measure of network size, the CAPP membership
rate in the network (excluding institution i) in state s in period t (pctcappist). Ideally, we would
construct annual revealed-preference networks of the type described in Avery, Glickman, Hoxby,
and Metrick (2004), but such data were not available to us.

Instead, we define network

competitors as other private institutions the state, although we experiment with specifications
using Census divisions and regions instead. Lastly, the hazard rate depends on a vector of
institutional characteristics Xist which includes mean SAT score (satist), mean SAT score squared
(satsqist), percent on-campus students (pctcampusist), percent in-state students (pctinstateist),
religious affiliation (religionist), urban location (urbanist), and rural location (ruralist).
[Figure 2. Smoothed Hazard Estimates by Carnegie Classification]
We present two non-parametric estimates of the hazard rate in Figure 2 and Figure 3 to
guide our analysis. Each line is a kernel density estimator of the hazard rate for institutions
disaggregated by Carnegie classification or by SAT group with bandwidths that minimize mean
integrated squared error. The SAT groups are 0 to 33 (low), 34 to 66 (middle), and 67 to 100
(high) percentiles of the mean SAT score. To fix groups, we categorize institutions based on
their 1974 values.

6

Members that use the CAPP application form exclusively were charged $100 between 1980–
1982 and 1983–1992. More recently, institutions are charged an additional membership fee for
each online application submitted and a surcharge for online supplements. Prices for 1975 to
1979 are unavailable and are imputed with 1980 prices.
9

[Figure 3. Smoothed Hazard Estimates by SAT Group]
The hazard rates have three inflection points with local maxima just after the inception of
the CAPP non-profit organization and again in the mid-1990s.

Wilcoxon tests reject the

hypotheses that the hazard rates by Carnegie classification or by SAT group are equal. PhD and
most selective institutions consistently have the greatest conditional probabilities of adoption.
The shapes of the hazard rates, particularly those of MA and BA institutions that cross between
periods 12 and 13, do not conform to any of the well-known functions (i.e. exponential or
Weibull).

This suggests that a fully parametric specification of these forms would be

misspecified. Thus, we estimate semi-parametric Cox proportional hazards model stratified by
Carnegie classification as presented in Equation 2. Each Carnegie classification has its own
baseline hazard rate, but we assume that the coefficients of the explanatory variables are the
same across groups. Our discussion above leads us to expect that β1<0 and β2>0.
h(t | memberfeeist , pctcapp ist , X ist ) = h0j (t )exp(β1memberfeeist + β 2 pctcapp ist + X ist γ )
j ∈ {PhD, MA, BA}

(2)

The second part of our analysis estimates the effects of CAPP membership on a set of
undergraduate admissions outcomes: applications, admittances, enrollments, acceptance rates,
yield rates, mean SAT scores, percent students of color, and percent low-income students. We
calculate admissions outcomes for each first year cohort (combining full-time and part-time)
except for the percent low-income students which is not available. Instead, we use the percent of
all undergraduate students (both full-time and part-time) that receive Pell Grants as a measure of
percent low-income students.

(3)

We employ a standard program evaluation approach in Equation 3 where we regress log
admissions outcome k for institution i in state s in year t on a set of institutional characteristics.
Our primary focus is on the coefficient on membership status in year t–1 (cappist–1), θ 3k . In this
section, we include Carnegie classification dummy variables as an institutional characteristic
( σ ck ). We also include the log of list tuition (log_tuitionist–1) in t–1 because previous studies
show it to be associated with applications (Savoca 1990; Curs and Singell 2002), yield rates
(Avery and Hoxby 2004), and enrollment (Allen and Shen 1999). We do not correct for the
effects of grants, loans, or other financial aid on tuition in this paper. A novel feature of our
analysis is that we include the application fee (log_applyfeeist–1) in t–1 in 2005 dollars which to
our knowledge has yet to be used in the literature.7 Our prior is that θ1k <0 for applications.
Because application fees are unavailable in the early years of the panel, we restrict the evaluation
sample to 1985 to 2005.
The remaining independent variables are membership status and institutional
characteristics in t–1 with institution, state, and year fixed-effects. Institution fixed effects
control for unobserved time-constant characteristics such as the character of the student body, the
quality of athletic programs, and neighborhood amenities, and the state and year fixed effects
control for demographic and market structure changes.

We also restrict the sample to

institutions that report admissions data in both t and t–1 to match those used our falsification
tests described in the next section.

7

We also include a dummy variable for no application fee.
11

Because membership may be endogenous, we estimate two-stage least squares models
using the insights generated from our diffusion model estimates.

We approximate CAPP

membership status in t–1 with a linear probability model and use membership and membership
rate in the state in t–2 and t–3. With this approach, we assume that these characteristics have no
effect on admissions outcomes other than through their effects on membership in t–1.

4 Empirical Results
4.1 Diffusion of CAPP Adoption
We present our estimates for the baseline proportional hazards model in Table 2. We use
time-invariant independent variables (t=1974) to fix groups as they were before the CAPP
program. Only membership fee and network size are time-varying independent variables. The
left panel uses the full sample of institutions where the baseline hazard is allowed to vary by
Carnegie classification. The first column excludes institutional controls Xist and shows that the
conditional probability of adoption decreases by 25 percent for a one dollar increase in the
membership fee per enrolled student.8 We find suggestive evidence of network externalities
where a one percentage point increase in the membership rate in the state raises the hazard rate
by 2.2 percent. Because the average state in the sample has 13.6 private institutions, this implies
that an additional member in the network raises the hazard rate by 16.2 percent.
Column 2 adds the set of institutional controls. In general, institutions with higher SAT
scores are more likely to adopt CAPP membership conditional on being at risk with a peak at
1320 SAT points (95th percentile). Institutions with higher rates of on-campus residence are also
more likely to adopt, perhaps because they have greater financial costs of falling below

8

Marginal effects for relative probabilities are equal to exp(coefficient estimate).
12

enrollment targets. Institutions with a religious affiliation are less likely to adopt membership
because they are typically interested in a specific subset of potential applicants.
[Table 2. Proportional Hazards Model, Coefficient Estimates]
We disaggregate the sample by Carnegie classification and SAT group in the middle and
right panels respectively. This approach relaxes the assumption that the coefficients between
groups are equal. PhD institutions are the only group that does not respond to the price of
membership, although this may be due to small sample size. Nevertheless, these institutions
typically have the greatest financial resources at their disposal. The conditional probability of
adoption increases with network size only for MA and middle SAT institutions which suggests
that they are the ones that benefit most from the network externalities that accompany CAPP
membership.
We also estimate several variants of these models which are not formally presented here
but are available from the authors upon request. First, the construction of the membership fee
opens the possibility that the negative effects presented in Table 2 are due to the number of
applications rather than the cost of the innovation. When we control for institution size with log
applications or log enrollment, the negative effect of membership fee persists. Second, we
experiment with defining networks as competitors in the Census division or region because
prospective students are increasingly applying to colleges and universities outside their home
states (Hoxby 19997). We find evidence of network externalities at these broader geographic
levels that are similar to those using state-based networks.9 We also estimate models that use the
number of members in the network or whether a member in the network adopted the previous

9

See Appendix Table 1.
13

year but do not find any evidence that they predict adoption. We take this as evidence against
the rival precedence behavior found in previous empirical adoption studies (Hannan and
McDowell 1987).
Our results are also robust to using time-varying measures of all independent variables.
Because the non-parametric estimates in Figure 2 show that the hazard rates for MA and BA
institutions cross, we verify that the results are not an artifact of our missing data imputation
procedure that allocates Carnegie classification in 1988 to 1975–1987. Our results are robust to
artificially left-censoring the data in 1988.
The sample also includes 25 institutions that join and then drop CAPP membership. We
estimate a probit model for the probability of dropping membership for the set of institutions that
ever adopt.

Using the same set of independent variables described above, we find that

institutions with smaller networks that had become CAPP members are more likely to eventually
drop their membership.

4.2 Admissions Outcomes
We now turn to estimating the effects of CAPP membership on admissions outcomes.
We present the results from our OLS estimates in Table 3 where each column is a separate
regression for undergraduate admissions outcome k. Our main finding is that CAPP membership
in t–1 is associated with a 5.7 percent increase in applications (reported in t but occurring in t–1).
This is the first evidence that a reduction in the application price generates an increase in the
number of applications. We also find that CAPP membership is associated with a 5.2 percent
change in admittances and a 3.7 percent change in enrollment. When we estimate the effects on
the acceptance rate directly, we find no evidence of any membership effect.

In contrast,

membership is associated with a –2.8 percent change in yield rate. Our interpretation is that

14

institutional membership expands the applicant pool but draws in some applicants who are less
likely to enroll if admitted.
[Table 3. OLS Membership Effects on Log Admissions Outcomes]
We also control for log application fee and log tuition in t–1. An increase in the
monetary application fee reduces applications with an own-price elasticity of –0.062.

An

interesting result is that charging a higher application fee increases yield rates, and our
interpretation is that higher application fees limit the applicant pool to more “serious” applicants.
This result is consistent with the negative effect of membership on yield rates. List tuition is
weakly negatively associated with enrollment, although we do not emphasize the results here due
to usual omitted ability problems (Dynarski 2002). We also find that the yield rate decreases
with the listed tuition which is consistent with Parker and Summers (1993).
Institutional membership in CAPP may also generate changes in the characteristics of the
students that ultimately enroll at the institution. CAPP membership in t–1 is associated with a
1.1 percent decrease in mean SAT scores. We also find that membership is associated with a
15.4 percent change in the percent students of color and a 2.4 percent change in the percent Pell
Grant recipients. These results suggest that CAPP membership enables institutions to enroll a
more diverse study body by enrolling more students of color and those from low-income
households. This is consistent with previous evidence that low-income applicants benefit most
from increased information on the college application process (Avery and Kane 2004), but a
more rigorous test of this hypothesis should be conducted with applicant micro-level data.
[Table 4. OLS Membership Effects on Log Admissions Outcomes, Interaction Terms]

15

We test whether the effects of membership on admissions outcomes varies by two key
institutional characteristics in Table 4. The top panel presents estimates for OLS specifications
that include the interaction between CAPP membership in t–1 and network size in t–1. We find
evidence of network externalities in that a one percentage point increase in the network size is
associated with a 0.1 percent increase in applications for CAPP members. We find similar
evidence of network externalities in that the acceptance rate falls with the network size in the
state.
The bottom panel presents estimates that include the interaction between membership and
mean SAT score. Membership increases applications more at lower SAT institutions, perhaps
because applicants apply to more “safety” schools once the cost of doing so decreases. These are
also the institutions that may have trouble attracting students. Admittances increase more at
lower SAT member institutions which suggests that they expect the newly admitted students to
be less likely to matriculate or are further from their capacity constraints. Member institutions
with higher SAT scores experience a decrease in the acceptance rate which provides evidence
that it is the most selective institutions that benefit from membership in terms of USNWR
rankings. In addition, the yield rate declines less in absolute value at higher SAT score colleges
and universities. As expected, applicants that get into the most prestigious schools enroll there if
admitted. These results confirm the positive effects of network size and mean SAT score on the
hazard rate of adoption.
[Table 5. 2SLS Membership Effects on Log Admissions Outcomes]
The diffusion estimates presented in the previous subsection indicate that CAPP
membership is endogenous. To control for this endogeneity, Table 5 presents the IV estimates

16

using membership status and membership rate in the state t–2 and t–3 instruments for
membership in t–1. This procedure has little effect on the CAPP membership coefficients.
Membership increases applications by 6.0 percent, admittances by 5.7 percent, and enrollment by
3.5 percent. There is also –3.7 percent change in yield rates. Lastly, we continue to find that
membership decreases SAT scores and increases the percent students of color but that it no
longer has any effect on the percent of Pell Grant recipients.
[Table 6. First Difference Falsification Tests]
As a robustness check, we estimate a series of falsification tests based on the first
difference equation presented in Equation 4. Differencing current and one-year lagged CAPP
membership (t–1+l and t–2+l) implies that we are estimating the effect of adoption and not
membership on admissions outcome k. This approach will show whether membership effects are
consistent with the timing of adoption and whether the effects persist over time. A membership
effect associated with adoption that has not yet taken place would suggest that the program
evaluation estimates are misspecified.

in t–1 increases applications by 7.0 percent and admittances by 4.3 percent in t. There is no
effect on enrollment, but adoption last year decreases both acceptance rates and yield rates. The
lack of systematic significant effects for two or three year lagged adoption suggests that the
dynamics of membership effects are a one-time persistent jump at adoption. The non-significant

17

coefficients in the future suggest that there is no Ashenfelter-dip phenomenon taking place here
(Ashenfelter 1978).

5 Concluding Remarks
We find evidence that Common Application membership is a strategic decision by
private colleges and universities. CAPP membership increases applications by 5.7 to 7 percent
and admittances by 4.3 to 5.9 percent. We find evidence of network externalities in that the
effects on applications and acceptance rates change with our measure of network size. These
results are consistent with the diffusion estimates that show the net benefit as measured by these
characteristics increase the hazard rate of adoption. Our analysis of CAPP membership supports
the hypothesis that the postsecondary education market has structurally evolved into a more
competitive marketplace.
We also find that CAPP membership affects the composition of students that ultimately
enroll. In both OLS and two-stage least squares specifications, membership is associated with a
small decrease in SAT scores and a sizeable increase in the percent students of color. We also
find some evidence that membership is associated with a small increase in the percent of Pell
Grant recipients at the institution. These results suggest that the Common Application non-profit
organization has had some success in meeting its goals of increased access and equity.
There are at least two limitations to our analysis. First, we do not address the fact that
many institutional members require applicants to complete supplemental forms. These forms
provide institutions with idiosyncratic information unavailable in the standardized application
form. In fact, unpublished data from the College Board from 2000 to 2004 shows that over half
of all institutions that accept the CAPP application form require applicants to complete at least
one supplemental form.

A second limitation is that many institutions accept the CAPP

18

application form without actually paying the membership fee. However, the prevalence of this
activity is likely to decline over time because applicants are increasingly applying online – online
applications are submitted directly to the CAPP non-profit organization rather than the
institution. Both of these limitations suggest that our estimates are lower bounds on the true
effects of CAPP membership.

Notes: * p<.10, ** p<.05, *** p<.01. Standard errors in parentheses. Models 2, 4, and 6 include
percent in-state students, urban location, and rural location as additional independent variables.
Models 1–6 are stratified by Carnegie classification. Networks are at the state (columns 1 and 2),
division (columns 3 and 4), or region levels (columns 5 and 6). All independent variables except
membership fee and network size are fixed at 1974 values.
