    "abstract": "\n\nChanges in government spending often lead to significant shifts in demand across sectors.  This paper analyzes the effects of sector-specific changes in government spending in a two-sector dynamic general equilibrium model in which the reallocation of capital across sectors is costly.  The two-sector model leads to a richer array of possible responses of aggregate variables than the one-sector model.  The empirical part of the paper estimates the effects of military buildups on a variety of macroeconomic variables using a new measure of military shocks.  The behavior of macroeconomic aggregates is consistent with the predictions of a multi-sector neoclassical model.  In particular, consumption, real product wages and manufacturing productivity fall in response to exogenous military buildups in the post-World War II United States.\n\n",
