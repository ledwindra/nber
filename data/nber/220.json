    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper attempts to measure the effect of occupational licensing, restrictions on reciprocity, location specific investment in reputation and earnings on the interstate mobility of professionals. While 34 professional occupations are analyzed, special attention is focused on the legal profession. The comparatively low interstate mobility rate of lawyers may be due to state licensing and restrictions on reciprocity or to the investments made by lawyers to develop local reputations or to the investments made by lawyers in state specific law. Tests are conducted to distinguish among these three hypotheses.\n\n",
