Seigniorage, Inflation,
and Reputation

ABSTRACT

This paper derives a reputational equilibrium for inflation in a
model in which the government obtains valuable sei gniorage by
issuing fiat money in exchange for real resources.
One
insightful result is that, with contemporaneous perc eption of
actual government behavior and immediate adjustment of real cash
balances to new information, the Friedman elasticity solution for
maximal seigniorage is the reputational equilibrium. More
generally, the analysis shows that the objective of maximal
seigniorage produces an equilibrium inflation rate equal either
to a generalization of the Friedman elasticity solution or to the
rate at which the government discounts future seigniorage
adjusted for the growth rate, whichever is la rger.
Thus, the
model formalizes the conjecture that episodes of inflation rates
in excess of the Friedman solution are attribu table to high
discount rates for future seigniorage.
Adding aversion to high
expected inflation to the model, this analysis also rationalizes
the observation that- inflation rates are usual ly less than
Friedman's elasticity solution.

A useful positive theory of inflation not only must explain
why governments commonly expand the stock of fiat money at an
inflationary rate, but must account also for wide variations in
inflation over time and place.

The observation that governments

desire seigniorage, which they obtain by issuing fiat money in
exchange for real resources, directs attention to a potentially
important element in such a theory.

The importance of

seigniorage in public finance extends back to ancient times.
Fischer (1982) presents data for 120 countries that summarizes
the importance of seigniorage in recent years.

A convenient way

to begin to analyze seigniorage as a motivation for inflation is
to ask the following question:

If •a government wanted to

maximize the present value of its flow of seigniorage, at what
rate would it issue fiat money?

The essential analytical problem in answering this question
concerns the formulation of the government's choice set,
especially as it involves the determination of expected inflation
and the relation between expected inflation and actual money
issue.

An old strategy——see, for example, Friedman

(1942, 1971)——treats the expected inflation rate, Ep, as a policy

variable, and assumes that the government issues money at the
rate that validates its choice of Ep.

Using this framework,

Friedman obtains his elasticity formula.

Specifically, if the

elasticity of the stock demand for real cash balances with

respect to the expected inflation rate is —Ep/h, where h is a
positive parameter, a government seeking to maximize seigniorage
would set Ep equal to h—g, where g is the growth rate of cash

—2—
balance demand, and would issue money at the rate, h.

This

policy would produce an actual inflation rate, p, equal to h—g,
and, for the case of g equal to zero, would imply an elasticity
of demand equal to minus unity.

Estimates of the inflation rate that would correspond to the
Friedman elasticity solution for maximal—seigniorge differ
widely.

For example, for the case of g equal to zero, Friedman

(1971) suggests a range of 5% to 50% per annum, whereas Cagan
(1956) suggests a range of 11% to 44% per month and Barro (1972),

using an explicit inventory—theoretic analysis of money demand,
calculates an average value of about 150% per month.

In any

event, it seems clear that actual inflation rates are usually
less than the Friedman elasticity solution, but that in some
historical cases the actual inflation rate has exceeded the
Friedman answer.

An easy way to extend the Friedman framework to account for
inflation rates less than the Friedman elasticity solution is to
assume that most governments, for whatever reason, are averse to
high expected inflation rates and, hence, forego maximal
seigniorage.

Inflation rates in excess of the Friedman

elasticity solution are a bigger problem for this analysis.
Friedman (1971) suggests that such episodes reflect unusually
high discount rates for future seigniorage, which induce
governments to obtain more seigniorage now at the expense of less
seigniorage later by taking advantage of lags in the response of
real cash balances to accelerated money issue.

Friedman,

however, considers neither the possiblity that inflationary

—3
expectations would anticipate this potential government behavior
nor the associated implications of high discount rates for an
inflationary equil ibrium.

More recent analytical developments derive from related
reservations about the treatment of expectations in the Friedman
framework.

Calvo (1978) stresses that the Friedman elasticity

solution describes policies that are not time consistent and,
hence, would be relevant only if a government could bind itself
to fulfill its commitment regarding future inflation rates.
reality, such an irrevocable commitment is not feasible.

In

Indeed,

it would seem to contradict the concept of sovereignty.

Accordingly, it is wrong to treat inflationary expectations as a
policy variable.

Calvo formalizes this limitation on policy by assuming that
the government regards inflationary expectations as given and not

subject to its choice or influence.

Using this framework, Calvo

finds that a desire to maximize seigniorage woul d lead to money

alternative to Friedman's analys is clearly is not

—4
descriptively realistic.

Even in hyperinflationS governments

rarely issue money at the fastest physically possible rate.
Moreover, in the Calvo framework, aversion to high expected
inflation cannot explain low inflation because the government
takes inflationary expectations as given.

In response to this

problem, Barro (1983) assumes that governments are averse to
inflation, whether expected or not, and he derives a variation on
the Calvo result in which the inflation rate is less than p by an
amount that depends on the strength of this aversion relative to

the desire for seigniorage. s Barro recognizes, however, a
weakness in his theory is the lack of a convincing rationale for
strong aversion to unexpected inflation.

The present paper reconsiders the maximal seigniorage
question within a more general model of the determi nation of

expected inflation and the relation between expected inflation
and actual money issue.

In this model, inflationary expectations

are not a proximate policy variable as in the Friedman framework,
but are also not independent of the choice of money issue as in
the Calvo/Barro framework.

Instead, the model assumes that

policy actions and inflationary expectations are linked through
the government's reputation.

Given this linkage, the Calvo/Barro

outcome, although time consistent, would be myopic and,

consequently, would not be the actual result of a foresighted
government's desire to maximize the present value of its
seigniorage, even if the government cannot explicitly bind itself
to fulfill commitments.

The answer to the maximal—seigniorage

question instead takes the form of a reputational equilibrium in
which policy is both time consistent and foresighted.

In what follows, section I develops the basic analytical
framework.

Sections II and III replicate Friedman's analysis and

Calvo's analysis.

Section IV formulates the model of reputation

arid derives the reputational equilibrium.

Finally, section V

summarizes the main properties of this equilibrium and discusses
some extensions that would characterize a full positive theory of
inflation.

Analytical Framework

I.

The maximal—seigniorage question assumes that the
government's objective for period t is to maximize

(1)

S= E exp(_rti)s+t
i=O

where

St is the present value of current arid future seigniorage,

s. is the seigniorage obtained in period

t+i, r is the annual

rate at which the government discounts future seigniorage, and
t

is

the length of a period in units of years.

The government's

proximate control variable is current fiat money issue, and its
objective implies that it takes account of the effects of current
money issue on both current seigniorage and future seigniorage.
The analysis assumes that the fastest physically possible rate of
money issue, although finite, is very large.
As the analysis below shows, an important potential
explanation for differences in inflation rates is that different
governments have different discount rates.

A dramatic example is

that a government fighting a major war, especially one that

—6
threatened its survival, would be likely to have a relatively
high discount rate.

For simplicity, the present analysis treats

the discount rate as constant over time, although the same

results would also apply if the discount rate followed a random
walk.

In general, correctly allowing for the possibility of

changes in the discount rate over time would present a more
ambitious modelling problem than does the present comparison of
the implications of different constant discount rates.

(For more

on this issue, see Grossman (1984)).

Assuming that fiat money is produced at zero cost,
seigniorage in period t is the purchasing power of the
government's current fiat money issue.

Current seigniorage is

expressable equivalently as an increasing funct ion of the current
inflation rate and current real cash balances.

on its perception of government behavior formed in period t-l,
and g is an annual growth rate that captures the effects of all
other factors, e.g. population and income growth and developments
in financial technology, that influence the demand for real cash
balances.

The analysis treats g and the parameter h as fixed and

focuses on inflationary expectations as the link between policy,
i.e. the inflation rate, and real cash balances.

(Nichols (1974)

analyses the use of financial regulations to influence parameters
like g and h.)

This formulation of demand reflects the observation that the
holders of real cash balances are atomistic agents who cannot
individually influence the government behavior that produces
inflation.

Consequently, the demand for real cash balances does

not incorporate any strategic elements, and the government plays
what is analogous to a game against nature.

The assumption that the expectation relevant for current
demand is based on a perception formed last period provides a
simple way to model a lag in either the perception of actual

Calvo's Analysis

In reality, governments do not, and by their nature probably
cannot, irrevocably commit themselves to specific inflation
rates, or to any other policy rules.

Indeed, the power to

abrogate commitments without having to answer to a higher
authority seems to be an essential property of sovereignty.

Consequently, the Friedman strategy of treating inflationary
expectations as a choice variable does not seem to provide a
relevant analysis of seigniorage.

In developing an alternative to Friedman's strategy, Calvo
supposes that,

in addition to being incapable of credible

commitments, the government ignores any effect that its current
actions have on expectations of its future actions.

In this

case, given the fixed nonstochastic structure of the model, the

Calvo's analysis shows that the result of taking

inflationary expectations as give.n is "suboptimal" in the sense

that any inflation rate less than

p (but greater than —g) would

yield more seigniorage, if the government could convince the
public to expect that inflation rate.

The Friedman answer p',

is

an example of such an inflation rate.

IV.

Reputattonal Equilibrium
As discussed above, both theoretical considerations as well

as the facts of inflationary experience suggest that the Friedman
analysis and the Calvo analysis are each missing essential
elements of the correct answer to the maxtmal—seigniorage
question.

To capture these elements, suppose that, although the

government cannot directly control inflationary expectations by
committing itself to future inflation rates, its current actions
nevertheless influence expectations about its future actions.
The linkage between current actions and expectations is the
government's reputation.

Given this linkage, a foresighted

government would consider how its current actions affect its
reputation and how its reputation affects its future ability to
obtain seigniorage.

Only a government that ignored its

reputation wOuld behave as in the Calvo analysis, but such
behavior would be myopic.

To model the determination of the government's reputation,
assume that the public presumes that the government's behavior
will always be foresighted as long as the government has never

— 12

acted myopically in the past.

If, however, the government ever

acts myopically, then the public withdraws this presumption and
expects myopic behavior in the future.

These assumptions imply

is the inflation

rate that a foresighted seigniorage maximizing government would
choose.

Given the fixed nonstochastic structure of the model,

*

p

is independent of t.

The essential properties of this model of reputation are
that private agents are backward looking in determining the
expected mode of government behavior, foresighted or myopic, but
are forward looking in determining the expected inflation rate.
The potential loss of reputation for being foresighted creates
the distinction between foresighted and myopic behavior and,

also, by penalizing myopic behavior with a sharp reduction in the
demand for real cash balances, provides an incentive for
foresighted behavior.

This potential penalty emerges

automatically from the actions of individual, atomistic holders
of cash balances, who form inflationary expectations according to

— 13

equation (7).

The potential penalty does not require a willful

enforcement decision by members of the public.

This property

reflects the observation that the government plays what is
analogous to a game against nature.

(A possible extension in

this model of reputation might include assumptions about actions
that a government could take in order to regain a lost
reputation.)

Summary and Extensions
An expected inflation rate in the set of poten tial reputational

equilibria has the property that the present value of seigniorage is
at least as large if the government validates this expectation as it
would be if the government were to attempt to prod uce a temporarily

— 18

large flow of seigniorage by making the inflation rate higher than the
public expects.

A foresighted seigniorage—Inaximizing government

choses from this set the inflation rate that produces the highest
present value of seigniorage.

This inflation rate is the reputational

equilibrium.

The above analysis derives the reputational equilibrium based on
a model of reputation in which the public presumes that government
behavior will be foresighted as long as the government has never
behaved myopically.

If, however, the government were ever to behave

myopically, the public expects myopic behavior in the future.

This

expectation would eliminate or reduce possibilities for future
seigniorage.

Given the model of reputation, the analysis derives two
sufficient conditions under whi ch the reputattonal equilibrium is the
inflation rate that generalizes the Friedman elasticity solution to
the maximal—seigniorage problem.

One sufficient condition is that the

public perceives actual governme nt behavior contemporaneously and
adjusts real cash balances immed tately to new information.

The other

sufficient condition is that the government's discount rate does not

exceed the growth rate of money demand by more than this inflation
rate plus the growth rate.

The se conditions imply that, either if the

effect of the potential loss of reputat ion is immediate or if the

discount rate is low enough rela tive to other parameters

the

government's concern for its reputation produces results that are
isomorphic to Friedman's impi tcit presumption of irrevocable
comm itNents.

— 19

The analysis also shows that, given a lag in either perception or
adjustment, a sufficiently large discount rate causes the reputational

equilibrium for a seigniorage —maximizing government •to be an inflation
rate higher than the generali zed Friedman elasticity solution.
Specificiall y,

if the generalized Friedman elasticit y solution is not

in the set o f possible reputa tional equilibria, the reputat tonal

equilibrium is the inflation rate that, when added to the growth rate,

exactly equa is the difference between the discount rate arid
rate.

This

repu tat ional

the

g

rowth

inflation rate is the member of the set of potential

equilibria that is closest to the gene ralized Friedman

elasticity solution.
These results imply that different rates of in flation are

associated with differences in the slope and growth of demand for real
cash balances and with differences in the rate at which future

seign iorage is discoun ted.

One obvious extension of the analysis,

along lines suggested by Friedman, would assume that, for whatever

reaso n, the government is averse to a high expected inflation rate.

This extension would rationalize the observation that actual inflation
rates typically seem to be less than the reputational equilibrium
implied by the single objective of maximizing seigniorage.

Another worthwhile extensi on would incorporate into the analys is
reasons other than a desire for seigniorage that might tempt the
government to try to make the

the public debt as objectives of government policy.

Adding

these additional motivations for unexpected inflation to the above
analyses would have the same effect as a longer lag in the adjustment

of real cash balances or a larger discount rate for future seigniorge
in raising the inflation rate that is the reputatiorial equilibrium.

A more ambitious extension of the analysis would be to model
relevant parameters like the discount rate for future seigniorage as
stochastic processes.

This development would permit explicit analysis

of variations in the inflation rate over time.
