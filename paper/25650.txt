NBER Working Paper No. 25650

JEL No. D03
ABSTRACT
Simonsohn and Loewenstein (SL 2006) present evidence that a household moving from one US
city to another tends to pay a rent level that is closer to the city of origin, relative to comparable
locals. Building on “Memory, Attention, and Choice” (BGS 2019), we show that these effects
emerge from the interaction between memory and attention. In our model, memory is a database
of experiences such as rents. The current rent cues recall of past rents, giving rise to a rental
norm. A large discrepancy between the current rent and the memory-based norm surprises and
attracts the mover’s attention, distorting choice. Thus, when rents in Pittsburgh cue recall of rent
experiences in San Francisco, they look surprisingly cheap by comparison, leading the household
to spend more. We revisit the SL evidence in light of the model. Besides generating the basic SL
findings, our model yields two new predictions, which we test and confirm using 20 additional
years of data.

Simonsohn and Loewenstein (SL 2006) present evidence that, controlling for income and many
other individual characteristics, a household moving from one US city to another with lower rents,
say San Francisco to Pittsburgh, tends to rent a more expensive apartment relative to comparable
locals. The reverse is true for a person moving from a cheap to an expensive city, say from Atlanta
to New York. This effect is however temporary. Over time, movers converge to the choices of
comparable locals. This behavior is puzzling in light of standard theory, in which a mover’s
reservation rent in Pittsburgh does not depend on what he paid in San Francisco.
SL argue that a plausible explanations of their findings relies on Simonson and Tversky’s (1992)
background context effect, whereby a mover’s experience with high San Francisco rents leads him
to see Pittsburgh rents as cheap and so willing to rent an expensive apartment. But what is the
precise psychology of this effect?
In “Memory, Attention, and Choice” (BGS 2019), we show that these effects emerge from the
interaction between memory and attention. In our model, memory is a database of experiences
such as rents. The current rent cues recall of past rents, giving rise to a rental norm. A large
discrepancy between the current rent and the memory-based norm surprises and attracts the
mover’s attention, distorting choice. When rents in Pittsburgh cue recall of rents in San Francisco,
they look surprisingly cheap by comparison. The surprise attracts the mover’s attention, leading
him to spend more than he would otherwise. The model also explains why these effects are
temporary: with experience, Pittsburgh rents populate the mover’s database, and the rent norm
adapts.
BGS (2019) show that the interaction between memory and attention unifies many effects
studied in behavioral economics, ranging from experience effects, to projection bias, to inattention,
to reference effects. Here we revisit the SL evidence in light of that model. Besides generating the

basic SL findings, our model yields two new predictions, which we test and confirm using 20
additional years of data.

I. The Model
We consider the mover’s willingness to pay for a rental of quality 𝑞𝑞. This mover receives offers

drawn from the city’s rent distribution for 𝑞𝑞, and accepts rents below his willingness to pay. By
shaping the willingness to pay, the memory-based reference rent shapes the average rent paid by
the consumer for 𝑞𝑞.

The renter faces a choice set 𝐶𝐶 = {(𝑞𝑞, 𝑝𝑝), (0,0)} between renting apartment 𝑞𝑞 at rent 𝑝𝑝 and not

renting. Observing the current attributes (𝑞𝑞, 𝑝𝑝) cues recall of past renting experiences. Because 𝑞𝑞
is fixed, recall is only meaningful for rent.

A. Associative Memory
Suppose that the average rent in the destination city is 𝑝𝑝𝑑𝑑 , that in the origin city is 𝑝𝑝𝑜𝑜 . The

memory database is described by a distribution over these rents {𝑝𝑝𝑜𝑜 , 𝑝𝑝𝑑𝑑 } where 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 ∈ [0,1] is the
frequency with which 𝑝𝑝𝑑𝑑 has been experienced by time 𝑡𝑡. A higher 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 is either due to the fact that
the mover has stayed longer in the destination city or because he has lived in cities with similar
rents in the past.
Upon observing rent 𝑝𝑝 at time 𝑡𝑡, the mover recalls similar prices from the database. In this recall,

he overweighs rents similar to 𝑝𝑝, where similarity with a rent 𝑝𝑝′ is measured by the function

𝑆𝑆(|𝑝𝑝 − 𝑝𝑝′|), where 𝑆𝑆(. ) is decreasing in distance. Cued by the destination city rent 𝑝𝑝𝑑𝑑 , the memory
based rent norm is thus the similarity weighted average of past experienced rents (see Kahana
2012).
(1)

𝑝𝑝𝑛𝑛 = 𝑝𝑝𝑜𝑜 + 𝑤𝑤(𝑝𝑝𝑑𝑑 )(𝑝𝑝𝑑𝑑 − 𝑝𝑝𝑜𝑜 ),

where weight 𝑤𝑤(𝑝𝑝𝑑𝑑 ) ≡ 𝜋𝜋
with 𝑝𝑝𝑑𝑑 .

𝑆𝑆(0)𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡

𝑡𝑡 𝑆𝑆(0)+(1−𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 )𝑆𝑆(|𝑝𝑝𝑑𝑑 −𝑝𝑝0 |)

captures the similarity-distorted past experience

Equation (1) has three properties. First, a mover exposed to higher rents in the city of origin

has a higher norm 𝑝𝑝𝑛𝑛 , since a higher 𝑝𝑝𝑜𝑜 makes higher rents available for recall. Second, similarity

causes adaptation to the current rent. Formally, the weight 𝑤𝑤(𝑝𝑝𝑑𝑑 ) is distorted toward 𝑝𝑝𝑑𝑑 relative

to the experienced frequency 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 (when similarity is strong, 𝑆𝑆(0) → ∞, adaptation is full). Third,
experience with the destination city, or past experiences in similar cities (a higher 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 ), also causes

the norm to be closer to 𝑝𝑝𝑑𝑑 . Consulting Zillow increases 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 , but does not eliminate city of origin
rents from the database, especially right after the move when experience with 𝑝𝑝𝑜𝑜 is so recent.
B. Salience and Valuation
As the mover retrieves the norm 𝑝𝑝𝑛𝑛 , he values a rental 𝑝𝑝 according to the salience distorted

valuation:

(2) 𝑉𝑉 𝑛𝑛 (𝑞𝑞, 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 ) = 𝑞𝑞 − 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 − 𝜎𝜎(𝑝𝑝, 𝑝𝑝𝑛𝑛 )[𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 − 𝑝𝑝𝑛𝑛 ]

where 𝜎𝜎(𝑥𝑥, 𝑦𝑦) is a salience function that is symmetric, homogeneous of degree zero and increasing
in 𝑥𝑥/𝑦𝑦 for 𝑥𝑥 ≥ 𝑦𝑦. Salience here is modeled similarly to Bordalo, Gennaioli, and Shleifer (2013),

except it operates on the surprise relative to the norm. It captures the idea that the surprise (or
error in expectations) attracts attention, and is consequently overweighed in decisions.
Homogeneity of degree zero captures Weber-Fechner law of sensory perception: a given distance
between the current rent and the norm |𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 − 𝑝𝑝𝑛𝑛 | is more salient at lower price levels. A salient

difference between the current rent and the norm is overweighed in valuation. Thus a low rent

relative to the norm positively surprises the mover, attracts his attention, and boosts the valuation
of the rental, and the reverse for high rent. Willingness to pay is then defined as the rent 𝑝𝑝𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊 for
which 𝑉𝑉 𝑛𝑛 (𝑞𝑞, 𝑝𝑝𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊 ) = 0.
C. Predictions
Equations (1) and (2) yield several predictions about 𝑝𝑝𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊 (proofs available in Web Appendix).
Prediction 1 (Anchoring). WTP increases in 𝑝𝑝𝑜𝑜 , that is

𝜕𝜕𝑝𝑝𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊
𝜕𝜕𝑝𝑝𝑜𝑜

> 0. The rent paid on average

after moving to the destination city increases in the rent level in the city of origin.

Higher 𝑝𝑝𝑜𝑜 increases the price norm 𝑝𝑝𝑛𝑛 . By comparison, any given local rent seems relatively

more attractive, which increases the mover’s willingness to pay.

Prediction 2 (Adaptation from experience). If the household moves again in the destination city,
the rent paid subsequently depends less on the city of origin: 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 �

𝜕𝜕𝑝𝑝𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊
𝜕𝜕𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡

� = 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠(𝑝𝑝𝑑𝑑 − 𝑝𝑝𝑜𝑜 ).

By the time he rents again, the mover has greater experience 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 with local rents. Thus, his norm

is more adapted to the local rent (for 𝑤𝑤(𝑝𝑝𝑑𝑑 ) = 1 the mover’s rental choice no longer depends on
𝑝𝑝𝑜𝑜 ).

Predictions 1 and 2 were both tested in SL (2006). The following two predictions are new.

Prediction 3 (Adaptation from similarity). Rent in city of origin has a smaller effect on rent paid
in the destination city for movers who had previously lived in cities with rents similar to 𝑝𝑝𝑑𝑑 .

In our setting, this is identical to Prediction 2 because we assume that living long ago in a city

with rent 𝑝𝑝𝑑𝑑 affects norms similarly to living in the destination city. This is akin to having greater

experience 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 with 𝑝𝑝𝑑𝑑 . Due to similarity, these rents are recalled even if experienced long in the

past, which increases adaptation to the current rent, reducing the influence of the rent in the city
of origin 𝑝𝑝𝑜𝑜 .

Prediction 4 (Asymmetry). Rent in city of origin has a stronger effect on rent paid for movers to

cheaper cities than for movers to more expensive cities, namely:
𝜕𝜕𝑝𝑝𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊
�
𝜕𝜕𝑝𝑝𝑜𝑜 𝑝𝑝

𝑜𝑜 >𝑝𝑝𝑑𝑑

>

𝜕𝜕𝑝𝑝𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊
�
𝜕𝜕𝑝𝑝𝑜𝑜 𝑝𝑝

𝑜𝑜<𝑝𝑝𝑑𝑑

Formally, the coefficient on city of origin rent should be higher for movers coming from more
expensive cities than for movers to more expensive cities. This last prediction highlights a
distinctive decoy effect property of salience: in expensive cities where 𝑝𝑝𝑑𝑑 is high, any given price

difference is less salient, reducing anchoring to past rents. Loss aversion would predict the opposite
effect.

II. Empirical Tests
We use data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), a longitudinal yearly survey on
a representative sample of U.S. families. PSID data on housing history is now available from 1983
to 2013, roughly tripling the SL sample (1983-1993). 1 We supplement this data with historical
data on median rents at the county level from the Fair Market Rents Dataset. 2 Like SL, we focus

The analysis uses the PSID’s Sensitive Data Files. We obtained access to this data under contractual arrangements designed to protect the
anonymity of respondents. PSID did not collect data on rent paid during the years 1988 and 1999, so these years are excluded from the analysis.
Following SL, we focus on households observed for at least five survey waves and who move cities at least once. Additional information on our
data analysis is available upon request. Table A.1 in the Appendix presents some summary statistics for our sample.

our analysis on Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs), and use the terms city and MSA
interchangeably. Median rents are aggregated to MSA level using population weights and all prices
are converted to 1999 dollars.
To test predictions 1 to 4 we follow closely SL’s approach. Consider a household 𝑖𝑖 that moves

in survey year 𝑡𝑡 and is a renter after the move. We take his post-move rent at year 𝑡𝑡, denoted 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ,
as a proxy for his unobserved 𝑝𝑝𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊 . We then run regressions of the form:
(3) 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽𝛽𝑜𝑜 ∙ 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 𝑝𝑝𝑜𝑜,𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽𝑑𝑑 ∙ 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 𝑝𝑝𝑑𝑑,𝑡𝑡 + 𝜷𝜷𝑿𝑿 ∙ 𝑿𝑿𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡

Let 𝑝𝑝𝑜𝑜,𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖 and 𝑝𝑝𝑑𝑑,𝑡𝑡 denote the median rents in the mover’s cities of origin and destination,

respectively. While rent levels in the current city are measured in the year of the move, 𝑡𝑡, rent
levels in the city of origin are measured the last year the household lived there.

There are two related econometric concerns: rental quality must be held constant and we must
address heterogeneity of households. Like SL, we control for housing quality and household
heterogeneity by including in our regressions several controls available in the PSID: household
income, family composition, and age and education of head of household. We also control for
whether the household previously rented or owned, and for a measure of relative taste for housing,
the ratio 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖 /𝑝𝑝𝑜𝑜,𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖 of their rent expenditure to the median rent in the city of origin for past renters,
and the analogous ratio in terms of house prices for past owners. We also include year fixed effects
and a Heckman correction to account for endogenous sorting into renting, as opposed to buying.
We test prediction 1 using all observations of households in the year they move across cities. To
test prediction 2 we consider households whom we observe moving within a city after having
moved between cities. To test prediction 3 on adaptation through price-similarity, we focus on
movers for whom we observe two moves across three cities. We measure rent similarity between
the earlier city and destination city by the absolute difference in median rent |𝑝𝑝𝑑𝑑 − 𝑝𝑝𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒 |. We
then divide these movers into households for whom price similarity between destination and earlier
cities is higher or lower than the median in this sample, and run the regression separately for each
group. Finally, we test prediction 4 on asymmetry by dividing the baseline sample (used in
Prediction 1) into households who moved to more expensive versus cheaper cities.
Table 1 presents the results. The estimates show the expected positive relation between rent paid
and income, family size and local price levels. Intuitively, richer and larger households are likely
to rent larger places. The results support predictions 1 and 2, and quantitatively confirm the
findings of SL (2006) in our larger dataset. In the baseline case (column 1), the coefficient 𝛽𝛽𝑜𝑜 on

𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙(𝑝𝑝𝑜𝑜 ) is significantly positive and similar in magnitude to SL’s: two otherwise identical

individuals whose 𝑝𝑝0 differs by one standard deviation differ in their rental expenditures in the

same city by 3.4%. Prediction 2 also finds support: when households move again within the same
city (column 2), past city rents no longer matter. With the smaller sample size, we cannot conclude

that this coefficient is significantly different from the baseline case.

Standard errors in parentheses. * p<0.05, ** p<0.01, *** p<0.001.

To test prediction 3, we restrict the sample to households that move twice (columns 3 and 4).
As the model predicts, when movers have experienced past rent levels similar to current ones
(column 4), the influence of city of origin rent 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙(𝑝𝑝𝑜𝑜 ) on rental expenditure in the destination

city is insignificant. But when movers have not experienced similar rents in the past (column 3),

the effect of past rents is larger, and statistically significant. Again, given the small sample, the
coefficients are not significantly different from each other.

Finally, in line with prediction 4, the anchoring of rents paid to past rents is driven almost entirely
by households that move to cheaper cities, and rent more expensive housing than locals do
(columns 5 and 6). Past rents matter much less when households move to more expensive cities.
The 𝛽𝛽𝑜𝑜 coefficients are different across the two samples at the 5% significance level. 3

In sum, the evidence is consistent with the four predictions of the model. Memory-based

reference points provide a rationale for anchoring to recent rent levels, previously documented by
SL. Adaptation based on rent similarity is a more nuanced prediction, and the evidence is
statistically weaker but supportive as well. Finally, we find support for asymmetric referencedependent valuation. Our model thus generates novel predictions that we tested and confirmed
using heterogeneous consumer experiences.
III. Conclusion
The interaction between memory and attention yields reference effects that shed light on
observed housing choices of movers. The reference price, or norm, is not rational but is formed
using past experiences. Indeed, rational expectations reference points would counterfactually
imply immediate adaptation upon learning destination city level of rents. The memory based price
norm also differs from a mechanical “backward looking” one because it adjusts through similarity.
Because our reference point is situation-specific, adaptation is fast if similar experiences were had
even in remote past.
Salience and attention put additional discipline into the context-dependence created by memory,
because they describe through well known mechanisms of sensory perception how measurable
surprises affect choice. The current analysis is merely a proof of concept. BGS (2019) present a
more general model of memory and attention that accounts for a variety of puzzling aspects of
choice. The present paper does show, though, that models of choice combining psychologically
plausible formulations of memory and perception can help explain field data.

3

The results of Table 1 are robust to different specifications. Controlling for endogenous selection into renting or for taste for housing, or
excluding households who move for housing related reasons, plays essentially no role. Restricting the sample to households who rented before the
move has little effect, except for prediction 3: the results remain directionally consistent, but the effect on households who experienced dissimilar
prices is no longer significant, perhaps due to the much smaller sample size. SL test a version of Prediction 4 and find no asymmetry in their shorter
sample.
