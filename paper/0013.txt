WAGE COMPARISONS - A SELECTIVITY BIAS

The economics of information have

been established by now as an integral

part of economic analysis. The effect of the scarcity o information
on the dispersion of prices and wages, the quality of goods,
frictional unemployment and the microeconomics of inflation have been
widely discussed in the literature.1

been written on the implications of

However, surprisingly little has
search (and in particular, job

search) for the estimation of the wage function and its
ramifications in such cases as the estimation of the determinants of
labor force participation,

age-earning profiles, rates of return and

rates of depreciation of human

capita]., degree of discrimation, etc.2

Given a wage offer distribution,

the parameters of the observed

wage distribution depend on the intensity of search. The lower a
person's wage demands the greater the chance of his finding an
acceptable job, but the lower the wage he expects to receive and the
wider the dispersion of acceptable

wages around their mean. On the

other hand, the job seeker may opt for a more ambitious search
strategy, raising his minimum wage demand and
the risk of remaining

consequently increasing

unemployed, but also increasing the expected

-2wage and decreasing the dispersion of the acceptable offers.

Much of the discussion in labor economics concerning labor force
participation, wages, and earnings centers on the wage offer

distribution. However, the empirical validation of the theory is based
on the observed wage distribution. The implicit identification of wage
offers with observed wages is particularly suspect when those employed

constitute only a fraction of the total population. In this case, the
observed distribution represents only one part of the wage offer
distribution, the other part being rejected by the job seekers as

unacceptable. Thus, the traditional estimation procedures may involve
certain biases when applied to the secondary labor groups-- married
women, teenagers, and the aged.
This paper attempts to point out some of these biases and suggests

a method for their correction. In the next section we outline a
simplified search model. The implicationsof this model for the
investigation of labor force participation, discrimination, and the

rates of return and rates of depreciation of hunan capital are discussed

in the third section. In the fourth section I describe an estimation
procedure for the wage_offer distribution using a simplified set of

assumptions. The paper closes with a discussion of some results
obtained using the new method.

Correcting for what I call the selectivity bias I show that
traditional measures underestimate the rate of return to human capital
and its rate of depreciation when they are applied to married women.

These measures tend to overstate the white/non-white wage
differential, but to understate the wage offer differentials between

-3males and females and between women with and without young children.
The use of data on the

average wage of working women yields upward

biased estimates of the effect of wages on the labor force participation
of married women, as well

as overestimates (in absolute terms) of the

age and education effects.
The Search Model

Economic literature contains a large variety of search models. These

models vary in their description of the search behavior and their
assumptions about the job seeker's time horizon and his prior

knowledge of market conditions. Some authors assume that the job
seeker decides ahead of time on the number of searches he will

undertake while others adopt a

sequential search model. Some assume

that the wage-offer distribution

is well known, while others postulate

that the job seeker revises his assumptions about the distribution

as a consequence of the search. Some allow for an infinite time
horizon while others restrict the time horizon.
For simplicity let us assume that the job seeker is unemployed,
that he adopts a sequential search

strategy, that he has perfect

knowledge on the job-offer distribution
what is the wage associated with

(but that he does not know

any specific vacancy), that he has

an infinite time horizon, and that

job-hopping is prohibitively

expensive.3 The job seeker is faced by a stream of job offers.

Let

it be assumed, for simplicity, that these offers arrive at
a uniform
rate, and let us define the time interval

in such a way that the job

seeker samples one offer per period. Firms differ in their search

costs (e.g. the cost of ascertaining the worker's marginal productivity)

-4and consequently may offer different wages W to the same job seeker,
where W consists of non-pecuniary as well as pecuniary returns. Let
f(W) denote the density function of W.
The job hunter decides on a wage W to distinguish between those

wage offers which he deems acceptable and those which he rejects. The
search process ends as soon as the job seeker receives an offer that

exceeds W. Let W0 denote the job seeker's price of time at home; then
he accepts no wage offer that falls short of W0, i.e. W'

W0. In

general, the job seeker determines W so that any acceptable job offer
will assure him of an income stream not inferior to the one he expects

if he continues his search. Let

R denote the present value of a one

dollar wage offer accepted in Deriod n

R (l+r)
=(l+r)

t=n+l

where it is assumed that the rate of discount r is constant. Let

I be the present value of the income stream the job seeker expects
to receive if he continues his search

beyond period n (both R and

nfl- In

are discounted to period 0); then R W >

,

i.e. Wn-> In/Rn

Assuming decisions are made at the end of the period [i.e. offers
accepted in period n start yielding returns only in period (n +

1)],

the job seeker enjoys in period n an income of W0 - C, where C denotes
the costs of search which include both direct

costs (e.g. advertisement,

employment-agency fees, transportation) and indirect ones (e.g. the
value of leisure forgone owing to the search).

Given the wage offer distribution f(W) and

the asking wage W*,there

seeker in period n + 1 is faced by the same conditions facing the job

seeker in period n. Hence, the same optimum strategy that was employed
in period n will be adopted in period (n +

Consequently, the present value of the returns to search in period n
(discounted to period n) should equal the present value of the returns

Moreover, since the returns to entry into the labor force [i.e.

are a diminishing function of W0, and since the cost of

search (C) may increase with W°, this change increases the tendency to
abstain from entering the labor market.
Given W0, an upward shift in the wage offer distribution, i.e.
an increase in the mean wage offer distribution

[other parameters

of f(W) remaining constant], increases the returns to search and hence

the probability of labor force participation and wage demands. However,

The Wage Offer Distribution versus The Observed Wage Distribution:
The Selectivity Bias
The model described in the previous section analyzes the job seeker's

search strategy. One can design a somewhat similar model to describe
the employer's search policy. There are still some unresolved
problems: how do the two strategies interact and what is the process
that determines simultaneously the rate of unemployment, the vacancy

rate, and the distribution of wages. The formulation of such a model
is clearly beyond the scope of this paper. At the risk of being

unrigorous I shall therefore adopt a partial-equilibrium

approach.

I

assume that the wage-offer distribution is given and is not affected by

the job seeker's strategy.6 Under this strong assumption, the observed
wage distribution is a subset of the wage-offer distribution, i.e. that
part of the distribution which is acceptable to the job seeker.
Wage data constitute a prime source of information for the estimation

-9-

of labor supply and demand, the determinants and the effects of the
investment in human capital (e.g. schooling, on-the-job training,

health, migration) and the analysis of occupational choice. Objections
have been raised to the indiscriminate use of such data which usually
reflect only the average pecuniary returns to a person's labor before

the deduction of taxes. hence they do not allow a distinction between
the marginal wage and the average wage, do not account for non-pecuniary
returns (i.e. psychic income) and the value of on-the-job training, and
are overstated to the extent that work involves direct costs (e.g.
commuting) and that the supply of labor is affected by after-tax wages.
Several ingenious methods haVe been devised to overcome these
shortcomings.

One bias that seems to have escaped economists' attention is

that introduced by the search process. Given the wage-offer
distribution, the bolder a person's search strategy (i.e. the higher
one's asking wage W*) the higher the wage he expects to accept. Thus, the
observed wage distribution has to be adjusted for differences in the
search policy.

Nowhere is this bias more serious than in the case of the secondary

labor-force groups. These groups are characterized by partial
participation in the labor force, indicating that portions of the wage
offer distribution faced by these groups are considered too low to be

acceptable. The observed wage distribution is a truncated section of
the wage-offer distribution and its parameters depend on the parameters

of f(W) as well as on the truncation point W. Unless variations in
are corrected for one is bound to obtain biased estimates of the

W

- 10 -

parameters of f(W).
Let us consider two groups of women who face the same wage-offer
distribution, f(W), have the same costs of search, C, and the same

discount rate. Let it also be assumed that both groups have the same
price-of-time distribution except that the mean price of time (IIWO) of
one group is higher than that of the second [let these distributions be
denoted

by g(W0 - K), where K1 >

K2 > 0

and dPo =

dKJ.

Since both

groups face the same opportunities f(W) and have the same costs of

search, they

have the same critical price of time, i.e. the price that

- (rC/P0)].

Their labor force

JWOg(wO - K)dW0

(15)

.

This rate is inversely related to the mean price of time (and to K)

do =

_(W°)d0.

(16)

Given the wage-offer distribution, the price of time w9 determines

the asking wage W, which in turn determines the average acceptable wage
E1. Given a sufficiently long period of search (a large enough n), the
average wage of the labor force participants in a certain group equals
E(EIW° < W0) =

F

It

can be shown that when g(W0) is log-convex (a property which

(17)

— 11

—

holds for most functions which we have in mind) a leftward shift in the
price-of-time distribution (i.e. a decline in K) results in a reduction

of the wage demands and the average wage,7 d/dPwo >

0.

For example, let us assume two groups of married women, say whites
and non-whites, with the same market characteristics (e.g. education

and work experience), If there were no discrimination, and ignoring
differences in psychic incomes, both groups should face the same wage
offer distribution f(W) (Figure 1).

But, if an average white woman

places on her time at home a higher value (W0)' than an average non-

white because of her husband's higher earnings and the existence of
other sources of income, her wage demands (W*) will be higher, and
her realized average wage CE) will be higher, though the probability
that she participates in the labor force may be lower. A comparison
of the average wages of working women belonging to the two groups
and

may lead to the conclusion that non-white women are

discriminated against, while in effect discrimination is nonexistent.

On the other hand, if the two groups have the same price-of-

time distribution, the same C and r, and the same wage-offer
distribution except for a shift factor, then by (11) and (14) the
difference in the critical price of time (W0) between the two groups
is equal to the difference between their mean wage offers. We shall
expect the group with the higher mean wage offer to have the higher

• participation rate [d0/dp = dO/dW0 = g(W0) >

0].

The increase in the

average wage however falls short of the increase in the mean wage offer,

Thus, if it is assumed that education affects market productivity
(and hence the wage-offer distribution) but does not affect non-market
productivity and the price of time, women with higher education are

expected to have a higher participation rate. The average wage of these
women however increases more slowly than their mean wage offers. These
conclusions will hold even if we remove the assumption that education
does not affect non-niarket productivity as long as it is assumed that

its effect on market productivity exceeds that of non-market productivity
(see Figure 2).

wage comparisons of whites and non-whites and of women with
different levels of education are two of the cases that may be affected

by what may be called the "selectivity bias." In the remaining part of
this section I shall discussafew other cases where this kind of bias
may be prevalent.
I'lale-female wage differentials: Over 95 percent of males in the prime

age groups (25-55) participate in the labor force (U.S. Statistical
Abstract. 1971, p. 21), while the rate of participation of females, and
in particular married women, almost never exceeds 55 percent (ibid., p. 24).

The difference in participation can be explained by the lower wage-offer
distribution facing women, and probably by their higher value of time in

the absence of market opportunities. Both factors tend to increase the
difference between the average acceptable wage and the mean wage offer.
It has been estimated (Fuchs, 1971) that female average hourly

earnings adjusted for color, schooling, age, city size, marital status,
class of worker, and length of work-trip constituted in 1959 only two
thirds of the hourly earnings of non-farm males. Given the "selectivity

bias"

-

it seems that this figure underestimates the "true" male-female wage

differentials.

Age-wage profiles:

Labor force participation rates of males vary

very little in the 25-54 age-groups, decline somewhat (to a level of
about 80 percent) in the 55-64 group and fall very steeply (to 25

percent) thereafter. Female participation rates have a bimodal
distribution with peaks in the 20-24 and 45-54 age groups (iJ.

Statistical Abstract 1971, p. 24). These variations in the
participation rates may bias the estimates of the age-wage profiles.
Age-wage profiles (or age-earning profiles) are used frequently to
estimate the rate of depreciation of human capital (Rosen, 1972) and the

rates of return to education and on-the-job training. Retirement

may

introduce a bias in the estimate of the rate of depreciation and

obsolescence of human capital. The direction of the bias is however
indeterminate.

it depends on who is the first to retire, those with the

high wage offers or those with the low wage offers. The increase in
non-human capital with age may increase the shadow price of time, which
will rise more for those who benefited over time from the

higher wage

offers, so that they will be the first to retire. On the other hand,
the margin between the market wage and the home wage is smallest for
those at the lower tail of the wage distribution.

Any deterjorjatjonin

wage offers may therefore make them leave the labor force.
Likewise, as argued above, inter-educational variations in the

participation rates may bias the estimated rate of return on

investment in human capital of women. It is well established that
women's labor force participation increases with education.

Put

-16-

differently, an increase in education shifts the wage-offer distribution
by more than it increases the woman's price of time at home (the latter
increases either because of the effect education may have on her home
productivity and/or because of the increased, probability that she is

married to a man with higher earnings).

Ignoring the effect education

may have on the dispersion of the wage-offer distribution, the
difference between the observed average wage rate (E) and the mean

wage-offer distribution shrinks with education.8 The difference between
the observed wages of working women in two education groups therefore
tends to understate the difference between their mean wage offers and
the estimated rate of return to education.
It has been argued (Michael and Lazear, 1971) that the woman's wage
rate may be affected by the number and age composition of her children.
The existence of young children increases the demand for the wife's time
at home and her price of time and reduces her tendency to participate

in the labor force. Leaving the labor market may accelerate the
depreciation of the woman's market-oriented skills and shift her wage-

offer distribution downward. However, the decline in the wage-offer
distribution does not necessarily result in a decline in the observed

wage of working mothers. If the increase in these women's wage demands
is sufficiently large it will offset the decline in the wage offers
and result in an increase in the observed average wage.9
The determinants of ].abor force participation:

Labor force

participation increases with the mean of the wage-offer distribution

and declines with W0. A prerequisite for the estimation of the
determinants of participation is knowledge of the distribution of the

- 17

price

-

of time at home (Ben-Porath, 1973; Gronau, 1973b; Lewis, 1971).

However, this information is insufficient unless supplemented by

knowledge of the mean wage offer. Replacing the latter by the average
observed wage yields only imperfect estimates of the parameters of the

labor force participation function, unless dne knows the relationship
between the average wage and the mean wage offer (dE/dpw).
It was shown that an increase in the mean wage offer

leads to

an increase in the observed wage (E), but that this increase is smaller
than the original shift in p. Differences ii% the observed wages of
different, say, education groups therefore tend to understate the
difference between the mean wage offers and to overstate the

sensitivity of participation rates of changes in wages. Furthermore,
since the correlation between

and E is not perfect, the

misspecification of the wage variable introduces errors of measurement
into the equation which may also bias the other estimates of the
determinants of labor force participation.

The Estimation of the Wage Offer Distribution
The observed wage distribution is only one section of the wage-offer

distribution, namely those wages that exceed the asking wage W* where
the price of time of the job seeker falls short of W0. To prevent the
kind of selectivity bias discussed in the preceding section the original

wage-offer distribution must be generated. The derivation of the wageoffer distribution from the truncated observed distribution is a
difficult task even if the point of truncation (i.e. W*) is known, and it
verges on the impossible when W* and its determinants, i.e. the price of
time, the costs of search, and the rate of discount are not known. In the

is therefore merely illustrative, serving, it is hoped, as

a base point for future research.

Let it be assumed that the job seeker is aware of the best offer
he can attain10 W and let his policy be to stay out the labor force if
his price of time W0 exceeds his best offer W and otherwise to accept the

wage offer W. Given these oversimplified assumptions the participation

The Data and the Results
To estimate the wage-offer distribution I used the 1960 Census 1/1000
sample.

I focused on married women, the sample consisting of 26,530

women belonging to urban primary families, spouse present. Assuming that
the mean of the wage-offer distribution is a function of race, age,
education, and number of children, the data were subclassified by these

characteristics: 2 race groups (white, negro) x 4 age groups (below
30, 30-39, 40-49, 50+) x 4 education groups (elementary school, high

school, college, and graduate studies)x 3 groups for number of children

below the age of 6 (0,1,2+). Since it was assumed that the wife's
price of time in the absence of market opportunities is, in addition to
these factors, a function of income, the data were further divided by

income excluding wife's earnings (12 groups: less than $2,000, 2,0002,999, 3,000-3,999,...,9,000-g,999, 10,000-14,999, 15,000-19,999, and
20,000-f).14 This subclassification yielded 1,152 cells which are the

basic observations of my sample.

For each cell I computed two statistics: (a) the labor force
participation rate of women belonging to the cell (i.e. the percentage
of women working or looking for work during the week preceding the
census), and (b) the average hourly wage rate of working women

belonging to the cell. The 1960 census did not contain any direct
evidence on the hourly wage rate and I had to do with an imperfect
substitute, defining the hourly wage as the ratio of the woman's 1959
earnings divided by the product of the number of weeks she worked in

- 21

-

1959 and the number of hours she worked during the week preceding the

census. Finally, to rule out the possibility of negative mean wage
offers, the assumption of bivariate normality was replaced by the

assumption of bivariate log-normality. Thus, instead of computing the
usual arithmetic mean wage rate I computed the arithmetic mean of the

natural logarithm of the wage rates. The dependent variable E in
equation (25) therefore denotes the natural logarithm of the geometric
mean of the hourly wage rates.

Equation (25) was estimated for 4 groups: whites with no children
under 6 years old, whites with one child under 6, whites with two or

more children under 6 and non-whites with no children under 6 (the other

two groups are too small to allow estimation). The results are presented
in Table i.15 All the regressions are significant and all the
coefficients of X are positive as expected (they are significant in

means of the hourly wage rates.
Figure 3 demonstrates two of the salient features of the age-wage

profiles of married women. The first of these, often discussed in the
literature, is their flatness. Thus, except for the wages of women
graduates, there is very little change in the average wage of working

married women over their life cycle.16 The second feature, one rarely

commented on, is the fact that the profiles show no tendency to slope
downward as a result of negative net investment in human capital. 17
The replacement of the average wage of working women by the imputed
median wage offers has very little effect on the slope of the early
parts of the age profiles, but reverses the slope of the later segment

(the exception again being the graduate group). It seems that a
married woman faces her peak wage offer at the age of 30-40 when she has
elementary or high school education, and at the age of 40-50 when she
is a graduate.18
Sixteen observations are too small a sample to derive any strong

conclusions. Still, at the risk of seeming foolhardy,

i could not

resist the temptation to apply to the observations in Table 2 some of
the techniques devised and applied with such success by Jacob Mincer

(1972) to earnings of prime-age males. Assuming that schooling and
on-the-job training involve no direct costs, and that the ratio of
"time-equivalent" investment in on-the-job training declines linearly
with age (Mincer, 1972, Ch. 3) I estimated the function
E = b0 + b1S + b2T + b3T2,
'(26)

where S denotes the number of

years of schooling (it was assumed that

these are 8, 12, 15 and 18 for the four education
and T denotes the number of
T = age

-

S - 8).

groups, respectively),

years of working experience (defined19 as

To correct for heteroscedasticity each of the

observations was weighted by the number of working women belonging to

that age-education group.2° The results of equation (26) are compared
with the estimates of a similar regression equation in which the

- 26

estimated

-

median wage offer is the dependent variable (see Table 3).

The strong multico].linearity between the variable T and its

square (the simple correlation coefficient is 0.97) undermines the
reliability of the estimated effect of market experience.21

Keeping the

shakiness of the evidence in mind, it is still iDteresting to compare

the coefficients of T and T2. Thus, while the coefficients of both I
and T2 in the regression of the average wage rate are positive, implying
an upward sloping age-wage profile, the coefficient of 12 is negative

when the dependent variable is the imputed wage offers, as one would
expect. The wage offers increase at an ever diminishing rate,
reflecting the decline in investment in human capital over the life

cycle. An absolute decline in wage offers sets in after 25-30 years of
experience (-b2/b3 =

27).

Assuming that education has the same effect on the productivity of
time in all its uses- (e.g. work in the market, work at home, education

and leisure) the coefficient of years of schooling in equation (26)
measures the rate of return to formal education (Mince; 1972, Ch.

3).

The comparison of the coefficient of S in the regression of the wage
rate with that of the mean wage offer confirms our prior expectations.
The use of the observed wage rather than the imputed wage offer tends

to bias downward the estimated rate of return to schooling. The extent
of the bias increases when the experience variables (T and 12) are
omitted from the regression.

The data on the average wage rates in the other three groups (white
women with young children and non-whites with no young children) ,and
consequently the other three regressions ,show no clear systematic pattern

behavior, and I have not attempted to apply equation (26) to these
22

groups,

but have made do with a comparison of the average wage and

wage offers of the women belonging to these groups. This comparison
is contained in Table 4.

The first line of Table 4 describes the (geometric) average wage
of working women belonging to the four groups investigated in our

study. There are only slight differences in average wages between the
three groups of white women, regardless of the number of young
children, and there exists a substantial gap between the wage enjoyed
by white women and that of non-whites, the latter being less than two

thirds of the former. As the second line of this table indicates, this
pattern is little affected by using as weights the total number of
women belonging to a cell rather than the number of the working women
belonging to the cell.
The average wage of each group naturally depends on its age and

educational composition. To standardize for differences in composition
one has to use a uniform weighting scheme. The weights used to compute
the "standardized potential wage rate" (line 3) are the number of white
women without young children belonging to the age and education group.
The isolation of the age and education effect only slightly reduces the
white non-white differential (from 0.61 to 0.65) but changes the wage

hierarchy of the white women. Thus, while the unstandardized figures
give an edge to women without young children (the wage of women with
2 young children being 87 percent of the wage of women without young
children) this relationship is reversed when one accounts for age and
education differences between the groups (the ratio becoming 1.07).

These figures thus appear to contradict the hypothesis that
children
result in accelerated depreciation of the mother's market skills.23

The replacement of the average wage by the standardized imputed
median wage offer (line 4) leads to significant changes in the

observed wage pattern. The effect of children on the mother's wage
offers turns out to be a prominent feature of the wage structure. The
wage a white mother with two young children can expect to get in the
market is only two thirds of that of a woman belonging to the same
age-education group who does not have young children.

(On the other

hand, one young child does not seem to affect his mother's

wage offers.)

Furthermore, the removal of the selectivity bias seems to remove over
one half of the white/non-white differential (non-whites'

wage offers

being 85 percent of those of whites), calling for major revisions in the
evaluation of the importance of discrimination as a factor affecting
the wage structure of non-white women.
On the other hand, it seems that the estimate of the male-female

differential must be revised upwards. The median wage offer of
married women is only about 70 percent of the standardized average wage.

Since the male labor-force participation rate is close to 100 percent,
the data on their wages is hardly affected by the selectivity bias (X

being very close to zero). The comparison of wage offers of males and
females would therefore show a substantially larger differential than
the 3:2 ratio quoted earlier in this paper.
Finally, it has been argued (Lewis, 1971) that using the average
wage of working women rather than their mean wage offer results in an

upward bias in the estimated effect of wages on labor force

participation.

-31-

I have elsewhere (Gronau, l973a) used the results presented in Table 2
to estimate the price-of-time distribution and the implicit participation

function of American married women. Employing probit analysis I examined
the effect of the woman's and her husband's age and education, family
income, and the number and age composition of the children on her
price of time, i.e. her labor force participation (I allowed the
effect of children to differ according to their mother's education).

The results of this analysis are reproduced in Table 5, where one
regression contains the (geometric) average wage rate of working women
as an explanatory variable, and the other regression uses our estimate

of
These results clearly confirm our expectations. The introduction
of the wage offers as an explanatory variable considerably reduces the

estimated wage effect. The misspecification of the wage variable also
affects the estimated effects of other variables, notably the wife's

age and education.24 We have seen earlier that the observed wage of
working women belonging to the 50+ age group considerably overstates

the wage offers faced by their non-working counterparts. The decline
in labor force participation witnessed in that group is therefore

attributed to age, while essentially it is merely a wage effect.
Likewise, changes in the observed wage tend to understate the changes
in the wage offers associated with an increase in education.

Using the

average wage of working women tends to overplay the direct effect of
education on labor force participation.25

The data on the hourly wage rate used in our estimates are far from

perfect. One might prefer a long term measure of participation, say,

annual rather than weekly participation. Data problems are enhanced by
a set of admittedly very strong assumptions, notably the assumption of

homoscedasticity of the price of time and the wage-offer distribution.
Finally, the estimation model is based on a search model that is

clearly sub-optimal. Thus one should regard the results of this
section as no more than an empirical

exercise. One should strive to

overcome these shortcomings by using a better suited body of data, by
assuming a different joint distribution of W and W0 that calls for
weaker assumptions, or by focusing on a different statistic (e.g. the
standard deviation of the

wage of working women).26 Nevertheless, it

seems, at least to me, that the evidence collected here is a strong
enough warning that comparisons of wage data should take selectivity
bias into account.

Becker, Stanley Diller, Victor Fuchs, James Hckman, Thomas Juster and

Esther Samuel. Finally, I would like to thank Margo Faier for her
devoted research assistance.

'The economics of information date back to Stigler's seminal

papers (1961, 1962) in the early 1960's. The theory gained renewed
popularity in the early 1970's in the context of the microeconomic
analysis of the Phillips curve (Gronau 1971, McCall 1970, Morténsen 1970,

Phelps 1970). For other applicatjonsand a survey of the theory see
Nelson, 1970 and Rothschild, 1971.
2One

of

the few exceptions is Lewis (1971).

3Thus, I rule out a search strategy that calls for the job seeker to
accept the first job offered, continue his search while on the job,and
switch to a better job as soon as it becomes available. This kind of
strategy is inconsistent with voluntary unemployment.
Admittedly, this model, first proposed in the literature by McCall
(1970) and Mortensen (1970), is based on somewhat simplified assumptions.
The use of a more sophisticated approach would

not have affected

our major conclusion that there is a positive correlation between the
initial wage demands and

the

accepted wage.

4For a more rigorous proof of this statement see McCall (1970) and

Mortensen (1970). This conclusion does not hold if the ob seeker's
time horizon is finite, if imperfections in the capital market result
in an increase in r as the search proceeds, if there are increasing
costs of search, if current earnings (e.g. marginal utility of leisure)
diminish, or if the job seeker changes his evaluation of f(W) as the
result of the search (see Gronau, 1971).

Rearranging terms, one obtains equation (6).

job seeker's search strategy and adapts his wage offer accordingly.

a constant which is independent of W0 (it depends on

W0, K1 and K2). Thus hK(WO) has a monotone likelihood ratio if
g(W0 - K) has one, a necessary and sufficient condition for which is

that -log g is convex (Lehman 1959, p. 330).
Since E has been shown to be a nondecreasing function of W0, and if
hK(WO) has a monotone likelihood ratio in W0

f

=

EhK(WO)dWO

is a nondecreasing function of K (ibid., p. 74).

However, I have not recalculated the t coefficients. Thus, the t.

the base group (i.e. they serve to test the hypotheses H0 :

flatness may be partly due to a cohort effect, and does not
necessarily imply that women entering the labor force now can expect no
increase in their wage rates.

-42-

170f course, this may be merely due to the crude aggregation of

the wage data. The expected downward sloping portion of the age-wage
profilemjghthave emerged had I used a more refined age classification.
However, it is noteworthy that Arleen Leibowitz, who fitted a quadratic
function to data of weekly wages of married women who are full time
workers, found that the wage rates tend to decrease only after 43
years of experience when the woman is a high school graduate, and after

60 years of experience when she has 13 years of schooling or more

(Leibowitz 1972, p. 43). This would imply that the peak of the age-wage
profile is reached at the age of 61 if the woman is a high school
graduate and at the age of 83 if she finished college (the regression
coefficients in the case of elementary school are insignificant).
18The negatively sloping portion of the wage-offer profiles may, of

course, be due purely to inter-cohort differences.
19Age is assumed to be 26, 35, 45 and 55 in the four age groups,
respectively.

20The major conclusions of this analysis would not have changed had
I used a different weighting scheme, e.g. estimating an unweighted

regression or weighting each observation by the total number of women
belonging to that group.

210ne should

and T2

not conclude from the low t-values associated with T

that length of work experience does not play any role in the

determination of wage rates of married women. The omission of T2 from
equation (26) results in the coefficient of T becoming significantly
different from zero (see also Leibowitz 1972, p. 43).

22Any attempt of this kind in the case of white women with

young

children would have proved futile in the face of the large number of
empty cells in these groups.
23This statement has to be qualified since the results
presented in

Table 4 are not standardized for the

number of children older than six.

24i owe this point to Robert E. Hall. Note that the effect of
the

misspecifjcatjon of the wage wariable on the estimated effect of any

variable

on the housewife's price of time is indeterminate.

This effect

is measured as the ratio of the probit coeffic±ents of that variable
and the coefficient of the wage variable. The effect of the
misspecificatjon in this case therefore depends on the direction and
magnitude of the bias in both probit coefficients.

For example, though

the education coefficient is biased (in absolute terms) upward, the
effect of education on the woman's price of time remains unchanged when

E is replaced by

26A set of data that seems very alluring in this context is the
National Longitudinal Survey: Survey of Work Experience of Females
30-44

(the "Ohio Survey") which contains information on the asking

wage of non-working women.

Analysis of the variance of the observed wage distribution (S) may
yield further insights into the problems discussed above, since it can
