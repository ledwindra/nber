Economic Growth and Convergence, Applied Especially to China
Robert J. Barro
NBER Working Paper No. 21872
January 2016
JEL No. O11,O4,O47
ABSTRACT
From the perspective of conditional convergence, China’s GDP growth rate since 1990 has been surprisingly
high. However, China cannot deviate forever from the global historical experience, and the per capita
growth rate is likely to fall soon from around 8% per year to a range of 3 4%. China can be viewed
as a middle-income convergence-success story, grouped with Costa Rica, Indonesia, Peru, Thailand,
and Uruguay. Upper-income convergence successes comprise Chile, Hong Kong, Ireland, Malaysia,
Poland, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan. China’s transition from middle- to upper-income status
should not be hindered by a middle-income trap, which seems not to exist. The cross-country dispersion
of the log of per capita GDP shows no trend since 1870 for 25 countries with long-term data. This
group excludes emerging-market countries such as China and India. For 34 countries with data since
1896, there is clear evidence of declining dispersion starting around 1980. This pattern reflects especially
the incorporation of China and India into the world market economy.

My main goal is to assess China’s past and prospective economic growth. Appraising a single
country in isolation is not possible, and I therefore position China within the context of growth
experienced by a large number of countries over long periods. More specifically, I use the wellknown framework of conditional convergence applied empirically in the form of cross-country
growth regressions.1
I. Conditional Convergence and Cross-Country Growth Regressions
My empirical analysis of the determinants of economic growth relies on two data sets.
The first applies to 89 countries observed from 1960 to 2010. An important feature of these data
is the availability of information not only on real per capita GDP but also on a broad array of
explanatory variables—called “X variables”—that help to predict economic growth.
The second data set applies over a much longer period, 1870-2010. For this purpose, I
use the long-term data on real per capita GDP constructed recently by Jose Ursúa. 2 These data
are particularly useful for the estimation of convergence effects. Specifically, well-known
econometric problems3 in estimating coefficients of lagged dependent variables (central to the
gauging of convergence rates) are eased in the presence of long time series. Moreover, it turns
out that the 140 years of the second data set is long in this context, whereas the 50 years of the
first data set is still too short. Disadvantages of the second data set are the much smaller number
of countries with long-term data on real per capita GDP—28 in my context—compared to the 89
in the first data set. In addition, many fewer X variables are available over the long term, even
for the countries with information on GDP.

This approach began with Barro (1991).
See Ursúa (2011). These data, available on my website at Harvard University, cover 42 countries with annual data
on real per capita GDP starting at least by 1913.

Table 1 reports the basic regression results for the two data sets. Column 1 (which comes
from Barro [2015, Table 1, column 3]) is for 89 countries observed over five-year intervals from
1960 to 2010. The dependent variable is the growth rate per year of real per capita GDP.4 The
right-hand side variables include the five-year lag of the log of real per capita GDP. The
estimated coefficient of this variable gives the conditional convergence rate—for example, the
value -0.017 shown in column 1 of the table implies a conditional convergence rate of 1.7% per
year. The conditioning variables (X variables) in this specification are for life expectancy at
birth, total fertility rate, indicators of law and order (rule of law) and democracy, ratios to GDP
of investment and government consumption, female and male average years of school
attainment, the openness ratio (exports plus imports relative to GDP), a measure of changes in
the terms-of-trade, and the inflation rate.
The estimation in column 1 uses ordinary least squares and excludes country fixed effects
(but has different constant terms for each time period). Barro (2015, section 4) argues that the
exclusion of country fixed effects is important for minimizing bias of the Hurwicz (1950)Nickell (1981) type in the estimated coefficient of the lagged dependent variable. With country
fixed effects excluded, the inclusion of the array of X variables is crucial for minimizing
omitted-variables bias. The main results, especially for the conditional-convergence rate, are
robust to estimating by two-stage least-squares (with lagged values of the X variables used as
instruments) and to changes in the list of X variables.
A principal finding in Table 1, column 1, is that the estimated convergence
coefficient, -0.0170 (s.e.=0.0021), is significantly negative and indicates convergence at close to
the “iron-law” rate of 2% per year. If the other explanatory variables were unchanging, the

work force and employment are subject to large measurement errors in developing countries.

convergence of real per capita GDP would be toward a level implied by the long-run values of
the other explanatory variables (adjusted for a worldwide trend).
The other results indicate significantly positive effects on growth (given initial per capita
GDP) from initial life expectancy, the law-and-order (rule-of-law) indicator, the investment ratio,
international openness, and improvements in the terms of trade. Negative effects relate to the
initial fertility rate and the inflation rate. The estimated impact of the democracy indicator is
non-linear; positive at low values but eventually becoming negative. The relation with initial
years of schooling is surprisingly weak, perhaps because the variable measures years of
education rather than the quality of this education. In general, the results for a particular X
variable tend to be sensitive to changes in the list of independent variables. However, the
general pattern that emerges robustly is a positive impact on growth from changes that can be
construed as favorable for the workings of private markets or for productivity. 5
Table 1, column 2 (which comes from Barro [2015, Table 5, column 4]), shows the
results for the long-term panel of 28 countries from 1870 to 2010. Because few X variables are
available, the omitted-variables problem would seriously impact the estimation of the coefficient
of the lagged dependent variable if country fixed effects were excluded. Fortunately, the
inclusion of these effects does not produce a large bias of the Hurwicz (1950)-Nickell (1981)
variety when the sample length is 140 years. The main result in column 2 is the estimated
coefficient on the lagged dependent variable of -0.0262 (s.e.=0.0041). That is, conditional
convergence appears at 2.6% per year.

5

The results do not depend much on the observation interval, taken to be five years in Table 1. The main findings,
particularly on the conditional convergence rate, are similar with the variables observed at ten- or one-year intervals.
However, an annual regression is problematic because many of the right-hand-side variables are not really observed
at an annual frequency.

4

Barro (2015, section 6) argues that the true coefficient on the lagged dependent variable
is likely bracketed by the value -0.017 in column 1 (1960-2010) and -0.026 in column 2 (18702010). The reasoning is that the column-1 estimate likely reflects some remaining omittedvariables bias (which tends to lower the magnitude of the estimated coefficient), whereas the
column-2 estimate likely retains some Hurwicz-Nickell bias (which tends to raise the magnitude
of the estimated coefficient). The iron-law convergence rate of 2% per year falls into the interval
between the two point estimates.
II. Applying the Global History to China’s Economic Growth
Table 3 uses the results from Table 1, column 1, to assess actual and model-estimated
economic growth for China from 1960 to 2010. In the early parts of the sample, the actual
growth rate of real per capita GDP was well below the model-implied value. That is,
convergence was occurring at a rate well below the typical cross-country experience. To put it
another way, because China was so poor in this period, economic growth should have been more
rapid, even after taking into account the generally unfavorable nature of the X variables.
In contrast, Table 3 shows that the Chinese growth rate tended to exceed the modelimplied value since 1990—the residual is substantially positive in three of the last four five-year
periods. Notably, for 2005-2010, the actual per capita growth rate of 8.9% per year was sharply
above the fitted value of 4.2%. In other words, if one takes the measured GDP numbers at face
value, China has been converging over the last two decades toward middle- and upper-income
status at a rate far greater than anticipated from the global historical experience (given the values
of China’s X variables).
Of course, it would be great to attenuate the residuals shown in Table 3 by incorporating
more explanatory variables, some possibly specific to China. One idea, possibly not already
5

fully reflected in the X variables included in the panel regression, is that China was largely
closed to private enterprise and international markets in the early part of the sample, especially
until around 1980, and then became much more pro-market (or capitalist?). The challenge would
be to model these forces in a consistent way across countries and over time. That is, the
suggested route amounts to measuring additional X variables and incorporating them into the
regression system. I readily agree that other researchers may do better in this respect that the
panel regression reported in Table 1, column 1.
It is also possible to use the results from Table 1, column 1, to project China’s economic
growth into the future. For this purpose, I use the values of China’s explanatory variables for the
most recent year available.6 The result is a projected per capita growth rate as of 2015 by 3.5%
per year (with subsequent growth rates declining in accordance with a typical convergence
process). This projection is sharply below official five-year forecasts of real GDP growth of
around 6-7% per year (which should be adjusted downward by about 0.5% per year to account
for population growth). Of course, consistent with the model’s under-estimation of Chinese
economic growth in the 2000s (as shown in Table 3), the model may be under-predicting growth
from 2015 on. But it is unlikely that China’s growth rate can deviate in the long run from the
results predicted by international experience within a conditional-convergence framework. In
particular, it is not possible for China’s per capita GDP growth rate to exceed 6% per year in the
long run.

6

Values for 2014 were real per capita GDP of 12609 (2011 international dollars), life expectancy at birth of 75.4
years (for 2013), total fertility rate of 1.7 (for 2013), law-and-order (rule-of-law) indicator of 0.58 (0-1 scale),
political rights indicator of 0 (0-1 scale), investment ratio of 0.37, government consumption ratio of 0.15, openness
ratio of 0.42, years of female schooling of 8.2, years of male schooling of 9.2, inflation rate of 0.020 per year. The
future change in the terms of trade was assumed to be zero.

III. Convergence Success Stories across the World
China through 2014 can be viewed as a convergence success story, in the sense that the
strong economic growth over a sustained period led to a level of real per capita GDP that can be
characterized as middle income. To put the Chinese accomplishment into international
perspective, I calculated all the convergence success stories in the world based on reasonable,
though somewhat arbitrary, criteria. Specifically, I propose that one criterion for a convergence
success is a doubling or more of real per capita GDP from 1990 to 2014 (implying average per
capita growth by at least 2.9% per year). Secondly, I define a middle-income success as
attainment of a level of real per capita GDP in 2014 of at least $10000 (on a purchasing-powerparity basis in 2011 international dollars7). An upper-income success requires a level of real per
capita GDP in 2014 at least twice as high; that is, at least $20000.
Table 4 shows the cases of middle- and upper-income successes. Aside from China, the
middle-income successes comprise Indonesia, Peru, Thailand, and Uruguay. (Uruguay was a
surprise; a possible explanation is the extensive migration of high human-capital people away
from Argentina, which has been following strikingly anti-market policies.) One additional
country that almost made this list is Costa Rica (average per capita growth rate since 1990 of
2.8% per year).
The upper-income successes comprise seven economies: Chile, Ireland, Malaysia,
Poland, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan. Hong Kong almost made this list (average per
capita growth rate since 1990 of 2.8% per year). Some of these upper-income successes—
Singapore, Hong Kong, and Ireland—are now among the world’s richest economies.
One way to think about convergence is to ask what characteristics of economies underlie
the attainment of middle- or upper-income convergence success. For example, for China, one

might emphasize the opening up to international markets and capitalism in the 1980s. For India
(not yet rich enough to make the middle-income list in Table 4), one might focus on the partial
relaxation of socialistic restraints and other governmental regulations since the mid-1980s.
However, this approach does not really differ from the one pursued in the form of cross-country
growth regressions in Table 1, column 1. The only difference is that some basic changes in
country institutions can, perhaps, be identified qualitatively but cannot be quantified in the form
of X variables that apply across countries and over time.
A view that seems to have gained popularity recently at the World Bank and elsewhere is
the “middle-income trap.” For a survey and a largely skeptical analysis of this phenomenon, see
Bulman, Eden, and Nguyen (2014). According to the trap hypothesis, the successful transition
from low- to middle-income status is often followed by barriers that impede a further transition
to upper income.
My view is that this idea is a myth. Moving from low- to middle income-income status,
as for the middle-income success stories in the upper part of Table 4, is challenging. In
particular, according to the criteria applied in the table, this status requires at least a doubling of
real per capita GDP from 1990 to 2014. The required average per capita growth rate of 2.9% per
year, sustained over 24 years, is well above the typical experience (featuring an average per
capita growth rate around 2.0% per year). Conditional on having achieved middle-income status,
the further transition to upper-income status requires another extended period of well-aboveaverage economic growth. Again, this transition is challenging, but there is no evidence that this
second transition (conditional on having achieved the first goal) is more difficult than the first.
In this sense, a middle-income trap is not different from a lower-income trap.

IV. Cross-Country Dispersion of Per Capita GDP
The concept of convergence discussed thus far pertains to whether countries that are
poorer (in absolute terms or in relation to their own steady-state position) tend to grow faster
than richer ones. In Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1991), this concept is called β-convergence and is
distinguished from another form (σ-convergence) that relates to a possible tendency for the
cross-sectional dispersion of per capita GDP to decline over time. This dispersion can be
measured in proportionate terms by the cross-sectional standard deviation of the log of per
capita GDP for a group of economies. In this context, sigma convergence corresponds to
declining inequality at the level of countries.
If all countries have the same steady-state per capita GDP, then the existence of β
convergence tends to reduce the cross-sectional dispersion over time. However, if individual
country shocks are present, these shocks tend to raise dispersion. With purely idiosyncratic
country shocks, the cross-sectional variance would tend to approach a value that depends
positively on the variance of the shocks and negatively on the rate of β convergence. The crosssectional variance tends to fall over time if it starts above its steady-state value but tends,
otherwise, to rise over time (even though β convergence is present). If the sample comprises a
large number of countries that have existed with fixed underlying parameters for a long time, the
cross-sectional variance will tend at any point in time to be close to its long-run value, and the
dispersion will be roughly stable over time.8
More generally, countries differ in their long-run or steady-state levels of real per capita
GDP, and the X variables included in Table 1, column 1, hold constant part of these long-term
8

The notion that a tendency for the poor to grow faster than the rich implies a negative trend in dispersion or
inequality is a fallacy; in fact, it is Galton’s Fallacy (Galton [1886, 1889], Quah [1993], Hart [1995]), which Galton
applied to the distribution of heights across a population. For generations of an extended family, height has positive
persistence but tends to revert to the population mean, thereby constituting a form of β convergence. Nevertheless,
the dispersion of heights across the overall population typically changes little over time.

9

differences. In this context, the measured cross-country dispersion of the log of real per capita
GDP will tend toward a value that is increasing in the long-term dispersion of the log of steadystate real per capita GDP. If a shock occurs (such as the incorporation of China and India into
the world economy around 1980) that lowers the steady-state dispersion, the actual dispersion
will tend to decline gradually following the shock toward the reduced steady-state dispersion.
The long-term data on real per capita GDP used in Table 1, column 2, can be used to
study the long-run evolution of cross-country dispersion. Figure 1 applies to the longest feasible
sample, 1870-2010, for which 25 countries (20 of which subsequently became OECD members)
have annual data on real per capita GDP. The countries are listed in the note to the figure.
Dispersion is measured by the standard deviation across countries of the log of real per capita
GDP. The blue line weights countries equally, and the red line weights by population (thereby
corresponding under some conditions to the dispersion of income for persons rather than
countries).
The blue line (equally weighted) in Figure 1 shows small changes over time. The range
is from 0.56 in 2010 to 0.71 in 1946. The main movement away from the mean of 0.65
associates with World War II—the standard deviation rose from 0.62 in 1938 to 0.71 in 1946.
During this crisis period, shocks had a high spatial correlation and affected groups of countries
differentially, thereby violating the assumption of purely idiosyncratic country shocks. 9
Otherwise, the main finding is that the cross-sectional standard deviation of the log of per capita
GDP is remarkably stable since 1870 around its mean of 0.65.

9

Similarly, in Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1991, Figure 4), the large dispersion of per capita personal income across the
U.S. states in 1880 reflects the differential impact of the Civil War on the South versus the North. However, across
the U.S. states, the long-run standard deviation for the log of per capita personal income was only around 0.2, much
smaller than that across countries.

10

The red line (population weighted) tells a similar story, except that this measure of
dispersion is more sensitive to the major crises in Russia (a relatively poor country with a large
population) during the world wars and the 1990s. In 2010, the population-weighted standard
deviation of 0.59 is close to the equally-weighted value of 0.56.
Figure 2 extends to a larger sample by using the 34 countries with GDP data starting at
least by 1896. This sample is less subject than the 25-country group used before to the sampleselection problem of tending to include countries that were rich toward the end of the sample.
The note to the figure lists the countries. Most importantly, this extension adds the world’s two
largest countries by population, China and India.
The dispersion measured by the blue line (equally weighted) in Figure 2 is higher than
that in Figure 1 because the expansion of the sample brings in several countries with per capita
GDP well below the mean. Compared to Figure 1, the blue graph in Figure 2 shows more
substantial changes over time, with the standard deviation starting at 0.87 in 1896 and rising
during the Great Depression and WWII to 1.04 in 1946. That is, the years from the early 1930s
through the mid-1940s exhibit a “great divergence,” which persists through the mid-1970s.
From there on, the standard deviation falls from 1.07 in 1974 to 0.78 in 2010. The decline of
dispersion in this last phase reflects particularly the strong growth in developing countries,
including China, India, and Indonesia.10 Possibly, in the long run, the standard deviation in this
34-country sample will fall toward the average value of 0.65 found in Figure 1—because the
added developing countries seem to be joining the richer group selected in Figure 1 (by the
criterion of having GDP data back to 1870).

10

In this respect, the sample-selection criterion in Figure 1 (25 countries having GDP data back to 1870) understates
σ convergence since the mid-1970s compared to that in Figure 2 (34 countries having GDP data back to 1896). The
long-term results in Baumol (1986, Figure 1) were the reverse—with the restriction of the sample to 16 countries
with data from Maddison (1982) back to 1870 tending to overstate σ convergence. See DeLong (1988).

11

The red line (population weighted) in Figure 2 starts with higher dispersion than the blue
line (equally weighted) because the largest countries by population, China and India, begin far
below the world mean for per capita GDP. The trend in the population-weighted series is similar
to that for the equally-weighted series in exhibiting a great divergence from the early 1930s
through the 1940s and persisting up to the mid-1970s. Thereafter, the dispersion falls sharply,
going from 1.58 in 1974 to 0.83 in 2010. This recent trend, highlighted in terms of the world
distribution of income by Sala-i-Martin (2006), reflects particularly the strong growth in China
since the late 1970s and in India since the mid-1980s.
V. Concluding Observations
China’s growth rate of real per capita GDP has been remarkably high since around 1990,
well above the rates predicted from international experience in a conditional-convergence
framework. Although country growth rates can deviate above or below their predicted values for
some time, no country, including China, can escape the “iron law of convergence” forever.
Therefore, China’s per capita growth rate is likely to decline soon from around 8% per year to a
range of 3-4%.
Economic growth at a 3-4% per capita rate is sufficient when sustained over 2-3 decades
to transition from low- to middle-income status (which China has already accomplished) and
then from middle- to high-income status (which China is likely to achieve). Thus, although these
realistic growth rates are well below recent experience, they would actually be a great
accomplishment. Perhaps the biggest challenge is that the likely prospects for China’s per capita
growth rates are well below the values of 5-6% per year implied by official forecasts.11 Thus,

11

According to Economist Intelligence Unit (2015), the Chinese government’s official forecast as of December 2015
implied by the most recent five-year plan was for an average annual real GDP growth rate around 6% from 2016 to

12

the future may bring major political tensions in reconciling economic dreams with economic
realities. Reducing the unrealistically optimistic growth expectations held inside and outside the
government would reduce the risk of this tension and lower the temptation to manipulate the
national accounts data.

2020. With population growth of about 0.5% per year, this projection corresponds to a per capita growth rate
around 5.5% per year.

Column 1:
The sample criterion is to include countries only if they have data starting by the 1970-75
period for the dependent and independent variables. The countries in the sample appear in
Table 2. The dependent variable is the annual growth rate of real per capita GDP for the ten
five-year periods: 1960-65, …, 2005-10. Lagged per capita GDP, the reciprocal of life
expectancy at birth, the total fertility rate, and female and male years of school attainment for
persons aged 15 and over are 5-year lags (for 1960, …, 2005). The ratios of investment and
government consumption to GDP, the openness ratio, the indicator for law and order (rule of
law) and the democracy indicator are five-year averages of values lagged one to five years. The
growth rate of the terms of trade and the inflation rate are for the same periods as the dependent
variable. Standard errors of coefficient estimates are in parentheses. For calculating standard
errors, the error terms are allowed to be correlated over time within countries.
Definitions and sources:
PPP-adjusted real per capita GDP is from Penn World Tables
(www.pwt.econ.upenn.edu), version 7.0, in 2005 international dollars. Data for 2010 are from
version 7.1. Also from version 7.0 are the ratios to GDP of investment (private plus public) and
government consumption and the openness ratio (exports plus imports relative to GDP). These
ratio variables use current-price information.
Life expectancy at birth and the total fertility rate are from the World Bank’s World
Development Indicators (WDI).
The law-and-order (rule-of-law) indicator is from Political Risk Services, International
Country Risk Guide. The data were converted from seven categories to a 0-1 scale, with 1
representing the highest maintenance of law and order and rule of law.
Average years of school attainment for females and males aged 15 and over at various
levels of schooling are from Barro and Lee (2015), with data available at www.barrolee.com.
These data are at 5-year intervals.
The terms-of-trade change (growth rates over five years of export prices relative to
import prices) is from International Monetary Fund, International Financial Statistics, and WDI.
This variable is interacted with the openness ratio.
The democracy indicator is the political-rights variable from Freedom House
(www.freedomhouse.org). The data were converted from seven categories to a 0-1 scale, with 1
representing the highest rights. Data on an analogous concept for 1960 and 1965 are from
Bollen (1980).
The inflation rate (averaged over 5-year intervals) is calculated from retail-price indexes
from International Monetary Fund, International Financial Statistics, and WDI.

Column 2:
The sample criterion is to include countries only if they have GDP data starting by 1896
and also have data for most of the period on years of schooling and an indicator of democracy
from Polity. This criterion selected 28 countries: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil,
Canada, Chile, China, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, New
Zealand, Norway, Peru, Portugal, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, United Kingdom,
United States, Uruguay, and Venezuela. Standard errors of coefficient estimates are in
parentheses. In calculating standard errors of coefficient estimates, the error terms are allowed to
be correlated over time within countries.
The dependent variable is the annual growth rate of real per capita GDP for the 28
countries for 28 periods: 1870-75, 1875-80, …, 2005-10. For the independent variables, the log
of lagged per capita GDP, average years of female and male school attainment for persons aged
15 and over, and the Polity indicator are five-year lags, referring to 1870, 1875, …, 2005.
Sources: GDP is from “Barro-Ursúa Macroeconomic Data,” available at
www.rbarro.com/data-sets. The Polity indicator is for democracy less autocracy (converted from
a -10 to +10 scale to a 0-1 scale, with 1 representing highest democracy), from Polity IV
(www.systemicpeace.org). The data at 5-year intervals since 1950 on female and male average
years of school attainment for persons aged 15 and over are as for column 1. Data from 1870 to
1945 at five-year intervals are estimates described in Barro and Lee (2015).

Notes: The definition of a convergence success is, first, that real per capita GDP has to at least
double from 1990 to 2014 (per capita growth rate of at least 2.9% per year). Second, a middleincome success has to reach a level of per capita GDP in 2014 of at least $10000 in 2011 U.S.
dollars. An upper-income success has to reach at least $20000.
