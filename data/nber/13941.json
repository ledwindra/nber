    "abstract": "\n\nUsing the internal March CPS, we create and in this paper distribute to the larger research community a cell mean series that provides the mean of all income values above the topcode for any income source of any individual in the public use March CPS that has been topcoded since 1976. We also describeour construction of this series. When we use this series together with the public use March CPS, we closely match the yearly mean income levels and income inequalities of the U.S. population found using the internal March CPS data.\n\n",
