THE EFFECTS OF DAYCARE RECONSIDERED
The transactional process of early daycare:
Do the children of employed mothers differ from other children, even
before mother's entry to employment? If parents seek to protect more vulnerable
infants by placing them in fewer hours of substitute care, if mothers seek respite
from the care of more "difficult" infants, or if it were easier to find substitute care
for "easier" children, then studies in the existing daycare literature may have
underestimated, or overestimated, the hazards of substitute care and maternal
employment. The present study explores the possibility that infant health,
temperament and development may have significant effects on mother's
employment.
Economists, psychologists, policy analysts, and parents continue to be
concerned about the possible effects of maternal employment on young children.
Although several studies have reported a modest cognitive advantage among
children in early daycare (eg, Blau and Grossberg, 1992; O'Brien-Caughy et al,
1994, and Burchinal et al, 1997), and other studies have reported a higher rate of
behavior problems and insecure infant-mother interactions (eg, Belsky and
Eggebeen, 1991; Lamb et al, 1992; Egeland and Heister, 1995; and Clark et al,
1997), design limitations have made it difficult to draw causal inferences from this
literature. Mothers who enter the labor force and mothers who remain at home
with their young children are known to differ from each other in a number of

possibly important ways: they may have different skills or abilities; they may be
healthy or disabled; they may have access to different resources; and they may
have different values and parenting goals. These differences, rather than maternal
employment itself, may account for the observed differences among their children.
(See Caldwell (1993) and Zazlow et al (1991) for thoughtful reviews).
Could preexisting differences among children, as well as differences among
mothers, account for any of the reported effects of daycare? It is likely, based on a
number of previous studies, that significant child disability does reduce mother's
labor force participation (see Table 1). Could mother's labor force participation
also be affected by more common kinds of differences among children?
The present study explores the possible influence of newborn health and
infant development and temperament on the timing of mother's first entry to
employment after the child's birth. The National Longitudinal Survey of Youth
provides a large and diverse sample of children, followed from birth, for whom we
have extensive information about mother's employment collected both before and
after the child's birth, reports of the child's health status at birth, and developmental
assessments in infancy and early childhood. We consider four specific indicators of
the child's health at birth (prematurity, presence of birth defect, nutritional status,
and length of hospitalization at birth), and mothers' ratings of the child's
development and fearful and difficult temperament in infancy, as predictors of the
timing of mother's first (re)entry into the labor force after the child's birth. Unlike
previous studies, we distinguish the effects of prematurity from the effects of
2

intrauterine growth retardation; we control for mother's work history before the
child's birth; and we further control for unobserved maternal background factors,
by making comparisons among siblings within the same family. Because infancy
ratings might be affected by the child's daycare experience, we compare the
predictions from infant development and temperament in the sample as a whole, to
the subset of children whose assessments took place before mother's return to
work.

Parental investment and the intrahousehold allocation of resources:
A child's health, development or temperament could influence mother's
employment in several ways. Most obviously, the child's health or temperament
could contribute to the child's observed well-being in maternal versus substitute
care (Rosenzweig and Schultz, 1983; Becker and Lewis, 1973; Becker and Tomes,
1976; Blau & Robins, 1989). The child's attractiveness to her parents could affect
the pleasure which the parents experience when spending time with her (Bell,
1971; Ritter, Casey, and Langlois, 1991); and the child's attractiveness to other
caretakers could affect the cost or the availability of substitute care. The child's
health, and the gender mix of children already in the family, could influence
whether parents choose to have another child (Rosenzweig and Wolpin, 1988;
Altmann, et al, 1978; Angrist and Evans, 1996); and one or both parents of
significantly disabled children may be tempted to abandon the parenting role
altogether (Corman and Kaestner, 1992).
3

Table 1 presents a summary of fifteen empirical studies which have
considered whether child characteristics may influence maternal employment.
Many of these studies have found that child health problems reduce the likelihood
of mother's employment, but the health or disability measures used in these studies
have referred to no more than about 6% of children in the general population.
Many daycare studies have excluded disabled children in order to control for this
potential bias. Child gender has been examined most convincingly by Angrist and
Evans (1996); they find that, in families with at two children, the gender mix of the
existing children may affect mother's later employment by influencing the
likelihood that a couple will choose to have a third child; however, child gender
itself did not predict maternal employment. Except for child gender, only three of
the studies in Table 1 have considered the possible influence of more common or
"normal" differences among children. Galambos and Lerner (using a sample from
the 1950's) find that mothers of "difficult" toddlers were less likely to be working
in the child's toddler or preschool years; in contrast, Greenberger and O'Neill
(using a sample from the 1980's) find that mothers of "difficult" preschoolers were
more likely to be working at kindergarten age; Vaughn, Gove, and Egeland (1980)
report no association between neonatal behavior assessment scores and mother's
employment status in the first two years. All three of these studies are based on
very small samples.
Both economists and evolutionary biologists have proposed formal
theoretical models considering how child characteristics might influence the intra4

household allocation of resources (Becker and Tomes, 1976; Hanushek, 1992;
Thomas, 1990; Rosenzweig and Wolpin, 1988; Trivers, 1974). When the marginal
utility of parental care is higher for the more vulnerable child, then utilitymaximization models predict that parental resources (for example, mother's time)
will be distributed so as to provide additional units of care for the more vulnerable
child. Infants reward their parents, at least in part, through occasions of physical
affection and social interaction which parents experience as joyful and loving;
"easy" infants may be more rewarding than others. If these attractions fail, infants
may also attempt to enforce parental attention through the judicious use of crying
and tantrums; "difficult" infants may be more demanding than others. If the
marginal cost of parental care, to the parent, is higher for the more "difficult" child,
then the "difficult" child may receive fewer units of care. Although the simplest
models of parental investment have considered the household as a single decisionmaking unit, more complex models of parental investment have considered the
parent-offspring relationship as a bargaining process, with the possibilities of
intergenerational cooperation or conflict, communication or deception (Trivers,
1974; Maynard-Smith, 1977).
There are several corollaries to the utility-maximization model that have
non-trivial implications for competing siblings. Children of different ages may
benefit from different kinds of parental input; younger children are often perceived
as benefiting the most from direct parental contact. In general, if parental time
investments are guided by milestones which are eventually within reach for most
5

children (for example: "I will return to work when my child is sleeping through the
night"), then the "mature" child who achieves a milestone more quickly may
receive fewer time resources (for example, a shorter maternity leave) because the
target for parental investment has been reached sooner. This is not the only
possible parental strategy; under other circumstances (for example, under
conditions of very high variation in possible child outcome) parents might prefer to
invest in the children who are most likely to do well. (Hanushek, 1992;
Rosenzweig & Wolpin, 1988; Becker and Tomes, 1976).

Design of the present study:
The sample for the present study is drawn from the 1994 wave of the 1979
National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. The NLSY79 began as a sample of young
men and women who were between the ages of 14 and 21 in 1979, with an
oversampling of black, hispanic, and low-income white subjects. Since 1982, the
survey has collected systematic information about the children of female subjects,
including pregnancy and birth history, mother's work status coded quarterly from
12 months before the child's birth to five years after birth, and the exact dates of
stopping and starting work (if any) before and after the child's birth. At the time of
this study, the 1994 wave of interviews were the most recent available. Extensive
descriptions and documentation of the NLSY are available (Center for Human
Resource Research: NLS Users' Guide, 1994).
The eligible subjects for this report consisted of all singleton infants who were
6

born after the mother's entry into the survey, and for whom we had complete
records of the birth factors and background variables selected for study. The final
sample consisted of 6603 infants born to 3785 mothers between 1980 and 1994;
mothers in the sample were between 14 and 36 years old at the time of their
children's births. Of this full sample, 5727 children (from 2782 families) had at least
one older or younger sibling also in the sample. Beginning in 1986, the NLSY has
undertaken periodic assessments of the children's cognitive and social
development; about 73% of children born after 1985 have had an initial assessment
before the age of 24 months. 1162 children, about 40% of the development
sample, were assessed before mother's entry to employment. Tables 2 and 3
present a description of the full, sibling, and development samples.

Mother's work history and return to employment:
90% of mothers in the sample had worked at some time before the child's
birth, and 87.1% of mothers were observed to have worked at some time after the
child's birth. For the purposes of the present study, we are interested in the timing
of mother's first entry to employment after the child's birth. We choose this
outcome measure because of its conceptual clarity, and because of the high quality
of the information about the timing of employment available within the NLSY.

Child factors:
Children's birth characteristics are of particular interest in the present study,
7

because they are observed before the beginning of the child's post-natal care. The
birth information available in the NLSY allows us to distinguish among four
newborn health characteristics: prematurity (based on the reported gap between
the infant's date of birth and expected due date); intrauterine growth retardation
(IUGR; based on comparisons of the child's birth weight with standards adjusted
for the child's gender, ethnicity, and gestational age); congenital defect (based on
the reported results of prenatal testing); and the child's length of hospitalization at
birth (compared to mother's length of hospitalization). Because the patterns of
prediction from birth defect, IUGR, and extended hospitalization were observed to
be very similar, these three characteristics were collapsed into a single "high risk"
category (coded 0 or 1) for the purpose of most analyses.
The Motor and Social Development Scale and the Temperament Scale of
the NLSY consist of maternal report items derived from several well-known
measures of early child development (the Bayley, Gesell, and Denver, and the
Rothbart Infant Behavior Questionaire). Norms were established using the same
instruments in the 1981 National Health Interview Survey.
The NLSY Temperament Scale contains three subscales: fearfulness,
positive affect, and what the developers have labeled "friendliness"; all three
subscales are moderately to highly correlated. Because we were interested in
examining the differential parental response to "fearfulness" vs. other negative
affect, we retained "fearfulness" as a separate scale, and combined positive affect
and "friendliness", with the necessary reverse codings, into a "difficulty" scale.
8

The development scale yields a single, age- and gender-standardized score,
with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. Both the temperament and the
development scores have been transformed in our regression models into z-scores,
with a mean of zero, and standard deviation of one.

Maternal and household background factors:
Ten other maternal and family background variables, assessed before the
child's birth, were also considered as possible predictors of maternal employment.
These study variables are summarized in Table 3, and the definitions of the
variables are presented in more detail in Appendix B. We have focused on factors
that could not, themselves, have been influenced by the infant's characteristics. As
a result, we have omitted several potentially important factors, such as the arrival
of younger siblings, mother's health after pregnancy, and father's continued
presence in the household, which may influence mother's labor force participation,
but which refer to events that occur after the child's birth.

RESULTS:
Part 1: Do birth factors predict the timing of mother's employment?:
Fifty percent of mothers in the sample had returned to work by 34 weeks;
55.5% were employed within the first year of the child's life, and 86.7% were
employed at some time in the first five years. Mothers of infants with IUGR, birth
defects, or extended hospitalizations began working at a median of 47 weeks, or
9

about 13 weeks later than the mothers of healthy infants. Unexpectedly, mothers of
premature infants began working at a median of 27 weeks, about seven weeks
earlier than the mothers of full term infants. Figure 1 presents the simple survival
curves, comparing the cumulative proportions of mothers still remaining at home
for up to 15 years after the child's birth, for full term and preterm infants, both
healthy and high risk; Figure 2 compares infants with birth defects, IUGR, and
extended hospitalizations.
Table 4 summarizes the results of several Cox proportional hazard regression
models, estimating the joint contribution of child and maternal factors in predicting
the likelihood of mother's entry into the labor force after the child's birth. The
proportional hazard regression predicts the instantaneous likelihood of mother's
entry to employment at time (t), among mothers who are not yet working at that
time. For some analyses, we also report the results of logistic regression models
(otherwise similar to the proportional hazard regressions) predicting the likelihood
of mother ever having worked within the first five years after the child's birth. In
both types of regression, for any parameter value p, an increase of one unit in the
associated factor multiplies the likelihood of employment by ep.
In Table 4, model 1 presents the parameters associated with infant birth
characteristics, considered as a group without maternal factors; model 2 adds
maternal background variables; model 3 is similar to model 2, but combines IUGR,
birth defect, and extended hospitalization into a single "high risk" category, and
model 4 includes all of the significant two-way interactions which emerged among
10

factors in model 3.
When the child health factors were considered together in model 1 of Table 4,
mothers of infants with intrauterine growth retardation and extended
hospitalizations were 15 to 21% less likely to begin working at any interval,
compared to other mothers, and mothers of healthy premature infants were 9.4%
more likely to begin working than other mothers. After controlling for mother's
pre-pregnancy employment and other factors in models 2 and 3, it appears that
mothers of high risk infants were about 13% less likely to begin working at any
interval, (and about 55% less likely to work at all in the first five years), compared
to other mothers. Mothers of healthy premature infants were about 13% more
likely to begin work at any interval, and 32% more likely to ever work in the first
five years. Figures 1 and 2 suggest that the associations with prematurity and
newborn "high risk" status persist well after children have reached school age.
As we expected, mother's past work history was by far the strongest
predictor of mother's employment after the child's birth. Mother's health status,
AFQT, ethnicity, and poverty status and receipt of public support were also
significant predictors; child "risk" status and maternal health had effects of similar
magnitude. Prematurity predicted earlier employment most strongly among
mothers with the highest and lowest AFQT scores, (see Figure 3), and infant risk
status predicted later employment more strongly among hispanic mothers (Figure
4).
Hazard regressions similar to models 3 and 4 were used to predict the
11

timing of mother's leave from work before the infant's birth. The unexpectedly
shortened maternity leave after the birth of a healthy premature infant could not be
explained as a consequence of a longer leave-from-work before birth: mothers of
premature infants not only began working earlier than other mothers, but they had
left work significantly closer to the time of delivery (risk ratio 1.09, p=.05).

Part 2: Within-family fixed effects:
An association between the child's birth characteristics and mother's
employment does not establish whether the child's characteristics are truly
"causing" mother's employment decision. For example, low income mothers are
more likely to have "high risk" infants. If mothers of high risk infants are less likely
to work that other mothers, this could reflect the effects of poverty, poor
education, and other obstacles to employment opportunity for these mothers,
regardless of the health status of the infant. As another example, premature birth
might increase the likelihood of mother's employment, perhaps by influencing the
affective relationship between mother and infant, but it is also possible that
unobserved characteristics of the mother could simultaneously increase the risk of
prematurity, and increase the likelihood of an early return to employment after the
child's birth.
We can control for many unobserved maternal background factors by
making comparisons among children in the same family. Our second analysis
considers whether within-family differences in newborn health among siblings
12

predicted within-family differences in the timing of mother's return to work after
each birth. We use a conditional logistic model to describe the timing of mother's
employment; this model takes the difference between mother's observed work
status at specific intervals after the child's birth, and the mean of that observation
at comparable intervals among all siblings within the family. Factors within the
family which would not vary from one birth to the next - factors such as mother's
own childhood and ethnic background, AFQT score and general abilities, and
personal and work experience before the birth of her first child - will drop out of
the equation. Other environmental factors - such as the child's birth order, father's
presence in the home, and mother's age, health, and most recent work status before
pregnancy - may vary across siblings; if measured, these factors are kept in the
model. There is a potential bias in the fixed-effect model if the health of one sibling
can affect the likelihood of mother's employment after the birth of other siblings.
For example, if a second sibling is born before mother has returned to work after
the birth of a first sibling, then mother's time-to-work for both children could be
influenced by the health of either child. 9.5% of sibling pairs had overlapping timeto-work intervals in the present sample; premature infants were less likely, and
high risk infants were more likely to be part of overlapping intervals. Overall, the
occurence of overlapping observations among siblings would have tended to
underestimate the effects of "high risk" status in the fixed effects model.
Table 5 compares ordinary and conditional logistic regressions, predicting
whether mother had ever begun employment by one, two, three, four and five
13

years after the child's birth. The first two rows of table 5 present the parameters
associated with prematurity and "high risk" status in ordinary logistic regression
models; child gender (which was not significant) and all maternal background
factors were also included in these models, but, for simplicity, these parameters are
not presented in the table. The third and fourth rows of the table present the
comparable conditional logistic models comparing the prediction to maternal
employment among siblings within the same family. Child gender and birth order,
father's presence, and mother's age, health status, and work hours before
pregnancy were included in these models; again, for simplicity, only prematurity
and risk status are presented.
In the fixed effects model, after the second year, we find that high risk status
remains strongly significant in the fixed-effects model, but we find that prematurity
falls away. Mothers were only about half as likely to have ever worked within five
years after the birth of a high risk infant, compared to the child's normal sibling.
Mothers of premature infants began to work earlier, but prematurity did not
predict differences in maternal employment among siblings; instead, it is as if the
mothers of premature infants were more "hurried" in returning to work after the
births of both the premature infant and the infant's fullterm siblings.

Part 3: Development and temperament:
In the next step of our analysis, we examine whether infant development
and temperament seem to predict mother's employment. These assessments were
14

available for 2841 children, including 1162 children for whom the infant
assessments happened to have taken place before mother was yet working.
Children were more likely to be in the "not yet working" subgroup if their mothers
entered employment later rather than earlier; as a result, children in this subgroup
were more likely to be high risk than children in the "already working" subgroup
(18% vs 12.75%), with lower development scores (mean 99 vs 102.5) and higher
difficulty scores (mean 6.0 vs. 5.6); their mothers were less likely to have been
working before pregnancy (41.1% vs 85.7%), more likely to be hispanic (20.6% vs
16.6%), more likely to be in poverty, (39.9% vs 15.2%), more likely to have been
on public support (34.0% vs 11.3%), and more likely to be single (28.55 vs
20.0%). Because they are a selected group, the estimates from this subsample may
not represent the experience of children in the NLSY as a whole; all the same, the
patterns of prediction in this subsample cannot be directly attributed to mother's
employment.
Figure 3 presents the simple survival curves associated with infant
development and fearful and difficult temperament. Table 6 compares a series of
hazard models predicting mother's employment as a function of infant development
and temperament. Model 1 considers the prediction from infant factors alone;
model 2 adds maternal background factors, model 3 adds all significant
interactions involving child factors, and models 4 and 5 resemble models 2 and 3,
conditional on mother's not yet having returned to work at the time of the child's
assessment.
15

In all of the models, higher development scores predicted earlier maternal
employment, and the response to perceived infant fearfulness seemed to differ from
the response to perceived infant difficulty. In general, difficult temperament
predicted a higher likelihood of maternal employment; the trend illustrated in figure
3 becomes larger in magnitude, and statistically significant, after the inclusion of
maternal background factors. Fearful temperament predicted a lower likelihood of
maternal employment, but becomes less significant after the inclusion of maternal
background. The association with the child's development score changed little in
the "not yet working" subgroup, but the associations with fearfulness and with
difficult temperament became much stronger.
There were a number of interactions observed between the child and
maternal factors. For example, models 3 and 5 reveal a complex, three-way
interaction among child gender, mother's work status before pregnancy, difficult
temperament, and the likelihood of employment after birth. Among mothers who
were not working before pregnancy, high difficulty scores were associated with a
later entry to work, especially for boys. Among mothers who did work just before
pregnancy, high difficulty scores were associated with an earlier return to work,
especially for boys. High difficulty scores were also stronger predictors of an
earlier return to work among mothers of premature infants.
The interaction between difficult temperament and mother's past work
status seemed to be specific to mother's labor force attachment, and was not
paralleled by interactions between difficult temperament and other factors related
16

to mother's general abilities or expected wage, such as age, education, AFQT
score, or ethnicity.
There were also interactions between maternal AFQT and infant fearfulness
and child gender. Mothers with the highest and lowest AFQT scores appear to be
more responsive to infant fearfulness than mothers with intermediate scores;
mothers with lower AFQT scores were more likely to stay at home with daughters,
and mothers with higher AFQT scores were more likely to stay at home with sons.
Figure 4 illustrates this interaction.

Part 5: Prediction from mother's employment to children's behavior
problems at kindergarten age:
In the last step of our analysis, we examine mother's cumulative hours of
work over the first four years as a predictor of the mother's ratings of the child's
behavior problems at kindergarten age, - not as a definitive analysis, but to
examine the degree to which such estimates might be influenced by the maternal
and child endowment factors considered in the present study.
The Behavior Problems Index (BPI) consists of 28 maternal report items;
like the infant assessments, age specific national norms for this index were
established in the 1981 National Health Interview Survey. Higher scores on the
BPI reflect more behavior problems; the sample mean score is 104, with a standard
deviation of 14.8. 1805 children in the development sample received a Behavior
Problems Index rating between 4 and 6 years of age.
17

Table 7 presents four ordinary linear regression models predicting the
child's Behavior Problem Index scores at kindergarten age. The first model in
Table 7 predicts the child's BPI score from the "employment effect" measure,
mother's average hours per week of employment over the child's first four years,
and selected maternal background measures, including mother's age, poverty
status, and the child's firstborn status. Model 2 adds maternal background factors
which are less commonly available in other data sets: mother's AFQT, mother's
health before the child's birth, and lagged employment. Model 3 adds child health,
gender, development, and fearful temperament; and model 4 adds difficult
temperament. From model 1 to model 2, the added maternal background factors
increased the estimated effect of mother's employment by about 22%, and from
model 2 to model 3, infant health, development and fearfulness scores increased
the effect by about 20%; in model 4, difficult temperament decreased the apparent
effect by about 14%. The apparent negative effect of maternal employment
remains small, but significant; for example, in the final model, forty hours work per
week over the first four years of the child's life predicted an increase of 2.4 points
in the child's behavior problem score at kindergarten age, compared to children
whose mothers did not work. The employment-effect estimate appears to be about
equally sensitive to the maternal and infant factors which are included in the model.

DISCUSSION:
Mothers were 55% less likely to have worked in the first five years after
18

the birth of a "high risk" infant. Mothers of healthy premature infants were about
33% more likely to have worked, mothers of more difficult infants were about
23% more likely to have worked, and mothers of infants with lower development
scores were about 19% less likely to have worked in the first five years.
Can we conclude that common variations in child health, temperament, or
development truly "cause" differences in mother's labor force participation? On the
one hand, it seems plausible that parents may adapt to individual differences among
children, and the apparent large effects of newborn "high risk" status remained
significant in the comparisons among siblings. On the other hand, the association
with prematurity disappeared in the fixed-effects model, and the sample was too
small to test a sibling model for development and temperament. Some of these
child endowments may have directly influenced mother's employment; others (for
example, prematurity) probably did not. All the same, the design of the present
study does establish that children in daycare may differ from other children, well
before their entry into daycare.
The selection effects reported here closely match the pattern of child
characteristics which have been interpreted as daycare or employment outcomes in
previous studies. In the present study, mothers of high risk and developmentally
delayed infants were slower to return to employment; it is possible that the
cognitive benefits of maternal employment may have been overstated. The mothers
of more "difficult" infants usually began working earlier than other mothers; the
behavioral hazards of maternal employment may also have been overstated.
19

Mothers of difficult boys returned to work earlier than mothers of difficult girls,
and mothers with lower AFQT scores were more likely to work if the child was a
boy; preexisting differences in maternal ability and infant temperament may explain
some reported gender differences in daycare outcome (Rutter, 1981;
Bronfenbrenner et al, 1984; Gamble and Zigler, 1986; Goldsmith and Alansky,
1987; Hoffman, 1989, Desai et al, 1989, and NICHD, 1997.)
The interactions among difficult temperament, child gender, and mother's
previous work status can be summarized by stating that mothers of difficult infants,
especially difficult boys, were most likely to resume their previous employment
status after the child's birth: mothers who were working before pregnancy,
returned to work sooner, and mothers who were at home before pregnancy,
remained at home longer. This interaction was not explained by any interactions
between child temperament and other factors (such as maternal age, ethnicity,
education, or AFQT score) that are also associated with employment. Thus, it
seems that difficult infant temperament has a direct effect on the costs or benefits
of maternal role change itself. For example, the stress of caring for a difficult infant
could cause a mother to place a higher value on her existing social supports; if she
has been working, these supports may be in the workplace, and if she has been at
home, these supports may be near home. Whatever the underlying process, recent
studies have suggested that for mothers who do seek respite from the care of a
"difficult" infant, the respite may have a protective effect for the parent-child
relationship (Egeland and Hiester, 1995).
20

Maternal or child selection effects could reconcile several conflicting or
"paradoxical" results in the existing daycare literature. Lamb, Sternberg, and
Prodromidis (1992), in a comprehensive metaanalysis of daycare-related
attachment studies published up to that date, found that toddlers in part-time
daycare were 6.7 times more likely to be rated as insecure than children in full-time
daycare, and Baydar and Brooks-Gunn (1991) find that children in part-time
daycare have lower vocabulary scores at four years than children in full-time home
care or full-time daycare. If the care of difficult infants were more likely to be
divided among multiple caregivers, or if mother's hours per week of employment
were affected by factors that differed from those affecting her decision to enter the
labor force, then children in part-time care could be more vulnerable, before their
entry into daycare, than children in either home care or full-time daycare.
In practice, how important do the observed effects appear to be? From the
point of view of the high risk infant, the effects are large: mothers were half as
likely to have worked within five years after the birth of a high risk infant, and
mothers of infants with high difficulty scores were a third more likely to have
worked in the first five years. From an economic standpoint, the observed effects
may also be significant. Low income infants have higher rates of health problems;
we found that 20% of low-income children were classified as "high risk" in the
present study. This 20% prevalence predicts a 10% lower rate of labor force
participation among low-income mothers than would otherwise have been
observed.
21

Table 7 suggests that estimates of the behavioral effects of daycare may be
sensitive to the exact child and maternal factors considered in the estimation
model. The magnitude of the estimate was increased by up to 20% by the inclusion
of our child variables; this was similar to the estimate's sensitivity to the inclusion
of maternal health, AFQT, and past employment. Taken together, the child
variables (including difficult temperament) increased the magnitude of the estimate
by less than 4%, but the final model in Table 7 predicted only 11% of the variance
in the child's BPI score, and a regression model using all of our child and maternal
variables explained less than one third of the variance in mother's cumulative hours
employed by four years. Other child outcomes - for example, security of
attachment - may be affected to different degrees by preexisting differences among
mothers and children. Other child measures - for example, more refined
assessments of newborn neurodevelopmental status and health, and other measures
of infant development, physical maturity, and physical and social attractiveness may prove to be stronger predictors of parental behavior.

Policy Implications:
The evidence reported here may have implications for family leave policy,
welfare reform and social security reform, as well as for the interpretation of the
existing maternal employment, preschool education and daycare literatures.
Mothers do seem to be influenced by their children's health and wellbeing, and
these influences seem to go beyond the effects of childhood "disability", as usually
22

defined. The current cutbacks in income support for low-income families may
significantly affect the elasticity of mother's labor supply in response to child
vulnerability. If the parental choices observed in the present study do tend to
benefit children, then withdrawal of public support for low-income mothers may
harm those children who face the greatest developmental hazards.
The evidence reported here also supports the use of experimental study
designs (or the use of instrumental variable techniques) to assess the impact of
important policy interventions on the family. The determinants of maternal
employment are still poorly understood; observational studies (such as the NLSY)
are likely to be able to "control" for only a small portion of the factors which may
influence the interactions between parents and children.

Conclusions:
Newborn health, infant development and infant temperament predict
mother's labor force participation. Mothers of "small for dates" and other high risk
infants are only about half as likely to be employed in the first five years, and
mothers of premature infants, mothers of infants with higher development scores,
and mothers of infants perceived as having more difficult temperament are 20-33%
more likely to be employed in the first five years, compared to mothers of other
children. It appears likely that child health and wellbeing do influence mother's
labor force participation, but whether or not we have measured the most important
child factors influencing mother's employment, and whether or not this association
23

represents a causal relationship, our results suggest that the children of employed
mothers may differ significantly from other children, well before their entry into
daycare. This observation may have policy implications for AFDC and children's
social security reform, and should be considered as an alternative explanation for
many apparent daycare outcome effects.

APPENDIX A: Definitions of newborn health variables
Although prematurity and intrauterine growth retardation are often
considered together, as components of "low birthweight", the causes and
developmental consequences of the two factors may be different (Cogswell and
Yip, 1995). Premature infants are at higher risk of neurological and other
complications in the early newborn period, but those premature infants who
survive the perinatal period without complications seem to have few long term
developmental problems. In contrast, both full term and preterm infants with
intrauterine growth retardation or perinatal complications appear to be at long
term risk for learning disabilities, disruptive behavior disorders, and attention
deficit disorder ( Walther, 1988; Villar et al, 1984; Hadders-Algra and Touwen,
1990; and McCarton et al, 1996). Prematurity and intrauterine growth retardation
are considered separately in the present study.

Prematurity:
In general, gestational age is measured less accurately than birth weight. The
gestational ages in the NLSY are calculated from a question asking how many
weeks early or late the child was born, compared to the child's expected due date;
this number was then added to or subtracted from 39 weeks. This method seems to
have resulted in some "heaping", with too few births reported at 38 and 40 weeks,
and too many at 39 weeks, but the distribution of gestational ages before 38 weeks
and after 40 weeks seems to be otherwise similar to the distribution reported in US
38

national vital statistics. (US Vital Statistics, 1990).
We have used a conventional cutoff of 37 weeks' gestation to define
prematurity; 11.6% of children in the present sample were reported to have been
born earlier than 37 weeks; 10.6% of all births were reported to occur before 37
weeks in the United States in 1990. The results presented were qualitatively
unchanged by the use of a continuous measure, or by the use of other cutoffs,
ranging from 32 to 36 weeks.

Intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR):
Infants with IUGR represented 54% of the low birth-weight infants in the
present sample. In general, infants with IUGR have higher rates of perinatal
morbidity and mortality than normal weight infants of comparable gestational ages;
IUGR infants appear to be at higher risk for minor neurological dysfunction,
cognitive delays and behavioral problems, compared to normal weight infants
(Villar et al, 1984; Hadders-Algra and Touwen, 1990; McCarton et al, 1996).
For the purposes of this report, infants were classified as having
intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) if they fell below a standard criterion of
weight for gestational age, categorized separately for boys and girls, and for black
versus other infants (Hoffman et al, 1974). About 5.8% of infants in the sample
were classified as IUGR. The "heaping" of gestational age at 39 weeks in the
NLSY has probably introduced some error in the classification of infant nutritional
status, with some infants actually born at 38 weeks being overclassified as IUGR,
39

and some infants actually born at 40 weeks being underclassified; nevertheless, the
overall proportion of IUGR appears to be comparable to the rates reported in
other recent studies. As with prematurity, other criteria (including the simple use
of birthweight) yielded qualitatively similar results. A SAS program to calculate
IUGR status using the Hoffman tables is available from the author.

Birth Defect:
Until 1991, mothers in the NLSY were asked whether they had had a
sonogram or amniocentesis during pregnancy, and, if so, they were asked for the
results of the test. 104 infants in the sample (1.6%) were given a prenatal
diagnosis of "birth defect" from one of these tests; 18 of these infants were
eventually born prematurely and 86 were born at term. This category may not
capture all of the infants in the sample with congenital anomalies: the question was
not asked after the 1990 survey, and the question does not include infants whose
diagnosis was made at the time of birth or later. The pattern of results presented
here remains unchanged if we consider only children born before 1991.

Extended hospitalization at birth:
Complications of birth and a wide range of other prenatal or perinatal
health problems may also carry long term risks for cognitive and behavioral
problems (McCarton 1996).
40

The length of the child's hospitalization at birth is a non-specific measure
reflecting both the infant's health status and, of course, current health care
practices. We control for differences in the average length of stay for a normal
delivery, and for infants who are boarded for extra days because of the
requirements of mother's recovery, by comparing the child's length of stay in the
hospital with mother's length of stay. Newborns were categorized as having
"extended hospitalization" if the child stayed in the hospital longer than mother, or
for more than seven days.
By this definition, 11% of infants in the sample, representing 38.3% of
premature infants, 29.4% of IUGR infants, 16.4% of infants with birth defects, and
6.9% of full term and normal weight infants, had extended hospitalizations. Again,
results were qualitatively unchanged by using other cutoffs, or by using a
continuous rather than a categorical measure.

APPENDIX B:
Maternal background factors:
Ten maternal background factors were included in the labor supply models present
here. All factors refer to information collected before the child's birth.
The strongest predictor of mother's return to employment after the child's
birth was mother's history of past employment. As indicators of mother's
attachment to the labor force, we use mother's hours per week of employment in
the fourth quarter (9 to 12 months) before the child's birth, ("hours/week before
41

pregnancy"), and the log of the time since mother has last been employed, if she
was not working in the fourth quarter before the child's birth ("log weeks since last
worked before pregnancy"). Employment in the fourth quarter before birth
represents employment observed just before conception; it is the most recent
observation of mother's employment prior to the possible effects of the pregnancy
itself.
We also include several other conventional factors predicting mother's
expected wage, (mother's AFQT, black and hispanic ethnicity, age, and mother's
health status before pregnancy), the existing demand for mother's household
production (the child's birth order), and the availability of other sources of income
or support (whether the household fell below federal poverty status level in the
year before the child's birth; spouse or partner's presence in the home; and the
family's receipt of AFDC, SSI, or food stamps in the year before the child's birth).
Although maternal employment rates in the United States were increasing
throughout the period of the survey, the child's year of birth, and the local
unemployment rate in the year of the child's birth, were not significant predictors
of the timing of mother's employment in the present study, and were omitted from
the final models.
"Mother's health" refers to mother's self-reported health status in the most
recent interview before the child's birth; the variable is recorded as 1 if mother
reported having a health condition that would limit her ability to work, the type of
work she was able to do, or the hours per week that she would be able to work. If
42

mother reported no health problem, or if the only health condition mentioned was
pregnancy, the variable was recorded as zero. Two other possible maternal health
factors (cesarean section delivery, and length of mother's hospitalization at birth)
did not directly predict mother's employment, and were not included in the
analysis.
The Armed Forces Qualifications Test (AFQT) is a measure of verbal
aptitude, derived from mother's Profile scores on the Armed Services Vocational
Aptitude Battery, administered to all NLSY respondents in 1980. Although the
AFQT score is influenced by educational exposure, age at testing, and language
background, and should not be thought of as an unbiased measure of "true
intelligence", the AFQT has been found to be a powerful predictor of later
educational attainment, wages, and income; mother's AFQT is also a powerful
predictor of the child's cognitive development (eg, Hill and O'Neill, 1994).
The AFQT score is represented in the regression models as a z-score, with a
mean of zero and a standard deviation of one; a quadratic relationship between
AFQT score and maternal employment is represented by squaring the standardized
score.
