Commodity Trade Matters

NBER Working Paper No. 24965

JEL No. F10,O13
ABSTRACT
Primary commodities are used as inputs into all production processes, yet they account for
approximately 16 percent of world trade. Despite their share in trade, we show that the aggregate
gains from trade are largely understated if we ignore key features of commodities: low price
elasticities of demand (difficulty in finding substitutes), low price elasticities of supply, and high
dispersion of natural resources across countries. We develop a general-equilibrium model of
consumption, production, and input-output linkages that explicitly accounts for these features.
Our simulations confirm that the gains from trade are significantly larger, especially when
considering large trade cost changes.

Introduction

A continued concern associated with globalization is the access of countries to critical commodities in the world market. Pressing issues such as geopolitical instability combined with increased
openness and a burgeoning demand for critical minerals used in new technologies have made understanding the role of international commodity trade even more important today. Quantifying the
interdependency of nations on trade in natural resources has crucial implications for international
relationships, such as the risk countries face due to instability in access to global markets, as well
as how much countries would lose by imposing barriers to trade, such as the creation of tariffs on
imported commodities or by cutting off a key trading partner.
Despite recognition among academics of the importance of international trade, several recent
papers have found that the welfare gains from international trade are modest: using a formula proposed by Arkolakis et al. (2012) that applies to a wide range of models, estimates of the gains from
trade equal 1.4% of GDP for the US in 2000.1 These models, however, make stark assumptions
that do not fit stylized facts about most primary commodities. Commodities are characterized by
several traits, which include: low responsiveness of both demand and supply to changes in price,
reliance on natural resources, and a high concentration of these natural resources among only a
few countries (e.g. Chile for copper, South Africa for platinum, Congo for cobalt). As shown in
previous work (see Gilbert 2010, Wright 2011), these features can explain the high volatility of the
price of these commodities. But little research has yet been undertaken to examine the implications
of these features for the quantification of the gains from trade.
The idea motivating this paper can be simply illustrated using a textbook two-commodity diagram for the gains from trade, as shown in Figure 1. Conditional on the same values of observed
production E and consumption C, the gains from trade depend upon the shapes of the isoquant2
and the production possibility frontier (PPF). In the left panel (a), demand and production can adjust flexibly to changes in relative prices, whereas in the right panel (b), both the isoquant and PPF
are more convex (inelastic). We argue that trade with commodities corresponds to the case of inelastic supply and demand, where the gains from trade are the largest. Furthermore, as commodity
production tends to be concentrated among few countries, this leads to larger differences between
demand C and production E, and thus larger implied gains from trade.
We embed such channels and quantify the gains from trade in an otherwise standard model
with gravity equations for international trade in each final good and primary commodity. To do so,
we proceed in three steps. First, we assemble a rich dataset on trade, production, and prices across
169 detailed commodities with which we document several stylized facts on trade in primary com1. Given an import penetration of 7% and an elasticity of trade to trade costs equal to 5.

modities. Next, we develop a general-equilibrium model of trade that accounts for these specific
features and stylized facts. Finally, we use our model and data to simulate counterfactual equilibria
with higher trade barriers and confirm that ignoring these specific features of commodities leads to
a wide understatement of the gains from trade.
In order to assess the gains from trade, an essential step is to assemble and harmonize trade and
production data at a disaggregated level.3 Current datasets of trade and production generally aggregate commodities into broad categories, such as “minerals”. This level of aggregation is not able
to account for the input-output linkages found in commodity trade. For instance, although many
countries produce mineral commodities broadly, the production of specific minerals is highly dispersed across countries. To capture this level of granularity, we use detailed data on production in
order to match the trade data available across 6-digit or 4-digit HS product categories. As there is
no readily-available dataset at a such a disaggregated level spanning many commodities, production and price data are gathered from various sources.4 We then document several stylized facts that
describe trade in commodities: the concentration of trade and income in a few commodities and
countries, the low elasticities of supply and demand from our own meta-analysis covering many
scattered sources, and the responsiveness of trade in commodities to trade barriers. These features
help justify the assumptions of our model and explain the large gains from trade in commodities.
Our model includes multiple (traded) sectors, two stages of production (final goods and commodities) and different factors of production (labor and natural resources).5 The production of

4. For downstream industries, we employ data from the World Bank and GTAP at a more aggregate level. We also
combine this with commodity use by downstream industry across finely-defined commodities.
5. In our model, “labor” refers to a factor of production that is mobile across sectors. We do not explicitly differ-

2

final goods relies on labor and commodities, while the production of commodities relies on labor
and natural resources. We depart from an otherwise standard model of trade (a multi-sector Eaton
and Kortum 2002 framework) in several ways in order to account for trade in scarce commodities. First, on the supply side, the production of commodities requires a mobile factor, labor, and
a specific factor, natural resources, with potentially low elasticities of substitution between them.
We assume that each commodity requires a given natural resource, such as copper deposits for
copper production or a certain bundle of climatic and agronomic characteristics for agricultural
products. An unequal distribution of these resources can then explain why the production of some
commodities is highly concentrated across space. Furthermore, a low elasticity of substitution between inputs combined with the presence of a fixed factor generates a low price elasticity of supply,
as typically observed for commodities. In turn, we assume that final good production requires both
labor and commodities, allowing for a potentially low elasticity of substitution in order to generate
a low price elasticity of demand for commodities. While commodities account for a small share
of total costs in downstream sectors, those commodities would be very costly to replace if their
supply was cut off.
The model can be calibrated using estimates of several key parameters such as supply, demand
and trade elasticities, as well as moments that can be observed in the data, such as production, trade
flows and input-output relationships. Our calibrated demand and supply elasticities are well below
unity, but remain conservative relative to most estimates of both short and long-run elasticities. In
a few specific cases, we provide closed-form solutions for the gains from trade to generalize Arkolakis et al. (2012) with commodity trade and highlight the role of substitution and trade elasticities,
as well as the patterns of production in the baseline equilibrium.
We consider several counterfactuals to illustrate the role that commodities play in trade. Comparing the baseline equilibrium to autarky, we find vastly larger changes in welfare compared to
models with only one factor of production or higher elasticities of substitution. For large countries
such as the United States, gains from international trade double. For the median country, gains
from trade are three times larger than in standard models. For small countries with few resources,
the gains from trade are enormous. We find that the gains from trade are much more (negatively)
correlated with market size if we account for natural resources and trade in commodities. Mobile
factors of production (workers) tend to gain more from trade than the country on aggregate, while
the gains from trade across owners of natural resources are highly heterogeneous.
These results are greatly muted if we consider higher elasticities of substitution between natural resources and labor in the production of commodities, or between commodities and labor in
downstream industries. Gains from trade are less dispersed for natural resource owners when elasticities of substitution are higher. In contrast, considering a higher (quadruple) elasticity of trade
entiate labor from capital. A distinction between labor and capital would not play an important role.

for commodities only moderately erodes the gains from trade and the distribution of the gains,
unlike the formulas in Arkolakis et al. (2012).
We also examine intermediate trade cost changes and tariffs. With commodities, the gains
from trade are highly non-linear – effects of trade cost changes are much larger as the economy
approaches autarky – but the difference with benchmark models without commodities or natural
resources is non-negligible even further away from autarky. Interestingly, tariffs generate only tiny
differences from the benchmark model given that the deadweight loss is small with low elasticities
of commodity demand and supply. Finally, we illustrate the role of critical suppliers in each
commodity by simulating the effect of cutting off from trade the top export of each commodity
on prices in other countries for that commodity. We find large effects on prices, mainly driven by
the increase in production costs due to the increase in supply from other countries (combined with
low price elasticities of supply). In particular, we examine the substantial role of China as a major
supplier of many commodities and its influence on world prices and US prices.
Literature Our paper is unique in examining the implications of the aforementioned specific
features of many primary commodities for the quantification of the gains from trade. That said, our
work draws from a large literature regarding commodities, and our model and calibration approach
is similar to a number of other recent papers aimed at quantifying the effect of trade costs and trade
policy changes on various economic outcomes.
On the theoretical side, our work relates to three subgroups of papers that examine the gains
from trade with: i) input-output links between industries (Alexander 2017, Antràs and Gortari
2017, Caliendo and Parro 2015, Costinot and Rodrı́guez-Clare 2014), ii) gains from trade with
multiple factors of production (Galle et al. 2017, Burstein et al. 2018), and iii) gains from trade
from the specialization of land and natural resources in exported products (Costinot and Donaldson 2016, Farrokhi 2018, Sotelo 2017). We depart from the literature on multi-stage production
by assuming a key role for natural resources that are unevenly allocated across countries, and difficult to substitute. These features generate much larger gains from trade than typical models with
multiple stages of production. Our approach is close to multi-factor models, although we consider
many more factors of production (natural resources are specific to each commodity) and lower
demand and supply elasticities than usually assumed for instance across different types of labor
(Galle et al. 2017, Acemoglu 2002). Perhaps closest to our work is Farrokhi (2018), who develops
a general-equilibrium model to incorporate how changes in oil production affect downstream demand and trade flows, arguing that the gains from trade in a model considering oil are larger than
more general, existing models. Our underlying mechanism is also reminiscent of Ossa (2015),
who finds absolute gains from trade that are several times larger after accounting for the heterogeneity in trade elasticities across industries. In our framework, commodities largely contribute
4

to the gains from trade because of low supply and demand elasticities, in spite of similar, or even
potentially higher, trade elasticities.6
More broadly, our paper relates to recent work examining the pecularities and importance of
agricultural commodities in trade. Gouel and Laborde (2017) show that by incorporating a lower
elasticity of demand and supply in a model of agricultural trade, the expected welfare losses due to
climate change increase, particularly harming countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. Further, Heerman
and Sheldon (2018) argue that given systematic correlation in agricultural productivities across
countries and patterns of specialization in crop production, the assumptions inherent in the standard
gravity form of trade flow patterns must be relaxed. As patterns of specialization differ widely
across the types of agricultural products and countries, such patterns present a strong argument for
a highly granular treatment of agriculture trade.7
Our calibration method draws from recent work such as Dekle et al. (2008) and Caliendo
and Parro (2015), as well as the Computational General Equilibrium (CGE) modeling literature
discussed by Hertel et al. (1992). With this approach, trade shares, production shares and key elasticities are sufficient to solve for counterfactual changes in general equilibrium, without approximations (“exact hat algebra”). For instance, Caliendo and Parro (2015) apply these techniques to
examine the effect of NAFTA on production and employment and Caron and Fally (2017) examine the effects of changes in income and consumption on CO2 emissions in a general equilibrium
framework with trade.
Finally, our work relates to a vast literature focusing on the consequences of commodity production, particularly developing countries where production is highly concentrated in only a few
products. Such consequences include sectoral shifts away from other industries towards commodity production in the wake of large resource discoveries (Corden and Neary 1982), as well
as slower observed rates of growth for resource rich countries (Sachs and Warner 1999). With a
large dependence on commodity production, commodity price shocks can play a large (potentially
adverse) role in development. Blattman et al. (2007) show that developing countries that export
commodities with higher price volatility have lower growth rates. Similarly, Drechsel and Tenreyro
(2017) show that commodity prices have been a large driver of growth for developing countries,
arguing that commodity price shocks account for about 38% of fluctuations in post-1950 growth
in Argentina. Recent work has also examined whether natural resource discoveries increase or decrease foreign direct investment across resource and nonresource sectors (Toews and Vézina 2017,
Poelhekke and Ploeg 2013).8
6. Trade elasticities used by Ossa (2015) are not significantly different between primary commodities and other
goods. Moreover, with low elasticities of supply and demand, we find that large increases in the trade elasticity have
relatively muted effects relative to standard models.
7. We examine agricultural production and trade at disaggregated level, examining specific products, rather than
simply “agriculture” or “grains”, for example.
8. Our analysis of the importance of commodity trade also relates to the literature on commodity price movements

2.1

Data and stylized facts
Data sources

We draw from a varied set of data sources for information on production, prices, trade, and inputoutput linkages across commodities. In an online appendix, we provide additional information on
the construction of our dataset, in addition to providing our data online.9
Production data. For minerals, the main source of production data is the British Geological
Survey (2015), which provides mineral production data at the country level from 1913 to 2015.
For agriculture, the main source of agricultural data is from the Food and Agriculture Organization
of the United Nations (2017) (FAO), which provides data from 1960 to 2014 on the production of
agricultural products at the country level. Supplementally, we employ production data from the
Global Trade Analysis Project, or GTAP (Aguiar et al. 2012) for downstream industries in the year
2007.
Trade data. For information on trade flows, we employ BACI data, constructed by CEPII and
based on UN-Comtrade data (Gaulier and Zignago 2010). These data are detailed at the 6-digit
level of the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (HS), of which we use the
1992 nomenclature. In order to match production and trade data, we further aggregate the trade
data to match the level of granularity in the production data. These cover the years 1995 to 2014.
Price data. We use the United States Geological Survey Historical Statistics for Mineral and
Material Commodities in the United States for prices of mineral commodities (Kelly and Matos
and commodity price booms and busts, which is reviewed by Carter et al. (2011) and Radetzki and Wårell (2017).
Williams and Wright (2005) and Cafiero et al. (2011) show that the competitive rational storage model, coupled with
a sufficiently low elasticity of demand, can rationalize the high volatility of commodity prices. Additionally, Jacks
and Stuermer (2018) decompose commodity price booms and busts from 1870-2013 and conclude that most price
shocks are driven by changes in demand, rather than supply shocks. Similarly, Gilbert (2010) argues that one of the
main reasons for price booms is the low responsiveness of agricultural production to sudden demand shocks that are
correlated across agricultural commodities.

2014). This is the most comprehensive source of yearly price data for minerals, however it does not
cover mineral prices for countries other than the US. We complement this price data with the IMF
Primary Commodity Price Series database for uranium prices (Commodities Team of the Research
Department, IMF 2017), the World Bank Commodity “Pink Sheets” for fuel petroleum and coal
prices (World Bank Group 2017), and U.S. Energy Information Association (2017) data on natural
gas prices. For agricultural products, we use producer price data from the FAO at the country level
when available, and use median world agricultural prices for commodities when country level
prices are unavailable or unrealistic (for more information, see Appendix Section 6).
Commodity end use. A few sources report figures for commodity consumption by downstream
sectors. GTAP data provide end use information between several categories of primary commodities10 and broad secondary and tertiary industrial sectors, which we use for agricultural commodities and fuel products. However, mineral commodities are more highly aggregated by the GTAP
classification (grouped into only two categories), despite their relatively complex downstream usage compared to agricultural commodities. To rectify this, we employ USGS end usage data (Barry
et al. 2015) for each mineral commodity across downstream NAICS industry codes at the 3 or 6digit level. Where possible, we match each NAICS code to the GTAP classification coding system
to determine the relative use of a given mineral by each downstream GTAP industrial sector.

2.2

Stylized facts

Before turning to the setup of our model, we document a series of stylized facts on the specific
patterns of commodity trade to motivate the key assumptions of the model and help explain the
large gains from trade in commodities.
Fact 1: Commodities account for a modest share of world trade. As a percentage of total
trade, commodities account for a modest share, approximately 16 percent of the value of world
trade in 2014 (following the BEC classification). However, this share has not been constant over
time. Figure 2 and Appendix Table 10 exhibit the trends in commodity trade both from the period
of 1962 to 1995 (panel a) and from 1995 to 2014 (panel b). We find that the share of world trade
in all commodities has experienced a decline since 1962, but has leveled off from the period of
1995 to 2014. Recently, the share of fuels has increased, making up for some of the decline of
commodities in world trade. Our study examines some directly-related intermediate products at a
slightly more processed level, e.g. we include smelted copper as well as copper ore in our baseline
calibration (see Appendix E for the list of primary commodities in our study). Including those

intermediate products, the share of commodities is about 3% higher and has the same variation
across years. Hence, the products in our study (the first three columns of Table 10) encompass
a slightly larger share of world trade, up to 20 percent of world trade in 2014 and 18 percent on
average.

Fact 2: Commodities face low supply and demand elasticities. We conduct a meta-analysis
of price elasticity estimates in the literature over the past decades. Since price elasticities matter
greatly for examining the patterns of commodity prices, production, and consumption, hundreds
of papers have estimated price or income elasticities for commodities, often with an emphasis on
price elasticities of demand.
Due to the importance of commodity elasticity estimates in a wide variety of domains, several
studies and sources have compiled reviews of elasticity estimates in the literature. Examples include Muhammad et al. (2011), who review price elasticity estimates of supply and demand for
numerous agricultural commodities, Jenkins (2011), who reviews estimates for 17 commodities
produced in Latin America (4 minerals, oil and 12 agricultural products), and Caldara et al. (2016),
who compile elasticity estimates for oil. For other commodities, especially minerals, we need to
gather elasticity estimates from scattered and diverse sources. Examples are Roberts and Schlenker
(2013) for 4 agricultural commodities, Stuermer (2017) on demand for 5 minerals over more than a
century, Gupta and Gupta (1983) for short and long run demand for cobalt, Blomberg and Hellmer
(2000) for supply and demand of aluminum, and Coyle et al. (2012) for crude oil.
We refer to Table 6 in the Appendix for the current list of papers that we have surveyed in
addition to the estimates covered in these surveys. This review is not intended to be exhaustive,

Notes: The full lists of estimates and references are provided in Appendix Table 6. The parentheses indicate the ranges
of estimates when more than one estimate is available, or when the author only offers an estimate of the range.

especially for elasticity estimates of agricultural and fuel commodities, but we have attempted
to review recent mineral elasticity estimates comprehensively, as they correspond to a smaller
literature. Further, Table 1 provides summary statistics for these elasticity estimates; in cases
where there are multiple estimates, we provide a range of elasticities.
Appendix Figures 14(a) and 14(b) plot the empirical distributions of the elasticity estimates we
have surveyed. Most estimates fall within the 0.1 and 0.5 range (in absolute value), both on the
supply side and demand side. The modal estimate for both distributions appears to be somewhat
less than 0.2 (in absolute value); assuming demand and supply elasticities of 0.4-0.6, as we do in
our simulations in Section 4, is quite conservative11 . The majority of these estimates are short to
medium-run elasticities, i.e. examining supply and demand responses within a year. Several papers
also estimate long-run elasticities for commodities (see Appendix Table 6), which leads to slightly
11. Papers such as Roberts and Schlenker (2013) have argued that “naive” estimates of supply and demand elasticities for storable commodities are biased to zero due to the role of futures prices and anticipated shifts in supply.
Still, using past yield shocks as instruments, the authors’ own estimates of supply and demand estimates for four
commodities/commodity groups are rarely larger than 0.4 in absolute value.

higher elasticities, but these figures still remain low.1213 In comparison, most estimates of the
elasticity of substitution between skilled and unskilled workers lie between 1.4 and 2 (Acemoglu
2002, Autor et al. 1998), with a few exceptions as low as 1 and as high as 4.
Fact 3: Commodity prices are volatile. As part of the consequences of low demand and supply
elasticities, the fluctuations in commodity prices can be quite large. Table 2 presents historical price
volatility of commodities, broken down by agriculture, fuels, and minerals. We measure volatility
as the standard deviation of log price changes (rather than the standard deviation of log prices, the
latter being less robust to small trends). On average, the yearly volatility of commodity prices is
around 20%. Over a longer term horizon, price fluctuations can also be large and cumulative, since
many commodities have price evolution patterns with very low mean reversion (Cashin et al. 2000,
Cohen et al. 2006). The consequences of this volatility can be large, especially for exporters and
importers for whom a commodity represents a large share of trade (see Fact 8). Further, Jacks
et al. (2011) present centuries of evidence indicating that commodity prices have long been more
volatile than the prices of manufactured goods.

Fact 4: Trade elasticities are not significantly higher for commodities. Table 3 reports the
results of our estimations of gravity equations for the products in our sample. Gravity equations
are estimated separately for each commodity with the Poisson-PML estimator, including exporter
and importer fixed effects to account for multilateral resistance terms (e.g. as in Fally 2015 among
12. For example, Stuermer (2017) estimates long run demand elasticities for 5 minerals using a data set back to 1840,
finding elasticities of around -0.2 for lead, tin, and zinc, -0.4 for copper, and -0.7 for aluminum. With the inclusion
of country fixed effects, downstream industry output, and potentially time trends, these estimates seem to correspond
closely to our parameter ηk . Similarly, Gupta and Gupta (1983) estimate long run demand for superalloyed Cobalt
(roughly the level of refinement that would be demanded by downstream industries) and finds a price elasticity of
-0.46, including downstream production controls.
13. Scott (2014) argues that static analyses of long-run supply elasticities may generate lower elasticity estimates,
although a dynamic model incorporating crop choice suggests that overall crop supply has an elasticity around 0.3.

Fally (2015). Column (2) reports averages of coefficient estimates across GTAP manufacturing industries (codes
25-42). Columns (3)-(6) report averages of coefficient estimates across gravity equations for separate commodities

many others). Table 3 column (1) is estimated using aggregate trade flows and reports the coefficient for each trade proxy and its estimated standard error. Column (2) reports the average and
standard deviation of gravity equation coefficients across GTAP manufacturing sectors (codes 2542). Columns (3) to (6) report the average of the coefficients for each trade proxy as well as the
the standard deviation of these coefficients across commodities within each broad categories (in
parentheses).
Primary commodities do not seem to have starkly higher distance elasticities than trade on
aggregate or across manufacturing sectors in GTAP. However, there is some heterogeneity in these
estimates, as shown by the standard deviations of the coefficients. Additionally, some commodities
seem to have higher distance elasticities than others, for instance trade is more elastic for fuels than
for minerals with respect to distance.
Also crucial is the elasticity of trade with respect to trade costs and tariffs, which differs from
the distance elasticity documented above (the distance coefficient is the product of the elasticity of
trade to trade costs, which we will call θ in Section 3, and the elasticity of trade costs to each of
the trade cost proxies). Several papers have estimated these elasticities for primary commodities
vs. other sectors (Arkolakis et al. 2013, Broda and Weinstein 2006, Caliendo and Parro 2015,
11

Donaldson 2018, Farrokhi 2018, Ossa 2015, Sotelo 2017, and Tombe 2015) and generally find
that trade elasticities for commodities are not larger than for other industries. For instance, Tombe
(2015) estimates that θ equals 4.63 for manufacturing and 4.06 for agriculture. Caliendo and
Parro (2015), however, find higher elasticities for mining and petroleum than most other industries,
focusing on trade in North America. In our baseline calibration, we assume that the trade elasticity
is the same across all sectors and examine the robustness of our results to this assumption by
quadrupling the trade elasticity for primary commodities only.
Fact 5: Commodities tend to be upstream and purchased by a few specific downstream sectors. In the 2007 US input-output tables, defined across 6-digit NAICS commodity and industry
categories (about 430 sectors), we find that the top purchasing industry accounts for 35% of total
purchases of a primary commodity (on average) and the top-three purchasing industries amount
to 60% of total purchases by commodity (on average across commodities). In the Global Trade
Analysis Project (GTAP) data, which are more aggregated (57 sectors), an average of 50% of each
commodity output is used by a single downstream sector. These high shares of top purchasers indicate fairly high specificity of each commodity. Furthermore, these input-output tables are much
more aggregated than our commodity data,14 which conceals specialized uses across commodities.
For instance, almost all iron ores are used in the production of steel, tungsten is used mainly in light
bulbs and as tungsten carbide to strengthen cutting and drilling tools, nickel in stainless steel and
magnets, phosphate in fertilizers, rare earth elements for electronics, crude petroleum in refineries,
cocoa beans for chocolate, coffee beans for ground coffee, etc. Such specificity rarely appears in
more aggregated industry-level input-output tables.
Commodity production also tends to be upstream relative to most other industries. This can be
shown by examining the “upstreamness” index documented in Fally (2012), Antràs et al. (2012)
and Fally and Hillberry (2018). In US input-output tables (Fally 2012), primary commodities
other than fuels are associated with an upstreamness index of 3.01 (and 3.48 for fuels), while the
same index is equal to 2.11 or less for manufacturing and services, indicating that commodities are
separated on average by one more production stage from final demand.
Fact 6: Commodities are intensive in natural resources. Intuitively, sales of commodities are
the main source of income associated with natural resources. Conversely, the production of primary
commodities is intensive in natural resources. According to GTAP version 8 data, the returns to
natural resources account for 31% of the costs of production across primary commodities. As
depicted in Table 4, natural resource intensities vary largely across types of commodities and less
14. For instance, “Iron, gold, silver, and other metal ore mining” and “other minerals” (omn) constitute only one
category in the US input-output tables and GTAP tables respectively.

across countries – in a simple regression with country and industry fixed effects, industry variation
accounts for half of the variance while country variation accounts for 11% of the variance.
Fact 7: For many countries, commodities and natural resources account for a large share of
their income. Table 5 shows the countries in our sample15 for which natural resources constitute
more than 25% of GDP, where natural resources are defined as rents from agriculture, forestry,
minerals, and fuels. Most countries where natural resources compose a high share of GDP are
developing countries, indicating that production and trade of products that use natural resources
may be more important to developing countries than developed countries, which tend to have a
comparative advantage in secondary and tertiary sectors.
Fact 8: For many countries, a few commodities account for a large share of their total exports
and GDP. Defined at a similar level of aggregation as production data (a bit fewer than 170
primary commodities among thousands of traded products), one or only a handful of commodities
account for majority of total exports for many countries. In Table 6 we list the countries in our
sample for which one product constitutes more than 40% of that country’s exports. Although it
seems intuitive that this may be the case for smaller countries, this phenomenon is also the case in
many large countries, especially low-income countries. Our sample encompasses only countries
with a population of more than 1 million, but despite their size (e.g. Venezuela) exports in a single
commodity make up more than 50% of exports for several of them. Several other countries have the
majority of their exports consisting in only three primary commodities, such as Angola. Petroleum
is a commodity in which many countries specialize, but other commodities may also account for
very large export shares, such as cashew nuts for Guinea-Bissau and uranium for Eritrea.
This fact relates to Easterly and Reshef (2010) and Hanson et al. (2015) for overall exports.
Such specialization leaves exporters especially vulnerable to price fluctuations in commodity prices,
15. We focus on countries with a population larger than 1 million.

which are common (see Table 2). For many developing countries, such price fluctuations in commodities can account for lower growth rates (Blattman et al. 2007, Drechsel and Tenreyro 2017).
But these extreme specialization patterns also shed light on the large gains from trade that we find
in our calibration. International trade creates a much larger relative demand in commodities than
would be sustainable domestically in these highly-specialized countries.
Fact 9: For many commodities, a few countries account for most of the world’s supply. The
converse of Fact 8 is that there are numerous commodities for which a limited number of producers
account for most of the world’s supply. An example is copper, for which Chile accounts for 37% of
world primary ore production, making it the world’s largest producer. However, many commodities
are even more geographically concentrated in terms of production than copper, including many
agricultural products (canary seeds, almonds, garlic, etc.) and mineral products (rare earth metals,
antimony, platinum, etc). As seen in Appendix Table 6, for many commodities, one producer
accounts for more than 50% of production. Overall, in 2012, 39.5% of the production of primary
commodities in our sample came from countries responsible for the production of 50 percent or
more of the world market.16
Notably, we also find a high degree of concentration in imports of many products, as shown in
Table 11 in the Appendix. The results here are intuitive, as the main importers of some of these
commodities tend to be the largest manufacturers (China, US, Japan). In addition, many of these
commodities represent inputs into the production processes of downstream industries which may
16. Similarly, the same table documents the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) on production of commodities
across countries. We find that 81 commodities in our sample have HHI’s above 0.25 in 2007, indicating a high
concentration of production in few countries.

also be geographically concentrated in a few countries (e.g. cotton for Chinese textiles).
In some cases, these concentration patterns can be partially explained by the spatial allocation of natural resources necessary to produce these commodities. Although known deposits of
minerals and fuels can expand with additional effort, exploration costs, and new technology, fundamentally, these resources are highly dispersed across countries. While this dispersion may seem
limited to minerals and fuels, the land suitable for various agricultural commodities has a similar
degree of dispersion across the world (see Appendix Figure 15 for plots of crop suitability for agricultural commodities with the highest worldwide total production value from 1970-2014). Even
with high agricultural input levels, Global Agro-Ecological Zone (GAEZ) data from FAO/IIASA
(2010) suggest that many countries are naturally unsuitable for staple agricultural commodities that
represent a large share of agricultural production. Although use of technology and labor, such as irrigation, allows production to occur outside of areas highly suitable for agricultural production of a
given product, it can only be done at a low productivity. Indeed, we find that production of agricultural commodities occurs largely within countries with land classified as suitable for agricultural
production by the GAEZ data (see Appendix Figure 17 for plots of production of commodities by
country for comparison).17
17. This relationship is not mechanical, as noted by Costinot and Donaldson (2012): the “parameters that enter
the GAEZ model are estimated from countless field and lab experiments, not from statistical relationships between
observed country-level output data and natural inputs”.

Theoretical framework

The model closely follows standard multi-sector models of trade (Costinot and Rodrı́guez-Clare
2014, Caliendo and Parro 2015) featuring gravity-type equations for trade within each sector and
inter-industry linkages. The main difference is that we emphasize the role of primary commodities
and adapt the model to account for key features of primary commodity trade described in the
previous section.
First, instead of assuming Cobb Douglas production functions, we allow for lower elasticities
of substitution in production functions across different production stages in order to generate low
demand and supply elasticities for commodities. Second, we introduce specific factors used to
produce each commodity. This also contributes to lower supply elasticities and rationalizes the
high concentration of commodity supply among a few exporters.18
We first present the general framework (Section 2.1). Then we introduce the “exact hat algebra” used to describe counterfactual equilibria and simulate the effect of a change in trade costs
(Section 3.2). Next, we move on to describe the gains from trade relative to autarky and examine
special cases where we can provide closed-form solutions for the gains from trade (Section 2.3).
18. We obtain Figure 1 in the introduction if we reduce the model to two commodities and one final good.

16

3.1

Setting and equilibrium conditions

There are potentially many countries, indexed by n or i. There are two types of goods: final goods k
(downstream industries) and commodities g (upstream). Production of final goods k relies on labor
and primary commodities g. In turn, the production function of commodities is a constant elasticity
of substitution (CES) combination between natural resources and labor. Production features constant returns to scale under perfect competition in all sectors of the economy. Both commodities g
and final goods k can be traded.
Demand for final goods We assume that utility has constant elasticity of substitution across final
goods k, with elasticity σ. Expenditure in final good k in destination n, denoted by DFnk , is:
F
DFnk = (Pnk
/PnF )1−σ ank En

(1)

where En refers to total expenditures in country n, ank is a good-by-country-specific utility shifter,
and where the overall consumer price index PnF is defined as:
#

"
PnF =

∑ ank (PnkF )1−σ

1
1−σ

(2)

k

Note that, in turn, we could model each final good sector k as the aggregation of a continuum
of product varieties with a CES sub-utility function involving an elasticity of substitution that
may differ from σ. Following Eaton and Kortum (2002), Costinot et al. (2011), Caliendo and
Parro (2015) among others, one could assume that the consumption bundle in industry k is a CES
 ξk

ξk −1

R1
aggregate of a continuum of varieties ωk ∈ (0, 1) such that: Qnk = ωk =0 qnk (ωk ) ξk dωk
with elasticities ξk . Such elasticities ξk may be allowed to differ across sectors k (and even across
countries) but they would play no role here and would not alter the counterfactuals equilibrium
conditions described in the next sections. On the contrary, the elasticity of substitution σ across
broad types of goods can potentially play an important role.
Trade in final goods k As common in the trade literature, we assume iceberg transport costs
τnik ≥ 1 from country i to country n in sector k. We denote by CikF the cost of producing goods k in
country i, such that the cost of supplying these goods in destination n is given by τnikCikF once we
adjust for trade costs.
We then assume that trade follows the typical “gravity” equation within each sector. In brief,

17

we assume that trade in final goods k, from i to n is given by:
F
Xnik
=

(CikF τnik )−θk
DFnk ≡ λnik DFnk
∑ j (CFjk τn jk )−θk

(3)

where θk denotes the elasticity of trade to trade costs. In this framework, the price index of goods k
in destination country n is then a CES function of the cost of producing these goods across source
countries i:

"
F
Pnk

∑(CikF τnik )−θk

i

Such outcomes for trade flows and price indexes (“gravity equations”) can be micro-founded and
obtained under various alternative sets of assumptions: i) under perfect competition and perfect
substitution with a continuum of varieties (Eaton and Kortum 2002 and related literature), ii) under
perfect competition and imperfect substitution across source countries (Anderson 1979) as in the
CGE literature; iii) under imperfect competition with homogeneous productivity (Krugman 1980)
or heterogeneous productivity (Chaney 2008).
For instance, following Eaton and Kortum (2002), Costinot et al. (2011), Caliendo and Parro
(2015), one could assume that there is a continuum of varieties ωk with random productivity draw
Zik (ωk ) and perfect competition such that the price would equal:
τnikCikF
pnk (ωk ) = min
i
Zik (ωk )




in each destination country n, after taking the minimum across the costs of production and shipment
across source countries i. If we further assume that productivity Zik (ωk ) is drawn independently


across countries i and sectors k from a Frechet distribution: Fik (z) = exp −(z/zik )−θk , we obtain
exactly the same equilibrium conditions as those described above and the same counterfactual
conditions as in the following sections.
Multi-sector extensions of Anderson (1979), Krugman (1980) and Chaney (2008) would also
provide frameworks that would yield the same equilibrium conditions as those described above,
i.e. lead to gravity equations within sectors, with price indexes satisfying (4). See Arkolakis
et al. (2012), Costinot and Rodrı́guez-Clare (2014) and Anderson (2011) for discussion of the
equivalence between these models.
Production of final goods k For each good k, we assume constant elasticity production functions with constant returns to scale and elasticity of substitution ηk between inputs. As discussed
previously, we assume that sector k relies on labor and a set of commodities g ∈ G(k). Thus, de-

18

noting labor wages by wi and the price of commodity g by PigC , the cost of producing final good k
in producing country i can be written as:

This cost function allows for productivity terms AFik as well as factor requirements βik,L

technology. We will denote by ϕik,L and ϕik,g the share of labor and commodity g in total costs.
Under these assumptions, Shephard’s Lemma yields the following expenditures (demand) in
commodity g in destination i by industry k:
F
DCigk = βik,g
(PigC /CikF )1−ηk YikF

F denotes production value of good k in i. We obtain total demand DC for

commodity g by summing across downstream industries: Dig = ∑k Digk .
Assuming that a given commodity g corresponds to a small share of total costs of downstream
industries k, and holding Yik and wages wi constant, the price elasticity of demand in commodity g
is approximately given by ηk :
∂ log(DCigk /PigC )
≈ −ηk
∂ log PigC

We will subsequently use this property to calibrate ηk and account for the low demand elasticities
facing most primary commodities (see Section 3).
Trade in commodities g For primary commodities, we adopt the same assumptions for trade as
for final goods k, although we allow trade costs τnig and trade elasticities θg to differ from those
associated with final goods k. We assume that trade for commodity g from i to n is given by:

Production of commodities g In turn, the cost of producing commodities is again a CES function of factor prices. We assume that the production of a commodity g in country i uses two inputs:
labor and natural resources that are specific to commodity g, such as minerals or oil reserves, with
an elasticity of substitution ρg between them.19 If we denote by rig the price of natural resources
for commodity g, the cost of producing commodity g is:

Two features of this cost equation can influence the supply elasticity of commodity g: i) assuming
that the supply of natural resources is fixed, a higher share of natural resources in total costs leads
to a lower elasticity of supply; ii) a lower elasticity of substitution ρg between labor and natural
resources also lead to a lower elasticity of supply. Holding wages and natural resources fixed, the
price elasticity of supply is:

where ϕig,R and ϕig,L = 1 − ϕig,R denote the share of natural resources and labor in the total production cost of commodity g.
Sources of income Since there are two types of factors of production, labor (mobile across industries) and natural resources (specific to each commodity), there are also two types of income
sources.
Income from natural resources associated with commodity g is Rig rig , where Rig is the (fixed)
endowment in natural resources. In equilibrium, it equals the value of production of commodity g
in country i multiplied by the share of natural resources in the production costs of this commodity:

19. Although mineral resources are certainly in finite supply, extracting costs increase with the required supply of
the commodity. Here the convexity in costs is generated by the use of another input that is mobile (labor), which has
to increase in order to produce larger amounts of that commodity. We refer to that common input as labor, but one
could think of it as additional machines and technologies required to extract larger amounts from natural resources.

Counterfactual equilibria
Exact hat algebra

Assuming that the world economy is in equilibrium, we are primarily interested in how a change
in trade costs and other key parameters will affect the equilibrium and how it will affect welfare
across countries, i.e. the ratio of income to final goods prices En /PnF .
As in Dekle et al. (2008) and Caliendo and Parro (2015) among many others, the model lends
itself naturally to counterfactual simulations in general equilibrium. By rewriting the above equilibrium conditions in terms of changes relative to the baseline observed equilibrium, the problem
can be formulated as a function of a set of observed variables and only a few parameters to estimate. We do so with the help of the “exact hat” notation, without involving approximations, where
Zb = Z 0 /Z denotes the relative change, and Z 0 refers to the value in the new equilibrium.

These equations are formulated in terms of the key elasticities of the model: σ, ηk , ρg , θk and
θg , as well as observable outcomes that describe the initial equilibrium: the share of labor and
r V
resources in g in total income in the baseline equilibrium, enL = wEn Ln n and eng = ngEnng respectively;
the expenditure share of good k in the baseline equilibrium, αnk ; the share of industry k in total
demand for commodity g in each country i, dikg ; import shares, λFnik and λCnig (equations 3 and 7);
the share of labor in manufacturing costs ϕik,L and the share of commodity g in manufacturing
costs, ϕik,g ; the share of labor and resources in the production costs of commodity g: ϕig,R and
ϕig,L . These shares can be directly observed in the data and they are easier to calibrate than the
model primitives that enter equilibrium equations (1) to (13). Note that we can ignore one of the
equilibrium conditions above for a reference country (Walras Law) and make one normalization if
the above shares are consistent with equilibrium (see Appendix).
3.2.2

Gains from trade

One can further link the gains from trade to changes in key equilibrium outcomes. With constant
elasticities of substitution, one can relate the change in prices to the cost of a specific input or good,
adjusting for the change in the share of that input or good. This can be applied to price indexes
(Feenstra 1994), gains from trade (Arkolakis et al. 2012), production costs (Blaum et al. 2015), or
other features. In our framework, this insight can be applied to several equilibrium outcomes. For
the gains from trade in a particular industry k or commodity g (as in Arkolakis et al. (2012)), we

where ŵi is normalized to unity. As a first-order approximation, the upper-level elasticity σ does
not play an important role. However, this expression suggests that elasticities of substitution ηk
can greatly influence the gains from trade in commodities, with larger gains from trade when ηk is
smaller, conditional on the change in a commodity cost share.
For factors g, we can link welfare gains from trade to the change in input shares of commodity
g and resources g. Using the tools described above, we obtain the following change in revenues
for natural resources g (relative to labor), which holds for any industry k with a positive demand
for that commodity:

Comparison to autarky

Of particular interest are the gains from trade relative to complete autarky. In some special cases,
we can obtain analytical expressions for the gains from trade, which we discuss below.
Some of the above equations describing the changes from baseline equilibrium to autarky can
be simplified in this case. Trade costs are now such that τc
nig = +∞ whenever n 6= i.
nik = +∞ and τc

Closed-form solutions when demand and supply elasticities are equal
Resource income First, when supply and demand elasticities are equal, ρg = ηk ≡ η, one can
express the change in revenues from natural resources as a function of the change in production
and costs in downstream industries:

and thus the change in income, using equation (14). In this expression, one can see that autarky
leads to larger income rig if initial demand exceeds production and if the product is purchased by
downstream industries with the highest cost increases CikF by switching to autarky. The change in
revenues is also magnified when the elasticity η is smaller (as it is the case with most commodities,
see Fact 2).

Using equation (23), C

modity g and downstream industry k, which greatly reduces the dimensionality of the problem.
Gains from trade We obtain a model with analytical solutions for the gains from trade if, in
addition to the equality between supply and demand elasticities in commodity markets, we also
assume that these elasticities are equal to the consumption elasticity of substitution between broad
groups of final goods k, i.e. assuming ρg = ηk = σ across all industries k and commodities g. The
main source of tractability in this special case is that the changes in price indexes due to the changes
in natural resources revenues r̂ig are proportional to eiL , the share of revenues in total income.20
cF 1−σ = 1/Λ1−σ . See Appendix for details.

This expression highlights the role of relative supply and demand for commodity g in the initial
equilibrium, as well as commodity-industry linkages and the relative supply and demand in downstream industries k. Again, these changes are magnified when elasticity σ is small.
We can also obtain analytical expressions for the changes in price indexes and overall GDP, as
well as the aggregate gains from trade.

if we assume that ρg = ηk = σ, where Λi is defined as above (equation 34).
In this expression, Λi corresponds to the gains from trade if labor is the only input in the production of primary commodities (no natural resources). The absence of a role for natural resources
greatly reduces the gains from trade since the production of a required commodity is no longer
tied to a country’s endowment in natural resources. In general, we obtain that the gains from trade
are larger than without natural resources, as we will illustrate quantitatively in our counterfactual
simulations.
We can further compute the gains from trade for workers and for natural resource owners
separately. For workers, whose wages are normalized (wbi = 1), the gains from trade are given by
how much the price index would increase in autarky relative to the baseline equilibrium:

In the Appendix, we describe two special cases where the formula is more simple: with a
single downstream industry (to be used when input-output linkage data are not available) and with
homogeneous commodities (limit case with infinite trade elasticities θg = +∞).

3.4
3.4.1

Two alternative model specifications
Choke prices

A critical aspect of production functions with a constant elasticity of substitution that remains
below unity is that the cost goes to infinity as the price of a single commodity goes to infinity.
Hence, the losses of going to autarky are infinite for any country that cannot produce a specific
commodity but has a positive demand for it, since it leads to infinite prices.
One may argue, however, that technology or sufficient effort might provide a substitute for a
commodity at a finite cost. To allow for such a possibility, and to allow for a higher elasticity
of substitution when a specific commodity becomes too expensive, we consider an alternative
production function for downstream industries that leads to a choke price in each commodity, i.e.
a finite price level above which demand for that commodity is null. Specifically, we consider the
following production function:

3.4.2

Land allocation

In our baseline model, each commodity relies on a specific natural resource. Instead, one could
argue that natural resources, such as land, can be used to produce any commodity, with varying
productivities. To do so, we assume a production function in one input (land) with a constant
elasticity of transformation between outputs. This generates a productivity possibility frontier
(PPF) that is sufficiently concave, which reflects the low elasticity of supply for commodities. This
specification is equivalent to other studies in the trade literature modeling land allocation (Costinot
et al. 2016) and labor allocation (Galle et al. 2017) across crops, tasks, or industries. A constant
elasticity of transformation PPF as here is isomorphic to production with heterogeneous inputs
(heterogeneous land parcels or heterogeneous workers) whose productivity for each type of output
(crop or industry) is drawn independently from a Frechet distribution for which the distribution
parameter is identical across crops or industries.
Specifically, we assume that land can be used to produce any commodity g with productivity
Aig such that the following constraint holds:

is both the share of land Ti devoted to the production of commodity g and the share of land income
associated with commodity g. Total income from land is then given by ∑g Yig = Ti Φi . With this
specification, if we assume that each commodity accounts for a relatively small share of total land
use, the elasticity of supply is simply equal to the elasticity of transformation ρ.

Calibration of the model

In this section, we describe how our data can be used to calibrate the model in order to compute
the gains from trade and other counterfactuals.
Commodity production and trade. We use our production and trade data at the commodity
level to directly calibrate production values YigC , demand DCig , and import shares λCnig . Demand DCng
C (the sum of import values), where X C , or internal trade flows, are
is calibrated as DCng ≡ ∑i Xnig
iig
C
C
C
defined by Xiig ≡ Yig − ∑n6=i Xnig (production - exports), if this is nonnegative, and zero otherwise
28

(zeros are further discussed in Section 4.1). To ensure that trade, production and consumption are
all harmonized, we use a slightly more aggregated classification than we do for most stylized facts.
Table 6 in the Appendix provides the full list of commodities in our calibration.21
Downstream industries. We combine our commodity data with information on secondary industries across broad sectors: production YikF , demand DFik , trade shares λFnik , expenditure shares
αnk as well as end use shares digk , i.e. the share of commodity g output used in manufacturing
industry k. Here, we compare two strategies to construct commodity-industry linkages.
Focusing on the year 2007, we use GTAP data to obtain harmonized cross-country production and consumption data across 29 downstream manufacturing sectors. We also use GTAP data
to provide usage information for agricultural products and fuels by downstream industries (when
GTAP commodity sectors are more aggregated we associate downstream industries on a proportional basis). For minerals, we use data from the USGS to obtain end uses for each finely-defined
commodity by NAICS 3-digit purchasing industry, which we match with the GTAP industrial
classification.22 This combination of GTAP and USGS data provide digk , which we then use to
construct the direct use coefficients ϕik,g = digk DCig /YikF , i.e. the value of commodities g used to
produce one dollar of output in industry k in the baseline equilibrium. The share of labor is simply
ϕik,L = 1 − ∑g ϕik,g .
As a robustness check, a more simple alternative is to assume that there are two downstream
industries: manufacturing and services, the latter of which does not use commodities. We then
calibrate production in each sector to match overall GDP (adjusted for value-added in primary
sectors) and the share of services provided in the World Bank online data.
Natural resource intensity. Next, we calibrate the share of natural resources in the production
costs of each commodity as well as the share of natural resources in total income. GTAP data provide information on the share of land and natural resources in the production costs of commodities
for each country across broadly defined industries (see Table 4 for summary statistics). We then
assume that resource uses are identical across commodities within each GTAP sector and country.
An alternative option that does not rely on GTAP data, and can be implemented for other years,
is to assume that the share ϕig,R of natural resources in production costs is constant and equals ϕiR
across all commodities within a country i. We would then calibrate ϕiR such that the total share
of income from natural resources, etot
iR = ∑g eig , matches the aggregate natural income share values
21. Each commodity g corresponds to a 4-digit or 6-digit Harmonized System category, with a few exceptions.
Aggregation is discussed in the data appendix, and we post on our website the exact mapping with 6-digit HS codes.
22. The USGS provides end uses for each mineral across US manufacturing industries. For other countries, we
reallocate the use of each commodity g across industries k (that appear in the US end-use data) proportionally to
output YikF of each industry k in that country.

29

C
provided by the World Bank. In this case, the resource intensity is given by: ϕiR = etot
iR Ei / ∑g Yig ,
where YigC denotes commodity production, and Ei denotes GDP. These shares are between 30 and
45% for most countries, and usually close to the ones obtained with our baseline strategy.

Elasticities. Last, we need to calibrate the model parameters θk (trade elasticity for downstream
sectors), θg (trade elasticity for commodities), ηk (elasticity of substitution between labor and commodities in the downstream sectors), ρg (elasticity of substitution between labor and natural resources in the upstream sectors) and σ.
We follow Simonovska and Waugh (2014) and other papers estimating trade elasticities and
assign θk = 5 for downstream industries. As discussed in Fact 4 and Table 3, commodities do
not seem to have significantly higher trade elasticities, hence we set θg = 5 for commodities in
our baseline calibration. We also explore alternative value choices where we quadruple the trade
elasticity to θg = 20 for all primary commodities, keeping θk = 5 for downstream industries.
More important are the demand and supply elasticities, which are determined by ηk and ρg in
our model. We use a value of 0.4 for both ηk and ρg , which generate price elasticities of demand
ϕig,L
≈ 1.5). This is
close to 0.4 and price elasticities of supply close to 0.6 (see equation 10 with ϕig,R
a conservative choice. As documented in Table 1 and Appendix Figures 6, 14(a) and 14(b), this
is above a majority of elasticity estimates in the literature. We will also examine alternative value
choices to illustrate the role of these elasticities.
When considering counterfactuals such as movements back to autarky, the most relevant elasticities of demand and supply will be long-run elasticities, rather than short-run elasticities, which
compose the majority of our surveyed estimates. Although in Appendix Table 6 we note that most
estimated long-run elasticities still tend to be less than unity in absolute value, the literature is
relatively scarcer for long run elasticity estimates. The ideal long-run elasticity estimates would
account for the role of technological innovation and resource discoveries; our aim is not to take
a stand on the “true” long run elasticity, but rather demonstrate the potential magnitudes of the
gains from trade assuming reasonably inelastic long-run demand and supply. In contrast, when
considering intermediate trade cost trade changes or supply shocks, short run elasticities are likely
more relevant.
The elasticity of substitution between the output of industries k in final demand plays a less
central role. In the baseline model, we assume σ = 1 (Cobb-Douglas) as is standard in recent trade
models (Caliendo and Parro 2015). In alternative calibrations, we specify σ = 0.4 as for other
elasticities of substitution (this value is close to the panel estimates of Comin et al. 2015), which
allows us to obtain closed form solutions for the gains from trade relative to autarky (Proposition 1).

At this level of aggregation, all countries (except the US) have at least one commodity with positive demand but no domestic production. In counterfactuals that consider only partial trade cost
changes, each country will still be able to import commodities to satiate its demand at a (potentially) higher price. However, when considering a full movement back to autarky, the price of a
commodity that is not produced domestically will be infinite in autarky if the elasticity of substitution with labor or other commodities is strictly smaller than unity. The aggregate gains from trade
will also be infinite in that case, as we can see for instance in equation 35 of Proposition 1 with
σ < 1. Motivated by various estimates indicating that even long-run elasticities are likely to be
smaller than unity in the current economy, we obtain that gains from trade are infinite unless:
i) zeros are measurement errors, not true zeros;
ii) elasticities of substitution are not constant and increase as we go to autarky.
We explore two venues that account for these possibilities. The first case is an empirical issue,
and a relevant one given the scarcity of commodity production data. We propose using gravity
equations to fill in (most) missing values using predicted internal trade in these cases. The second
issue we can address using the alternative version of the model with choke prices.
i) Using gravity equations to infer missing production A potential concern with trade and production data at this level of granularity is that they are somewhat noisy, and subject to measurement
errors. For instance, we find many cases where a country exports a commodity that it does not have
production of in our data, although some of this may be due to re-exporting.23
To address some of these concerns, we attempt to predict internal flows using gravity equations.
We propose a method that relies on key properties of the Poisson pseudo maximum-likelihood
(PPML) estimator. The first step is to estimate the following equation for trade flows for each
commodity g, allowing for a country-specific border effect βHomeBias,ng :
log Xnig = FXig + FMng + βDist,g log Distni + βContig,gContigni
+βLang,gCommonLangni + βColony,gColonyni + βHomeBias,n,g I(n = i) + εnig ,

(46)

Given the presence of exporter, importer and exporter-specific border effects, fitted values for
total exports, total production, total expenditures – and therefore also internal flows – will be
automatically equal to observed values (Fally 2015). Exporter and importer fixed effects can be
identified, even if there are missing internal flow data log Xnng . However, with such missing values,
the home bias coefficient cannot be identified (see Appendix for more details).
23. Another indication of measurement issues is that different publications provide different statistics. For instance,
various mining trade publications provide slightly more comprehensive, although similar, production statistics.

31

To compute the home bias coefficient for missing internal flows, we employ GTAP data at a
more aggregated level, which features much fewer zero internal flows, assuming that a countryspecific border effect is common across commodities g within each GTAP industry category G.
To compute a given value of β̂HomeBias,iG , we use equation 46 to predict internal flows and then
calibrate β̂HomeBias,iG such that we match internal flows in GTAP at the aggregate level. Using
this coefficient along with those of estimated equation 46, we can predict internal flows. The
idea underlying this is as follows: if a country is missing production values for oranges, then the
production and consumption of that country at the aggregate industry level (the GTAP industry
“vegetables and fruit”) is informative about the relative size of internal flows. In turn, gravity
equations at the commodity level inform us about the patterns of comparative advantage within this
aggregate industry, which helps us determine relative production volumes across commodities.
This approach is remarkably efficient in reducing the number of zeros in production across
countries and commodities. The number of zeros is reduced by 72% if we take a raw count, and
reduced by 98% if we weight zeros by the value of imports for that country and commodity. For
remaining cases, accounting for just 2% of imports with missing production, we exclude them
from our calculations by normalizing demand to zero at the country and commodity level.24
ii) Model with choke prices The difficulty in using the alternative specification in choke prices
is where to set the cutoff at which demand for each commodity goes to zero, a phenomenon with
little historical precedent. Although this is an inherently difficult parameter to infer, there are reasons to believe that a choke price would be quite large compared to current prices. In equation
39, when choke prices become closer to the current price (that is, when ∆ig → 1), demand for a
given commodity becomes infinitely elastic. However, as we survey in Appendix Table 6, estimated price elasticities of demand for a variety of commodities across different countries and time
periods are all rather low, whether in the short or long run. Further, the relatively high volatility of
commodity prices relative to wages is well explained by low price elasticities of demand for such
inputs (Cafiero et al. 2011).

Counterfactual simulations

We can now solve for equations (14)-(25) to simulate partial trade costs changes and equations
(14), (15), (22)-(25) and (30)-(31) to simulate full autarky. We explore various counterfactuals to
illustrate the role of commodities:
24. We do so also for tiny values of internal flows leading to λng < 0.01. Our results are robust to alternative
censoring or winsorizing treatments.

32

• Gains from trade relative to autarky: Our first but most speculative counterfactual is to
simulate a full movement back to autarky. Even if autarky is highly hypothetical, it is a useful
benchmark to compare to the literature (e.g. Costinot and Rodrı́guez-Clare 2014). The main
point is to show that commodities can rationalize much larger gains from trade relative to
more standard models. We also use the comparison to autarky to describe the gains from
trade across factors of production and the role of the different elasticities.
• Intermediate changes in trade costs: We simulate more modest changes in trade costs
to examine whether commodities are relatively less important for smaller changes in trade
costs.
• Tariffs: We examine the extent to which the role of commodities and natural resources is
muted or magnified when we consider the introduction of tariffs. In particular, as demand
and supply are less elastic for commodities, the deadweight loss from tariffs may differ from
more standard models without commodities.
• Export taxes: We also examine to what extent initial distortions may affect our estimates of
the gains from trade. To do so, we recompute the gains relative to autarky by assuming that
commodity exporters initially charge optimal export taxes (or equivalently optimal markups
if there is a single producer in each country exploiting its market power, such as De Beers
for South African diamond production).
• Critical suppliers: To illustrate the role of the geographic concentration of resources and
production, we explore counterfactuals where we shut down trade of a given commodity only
for the top exporter, and examine how this shock affects prices and costs in other countries.
We highlight the particular role of China, the top exporter of many commodities.

5.1

Gains from trade relative to autarky

Aggregate gains from trade There are multiple ways to illustrate the gains from trade in our
model relative to more standard models. First we compare to a model where labor is the only input
to the commodity production process, which is essentially equivalent to allowing for a much more
elastic supply of commodities, since labor (unlike resources) is freely mobile across sectors. In
Figure 3, we show the aggregate gains from trade for each country, with log gains in our baseline
calibration on the vertical axis, compared to a model that uses only labor, with its predicted log
gains on the horizontal axis. We find that the use of natural resources in the production process
yields much larger gains from trade; all outcomes are above the 45-degree line.
We also compute the gains from trade in our model relative to a model that only has final goods
as possible products (and only labor as input). Appendix Figure 21 shows that we obtain similar

Figure 3: Gains from trade relative to model with only labor
results to those in Figure 3: the difference between the two models is now even slightly larger,
since trade in final goods alone yields smaller benefits.
In these results, we use the method described in section 4.1i) to infer production using gravity
equations, which limits the number of cases in which countries have positive demand for a commodity but no production, leading to potentially infinite gains from trade. However, an alternative
is simply to set demand to zero in all cases in which domestic consumption of a commodity g is
less than 0.01 (λng < 0.01). In Appendix Figure 22, we replicate the results of Figure 3 (comparing the aggregate gains from trade in our baseline model to one without natural resources) using
gravity adjusted trade flows, and find similar results with only slightly smaller gains from trade.
With choke prices Very large gains from trade arise when prices are very high for at least some
commodities. One may be worried that in those cases, an economy would be able to find substitutes
to that commodity. Such substitution would lead to a choke price, i.e. a price upper bound above
which demand for that commodity would drop to zero. In Section 3.4.1, we describe one way
to account for such choke price. To calibrate such model, one needs to know the value of ∆ig
capturing the ratio of the current price relative to the choke price. To illustrate the sensitivity of
our results to the presence of choke prices, we provide alternative counterfactual simulations with
values ∆ig = 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2 respectively, which correspond to choke prices being roughly 1800,
316, and 56 times higher than the current price, respectively, with ηk = 0.4. Results are depicted in
Figure 4. In spite of the presence of a choke price, we find that the gains from trade are still much

larger than in the case without natural resources (and without choke prices). Of course, higher
values of ∆ig – corresponding to lower choke prices – lead to smaller gains from trade.
As we do not have reliable estimates of choke prices, we return to the previous approach to
provide additional results on gains from trade, e.g. on gains from trade across factors of production
and the role of elasticities. The same results hold qualitatively if we instead specify a choke price.
Heterogeneous gains from trade Figure 5 compares the gains from trade for workers and natural resources relative to the aggregate gains from trade. First, we can see that workers fare better in
our model as a country opens to trade. Most points are above the 45-degree line: worker welfare
gains (on the y-axis) are almost always larger than aggregate gains in each economy (x-axis). This
indicates that the share of labor wages in total income tends to increase with trade and that, on
aggregate, the relative price of commodities tends to decrease.
The consequences of trade for natural resource owners is however highly heterogeneous. On
the same figure, we plot the average log gains from trade (weighted by initial income share) for
owners of natural resources. As we can see, gains for resource owners have a high variance across
countries. We also confirm that, within countries, there is a high variance in the gains from trade
across types of resources, with big winners for instance in Russia, Norway, Saudi Arabia among
other resource-rich countries. We further show in Appendix (Figure 23) how resource owners fare
relative to autarky depending on whether the commodity using these resources tends to be exported

Figure 5: Heterogeneous gains from trade
or imported (on net). The intuition is in line with specific-factor models, as owners of resources
used for commodities that are imported tend to lose from trade, while others tend to gain.
Role of supply and demand elasticities. As noted in the theory section, the gains from trade
in primary commodities depend on supply and demand elasticities. To illustrate the role of these
elasticities, we solve for a counterfactual autarky equilibrium using alternative values of demand
and supply elasticities. In our baseline calibration, we assume that the elasticities of substitution
ηk and ρg are equal to 0.4 (leading to price elasticities of demand and supply equal to 0.4 and
0.6 respectively). In Figure 6, we examine the gains from trade for our model if we assume
ηk = ρg = 0.95, i.e. almost Cobb-Douglas. For each set of elasticities, we compare our results
to a model with a single factor (labor).We plot log gains from trade for each country on the vertical
axis while we plot gains from trade from the single-factor model on the horizontal axis. When we
assume higher elasticities of substitution, the gains from trade decrease quickly. For elasticities
close to unity, the gains from trade are fairly similar to the single-factor model (45-degree line).
In Appendix Figure 24, we further explore the sensitivity to alternate values of elasticities. Higher
elasticities that remain below unity (0.6 for demand and 0.9 for supply) yield smaller gains from
trade than our baseline specification, but still a notable difference from the single-factor model.
For elasticities larger than unity, the gains from trade are essentially identical to the single-factor
model and are considerably smaller than in our baseline model.

Figure 6: Gains from Trade (Aggregate) for Different Elasticities of Substitution
The gains from trade for resource owners are highly heterogeneous and often large, as discussed
previously in Figure 5. Interestingly, gains from trade for natural resource owners are smaller and
less dispersed when elasticities of substitution are higher as we illustrate in Figure 25. Intuitively,
the role of natural resources and commodities is muted in that case.
While the results above highlight the role of the supply and demand elasticities for commodities, one can notice that the gains from trade are large in spite of relatively higher elasticities of
substitution between final goods in consumer preferences (σ = 1 in the baseline specification).
This implies that the elasticity of substitution across final goods is not as crucial but its role is
not negligible. If a commodity becomes prohibitively expensive, substitution with final goods that
do not rely on this commodity alleviates the loss from autarky. Indeed, we obtain even larger
gains from trade, especially for small countries, when we specify a lower elasticity of substitution
between final goods – see Figure 8 below and Figure 26 in Appendix with σ = 0.4.
Covariates Next, we investigate how country characteristics correlate with the gains from trade
in our model in Figure 7. As is well known, in most models, smaller countries tend to gain more
from trade. As depicted in panel (a), we find that the negative correlation between gains from trade
and market size is even starker (more negative) when we account for commodities and natural
resources. The intuition is simple. Smaller countries tend to have less diverse natural resources
and when they open to trade, specialize in the production of only a few commodities and gain

access to various other commodities that cannot be produced domestically.25
Second, as documented in panel (b) of Figure 7, we find a more negative (although not statistically significant) relationship between the gains from trade and per capita income across countries.
In comparison, this correlation is positive (though insignificant) in a standard model with only labor, where natural resources do not play a role. With commodities, the negative correlation with
per capita income is partly driven by the fact that poorer countries also tend to have a smaller
market size (in terms of GDP).
We also examine other country characteristics, such as the share of natural resource income in
GDP, but find no significant relationship or change relative to more standard models.
25. We also find a stronger (negative) correlation with country size in terms of land area.

5.2

Sensitivity to alternative specifications

Trade elasticity. The trade elasticity for commodities plays a more muted role in explaining the
gains from trade, unlike in standard models where the gains from trade (in log) are proportional
to the trade elasticity. As shown in Figure 8 for a selection of countries and Appendix Figure 27
for all countries, a higher elasticity of θg = 20 for commodities leads to only slightly lower gains
from trade in comparison to θg = 5. Contrary to the standard formula for the gains from trade
(Arkolakis et al. 2012), in this context a doubling of the trade elasticity for commodities would not
cut the (log) gains in half: the gains from trade in our model still largely exceed the gains from
trade without natural resources (still three times larger for the median country).
Model of land allocation In Section 3.4.2, we consider an alternative model of commodity production with a single factor of production (land) that can be allocated to producing different commodities with a constant elasticity of transformation (CET). This version is also isomorphic to a
Roy model of land allocation with a continuum of parcels with i.i.d. productivity draws (from
a Frechet distribution) associated with each commodity (as in Galle et al. 2017). We calibrate
this model using the same production and trade data and the same parameter values for ρ = 0.4
(and η = 0.4) as in the baseline model. As shown in Figure 8 (and Appendix Figure 29(a) for all
countries), the gains from trade are still large – actually larger than in the baseline model.
Types of commodities Are the large gains from trade with commodities driven by specific
groups of commodities? We examine the robustness of our results by replacing natural resources
(fixed factors) by labor for certain groups of commodities: either fuels, minerals or agricultural
products. Results shown with the hollow symbols in Figure 8 (and Appendix Figure 30 for all
countries) indicate that broadly our findings are not driven by a few specific commodities (e.g.
oil). On average, we obtain large gains from trade even when we “remove” a broad type of commodity, i.e. shutting down the role of natural resources for either fuels, minerals or agriculture.
Aggregation of downstream sectors In Figure 29(b), we compare the gains from trade from
our baseline model with services and multiple downstream sectors to a model with services but
only one downstream sector, manufacturing. We find that the gains from trade are larger with
only one manufacturing sector. The main reason is that in our baseline model consumers can
better substitute between final goods (e.g. cars vs. plastic products) when either one lacks a key
commodity and thus becomes prohibitively expensive. In the baseline model, the upper tier of
consumption is Cobb-Douglas across final goods, whereas in the one-sector model, the final good
requires all commodities and has no substitutes.

39

Figure 8: Gains from trade across different specifications (% GT, truncated at 400%)
A third point of comparison would be to have preferences with a lower elasticity of substitution
σ between multiple final goods. If we set σ = 0.4 (which we refer to as “CES final goods” in
Figure 8) instead of unity (Cobb-Douglas), we find that the gains from trade are actually larger
than both the Cobb-Douglas and the single-industry specifications.
A more conservative commodity classification. As a robustness check, we can use an alternative classification table which is potentially more conservative than the correspondence table that
we use for most of our counterfactuals. To construct a potentially more conservative table, we only
use less refined mineral commodity production and trade data accounting for 14.3% of total trade
in 2007 (the baseline data accounts for 20.2% of trade that year). For instance, in the baseline
classification, we aggregate the value of mined and smelted copper, whereas in our conservative
correspondence, we only consider mined copper (for more details, the full correspondences are
provided online for both classifications). We compute the gains from trade relative to using only
labor to produce commodities using this conservative classification in Appendix Figure 28, and
find similar, only marginally smaller, gains from trade relative to our baseline.

Aggregation of commodities One of the key issues that we wish to highlight is the importance
of examining detailed data by commodity. If we were to only use aggregate data for primary
production (e.g. aggregating all minerals), we would miss much of the gains from trade and specialization. We illustrate this point in Figure 31 in the Appendix, where we compare the gains
from trade in our baseline model to one where all primary commodities are pooled into one single
commodity sector. We find that imputed gains from trade are much smaller when commodities are
aggregated into a single sector, close to what we find in a model without commodities.
Other years If downstream sectors are aggregated and detailed downstream sector data from
GTAP are not used, we can calibrate the model for other years than 2007. In Figure 32 in the
Appendix we calibrate the gains from trade in a model with 1995-2013 commodity production data
in the single-downstream-sector model. For all years, we find that the gains from trade are much
larger than in a more standard model without natural resources – hence 2007 is not an exception.
In both versions of the model, gains from trade increase over time (since the baseline economy is
increasingly open) and the differences between the two specifications are fairly constant.

5.3

Partial trade cost changes

Instead of comparing with autarky, the next counterfactuals examine more realistic partial changes
in trade costs. Since commodities face a low elasticity of demand (are difficult to substitute) but
account for only a modest share of world trade, the effects of trade costs are very non-linear. The

Figure 10: Gains from trade across countries – intermediate changes in trade costs
elasticity of substitution does not matter as much when changes in trade costs are small (i.e. the
Arkolakis et al. 2012 formula provides a good approximation), but a sizable difference appears
when trade costs changes become larger as seen in Figure 9. In this figure, we increase trade costs
increase by 10% in each iteration. After ten iterations, median welfare losses (in log) are about
30% larger with low elasticities of substitution. If we focus on labor, the standard model no longer
provides a good approximation of the gains from trade. Even for small changes in trade costs (dash
lines in Figure 9), the gains from trade for labor in a model with primary commodities are about
50% larger (for the median country) than in standard models with higher substitution or no natural
resources. We document the heterogeneity across countries in Figure 10.

5.4

With distortions: tariffs and export taxes

Tariffs Rather than changes in trade costs, one may be interested in changes in tariffs and tariff
revenues generated by trade in commodities. With particularly low demand and supply elasticities,
we can expect smaller deadweight losses and thus much smaller welfare losses compared with
changes in trade costs.
Several equations describing equilibrium and counterfactual changes need to be adjusted. With
import tariffs tng and tnk on commodities g and industries k, the changes in trade costs are:
τc
nig = 1 + tnig . Income should now include tariff revenues, given by:
nik = 1 + tnik and τc

and sales are now equal to: YigC = ∑n (Cig τnig )−θg (1 + tng )−1−θg Pngg Dng , with a similar expression

share 1/(1 + tng ) of the value of trade flows is earned by country i.

We simulate a 100% worldwide increase in tariffs in 10% increments, and illustrate the results
in Figure 11. Once tariff revenues are accounted for, one can see in Figure 11 that there is almost
no difference in aggregate welfare losses between the baseline model and a more standard model
without natural resources. Implications for labor income are less negligible, as shown with difference between the two dash lines, indicating slightly larger effects on redistribution of welfare
across factors of production within countries.

Export taxes Simulating autarky starting from an imperfectly-competitive equilibrium with export taxes or optimal markups (on international markets) turns out to be very simple, with only
minimal changes relative to the baseline counterfactual simulation. The main adjustment is to recalibrate the share of income related to labor and natural resources, now accounting for a non-zero
share of profits or tax revenues.
In this counterfactual, we assume that each country (for each commodity) charges the optimal
export tax, equal to the inverse of the import demand elasticity. For each commodity and country,
we obtain a model-based estimate of the import demand elasticity by simulating a 1% increase in
country level production costs for that commodity, and we use this estimate to calibrate the initial
share of profits or tax revenues in the initial equilibrium.26
Interestingly, simulations starting from an equilibrium with distortions yield even larger gains
from trade relative to when we start from a competitive equilibrium. The increment (in log gains)
is equal to 0.1 on average, ranging from 0.02 to 0.2 for almost all countries.27 The calibrated
gains are even larger because, conditional on observed trade flows, the initial equilibrium features
additional sources of revenues and larger differences in productivity and endowments in resources.

5.5

Reliance on critical suppliers

As shown in Fact 9, the production of commodities is highly specialized across a few key exporters.
This reliance on a few suppliers would lead to high costs associated with barriers to trade with such
suppliers. We conduct a set of counterfactuals to illustrate the interdependence of nations and the
critical role of the top exporter of any given commodity.
To illustrate and quantify the role of critical suppliers, we simulate a counterfactual equilibrium for each commodity where we shut down trade with the top exporter of that commodity, and
examine the effect on commodity prices for other countries. There are two main channels through
which these embargos influence prices. First, holding factor prices and production costs Cbig constant, cutting trade from a source country leads to a higher price index Pbig – this effect is highest
for the largest exporter. Second, shutting down trade with any given exporter forces to increase
production of that commodity in other source countries. Given the low price elasticity of supply
facing commodities, this can potentially lead to large increases in producer prices and costs Cbig –
in the model, this is due to hiring additional workers at a low marginal product of labor.
We provide the results of these counterfactuals in Figure 12, where we plot the distribution of
log Pbig and log Cbig across countries i and commodities g after excluding from world trade the main
exporter of that commodity (e.g. Chile for copper, Indonesia for tin). We also provide it separately
for each type of commodity (agriculture, fuels and minerals) in Appendix Figure 34. These figures

Figure 12: Shutting down trade with the top exporter: effect on prices and production costs
(simulation for each commodity at a time; left: all cases; right: when top exporter is China)
indicate significantly large increases in prices in all cases. The more muted effects on fuel prices
indicate the smaller share of the top exporter in the world supply of fuels. A large part of the
price increase corresponds to the cost of having to produce more, as shown in Figure 12 where the
distribution of log Cbig (hollow bars with blue contours) is close to the one for log Pbig .
China as a critical supplier. China is the top exporter for fifteen commodities listed in Table 8.
As a large exporter, a Chinese export embargo of those commodities leads to large effects on prices
and production costs. The distribution of those price and cost shocks across importing countries
for these commodities is shown in the right panel of Figure 12. It is skewed to the right: the median
(in log) is 0.17 for prices (0.16 for costs) and the 90th percentile equals 1.27 (1.31 for costs).
In Table 8, we show in particular the counterfactual effect on prices for these commodities in
the US. The largest impact would be for rare earth minerals. In recent experience, price increases
of rare earth minerals of 525% (1.83 log increase) between the period of 2009-2011 associated
with a partial Chinese export embargo on rare earth minerals are similar to our predicted price
increase. On the contrary, for iron, the simulated effect on US prices is limited to a 10% increase.

Concluding remarks

In this paper, we emphasize the importance of commodities in international trade and demonstrate
that upon consideration of the specific characteristics of primary commodity markets, such as low
elasticities of demand and supply and a high dispersion of production, the gains from trade can
greatly exceed those implied by standard models.
To arrive at these conclusions, an important step is to compile a new dataset containing information on trade, production, prices and demand for commodities at a disaggregated level. Using
this dataset, we document that commodity production and trade tends to be highly concentrated
within a few producers, and additionally, that export revenues of many countries are concentrated
in a few commodities. We conduct a comprehensive meta-analysis to highlight the low price
elasticity of demand and supply of commodities, while we also note that trade elasticities for commodities appear to be generally similar to those for manufacturing goods. Given these facts, it is
less surprising that commodities play a crucial role in trade.
We develop a tractable model that can account for such features, which is easily compared to
standard trade models. It is amenable to calibration and can be used to simulate various counterfactual policy changes; we provide such counterfactual simulations to highlight the role of commodities and natural resources under both small and large changes in trade costs and tariffs, and
illustrate the mechanisms behind our results. In many cases, the welfare gains from trade depend
largely on suppliers who account for the bulk of world commodity production; we find that shutting down trade with the top exporter for many commodities leads to large increases in commodity
prices for downstream producers.
Overall, our results suggest that although primary commodities have a modest share in world
trade, commodities are crucial inputs to many production processes, and thus have critical importance to international trade policy and welfare. The decline of the share of primary commodities in
world trade must be considered against the large decreases in tariffs and transportation costs over
the past seventy years, and the resulting large increase in trade volume relative to GDP. Increasing
barriers to trade would lead to a resurgence of the share of primary commodities in total costs and
larger welfare losses.
Some questions remain unanswered as to the potential magnitudes of the gains of trade. An
open and policy-relevant question remains as to whether technological innovation and substitution
patterns would yield long-run demand and supply responses that could mitigate some of these
potentially large long-term losses associated with trade cost increases. Most demand and supply
response estimates focus on short to medium-run responses, and reliable estimates of long-run
elasticities are scarce. Further research in this area would be particularly relevant to better quantify
the benefits from international trade and the impact of trade policy reforms.
