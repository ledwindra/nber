ABSTRACT
This article examines the relationship between Research & Development (R&D) funding and the production
of knowledge by academic chemists. Using articles published, either raw counts or adjusted for quality,
we find a strong, positive causal effect of funding on knowledge production. This effect is similar
across subsets of universities, suggesting a relatively efficient allocation of R&D funds. Finally, we
document a rapid acceleration in the rate at which chemical knowledge was produced in the late 1990s
and early 2000s relative to the financial and human resources devoted to its production.

In 2011 the federal government supported nearly $40 billion dollars of
university research and development (R&D) activities. Other sources of funding –
including industry, state government and the universities themselves – provided
over $22 billion in support for university R&D. It is natural to wonder what these
investments produce or, put slightly differently, what is the return on this
investment?1 In large part, public investments in R&D are motivated by the
conviction that advances in scientific understanding will contribute to the nation’s
economic growth. Yet, we still have relatively limited knowledge about the
relationship between R&D funding, the production of scientific knowledge, and the
effects of this knowledge on socioeconomic outcomes. The first step in linking
federal R&D funding to economic growth is to identify whether funding affects
knowledge production. Thus, our study examines the effect of federal and nonfederal R&D funding for chemistry research on knowledge production in these
fields, measured by publications and citations. After controlling for the endogeneity
of research funding, we find that that federal and non-federal chemistry research
funding increases chemistry publications and citations.
We focus on academic chemistry and chemical engineering in this study
because basic and applied chemistry account for a substantial share—slightly more
than 4%—of all federal R&D expenditures. Moreover, the chemical sciences are
large, well-established and widely represented across the spectrum of U.S.
universities and they include a breadth of research topics from basic science to
highly applied topics. As such, they offer an excellent opportunity to explore the

3
impact of federal and other sources of funding on scientific productivity. In
addition, discoveries in chemistry are more likely to result in patents and other
forms of commercialization. Thus identifying the effect of federal R&D chemistry
funding on knowledge production is the first step in linking federal R&D
expenditures to product innovations resulting in economic growth and
development.
This article contributes to a greater understanding of these relationships
through an examination of the relationship between R&D funding and the
knowledge outputs produced by academic chemists receiving this funding over the
20 years from 1990 to 2009. Measuring knowledge outputs either by the raw
number of articles published or adjusting for the quality of publications by
weighting each by the number of citations it received, we document a strong,
positive causal effect of funding on knowledge production. At the same time, our
analysis also reveals that there was a rapid acceleration in the production of
chemical science knowledge in the late 1990s and early 2000s relative to the
quantities of both financial and human resources devoted to its production. In
contrast to earlier research, which found that numbers of publications grew at
roughly the same rate as funding inputs in the 1980s, we find that the number of
articles produced grew much more quickly than either financial or human inputs
into knowledge production after 1990. Put somewhat differently, we show that the
cost per article written fell substantially in these years. Moreover, this trend toward
declining costs occurred across a broad spectrum of institutions of higher education.

4
We begin, in the next section, with a discussion of previous research on the
relationship between funding and knowledge production. Next we discuss our data
sources and provide an overview of sample characteristics. We then examine
aggregate characteristics before turning to an econometric analysis of the
relationship between knowledge production and R&D funding.

The Relationship between Research Funding and Knowledge Production
We are not the first to investigate the relationship between R&D funding and
knowledge production, but the research is rather limited. Previous work has taken
a number of different approaches to this problem, reflecting different conceptions of
the appropriate unit of measurement. One approach, exemplified by a recent study
by Jacob and Lefgren (2011), looks at the impact of receiving a grant on the
productivity of an individual researcher. Utilizing administrative data from the
National Institutes of Health (NIH) on all training and standard grant proposals
submitted between 1980 and 2000, Jacob and Lefgren estimate the effects of being
awarded a grant versus not receiving the grant on a scholar’s subsequent
publication. To control for project quality they estimate the causal effects of a
successful grant application through a regression discontinuity design that exploits
the fact that funded and unfunded proposals with similar priority scores are
comparable in quality. Although they do find a positive effect of funding on
subsequent publication, the size of this effect appears quite modest, resulting in
approximately one additional publication in the subsequent 5 years.2

5
These results are intriguing, but as Jacob and Lefgren acknowledge, they are
subject to important limitations. Most importantly, it is not possible, given their
empirical set up, to determine whether investigators placed in the control group
because they did not receive funding in a particular funding round may have been
successful in a later resubmission or were able to obtain resources for their
research from another source. To the extent that the control-group includes
investigators who subsequently obtained funding, the estimated effects of receiving
a grant will be biased downward.
Another factor that will produce a downward bias in estimates at the
individual level is the likely effect of leakages and spillovers in the effects of funding.
Research support to individual academic researchers includes the direct costs of the
research and sizeable payments to their university employers in the form of “over
head” or indirect costs (Facilities & Administration) in order to support the broader
scientific enterprise. These resources presumably support a broader set of
researchers and research infrastructure. Further, the activity and resources of
funded investigators may indirectly encourage research output by unfunded
colleagues by providing a foundation of support for these investigators and
supporting the institutional resources that benefit the research activities of their
graduate students and postdoctoral researchers.
To better capture the effect of these spillovers, several researchers have
examined how R&D funding affects outputs at the level of universities and the
university system as a whole. Blume-Kohout, Kumar and Sood (2009) investigated
whether federal R&D life science funding was a complement or a substitute for non-

6
federal R&D funding. They found that federal and non-federal funding were
complements. Adams and Griliches (1998) examined the relationship between
R&D funding and research publications at 109 universities in the period 1981-1993
by analyzing aggregate spending and publications in 8 broad disciplinary categories.
Relying on an informal analysis of graphs showing the growth of R&D expenditures
and publications or citations in each discipline, they concluded that at the aggregate,
university-system level, the levels of funding and scholarly outputs grew roughly in
parallel with one another in most of the disciplines they considered. They then used
panel regressions for a subset of universities with complete data to estimate the
elasticity of publications or citations relative to funding. In contrast to the elasticity
near one suggested by the aggregate data, they found cross-section elasticities in the
range of about 0.4, up to a high of 0.9. They suggested that this discrepancy might
be attributable to the leakages and spillovers alluded to earlier.
More recently Payne and Siow (2003) have examined the connections
between federal R&D funding and research output. Their analysis is more
aggregated than Adams and Griliches, however, reporting a single aggregate
estimate for all disciplines of the effect of federal R&D funds on research output
using a panel of 57 universities for the period 1981-1998. Payne and Siow
recognized that because R&D funding is not allocated randomly across institutions,
OLS regression results cannot be interpreted as reflecting the causal effect of
funding on output. To resolve this latter problem, they proposed an instrumental
variables approach that relies on the effect of university alumni representation on
key congressional appropriations committees. Using this instrument they found

7
that an additional $1 million in federal R&D funding results in an increase of
approximately 10 publications. Further, they concluded that there was no
relationship between the level of funding and the number of citations per article.
Payne and Siow’s instrument lacks power, however, and the impact of congressional
representation on the award of merit-based scientific R&D awards might be
questioned a priori.
Finally, Whalley and Hicks (2014) examined the relationship between
university research expenditures and knowledge production measured by
publications, citations and patents for a panel of 96 research universities between
1985-1996. Like Payne and Siow, their analysis aggregated knowledge outputs and
funding across different disciplines. However, they controlled for the endogeneity
of funding by using changes in university endowment values as a source of
exogenous variation in research expenditures. They foundnd that increases in
research expenditures increased the number of publications but had no causal
impact on the average citations per paper, nor the number of patents.
The previous literature described above is dated, examining the impact of
research funding on knowledge production through the mid-1990s. Given the
changes in technology including the personal computer and Internet revolutions,
the relationship between federal R&D funding and knowledge production has likely
changed. These studies also miss important changes in federal funding priorities
such as the NIH budget doubling (1998-2003) (Couzin and Miller 2007) as well as
substantial increases in the NSF budget during the same period.3 Furthermore,
Payne and Siow (2003) and Whalley and Hicks (2014) combine R&D funding and

8
aggregate publication and citation counts across all disciplines at the university
level. In addition, their high level of aggregation would likely “average out”
important shifts in federal funding priorities in previous decades.
Like these previous studies, we exploit variations in funding levels over time
across a panel of universities. Focusing on the behavior of the university-system
broadly and on the output of individual universities is more likely to capture the
ways in which research funding supports the broader scientific system. Yet unlike
these previous studies, we believe it is important to look at these effects at the level
of individual disciplines because of differences across the disciplines in knowledge
production, citation patterns, and the uses of funding. This approach is supported
by the differences in the funding-output relationship documented by Adams and
Griliches in their earlier study.

Data
We have collected data on the levels of research funding along with
publication and citation data in chemistry and chemical engineering (for brevity we
will refer to these combined fields as chemistry) for a sample of 147 universities
over twenty years, from 1990 through 2009. Although there are likely to be
differences in research practices and professional culture between chemistry and
chemical engineering, it is not practical to cleanly distinguish between these two
fields in the allocation of R&D funding or publications.4
Our sample was selected to include those universities that accounted for the
bulk of sponsored Research & Development expenditures in Chemistry. To identify

9
our sample institutions, we aggregated federally funded chemistry R&D
expenditures (in constant dollars) for the 20 years from 1990 through 2009 and
ranked them on the basis of this total. Initially we selected the top 150 institutions,
but later concluded it was necessary to drop three of these for which the data were
incomplete or appeared inconsistent.5 After identifying the sample, we collected
additional data on inputs in the knowledge production process, including degrees
awarded, graduate student enrollment, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty from
publicly available sources, and merged these with the R&D expenditure data. Data
on publications and citations were provided by Thomson Reuters, Research
Analytics group from the Web of Science citation data base. We worked closely with
Thomson Reuters to identify and match publications to our sample institutions.6
A list of each of the institutions included in our sample is provided in Table 1,
which also summarizes a number of key dimensions of real R&D expenditures and
outputs. As this table illustrates, our sample exhibits a considerable degree of
institutional variation. At the top of the list are institutions such as the MIT, Cal
Tech, and the University of California Berkeley, with average annual R&D
expenditures in the $20-$30 million range, employing more than 100 postdoctoral
researchers, training more than 50 doctoral recipients per year and producing many
hundreds of publications. At the bottom of our list are institutions such as Cleveland
State University or North Carolina Agricultural & Technical State University, with
total R&D expenditures of little more than $1 million per year, with few or no
postdoctoral researchers and doctoral recipients, and producing just tens of
publications.

10
Although the 147 institutions we study do not comprise the full extent of
academic research in chemistry, they account for the vast majority of the
measurable research and training activities in the United States. As Figure 1
illustrates, their shares of total U.S. research expenditures, Ph.D.s awarded and
postdoctoral researchers hovered around 90-95 percent, although their share of
non-federally funded research expenditures was somewhat lower at about 87
percent. In comparison to R&D expenditures and graduate education, the number of
publications is relatively less concentrated. Our sample institutions produced
between 70 and 75 percent of chemistry publications in most years. These
publications, however, received 80 to 85 percent of citations to U.S. publications
over this period, suggesting that researchers affiliated with these institutions
produced a greater proportion of the more important publications.
It should be noted that while the institutions in our sample accounted for a
stable or slightly rising share of U.S. publications and citations, the United States
share of total global publications in chemistry appears to have been declining
somewhat over time. Based on data provided by Thomson Reuters from their Web
of Science database, from 1990 through the early 2000s, U.S. publications accounted
for about 30 percent of all chemistry publications, but after 2003, this figure began
to drop, falling closer to 25 percent by 2009. U.S. publications do, however, receive
a greater proportion of total citations, suggesting that they remain more important
in global chemistry than the raw publication count would indicate. This share share
was also declining, however, over the last decade or so.

11
Table 2 provides additional details about the characteristics of both the full
sample and several important subsets of universities, reporting average annual
values of key variable for the periods 1990-1999 and 2000-2009. Across all
universities, average annual chemistry R&D expenditures increased from an
average of about $8 million in the 1990s to almost $11 million in 2000s. Federal
sources supported just under two-thirds of R&D spending in both periods, and grew
at roughly the same rate as overall R&D spending. In contrast to this growth in
expenditures, average numbers of graduate students enrolled, Ph.D.s awarded and
employment of postdoctoral researchers held relatively steady across the two
decades. On the other hand, the average number of publications produced and the
number of citations to those publications both nearly doubled. The growth in the
number of publications reflects both a rapid increase in the number of chemistry
journals included in the Web of Science database, which increased from 244 in 1990
to 568 by 2009, and an approximately 80 percent increase in the number of
publications in already established journals.
We categorized universities based on their Carnegie ranking and public or
private status. Comparing across categories, important differences emerge in Table
2. As we might expect, all of the indicators of both inputs and outputs of the
chemical sciences are much larger at those universities in the Carnegie Research I
classification than at the other, non-Research I institutions in our sample. The
Research I universities accounted, on average, for about 2.5 times the research
expenditures and produced nearly three times as many doctorates as the nonResearch I universities. They also employed more than three times as many

12
postdoctoral researchers and produced more than three times as many publications.
The imbalance in citations to publications was even more striking: for 2000-2009,
publications produced by the Research I institutions received almost 4.5 times as
many citations as those produced by the non-Research I group, down from a ratio of
more than 6 in the 1990s.
Although average research expenditures at public and private universities
were similar in the 1990s, their composition was somewhat different, with nonfederal funding making up almost 40 percent of total expenditures at public
universities, compared to less than 30 percent at the private universities. These
differences persisted over time, but funding received by the public universities grew
more quickly than did funding at the private universities. Average numbers of
graduate students enrolled were also higher at the public universities, but the
numbers of doctorates awarded and postdoctoral researchers were comparable
across the two groups. The average number of publications produced by public and
private universities was quite similar, but private university publications received
on average more citations than did those produced by the public universities. If
citations provide a measure of the significance of publications, this result suggests
that private universities were, on average, producing research of somewhat higher
quality than their public counterparts.

Aggregate Trends in Chemistry Research and Funding
Before exploring the causal effect of funding on knowledge production, we
consider some of the aggregate characteristics of research funding and scholarly

13
outputs of academic chemistry over the last two decades. We begin with the growth
of funding and personnel. Figure 2 compares the growth of R&D expenditures
(federally financed and total) with the number of doctorates awarded and numbers
of full-time faculty and postdoctoral researchers employed.7 To facilitate
comparison, each series is graphed as an index (set equal to 100 in 1990). Over
most of the period, federal and non-federal funding grew at comparable rates, but
since 2006, federal funding has stabilized while funding from non-federal sources
has continued to increase.
In comparison to the nearly 70 percent increase in total R&D funding, faculty
numbers were essentially flat over this 20 year period, while the number of
postdoctoral researchers increased only modestly. The number of postdoctoral
researchers did increase somewhat after 1996 and had grown by about 20 percent
by the end of our study period in 2009. The number of doctorates awarded
fluctuated with no clear trend until the early 2000s when it also began to rise
slowly. Again, however, this increase was modest compared to the increase in R&D
expenditures.
In Figure 3 we shift the focus to measures of research output, graphing the
growth in numbers of publications and citations for our sample institutions. As in
Figure 2, we have plotted each series as an index with 1990 set equal to 100, and we
have included the indexes for federally-funded and total R&D expenditures for
comparison. It is apparent that academic chemistry publications and citations
increased much more rapidly than did funding in this period. The index of
publication numbers increases consistently and reaches a value of 268 by 2009,

14
nearly a threefold increase. Meanwhile the index of citations to these publications
grows even more quickly, achieving a value of 422 in 2008 (the last year for which
we can calculate a three-year citation count).
The relationships in Figure 3 can be compared with those reported by Adams
and Griliches (1998, p. 136). They found that between 1981 and 1993 publications
and R&D expenditures in chemistry increased at very nearly the same rate; both
increasing approximately 50 percent. Thus there appears to be a change in the
knowledge production function at aggregate level for the chemistry fields in the
more recent period.
The data on outputs and expenditures shown in Figure 3 make it clear that at
the aggregate level the cost per publication was declining over time. In Figures 4
and 5, we use the university-level data to look more closely at the relationship
between inputs and outputs over time. Dividing total chemistry R&D expenditures
at each institution by the number of chemistry publications attributed to that
institution yields an average cost per publication. Figure 4 plots the mean and
median of the resulting distribution in each year. Both measures fell appreciably
between 1990 and 1998 then leveled off. The median fell from just under $60,000
per article to around $30,000 per article. The divergence between the mean and the
median reflects the impact of a few extremely high-cost universities, and the
convergence of these two measures over time suggests that costs per publication
were becoming somewhat less skewed over time.
In Figure 5 we compare the median cost of publications across subsets of
universities defined by their research intensity and control (i.e., public or private).

15
In each group the time trends are similar and the differences in levels appear
reasonable: costs are lowest at the more research-intensive universities and the
public universities. Perhaps of greater interest, however, is the apparent
convergence of costs across the different groups over time. Median costs fell much
more sharply at less research-intensive and private universities producing a
considerable convergence of costs by the late 1990s. Costs per publication appear
to have risen again at the non-Research I universities during the early 2000s, but
then began to fall after the early 2000s.

Knowledge Production and Research Funding at the University Level
As a rule, universities produce new scientific knowledge by combining labor
(faculty, postdoctoral researchers, graduate students), with capital (buildings,
laboratories, infrastructure, and specialized equipment), and other purchased
inputs. While faculty salaries are supported primarily from institutional sources,
support for postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, and most purchased inputs
comes primarily from externally-sponsored research funding from either federal or
non-federal sources. Structures and other long-lived capital equipment used in
knowledge production may be treated as an institution-specific fixed effect.8
Formally, we can express this relationship in the following knowledge production
function:
(1)

yit = f(t , Lit-1 , Rfit-1, Rnit-1, i,)

Where i indexes institutions, t denotes time periods, L is faculty labor input, Rf and
Rn denote, respectively, federal and non-federal funding,  is an institution specific

16
effect, and  is included to capture technical changes (and other factors) that are
common across all universities at a point in time. The time subscripts on the input
variables are all denoted as t-1 to reflect the fact that there is typically a time lag
between the input of resources and the publication of research results.9
Theory offers no guidance about the specific functional form that the
relationship in equation (1) takes. In what follows, we estimate a simple linear
approximation to this function:
(2)

yit = i + t + fRfit-1 +nRnit-1 + Lit-1 +it

where  is a stochastic error term that is assumed to be independently distributed
over time for each institution. In our estimation we use faculty numbers and
research funding from the prior year. It is certainly true that some publications are
the result of efforts expended much longer than one year ago, but research
expenditures and faculty numbers are highly serially correlated and
experimentation with a number of different approaches to approximating the
production lags all yield quite similar results.10
We measure knowledge outputs in two ways. The first is a simple count of
the number of publications in year t that are attributed to the institution based on
the affiliations recorded for each author.11 The second counts the number of
citations that articles published in year t receive during a three-year window
beginning in the publication year.12 To the extent that citations may be interpreted
as a reflection of the significance of each publication, we can treat the citation count
as a relative quality adjusted measure of knowledge production.13

17
OLS Fixed Effect Results
We begin by reporting OLS estimates of equation (2). Table 3 reports
coefficient estimates for the key explanatory variables in equation (2) for three
dependent variables: the number of publications, the number of citations received
by those publications, and the average number of citations per publication. For both
total publications and citations, the coefficients on both lagged federal and nonfederal funding are positive, statistically and economically significant, and of
approximately the same size. Since the funding variable is measured in $1000s,
they imply that an additional $1 million in funding results in between 6 and 7 more
publications in the following year, and 60 to 70 more citations to those publications.
This implies a marginal cost per publication in the range of $150,000. For
comparison it is worth noting that in the previous section we found that the average
cost per publication fell from around $80,000 in 1990 to about $40,000 by the early
2000s. Given the relatively small changes in the number of full-time faculty in the
years being considered, it is not surprising that the coefficient on this variable is
consistently small and statistically insignificant. Any effects of faculty size must be
absorbed in the university fixed effects or in variations in the scale of funding.
Overall, the model does a reasonably good job of accounting for the observed
patterns of variation in publications and citations, explaining over half of the
observed variation in the dependent variables. It should be pointed out that this is
not simply a result of cross-sectional variation across institutions, as the R-squared
values for within variation are also relatively high, indicating that temporal

18
variations in funding at a university account for a good deal of the temporal
variation in research output.
The third specification, which examines the relationship between research
funding and the average number of citations per publication, allows us to consider
whether there is an effect of funding on the quality of publications independent of
their quantity. As the estimates for this dependent variable indicate, none of the
included explanatory variables contributes significantly to the average publication
quality.
In Table 4 we disaggregate the sample of universities to explore whether the
effects of funding on knowledge production vary by control (public vs. private) or
research intensity (Carnegie Research I institutions vs. non-Research I institutions).
The effects of federal R&D funding are statistically significant across all of the
different subsets, and while the point estimates vary somewhat, the differences in
these coefficients are not large enough to be significant. In contrast, there is marked
variation in the effects of non-federal research funds. For both private universities
and non-Research I institutions, non-federal funds appear to have a much smaller
effect and one that is not significantly different from zero. For the average number
of citations per publication, the effects of funding in the disaggregated regressions
remain small in magnitude, however, there is a small, positive, and statistically
significant effect on average citations for public universities and for the nonResearch I universities.
In Figure 6 we have plotted the estimated year effects (t ) which measure
technological change for each subset of universities, along with the results for the

19
full sample. These estimates indicate that a technological shock improved chemistry
productivity starting in the 1990s. The rising numbers of publications and citations
to those publications was common across all of the different categories of
universities we consider. However, the number of publications produced and the
number of citations to those publications grew considerably more at the Research I
universities than the non-Research I universities. Trends in the number of
publications were quite similar between public and private universities, but the
number of citations received grew more rapidly at the private universities than at
the public ones. The difference was not enough, however, to cause any meaningful
variation in the time trends of average citations per publication.
Because all of the explanatory variables used in the regressions reported in
Tables 3 and 4 are lagged relative to the dependent variable, they are temporally
exogenous. These regressions confirm that there is a positive and relatively strong
association between both the quantity of federal and non-federal R&D funding an
institution receives and the subsequent production of chemical knowledge.
Moreover, the relative similarity of the effect sizes across different categories of
universities suggests that there is no apparent inefficiency in the distribution of
funding between public and private or between more and less research-intensive
institutions. These results should be reassuring to funders supporting chemical
research as they indicate an effective allocation of funds.

20
Instrumental Variable Estimation
The OLS results are not sufficient to fully identify the causal effects of funding
on knowledge production. While it is not possible for future publications to directly
cause past funding, these two variables may be related through a third, and
unobserved variable. In particular we know that funding is allocated purposefully.
Thus, investigators with more promising research programs may be more likely to
be successful both in seeking funding and in publishing their research results. If this
is the case, then the positive correlations revealed by the OLS regressions could
simply reflect this unobserved variation in investigator quality, which is positively
selected by universities in our sample.
Put somewhat differently, the OLS results are not sufficient to answer the
policy-relevant question: how would the quantity of knowledge produced change if
an additional $1 million was allocated to chemistry research? Ideally, to answer this
question we would want an experimental setting in which additional research funds
could be randomly assigned to some universities and not to others. By comparing
the impact of funds on the treatment and control groups we could identify the
impact of additional research funding on scientific output. We cannot conduct such
an experiment, but we can use instrumental variables to obtain estimates of the
effects of such truly random variations in funding levels
The requirement for a good instrumental variable is that it be correlated with
the explanatory variable of interest, but uncorrelated with the error term. There are
a number of candidate instruments available that we can employ. After exploring a
number of possible candidates we settled on three: federally funded R&D

21
expenditures for math and physics research, non-federally funded R&D
expenditures for math and physics research, and the fall student enrollment
numbers. The first two of these instruments should capture important variations in
the larger funding environment as well as more institution specific effects such as
major fundraising campaigns or faculty recruitment efforts that increase a
university’s overall research competitiveness. The last instrument is included to
capture effects of tuition revenue as a source of faculty recruitment that should be
associated with changes in levels. A priori, there is no reason to expect that any of
these instruments should be correlated with random shocks in the quality of
research funding proposals submitted by chemistry faculty at an institution.
Table 5 reports the first stage regression results from the two stage
instrumental variable panel regressions for each of the two endogenous explanatory
variables—federally-funded chemistry R&D expenditures, and non-federally-funded
chemistry R&D expenditures. Overall, the model appears to do a good job of
accounting for variation in the endogenous variables, and we see a strong positive
effect of enrollment in both equations, while each of the math and physics
expenditure variables exerts a strong positive effect in the regression for the
corresponding chemistry variable. The F statistics in Table 5 indicate that we do not
have a problem with weak instruments.
In Table 6 we report the second stage coefficient estimates for the knowledge
production function for the full sample and for each subset of institutions. Given the
poor fit of the OLS regressions for the average number of citations per article, we
have dropped this variable from the IV analysis and focus only on publications and

22
citations received. For the full sample, we find that the effect of federally funded
R&D expenditures has increased by a factor of approximately 3 for publications and
3.5 for citations. On the other hand, the effect of non-federally funded R&D
expenditures has fallen substantially in magnitude and is no longer statistically
significant for either publications or citations. The Sargan-Hansen statistic indicates
that we cannot reject the null hypothesis of over-identified instruments.
Results are broadly consistent across the different categories of institutions
we have identified, although coefficient magnitudes vary. When we split the sample
between private and public institutions, the effect of federally-funded R&D
expenditures is larger for private universities (for both publications and citations),
and we find that public universities’ non-federally funded R&D expenditures do
have a positive and significant, though significantly weaker, effect on research
outputs. Given the low level of non-federal R&D expenditures at private
universities, it is hardly surprising to find that this category of research funding has
no effect for them. When the sample is split between Research I and non-Research I
universities, the effect of federally-funded R&D expenditures is much weaker for
both subsets of universities than it is for the whole sample and is statistically
significant only for the non-Research I universities. This suggests that much of the
effect observed in the full sample is coming from variations in the level of federally
funded R&D expenditures and research outputs between the two groups, rather
than within either group.
The year effects, which measure the impact of technological change from the
instrumental variable regressions, are summarized in Figure 7. Once again we see

23
that there remains a significant unexplained positive time trend for both
publications and citations. This growth is most pronounced for the Research I
universities, and weakest for the non-Research I institutions. As was true in the OLS
regressions, the trend growth was also larger for private universities than for the
publics.

Discussion
Two results emerge from the regressions described in this section. The first
is confirmation of a positive relationship between research funding and knowledge
production, whether measured by raw publication numbers or weighting
publications by the number of citations that they receive. Universities that receive
more funding produce more articles and receive more citations to those articles.
While the OLS results cannot demonstrate a causal effect of funding on knowledge
production, they do confirm that the purposeful allocation of funding across
institutions does correspond to the presence of more productive investigators who
make collectively larger contributions to chemical knowledge. The IV estimates
suggest that there is a causal effect of funding on knowledge production, at least for
federal funding. If true, this implies that the marginal effect of increased funding
would be relatively large. Using the coefficients from the full sample, they imply
that an additional $1 million would lead to the publication of 19 more articles and
an additional 260 citations to those articles. This places the marginal cost of an
additional article (a bit more than $50,000) roughly in line with the average cost per
article across all institutions.

24
The second striking result to emerge from our analysis is the rapid growth in
knowledge production in chemistry over the 20 years from 1990 through 2009. At
the moment this increase appears in our analysis as a residual time effect. In other
words, it is unexplained by any of the measurable input variables, but can be
considered a proxy for technological change (Solow 1957). Compared to the
analysis in Adams and Griliches (1998) for the 1980s, this appears to be a departure
from past experience. Given the coincidence of its timing with the spread of
automatic laboratory data collection and analysis using personal computers and the
internet, it is possible that the growth in the number of articles published relative to
measured inputs reflects an IT mediated increase in the efficiency of academic
chemistry. Alternatively, given the greater emphasis on publications and
bibliometric measures of influence, it is possible that rising numbers of publications
and citations to those publications reflect changes in the ethos of academic
chemistry that have reduced the knowledge content of individual publications.
Lacking a direct measure of the knowledge contributions of individual articles, we
cannot at present distinguish between these alternative mechanisms or apportion
the sources of the increase between them.

Conclusion
In light of the substantial investments made by both federal and non-federal sources
in supporting university R&D activities, it is quite reasonable to wonder whether
these investments are productive. Only a few previous studies have sought to
elucidate these relationships. Several have focused on the level of individual

25
investigators and grants, a perspective that we believe neglects significant spillover
effects across researchers. As we have argued, we believe that it is most
appropriate to consider relationships at the level of the discipline and to
concentrate on aggregate and institution-level variations.
As we have shown here, for the case of academic chemistry, analysis at this
level yields important insights about knowledge production and its relationship to
sponsored research funding from both federal and non-federal sources. While we
have documented the fact that funding goes to those institutions that are most
productive, and that there appears to be a causal effect of funding on subsequent
knowledge production, we have also documented a puzzling increase in scholarly
output among academic chemists in the years we have selected for study. This
suggests that technological change may have shifted the production function,
increasing the federal government’s return on investment. Resolving the sources of
this increase will require further effort to refine measurements of the knowledge
embodied in academic publications.

26
DATA Appendix

The analysis in this paper rests on merging several different sources of data. We
describe the sources and key characteristics of each briefly.

Research & Development Expenditures
These data are derived from the National Science Foundation’s Survey of
Research and Development Expenditures at Universities and Colleges/Higher
Education Research and Development Survey (http://webcaspar.nsf.gov). Data are
available annually since 1973 for total and federally funded R&D expenditures by
discipline. They are obtained from survey responses completed by institutions of
higher education, which are responsible for classifying all research expenditures by
discipline. We computed non-federally funded R&D expenditures as the difference
between total and federally funded R&D expenditures.
Sample institutions were selected from the universe of institutions
represented in this data by summing real federally funded R&D expenditures (in
prices of 2000) for chemistry and chemical engineering between 1990 and 2009
and then ranking institutions in descending order. We initially selected the top 150
institutions but were obliged to drop three of these from the analysis because of
inconsistencies in coverage. Before adopting this sampling strategy, we examined
several other rankings, using total R&D expenditures and using nominal rather than
real expenditures. The lists produced in each case were quite similar.

27
Institutions report these data for the fiscal year corresponding most closely
to the federal fiscal year. In most cases this is likely to run from July of one year to
June of the following calendar year. Data are labeled with the calendar year in
which the fiscal year ends. Hence data for 2009 most likely cover expenditures from
July 2008 through June 2009.
In addition to the expenditures data, this source also contains information on
type of control (private or public) and standardized Carnegie Classifications that we
use to categorize university types.

Graduate Students, Doctorates Awarded and Postdoctoral Researchers
These data are derived from the National Science Foundation and National
Institutes of Health Survey of Graduate Students and Postdoctorates in Science and
Engineering (graduate student survey) which is conducted annually by the National
Center for Science and Engineering Statistics. The survey is conducted in the fall
semester of each academic year and data are collected at the department level.
These data are available from http://webcaspar.nsf.gov .
The level of institutional detail provided in this survey is greater than in the
R&D expenditure data. In the latter survey a number of multi-campus state systems
report a single aggregated number. To link the data sets, we were obliged to
aggregate the data in the student survey to match the level of aggregation of the
R&D data.

28
Publications and Citations
Publication and citation data were computed by Thomson Reuters, Research
Analytics from the data underlying the Web of Science publication and citation
database. Thomson Reuters subject area experts categorize journals into subject
classes based on detailed analysis of the content and focus of the journals. Our
research began with the full set of journals that Thomson Reuters categorizes as
Chemistry and Chemical Engineering. We also conducted an analysis of all journal
titles indexed by Thomson Reuters and added a small number of additional journals
that contain significant chemistry content.
We then worked closely with Thomson Reuters staff to match publications by
author affiliation to universities in our sample. In addition to institution name, we
considered city, state and zip code information associated with authors to verify the
accuracy of article linkages.
After verifying the full list of publications, Thomson Reuters analyzed them
to produce summary statistics describing the number of publications each year
produced by each institution, the number of citations that those publications
received in 3 and 5 year windows beginning with the publication year, and a variety
of other citation related metrics.

Fall Student Enrollment
These data come from the IPEDS Enrollment Survey and were downloaded from
http://webcaspar.nsf.gov . The original source is the Higher Education General
Information Survey (HEGIS) and the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data

29
System (IPEDS) that is conducted by the Department of Education's National Center
for Education Statistics (NCES).

A recent National Science and Technology Council (2008, pp. 6, 14) report, for

example, observes: “The pragmatic reality facing Federal agencies is that the
resources available for investing in research are limited…” and argues that there is a
need for more systematic, quantitative models relating funding inputs to a variety of
significant scientific outputs.
2

Although it remains unpublished, work by Arora and Gambardella (1998) adopts a

similar methodology in examining the effects of grants from the National Science
Foundation’s (NSF) Economics program. Like Jacob and Lefgren, they find a
relatively modest effect of funding on subsequent productivity, although this effect
varies by researcher seniority.
3

From 1998 to 2004, NSF R&D obligations increased from $2.3 billion to $3.8

billion, measured in current dollars. While not as impressive at the increase in NIH
budgets, this represents a significant infusion of funding and a departure from the
relatively stable funding in the years before and after these dates (NSF Survey of
Federal Funds for Research and Development; http://webcaspar.nsf.gov; accessed
9/25/2014).
4

To illustrate this point, of the 150 institutions we initially examined, there were

102 chemical engineering departments that reported faculty numbers in the
American Chemical Society directory and 48 that did not. However, only 22
institutions reported zero amounts of federally funded R&D expenditures for
chemical engineering research in every year, and there are no institutions for which

33

Web of Science recorded zero chemical engineering publications in all years. The
mismatch in classification across the different sources used in our analysis suggests
that attempting to analyze these fields separately would likely cause more problems
than it solves. Numerically, chemistry accounts for the bulk of publications, R&D
expenditures and faculty, and results that are restricted to chemistry look similar to
those we report below. Results for chemical engineering resemble in sign and
magnitude the results for chemistry, but effects are not significant, possibly because
of the smaller sample and likely discrepancies in classification across the different
data sources.
5

The three institutions dropped from our sample included two academic medical

centers—the University of California San Francisco and the University of Texas M.D.
Anderson Cancer Center—which reported no chemistry faculty, graduate students
or postdocs for much of the study period, and the Oregon Institute of Science and
Technology, which disappears from the data after 2001.
6

Additional details on the construction of the dataset used in our analysis are

provided in the appendix to this paper.
7

Aggregate faculty numbers were essentially constant over these 20 years. We are

in the process of hand collecting data from biannual faculty directories produced by
the American Chemical Society, but because individual departments are not
represented in all years, the data are not yet of sufficient quality to be reported here.
Nonetheless, we can rule out the possibility that there was any significant increase
in aggregate faculty numbers.

34

For additional discussion of approaches to modeling knowledge production

functions, see Hare and Wyatt (1988). de Groot (1991), which seeks to estimate
university cost function, is also relevant.
9

For a somewhat different approach to modeling knowledge production, which

accounts for the joint production of publications and graduate student training, see
Apon et al (2014), who use a stochastic frontier production function model.
10

Initially we had hoped to directly estimate the lag-structure of the relationship by

including multiple years of lagged inputs on the right hand side of the equation. It
became apparent, however, that these variables were highly collinear, making it
impossible to precisely estimate their separate effects. When it became clear that
we could not use this strategy, we experimented with a number of ad hoc
specifications, including the average levels of inputs over the previous five years, a
declining sum of the previous five years’ inputs, and an inverted V weighting
structure. All produced essentially the same results as a one-period lag.
11

The vast majority of articles in our data have authors with only one institutional

affiliation. However, when the authors of an article have affiliations with more than
one institution, we credit each institution with the publication. Because there was a
small increase in the number of multi-affiliation articles over time, this approach
introduces a small upward bias into the time trend, but it can account at most for an
increase of perhaps 5-10% in the total number of articles over the period.
12

Increasing the citation window to five years yields very similar results.

13

We say “relative” quality because, as noted earlier, the average number of

citations per article increased substantially between 1990 and 2009, which we

35

interpret as a change in citation practices that may reflect the greater visibility of
publications as a result of the movement toward electronic publication and
distribution. Thus, the absolute number of citations is unlikely to reflect the
absolute quality of an article, but it will still provide evidence about the relative
quality of articles published at the same time.
