    "abstract": "\n\nArtificial intelligence may greatly increase the efficiency of the existing economy. But it may have an even larger impact by serving as a new general-purpose \u201cmethod of invention\u201d that can reshape the nature of the innovation process and the organization of R&D.  We distinguish between automation-oriented applications such as robotics and the potential for recent developments in \u201cdeep learning\u201d to serve as a general-purpose method of invention, finding strong evidence of a \u201cshift\u201d in the importance of application-oriented learning research since 2009. We suggest that this is likely to lead to a significant substitution away from more routinized labor-intensive research towards research that takes advantage of the interplay between passively generated large datasets and enhanced prediction algorithms.  At the same time, the potential commercial rewards from mastering this mode of research are likely to usher in a period of racing, driven by powerful incentives for individual companies to acquire and control critical large datasets and application-specific algorithms.  We suggest that policies which encourage transparency and sharing of core datasets across both public and private actors may be critical tools for stimulating research productivity and innovation-oriented competition going forward.\n\n",
