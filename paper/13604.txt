ABSTRACT
The biotechnology industry has been an engine of innovation for the U.S. healthcare system and, more
generally, the U.S. economy. It is by far the most research intensive industry in the U.S. In our analyses
in the current paper, for example, we find that, over the past 25 years, average R&D intensity (R&D
spending to total firm assets) for this industry was 38 percent. Consider that over this same period
average R&D intensity for all industries was only about 3 percent.
In the current paper we examine this industry along a number of dimensions and estimate its average
financial risk. Specifically, we use Compustat and Center for Research in Securities Prices (CRSP)
data from 1982 to 2005 for firms defined by the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)
as biotechnology firms to estimate several Fama-French three factor return models. The finance literature
has established this model as the gold standard. Single factor models like the Capital Asset Pricing
Model (CAPM) do not capture all of the types of systematic risk that influence firm cost of capital.
In particular, the CAPM does not reflect the empirical evidence that supports both a size-related and
a book-to-market related systematic risk factor . Both of these factors, based on biotech industry characteristics,
will exert a greater influence on biotech firms, on average. Another implication is, of course, that cost
of capital estimates for the industry will be underestimated when a single factor model, like the CAPM,
is used. This also implies that the cost estimates of bringing a new drug and/or biologic to market will
be understated if financial risk and cost of capital are measured using a single-factor model.
In the current study we find that biotechnology firms are exposed to greater financial risk than other
industries and are also more sensitive to policy shocks that affect, or could affect, industry profitability.
Average nominal costs of capital over the 1982-2005 time period were 16.25 percent for biotechnology
firms. Of course, these average estimates obscure significant variation in financial risk at the firm level,
but nonetheless shed light on some interesting aggregate differences in risk. In the current paper we
discuss the theoretical links between financial risk, stock prices and returns, and R&D spending. Several
caveats are also discussed.

Introduction
Most debates in the United States over the cost of drug development, industry

profits, or current drug prices will, at one point or another, mention the risk associated
with pharmaceutical research and development (R&D). Most people interpret this to
mean the likelihood a potential drug will successfully advance through all the stages of
development: discovery, clinical development (phases I through III), and then ultimately
gain FDA approval for marketing. By some estimates, only 1 out of every 10,000
investigational new drugs (INDs), which are new molecules at the earliest stages of drug
research, ever make it to the market. This type of risk is referred to as technical risk and,
for pharmaceuticals, has often been compared to drilling for oil (i.e., “wildcatting”)
because there are many “dry holes” and only a few “gushers.”
This type of risk, which is also referred to as idiosyncratic or unique risk, is not
the type of risk investors typically focus on when they discuss risk in the pharmaceutical
and biotechnology industries. This is because technical risk can be eliminated through
diversification; specifically, it can be completely eliminated by holding a stock portfolio
that mimics the stock market as a whole—the so-called market portfolio. Therefore, the
type of risk investors, i.e. firm owners, care about is the risk they cannot diversify away;
this is called financial, or systematic, risk. This type of risk plays an important role in
firm R&D spending decisions because it, not technical risk, determines the cost of R&D
finance to the firm. The higher the cost of R&D finance, the more promising an R&D
project must be for it to represent a good investment for the firm’s shareholder. In the
current paper we study this type of risk within the pharmaceutical and biotechnology
industries.

The biotechnology industry (first) and the pharmaceutical industry (second) are
the two most research intensive industries in the United States1. We analyze and compare
the financial characteristics and financial risk of these industries using contemporary
models from the finance literature. To date, the relatively young biotechnology industry
has not been studied as much as the pharmaceutical industry, at least with respect to
financial risk and R&D spending decisions. These two industries have important
structural and financial differences; yet they are often lumped together and treated as one
in debates and policy formulation. Indeed, while they do share many similarities they also
have important differences. For example, most large pharmaceutical companies finance
their R&D projects with cash flows generated from existing product sales.

Most

biotechnology firms, in contrast, have yet to bring a product to market; thus, they must
rely on external funding (usually equity financing via the issuance of new shares of stock)
to finance their R&D projects (Vernon, 2005). Recognizing the biotech industry’s unique
challenges and differentiating characteristics is especially important when assessing the
impact of new government polices, which we will discuss later in the paper.
To begin, in studying the financial risk associated with the biotechnology
industry, the pharmaceutical industry makes a good benchmark for comparison because it
is a major competitor-partner to the biotechnology industry and because the next closest
industry, in terms of research and development (R&D) spending intensity, is Computer
Software. The biotech industry is the most R&D intensive major industry in the U.S., the
pharmaceutical industry is next. The average R&D intensity (R&D spending to total firm
assets) for the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries was 38 percent and 25

1

Admittedly, there are numerous issues underpinning this dichotomous classification; we discuss these in
the paper.

5

percent respectively and computer software is third, at about 50 percent less intensive
(based on R&D to total firm assets). Therefore, it makes sense to compare the biotech
industry with the pharmaceutical industry, its closest rival and often-times partner. We
show that these two industries are similar in many ways; however, the biotechnology
industry is populated by smaller firms that spend more intensively on R&D, and for this
and other reasons we will discuss, we find empirically they face greater financial risk,
have higher R&D capital costs, and are more sensitive to policy shocks that affect
expected future profitability—particularly with respect to government regulatory events
aimed at constraining prices in the U.S.
The financial health of most biotechnology firms is more fragile because, as
previously mentioned, they typically must rely on capital raised in the financial markets
to fund their new and ongoing R&D projects. Pharmaceutical companies, in contrast, rely
almost exclusively on internally-generated cash flows to fund R&D projects (Grabowski
and Vernon, 1987; Vernon, 2003, 2005). The presence of capital market imperfections
for R&D finance imparts a cost advantage to internally-generated funds over external
debt and equity; thus, even holding constant financial risk and the required rate of return
on new equity issues, biotech firms with no cash flows are at a financing disadvantage.
This and several other significant factors affecting financial risk will be discussed and
analyzed.
Our paper will proceed as follows. Section II will describe the data sample,
discuss how firms are classified as pharmaceutical or biotechnology firms, and
summarize a number of key financial characteristics and time series trends that
distinguish biotechnology firms from their more traditional counterparts in the

6

pharmaceutical industry. Section III will present empirical estimates and comparisons of
financial risk for these industries and discuss the cost of capital implications for firmlevel investment in R&D. To do this we employ the well-known Fama-French Three
Factor Model (Fama and French, 1993), which is the preferred model in the empirical
finance literature. This section will also discuss the financial risk and R&D investment
implications of unexpected government regulatory announcements and shocks, i.e.,
changes in the probability of future regulatory events or polices. A simple framework for
R&D project investment decision-making will be presented to illuminate the fundamental
links between policy shocks, financial risk, and R&D investment. Section IV will
conclude.

II.

Data Sample and Financial Comparisons

To be included in our sample, a firm must be publicly traded and have data
available on both Compustat and Center for Research on Securities Prices (CRSP)
databases. Compustat contains financial statement data and CRSP contains stock return
data, both are necessary for the measures estimated in this study. Therefore, the samples
used to estimate all of the measures are consistent across all measures. For the
pharmaceutical sample, we select all of the firms that have a Standard Industrial
Classification (SIC) code of 2834, as recorded in the Compustat database. Similarly, for
the biotechnology sample, we select all of the firms that have a Standard Industrial
Classification (SIC) code of 2836.
For each firm in each sample, we match its Compustat data to its available CRSP
data. Firms with Compustat data but no CRSP data are excluded. This means that some
7

small public firms that are not part of either CRSP or Compustat are excluded. This also
means that many private firms (usually small) are excluded from the study. Nonetheless,
most firms with a significant product under patent, in trials, or FDA approved, go public
because they can sell stock to help finance their R&D. Private firms are often not this
“advanced.” For this reason, we believe that our results accurately represent the financial
characteristics and risks of the two industries2. If we were able to add private firms to the
sample, the most likely effect on the results would be that the average firm size would
fall somewhat and the average risk level increase because private firms are typically
small and have tighter financial constraints than publicly traded firms. The samples,
however, are not static over time. New firms enter the industry, other firms exit, and
some firms merge. As figure 1 illustrates, the number of firms in both industries has
grown considerably since the early 1980s, with only a few years seeing the number of
firms decline.

Note that the starting year is 1982. This is the first year in which there are more
than a handful of biotechnology firms (there were 9 firms in 1982). The pharmaceutical
industry has about 30 established firms going back further, but to make proper

As seen in Figures 2 and 3, average firm total assets and average firm sales for the
biotechnology sample are quite small; in fact, for many firms in this group, sales were
nonexistent. This is why many biotech firms must rely on external equity markets for
financing their R&D. As noted in the first section of the paper, this is in direct contrast to
most large, established pharmaceutical firms, which have substantial cash flows and
liquidity reserves. The academic finance and economics literatures have shown that
internal and external funds in research intensive industries are not perfect substitutes:
internal funds have a lower cost of capital relative to external funds when capital market

9

imperfections exist. This has been found to be particularly true in the pharmaceutical and
biotechnology industries. Vernon (2005) discusses the capital market imperfections
hypothesis with respect to these industries and provides several key references3. The
theoretical rationale for these imperfections is grounded on arguments having to do with
asymmetric information, transaction costs, principal-agent problems, financial gearing,
and other factors. These issues, as will soon be seen, are not unrelated to the analyses
undertaken and discussed in the following section of this paper.
Figures 4 and 5 reflect average R&D spending and total industry R&D spending
for both samples, respectively.

R&D spending has grown steadily overtime with

biotechnology firms spending less than pharmaceutical firms.

Next, we consider a standardized measure of R&D spending by firms. Figure 6
deflates average R&D spending by total firm assets. We do not standardize by sales
because many biotechnology firms have little or no sales; however, they do have assets.
A standardized measure is often more revealing because it measures the intensity of a

10

firms behavior, for example R&D spending behavior, while abstracting from the size
differences across firms or industries. The standardized measures also control for
inflation. Inflation reduces the real value of dollar amounts over time, making
comparisons of dollar amounts across time less reliable. The ratio of two dollar amounts
eliminates this problem, so the measures compared across time can be interpreted are real
changes in firm behavior as opposed to simple dollar inflation. Indeed, much of the recent
economics and finance literatures exploring firm investment behavior in these industries
use intensity measures in their empirical work (Vernon, 2005; Golec, Hegde, and Vernon,
2006; Giaccotto, Santerre, and Vernon, 2005; and many of the earlier research cited in
these recent studies). For comparative reasons, we also include average R&D spending
for all industries in Figure 6. This highlights the relatively high research intensity of the
biotech and pharmaceutical industries.

Both Biotech and pharmaceutical firms are R&D intensive, and both have become
more intensive over time. Biotechnology averages 38 cents in R&D spending for each
dollar of assets compared with about 25 cents for pharmaceuticals and 3 cents for all

11

industries. Note also biotechnology R&D intensity is most volatile, pharmaceuticals are
also rather volatile, while all industries is fairly stable. Both the biotechnology and
pharmaceutical industries experienced significant drops in R&D intensity around 19911993. It was during this time that the Clinton administration was unveiling their proposed
Health Security Act, which included a major new regulation of U.S. drug prices through a
Council on Breakthrough Drugs—we discuss this later as it serves as a relevant policy
shock from which we can analyze and compare its effect on abnormal stock returns and
subsequent R&D spending.
Finally, Figures 7 and 8 compare average net incomes in the two industries, in
both absolute dollars and deflated by total firm assets.

Because sales are sparse for most biotech firms, net income is usually low or
negative. Biotechnology firms rely partly on partnerships and milestone payments, often
from pharmaceutical companies for income. Our investigation of industry cash flows also
reflected these patterns (cash flow equals net income plus depreciation and depletion
expenses). How, then, do biotechnology firms survive under these conditions? In brief,
they must raise capital in the capital markets—mostly by selling equity. By comparison,

12

the average pharmaceutical company has been buying back its stock and retiring its debt
(hence the negative financing flows we observed in the data).
Given the existence of capital market imperfections and the higher cost of capital
associated with external capital relative to internal cash flows, biotechnology firms face
greater challenges in financing ongoing and new R&D projects than the average large
pharmaceutical firm. As will be shown, this means that biotechnology firms face greater
financial risk, and their R&D portfolios will be even more sensitive to exposure to
political and regulatory risk, especially with respect to policy shocks affecting the
likelihood of such events as price controls or more stringent regulation.

III.

Estimates of Financial Risk: Fama-French Three Factor Model

We now turn to the measures of financial risk as reflected in the stock prices and
returns of the firms in each sample. The most widely-used finance model of risk and
return was developed by Fama and French (1993). The characteristics of the stocks are
measured by estimating the following three-factor return model for each stock over its
available CRSP stock return data.

( Rit − R ft ) = α i + β im ( Rmt − R ft ) + β is SMLt + β ih HMLt + ε it ,

(1)

where for each trading day t, Rit is stock i’s return, Rft is the risk-free return, Rmt is the
CRSP value-weighted stock index return, SMLt is the size factor, and HMLt is the bookto-market factor, α is the alpha, βm is the beta (market factor loading), βs is the size factor
loading, βh is the book-to-market factor loading, and εt is a residual error term. The

13

parameters are measured separately for each firm i. and then averaged over the particular
sample. The factor data are taken from Kenneth French’s (2007) website.
Note that this model measures three sources of systematic risk for each firm. βm
measures a firm’s general stock market-related risk (more risk implies firm’s return
moves closely with the market), βs measures a firm’s size-related risk (smaller firms
typically have more risk), and βh measures a firm’s risk due to a stock price premium
over equity book value (larger premium, more risk). Unsystematic, or idiosyncratic, risk
is measured by the standard deviation of εt.
The levels of systematic risks for a firm are important because they determine the
firm’s cost of capital. All else equal, the larger a firm’s factor loadings, the larger its
systematic risks and cost of capital. βm measures a firm’s market-related risk. One can
think of this as the degree to which a firm’s stock returns vary with the return of the
general stock market. The general stock market return is driven by general economic
conditions such as growth in gross national product, hence, βm measures how sensitive a
firm’s business is to the general economy.
βs measures a firm’s size-related risk. This is the degree to which a firm’s stock

returns vary with the difference in returns between a portfolio of small stocks and large
stocks. This is thought to measure risk typically faced by small companies. But note that
not all small (large) companies will have a large (small) βs. Some large companies may
actually have some of the financial characteristics of small companies. For example,
small companies often have high growth rates and this could be one reason they are risky.
Occasionally, a large firm will grow fast too, so it may have a large βs.

14

βh measures a firm’s book-to-market-related risk. This is the degree to which a

firm’s stock returns vary with the difference in returns between a portfolio of high bookto-market ratios and low book-to-market ratios. The book-to-market ratio is the ratio of a
firm’s book value of equity to stock market value of equity. This is thought to measure
financial distress risk. A high book-to-market ratio implies that although the firm has
significant common equity listed in its financial statements, the stock market value of the
equity is relatively low. This is a signal that stock market investors believe the firm’s
assets have little value, and the firm has a greater probability of experiencing financial
distress.
Tables 1 reports results from our estimation of the Fama and French three-factor
model for the pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms in our two samples. For
comparison, we list the statistics for the risk factor loadings for all industries, the
computer industry, and the automobile industry as estimated by Fama and French (1997)
in their analysis of costs of capital for 48 different industries. Note that Fama and
French’s data covered an earlier period of time (1963-1994) and used wider definitions of
industries than our definitions for pharmaceuticals and biotechnology. Nevertheless, their
estimates offer reasonable benchmarks with which to compare our estimates.

On average, as the results in Table 1 show, biotechnology firms are riskier than
pharmaceutical firms on all measures. For example, the size-related factor loadings differ
(0.80 vs. 1.13) because biotech firms are smaller, on average, than pharmaceutical firms.
This implies that biotech firms should have to pay a 1.3 percent higher cost of equity
capital than pharmaceutical firms, holding everything else constant. When all factors are
considered simultaneously and using average factor values from the entire 1927-2005
time period, the nominal cost of capital for the average pharmaceutical firms is 14.5
percent compared to 16.25 percent for biotech companies. These reflect industry
averages, but individual firms within each industry will have significantly different costs
of capital.
Note that both the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have considerably
more size-related risk than the average of all industries, the computer industry, and the
automobile industry. Conversely, the automobile industry has a larger price-to-book
factor loading, making them more risky on that dimension. Therefore, the cost of capital
for the average computer firm is only about 9.18 percent, while for the average
automobile firm it is 16.10 percent. For the average firm across all industries, the cost of
capital is 14.05 percent. If we had data on private biotechnology firms, adding them to
our biotechnology sample would likely increase average cost of capital for the

16

biotechnology sample because private firms are typically small and they would have
large size risk (βs).

Effects of Clinton’s Health Security Act (HSA) on Biotechnology Firms Compared to
Pharmaceutical Firms

We have shown that the theoretical risk measures for biotechnology firms are
larger than for pharmaceutical firms. Now we test to see if, when a risk appears,
biotechnology firm stock valuations (reflecting their underlying intangible assets’ values)
suffer even more than pharmaceutical stock prices. Data necessary to estimate individual
firm’s factor risks in the factor model come from 1991 and the abnormal returns
illustrated, which are returns after adjusting for firm risk levels, come from the 19921993 period.

Figures 9 and 10 below show the returns for the portfolios of

pharmaceutical and biotechnology stocks; hence, they illustrate the return one would
have earned during the period if one held an equally-weighted portfolio of either the two
portfolios of firms’ stocks.

Figure 9 shows that, even before adjusting for the risk one bears in holding
pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies, both samples of companies significantly
underperformed the general market during the period when the HSA was being
developed and debated. Pharmaceutical firms’ stocks lost about 32 percent and
biotechnology firms’ stock lost much more, about twice 51 percent.

After adjusting for risk, pharmaceutical stocks suffered 70 percent losses and
biotechnology stocks suffered 90 percent losses. Over the sample period 1982-2006,
about 30 percent of the biotechnology firms were delisted because of mergers or
takeovers, and about 18 percent were delisted because their financial condition had
deteriorated to the point that they did not satisfy exchange minimum financial
requirements. By comparison, about 32 percent of the pharmaceutical firms were delisted
because of mergers or takeovers, and about 14 percent were delisted because their
financial condition had deteriorated to the point that they did not satisfy exchange
minimum financial requirements. This shows that biotechnology firms were probably
more financially vulnerable than pharmaceutical firms because they were somewhat more

18

likely to exhibit financial conditions that deteriorated to the extent that they were not
attractive takeover candidates. A theoretical model and argument for expecting these
results is presented in the appendix and relies on real options theory.

Financial Risk, Stock Price Changes, and R&D Spending: A Brief Overview

Given (i) biotech firms’ reliance on external capital markets to fund their R&D,
and the fact that they face a higher cost of equity capital than pharmaceutical firms, as the
empirical results in Table 1 show, and (ii) the greater sensitivity of biotechnology firm
stock prices to the HSA, a brief discussion of the implications these characteristics and
observations have for R&D spending is warranted.
Per point (i), the implication is clear: biotechnology firms, on average, face a
higher hurdle rate, or required rate of return, on their R&D projects. All things held
constant, biotechnology firms will spend less on R&D than traditional pharmaceutical
firms because fewer projects will meet investors (the firm owners) required rate of return.
This is illustrated below in Figure 11.

Figure 11: An Economic Model of Equilibrium R&D Spending

19

20

Figure 11 contains a single demand curve for R&D investment. It is appropriate to
think of this downward-sloping curve as reflecting the expected rates of return on all
potential R&D projects ordered from the highest expected return to the lowest. Firms will
continue to undertake R&D projects (and move down the demand curve) as long as the
expected rate of return on the next project exceeds the firms cost of capital. This supply
and demand model contains two equilibrium R&D expenditure levels: one for a
biotechnology firm with no cash flows (e.g., a firm with no sales) and one for a
pharmaceutical firm with positive cash flows, as well as access to external debt and
equity, like the biotech firm. If these two firms face identical investment opportunities, as
reflected by the single demand curve (i.e., the marginal efficiency of R&D), then the
equilibrium level of R&D spending for the biotech firm, R**, will be less than the
equilibrium level of R&D spending for the pharmaceutical firm, R*, because of greater
financial risk, limited access to internal funds, and higher cost of R&D capital.
Furthermore, within this simple but useful model it is easy to see how a policy that
reduces expected returns to R&D (causing a leftward shift in the demand curve) will
result in lower equilibrium R&D spending for both pharmaceutical and biotechnology
firms.
Per point (ii), the link between stock prices, expected returns, and R&D needs
first to be discussed first. Consider a biotechnology firm that has no marketed products
and several ongoing early-stage R&D projects. Because firm stock prices reflect investors
expectations of this firm’ future financial prospects, as is the case with all publicly traded
companies, a proposed policy or a new regulation that diminishes these prospects (i.e. the

21

HSA), will simultaneously reduce this firm’s stock prices and lower its demand for R&D,
all else considered4. The effect of a decline in the demand for R&D, ceteris paribus, is a
lower equilibrium R&D level, as described within the context of point (i). More
important, perhaps, is the sensitivity of R&D to stock price changes resulting from new
policy proposals or regulations. This story is somewhat more complex, and the appendix
provides technical details. Basically, when R&D projects are modeled as real options, it
is straight-forward to show that biotech firms have characteristics that predispose them to
having a higher degree of stock price sensitivity to policy shocks than pharmaceutical
firms. And this in turn will make their R&D spending more sensitive to policy shocks.
Golec, Hegde, and Vernon (2006) show this empirically in their study of the HSA effects
on the pharmaceutical industry.

Conclusions

The data and empirical results presented in this paper document numerous
important and significant differences in firm characteristics, financial risk, and
sensitivities to regulatory policy shocks between firms in the biotech industry and firms
in the pharmaceutical industry, as defined by NAICS SIC Codes. While there are indeed
challenges to defining the appropriate participants in these two industries for comparative
analyses, the thrust of this research is nevertheless clear: while pharmaceutical firms face
considerable financial risk and are vulnerable to policy shocks, biotechnology firms face
4

Deviating from this hypothetical biotechnology firm example raises important issues because firms with
marketed products will experience stock price declines due to the policy’s impact on current and future
products; moreover, firms may have business operations outside of the biotechnology industry (say
consumer products). The point we wish to convey is that establishing the link between stock prices and the
demand for R&D is more complicated that that suggested by our example.

more financial risk and are more vulnerable, on average, to policy shocks affecting
expected future profitability5. Given the biotechnology industry’s rapidly expanding role
and contribution to the discovery and development of new drugs and biologics, it is
important for policy makers to be cognizant of the fact that this industry, as a result of its
dependence on external capital and the heightened sensitivity it has to policy shocks and
new regulations, is more fragile with respect to its R&D projects and programs than the
more established pharmaceutical industry. This is particular true for smallest
biotechnology companies.

We also ran analyses using the Biotechnology Industry Organization’s (BIO) membership to define
biotechs, both with and without its largest members that fall under the NACIS coding for pharmaceutical
firms. When these large companies were excluded the BIO sample and the biotechnology NACIS sample
produced nearly identical results.

Appendix: Financial Risk and R&D Projects as Real Options

A more formal way to relate financial risk, leverage, and the cost of capital to
R&D expenditures comes from modern finance theory and uses a real options
framework. We briefly present this next and discuss some recent empirical evidence on
these links within the context of the aforementioned Clinton administration HSA.
We begin by characterizing firms based on how intensively they invest in R&D,
and the leverage of the R&D. As shown and discussed in the paper, this is a key
differentiating feature of the two samples. Biotechnology firms are, as shown in Figure 6,
more R&D intensive, on average, than pharmaceutical firms, and the greater a firm’s
R&D intensity and leverage, the greater the impact of the HSA on firm value and stock
price. This is what we observed and summarized in Figures 9 and 10 with respect to
biotechnologies more negative stock price reactions to HSA events and shocks.
To see this more formally consider the following simple model (see Golec,
Hegde, and Vernon, 2006 for a more nuanced discussion and presentation). Let firm
value be V, and the net present value of future firm cash flows under (no) price controls
be (VN) VH. If the probability of price controls is p, then the value of the firm is:
V = p VH + (1 – p)VN .

(2)

Expected future cash flows from new drug sales under price controls will be
smaller than under no price controls. News that causes p to increase will reduce the value
of the firm and the greater the difference between VH and VN, the greater the reduction in
value. This is, of course, all very intuitive. Assume for simplicity that the firm’s R&D

25

portfolio is a single project, which can be described as a call option. If the firm chooses
to, it can spend E dollars on R&D and receive a call option on the production of a new
drug. The value of the R&D project under price controls, VH, is thus the following:
VH = c(SH, σH, X, T, r) – E

(3)

The value of the project under no price controls, VN, is
VN = c(SN, σN, X, T, r) – E

(4)

The function c( • ) defines the value of a call option on a new drug with an
expected net present value of future cash flows of Sj, j = H, N, a percent volatility for Sj
of σj, and a fixed investment cost to build a production plant of X at time T in the future.
The risk-free rate of return is r. Drug price constraints, as outlined in the Clinton HSA,
will reduce a drug’s future cash flows, but not the expected production costs, X (X is
equivalent to financial leverage). This will reduce the option’s in-the-moneyness (S – X),
and hence its value. Galai and Masulis (1976) have show why (S – X) is negatively
related to asset beta (β). Therefore, a firm composed of mostly at-the-money or out-ofthe-money R&D projects should have a relatively large β and be relatively sensitive to
price controls (or other regulatory events and or shocks that have a similar effect). That
is, the value of out-of-the-money projects will fall proportionately more, and are more
likely to be abandoned because their values are more likely to fall below E.
Option value is also positively related to σj. Therefore, we expect the stock price
response of firms with large pre-event σj to be less sensitive to the HSA news, and
positively related to the event-induced change in volatility, all else equal. Although the

26

moneyness, βj, and σj of a firm’s R&D options are not observable, the R&D sensitivity
can be partly inferred from a firm’s pre-event stock βi and σi, as well as their changes
during the HSA event period. All else equal, price regulation is likely to increase a firm’s
βi and decrease its σi. Of course, the size of the changes will vary across firms depending

upon the sensitivity of the firms’ R&D assets to price controls. Thus, external policy
shocks such as proposed price regulations will reduce the option value of firms’ R&D
projects by simultaneously reducing expected future cash flows and future cash flow
volatilities. Golec, Hegde, and Vernon (2006) study these links carefully and estimate the
impact of the HSA events on subsequent R&D spending, which declined relative to
expected/predicted levels.
