JEL No. G12
ABSTRACT
This paper empirically analyzes the Expectations Hypothesis (EH) in inflation-indexed (or real) bonds
and in nominal bonds in the US and in the UK. We strongly reject the EH in inflation-indexed bonds,
and also confirm and update the existing evidence rejecting the EH in nominal bonds. This rejection
implies that the risk premium on both real and nominal bonds varies predictably over time. We also
find strong evidence that the spread between the nominal and the real bond risk premium, or the break-even
inflation risk premium, also varies over time. We argue that the time variation in real bond risk premia
mostly likely reflects both a changing real interest rate risk premium and a changing liquidity risk
premium, and that the variability in the nominal bond risk premia reflects a changing inflation risk
premium. We estimate significant time series variability in the magnitude and sign of bond risk premia.

Introduction

This article conducts an empirical exploration of the magnitude and time variation
of risk premia in inflation-indexed and nominal government bonds, using data on US
Treasury bonds and UK gilts. Understanding bond risk premia is fundamental in
thinking about the term structure of interest rates. It is also of first order importance
for bond issuers, since public debt constitutes one of the main sources of government financing, and for users, whether central banks or investors. Central banks use
government bonds as a key instrument in the execution of monetary policy, while
investors use them as the anchor of their fixed income allocations.
The most common form of government bonds are nominal bonds that pay fixed
coupons and principal. However, in recent times governments around the world,
including the U.S. Treasury, have started issuing significant amounts of inflationindexed bonds (Campbell, Shiller, and Viceira 2009). Inflation-indexed bonds, which
in the U.S. are known as Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS), are bonds
whose coupons and principal adjust automatically with the evolution of a consumer
price index2 . They aim to pay investors a fixed inflation-adjusted coupon and principal. For this reason they are also known as real bonds, and their yields are typically
considered the best proxy for the term structure of real interest rates in the economy.
Although government bonds in large stable economics are generally free from
default risk, they expose investors to other risks. Investors holding either inflationindexed or nominal government bonds are exposed to the risk of changing real interest
rates. For any investor the riskless asset is an inflation-indexed bond whose cash
flows match his consumption plan (Campbell and Viceira 2001, Wachter 2003). If
future real interest rates are uncertain, investors will view bonds not matching the
timing and length of their consumption plans as risky, leading to a risk premium
for holding such bonds. This real interest rate risk premium will be a function of
investors’ risk tolerance, and it can be time-varying if investors’ tolerance for risk
changes over the business cycle (Campbell and Cochrane 1999, Wachter 2006). A
time-varying correlation of real interest rates with investor well-being can also make
the real interest rate risk premium vary over time (Campbell, Sunderam, and Viceira
2010).

In the US, TIPS payments are linked to the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers
(CPI-U). The relevant index in the UK is the Retail Price Index (RPI).

In addition to real interest rate risk, nominal government bonds expose investors
to inflation risk. When future inflation is uncertain, the coupons and principal of
nominal bonds can suﬀer from the eroding eﬀects of inflationary surprises. If inflation is negatively correlated with economic conditions, as in times of stagflation, the
real payoﬀs of nominal bonds will tend to decline when economic conditions worsen.
Risk averse investors will therefore demand a positive inflation risk premium for holding nominal bonds. But if inflation is positively correlated with economic conditions,
nominal bonds will have hedging value to risk-averse investors (Piazzesi and Schneider
2007, Campbell, Sunderam, and Viceira 2010). By contrast, inflation-indexed bonds
are not exposed to inflation risk, since their coupons and principal adjust automatically with inflation.3
The starting point of our empirical investigation of bond risk premia is the expectations hypothesis of interest rates (EH for short). The EH postulates that the risk
premium on long-term bonds, or the expected excess return on long-term bonds over
short-term bonds, should be constant over time. If the EH holds for inflation-indexed
bonds, this implies that the real interest rate risk premium is constant. In that case
the yield on long-term inflation-indexed bonds is equal to the average expected shortterm real interest rate over the life of the bond plus a constant. Investors cannot earn
predictable returns by shifting between long-maturity and short-maturity real bonds.
The implications of the EH for nominal bonds are stronger. If it holds, both
the inflation risk premium and the real interest rate risk premium are constant4 . In
that case the yield on long-term nominal bonds is equal to the average expected future short-term nominal interest rate up to a constant. A rejection of the nominal
expectations hypothesis can be the result of a time-varying inflation risk premium,
a time-varying real interest rate risk premium, or both. Without independent observation of real bond prices it is hard to distinguish between those sources of time
variation in nominal bond risk premia.
In our analysis we adopt a flexible empirical approach that does not rely on a
tightly parameterized model5 . The EH has been tested and rejected on U.S. nominal

Tax regulations in some countries, including the US, make the after-tax income and capital gains
from inflation-indexed bonds not fully inflation indexed. This eﬀect can be exacerbated at times of
high accelerating inflation. See Section 2.

real interest rate risk premium exactly cancel each other out.

Treasury bonds numerous times, but previous tests for inflation-indexed bonds only
had significantly shorter samples at their disposal and were not able to reject the
expectations hypothesis (Barr and Campbell 1997). Campbell and Shiller (1991)
present regression results for diﬀerent combinations of maturities and holding periods
and resoundingly reject the expectations hypothesis for U.S. nominal bonds. Fama
and Bliss (1987), Cochrane and Piazzesi (2005) and others have also presented robust
empirical evidence that nominal Treasury bond risk premia vary over time. However,
Campbell (1999) presents evidence that the expectations hypothesis is harder to reject
on nominal government bonds in a cross-section of other developed economies.
The structure of this article is as follows. Section 2 describes the mechanics of
inflation-indexed bonds. Section 3 formalizes the expectations hypothesis of the term
structure of interest rates and expected inflation. Section 4 tests the expectations
hypothesis in real and nominal bonds. Section 5 provides evidence on real and nominal
bond return predictability from the tent-shaped linear combination of nominal interest
rates proposed by Cochrane and Piazzesi (2005). Section 6 shows estimates of bond
risk premia and their variation over time. Finally, section 7 oﬀers some concluding
remarks and suggestions for future research.

Inflation-Indexed Bonds

Inflation-indexed bonds have been available in the UK since 1983 and in the US since
1997. US inflation-indexed bonds are called Treasury Inflation Protected Securities
(TIPS). They are designed to approximate real bonds with payouts that are constant
despite inflation surprises. They are quoted in terms of a real interest rate and are
issued mostly at long maturities greater than 10 years. The principal on these bonds
grows with a pre-specified price index, which in the U.S. is the Consumer Price Index
(CPI-U) and in the UK is the Retail Price Index (RPI). The coupons are equal to the
inflation-adjusted principal on the bond times a fixed coupon rate. Thus the coupons
on these bonds also fluctuate with inflation.
Of course, the price index might not grow over time. For instance the CPI decreased by almost 4% between September 2008 and December 2008. In the US, the
final payment of principal on a TIPS is protected against deflation and it can never

data on both real and nominal bonds.

be smaller than the stated nominal value at issuance. However, its coupons are not:
the inflation-adjusted value of the principal for coupon computation purposes can fall
below the initial value at issuance. In contrast, neither the principal nor the coupons
on inflation-linked gilts in the UK are protected from deflation.
Further details complicate the pricing of these bonds. Since inflation figures in the
US and in the UK are published with a lag, the principal value of inflation-indexed
bonds adjusts with a 3 month lag. UK inflation-linked gilts that were issued prior to
the financial year 2005-06 follow an 8 month lagged indexing procedure while more
recent issues follow a 3 month lagged methodology. The tax treatment of these bonds
also diﬀers. In the UK principal adjustments of inflation-linked gilts are not taxed.
This gives inflation-linked gilts a tax advantage over nominal gilts, a larger share
of whose cash flows come in the form of taxable nominal coupon payments. In the
US, on the other hand, inflation-adjustments of principal are considered ordinary
income for tax purposes. As a result the tax obligations associated with holding a
TIPS increase when inflation is high so that on an after-tax basis U.S. TIPS are not
fully indexed to inflation. More details on TIPS can be found in Viceira (2001), Roll
(2004) and Gurkaynak, Sack, and Wright (2010). Campbell and Shiller (1996) oﬀer a
discussion of the taxation of inflation-indexed bonds. Campbell, Shiller, and Viceira
(2009) provide an overview of the history of inflation-indexed bonds in the US and
the UK.

The Expectations Hypothesis

The expectations hypothesis of the term structure of interest rates says that the excess return on an -period bond over a 1-period bond should be constant over time.
There should not be any particularly good time to hold short-term or long-term bonds.
Equivalently, the expectations hypothesis says that if short yields are anticipated to
rise in the future then this should already be reflected in current long yields. The
expectations hypothesis is usually stated for nominal bonds. We formulate expectations hypotheses for nominal bonds, real bonds and for inflation expectations. We
show that these diﬀerent interpretations of the expectations hypothesis are closely related to real interest rate risk, inflation risk and liquidity premia and derive empirical
predictions that we will test subsequently.

Bond Notation and Definitions

We start by establishing some notation and definitions that will be used throughout
the article. We denote by $ the log price of a zero-coupon -period nominal bond,
$
and by 
the bond’s log (or continuously compounded) yield. For zero-coupon
bonds, log price and yield are related according to

The log return on a zero-coupon -period bond if it is held for one period and

where the second equality follows immediately from (1).
We use the superscript    to denote the corresponding quantities for both US
and UK inflation-indexed bonds. Inflation-indexed bonds are commonly quoted in
  
terms of real yields. That is   is the real log price of an indexed bond, 
is
  
the real yield and + is the real one-period log return. The nominal one-period log
  
return on an inflation-indexed bond is then given by +1
+  1  where  1 denotes
the 1-period log inflation rate from period  to period  + 1.

3.2

Nominal Expectations Hypothesis

The nominal EH states that the expected log excess return on long-term nominal
bonds over short-term nominal bonds, or bond risk premium, is constant over time:
£ $
¤
$
$
(3)
E +1 − 1 =  

where the constant bond risk premium $ can depend on maturity . The advantage of formulating the expectations hypothesis in logs is that the log expectations
5

hypothesis for one holding period is consistent with the log expectations hypothesis
for any other holding period.6
The EH can be represented in a number of diﬀerent ways that obtain by simple
algebraic manipulation of (2) and (3).7 A popular equivalent representation of the
nominal EH relates the yield on a n-period zero-coupon nominal bond at time  to
expected future short-term nominal interest rates:

(4)

Equation (4) says that the current n-period yield should be equal to the expected
average short yields over its maturity up to a time-invariant constant $ . The constant
$ is simply the average of bond risk premia for maturities up to  periods, i.e., $ =

=2  . A second equivalent representation of the nominal EH relates changes in
long-term yields to the yield spread

Although these alternative equivalent representations of the EH provide useful intuition to understand the meaning and implications of the EH, we choose to work
with the return-based definition (3) in our empirical exploration of the EH. This
approach allows for transparent interpretation of empirical results in terms of return predictability, and it is flexible enough to easily accommodate a complementary
analysis of liquidity premia and supply pressures in the bond market.

based on (5) found robust evidence that the nominal term spread–or an equivalent
combination of forward rates–predicts nominal excess returns positively (Campbell
and Shiller 1991, Fama and Bliss 1987). That is, whenever the term spread is high
6

Another version of the expectations hypothesis, the so-called pure expectations hypothesis
(PEH), considers a formulation of (3) in terms of simple returns as opposed to log returns, and
sets expected excess simple returns to zero (Campbell, Lo, and MacKinlay 1997). The intuition of
the PEH is that if investors are risk neutral then they should adjust positions until the expected
one-period returns for short nominal bonds and long nominal bonds are equalized. The log EH (3)
is less constraining in that it allows for a non-zero bond risk premium.

For a detailed discussion of equivalent formulations of the expectations hypothesis see Campbell,
Lo, and MacKinlay (1997, Chapter 10) or Cochrane (2005, Chapter 19).

the risk premium on long nominal bonds is higher.8 Building on this prior work, we
test in our data whether the term spread contains a time-varying risk premium by
running the regression test

(6)

where  $ = 0 under the null that the EH holds. Of course, failing to reject  $ = 0
in (6) does not imply that we fail to reject the EH, as other state variables might
forecast bond excess returns. Thus we also include in (6) other variables that have
been shown to forecast bond excess returns in our empirical analysis.

3.3

Real Expectations Hypothesis

The EH has traditionally been formulated and tested in terms of nominal bonds but
it appears at least as plausible to formulate the hypothesis in terms of real bonds.
The nominal EH supposes that the bond risk premium on nominal bonds, consisting
of both inflation risk and real interest rate risk, is constant over time. The EH for
inflation-indexed bonds is strictly weaker in that it only supposes that real interest
rate risk is constant.
Expressed in terms of returns the EH for inflation-indexed zero-coupon bonds says
that

  

Analogously to the nominal EH we test the real EH by testing whether the real
term spread predicts excess returns on real bonds:

where   = 

is the TIPS bond spread. The real EH hypothesis implies
that the coeﬃcient of real excess log returns of inflation-indexed bonds on the real
term spread should be zero. If     6= 0 then we can infer that the real yield reflects
time-varying real risk premia and    is time-varying. The TIPS bond spread is a
natural candidate regressor due to its similarity to the nominal bond spread. Since
TIPS are not exposed to inflation surprises the TIPS yield spread should not reflect

This is equivalent to finding a negative slope in a regression of changes in the yield on long-term
bonds on $ ( − 1).

inflation risk, although it might reflect other risk premia such as real interest rate
risk and liquidity premia. Hence, if any of these premia are important in driving the
rejection of the nominal expectations hypothesis they would be likely to be reflected
in terms of a nonzero coeﬃcient     

3.4

Breakeven Inflation and the Inflation Expectation Hypothesis

We now look at the diﬀerence between nominal and indexed yields, known by bond
market participants as “breakeven inflation:”
$
  
 = 
− 

(9)

Most simply -period breakeven inflation is the inflation rate over the next  periods
that would make a nominal bond and an indexed bond of maturity  earn the exact
same buy-and-hold return. The nominal bond outperforms the inflation-indexed bond
if realized inflation over the life of the bonds turns out to be smaller than breakeven
inflation, and underperforms it if realized inflation turns out to be larger.
Bond market participants often use breakeven inflation as a measure of expected
inflation. However, the identification of breakeven inflation with expected inflation
is not entirely correct. In order to understand this point, it is useful to think about
the components of bond yields, both nominal and inflation-indexed. Economic logic,
formally corroborated by models of the term structure of interest rates,9 suggests that
we can decompose the yield—or equivalently, the price–on an inflation-indexed bond
into a component that reflects current expectations of future real interest rates, and a
component that reflects a real interest rate risk premium. Similarly, we can think of
the yield on a nominal bond as composed of the yield on a real bond plus additional
components reflecting expectations of future inflation and an inflation risk premium.
Thus the spread between both yields, or breakeven inflation, reflects both expected
inflation and the inflation risk premium embedded in the nominal bond yield.
If institutional, behavioral, or liquidity factors aﬀect the nominal bond market and
the inflation-indexed bond market diﬀerently, breakeven inflation will also reflect the
diﬀerential impact of these factors on yields (Pflueger and Viceira 2010). For example,
we think of the market for inflation-indexed bonds to be less liquid than the market for
9

nominal bonds. If investors apply a liquidity discount to the price of inflation-indexed
bonds, or a liquidity premium to the price of nominal bonds, breakeven inflation will
be lower than it would be otherwise, since prices and yields move inversely.10 When
changes in the liquidity diﬀerential are correlated with aggregate economic conditions,
breakeven inflation will also reflect an additional liquidity risk premium.
Of course, expected inflation, the inflation risk premium, the liquidity diﬀerential, and the liquidity risk premium need not be constant over time, causing realized
breakeven inflation to move over time. More importantly, time variation in the inflation risk premium or in the liquidity premium can also cause the expected excess
return on breakeven inflation, or the diﬀerence between the excess return on nominal
bonds and the excess return on inflation-indexed bonds of identical maturity, to vary
over time. Mechanically, the excess return on breakeven inflation is given by

− 1
− +1 − 1
=  − ( − 1) −1+1 − 1 
(10)

Under the assumption of constant inflation and liquidity risk premia, the left-hand
side of equation (10) equals a constant plus the expression   − ( − 1)  −1+1 −
 1 , where   denotes n-period expected inflation at time . This expression is zero
when inflation expectations are rational. To see this, note that realized inflation
verifies
  − ( − 1)  −1+1 −  1 = 0
(11)
since both  +1 and ( − 1)  −1+1 +  1 denote cumulative inflation from time
 to time  + . Therefore under rational expectations equation (11) must also hold
ex-ante.

We call the joint hypothesis of rational inflation expectations and a constant
inflation risk premium the inflation expectations hypothesis. By analogy with our
tests of the nominal and real EH, we run the regression

=  +    + +1 
+1
10

(12)

Campbell, Shiller, and Viceira (2009) document an episode of “flight to liquidity” during the
recent financial crisis. In the Fall of 2008 the price of nominal Treasury bonds increased rapidly,
while the price of TIPS declined, causing a dramatic narrowing of breakeven inflation, which at
some point became even negative. They provide evidence that this change in prices did not reflect
a sudden change in the outlook for inflation towards massive deflation, but rather an increase in
the liquidity diﬀerential between both markets, as investors around the world flew into nominal
Treasuries.

9

where  =  − 1 is the breakeven inflation spread, and test whether   = 0. If
the inflation risk premium or the liquidity risk premium are time varying, and they
are correlated with the breakeven inflation spread, we would expect to find a nonzero
regression slope coeﬃcient   in (12). In particular, the breakeven spread  should
reflect the inflation risk premium contained in the nominal yield spread $ .
Since the breakeven inflation spread, the nominal term spread, and the real term
spread are mechanically related by $ =  +   , it also makes sense to test
whether both the real term spread and the breakeven inflation spread jointly forecast
the return on breakeven inflation. It is important to note that neither (12) nor the
expanded version of the equation that includes   are redundant with respect to
the standard EH regressions (8) and (6), except of course in the trivial case where the
spreads do not forecast bond excess returns and thus all slope coeﬃcients are zero.

4.1

Testing the Expectations Hypothesis in Real and
Nominal Government Bonds
Data

We conduct tests of the real and nominal EH using government bond data from both
the US and UK. For the US we use an expanded version of the Gurkaynak, Sack, and
Wright (2007) and Gurkaynak, Sack, and Wright (2010, GSW henceforth) data set.
GSW have constructed a zero-coupon yield curve starting in January 1961 for nominal
bonds and starting in January 1999 for TIPS by fitting a smoothed yield curve. We
expand their data back to 1951 using the McCulloch, Houston, and Kwon (1993)
data for US nominal zero coupon yields from January 1951 through December 1960.
The GSW data set contains constant maturity yields for maturities of 2 to 20 years.
Our empirical tests will focus on the 10-year nominal and real yields, because this
maturity bracket has the longest and most continuous history of TIPS outstanding.
We measure U.S. inflation with the all-urban seasonally adjusted CPI, and the shortterm nominal interest rate with the 3 month T-bill rate from the Fama-Bliss riskless
interest rate file from CRSP. TIPS payouts are linked to the all-urban non seasonally
adjusted CPI and our results become slightly stronger when using the non seasonally
adjusted CPI instead.

10

For the UK we use zero-coupon yield curves from the Bank of England. Anderson
and Sleath (2001) describe the spline-based techniques used to estimate the yield
curves. Nominal yields are available starting in 1970 for 0.5 to 20 years to maturity.
Real yields are available starting in 1985 for 2.5 to 25 years to maturity. We focus on
the 20-year nominal and real yields because they are available from 1985, while other
maturities are available only since 1991.We measure inflation by the non seasonallyadjusted Retail Price Index, which serves as the measure of inflation for inflation
indexed bond payouts.

In all regressions we approximate −1+1
and −1+1
with +1
and +1
.
Because neither the US nor the UK governments issue inflation-indexed bills, we need
to resort to an empirical procedure to build a hypothetical short-term real interest
rate. We describe this procedure in Section 4.2. Finally, although our yield data sets
are available at a monthly frequency, we sample our data at a quarterly frequency
in order to reduce the influence of high-frequency noise in observed inflation and
short-term nominal interest rate volatility in our tests.

4.2

Construction of the Short-Term Real Interest Rate

While three-month nominal T-bills are issued in the US and in the UK, there exists
no equivalent short-term instrument with fixed real payoﬀs. Apart from technical
diﬃculties, the demand would probably not exist simply because inflation risk in
both countries has been historically negligible over such a short horizon. However, we
need a proxy for a short-term real rate for our tests of the expectations hypothesis.
We follow Campbell and Shiller’s (1996) analysis of hypothetical TIPS to construct
an ex-ante measure of the short-term real interest rate.
We start by assuming zero inflation risk and liquidity premium over 1 quarter.
Therefore, the ex-ante short-term real interest rate is given by
  
$
= 1
−  1 
1

Next we assume that inflation expectations over the next quarter are rational and
proxy for the ex-ante real short rate as the fitted value from the regression of this
$
$
quarter’s realized real rate 1
− 1+1 onto last quarter’s realized real rate 1−1
− 1 ,
$
the nominal short rate 1 , and annual inflation up to time 
Table 1 shows the monthly predictive regressions for the US and the UK. It reports
11

the point estimates of the slope coeﬃcients as well as Newey-West heteroskedasticity
and autocorrelation consistent (h.a.c.) standard errors with four lags in parenthesis.
The table shows that the main determinant of the ex-ante real rate is the nominal rate,
with a positive coeﬃcient of about 0.5 in both the US and the UK. The regressions can
explain 44% of the real interest rate variation in the US and 18% of the real interest
rate variation in the UK, respectively, and the regressors are jointly significant in
both regressions.
Figure 1 shows the predicted and realized US real short rate together with the
nominal short rate. It shows that the predicted real short rate very much just follows
the nominal short rate and smooths out fluctuations in the ex-post real rate caused
by short-term volatility in realized inflation. The estimate is conservative in the sense
that it barely relies on lagged realized inflation and it does not attempt to predict
high-frequency fluctuations in inflation.
Table 2 presents summary statistics for inflation, short-term nominal and real interest rates, nominal and real yield spreads, breakeven inflation, and bond returns for
the US (Panel A) and the UK (Panel B). Because the sample period and bond maturity in each table are diﬀerent, it is hard to do comparisons across panels. Nonetheless,
the average excess return on nominal bonds is similar across both countries, while the
average excess return on inflation-indexed bonds have been larger in the US. Bond
return volatilities and correlations are generally comparable across both countries,
controlling for maturity diﬀerentials. The average excess returns and volatilities reported in Table 2 imply sample Sharpe ratios on US real and nominal bonds of 0.392
and 0.542, respectively. These are larger than the corresponding Sharpe ratios for
UK real and nominal bonds, at 0.236 and 0.179 respectively.

4.3

The Nominal Expectations Hypothesis in the US

Tables 3 report tests of the nominal EH in the US using our preferred return-based
regression test (6). Thus we test whether nominal log excess returns are predictable
from the nominal term spread. The objective of this table is to analyze changes in
the predictability of nominal bond returns since Campbell and Shiller (1991) reported
tests of the nominal EH. Campbell and Shiller (1991) found that they were able to
clearly reject the expectations hypothesis for almost all of their maturity combinations for the sample period 1952-1987. Table 3 reruns those same regressions for our
full sample period (1951.12-2009.12) with the 10-year constant maturity zero-coupon
12

bond. For comparison we also report them for the Campbell-Shiller sample period and
the sample period from 1987 until present.11 The table reports the point estimates
of the slope coeﬃcients and Newey-West standard errors with 3 lags.
Table 3 shows that the full time period 1952-2009 yields an even stronger rejection
of the expectations hypothesis than the earlier sample period 1952-1987. At the same
time, using the second part of the sample only it is harder to reject the expectations
hypothesis at conventional significance levels. Stock and Watson (2002) document a
break in the mid-1980s in a number of macroeconomic time series. If the predictability
of bond returns is linked to macroeconomic processes, it is conceivable that bond
return predictability also experienced a break at the same time.
Following this intuition, the last column of Table 3 examines more closely whether
there was a structural change in bond return predictability in 1987. We add the term
spread interacted with a dummy for the second sub period, $ × 1987−2008 to the
regression in order to allow for diﬀerent slope coeﬃcients before 1987 and after 1987.
The interaction term does not enter significantly the regression, indicating that we
cannot reject the hypothesis of a stable relationship across sub samples. Moreover,
the full sample period and the Campbell-Shiller sample period yield very similar
regression coeﬃcients and the coeﬃcient is more accurately measured using the full
sample period.
Thus the addition of the 1987-2009 period to the early sample period contributes
to reinforce the empirical evidence towards rejection of the nominal EH. It also emphasizes the diﬃculty of detecting this type of bond return predictability in smaller
sample sizes, even if the sample comprises more than 20 years of data. This qualification is particularly important for our subsequent analysis of the real EH, because
even our longest series of inflation-indexed bonds only spans a 24 year period from
1985 to 2009.

4.4

Expectations Hypothesis Real and Nominal

Table 4 present our main regression tests for the nominal, real and inflation expectations hypothesis in the US and in the UK. Columns 1 through 4 in each panel in
11

Campbell and Shiller (1991) used the McCulloch, Huston, and Kwon (1993) data of zero coupon
yields for their entire period so that our results diﬀer slightly from theirs due to our diﬀerent data
source.

13

the table report coeﬃcients from the return-based regressions (6), (8), (12) and its
expanded version, respectively. The data consists of monthly data of overlapping
quarterly returns. Newey-West standard errors are based on 3 lags to adjust for
overlapping returns.
Panel A reports the regression tests for the US data from 1999 to 2009. According
to the nominal EH the coeﬃcient in column 1 should be zero. We cannot reject
the nominal EH over this particular time period at conventional significance levels.
However, this rejection is somewhat marginal–the significance level is 15%–and the
results in Table 3 indicate that this may well be related to the short sample size rather
than a change in the predictive relationship. Column 2 of the panel tests whether
excess returns on inflation-indexed bonds are predictable. The coeﬃcient on the real
spread is large compared to the coeﬃcient on the nominal spread reported in column
1, and statistically significant at the 1% level. This strong rejection of the real EH is
particularly striking in light of the weak rejection of the nominal EH in column 1. It
suggests that factors specific to the TIPS market such as liquidity might be driving
expected excess return on TIPS, besides real interest rate risk.12
Column 3 of Panel A tests the inflation EH in the US. We find that the breakeven
spread predicts the diﬀerence in nominal and inflation-indexed bond excess returns.
Assuming that bond market participants’ inflation expectations are rational and that
liquidity premia are constant, this result is consistent with a time-varying inflation
risk premium. Column 4 also controls for the real term spread in the regression and
shows that adding this variable does not aﬀect the predictive power or the coeﬃcient
estimate of the breakeven spread. These results suggest that when the breakeven
spread increases, inflation risk also increases and investors demand a higher inflation
risk premium from nominal bonds.
Interestingly, the real term spread appears to predict breakeven returns negatively in the US. Thus a widening of the real term spread forecasts a decrease in the
spread between nominal bond risk premia and inflation-indexed bond risk premia.
One might expect that if the real term spread proxies for the real interest rate risk
premium, its coeﬃcient should be zero; that is, increases in the real interest rate
risk premium should aﬀect approximately in the same proportion the prices of both
inflation-indexed bonds and nominal bonds. The rejection of the null hypothesis that
12

Results ommitted here to save space show that, interestingly, the nominal term spread does
not forecast TIPS excess returns, while the real term spread does not forecast nominal bond excess
returns.

14

it is zero suggests that the eﬀect of the real term spread on breakeven inflation returns
might be related to liquidity factors (Pflueger and Viceira 2010).
Panel B in Table 4 reports the corresponding results for the UK bond market.
The pattern of results is remarkably consistent with the results shown in Panel A for
the US bond market, with the exception that the real term spread does not appear
to predict breakeven returns.
Overall, the results in Table 4 provide strong support for the predictability of
nominal and real bond returns and for the predictability of their diﬀerence in US
and UK bond data. These results provide support for the hypothesis that the risk
premium on nominal bonds is driven by both a time-varying inflation risk premium
and a time-varying real interest rate risk premium. An increase in breakeven inflation
forecasts positively an increase in nominal bond risk premia relative to inflationindexed bond risk premia. The US results also show the striking result that the real
term spread forecasts negatively the spread between the nominal bond risk premium
and the inflation-indexed bond risk premium. Pflueger and Viceira (2010) present
empirical evidence that this is the result of a time-varying liquidity risk premium in
inflation-indexed bonds.

Cochrane and Piazzesi Bond Return Predictability and the Inflation Risk Premium

In recent work Cochrane and Piazzesi (2005, CP) show that a tent-shaped linear
combination of nominal forward rates is a good predictor of excess nominal bond
returns for a wide range of bond maturities. Their findings imply that nominal bond
risk premia are high when intermediate-term nominal interest rates are high relative
to both shorter-term and longer-term rates. In the context of a non-linear model of
the term structure of interest rates, Campbell, Sunderam, and Viceira (2010) interpret
their findings as reflecting a time-varying transitory inflation risk premium.
We explore this interpretation by examining whether the CP tent-shaped combination of nominal forward rates forecasts inflation-indexed bond excess returns in
addition to nominal bond excess returns. If the Cochrane Piazzesi factor reflects
inflation risk premia it should not predict returns on inflation-indexed bonds.

15

We construct the CP factor from one- to five-year Fama-Bliss zero coupon nominal
$
bond yields, available from CRSP. Let 
denote the log 1 year nominal forward
rate at time  for loans between  − 1 and  years in the future. We obtain the
CP factor using the optimal weights found in Cochrane, Piazzesi (2005) as  =

 Unfortunately we do not have enough
richness in the term structure of TIPS rates to construct a CP variable based on TIPS
yields. We also limit our analysis to the US.
Panel A in Table 5 reproduces the CP predictability results for our data set, using
the 1952-2009 sample period and a one-quarter forecasting horizon. Column 1 in the
panel shows that CP is significant and forecasts nominal bond excess returns with a
respectable 2 of 4% at a quarterly horizon. However, column 2 in the panel shows
that the variable loses its statistical significance once we control for the yield spread.
Panel B in Table 5 shows that CP does not forecast nominal bond excess returns,
TIPS excess returns, and breakeven inflation over our 1999-2009 sample period. Panel
B also shows that the inclusion of CP in the nominal and real EH regressions does
not change our basic results. The factor enters significantly and with a positive sign
only in the last column. Comparing this to column 4 of Table 4 shows that CP also
increases the 2 from 20% to 27% When CP is high, nominal bond excess returns
are expected to be larger than inflation-indexed bond excess returns. This result is
consistent with Campbell, Sunderam, and Viceira (2010)’s interpretation of CP as a
proxy for a time-varying inflation risk premium.

Historical Fitted Risk Premia

We now look at the fitted risk premia in order to better understand the economic
significance of the bond return predictability examined in this article. Table 6 shows
the mean and standard deviation of the fitted excess log returns from the EH regressions shown in Table 4.13 Panel A reports results for the US, while Panel B reports
results for the UK.
Panel A in Table 6 shows that TIPS have had a high average risk premium over our
sample period. This premium is also larger than the average risk premium on nominal
13

Since the regressions include a constant, the mean of the fitted values coincide with the mean
excess log return reported in Table 2.

16

bonds, which results in a negative average breakeven inflation risk premium. Pflueger
and Viceira (2010) show evidence that this negative premium is mostly driven by a
positive liquidity risk premium in TIPS, not by a negative inflation risk premium in
nominal Treasury bonds. In fact, Panel B shows that the average breakeven inflation
risk premium in the UK is positive, consistent with the notion that the inflation risk
premium is positive on average. Columns 2 and 3 in each panel show that bond
risk premia exhibit significant variability over time, although this variability is small
relative to the overall variability of realized bond excess returns.
Figure 2 illustrates the time series of the fitted bond risk premia and their diﬀerence–
the breakeven inflation risk premium–in the US (Panel A) and in the UK (Panel B).
Panel A in the figure shows that the nominal and TIPS risk premia have generally moved together, and that they exhibit significant variability over time. Bond
risk premia declined during the period following the stock market crash of the early
2000’s, increased during 2002 and 2003, and declined and became even negative in
the subsequent period until they increased again at the onset of the recent financial
crisis.
However, the breakeven inflation risk premium also shows significant time series
variation, implying that the magnitude of the changes in nominal and real bond risk
premia was not identical. There were times at which they even moved in opposite
directions. The breakeven inflation risk premium was markedly negative at the beginning of the sample, when TIPS were first issued and investors might not have
been familiar with them, and during the recent financial crisis, when the TIPS risk
premium increased dramatically.
Panel B in Figure 2 shows the time series of the fitted UK risk premia. The
nominal, real and breakeven risk premia have moved together over the period 1985 to
2009 and, consistent with the results shown in Table 6, the nominal bond risk premium
has been above the real bond risk premium for most of the sample. In contrast to the
US bond market, both the nominal bond risk premium and the real bond risk premium
shot up during the financial crisis. The nominal bond risk premium increased more
than the real bond risk premium, causing the breakeven inflation risk premium to
increase during the crisis. As in the case of the US bond market, the risk premium on
UK bonds, both real and nominal, is not necessarily positive at all times. There are
periods of negative bond risk premia, most notably the turn of the 1990’s for both
real and nominal bonds and the period 2004-2008 for real bonds.

Conclusion

This article explores the EH of the term structure of interest rates in the US and in
the UK government real and nominal bond markets. It documents predictability of
excess returns in inflation-indexed bonds and in nominal bonds in both markets, thus
rejecting the EH, both real and nominal. While return predictability in US Treasury
nominal bonds has been well-documented in the past, to our knowledge this is the
first article to provide direct empirical evidence for predictability of returns in real
bonds. We also find robust evidence that breakeven inflation returns, or the spread
between nominal bond excess returns and inflation-indexed bond excess returns, are
predictable.
The rejection of the real EH implies that investors in the inflation-indexed bond
market face a time-varying risk premium that reflects a time-varying real interest rate
risk premium and possibly also a time-varying liquidity premium. The rejection of the
nominal EH and particularly the rejection that expected breakeven inflation returns
are constant suggests that inflation risk, and the premium that investors demand for
bearing it, also varies over time. Real and nominal bond risk premia appear to be
positively related to the real and nominal term spread, respectively. When the real
term spread increases, expected returns on inflation-indexed bond returns increase
and, interestingly, real bonds are also expected to outperform nominal bonds. When
the nominal term spread increases, expected excess returns on nominal bonds increase.
The evidence against the real and nominal EH suggests that increases in the yields
of long-term bonds, whether real or nominal, do not necessarily imply that expected
future short-term interest rates have risen. The increase in yields, or the decline in
bond prices, could be the result of an increase in the risk of long-term bonds and
the risk premium that investors demand for holding them. Thus investors should
be cautious in interpreting increasing yields in long-term bonds as a signal of future
higher interest rates.
In recent work, Campbell, Sunderam, and Viceira (2010) show that bond risk
premia can move over time and take either sign depending on whether investors see
bonds as safe assets or risky assets. Our estimates show significant variation over
time of real and nominal bond risk premia, with periods of positive bond risk premia
and periods of negative bond risk premia, suggesting a changing investor perception
of the risk of real and nominal bonds.

18

In particular, the risk premium on TIPS has been large on average since they
were first issued in 1997, more so than the average risk premium on nominal Treasury
bonds, but there have been periods where it has been negative, notably the period
between 2004 and the onset of the financial crisis. The historical large positive average
of the TIPS risk premium appears to be driven by two particular periods: the years
following the creation of TIPS in the late 1990’s and most recently during the recent
financial crisis. Campbell, Shiller, and Viceira (2009) and Pflueger and Viceira (2010)
show evidence that these episodes are linked to periods in which the TIPS market was
particularly illiquid, and investors might have demanded a large liquidity premium
for holding them.
Our estimates also suggest that investors demand a risk premium on nominal
bonds that also varies over time. Consistent with the evidence in Campbell, Sunderam
and Viceira (2010), this premium might reflect the changing perception of inflation
risk by investors.
Our results suggest several directions for future research. First, they suggest a
more detailed analysis of the economic sources of risk in real and nominal bonds, along
the lines of Campbell, Sunderam, and Viceira (2010). Second, one could also explore
if the return predictability in the inflation-indexed bond market is the result of price
pressure and supply imbalances caused by limited arbitrage and preferred-habitat
investors in the bond market, along the lines of the preferred-habitat hypothesis of
Modigliani and Sutch (1966), formalized in Vayanos and Vila (2009) and Greenwood
and Vayanos (2008, 2009).
Arguably the inflation-indexed bond market is a natural candidate to look for segmentation eﬀects in the bond market. Just as investors might diﬀer in their preference
for bond maturities, they might also diﬀer in their preference for holding inflationindexed or nominal bonds. For example, some investors such as traditional definedbenefit pension funds in the US with a mature liability structure have liabilities which
are mostly nominal, while other investors such as less mature defined-benefit pension
funds or individuals investing for retirement face liabilities which are mostly indexed.
Pflueger and Viceira (2010) further explore this hypothesis.
Finally, it would be interesting to explore the implications of our findings for
portfolio management and pension investing and how these implications vary by investment horizon and the investor’s share of real and nominal liabilities.
