The Prewar Business Cycle Reconsidered:
New Estimates of Gross National Product, 1869-1918

ABSTRACT

This paper shows that the existing estimates of prewar gross national

product exaggerate the size of cyclical fluctuations. The source of the
exaggeration is that the original Kuznets estimates are based on the
assumption that GNP moves one—for—one with commodity output valued at

producer prices. New estimates of GNP for 1869—1918 are derived using the
estimated aggregate relationship between GNP and commodity output for the

interwar and postwar eras. The new estimates of GNP indicate that the
business cycle is only slightly more severe in the pre—Worid War I era
than in the post—World War II era.

INTRODUCTION

The existing estimates of gross national product for the seventy years
before World War II have perhaps done more to shape economists' perceptions of

prewar business cycles than any other macroeconomic series. The historical GNP
data have been analyzed in great detail and are constantly cited in research on

prewar fluctuations in economic activity. Hence, much of what economists
believe about prewar cyclical fluctuations is derived directly from the cyclical

behavior of prewar GNP. As a result, the accuracy of the prewar estimates of
GNP is one of the main determinants of the accuracy of our views are about the
prewar cycle.

The importance of the prewar estimates of GNP has, if anything, increased

in recent years. Economists interested in a variety of cyclical relationships

have recently included the historical GNP series in their analyses. Much work
has been done, for example, on the changing severity of cycles over time.
Studies by Baily (1978) and DeLong and Suimners (1984) use prewar GNP movements

to argue that cycles have become less severe in the postwar era. Much current
research also concerns the changing cyclical relationship of prices and output
(see, for example, Schultze, 1981, and Gordon, 1982) and money and output (see,

for example, Friedman and Schwartz, 1982). In all these studies the existing
historical estimates of GNP play a key role in the analysis.
While the short-term cyclical behavior of the prewar GNP series has been
analyzed in detail, the accuracy of the existing prewar estimates of GNP for

-2-

such cyclical analyses has rarely been discussed. The standard estimates of GNP
before 1929 are still those derived by Simon Kuznets. Several economists have
amended the Kuznets series, most notably Robert Gailman and John Kendrick, but
these amendments have not changed the cyclical behavior of the Kuznets series.
Most of the alterations of Kuznets's series concentrate on correcting the longterm trend of the prewar GNP series or making the Kuznets series conceptually

similar to the modern Department of Commerce GNP series. Few economists have
questioned whether the Kuznets estimates reflect cyclical movements accurately.
There is reason to believe, however, that the representation of cyclical

movements in the Kuznets estimates should be critically examined. Kuznets
clearly never intended for his estimates of GNP to be used for the analysis of

short-term cyclical movements. While he is very careful about determining
long-run movements of various series, but he is less careful about cyclical

movements. Annual movements in various components of GNP are often derived by
simply interpolating by means of another series, without taking into account the
actual cyclical relationship between the series being created and the interpo-

lating series. As a result, it is very likely that the existing GNP estimates
are not adequate for the detailed cyclical analysis to which they are being put
today.

Kuznets himself believed that his annual series did not represent cyclical

movements accurately. He states in Capital in the American Economy that the
version of his prewar estimates of GNP that are most frequently used today
"would not be acceptable measures of the amplitude of short-term changes"

(Kuznets, 1961, p. 546). He repeatedly warns readers not to use his data for
short-term cyclical comparisons and urges them to use the data in five-year
moving average form.

—3—

This paper examines Kuznets's pre-1918 GNP series and finds that Kuznets's

caveats concerning the accuracy of the annual estimates are justified. There is
evidence that Kuznets's methods accentuate the size of cyclical movements in the

prewar GNP series. The basic problem with the Kuznets estimates is that they
are derived almost entirely from data on commodity output at producer prices.
Total output at consumer prices, including the value added in transportation and

distribution, is essentially assumed to move proportionately with commodity

output at producer prices. This, however, may not be true. A variety of
interwar and postwar evidence shows that gross national product moves less over

the cycle than does commodity output. If the same is true in the prewar era,
then Kuznets's series will exaggerate cyclical fluctuations.

Because the existing estimates of GNP may not be accurate for the
short-term cyclical analysis to which most economists wish to put them, I derive

what I believe is a more accurate prewar GNP series for 1869-1918. I create a
new series by explicitly modeling the fact that GNP does not move as much over

the cycle as does commodity output. Data from the interwar and postwar eras are
used to estimate the relationship between GNP and commodity output. In estimating this relationship, the sensitivity of cyclical movements in GNP to cyclical
movements in commodity output is allowed to change over time.

I then use the

resulting time-varying sensitivity estimate to convert pre-1918 data on commodi-

ty output into estimates of GNP for this period. In this derivation I do not
alter the Kuznets/Gallman estimates of long-run trend GNP. Rather, I change
only the representation of short-term cyclical fluctuations.

The cyclical properties of the new estimates of GNP that I derive are very

different from those of the standard GNP series. The pre-1918 business cycle
appears to be much less severe in the new data than in the existing Kuzuets

series. As a result, the decline in the severity of the business cycle between

-4-

the pre-1918 and the postwar eras is also much smaller than is typically be-

lieved. In fact, the average amplitude of the cycle for 1869-1918 using the new
data is only slightly larger than the average amplitude for 1947-1983.
This reworking of the historical estimates of GNP is organized as follows.

Section I describes the Kuznets estimates of GNP. Section II discusses the
possible problems with these data and provides empirical evidence that the

Kuznets estimates are excessively volatile. Section III suggests a new method
for deriving annual estimates of prewar GNP and presents the new series.
Section IV examines the basic volatility characteristics of the new GNP series
and analyzes the degree of stabilization between the pre-World War I and
post-World War II eras.

SECTION I

KUZNETS'S ESTIMATES OF PREWAR GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT

The first step in forming new estimates of prewar gross national product is

to analyze the existing historical estimates. It is important to discover
whether there is reason to believe that the existing GNP data do not measure

short-term cyclical fluctuations correctly. In this section I describe the

methods that Kuznets uses to estimate real prewar GNP. I also discuss briefly
the revisions of Kuznets's estimates suggested by Galiman and Kendrick.
Kuznets provides estimates of gross national product and its components for

1869-1938. For the most part his estimates after 1928 have been superseded by
independent estimates by the Department of Conmierce. For the period before 1928
Kuznets derives several versions of GNP estimates and uses different methods for
various subperiods.

For the period after 1919, the Kuznets estimates are derived using the

income-payments approach. These estimates are described and presented in
Kuznets's book National Income and its Components 1919-1938 (1941). While the
accuracy of the GNP data after 1919 has not been thoroughly established, there

is reason to believe that this series is relatively accurate. For the period
after 1919 Kuznets has ample income data for most sectors and uses methods very

similar to those used by the Commerce Department after 1929. Therefore, it is

-6-

likely that the Kuznets data for 1919-1928 are not substantially worse than the
Commerce Department data after 1929.
For the period 1869-1918 Kuznets does not have the income data necessary to

derive income-side estimates of GNP. As a result, he must use different methods
to construct data for this period. Kuznets actually forms two annual series for
1869-1918 which he identifies as the components series and the regression

series. Both these series are derived by what can best be described as the

product-side approach. Both use data on commodity output to estimate GNP. The
two series differ in how they convert this base data into estimates of GNP and
at how fine a level of disaggregation the conversion is made.

The pre-1918 series are described in two sources. National Product since
1869 (1946) describes the derivation of decadal averages of GNP. These decadal
averages form the long-term trend for both the components series and the regres-

sion series. The annual components and regression series are described in
Capital in the American Economy (1961). Only some of the actual data are

published. The components series for 1869-1918 is only published in five-year
moving average form. The annual regression series is published in Capital in
the American Economy only for the period 1889-1918.
Because the GNP estimates before 1918 are based on much less data than are
the later estimates and are derived using methods that are quite different from
those used after 1919, it is reasonable to be more suspicious of the earlier

estimates than of the later series. For this reason, this study focuses on the
quality of the GNP data before 1918. It analyzes both the components series and
the regression series for the period 1869-1918 to see if Kuznets's methods may
have yielded GNP estimates that misrepresent cyclical movements.

—7—

1. Components Series
The Kuznets components series for 1869-1918 is by far the more important of
the two series to analyze. It is the one that is most cosinonly used in modern

econometric analyses. This fact may seem odd given that it has only been
published by Kuznets in moving-average form. The reason for its widespread use
is that it forms the basis of the widely used Kendrick estimates of GNP (see

Kendrick, 1961). Kendrick adjusts the Kuznets components series for 1889-1918
to be conceptually similar to the post-1929 Department of Couunerce series.

While Kendrick's adjustments are quite important for classifying aggregate GNP
into its various components and for determining the level of output in wartime,
his correction factors do not change the cyclical properties of Kuznets's

components series. This fact can be seen by comparing the cyclical movements in
the Kendrick GNP series to those in the Kuznets components series. This comparison shows that cyclical movements are very similar in the two series.1

The same is true of other modifications of Kuznets's series. Friedman and
Schwartz present estimates of real net national product back to 1869 in their book

Monetary Trends in the United States and the United Kingdom (1982). This series
is a combination of the Kuznets components series and revisions to some individ-

ual components of GNP prepared by Robert Gallman (see Gallman, 1966). While the
trend of this series is quite different from that of the Kuznets components

series, the cyclical movements are nearly identical.2 Gallman's revisions are
primarily revisions of decada]. averages, not of annual movements. Again,
therefore, the accuracy of the representation of cyclical movements in the
Kuznets components series is the key determinant of the accuracy of the cyclical
properties of this important revision of Kuznets's data.
The base data underlying the Kuznets components series come from a study by

William H. Shaw entitled Value of Conodity Output since 1869 (1947). Shaw uses

-8-

data from the Census of Manufactures to derive comprehensive benchmark estimates

of commodity output for various census years starting in 1869. He then forms
annual estimates of commodity output for 1889-1938 by interpolating between

benchmark observations by various annual series. The annual data come from a
plethora of state reports and industry publications. Shaw presents commodity
output data for a variety of major and minor subgroups valued in current and in
1913 prices.

Kuznets extends the annual Shaw series on commodity output to cover the

earlier period 1869-1888. He uses annual series similar to those used by Shaw
to interpolate between Shaw's census year benchmarks for 1869, 1879, and 1889.

Kuznets also transforms Shaw's data on real commodity output to correspond to a
1929 base year rather than a 1913 base year. While Kuznets's contribution to
the derivation of the basic commodity output data is substantial, in what
follows I refer to the Shaw/Kuznets series on real finished commodity output

simply as the Shaw series. I do this primarily to distinguish the commodity
3

output data from the Kuznets GNP series.

It is important to be very clear about what the Shaw series does and does

not cover. The Shaw series appears to be a very good compilation of data on the
value of finished commodity output. This series provides a good measure of the
gross value of finished commodity output valued at producer prices. However,
this series does not include the value added to a good after it reaches its

final physical state. Because goods are valued at producer prices, the value
added associated with transportation and distribution is excluded. Furthermore,
this series also excludes many components of GNP not represented by commodity
output such as the flow of services to consumers and the value of new
construction.

-9-

Kuznets's derivation of the components GNP series centers on converting the

commodity output data into estimates of GNP. In this transformation Kuznets

uses very little data other than the Shaw series. For the components series
Kuznets makes the transformation from commodity output to GNP at a fairly

disaggregate level. He derives estimates of the flow of goods to consumers and
gross capital formation. For the flow of goods to consumers he estimates the
flow of four categories of goods: perishables, semidurables, durables, and
services. For gross capital formation he estimates construction, the flow of
producer durables, the change in total inventories, and the change in net claims

held by foreigners. For all the components of GNP Kuznets first derives estimates of real quantities and then converts them to nominal estimates by means of

a price index for that component. For this reason, I only discuss the procedures he uses to derive estimates of real GNP.4
Though he is working at a disaggregate level, Kuznets's methods are quite

similar for three categories. For the flow of perishable, semidurable and
durable goods, Kuznets's problem is to convert the Shaw series on commodity
output valued in 1929 producer prices to the value of the flow of goods to

consumers at the cost to them in 1929 dollars. To do this, Kuznets begins by
taking the ratio of the average- flow of a category of goods to consumers to

average commodity output in that category for overlapping decades. He then
forms a series of the linear trend of this ratio.

For the most part, the

decadal averages of the flow of goods to consumers are formed by scaling up the

decadal averages of commodity output. The scale factors are determined by an
analysis of the trends in distributive margins and transportation charges. This
analysis is described in National Product Since 1869.
To form the annual series on the flow of a category of goods to consumers
in 1929 prices, Kuznets multiplies the trend ratio of the flow of goods to

-10-

consumers to commodity output in a given category by commodity output in that

category. The key assumption used in the derivation of the annual series is
that the relationship between the flow of goods to consumers and commodity

output does not vary over the cycle. This is the same as assuming that the
components of the flow of goods to consumers not included in commodity output
valued in producer prices, primarily the value added in transportation and
distribution, move one-for-one with commodity output.

Kuznets's methods for other sectors use similar assumptions. Estimates of
the flow of gross producer durables and total construction form the main compo-

nents of Kuznets's series on capital formation. Both these series are estimated
in ways completely analogous to those for the flow of goods to consumers. For
producer durables, the Shaw series on the output of producer durables at producer prices is multiplied by the trend ratio of the flow of producer durables to

ultimate users to commodity output. For construction, Kuznets forms the trend
ratio of construction output to the output of construction materials by linearly

interpolating between decadal averages. This trend ratio is then multiplied by
the annual Shaw series on the output of construction materials in 1929 prices to

form an annual series on total construction output. Again, the key assumption
used by Kuznets is that the relationship between commodity output at producer
prices and total product does not vary over the cycle.
Whereas for most pieces of GNP Kuznets uses simple linear interpolation by
commodity output, he uses a different method for measuring components of GNP not
directly involving commodities such as the flow of services to consumers or the
net change in inventories.

For these series he estimates the actual sensitiv-

ity of the component in question to commodity output or to the flow of goods to

consumers in a period for which he has good data on both items. He then uses

—11—

the estimated sensitivity to transform pre-1918 data on commodity output or
consumption into estimates of the needed components.

Kuznets's method for estimating the flow of services provides an example of

this procedure. Kuznets has reasonably good data on the flow of both goods and
services to consumers for 1919-1941. He calculates the trend level of the two
series for this period by connecting overlapping decadal averages. He then
regresses the deviation of the flow of services from trend on the deviation of

the flow of commodities to consumers from trend. The parameter estimates are
then used to create fitted values for 1869-1918 where independent estimates of

services do not exist. In creating the fitted values, Kuznets uses his pre-1918
estimates of the flow of goods to consumers. As discussed before, these estimates are themselves created using only a very simple filter of commodity output
valued in producer prices.

There are two possible problems with this procedure. The first is that the
sensitivity estimate that is used to convert data on consumer expenditures on

goods into estimates of consumer expenditures on services is much higher than

expected. While the coefficient that Kuznets uses is substantially less than
one, it is much larger than the sensitivity estimate for other sample periods.
For example, in the postwar era the relationship between consumer expenditures

on goods and consumer expenditures on services is actually negative.5 As a
result, the Kuznets prewar estimates of the flow of services may move too much
over the cycle.

A second problem is that Kuznets's procedure involves estimating the
relationship between true data on consumer expenditures on services and true

data on consumer expenditures on goods in the interwar era. He then uses the
sensitivity estimate to form prewar estimates of services. The possible flaw in
this procedure is that the base data on the flow of goods to consumers may not

-12-

be uniformly good between the pre-1918 era and the 1919-1941 period. From the
description of the methods used to form the pre-1918 consumption estimates it is
clear that these estimates may be excessively volatile because they are formed

using the assumption that the flow of goods to consumers moves one-for-one with

commodity output. If this is true, then using the coefficient based on accurate
consumption data will pass on too much of the movement in the flawed data on the

flow of goods to consumers to the estimates of the flow of services. The
resulting estimates of the flow of services to consumers could thus be excessively volatile.

2. Regression Series
The second GNP series that Kuznets creates for the period 1869-1918 is

called the regression series. The regression series is derived by estimating
the aggregate relationship between real commodity output and real GNP for the

period 1909-1938. This relationship is then used to convert Shaw's pre-1918
data on commodity output into estimates of GNP. This method attempts to take
into account at the aggregate level the fact that GNP does not vary as much over
the cycle as does commodity output valued in producer prices.

The actual derivation of the regression series is not complicated. Kuznets
first forms estimates of trend GNP and trend commodity output. To do this he
calculates averages for overlapping decades and uses these to represent trend

GNP or commodity output for the midpoint of the decade. Annual trend values are

derived by linear interpolation between these midpoints.6 GNP and commodity
output for 1909-1938 are then expressed as percentage deviations from trend.
Kuznets then fits "a freehand regression curve" to a scatter plot of the deviations of real commodity output and real GNP from trend (Kuznets, 1961, p. 537).
This curve is used to form fitted values for the pre-1918 era.

—13—

Though Kuznets asserts that the regression curve cannot be expressed as a
simple mathematical function, it is actually very close to a simple linear
regression. One can replicate Kuznets's pre-1918 regression series very accurately using the results of a simple linear regression of the percentage deviations of GNP from trend on the percentage deviations of the Shaw series on total

commodity output from trend and a constant. The actual parameter estimates are:

gnp = -0.001 + 0.896 co +
(0.046)
(0.005)

where small letters denote percentage deviations from trend.7 The fitted values
from applying this relationship to the pre-1918 era differ from Kuznets's
regression estimates usually by less than one-half of one percent and only for
two years by more than one percent.
From this representation of the derivation of the regression series it is

clear that it has much in common with the components series. Though the two GNP
series are derived at very different levels of aggregation and using somewhat
different assumptions, both series suggest that the cyclical movements in GNP

move very closely with those in commodity output. The components series for the
most part assumes that GNP moves one-for-one with commodity output. The regression series uses the estimated sensitivity of GNP to commodity output over the

period 1909-1938 to estimate GNP for 1869-1918. The assumption derived from
this procedure is that cyclical movements in GNP are 90 percent as large as
those in commodity output.

While the basic procedures underlying the components and regression series

are quite similar, there are obvious differences between the two series. The
regression series is derived at a much more aggregate level than is the compo-

nents series. Also, the regression methodology removes the random movements in

-14-

GNP

that

are not perfectly correlated with commodity output. Finally, the

regression series is derived using the assunption that the deviations from trend
of GNP move 0.9-for-one with the deviations of

commodity output from trend

rather than one-for-one as is assumed in the derivation of the components

series. The comparison of volatility properties of the two series given in
Section IV shows that the effect of these differences

is exactly what one would

predict. The regression series is consistently less volatile than the components series. However, the magnitude of the difference in volatility is small
and the prewar regression series is still substantially more volatile than the
actual postwar GNP series.

—15—

SECTION II

EXCESS VOLATILITY IN TUE KIJZNETS GNP ESTIMATES

The description of the Kuznets components and regression estimates of GNP
points out a key similarity between the two series:

both data sets are derived

by postulating that the deviations of GNP from trend move very closely with the

deviations of commodity output from trend. This section analyzes the accuracy
of this key assumption underlying both Kuznets GNP series for 1869-1918.

1. Possible Sources of Excess Volatility
At an abstract level there is reason to suspect that both of Kuznets's

procedures yield estimates of GNP that overstate the size of cyclical movements.
The key problem is that commodity output represents a very cyclically sensitive

portion of GNP. Data on commodity output valued at producer prices do not
include the pieces of GNP that are typically considered to be the less cyclically sensitive components of total national output such as trade, transportation,

and services. As a result, assuming that the total GNP has cyclical movements
identical (or nearly so) to those in commodity output yields a GNP series that
overstates the size of cyclical fluctuations.

That commodity output is an unrepresentative fraction of GNP is for the

most part a simple empirical regularity in postwar data. However, this regularity is plausible at a theoretical level. First, in the case of consumer

-16-

expenditures on services it is likely that the demand

invariant to the state of the cycle. Except under

for many services is

extreme circumstances one

would not expect expenditures on haircuts or physicians' services to fluctuate

dramatically. The same is not true of expenditures on commodities (especially
durable goods) where demand may not have a strong time-specific character.
Hence, one would not expect expenditures on services to vary closely with
commodity output.

Fixed costs may provide an explanation of why the trade and transportation
component of consumer expenditures on goods does not move one-for-one with

commodity output valued at producer prices. It is certainly possible that fixed
costs for trade and transportation firms are

relatively larger compared to

variable costs than they are for manufacturing firms. This could be due, for
example, to the fact that retail firms are

typically quite small. As a result,

overhead expenses may be very large relative to labor costs.
If this is true, then one would expect the value added in transportation
and distribution to be less cyclically volatile

than commodity output. In a

cyclical downturn, a retail distributor or a transportation firm may be unable
to cut costs proportionately with the decline in volume simply because variable

cost is a small fraction of total cost. In this case, the distributive margin
on each good will rise. As a result, the final gross value to consumers of the
commodity in question will not have fallen by as much as the value of the

commodity to producers. Hence consumer expenditures on commodities will tend to
be less cyclically volatile than commodity output valued at producer prices.

2. Evidence of Excess Volatility
While it is easy to construct stories about why GNP should not move
one-for-one with commodity output valued at producer prices, such stories do not

—17—

provide evidence that both the Kuznets GNP series are in fact excessively

volatile. However, estimates of the actual sensitivity of the deviations of GNP
from trend to the deviations of commodity output from trend from periods where
good data are available on both quantities does suggest that Kuznets's assumptions of a one-to-one relationship or a .9-to-one relationship are erroneous.
To examine the validity of Kuznets's assumptions I regress the deviations
of aggregate GNP from trend on the deviations of aggregate commodity output from
trend for various time periods. That is, I estimate the equation

(1)

where gnP is the logarithm of aggregate real gross national product, co is the
logarithm of aggregate real commodity output, and bars over a variable denote

trend values. As is discussed in detail in Section III, trend values are
calculated using piecewise linear trends between years that are identified as
times of full employment (rather than times of exceptionally low unemployment).
This method yields estimates of trend values that correspond to normal output,
not to peak or potential output.

The earliest time period that can be examined begins in 1909. For
8

1909-1918 Kuznets provides very rough income-side estimates of GNP.

While the

estimates surely have a great deal of random measurement error, they should be

free of the cyclical exaggeration present in the product-side estimates. Hence,
they should provide a consistent estimate of the sensitivity of cyclical movements in GNP to the cyclical movements in commodity output.
The relationship between GNP and commodity output can be examined in the

postwar era as well. Data on commodity output valued at producer prices are
available from the Federal Reserve Board in the series titled the gross value of

-18-

final products.9 Since this series is only available after 1954, I also examine
the relationship between GNP and the FRB value-added index of final goods

production over the entire postwar era. The similarity in the results using
both the gross value and value-added series for the same sample period suggests
that this approximation is very close.
The coefficient estimates from the regression of the cyclical movements in
GNP on the cyclical movements in commodity output for various time periods are

shown in Table 1. For most sample periods over the interval 1909-1983 the
coefficient estimate is substantially below 0.9 or 1. It generally ranges
between 0.6 and 0.7. The coefficient estimates for the postwar era are somewhat
smaller than those for the interwar era.
The one exception to this pattern involves any sample period that includes

the Great Depression. When the 1930s are included in any regression, even a
pooled sample covering both the interwar and postwar eras, the coefficient

estimate is approximately 0.9 or higher. This result explains why Kuznets in
deriving his regression estimates of GNP found that GNP and commodity output had

very similar cyclical properties. He specifically estimated the relationship
between the two series over a period that was dominated by the Great Depression.
There can be little doubt that the results from the Depression are anoma-

lous. For no other sample period is the coefficient estimate anywhere near as
high. As Table 1 shows, the relationship between GNP and commodity output is
very stable in periods outside the Depression. In both the periods 1909-1918

and 1919-1928 the coefficient estimate is approximately 0.65. In contrast, the
coefficient estimate for 1929-1938 is 0.97. These results are completely robust
to minor changes in the definition of decades.

That the Great Depression should show a much higher sensitivity of movements in GNP to movements in commodity output than do other periods is not

surprising. Most theories of consumer and producer behavior suggest that agents
will respond much differently to a particularly long and severe depression than

they will to a recession that is expected to be mild or brief. For example,
while consumers will typically smooth their expenditures on services, in a very

severe depression they are likely to reduce those expenditures. This could be
due to revisions in estimates of permanent income or to increasingly binding

liquidity constraints. Similarly, while distributive margins typically rise in

a recession, they may actually fall in a long and severe depression. This could
be caused by bankruptcies among transportation and retail establishments that

allow remaining firms to have sufficient volume to cover fixed costs. Both of
these responses to severe economic decline can explain why GNP moves much more
closely with commodity output during the 1930s than during any other period.
The fact that the sensitivity of movements in GNP to movements in commodity output for most sample periods excluding the Great Depression is substantial-

ly below that assumed by Kuznets suggests that both the Kuznets components and

regression series are excessively volatile. This is especially true given how
anomalous the decline of the 1930s is in comparison to the economic fluctuations

of the late 1800s and early 1900s. Judging from the cyclical behavior of
commodity output, the percentage decline in production during the Great Depression was nearly three times as large as the percentage decline in the worst

depression of the 1869—1918 period)0 Hence it is much more reasonable to
believe that the relationship between GNP and commodity output is more like that

exhibited in both the interwar and postwar eras than during the 1930s. In this
case, GNP would be far less volatile than the Kuznets estimates suggest.

3. The Decline in the Ratio of Commodity Output to GNP
While the available evidence suggests that the Kuznets series are

-20-

excessively volatile, conclusive proof is impossible to find. Most importantly
one must worry that GNP moved more closely over the cycle in the period

1869-1918 than it did in the interwar and postwar eras. It is possible that
structural changes in the economy caused the sensitivity of GNP to commodity

output to have been larger in the prewar era than in the postwar era. If this
is true, then Kuznets's estimates of prewar GNP may not overstate cycles as much
as the previous evidence suggests.
The prime structural change that might have caused the relationship between
GNP and commodity output to change over time is the relative decline in the

commodity sector of the economy. If commodity output represented a larger
fraction of GNP in the pre-1918 period than in later periods, then it is possible that GNP should move more closely with commodity output in the earlier
period than it does today.

Two observations on the decline of the commodity sector suggest that this

change is not a major cause for concern. The first is that the decline in the
size of the commodity sector is a modern occurrence. Furthermore, the decline
in the size of the commodity sector within the modern period has been quite

small. The second observation is that the change in the relative size of the
commodity sector between the interwar and postwar eras has little effect on the
sensitivity of cyclical fluctuations in GNP to fluctuations in commodity output.
Evidence on the changing share of commodity output in GNP is of differing

quality. For the period after 1909 we possess independent estimates of both
real GNP and real commodity output valued in producer prices. Hence one can
simply examine the ratio of these two series. The ratio of commodity output to
GNP in selected years beginning in 1910 is given in Table 2. The years shown
are the same benchmark years used to construct the piecewise linear trends

discussed earlier. The ratio shows a definite downward trend over time in the

share of commodity output in GNP. However, it is crucial to observe that the
magnitude of the decline is quite small. Over the period 1909-1983 the ratio
only fell from approximately 0.46 to 0.35. This suggests that even if this same
downward trend were present from 1869 on, the ratio of commodity output to GNP in

the prewar era would not be dramatically larger than it is in the postwar era.
Fragments of prewar evidence suggest that the decline in the ratio of
commodity output to GNP in the pre-1918 era was less pronounced than the modern

behavior of this ratio suggests. In deriving the components series on GNP,
Kuznets assumed that the ratio of commodity output to GNP in various sectors
from 1869-1918 was the same as the ratio of the two quantities over the period

1919-1928. Kuznets based this assumption on the behavior of the shares of total
income accruing to workers in the transportation and distribution sectors in

census years in the prewar era. He felt that while the income studies showed "a
mild downward trend" in the ratio of commodity output to GNP, the trend was both
slight enough and variable enough that it was best to assume that the ratio of
commodity output to GNP was essentially flat over the period 1869-1929 (Kuznets,
1946, p. 67).

A study by Harold Barger on the role of distribution in the American

economy confirms Kuzuets's belief to a large degree. Barger finds that as the
cost of distribution rose slowly, the cost of transpQrting goods from producers

to distributors fell steadily. As a result, "the ratio of distribution cost
plus freight charges to producers' value scarcely rose at all" between the Civil

War and the Great Depression (Barger, 1955, p. 63). Barger does suggest that
there may nevertheless have been a slight fall in the ratio of commodity output
to GNP over time simply because more goods began to enter the distribution
process rather than remain on the farm or within the household (Barger, 1955,

-22-

p.64). However the implied change in the ratio of real commodity output valued
in producer prices to real GNP between 1869 and 1929 is still very small.
The Barger and Kuznets results are important because they suggest that
there is little reason to suspect that the relationship between GNP and commodi-

ty output changed significantly between the prewar and interwar eras. Since the
ratio of commodity output to GNP declined only very slightly (if at all) between
these two periods, it is hard to believe that the sensitivity of GNP to commodity output was much different between the two periods.
One further piece of evidence on the excess volatility of the Kuznets GNP
series is the effect of changes in the ratio of commodity output to GNP on the

sensitivity of cyclical movements in GNP to movements in commodity output. As
mentioned earlier, the ratio of commodity output to GNP fell somewhat between
1909-1983. The coefficient estimates shown in Table 1 suggest,. however, that
this fall did not cause dramatic changes in the measured sensitivity of GNP to

commodity output. For example, the coefficient estimate for 1909-1918 is 0.66
while the estimate for 1973-1983 is 0.59. This implies that even if the ratio
of commodity output to GNP were noticeably larger in the prewar era than it is
in the interwar and postwar eras, the estimated sensitivity of GNP to commodity

output would be substantially lower than 0.9 or 1. Hence, Kuznets's GNP estimates would still be excessively volatile.

-23-

SECTION III

NEW ESTIMATES OF PREWAR GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT

The preceding descriptions and analysis of the two Kuznets series suggest
that the existing estimates of prewar GNP do not measure cycles correctly.
Rather, both the Kuznets components and regression series exaggerate the size of

cyclical fluctuations in the period 1869-1918. Given that there are problems
with the Kuznets estimates, it is only natural to attempt to create better

estimates of prewar GNP. Since none of the analysis has challenged the accuracy
of the trend values of GNP, the derivation of new estimates presented in this
section will concentrate on improving only the representation of cyclical
movements.

1. Overview of Methods
In deriving new estimates of prewar GNP the most obvious problem is a lack

of data. Obviously, modern researchers are forced to estimate prewar GNP
precisely because we do not have data on many of the components of total output.
Kuznets is quite convincing that we possess little data on the components of GNP
other than comprehensive figures on the value of commodity output in producer

prices. Data on distributive margins, the change in inventories, and consumer
expenditures on services are very scarce and subject to exceedingly large

margins of error. While it is possible that new and extensive research could

-24-

provide adequate direct estimates of these components of GNP, for now it is
necessary to assume that the main information we possess about movements in GNP
is provided by the available data on commodity output.
Given the limitations on data, it is thus sensible to view the creation of
new estimates of GNP as finding the best method for transforming data on commod-

Ity output into estimates of GNP. If one views the problem this way, it is
clear that one should use some sort of regression technique. Simply imposing a
one-to-one relationship between the two series will not yield the best estimates

of GNP. As Friedman shows in his article on linear interpolation, using some
estimate of the relationship between the series to be created and the interpolating series (perhaps derived from a fragment of data or from a different
sample period) will, in most circumstances, yield a more accurate series than
simply imposing a one-to-one relationship (Friedman, 1962).
The method that I use to derive new estimates of prewar GNP corresponds

very closely to Kuznets's aggregate regression technique. I assume that the
deviations of aggregate real GNP from trend are correlated with the deviations

of aggregate real commodity output from trend. The actual sensitivity of
cyclical movements in GNP to cyclical movements in commodity output is estimated
from a sample period that includes both the interwar and postwar eras, but
excludes the Great Depression.

The main improvement that I make in Kuznets's procedure is to allow the
measured sensitivity of aggregate GNP to aggregate commodity output to change

over time. As shown in Section II, there is some evidence that aggregate GNP is
less sensitive to movements in aggregate commodity output in the postwar era

than in the interwar era. This is probably due to the modest decline that has
occurred in the ratio of commodity output to GNP. Since the same trend may
extend to the pre-1918 period as well, it is useful to allow the estimated

-25-

sensitivity to decline over time as well.11 By doing so, one can derive an
estimate of the sensitivity of GNP to commodity output for the period 1869-1918
that represents this time period more accurately.

The decision to create a new aggregate regression series is a choice that

should be defended. The obvious alternative procedure is to employ regression
techniques at a disaggregate level. For example, one could estimate the relationship between GNP and commodity output for each sector and use these rela-

tionships to create new prewar GNP data. The obvious benefit of this approach
is that it allows the sensitivity of GNP to commodity output to vary across

sectors. Furthermore, to the extent that the relative size of sectors changes
over time, it allows the aggregate sensitivity of GNP to commodity output to
vary over time as well.

The main reason that I choose not to follow the disaggregate approach is
that by using a time-varying sensitivity estimate, the aggregate regression

methodology preserves the main benefit of the disaggregate approach. The key
argument in favor of the disaggregate approach is that it allows GNP to move

more closely with commodity output in the pre-1918 era when the noncommodity

components of GNP were slightly smaller. The modified aggregate regression
approach that I employ also allows the estimated sensitivity of GNP to commodity

output to be higher in the prewar era. However, it does so in a way that is
much more straightforward and much less time consuming than does the
disaggregate approach.

2. Specifics of the Deviation
The basic procedure that I use to create new GNP data is thus

straightforward. In some period when I have good aggregate data on both GNP and
commodity output I estimate the relationship between the deviations from trend

-28-

The choice of sample period is also influenced by the sensitivity analysis

of Section II. The regressions reported in Table 1 show that the relationship
between GNP and commodity output during the Great Depression was much different

than the relationship during any other time period. Since the Great Depression
appears to be a downturn of unprecedented magnitude, it is best not to let the
experience of the 1930s determine the relationship between GNP and commodity

output in the prewar era. Hence, I exclude the Great Depression from the sample
period over which I estimate equation (2).

Trend Values. The calculation of trend values for GNP and commodity output
is a third complicating factor in the derivation of new estimates of GNP. To
estimate equation (2) and form new estimates of GNP for 1869-1918, one must
specify trend values for both GNP and commodity output for the entire period

1869-1983. The methods that can be used are limited by the fact that the
procedures for forming trend values must be applicable to the pre-1918 period
for which we do not possess estimates of GNP that represent cycles accurately.
The method I use for calculating trend values involves interpolating

linearly

between benchmark estimates of the logarithms of GNP and commodity output.
Since the benchmark values chosen are generally only 8 to 12 years apart, this
method allows the trend of each series to change frequently over the period in
question.

In using piecewise—linear trends, the key step is deciding which years to

use as benchmarks. Often, researchers choose to connect peak years and thus
form an estimate of potential rather than trend GNP or commodity output (see,

for example, Gordon, 1982). For this study, I specifically choose years that
correspond only to trend output or unemployment at the natural rate rather than

to peak output. This was a necessary change because the existing Kuznets
estimates of prewar GNP accentuate the size of cyclical fluctuations. As a

-29—

result, the only years for which the pre-1918 GNP estimates are accurate are
years when the economy is neither below or above trend.

Deciding during which years the economy was on trend involves an admittedly

arbitrary and imperfect procedure. In choosing benchmark dates I use a mixture
of examining a plot of the data in logarithms and a qualitative knowledge of
which prewar and postwar years are typically considered to correspond to periods

of boom and recession. From the plot of the data I try to choose years that
correspond to points of mid-expansion in the business cycle. For the postwar
era I also use data on the unemployment rate to confirm that the years chosen do
correspond to conventional estimates of full, rather than over-full, employment.
The actual years chosen as benchmark estimates for both GNP and commodity

output are: 1869, 1874, 1884, 1891, 1902, 1910, 1918, 1924, 1937, 1947, 1955,
1962, 1972 and 1981.13 Figures 1 and 2 show the resulting trend values of GNP
and commodity output and the existing underlying actual data. From these
graphs, it should be clear that the years chosen as benchmarks do correspond

reasonably well to points of mid-expansion in the cycle.14 Another fact that
should be apparent from Figures 1 and 2 is that even relatively large changes in
the choice of benchmark years would not alter the trend values substantially.15

Data. The final issue to consider in deriving new estimates of prewar GNP
involves which data to use. For estimating the relationship between GNP and
commodity output in the interwar and postwar eras, the choice of data is fairly

obvious. For real GNP the Kuznets income-side estimates are used for 1909-1928.
The Commerce Department GNP series is used for 1955-1983. For real commodity
output, the Shaw series is used for 1909-1928. The Federal Reserve Board series
on the gross value of final products (amended to include the gross value of

construction materials) is used for 1955-1983. All data are expressed in terms
of constant dollars.

Notes and Sources: For 1869—1938 the Shaw/Kuznets series on commodity output
in 1929 prices is used. This series is published in Capital in the American
Economy (1961, Table R—2l, pp. 553—554). For 1954—1983 the Federal Reserve
Board series on the gross value of final products is used. I amend this series
to include the gross value of construction supplies. The gross value data for
1954—1967 (on a 1963 base) are available in Industrial Production, 1971 edition.
The data for 1967—1975 (on a 1972 base) are available in Industrial Production,

Board releases. The 1963 and 1972 base year series are combined using a ratio
splice based in 1967. Trend values are calculated using the procedures
described in the text.

-30-

In forming new estimates of prewar GNP, the choice of data is less

straightforward. For commodity output the Shaw series is the obvious series to

use. However, for calculating trend GNP there are some alternatives. One can
either use the original Kuznets series or one of the revisions of this series to
derive benchmark estimates.

Again, both commodity output and GNP are expressed in constant (1929) dollars.

3. Results
Parameter Estimates. The ultimate result of following the procedures
described is the derivation of new estimates of real GNP for 1869-1918. An
important intermediate step is the estimation of the time-varying relationship
between the deviations from trend of aggregate real GNP and aggregate real

commodity output. When equation (2) is estimated over the period 1909-1928 and
1955-1983 the parameter estimates are:

The coefficient estimates are perfectly sensible. They suggest that the
deviations from trend of GNP are substantially smaller than those of commodity
output and that the sensitivity of GNP to commodity output has declined over

time. However, the change in the coefficient over time is reasonably small.
According to the estimates, the time-varying coefficient measuring the sensitivity of GNP to commodity output fell from 0.664 in 1909 to 0.483 in 1983.

—31-

The presence of a nontrivial trend in the coefficient implies that the
coefficient one should use in converting prewar data on commodity output into

estimates of GNP is bigger than any of the coefficients one finds using an

interwar or postwar sample. Indeed, projecting the simple linear trend back in
time, the coefficient ranges between 0.763 in 1869 and 0.642 in 1918. By using
these time-varying estimates of the coefficient, one is able to capture the very
plausible decline in the sensitivity of GNP to commodity output.

New Estimates of Prewar GNP. The new estimates of prewar gross national
product that result from following the procedures described are given in Table

3. The new estimates cover the period 1869-1918 and represent real GNP in
constant (1929) dollars. I create new estimates of GNP for 1909-1918 despite
the fact that rough income-side estimates of GNP are available for this decade.
I do this because the data for the 1910s have sufficient measurement error that
using the new methods is likely to provide point estimates of GNP that are more

accurate than the original series. The best evidence for this proposition is
that Kuznets also chose to use his regression procedure to create estimates of
GNP for 1909-1918 rather than use the income-side series.

The new estimates of prewar GNP are graphed in Figure 3. For comparison,
the Kuznets/Gallman components series is also presented in Figure 3. Two
characteristics of the new series are apparent from the figure. The first is
that the new estimates of prewar GNP are identical to the Kuznets/Gallman

estimates in benchmark years. This is to be expected given the procedures used
to derive the new series. The second is that cyclical movements in the new
series are noticeably smaller than cyclical movements in the Kuznets/Gallman

series. This difference between the two series is analyzed in detail in Section
Iv.

The derivation of the new estimates is described in the text.

-32-

For anyone interested in using the new estimates, certain facts are

relevant. One is that the current estimates are in constant dollars. A nominal
series can be formed by multiplying the new estimates by the Kuznets implicit
price deflator series given in Friedman and Schwartz (1982, pp. 122-129).
Another is that the new GNP series is designed to be consistent with the origi-

nal Kuznets series after 1918. While the new estimates incorporate Galiman's
revisions to the trend of the Kuznets series before 1909, they are consistent

with the Kuznets data for the 1920s and 1930s. Thus, the new series can easily
be extended through 1938 using the Kuznets estimates of GNP in 1929 dollars
(Variant III) given in Capital in the American Economy (1961, Table R-2, p.
487).

While the new estimates are consistent with the Kuznets series after 1918,

they are not consistent with the modern Department of Commerce estimates. In
the derivation of the new estimates I abstract from the work of Kendrick and the
Department of Commerce that amends the Kuznets data to fit modern Department of

Commerce procedures. I do this for two reasons. The main one is that the
amended base data using Commerce Department concepts begin in 1889. Since the
goal to this paper is to form new data back to 1869, following Kendrick would
have required a tremendous amount of research before one could even begin to

analyze problems with cyclical representations. While the derivation of
Kendrick-like corrections for 1869-1888 is certainly a useful endeavor, it was
clearly out of the range of this study.

The second reason is that for cyclical analyses, the Kendrick/Commerce

Department corrections are of essentially no importance. These corrections
primarily involve the treatment of military expenditures. They also involve
separating government expenditures into a separate category rather than including them in the flow of goods to consumers and capital formation categories as

-33-

Kuznets does. There is nothing in the corrections that significantly changes
the cyclical properties of the underlying Kuznets components series. As a
result, they can be ignored for the purpose of deriving new GNP estimates that
measure cycles more accurately.

-34-

SECTION IV

VOLATILITY PROPERTIES OF THE NEW GNP SERIES

Having derived new estimates of GNP, it is natural to ask how these esti-

mates change one's perception of the prewar economy. Since the new estimates
are designed to measure short-term cyclical fluctuations more accurately than do

the original Kuznets estimates, the most interesting application is to analyze

the business cycle properties of the new GNP data. This section considers the
basic volatility properties of the prewar GNP series. Various measures of the
severity of cycles are used to compare Kuznets's GNP estimates, my new estimates, and postwar data on actual GNP.
The cyclical properties of the Kuznets components series are analyzed in

detail in existing studies. Several studies use the existing prewar GNP data to
argue that business cycles are more severe and the economy is in general more

volatile in the prewar era. This is certainly the case in two recent articles,
one by Martin Neil Baily (1978) and one by J. Bradford DeLong and Lawrence

Summers (1984). While neither of these studies uses Kuznets's data directly,
both use amended versions of prewar GNP data that derive their cyclical movements from the Kuznets components series.18
Both of these studies conclude that there has indeed been a dramatic

stabilization of the postwar economy. Even when the Great Depression is excluded, cyclical fluctuations in prewar GNP are nearly twice as large as

fluctuations in postwar GNP. However, the

discussion in Sections I and II

should make one skeptical of these results. That discussion shows that
there is
reason to believe that both the Kuznets

components series and the regression

series exaggerate cyclical movements in GNP. Given that the new estimates of
GNP are derived in such a way that they should represent cyclical movements
more
accurately, it is interesting to see if these estimates also show that cycles
were more severe in the prewar era.

1. Measures of Volatility
Table 4 shows three common

measures of volatility for the various GNP

series. I analyze the Kuznets/Gallman
sion series on real GNP,

components series and the Kuznets regres-

my new prewar estimates of real GNP, and the standard

Commerce Department series on postwar GNP in 1972 dollars. For the three
prewar
series I examine the volatility
properties over the period 1869-1918. For the
postwar series I use the sample period 1947-1983.
The first measure to consider is the

mean cyclical amplitude of the

detrended GNP series. This is obviously a measure of the severity of cycles in
the two periods. The various GNP series are detrended using the piecewise
linear trends discussed in Section III.

Peaks and troughs are defined by the

actual turning points in detrended commodity output.'9 Peaks and troughs
defined this way are somewhat different from NEER reference dates which are
derived using undetrended data.2°

Cycles with declines in GNP of less than two

percent are excluded from calculations of the

mean. The results, however, are

very similar when only cycles of less than one percent are excluded from the
calculation of the mean.

The results are quite striking. A comparison of the average amplitude of
the prewar components series and the actual postwar series shows the usual

This series can only be constructed for the period 1955-1983 because the commodity output data are only available after 1954. For comparison, the measures
of volatility for actual GNP for 1955-1983 are: Mean Cyclical Amplitude - .054;

CThe industrial production series used is a weighted combination of the FRB final

stylized fact. There appears to be a dramatic decline in the severity of cycles
between the prewar and postwar eras. The average amplitude of the prewar
Kuznets/Gallman components series is approximately 64 percent larger than that

of the postwar GNP series. This damping of business cycle fluctuations over
time is also apparent when one compares the Kuznets regression series to the

postwar GNP data. However, the degree of stabilization is somewhat smaller when
the regression series is used in place of the components series. The average
cyclical amplitude of the regression series is approximately 14 percent smaller

than the average amplitude of the components series. Thus, some of the apparent
volatility of the prewar economy is simply an artifact of the problem that
modern researchers have continued to use the components series despite Kuznets's

belief that the regression series provides the better measure of pre-1918
cyclical fluctuations.

The new estimates of prewar GNP are much less volatile than either the

Kuznets components or regression series. The average amplitude for the new GNP
series for 1869-1918 is 31 percent smaller than that of the Kuznets/Gallman
components series and 17 percent smaller than that of the Kuznets regression

series. The average cyclical amplitude of the new prewar GNP series is also
larger than that for the postwar Commerce Department series. The cyclical
amplitude of the new prewar series is 33 percent larger than that of the postwar

GNP series. From these results it is clear that the measured severity of
cyclical movements in the new prewar GNP series is approximately midway between
that of the prewar Kuznets/Gallman components series and the postwar Commerce
Department series.
The results using different measures of volatility are roughly similar to

those using the mean cyclical amplitude. I consider both the standard deviation
of the percentage changes in GNP and the standard deviation of deviations from

-37-

trend. These two measures are more indexes of general volatility than of
cyclical severity. Using these measures, the prewar Kuznets/Gallman components
series is again roughly twice as volatile as the actual postwar GNP series. The
Kuznets regression series is only slightly less volatile than the components

series.2' The new estimates of real prewar GNP are substantially less volatile
than either the prewar components or regression series. The standard deviations
of both percentage changes and deviations from trend for the new GNP series are
approximately halfway between those for the prewar Kuznets/Gallman components
series and those for the postwar GNP series.
One issue that arises in examining the standard deviations of the new GNP
series involves the fact that the new GNP estimates are derived as the forecast

values of a regression. As a result, one would expect the new prewar estimates
to have a lower standard deviation than a true GNP series would have just simply
because the variance of the residual has been suppressed. One way to gauge the
importance of this effect is to construct a GNP series for the postwar era using

the same methods as those used to create the new prewar estimates. Since this
constructed postwar series will also be the fitted values of a regression, it

too should have standard deviations that are biased downward. By comparing the
standard deviations of the actual and constructed postwar series, one can
estimate the magnitude of the possible bias.
The volatility properties of the constructed postwar GNP series are given

in Table 4. A comparison of the standard deviations of both percentage changes
and deviations from trend for the actual and constructed postwar series suggests

that the bias resulting from using fitted values is very small. The standard
deviation of percentage changes for 1955-1983 is only 4 percent smaller for the

constructed postwar estimates than for the actual data. While the variance of
the residual could certainly be larger in the prewar era, the simple postwar

-38-

comparison suggests that the standard deviation estimates of the new prewar GNP

series are not very biased. As a result, these measures of volatility probably
do provide a good indication of the amount of stabilization that has occurred
over time.

2. Interpretation of Results
The comparisons of the various measures of volatility suggest that economists may have greatly overstated the degree to which the U.S. economy has

stabilized over time. While the Kuznets/Gallman components series for 1869-1918
is by most measures approximately 69 percent more volatile than the Commerce
Department GNP series for 1947-1983, the new GNP series for 1869-1918 is on

average only 35 percent more volatile than the postwar series. This suggests
that almost exactly half of the often-noted stabilization of gross national
product over time disappears when the new estimates of prewar GNP are used in
the calculation.

While it is crucial to note that much of the observed-stabilization of GNP
is due to flaws in the original Kuznets data, it is also important to stress
that even the new estimates of prewar GNP reveal some stabilization between the

prewar and postwar eras. The business cycle before 1918 continues to look
somewhat more severe than the cycle after 1947 even when more accurate estimates

of prewar GNP are examined. However, the change over time now appears to have
been mild rather than dramatic.

It is useful to note that some of the remaining evidence of stabilization
may be due to the fact that in deriving the new estimates of prewar GNP, I have
deliberately erred on the side of creating a series that is too volatile rather

than too smooth. This tendency is most obvious in the use of a time-varying
estimate of the relationship between GNP and conmrndity output. Despite the

-39-

evidence of Kuznets and Barger that the ratio of commodity output to GNP was
roughly stable between 1869 and 1929, I allow the sensitivity estimate used to
create new data to be higher in the prewar era than in the interwar and postwar
eras.

Other steps in the derivation have also tended to overstate the volatility

of the new pre-1918 GNP series. For example, I have not taken into account the
possible measurement error in the prewar commodity output data. If early
commodity output is measured with error as Weir suggests, then using a sensitivity estimate derived using predominantly good postwar data will overstate

cyclical movements in prewar GNP. As a result, a comparison of the new prewar
estimates and the postwar GNP series will, if anything, overstate the amount of
stabilization of the business cycle that has occurred over time.
Given that the new prewar estimates of GNP reveal significantly less
stabilization over time it is useful to try to understand the source of the

results. The key fact to consider in this regard is that commodity output has

stabilized only very slightly over time. Table 4 reports various measures of
volatility for both the prewar Shaw series and the postwar Federal Reserve Board

data on real commodity output. These measures show that commodity output was
only 12 percent more volatile on average in the prewar era than in the postwar
era.

Given the slight stabilization in commodity output, one might reasonably

expect only a slight stabilization in GNP. Indeed, if the relationship between
GNP and commodity output had been stable between 1869 and 1983, GNP would also

have decreased in volatility by 12 percent. The new estimates of prewar GNP
show a 35 percent stabilization precisely because the relationship between GNP
and commodity output is allowed to have declined slightly over time as the

noncommodity sectors of the economy have expanded. The key point is that most

-40-

of the stabilization shown by the new series stems not from the underlying
commodity output data, but from assumptions and estimates about the relationship
between commodity output and GNP.

The same is true to a much larger degree for the original Kuznets esti-

mates. The dramatic stabilization shown by the Kuznets components and regression series is due almost entirely to Kuznets's assumption that GNP moved nearly
one-for-one with commodity output from 1869-1918, while GNP only moved about

0.6-for-one with commodity output in the postwar era. Since the analysis of
Section III suggests that this assumption is not accurate, neither are the
estimates of the degree of stabilization that can be derived from the Kuznets
series.

-41-

CONCLUSION

The comparisons of Section IV show that perceptions of the prewar business
cycle are very different when the new GNP series is used in place of Kuznets's

prewar estimates. Using the new GNP series business cycle fluctuations from
1869-1918 appear to be much less severe than is conventionally thought. As a
result, one of the most often cited generalizations about business cycles, the
dramatic damping of economic fluctuations, disappears when the new estimates of

prewar GNP are considered. In its place is the much more modest stylized fact
that the severity of business cycles has declined only slightly over time.
Given that the new prewar data presented in this paper offer such different
conclusions about the prewar economy, it is important to evaluate the quality of
the new series and to stress its limitations. In presenting the derivation of
the new series in Section III, I stress the assumptions being made to derive the

new estimates. The key assumption is that prewar GNP moves significantly less
than one-for-one with commodity output. This assumption is justified on the
basis of the estimated relationship between GNP and commodity output over the

period 1909-1928 and 1955-1983. Even when one allows the measured sensitivity
of GNP to commodity output to decline over time, one's best estimate is that
cyclical movements in prewar GNP are only about 60-70 percent as large as those

in commodity output. As a result, it seems likely that the key assumption
underlying the new estimates is correct.

-42-

In addition to the evidence concerning the validity of my assumptions, a
further piece of evidence about the cyclical accuracy of the new estimates of
GNP is provided by my research on the historical industrial production and

unemployment data (see Romer, 1986a, 1986b). In these studies, a variety of
historical evidence is used to show that the assumptions underlying the industrial production and unemployment data are incorrect and that the true data

should be substantially less volatile. If one believes that various output and
employment series should show roughly similar cyclical movements, then the fact
that the existing Kuznets series is more volatile than the new estimates of
unemployment or industrial production provides evidence that the Kuznets series

is excessively volatile. By the same reasoning, the fact that my new estimates
of GNP show cyclical movements of approximately the magnitude the previous
studies suggest is accurate for industrial production and unemployment provides
evidence that the new GNP series is reasonably reliable.
While the analysis above stresses the accuracy of my new estimates of GNP
for cyclical analysis, it is important to realize that the new series is still

subject to many limitations. The most important of these is the fact that the
new estimates of GNP are still derived entirely from data on commodity output.
Since the necessary data on most noncommodity components of GNP do not exist,

this limitation is essentially inevitable. However, this fact means that any
movements in GNP not perfectly correlated with commodity output will be missed
by the new GNP series as they are by the existing Kuznets series.
Another limitation of the new estimates is that no adjustments have been

made to the trend level of GNP. The new estimates have also not been derived to
be completely consistent in trend values with the Kendrick or Department of

Commerce estimates. Therefore, my new estimates of GNP should not be used for
analyzing long-run trends or in any application where actual levels are

- '+3 -

important.

The new estimates have been derived to represent cyclical movements

more accurately than do existing estimates of GNP. It is thus in cyclical
analyses that the new estimates of real gross national product will be both most
accurate and most useful.

1Various measures of cyclical volatility are very similar for the
Kuznets and Kendrick series. The standard deviation of percentage changes
for the original Kuznets components series for 1889-1918 is 0.064. The
same measure for the Kuznets/Kendrjck series for 1889-1918 is 0.059. The
standard deviation of deviations from trend for the Kuznets series for
1889-1918 is 0.052, while that for the Kuznets/Kendrick series is 0.047.
Hence, the Kuznets components series is the main determinant of the cyclical movements in the Kuznets/Kendrjck estimates of GNP.

2The standard deviation of percentage changes for the Kuznets
components series for 1869-1918 is 0.063 while that for the Kuznets/Gallman
series is 0.058. The standard deviation of deviations from trend for the
Kuznets series for 1869-1918 is 0.055, while that for the Kuznets/Gallman
series is 0.054.
3The Shaw/Kuznets series on commodity output in 1929 prices for
1869-1938 is published in Capital in the American Economy, Table R-21, pp.
553-554.
4Kuznets also derives three statistical variants of his components
estimates of GNP. The only difference between the three variants is how
the trend level of the flow of services to consumers is measured. Variant
III derives the trend level of services by interpolating the trend from the
Commerce Department series after 1929. Since this series is considered to
be the variant most consistent in levels with the postwar GNP series, this
variant of the Kuznets components series is used in the all of the following analysis.
5To estimate the sensitivity of the real flow of services to
consumers to the real flow of commodities to consumers, Kuznets regresses
the deviations from trend of the two series on one another. Trends are
calculated by connecting overlapping decadal averages. Kuznets's results
for 1919—1941 are:
SERt -

R2= .20

where SER is the level of the real flow of services to consumers, CF is the
level of the real flow of commodities to consumers, and bars over variables
denote trend values. (See Kuznets, 1961, notes to Table R-28, p. 571, for
details.) The same regression for the period 1952-1976 yields estimates:

SERt -SER

t

-.154(CF -CF)+e

(.139)

R2 = .05
where data on SER and CF are from the National Income and Product Accounts and
are measured in 1972 dollars.
6An example may help to clarify Kuznets's procedure. Kuznets calculates
averages for decades that overlap by five years, say, for 1899-1908, 1904-1913,
and 1908-1917. He then uses these decadal averages to represent the midpoint of
the decade. In this example the midpoints would be 1903.5, 1908.5, and 1913.5.
He then interpolates linearly between these values to form an annual trend
series.

7Trend values of GNP and commodity output are calculated in the same way
Kuznets calculates trends: by connecting midpoints of overlapping decadal
averages.

8Kuznets's income-side estimates of GNP for 1909-1918 are described in
detail in Capital in the American Economy, (1961, pp. 546-552).
9The gross value series is described in the Federal Reserve Board
publications Industrial Production for 1971 and 1977. I amend both the
gross-value and value-added indexes of final goods production to include the
output of construction materials. I do this because Shaw's measure of commodity
output includes construction materials production.
10The detrended Shaw series on real commodity output declined by 49.3
percent between 1929 and 1932. The decline in commodity output in the worst
depression in the period 1869-1918, 1880-1885, was 17 percent. The Shaw series
is detrended using a piecewise linear trend.

The evidence from Kuznets and Barger suggests that the trend is almost
certainly milder in the period 1869-1918 than in the postwar era. As a result,
this procedure will overstate the sensitivity of GNP to commodity output in the
prewar era.

2The FRB gross value series actually begins in 1954. But, since 1955 was
chosen as a benchmark year, it is better to use the data beginning in 1955.
13To calculate trend values for years not between two benchmarks, the trend
from the nearest two benchmarks is continued either forward or backward.
14The two exceptions to this pattern are 1918 which corresponds to a mild
trough in production and 1937 which corresponds to a mild boom. 1918 is included because it seemed likely that the apparent decline in production is due to
the unusually high level of wartime production in 1916 and 1917. As a result,

-46-

1918 appears to be a year when output may have been essentially on trend. 1937
is included because it appears to only be a boom in relation to the severe
depression of the early 1930s. Given the relatively low level of output in 1937
it seems plausible that production in that year only reflects trend output
rather than potential output.
15i have tested the effects of the choice of benchmark years on the
estimated sensitivity of GNP to commodity output over the interwar period. In
addition to constructjng trend values using the years 1910, 1918, 1924, and 1937
as benchmark values, I construct alternative trend values
using the years 1911,
1925, and 1936 as benchmark values. The alternative trend values are different
from the original trend values in that GNP and commodity output are now substantially below trend during World War I and very much above trend in the late
1920s. Despite these changes in trend values, the estimated sensitivity of GNP
to commodity output for the period 1909-1928 does not change substantially. The
coefficient estimate using the original trend values is 0.649. The estimate
using the alternative trend values is 0.733.
16The actual data that I use are presented in Friedman and Schwartz
(1982,
Table 4.8, pp. 122-129). Friedman and Schwartz compile a series on GNP that is
essentially identical to Kuznets's components series except that it includes
Gailman's unpublished adjustment of trend levels for certain components of GNP
for the period before 1909. Friedman and Schwartz actually only present data on
net national product. To form a series on real GNP I add Kuznets's unpublished
data on capital consumption for 1869-1918.
171n estimating equation (2) the simple linear trend jumps at 1955 to take
account of the missing observations. For reference, the trend series is equal
to one in 1909.

8Baily uses the Kendrick estimates of GNP reported in Historical
Statistics. DeLong and Summers use Gordon's quarterly data set, which, depend-.
ing on the version used, derives its annual movements from either the
Kendrick/Commerce Department series or the Kuznets/Gallman series presented in
Friedman and Schwartz (See Gordon, 1982).
19The commodity output series is used to determine peaks and troughs
because it is the one series that is nearly uniformly good over the prewar and
postwar eras. In nearly all cases the cycles in GNP correspond perfectly with
those in commodity output.

20The actual dates of prewar business cycles using my method of dating are,
peak to trough, 1869-1871, 1873-1875, 1880-1885, 1887-1888, 1892—1894,
1895-1896, 1901-1902, 1903-1904, 1906-1908, and 1913-1914. The dates for
postwar business cycles are 1947-1949, 1953-1954, 1956-1958, 1959-1961,
1966—1967, 1968—1971, 1973—1975, and 1979—1982.

2Some of the similarities between the components and the regression series
may be due to inconsistencies between the two series. The components series
includes Galiman's corrections to the trend of GNP, the regression series does
not. One of Galiman's main corrections is to raise the 1869 level of GNP
substantially. As a result, percentage changes and deviations from trend may
appear quite large in the early 1870s in the uncorrected regression series.
However, even when the early 1870s are excluded the Kuznets regression series
has volatility properties very similar to those of the components series.
