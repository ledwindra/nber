1. Introduction

One of the lessons from the Asian Currency Crises is the danger of the de

facto dollar peg adopted by the Asian economies that had extensive trade and
1

investment relationship with countries other than the United States. When the

yen appreciated vis-à-vis the US dollar, the Asian economies enjoyed the boom,

or a bubble in some cases, due to increased exports. But, when the yen

depreciated, the Asian economies tended to experience a recession, or a burst

bubble. The experience of the Asian boom and bust in the 1990s, along with the

yen-dollar exchange rate fluctuation, is a stark reminder of risk of the fixed

exchange rate regime.

An obvious solution for this problem is to increase flexibility of the

exchange rate. If the baht had appreciated during the yen appreciation phase

of the 1993-95, the extent of overheating in Thailand might have been limited;

and if the baht had depreciated along with the yen in 1996-97, then the decline

in exports could have been mitigated. This kind of exchange rate flexibility

can be achieved by a flexible exchange rate regime which keeps the real effective

exchange rate relatively stable.

An obvious insight here is that an emerging market economy, which exports

3

to the United States and Japan, is well advised to consider managed exchange

rate regimes, in order to avoid excessive volatility of the real effective

exchange rate.

2

The questions to be considered include how to determine a

reference rate as an appropriate real effective exchange rate and how much

fluctuation is excessive.

The optimality of the exchange rate regime is defined as the one that

minimizes the fluctuation of the trade balances, when the yen-dollar exchange

rate fluctuates. Ito, Ogawa, and Sasaki (1998) proposed how to calculate the

optimal weights when the emerging market economy exports to Japan and the United

States only. The optimal weights were calibrated with some assumptions on the

demand elasticities and export shares. In this paper, we extend the Ito, Ogawa,

and Sasaki model to include a neighboring emerging market as well as Japan and

the United States. A typical Asian economy exports about one-third to the United

States and one-third to Japan, and the rest to countries in the Asian region

(and EU). Therefore, to simplify, we consider the case that country A (B,

respectively) exports to the U.S., Japan, and country B (A, respectively).

Therefore, the real effective exchange rate calculation includes the currency

of neighboring country. What makes difficult and interesting in this model is

4

that the optimal weights may depend on what the neighboring country is adopting

as weights. In the extreme case, if country A is adopting the dollar peg, country

B should adopt the dollar peg; and if country B is adopting the dollar peg,

then country A should adopt the dollar peg. Namely, the dollar peg is a Nash

equilibrium. However, if country A is using a currency basket which mirrors

the export shares, adjusted for demand elasticities, then country B should adopt

a (similar) currency basket; and if country B is using a currency basket, then

country A should adopt a currency basket. This trade-weighted currency basket

is also a Nash equilibrium.

Although the paper is motivated by the recent Asian experiences, the

application is not limited to Asia. Results obtained in this paper are relevant

to any developing countries with a trading structure with export destinations

including different currency areas.

Which of the Nash equilibria is chosen depends on the inertia as well as

rational calculation. If countries can coordinate, then they should choose the

best among Nash equilibria. This process of choosing the optimal Nash

equilibrium can be regarded as a regional currency arrangement. Coordination

failure could occur if a country has some obstacles for coordination from

5

political or social obstacles against breaking inertia. What this paper shows

is that coordinate managed float by the two countries would increase the

stability in the trade balance fluctuations.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 explains the model.

We assume that the Marshall-Lerner condition, which means that depreciation

of the local currency will increase the net trade surpluses, is satisfied

throughout the paper. Section 3 examines what the Marshall-Lerner condition

implies in our oligopoly model with imported parts and It also examines in what

situation the Marshall-Lerner condition is satisfied in the model. Section 4

defines and solves for an optimal currency regime. We introduce the exchange

rate policy of the monetary authorities of the two countries in order to analyze

interdependence and coordination failure between their exchange rate policies.

2. Model

(1) Settings

Our earlier work, Ito, Ogawa, and Sasaki (1998), considered the question

of choosing optimal weights in the basket currency system for a country that

exports goods to the United States and Japan.

6

An Asian country was modeled

as a one-sector economy where a representative firm assembles parts imported

from

Japan

and

the

United

States

into

manufactured

products.

3

The

representative firm in one Asian country was assumed to compete with Japanese

firms and/or U.S. firms in the Japanese and U.S. markets. We extend our earlier

model to include another neighbor country in the model in order to analyze

interactions of the exchange rate policies among Asian countries.

We assume that a representative firm in country A imports parts from the

United States and Japan and exports its products to markets in the United States,
4

Japan, and country B as well as a domestic market. Also, a representative firm

in country B imports parts from the United States and Japan and supplies its

products to markets in the United States, Japan, and country A as well as a

domestic market. We assume that prices of parts from the United States and Japan

are given in terms of their production country’s currency.

5

Asian countries export their goods and services mainly to Japan, the United

States, and neighboring Asian countries. For example, Thailand exports

one-fourth to Japan, one-fifth to NIES (Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Taiwan)

and ASEAN-4 countries (Thailand, Philippines, Indonesia, and Malaysia),

one-seventh to the United States. These three categories account for more than

7

60 percent. Similarly, Malaysia exports to 22 percent, 34 percent and 17 percent

to Japan, to the United States, and to Asian countries, respectively. The sum

of these three categories reaches 72 percent. The structure is similar in

Indonesia and the Philippines. Table 1 shows the export shares by destination

to Japan, the United States, Asian countries, and four European countries

(Germany, France, UK, and Italy). Therefore, the assumptions of the model,

Country A exports to Japan, the United States, and neighboring country B, are

realistic.

Each market in countries A and B is supposed to be a duopoly market where

both country A and B firms compete with each other. Markets in the United States

and Japan are under monopolistic competition. Country A and B firms compete

with many domestic firms in each of the U.S. and Japanese markets. They supplies

their products in the U.S. and Japanese monopolistically competitive markets

given average prices of their domestic products made in the United States and

Japan. We assume that prices of the products made in the U.S. and Japan are

kept unchanged (exogenous to this model) for simplicity. Moreover, we assume

that all firms in countries A and B have identical cost functions. Each firm

maximizes its profits in terms of its own home currency.

For simplicity, we assume that price elasticities of demand for the country

A and B firms’ product are equal to each other in each of the country A and
B markets. That is, ε = ε = ε

and ε = ε = ε . Thus, price elasiticities of

the markups of country A and B firms’ products are equal to each other in each
of the country A and B markets. That is, η = η = η

and η = η = η .

From equation (2.9), we obtain equilibrium prices for the country A and B

firms’ products in the duopoly market of countries A and B, respectively:

Equations (2.11) and (2.12) shows that the equilibrium prices of country

A and B firms’ products depend on not only marginal total costs of country A

and B products but also the exchange rate of currency A vis-à-vis currency B.

(2) Relative prices and demand functions

From equations (2.7) and (2.8), we obtain equilibrium relative prices of

country A and B firms’ products relative to the Japanese and the U.S. domestic

products in the Japanese and U.S. markets, respectively.

Moreover, from equations (2.11) and (2.12), we obtain equilibrium relative

country A and B markets, respectively.

Equation (2.15) shows that the equilibrium relative prices depend on the

We specify demand functions for country A and B firms’ products exporting

to the Japanese, the U.S., countries A and B markets from equations (2.13) to

(2.15):

(2.19)

for  and . The equations show that the demands depend on some exchange
rates as well as the marginal total costs, the Japanese and U.S. prices.

3. Effects of exchange rates on trade balances

In the next section, we introduce the exchange rate policy of the monetary

authorities of the two countries into our model under the Marshall-Lerner

condition to analyze interdependence and coordination failure between their

exchange rate policies. In this section, we examine what the Marshall-Lerner

condition implies in the model where domestic firms import parts from Japan

13

and the United States and in what situation the Marshall-Lerner condition is

satisfied in the model.

At first, we analyze effects of changes in the exchange rates on trade

balances of countries A and B. In the model, trade balances are equal to a total

exports (to Japan and US) less the sum of total costs of imported parts (from

Japan and US) and imports from the neighbor country. Therefore, the trade

balances denominated in the dollar for countries A and B, respectively, are

shown as:

7 = (   3 I  + (   3 J  + (   (   3 K − (   3 ω  4 − (   3ω  4 − 3  K 
(3.1)
for  and .
We derive a relationship between changes in the trade balances and those

in the exchange rates from equations (3.1).

14

and , [Ö represents a rate of changes in variable [ . It is assumed, as
mentioned earlier, that prices of the products made in Japan and the United

States are kept unchanged.

The first line of equation (3.2) represents a direct price effect of exchange

rates on trade balances. The second line of (3.2) represents an indirect effect

of exchange rates via PTM (pricing to market) behaviors of country A and B firms.

The third line of (3.2) represents an indirect effect of exchange rates on trade

balances via trade volumes. It is necessary for the Marshall-Lerner condition

that the volume effect (third line of equation (3.2)) dominates the sum of direct

price effect (first line of equation (3.2)) and PTM effect (second line of

equation (3.2)). We consider whether the Marshall-Lerner condition is always

satisfied in our model if the volume effect dominates the sum of direct price

effect and PTM effect. For the simplicity sake, we examine whether depreciation

of the local currency have positive effect on the net trade volumes, that is,

export volumes minus import volumes.

The indirect effect via trade volume (third line of (3.2)) can be described

as a function of the changes in the exchange rates as follows:

are positive, if the export industries are putting

value added to the parts imports, converting parts into products for exports.
Hence, we assume that these τ parameters are positive.
The exchange rates have effects on the product prices, which change the

relative prices of the products in the Japanese, the U.S., and country A and

B markets. The changes in the relative prices have effects on the demand for

the products in these markets. Demand for products made in country A (or B)

is equivalent to export volumes of the country in our model. Since parts are

imported from Japan and the United States, and some products are imported from

the neighbor country, the exchange rates have effects on imports as well as

exports.

In equation (3.3), it is clear that the exchange rates of the neighbor

16

country’s currency vis-à-vis the yen and the dollar have unambiguous effects

on trade volumes. The appreciation of the neighbor currency has positive effects

on the trade volume, as the competitiveness of home products would increase.

However, the exchange rates of the home currency vis-à-vis the yen and the dollar

a priori have ambiguous effect on the trade volumes.


The exchange rate of the home currency vis-à-vis the yen, that is $

is

positive — depreciation will cause export volume to increase— i f the following

inequality is satisfied:


τ  ε  ϕ   − α  + (τ  ε ϕ  + τ  ε ϕ )α  > τ  ε
ϕ
α 

(3.4)

Similarly, the exchange rate of the home currency vis-à-vis the dollar, that


is $

is positive, if the following inequality is satisfied:


τ  ε
ϕ
 − α   + (τ  ε ϕ  + τ  ε ϕ  )  + α    > τ  ε  ϕ  α 

(3.5)

The right hand side of inequalities (3.4) and (3.5) means that the exchange

rates have negative effects on export volumes into the US or Japanese market

through increases in cost of imported parts in terms of the home currency. The

left hand side means positive effects that depreciation of the home currency

increase export volume through relative prices and decrease import volume of

parts.

17

Thus, the effects of the exchange rates on the trade balances are ambiguous

because parts are imported in our model. Depreciation of the home currency

against a foreign currency increases price of imported part in terms of the

home currency. The increase in domestic price of imported parts decreases

optimal outputs and, in turn, decreases export volumes as well as decrease

import volume of parts. The depreciation of home currency has an adverse effect

on the trade balance if the negative effect on exports via imported part costs

is larger than the positive effects that depreciation of the home currency

increase export volume through relative prices and decrease import volume of

parts. In this case, the Marshall-Lerner condition is not satisfied even if

the volume effect (third line of equation (3.2)) dominates the sum of direct

price effect (first line of equation (3.2)) and PTM effects (second line of

equation (3.2)).

Thus, the dominance of the volume effect is necessary but is not sufficient

for the Marshall-Lerner condition to hold in our oligopoly model where domestic

firms import parts from Japan and the United States. In addition, it has to

be supposed that the direct effect of the exchange rates on export volume is

larger than the effect via imported part costs on export volume for the

18

Marshall-Lerner condition to hold. Hence, the Marshall-Lerner condition is

satisfied in the model when the latter condition as well as the dominance of

the volume effect is satisfied.

Next, let us examine the effects of yen’s and dollar’s appreciation

vis-à-vis both home and neighbor’s currency on the home trade volume, which

is related with stability of exchange rate policy of the two countries analyzed


in the next section. These effects are the sum of $

and $

 

and that of

$  and $   , respectively. The following equation shows the condition that the
yen appreciation (vis-à-vis the both emerging market currencies) produces the

positive trade volume effects:

(3.7)

Now, we examine several cases about the import status:

(1) The country i imports parts from both Japan and U.S.

19

Then, inequalities (3.4) and (3.5) may be or may not be satisfied. Also,

inequalities (3.6) and (3.7) may be or may not be satisfied.
(2) The country i imports parts from Japan only. ( ω  = ), α   =


Then, (3.5) is satisfied, but (3.4) may be or may not be satisfied. Moreover,

if the production function is symmetric among the neighbor countries — that is,

the third term in the left hand side of (3.6) and the right hand side of (3.6)

cancel out—then inequality (3.6) is also satisfied.
(3) The country i imports parts from US only. ( ω  =


), α  =

.

Then (3.4) is satisfied, but (3.5) may be or may not be satisfied. Moreover,

if the production function is symmetric among the neighbor countries — that is,

the third term in the left hand side of (3.7) and the right hand side of (3.7)

cancel out—then inequality (3.7) is satisfied.

4. Exchange rate policies

In this section, we develop the above two-country model to analyze how

exchange rate policy of the monetary authorities in one country can be affected

by that in the neighbor country. Interactions of the exchange rate policies

conducted emerge in the two country model, because the competitiveness of home

20

goods depend on the exchange rate vis-à-vis the neighbor’s. At first, we suppose

that the monetary authorities of the two countries have the same objective to

stabilize fluctuations in trade balances. The policy reaction function of

country i is derived in terms of the currency basket in order to stabilize

fluctuations in trade balances, given the exchange rate policy of the neighbor

country. As a result, it is theoretically possible that a coordination failure
6

may occur.

The coordination failure is a situation where both of the monetary

authorities adopt the dollar peg at the same time and a situation where the

monetary authorities of one country adopt an optimal currency basket peg while

the monetary authorities of the other country adopt the dollar peg.

(1) Optimal currency baskets

We express the above effects of exchange rates on the trade balances of

countries A and B in terms of rates of changes as follows:

Equations (4.1) and (4.2) corresponds to equation (3.2) for country A and B.

However, by the assumption of the Marshall-Lerner condition, effects of

21

equation (3.3) dominate in equation (3.2). Therefore, for the qualitative

analysis, we may regard signs of A and B coefficients in equations (4.1) and
(4.2) as the $

(3.3). The sign conditions derived for equation (3.3) are relevant below.

A currency basket is defined as weighted averages of exchange rates of a

home currency vis-à-vis the dollar and the yen. Thus, a currency basket peg

means that a currency basket of nominal exchange rates is fixed at a level.
7

In other words, rates of changes in a currency basket, which is a weighted

average of rates-of-changes in the exchange rates, is equal to zero:

where Z ( for  = , ): a weight on the dollar in a currency basket for country

23

≤ Z ≤  .8

. We suppose a realistic case where

When the monetary authorities peg the home currency to a currency basket,

relationships between the exchange rates of the home currency vis-à-vis the

dollar or the yen and those of the yen vis-à-vis the dollar are shown as follows:

(4.5)

(4.6)

If the monetary authorities adopt a dollar peg system and a weight on the dollar

in a currency basket is equal to unity, the exchange rate of the home currency

vis-à-vis the dollar is fixed at a level while the exchange rate of the home

currency vis-à-vis the yen co-moves with that of the yen vis-à-vis the dollar.

The home currency appreciates against the yen when the dollar appreciates

against the dollar.

Both of the monetary authorities are assumed to choose weights on the dollar

and the yen in a currency basket in order to stabilize the fluctuation of their

own trade balances that is caused by changes in the exchange rates.

9

Our

optimality of the exchange rate policy is to stabilize fluctuations in trade

balances in terms of the dollar under a currency basket peg system. We assume

24

that the monetary authorities minimize the squared rate of change in trade

balances in terms of the dollar. That is, the monetary authorities have the

following policy objective functions to minimize:

Equation (4.11) is a policy reaction function for the monetary authorities

of country A, which means that the monetary authorities of country A choose
an optimal weight for minimizing their objective function given a weight Z

25

chosen by the monetary authorities of country B. Also, equation (4.12) is a

policy reaction function for the monetary authorities of country B. They choose

an optimal weight for minimizing their policy objective function given a weight

Z

chosen by the monetary authorities of country A. Thus, both of the monetary

authorities have to determine their optimal weights in a currency basket while

they are affected by behavior of the other monetary authorities.

There is a unique equilibrium pair of optimal weights for countries A and

B because both of the policy reaction functions are linear functions. From

equations (4.11) and (4.12), we derive a pair of optimal weights on the dollar

in a currency basket to stabilize their trade balances for both of the countries

A and B at the same time:

and the case

If both of the monetary authorities of countries A and B could, at the same

of the countries. However, it is not always guaranteed that the optimal weights

In this case, a pair of the weights proceeds along a converging process

toward an equilibrium point implied by the optimal weights ( Z , Z ). The weights
for both of the countries should converge to their optimal equilibrium ones.

Figure 1 shows a case where inequality (4.15) is satisfied. An equilibrium




point with the optimal weights ( Z , Z ) is a stable one on a plain where policy
reaction functions of countries A and B are depicted as lines AA and BB,

respectively. In this case, each of the monetary authorities of countries A

and B gradually changes its own weight on the dollar in a currency basket in

order to stabilize its own trade balances, given the weight chosen by the other

monetary authorities. As the result, the weights for both the countries can




eventually reach to an equilibrium point with the optimal weights ( Z , Z ).

. In this case, weights diverge out of the optimal weights once




they are off the equilibrium point ( Z , Z ).
Figure 2 illustrates policy reaction functions of both the countries in a

case where inequality (4.16) is satisfied. In this case, an equilibrium point




with the optimal weights ( Z , Z ) is unstable. Suppose that each of the monetary
authorities of countries A and B chooses its own weight in order to stabilize

its own trade balances, given the weights chosen by the other monetary

authorities. The weights chosen by the monetary authorities should diverge out




of the optimal weights ( Z , Z ). Thus, the weights on the US dollar increase
and reach to a unity for both the countries, provided that the weight is

realistically constrained between 0 and 1. Both of the monetary authorities

eventually adopt a full dollar peg system rather than the optimal currency

basket peg system although they have been choosing their weights in order to

stabilize their own trade balances.

28

Thus, if inequality (4.16) is satisfied, an optimal weight point is unstable.

Then, it is difficult for the monetary authorities to change their exchange

rate policy to an optimal exchange rate policy.

(2) Coordination failure in optimal currency baskets

Next, we analyze whether the monetary authorities of countries A and B can

directly shift their exchange rate system from the current de facto dollar peg

system to an optimal currency basket peg system. The shift to optimal currency

basket peg system depends on whether each of the monetary authorities can

decrease fluctuations in trade balances under the optimal currency basket peg

system in comparison with those under the dollar peg system. Especially, each

of the monetary authorities should care about fluctuations in trade balances

in a case where it shifts to the optimal currency basket peg system while the

other monetary authorities keep the dollar peg system.
If both of the monetary authorities adopt the dollar peg ( Z = Z =  ) at the
same time, fluctuations in trade balances are calculated as follows:

Suppose that A and B coefficients in equations (4.1) and (4.2) are equal

it is clear that the fluctuations in trade balances in the case of the dollar

peg are larger than those in the case where both of the monetary authorities

adopt the optimal currency basket as shown in equation (4.13) and (4.14) except

Thus, the monetary authorities of the two countries should adopt the optimal

currency basket peg system rather than the dollar peg system unless equations

(4.21) and (4.22) are satisfied in a symmetric two country model.

30

Next, we consider a possibility that the monetary authorities adopt the

dollar peg system in a situation where equations (4.21) and (4.22) are not

satisfied in a symmetric two country model. One possible reason is that the

monetary authorities of one county cannot adopt an optimal exchange rate policy

because their loss increases if the monetary authorities of the country alone

adopt the basket while the other country keeps pegging its home currency to

the dollar.

We consider how the monetary authorities of one country should behave, given

that the monetary authorities of the other country adopt the dollar peg. For

example, suppose that the monetary authorities of country A adopt the above
optimal currency basket peg ( Z = Z ) while the monetary authorities of country


B adopt the dollar peg ( Z =  ). Fluctuations in trade balances for country A
are obtained in this case as follows:

monetary authorities of country B adopt the dollar peg ( Z =  ), the monetary
authorities of country A compare fluctuations in trade balances between the

two options. The monetary authorities of country A compare equation (4.23) with

equation (4.17). They prefer the dollar peg to the optimal currency basket peg

because fluctuations in trade balance in the case of adopting the dollar peg

The fluctuations in trade balances in this case are larger than those in the

We can explain how each of the monetary authorities adopts exchange rate

policy in Figure 3. Point D represents a situation where both of the monetary

32

authorities adopt the dollar peg system. Point F represents a situation where

the monetary authorities of country A adopt an optimal currency basket peg

system while the monetary authorities of country B adopt keep the dollar peg

system. If fluctuations in trade balances at point F are larger than those at

point D, the monetary authorities of country A should not change its own weight
on the dollar from Z =  to Z = Z .


Thus, both of the monetary authorities should keep pegging their home

currencies to the dollar if their trade balances fluctuate more widely in the

case of the optimal currency basket peg than in the case of the dollar peg.

At this time, they face in a coordination failure that they are forced to adopt

the dollar peg even though the optimal currency basket peg is to minimize the

fluctuations in trade balances if they adopt the optimal currency basket peg

at the same time. Only if both of the monetary authorities coordinated to adopt

the optimal currency basket peg at the same time, they peg their home currencies

to the optimal currency basket.

6. Conclusion

We examined the question of choosing the exchange rate regime for emerging

33

market economies that export goods to the United States, Japan, and neighbor

countries. The optimal exchange rate regime is defined as the one that minimizes

the fluctuation of the trade balance, as the yen-dollar exchange rate fluctuates.

One might object to this framework, since the Asian currency crises were largely

caused by capital movements, and not by the trade account problem. There are

two reasons why the trade account stabilization is important. First, one of

the important triggers that caused sudden reversal of capital (or an attack

by speculators) in Thailand was the large current account deficit (about 8

percent of GDP in 1996), partly caused by the overvalued baht. The trade balance

is important since it affects the confidence of the exchange rate regime. Second,

when capital movements are large, that would drive the currency overvalued

and/or the current account into deficits. In order to judge whether the exchange

rate is misaligned or not, one needs the “ benchmark. ” The exchange rate that

is calculated to stabilize the real exchange rate gives such a benchmark.

Therefore, having calculated such a basket value, it gives a good reference

to answer a question whether capital flows are too much or too little to cause

misalignment.

We can draw some policy implications from these conclusions. First, if the

34

Asian region that relies on exports to Japan, the U.S., and other regions, wants

to avoid a boom and bust cycle due to under- and over-valued exchange rates,

the real effective exchange rate must be managed. In particular, the basket

currency regime is helpful. Second, the choice of the exchange rate regime (or

weights in the basket) may depend on your neighboring country’s choice of the

regime. There may be coordination failure. Given the dollar peg of the

neighboring country, the choice is the dollar peg, and the neighboring country

decides the choice in the same manner. However, both countries would be better

off to move to a basket currency regime with more weights on the yen, if the

decisions are made simultaneously. Third, in order to help the calculation of

such a basket tailored to each country, it may be helpful to calculate and

publish the typical currency basket unit for the region. Such a currency unit

(say, Asian Currency Unit, or ACU) has weights on the U.S. dollar, the yen,

and the euro. Each Asian country manages its own currency within the reasonable

band around the ACU, then the coordination failure may be avoided. Calculation

of such a currency unit and simulations of the trade balances under the basket

system is left for future work.

Although this paper simplifies many aspects of the real world, the essential

35

points, we believe, are very relevant to the real world. Asian countries will

benefit from coordination with each other in choosing the exchange rate regime.

Notes:

1

Several Asian countries including Thailand and Korea before the currency
crisis claimed that they were adopting a basket system, or a managed float system.
However, the actual movements of the exchange rates suggest that the weight
of the dollar was quite high. See Frankel and Wei (1994). In that sense, we
call the pre-crisis regime as the de facto dollar peg.
2

The so-called “ two-corner solution ” has become a popular view among some
researchers and policy makers in the post-crisis discussions. (See Eichengreen
(1999), for example.) According to this view, free floating, an ultimate
flexibility, and a currency board, ultimate inflexibility, are only stable
regime in the long run. Any intermediate regime — managed float or fixed exchange
rate regime without adopting the currency board — is unstable. Advocates of the
two corner solution cite the fact that Hong Kong and Argentina, both currency
board economies, survived the currency crisis of the neighboring economies.
It is not advisable for countries that export substantial volumes to Japan
as well as the United States to adopt the exchange rate regime pegged to the
U.S. dollar. Hong Kong seems to be an exception, as it is a small open country
with lots of reexports and with high labor and price flexibility of domestic
markets. The currency board of the Hong Kong type is not suitable for other
Asian economies.
Would the free floating exchange rate a recommended exchange rate regime
to other Asian economies? If one believes that the market will (most of the
time) determine the exchange rate at the level (almost) consistent with
fundamentals, then the free floating is advisable. However, if one believes
that the market will (too often) drive the exchange rate to the level (clearly)
misaligned with the fundamentals, then policy actions to the domestic market
and some direct interventions to the exchange rate market may be called for.
The latter view is more convincing in the view of the following evidence. First,
even advanced countries find it necessary to intervene occasionally. Foreign
exchange rates sometimes become misaligned with fundamentals. The U.S. dollar
in 1984-85 and the yen in 1995 are the obvious example of overvaluation.
Misalignment needs to be corrected by intervention and some policy adjustment.
Second, the worst of the Asian crises, say November 1997 to January 1998, came
long after the Asian economies moved to flexible exchange rate regime. When
contagious crises feed each other among the regional economies, free floating
regimes would cause a downward spiral of the region’s currencies. Thus, a
devaluation of a currency would bring down the currencies of trade- and
investment-related countries. Those who praise China to be a barrier to stop
a contagious devaluation spiral in the region by maintaining the fixed exchange
rate should also be advocating some sort of managed float in times of crisis.

Flanders and Helpman (1979), Lipschitz and Sundararajan (1980), and Flanders
and Tishler (1981) emphasized only the real side of the economy in modeling
the currency basket peg issue. On the other hand, Turnovsky (1982) and Bhandari
(1985) used a general equilibrium macroeconomic model which included capital
mobility.
4

Ohno (1989) examined pass-through effects of exchange rates on export pricing
behavior in manufacturing after taking account of prices of raw materials.
Marston (1990) modeled a similar pricing to market model.
5

In our model, Japanese and US suppliers of parts are not assumed to price to
markets because many suppliers exist and they behave competitively. Parts are
more difficult to differentiate compared to brand-name products.
6

Bénassy-Quéré (1999) and Ohno (1999) analyzed pegging the US dollar as a

43

coordination failure.
7

A currency basket of nominal exchange rates is fixed at a level because we
suppose that economies experience no inflation. The monetary authorities should
adopt a crawling currency basket system if the economies experience positive
rates of inflation that are different from those in the United States and Japan.
8
We limit a realistic case though it is theoretically possible to suppose  < Z .
9
The assumption was made in Ito, Ogawa, Sasaki (1998). Alternatively, we may
assume that the monetary authorities minimize absolute variations of the trade
account to GDP ratio. Bénassy-Quéré (1999) assumed that the monetary
authorities are to stabilize both their external competitiveness and the real
price
of their external debt.
10
We can obtain the linear reaction functions because we assume quadratic
functions of rate of change in trade balances. It is usual to consider
fluctuations of trade balances as a second order of moment though it is, in
general, unnecessary to limit a second order of moment. We can obtain non-linear
functions if we assume more general form of objective functions.
