ABSTRACT
Existing research on electoral sentencing cycles shows that elected judges levy longer sentences
when they are up for re-election. Using newly collected sentencing data including a number of
states not previously studied, we find that elected judges in several states do not appear to change
their sentencing when they are up for re-election. This heterogeneity in the presence of electoral
sentencing cycles appears to be best explained by cross-state variation in the competitiveness of
judicial elections. Incumbent judges do levy harsher sentences when they are in a competitive reelection campaign, but in states where competition for judgeships is low this does not come to the
forefront.

This heterogeneity in the presence of electoral sentencing cycles appears to be best
explained by cross-state variation in the competitiveness of judicial elections. Incumbent judges do levy harsher sentences when they are in a competitive re-election campaign, but in states where competition for judgeships is low this does not come to the

Introduction

The practice of electing judges is a distinctly American phenomenon (Shugerman, 2012). One
argument in its favor is that it promotes policy congruence between judge and voter preferences,
holding judges accountable to the public. A counter-argument is that policy congruence may not
be desirable for its own sake since judicial decisions are meant to be based solely on the facts
and the law (Kessler and Piehl, 1998). Furthermore, there is a concern that judicial elections may
create inconsistent—and therefore unfair— sentencing behavior if judges give more weight to
voter preferences or special interest groups closer to elections. This concern was evident when the
Supreme Court ruled (in Williams-Yulee vs. Florida Bar, 575 U.S.) that states could prohibit judges
from soliciting funds for their election campaign. Chief Justice Roberts wrote in the majority
opinion of that ruling that “judges are not politicians, even when they come to the bench by way
of the ballot. A state may assure its people that judges will apply the law without fear or favour,
and without having personally asked anyone for money.”1
The potential pitfalls of electing judges have motivated a body of empirical research that studies whether judges pass more punitive sentences when they are up for re-election. This hypothesis
emerges from signaling models where voters have preferences for longer sentences than judges,
especially for severe crimes like murder or rape. There are a number of studies that find evidence of precisely such electoral sentencing cycles, specifically in Pennsylvania (Huber and Gordon, 2004), Washington (Berdejó and Yuchtman, 2013), North Carolina (Boston and Silveira, 2019;
Abrams, Galbiati, Henry, and Philippe, 2019a), and Kansas (Gordon and Huber, 2007; Park, 2017).2
Each of the aforementioned studies focuses on a single state in great detail. In contrast, we take a
different approach by combining sentencing data that we collected from 10 different states (Pennsylvania, Washington, North Carolina, plus Alabama, Colorado, Georgia, Kentucky, Minnesota,
Tennessee, and Virginia) and analyzing electoral cycles in all states through a series of “one-sizefits-all” estimations.3 We confirm the presence of electoral sentencing cycles in exactly those states
1

As early as 1835, de Tocqueville had predicted that judicial elections “will sooner or later lead to disastrous results,
and that some day it will become clear that to reduce the independence of magistrates in this way is to attack not only
the judicial power but the democratic republic itself” (p310, ch8).
2
Most research focuses on state trial courts because they handle by far the largest number of cases, including
criminal cases, in the U.S. They can sentence defendants to long prison sentences and in some states to death.
3
Trial court data are managed by each state’s sentencing commission individually. We requested court sentencing
data from all U.S. states. What determined the final sample of ten was (i) whether a state had digitized their sentencing
data, and (ii) whether these data included judge identifiers in their data. The willingness to share the data was a third

considered in the existing literature (i.e., Pennsylvania, Washington, and North Carolina). Strikingly, however, we find very little evidence for electoral sentencing cycles in any of the other states
in our data: The data in Alabama, Colorado, and Tennessee are inconclusive and we can reject neither the absence of a cycle nor a cycle of similar magnitude to that in Pennsylvania. In Georgia,
Minnesota and Kentucky, the estimates are precise enough to conclude that electoral sentencing
cycles are absent. In Virginia, which forms a quasi-placebo as the one state in our data with purely
appointed judges, (re-appointment-)sentencing cycle are actually negative, though insignificant.
This broad classification into states with no evidence, mixed evidence, or strong evidence for sentencing cycles is robust to an array of different specifications, including different approaches to
inference, variations in how to control for sentencing guidelines, and recidivism, and to adding
acquittals to the data. Other patterns found in previous research, e.g., gender and race biases, and
a strong effect of recidivism show up consistently across all states in the data.
While most states show at least weak evidence for a cycle for minority defendants, there is
also heterogeneity in this dimension, as we find qualitatively more pronounced sentencing cycle
for whites in some states.4 While the difference between the sentencing cycles for whites and
minorities is never itself statistically significant, North Carolina’s sentencing cycle becomes a lot
more precisely estimated when we consider only whites, and Pennsylvania’s cycle becomes a lot
more precisely estimated and economically large when we consider only minorities.
The novel fact of heterogeneity in the presence of electoral sentencing cycles across U.S. states
is important in part because sentencing cycles have so far often been viewed and discussed as
being pervasive across the U.S., in part because of the existing research on the topic.5
It is natural to ask what explains the heterogeneity in the presence of electoral sentencing cycles. We consider two broad explanations. First, heterogeneity in electoral sentencing cycles might
be explained by variation in formal rules governing judge elections: judges can be chosen through
non-partisan elections (with potentially many challengers), partisan elections, retention elections
constraint in the case of Kansas, which is not in our study because its data processing fee was an order of magnitude
larger than the next-most expensive state.
4
In previous work, Park (2017) finds a more pronounced sentencing cycle for minorities in Kansas, while Abrams
et al. (2019a) find the opposite in North Carolina, i.e., a more pronounced sentencing cycle for whites.
5
For example, two articles in The Economist strongly argue this case: “The trouble with electing judges” (Aug 23rd
2014), and “New research confirms old suspicions about judicial sentencing” (April 27th 2019). Electoral sentencing
cycles were also the subject of a February 23rd 2015 episode of John Oliver’s popular TV show Last Week Tonight.

(where incumbents face only a confirmation vote and no challenger),6 or—in the case of Virginia—
by appointment and re-appointment. It is likely the electoral pressures are decreasing in the stated
order of electoral rules.7 Second, heterogeneity in electoral sentencing cycles might be explained
by the observed level of competitiveness of judicial elections, insofar as this is unexplained by the
formal electoral rules. We measure competitiveness in two ways, either as the average number of
donors who contributed to a judge’s electoral campaign (Bonica, 2016), or as the share of judicial
elections in which incumbents face at least one challenger.
In univariate regressions, we find that more open entry rules, more donor activity, and more
observed challengers all correlate with stronger estimated sentencing cycles. To gauge the relative
importance of these factors, we interact individual judges’ electoral sentencing cycles with the
(state-level) measures above in a multivariate regression that pools cases across all states. We find
that the strongest correlate of the presence of sentencing cycles appears to be the two measures
of the observed competitiveness of judicial elections, even when conditioning on formal electoral
rules. We discuss avenues for future research to explore the root cause of cross-state differences in
the competitiveness of judicial elections.
Our paper’s focus is on the heterogeneity and pervasiveness of electoral sentencing cycles
across U.S. states. It contributes to a literature on judge behavior and court sentencing (Posner,
2008; Epstein, Landes, and Posner, 2013; Cohen and Yang, 2019), and specifically builds on and
expands the aforementioned work on electoral sentencing cycles.8

Data

Section 2.1 discusses the sentencing data that was obtained separately from ten states. Section 2.2
discusses cross-state differences in the rules governing judicial elections, and in their observed
competitiveness. Section 2.3 discusses how we the measure judicial electoral cycles (and, by extension, electoral sentencing cycles).
6

Gordon and Huber (2007) find within Kansas that sentencing cycles show up in districts with partisan elections,
and not in districts with retention elections. (Kansas is unusual in having within-state variation in these rules.)
7
This is least obvious for partisan vs non-partisan elections, but Lim and Snyder (2015) provide evidence that
partisan elections are less competitive.
8
A related line of research focuses on judge quality. Lim (2013) shows that elections may even reduce the quality of
judges if re-election pressures deter highly qualified judges from entering.

2.1

Sentencing Data

We contacted the majority of U.S. states’ sentencing commissions with requests for access to their
trial court data (alternatively referred to as circuit courts or lower courts in some states). In the
end, 18 states had digitized their trial court sentencing data, and had processes in place for sharing
these data. Of these, 10 states included judge identifiers in their sentencing data (a requirement for
estimating electoral cycles). Online Appendix A.1 reports on the institutions in charge of the data
in each state, the relevant contacts, and details the process of requesting the data. In total, these
10 states provided us with data on over three million sentencing decisions. Tennessee’s data had
the longest time coverage (1980–2017), Colorado the shortest (2010–2016). See Table 1. We consistently observe defendants’ race and gender, except in Virginia, where the data does not include
any defendant characteristics. Among the full sample of crimes, 18% of defendants are women
and 30% are black. For the sample of severe crimes 11% of defendants are women and 38% are
black. We also observe other non-white race groups (Asians, Native Americans, and Hispanics),9
but neither previous research nor our own estimations display a consistent relation between these
and sentence lengths (relative to the omitted white category). Recidivism is the defendant characteristic that has the most variability in how it is reported. Some states report counts of previous
convictions, some report dummies for having been previously convicted, some report information on the severity of previously committed crimes, and four states do not report recidivism at
all. Fortunately, different transformations of the recidivism measure have little bearing on our
core results.
Empirical studies of judicial electoral cycles emphasize that electoral cycles should be expected
primarily for more severe crimes because these are more visible to voters who may follow them
in the media. These are also the cases where voters seem to prefer more severe punishments on
average (relative to sentencing guidelines). Huber and Gordon (2004) therefore censor their study
of Pennsylvania sentencing to court cases of “aggravated assault, rape, and robbery convictions.”
Similarly, Berdejó and Yuchtman (2013) restrict their study of Washington to severe crimes “as
defined by the FBI ... assault, murder, rape, and robbery.” We follow this approach and only
consider criminal cases involving assaults, murders, rapes, and robberies. Panel B of Table 1
shows the number of severe crimes in each state, as well as their share of the total number of

The only exception is Alabama, which reports only Black, White, and Other.

cases. The average sentence length is confirmed to be significantly larger for severe crimes.

2.2

Cross-State Differences between Judicial Elections

Variation in Rules:

There is considerable cross-state variation in the rules that govern judicial

elections. The states in our data represent all possible sets of rules that exist. Nationwide, there
are 9 states with partisan judge elections, 22 have non-partisan ones, 3 have partisan elections for
entrants and retention elections for incumbents, 10 have appointments for entrants and retention
elections for incumbents, and 11 have appointments only.10 In our data, reported in Table 2, Washington, Georgia, Kentucky, and Minnesota have non-partisan elections. Alabama and Tennessee
have partisan elections, where a judge has a party affiliation and may face a challenger from his
or her own part in a primary. Pennsylvania has a unique mix whereby new judges initially face
partisan elections, but thereafter sit for a ten-year term at the end of which they stand for retention
elections, i.e., they face only a yes/no vote and no challenger. Colorado and Virginia both appoint
10

The numbers sum up to over 50 because 4 states have within-state variation in these rules. See Lim, Snyder, and Strömberg (2015, Table.1) and Park (2017) for excellent discussions of cross-state variation in judicial electoral/appointment rules.

new judges. In Colorado, these initially appointed judges later face retention election, whereas in
Virginia they are re-appointed on fixed cycles.11
Table 2 also displays considerable variation in judicial electoral cycle lengths: Two states have
four-year cycles, three have six-year cycles, four have eight-year cycles. Newly appointed judges
in Pennsylvania need to run for partisan re-elections at the next electoral cycle (i.e., within two
years), upon which they serve for ten-year cycles that culminate in retention elections.12 The
combination of retention elections and unusually long election cycles would suggest it is ex ante
less likely to find electoral sentencing cycles in Pennsylvania, a fact already noted by Huber and
Gordon (2004, 250-251).
Competitiveness of Judicial Elections: The actual measured level of competitiveness of judicial
elections is quite variable across states. The best measure of this is the average number of donors
who contributed to a judge’s electoral campaign, taken from Bonica (2016). As a secondary measure, we use ballotpedia.org to construct the share of judicial elections that faced any challenger in each state from 2012–2016 (when this data was consistently available). Both variables
are reported at the bottom of Table 2. The two measures of judicial competitiveness have a surprisingly similar distribution: the average number of donors per race is 26, and the average share
of contested races is 28%.13 The two measures also display considerable cross-state variation in
the average degree of electoral competition that judges face: In Washington and North Carolina,
the average number of donors per race was 30 and 34 respectively, while in Kentucky this number was 6. These data do not cover Colorado or Tennessee. For Virginia, we set the number to
zero. Similarly, in Washington and North Carolina, 32% and 38% of elections respectively were
contested, while in Minnesota this share was 10%.14 In Virginia, we set this value to zero since
judges are almost always re-appointed, and there are no election donors.
The last four rows of the table show how dispersed judicial elections are over time within each
state. The main point of asking this question is to clarify how much residual variation in electoral
11

Vidal and Leaver (2011) suggest that even appointed judges are not perfectly insulated from the electorate.
In some states, newly appointed judges then have to run for electoral confirmation at the next election cycle (i.e.,
within two years). In other states, the electoral cycles is tied to the seat, and when a newly appointed judge needs to
run for their first election depends on when in their cycle their predecessor retired.
13
We treat the level of judicial competition as a time-invariant state-specific feature because information about challenges is very incomplete outside the 2012–2016 window.
14
In Pennsylvania, we took a weighted average of the 28% of No votes in retention elections, and the much higher
share of contested partisan elections for newly appointed judges.

cycles there can be in the data once one conditions on time-controls. Because available data vary
by state, we normalize all years as follows: judge elections that happen in the year of a presidential
election (2000, 2004, 2008, etc) are dated as t = 1, elections the year after (2001, 2005, 2009, etc) are
dated as t = 2, and so on for t = 3 and t = 4. The data show that the share of judges that is up
for re-election is almost uniformly spread over time in most states, indicating that the identifying
variation for the estimation of sentencing cycles in a state comes from all data, and not only from,
say, the year of a presidential election.

Notes: This table reports on judicial electoral institutions in each state. Washington, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania
are set off visually as the states whose data was used in previous research on electoral cycles. As well, it reports on
the number of individual judges in each state whom we could merge to our judicial biography database. The rules of
selection and re-election are well-know and have been reported in other sources. The ‘most common entry method,’
discussed in Section 2.3 under ‘Judge Entry’ is to our knowledge a novel fact, and we have not seen it discussed
anywhere else in the literature.

2.3

Measuring Electoral Sentencing Cycles

We follow Berdejó and Yuchtman (2013) and Huber and Gordon (2004) in defining judge j’s judicial election cycles as a linear running variable ‘proximity to election’ (PtEjt ) that is scaled from 0
to 1
PtEj(s)t = t/Ts ,

(1)

starts at 0 on the day after a general election, and increases by 1/Ts each day until it equals 1 on
the day of the next general election. Ts is the length of state s’s electoral cycle, i.e., TW A = 4 × 365
in Washington, and TN C = 8 × 365 in North Carolina.

Judge Entry and Establishing Re-Election Dates:

In general, judicial elections are held on the

general election cycle, i.e., in early November of every even-numbered year.15 However, judicial
elections are staggered in the same way as the elections of U.S. senators so that only a portion of
judges is up for re-election in any given election year. The sentencing data contains no information
on which judges are up for re-election in which election-year. Unfortunately, it is also not possible
to infer electoral cycles from a judge’s entry or exit in the sentencing data. This is because it
turns out that judges mostly exit the profession at times that do not coincide with the electoral
cycles.16 The flipside of this fact is that, with seats needing to be filled, judges also mostly enter
the profession outside of the regular electoral cycle, via gubernatorial appointment. Washington
is the only state in our data where we found the majority of judges entered through elections. This
is noted as the ‘most common entry method’ in Table 2. These facts mean that observed entry and
exit in the sentencing data are not sufficient information for establishing in which year a judge is
running for re-election. In order to construct judges’ electoral cycles, we therefore had to code up
individual judge biographies (entry/appointment dates, re-election dates, and retirement dates)
from www.ballotpedia.org. See details in Online Appendix A.2.
There is considerable variation in when a judge

Filing Dates, Primaries, and General Elections:
is actually under electoral pressure:

• First, there is an official filing date by which incumbents and challengers need to file their
intent to (re-)run for the judgeship. Up to the filing date, all judges are under the threat
of an electoral challenger. In the very frequent cases where no challenger files, all electoral
competition on the incumbent effectively ends on the filing date.
• States with partisan elections have a primary between the filing date and the general election date. A common pattern in the data is to have a competitive primary election (say,
between two Democratic Party candidates) that is followed by an uncontested general election, because all candidates are from the same party. In such cases, electoral pressure peaks
between the filing date and the primary date and then goes to zero between the primary and
15
Pennsylvania is the only state in the country to hold judicial elections solely in odd-numbered years. In Georgia
elections happen in even years but the month varies and the election can take place as early as in May.
16
Most exiting judges retire, relatively few die, and some move to their states’ higher courts, or move to federal
courts. The retiring judges may thereafter enter private practice, or continue as part-time ‘senior judges’.

Notes: (a) This figure shows two example judge bios and electoral cycles in our data. All data on electoral cycles is
collected from ballotpedia.org. In Minnesota (top panel), judges are elected for six-year cycles. In Washington
(bottom panel), judges are elected for four-year cycles. (b) Proximity on the vertical axis is defined on a 0, 1 scale as in
expression (1), where proximity equals 1 on the day of the general elections in early November. We trim the electoral
cycles at the state-wide filing date, after which the electoral cycle effectively ends for the large majority of judges who
have no challenger for their seat. The time between filing date and general election date is sandwiched between two
vertical lines. The electoral cycle restarts with the general election date. An observation is a day in which a judge passed

the general election. However, in partisan-election states, one can also have the opposite: no
challenger in the primary but a challenger in the general election.
• Even states with non-partisan elections have a primary election if there is more than two candidates for a seat. In those cases, the general election is a run-off between the two candidates
with the highest vote share in the primary. Electoral competition can peak in the primary
(for example, if the challenger who comes third in the primary subsequently endorses the
incumbent, making the general election less competitive), or it can peak in the general (for
example, if the challenger who comes third in the primary subsequently endorses the remaining challenger).
In summary, the evolution of electoral pressure on an incumbent can be highly non-monotonic
after the filing date, depending on the above scenarios. In Washington, Berdejó and Yuchtman
(2013) collected information on which races had a challenger and show that the sentencing cycle
drops off after the filing date when there is no challenger. Unfortunately, in our broader sample
information on challengers is very difficult to obtain in most cases; and attempting to collect it
would result in a fragmentary and likely un-representative sample, with the availability of the
information likely endogenous to the election. We therefore omit cases after the filing date in our
baseline specification. This means PtEjt usually peaks somewhere around 0.9 for judge j, before
re-starting at 0 the day after the election date. Figure 1 illustrates this for two randomly drawn
judges, one in Washington, one in Minnesota.17 Figure 2 shows how close the filing date is to the
general election date in each state. As a robustness check, we will also include cases after the filing
date in some specifications.

Results

This section presents the core findings of our paper. Our approach is to go through a variety of
specifications that test for the presence of electoral sentencing cycles, and to apply each specifica17

There is a concern with this approach that judges may postpone contentious or visible cases until after the filing
date. We check for this in Online Appendix B, but find no evidence of bunching of severe cases after the filing date.

tion separately to the ten states in the data. Our baseline estimation framework is

SentenceLengthit = β · PtEjt + βX · Xi + µj + µt + µc + ijt ,

(2)

where i identifies the court case, Xi are case characteristics, and PtEjt is the ‘proximity to election’
defined in expression (1) for judge j. PtEjt is our core regressor of interest, and it is evaluated
relative to judge fixed effects µj that control for unobserved judge heterogeneity. For time controls µt we include year fixed effects and we also follow Berdejó and Yuchtman (2013) and others
in including quarter-of-year fixed effects to avoid spurious effects from other political cycles that
coincide with election cycles. We also include county fixed effects µc to control for local characteristics; these are often co-linear with judge fixed effects, but not always because some judges switch
district over the course of their tenure.18
Table 3 reports the results of estimating equation (2) separately for each state across the ten
columns. The first five states have non-partisan elections, the next two states have partisan elections, Pennsylvania has a combination of initial partisan elections and later retention elections,
Colorado has initial appointments and later retention elections, and in Virginia judges are appointed and re-appointed by the state legislature. Each panel of Table 3 reports on results of one
specification. Panel A is our baseline specification, which focuses on severe crimes, includes as
controls the defendant’s race, gender, age, recidivism, and crime severity, and which two-way
clusters standard errors by calendar-year (to account for trends in sentencing) and quarter-of-year
(to account for cyclical patterns that could correlate with sentencing cycles). In Panel A, we cluster
by year as well as by quarter to match the quarter-of-year fixed effects. Panel B is different only
in using heteroscedasticity-robust standard errors, as in Huber and Gordon’s study of Pennsylvania. (In Online Appendix Table 1, we alternatively cluster by calendar-quarter, replacing 4 + t
fixed effects with 4 × t fixed effects (for t years), and find similar results.) Taking these differences approaches to inference together, we confirm the existence of electoral sentencing cycles
that previous research had found in the three states in our data that were covered by previous
research: Washington, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania. Judges in these three states appear to
issue sentences that are respectively 4.3, 3, and 15.2 months longer when a judge approaches their

In North Carolina, judges are required to rotate across districts, a fact that is exploited in a very nice identification
strategy in Abrams, Galbiati, Henry, and Philippe (2019b).

Notes: (a) Each panel reports on results of a one specification, run for each state separately across columns. (b) All
regressions include defendant’s race, gender, age, age squared, and an indicator for recidivism. All regressions also
include the case’s severity, and the number of charges in each case. Finally, all regressions include judge fixed effects
and year as well as three quarter-of-year fixed effects. (c) Panel B differs from A only in the treatment of standard
errors. Panel C re-estimates Panel A for all crimes. (d) Standard errors are two-way clustered by calendar-year and
quarter-of-year in all panels except B. We compute heteroscedasticity-robust standard errors in Panel B. *** p<0.01, **
p<0.05, * p<0.1

Panel C includes data on all crimes, not just severe crimes, and as expected this also generally
weakens the existing evidence for sentencing cycles. Interestingly, Abrams et al.’s study of North
Carolina is the only one we know of that uses all crimes in its base sample, and North Carolina is
the only state where sentencing cycles are noticeable even when all crimes are considered.20
Strikingly, none of the other six states with judicial elections in our data display anything near
statistically significant sentencing cycles in panels A and B, although the coefficient on PtEjt is
positive in all of them. Interestingly, this coefficient is negative in Virginia, which is the only state
in our data where judges are appointed, and can therefore serve as somewhat of a counter-factual
benchmark for the absence of electoral cycles.
In summary, the core observation in Table 3 is that the presence of electoral cycles in criminal
sentencing is less uniform than as previously thought. To make this statement more precise, we
19
In Online Appendix Table 2, we report on specifications when electoral cycles are not normalized from 0 to 1
but instead start at 0 the day after an election and increases by 1 each day. this shrinks the Pennsylvania estimate
(where cycles are particularly long) closer to the Washington estimate, but also shrinks the North Carolina estimate
(where cycles are also particularly long) further away from the Washington one. The point of this exercise is to scale
coefficients and standard errors down by Ts ; statistical precision is naturally unaffected.

need to distinguish between states where sentencing cycles appear to be genuinely absent and
states where the data are too noisy to be confident either way.
To do this, we employ a seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) framework to test whether
electoral cycles in states with significant estimates are statistically different from those in states
with insignificant coefficients. Table 4 contains the p-values from the state-by-state comparison of
the coefficients using SUR. (We ranked the three states with statistically significant electoral cycles
according to the size of the coefficient.) Pennsylvania’s estimate does not statistically differ from
those of Washington and North Carolina. Pennsylvania’s cycle is statistically larger than cycles in
Georgia, Minnesota, and Virginia. The difference is also close to significant for Kentucky, but not
for Alabama, Tennessee, or Colorado. This suggests that the cross-state heterogeneity observed
in Table 3 is a mixed bag: (i) the absence of an electoral cycles is clearest in the “quasi-placebo”
state of Virginia (where judges are not elected and we estimate a re-appointment cycle); (ii) some
states (Georgia and Minnesota) have an estimated coefficient for electoral cycles near zero, and
their sentencing data are precise enough that we can reject them having an electoral cycle; (iii)
some states (Kentucky, Colorado) also have an estimated coefficient for electoral cycles near zero,
but their sentencing data are so noisy that we cannot reject them having an electoral cycle; (iv)
yet other states (Alabama, Tennessee) have an estimated coefficient for electoral cycles near the
one in Washington and North Carolina but their sentencing data is so noisy that we cannot reject
them having no electoral sentencing cycle; finally, (v) some states (Washington, North Carolina,
Pennsylvania, and Kansas if we consider evidence from other studies) show clear evidence of
electoral sentencing cycles.
Data Quality: In Online Appendix Table 3, we scrutinize the robustness of this pattern to data issues. One main data-quality concern is measuring recidivism, which is unavailable in some states’
data, as reported in Table 1. It is encouraging that except for Alabama, the states without recidivism information do not stand out as having a lower R-squared. This is because a crime’s measured
severity in most states’ coding already factors in recidivism. Alabama’s low R-squared is explained
by the (in our data, unique) combination of no recidivism information and a severity coding that
does not factor in recidivism. In Panel A, we transform the recidivism categories into a single
dummy to check whether a coarser measurement of recidivism matters. Encouragingly, it doesn’t.

Notes: (a) This matrix contains p-values of the state-by-state comparison of the coefficient β̂. (b) We report p-values in
square brackets, based on robust standard errors (Panel B of Table 3). *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1

In Panel B, we drop the recidivism control altogether. Thought there is some variation in how
much the R-squared is affected by this, our coefficient of interest is, encouragingly, never affected
much.21 In Panel C, we additionally control for sentencing guidelines, which we only observe
in Washington, Alabama, Minnesota, and Pennsylvania. Controlling for sentencing guidelines
makes sentencing cycles more pronounced in states where we find them (i.e., Washington and
Pennsylvania) and moves the coefficient closer to zero for states where we don’t find them in the
baseline specification (i.e., Alabama and Minnesota). In short, this does not change the overall
pattern. In Online Appendix Table 5, we use a pooled-data estimation (replacing competitivenesss
in equation (4) with measures of data quality) to show that differences in sentencing cycles are
not driven by the state-specific differences in data quality, along the dimensions of recidivism,
whether states allow concurrent sentences, and the quality of the measures of crime severity.
Time-District Varying Confounders: In Online Appendix Table 6, we scrutinize the robustness of
this pattern to confounding factors that time-vary in different ways across districts. One potential
example of this could be that prosecutors run for re-election at different times in different districts
in a state. We address this by adding wither county-quarter fixed effects or and county-year fixed
effects. The main results are robust to these specifications, and in fact strengthen.
Acquittals: One might worry about acquittals (zero-sentences). These are omitted from the anal21

To provide one more piece of evidence on the comparability of the data quality, we also report the coefficients on
defendant characteristics (race, gender, and recidivism) in Online Appendix Table 4, and these also turn out to all have
the expected signs and comparable magnitudes across states.

14

ysis because in our sample of severe crimes sentencing guidelines should prevent judge from
acquitting unless the defendant was innocent, or there was insufficient evidence or procedural errors. As a robustness check, Panel A in Table 5 adds acquittals, and confirms that this marginally
weakens results (as expected) while not affecting the overall pattern in the data. Another way of
looking at the acquittal issue is that there should be no effect of sentencing cycles on the probability of being acquitted, since this should be determined by innocence or insufficient proof. Panel B
replaces the outcome with an indicator for being convicted and confirms this is indeed the case.

Time-Path of Sentencing Cycles: The results thus far document pronounced heterogeneity in the
presence of sentencing cycles across states. Another potentially interesting form of heterogeneity
is the time path that the sentencing cycles takes over the electoral cycle (in the states where it
exists). To investigate this, we re-estimate regression (2), but replace the linear regressor PtEjt
with a schedule of quarterly fixed effects over the full electoral cycle. The estimated quarterly
fixed effects are reported in Figure 2.22 Figure 2 suggests that in Washington and Pennsylvania the
effect of proximity to the next election really increases in particular in the last two quarters of the
cycle. In contrast, the effect appears linear over the full cycle in North Carolina (and Minnesota,
to the extent that it can be considered as having a sentencing cycle in Table 3).
22
For visual clarity of the time-path of the cycle, we omit confidence bands from Figure 2. These are depicted in

Notes: This figure depicts estimates from a regression that replaces PtEjt with a full set of quarterly fixed effects, with
the first quarter omitted (visually normalized to zero). The number of estimated quarter fixed effects varies with the
length of a state’s cycle. The dashed vertical line towards the end of a cycle marks the filing date. In Washington for
example, this is about 5 month or 1.67 quarters before the general election.

16

In order to estimate the full set of quarterly fixed effects for Figure 2, we include all data,
including cases after the filing date. The filing date is depicted as a dashed vertical line near
the end of the electoral cycle in Figure 2. Cases after the filing date are omitted on principle in
Table 3 because we are unable to measure electoral pressure on judges in this time-window (see
the discussion at the end of Section 2.3). However, because Figure 2 suggests that the sentencing
cycle in Washington is most pronounced after the filing date, we also re-estimate the baseline
estimation with these cases included. Panel A of Online Appendix Table 7 shows indeed that the
baseline effect gets stronger in Washington when we include data after the filing date. Results in
other states are qualitatively unaffected.23
There may also be a concern that judges could, instead of levying harsher sentences in the
lead-up to the filing date, postpone contentious or visible cases until after the filing date to avoid
a challenger running against them on the basis of a contentious ruling. If this was the case we
would expect some bunching of cases after the filing date, and we would expect this to be concentrated in the severe cases. In fact, what we find is the opposite: Online Appendix Figure 2
shows no evidence of bunching either side of the filing date for severe-crime cases, but there is
some evidence for bunching of non-severe cases before the filing date. For completeness, Panel B
of Online Appendix Table 7 also reports on a specification where we replace the linear regressor
from expression (1) with a count of quarters.24
Racial Biases in Electoral Sentencing Cycles: Another interesting and important potential form
of heterogeneity in sentencing cycles pertains to race. Race-biased sentencing cycles have previously been investigated in the literature, with Park (2017) finding a more pronounced sentencing
cycle for minorities in Kansas, and Abrams et al. (2019a) finding the opposite in North Carolina,
i.e., a more pronounced sentencing cycle for whites. To isolate a race-based sentencing cycle, we
estimate the following specification

SentenceLengthit = β · PtEjt + βM · PtEjt · Minorityi + βX · Xi + µj · Minorityi + µt + µc + ijt . (3)
23

One may have expected the effect to also get stronger in Pennsylvania, but it is important to recall that in Pennsylvania the filing date only applies to judges running for their first election. See Table 2.
24
For example, Washington’s electoral cycle is 4 years, i.e., 16 quarters, so that the coefficient in Panel B is roughly
1/16 the baseline coefficient (0.27 ≈ 4.32/16).

17

Aside from adding the interaction between PtEjt and the race of the defendant, the noteworthy
extension in specification (3) is that we estimate two separate sets of judge fixed effects that are
specific to defendant’s race. This is important because it allows judges’ baseline sentencing attitudes to vary by the defendant’s race, so that (3) mirrors a split-sample estimation strategy in
which the core estimation (2) would be run separately for minorities and non-minorities, but at
the same time imposes a common set of coefficients on other controls unrelated to race.25
Panel A of Table 6 reports the results of estimating specification (3). Panel B replaces β · PtEjt
with βN M · PtEjt · Non-Minorityi . Thus, while Panel A tests if there is a statistically significant difference in whites’ and minorities’ sentencing cycles, Panel B instead tests for each cycle separately
if it is significantly different from zero. The difference between the sentencing cycles for whites
and minorities is never itself statistically significant in Panel A. However, North Carolina’s sentencing cycle is more precisely estimated when we consider only whites (in both panels, relative
to Table 3); and Pennsylvania’s sentencing cycle in Panel B is more precisely precisely estimated
and economically large when we consider only minorities.
In summary, Figure 2 and Table 6 show that our core finding (sentencing cycles are heterogeneous) extends beyond heterogeneity in their mere presence. Even within the states that display
significant evidence for sentencing cycles, these vary in their time-paths and in which population
of defendants they most apply to.
25

We code Black, Hispanic, and Native Americans as minority, and Whites and Asians as non-minority. Results are
similar when Asian defendants are re-classified as a minority.

Potential Explanations for the Presence of Sentencing Cycles

The core findings of our paper are that electoral sentencing cycles are heterogeneous across U.S.
states; and that they do not appear to be pervasive overall. These findings naturally raise the question of what explains the observed heterogeneity. Our quantitative answer to this question relies
on cross-state variation, and is therefore necessarily coarse. The evidence we provide is suggestive rather than causal, and its purpose is to highlight avenues for future research. Guided by the
relevant literature that points to electoral competition as being at the heart of any political cycles
(Besley and Burgess, 2002; Besley, 2006; Brender and Drazen, 2008), we ask to what extent heterogeneity in the presence of sentencing cycles is explained by heterogeneity in the competitiveness
of judicial elections. We capture this idea in the following equation

SentenceLengthit = β · PtEjt + βC · PtEjt × competitivenesss
+βXs · Xi + µj + µts + µc + ijt ,

19

(4)

where βC estimates whether sentencing cycles are a function of the competitiveness of judicial
elections;26 µts are state-specific year fixed effects, βXs are state-specific coefficients on defendant
controls, and judge and district fixed effects (which are always state-specific).
We consider four determinants of competitivenesss : first, variation in electoral rules (i.e. retention, partisan, non-partisan elections) likely determines the competitiveness of elections. Second,
variation in the length of electoral cycles might also determine election competitiveness because
longer cycles generate a stronger incumbency advantage. Third, donor activity will be a key determinant of a race’s competitiveness. Fourth, differences in the baseline (state-wide) probability of
having a challenger will determine the electoral pressures incumbents face. Empirically, electoral
rules variation can be operationalized through indicator variables, and we can directly measure
electoral cycle length, the level of donor activity, and the races in which incumbents face a challenger. All of these measures are reported and discussed in Section 2.2. The first two measures
naturally vary only across states, while the third and fourth measure (donor and challenger activity) do vary by race within a state. However, we have data on these latter two only for a limited
number of years (and therefore a limited share of judicial elections). Furthermore, measuring
them at the level of the election would bias us towards finding them to be more important than
state-level variation in rules (by reducing measurement error); without getting us closer to causal
identification. For these reasons, we chose to aggregate these measures up to also treat them as
cross-state sources of variation.
We begin by reporting simple visual correlations between each measure and the baseline estimate of the sentencing cycle in each state in Figure 3. For this illustrative purpose only, we rankorder electoral rules in order of their inherent competitiveness as follows: appointment (Virginia),
retention election (Colorado), initial election and later retention election (Pennsylvania), partisan election (Alabama and Tennessee), non-partisan election (Washington, Georgia, Kentucky,
Minnesota, and North Carolina).27 This ‘electoral rank’ measure correlates positively with the
sentencing cycle estimate, as expected. The top-right panel shows weak evidence that election26
Of the four measures of competitivenesss that we consider, the first two are state-rules which naturally cannot
vary by judge. The third and fourth measures are state-aggregates of individual races. In principle, the third and
fourth measure are measurable separately for each judge. However, at the judge-level, these measures are likely to be
endogenous to characteristics of the race. Because of this, and to maintain a consistent granularity between the four
measures, we consider only state averages for the third and fourth measure.
27
We recognize that both the ordinality and the cardinality of this ranking can be contested.

Notes: (a) Each panel considers one of the four determinants of competitivenesss (see Table 2), and plots them against the
point estimates of the sentencing cycle reported in Panel A of Table 3.

cycle length may correlate positively with sentencing cycles, possibly because longer cycles imply
judgeships are more secure and thus more valuable. The bottom-left shows that measures of donor
activity correlates positively and strongly with the sentencing cycle estimate, indicating that differences in electoral competition may explain the differences in sentencing cycles The bottom-right
suggests the same when donor activity is replaced with the probability of being challenged in the
race.
The correlations in Figure 3 only use the point estimate from Table 3, but they are also consistent with the evidence on the precision of the estimates in Table 4, where the evidence for an
absence of sentencing cycles is strongest in Georgia and Minnesota, the two states where incumbent judges are the least likely to be challenged according to the bottom-right of Figure 3.
The correlations in Figure 3 are of course only suggestive. To better gauge the relative importance of these factors (without making causal claims) we estimate specification (4). The first
Column in Table 7 reports on a simple pooled version of the sentencing cycle specification (which
corresponds to specification (4) without the term βC · PtEjt × competitivenesss ). In the pooled sample, the estimated sentencing cycle has a p-value of exactly 10 percent. In short, in the aggregate

21

the evidence for the presence of sentencing cycles is right on the cusp of conventional statistical
significance. In Columns II–III of Table 7, we test whether primary and non-primary elections
are associated with stronger sentencing cycles than retention elections or appointments. Partisan
elections do appear to give rise to stronger electoral cycles, while non-partisan elections have a
smaller and less precise coefficient. Online Appendix Table 8 re-estimates the results without Virginia to provide a comparison only within states with elected judges. The results continue to show
a strong effect for partisan elections, and no significant effect for non-partisan elections. Next, Column IV shows that longer cycles are in fact associated with stronger cycles, which mechanically
reflects the fact that North Carolina and Pennsylvania both have long electoral cycles.

The two determinants for competitivenesss considered in Columns II–IV are rules-based or institutional measures. In contrast, challenger activity and donor activity might be thought of less as
determinants for, but rather as direct measures of competitivenesss . We introduce these in Columns
V–VI. Both interactions are highly significant. The average number of donors per race is 26, and
the average share of contested races is 28%. At these averages, sentencing cycles are positive:
−3.639 + 0.279 × 26 = 3.62; and −4.740 + 0.303 × 28 = 3.74. In Columns VII–X, we “horse-race”
these observed measures of the competitiveness against each of the two rules-based measures,
Columns XII–XIII for the partisan-election indicators, and Columns IX–X for cycle length. In both
cases, the interactions with challenger activity and donor activity remain highly significant; in
22

fact, they tend to be statistically more significant than the institutional determinants.28
In summary, electoral rules appear to play some role in explaining the heterogeneity in the
presence of sentencing cycles, but the stronger correlate with the presence of sentencing cycles is
residual variation in the competitiveness of judicial elections (i.e. challenger and donor activity)
that is unexplained by formal electoral rules.

Conclusion

The core contribution of our paper is to empirically document two novel facts. The first is that
there is much more heterogeneity in the presence of electoral sentencing cycles across U.S. states
than was previously known. While sentencing cycles are clearly present in several states including
Washington, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, they are clearly absent in Georgia, Minnesota,
and Kentucky, and the evidence for their presence is extremely weak in Alabama, Colorado and
Tennessee.
The second fact is that sentencing cycles appear to be a function of the observed competitiveness of judicial elections. States where incumbents are least likely to be challenged also display the
least evidence for sentencing cycles. While this finding is only a partial correlations, and should
be interpreted as suggestive rather than causal, it nonetheless raise the question what gives rise to
the residual variation in the competitiveness of judicial elections that we see.
Based on informal interviews we conducted with judges and legal scholars it appears that the
answer might lie with cross-state differences in norms within the judicial profession. In one state,
a judge told us that incumbents are almost never challenged because judicial electoral competition is “frowned upon” and judgeships are viewed as something to be bestowed by gubernatorial
appointment as a hallmark of one’s professional standing. In another state, a judge told us of
unfettered competition for judgeships and a complete lack of checks and constraints on electoral
competition. Demonstrating the existence of such differences in professional norms in a quantitative and statistically well-identified way, and ultimately understanding their origins, appears to
us a fruitful avenue for future research.
28

The number of observations is reduced for the Bonica (2016) measure because it is unavailable for Colorado and
Tennessee. Online Appendix Table 9 shows that the other results look similar when we exclude Colorado and Tennessee
everywhere.

Data Description

Sentencing Data

Sentencing data was collected separately from each state. 15 states were willing to share their
data with us for free or at reasonable cost: Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland,
Minnesota, Mississippi, Nevada, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and Washington.
We contacted each state with the following initial data request:
The data we are looking for has a court case (or ’sentencing event’) as the unit of observation. In
some states the data is organized by charge (with several charges making up the case or sentencing
event) and that is equally fine. The key data that we need are:
1. date, month and year of sentencing,
2. type of crime,
3. length of sentencing,
4. type of sentencing (low-security, high security, etc),
5. defendant’s sex,
6. defendant’s race,
7. court identifier
8. name of judge or judge identifier number,
9. type of court that convicted (trial, appeal, etc),
10. in what prison the person was sent
We do not seek any information that identifies defendants.

Judicial Biography Data

All data about judge electoral cycles was taken from the ballotpedia.org. The site contain
information about the judges of each circuit court for each state.30 The individual page of each
judge contain data for age and gender of a judge, the dates when she was appointed/elected, date
of retirement (if already retired), name of a governor by whom she was appointed (if appointed),
and whom the judge replaced.
To collect the data research assistants started with the contemporary judges, collected their
data and proceeded with their predecessor judges. This procedure resulted in collecting information for approximately 80% of the judges mentioned in the sentencing data. For the states where
the name of a judge was known we searched those judges individually on the sites of their courts
and added them to the dataset.
Ten of the states in this paper include judge names or identifiers in the sentencing data: Alabama, Colorado, Georgia, Kentucky, Minnesota, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, and Washington. We then code up judge biographies, including when they are up for reelection from Where judges are identified by name, merging the judge biographies is straightforward. Where only judge identifiers are given, these identifiers still almost always include a
variant of the judges’ initials. As well we observe entry and exit dates and which circuit a judge
id is identified with.

Notes: (a) Each panel reports on results of a one specification, run for each state separately across columns. (b) All
regressions include defendant’s race, gender, age, age squared, and an indicator for recidivism. All regressions also
include the case’s severity, and the number of charges in each case. Finally, all regressions include judge fixed effects
and year as well as three quarter-of-year fixed effects. (c) This Table’s specifications are based on Panel A of Table 3.
Panels A–B re-code recidivism as a dummy, or omit it. (The number of observations goes up in some states because
fewer observations are absorbed by recidivism-category fixed effects.) Panel C add sentencing guidlines as a control
variable. (d) Standard errors are two-way clustered by calendar-year and quarter-of-year. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1

To confirm that the broad patterns in the sentencing data are consistent in all states, Online
Appendix Table 4 reports the coefficients on defendant characteristics (race, gender and recidivism) that went unreported Table 3. All of these patterns have the expected signs, match previous
research, and are sign consistent with each other: judges in all states pass shorter sentences for
women, judges in all but one state pass longer sentences for black defendants, and judges in
all states pass longer sentences for recidivists. The coefficient on recidivism is the most variable
across the states, which reflects the fact that —unlike the race and gender dummies— the recidivism dummy can cloud substantial variation in the degree of recidivism. This is discussed in
footnote 21.

Georgia, there were 3 different election dates within our data.) This figure reports on the estimated quarterly dummies

Online Appendix – Not for Publication

One concern with our omission of cases between the filing date and the general election date
is that judges may , instead of levying harsher sentences in the lead-up to the filing date, postpone
contentious or visible cases until after the filing date to avoid a challenger running against them on
the basis of a contentious ruling. If this was the case we would expect some bunching of cases after
the filing date, and we would expect this to be concentrated in the severe cases. Online Appendix
Figure 2 presents the results of a McCrary (2008) test to test for this. There is no evidence of
bunching either side of the filing date for severe-crime cases (top-panel). The associated test shows
a log difference in height of 0.015, with a standard error of 0.042, giving rise to a t-statistic of 0.359,
i.e., the hypothesis of no bunching is not rejected. But there is some evidence for bunching of
non-severe cases before the filing date (bottom-panel). The associated test shows a log difference
in height of −0.061, with a standard error of 0.015, giving rise to a t-statistic of −4.11. If anything,
this suggests that judges may try to get smaller cases dealt with before the filing date in case they
need to devote some of their time after the filing date to the campaign trail.

Notes: (a) This figure shows the McCrary Test for bunching of a running variable (McCrary, 2008). In our case, that
running variable is days within an election cycle, centered around the filing date. The sample is cases that fall within six
month either side of a filing date and inside the same electoral cycle. (b) The top-panel displays the test for 25,000 severecrime cases. The bottom-panel displays the test for 202,000 non-severe cases. (Because the number of observations in
the bottom panel is very large, the scatter has to use coarser bins than the smoothing function so that it lies everywhere
above the smoothed function.) (c) The associated test in the top-panel shows a log difference in height of 0.015, with
a standard error of 0.042, giving rise to a t-statistic of 0.359, i.e. the hypothesis of no bunching is not rejected. The
associated test in the bottom-panel shows a log difference in height of −.061, with a standard error of 0.015, giving rise
to a t-statistic of −4.11.

In Table 7, we set the measures of electoral competition to zero in Virginia, where judges are
