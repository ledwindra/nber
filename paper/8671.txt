Dollarization, Inflation and Growth
Sebastian Edwards and I. Igal Magendzo
NBER Working Paper No. 8671
December 2001
JEL No. F3, F4

ABSTRACT
In this paper we analyze the macroeconomic record of dollarized economies. In particular, we
investigating whether, as its supporters’ claim, dollarization is associated with lower inflation and faster
growth. We analyze this issue by using a matching estimator technique developed in the training
evaluation literature. Our findings suggest that inflation has been significantly lower in dollarized nations
than in non-dollarized ones. We also find that dollarized nations have had a lower rate of economic
growth than non-dollarized ones. Finally, we find that macroeconomic volatility is not significantly
different across dollarized and non-dollarized economies. We conjecture that the lower rate of economic
growth in dollarized countries is due, at least in part, to these countries’ difficulties in accommodating
external disturbances, such as major term of trade and capital flows shocks.

I. Introduction
The recurrence of currency crises in emerging countries has generated an intense
debate on exchange rate policies. Pegged-but-adjustable exchange rate regimes have
rapidly lost adepts, while hard pegs and freely floating rates have gained in popularity
(See Summers 2000 and Fischer, 2001). A growing number of economists have gone as
far as arguing that (many) emerging nations should completely give up their national
currencies, and adopt an advanced nation’s currency as legal tender. This policy proposal
has come to be known by the general name of “dollarization.” Recently, some emerging
countries have, indeed, decided to officially dollarize their economies. In 2000, for
example, and in the midst of a major crisis, Ecuador abolished its currency, the Sucre,
and adopted the U.S. dollar. El Salvador adopted the dollar during 2001; and in May
2001, the dollar became legal tender in Guatemala.1
Supporters of dollarization have argued that countries that give up their currency
will be unable to engage in monetary and macroeconomic mismanagement. Public
finances will stay in balance, macroeconomic policy (or what is left of it) will be
credible, and the external accounts will move within reasonable bounds. According to
this view, dollarization will have two major positive effects on economic performance:
First, inflation will be lower in dollarized than in non dollarized nations. Alesina and
Barro (2001 p. 382), for instance, have argued that adopting another nation’s currency
“eliminates the inflation-bias problem of discretionary monetary policy.” Second,
countries that give up their currency will tend to grow faster than non-dollarized
countries. This growth effect is supposed to take place through two channels: (a)
dollarization will mean lower interest rates, higher investment, and faster growth
(Dornbusch 2001). And (b), by eliminating exchange rate volatility, dollarization is
suppose to encourage international trade and this, in turn, will result in faster growth.
Rose (2000), and Rose and Van Wincoop (2001), among others, have emphasized this
trade channel. 2 Other authors, however, have voiced skepticism regarding the alleged
1

By “officially dollarized” countries, we mean countries that use another nation’s currency. This “other
currency” needs not be the U.S. dollar, however. We have excluded countries that use a common supranational currency, such as the Euro. On the selection of exchange rate regimes see, for example, Frankel
(1999). On analytical aspects of dollarization see Calvo (2001) and Eichengreen and Haussman (1999).
On currency unions see Frankel and Rose (1999).

positive effects of dollarization on growth and overall macroeconomic performance.
According to Eichengreen (2001) the evidence on the relationship between monetary
regimes and growth is inconclusive, and does not support the claim that dollarization – or
any exchange rate regime, for that matter – is an important determinant of growth.3 The
traditional view, on the other hand, is that in countries with a hard peg it is difficult to
accommodate external shocks, including terms of trade and world interest rate
disturbances. According to him, this will be translated into greater instability and lower
economic growth (Fischer 1976). And Frankel (1999) has argued that there is no unique
recipe on exchange rate policy; while some countries will benefit from hard pegs, for
other countries a floating regime will be more appropriate.
Surprisingly, until very recently there have been no formal empirical studies on
the economic consequences of dollarization. In particular, international comparative
studies on alternative exchange rate and monetary regimes have traditionally ignored
dollarized countries. For instance, the comprehensive study on exchange rate regimes,
growth, and inflation by Gosh et al (1995), does not include nations that do not have a
currency of their own. Likewise, the IMF (1997) study on alternative exchange rate
systems excludes dollarized countries, and the recent paper by Levy-Yeyeti and
Sturzenegger (2001) on exchange rates and economic performance excludes nations that
do not have a central bank. This lack of empirical evidence means that countries that are
contemplating dollarization have very little information on how other countries have
historically performed under this monetary regime. In fact, most existing evidence on
dollarization is based on the experience of Panama, a country that has used the US dollar
as legal tender since 1904.4
The purpose of this paper is to analyze the historical macroeconomic record of
dollarized economies. More specifically, we are interested in investigating whether, as its
supporters argue, dollarization is associated with superior macroeconomic performance,
3

Other authors that have been skeptical regarding the benefits of dollarization include Corbo, Velasco
(2001) and Willet (2001). For a defense of dollarization see Hausmann (1999).

Goldfjan and Olivares (2001) use econometric techniques to evaluate Panama’s experience with
dollarization. Moreno-Villalaz (1999) provides a detailed analysis of the Panamanian system. Bogetic
(2000) describes several aspects of dollarization in a number of countries. As far as we know, Edwards
(2001) is the first paper to provide a statistical and econometric analysis of economic performance in
dollarized nations. The Edwards (2001) paper, however, is subject to some of the “control group”
problems we discussed below.

3

as measured by lower inflation and faster growth. Performing this type of international
comparison, however, is not easy. The problem is how to define an appropriate “control”
group with which to compare the dollarized nations. Since dollarization is not a “natural
experiment,” using a broad control group of all non-dollarized emerging countries is
likely to result in biased estimates. In this paper we tackle this issue by using a matching
estimator technique developed in the training evaluation literature (Heckman et. al.
1997). Our findings suggest quite strongly that inflation has been significantly lower in
dollarized nations, than in non-dollarized ones. We also find that dollarized nations have
had a lower rate of economic growth than non-dollarized ones. Statistically speaking,
however, this result is not as strong as our finding on inflation differentials. Finally, we
find that macroeconomic instability – measured by the degree of volatility of GDP
growth – is not significantly different across dollarized and non-dollarized economies.
We conjecture that the lower rate of economic growth in dollarized countries is
due, at least in part, to these countries’ difficulties in accommodating external
disturbances, such as major term of trade and capital flows shocks. Unfortunately, the
lack of data precluded us from investigating this issue formally. Preliminary results for
the case of Panama reported in Edwards (2001), however, provide some support for this
view. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section II we provide a
preliminary analysis of historical experiences with “dollarization.” In Section III we
present our empirical analysis using matching estimators. In Section IV we provide some
concluding remarks.

Dollarization Experiences During 1970-1998

II.1 Historical Experiences
Countries that use a foreign currency as legal tender can be divided into two
groups. The first one corresponds to independent nations, while the second group
includes territories, colonies or regions within a national entity. Panama is an example of
the first type of country, while Puerto Rico belongs to the second group. Table 1 contains
a list of countries (Panel A) and territories (Panel B) that have had an official dollarized
system at any time during the 1970-1998 period. 5 We have included information on
5

We follow the U.S. Congress’ Joint Economic Committee, and concentrate on those territories that have
a high degree of administrative autonomy. There are some borderline cases, however, that may generate
some controversies.

4

population, and on the currency (or currencies) used as legal tender. As may be seen, the
countries and territories that have had a dollarized monetary system are very small
indeed. Many are city-states well integrated into their neighbors’ economies – Monaco,
Lichtestein, the Vatican and Andorra are good examples. Some of them are not only tiny,
but also have an exciting and romantic origin. This is the case of Pitcairn Island, the
place where a group of English mutineers and Tahitian women settled in 1790. Many of
the dollarized economies are so small that they do not have data on basic economic
indicators such as inflation or growth. We have been able to collect data on growth for 12
of the 14 independent countries, and for 3 of the territories. Inflation data are available
for 9 of the independent countries and for the same 3 territories (See Table 1).
The largest dollarized countries in Panel A are Liberia and Panama. Only the
latter, however, remains dollarized today; Liberia abandoned the system in the 1980s,
when the government of President Samuel Doe decided to issue local currency as a way
of avoiding the constraints imposed on policy by the dollarized system.6 The largest
dollarized territory is Puerto Rico with little under 4 million people, and the smallest is
Pitcairn Island with 50 people. In 1998 the median population in the independent
dollarized countries’ was 63,000 people; the median population in the territories was
even smaller, at 19,000 people. Another characteristic of these economies is that they
are extremely open. In most of them there are no controls on capital mobility or on any
type of financial transactions. So much so, that 6 out of the 14 independent dollarized
nations are in the OECD list of “Unfair Tax Havens,” or countries whose lax financial
regulations, according to the OECD, allow individuals and corporations to evade taxes.
These fundamental characteristics of the dollarized economies – very small and
extremely open – already suggest that using a broad control group of all non-dollarized
countries, which are much larger and not as open, may indeed generate biased results.7

6

It is not easy to date unequivocally Liberia’s abandonment of the dollarized system. In July 1974 the
National Bank of Liberia (NBL) was opened. In 1982 the NBL began issuing five-dollar coins, and in
1989 it began issuing five-dollar notes. On Liberia’s dollarization experience see Barret (1995) and
Berkeley (1993).
7
The median population of all non-dollarized emerging nations is over 100 times larger than that of the
dollarized economies.

5

II.2 Comparative Analysis With an Unadjusted Control Group
In Table 2 we present, for the dollarized economies for which we have
information, summary statistics on inflation, per capita GDP growth, and the standard
deviation of growth. In order to put things in perspective we also present data on these
three variables for an “unadjusted” control group that includes all countries with a
currency of their own. This unadjusted control group contains 4,910 observations. In
Column (C) we present data on mean and median differences between dollarized and
non-dollarized countries for each of the three macroeconomic variables of interest. The
numbers in parenteses are t-statistics for the significance of these differences. The test
for the means differences is a standard t-statistic, while the medians differences test is a ttest obtained using a bootstrapping procedure. These results indicate that the difference in
inflation means is very large and statistically significant; on average inflation in
dollarized nations has been 55 percentage points lower than in non dollarized countries.
The difference in inflation medians is still negative, much smaller (- 5 percentage points),
and still statistically significant. The difference in GDP growth means is –0.7 percentage
points, and statistically significant; the difference in medians is – 1.4percentage points,
and is also statistically significant. The results for growth volatility are mixed: while the
difference in medians is statistically negative, the difference in means is not statistically
different from zero. We also computed a non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis χ 2 tests on the
equality of the distributions of the dollarized and non-dollarized groups. These tests
indicate that the two groups had different distributions during the period under study.
Using a slightly narrower control group comprised of emerging markets only did not alter
the conclusions in Table 2.
As pointed out earlier, a potential limitation of these comparisons is that the
control group may not be the appropriate one. If this is the case, the results presented in
Table 2 may be biased. In section III we deal with this issue in detail and we report new
results obtained using a technique aimed at defining appropriate control groups.

Dollarization and Performance: A Matching Estimator Approach

III.1 Methodological Issues
Comparative macroeconomic analyses have traditionally relied on regression
equations of the following type:

6

(1)

y j t = β x j t + γ D j t + ε j t.

Where y is the variable of interest –GDP growth, say--, x is a vector of controlling
variables, D is the “event” or “treatment” dummy (dollarization, for example), and ε is an
error term. In this setting, the analyst is interested in estimating parameter γ, which
captures the effect of the “treatment” on the outcome variable y8. A potential problem
with this approach, however, is that the “treatment” – the decision to dollarize, in our
case -- may not be the result of a random experiment. If this is the case, the estimated
conditional effect of the “treatment” on y, will be a biased estimator of the “true” effect.
This bias will, generally, have two interrelated causes. First, the observable covariates (x)
may affect the outcome (y) in a non-linear fashion. In this nonlinear term is excluded
from the regression, we will face an “omitted variable” bias. Second, some of omitted
non-linear covariates may be related to the country’s dollarization decision.
One way of dealing with this problem is by using a matching estimators technique
developed in the training evaluation literature (see Blundell and Costa Dias, 2000).9 This
approach consists of using the available data to re-establish the conditions of a natural
experiment. A general advantage of this non-parametric method is that no particular
specification of the underlying model has to be assumed. We can restate the question at
hand – what is the effect of dollarization on performance –in the following way:
(2)

Ψ = E(y1 - y0/x,u,,D=1).

Where y1 is, say, per capita GDP growth in countries that receive the dollarization
“treatment,” y0 is per capita GDP growth in those that have not received the treatment,
and x are observable covariates, and u are unobservables. As before, D is a dummy
variable that takes the value of one if the observation is subject to the treatment, and the
value of zero otherwise. In words, equation (2) captures the mean effect of dollarization
8

In standard regression analysis the coefficient γ captures the mean effect of the “event” on y. It is
perfectly possible, however, to estimate the effect of the event on the median (or any other quantile) of the
dependent variable. In the empirical results presented below we focus both on mean and median
differences of the dependent variables.

7

on the dollarized countries’ performance. The analyst’s problem, however, is that he
does not have data to estimate E(y0/x,D=1), the “outcome” in dollarized countries, had
they not dollarized10. Matching estimators use the existing data to construct an
appropriate sample counterpart for the missing information. This is done by pairing each
dollarized country with countries from the non-dollarized group (Blundell and Costa Dias
2000). If the sample is large enough, for each treated (dollarized) observation we can
find, in principle, at least one untreated observation with exactly the same characteristics.
Each of these properly selected untreated observations provides the required
counterfactual for our comparative analysis.11 The problem is that under most general
conditions it is not possible to find an exact match between a treated and untreated
observation. The matching estimator method focuses on estimating an average version of
the parameter of interest12. That is, the matching estimator consists of obtaining the
difference in outcome as an average of the differences with respect to “similar” -- rather
than identical -- untreated outcomes. The matching estimator M̂ can be written as13:

Mˆ ( S ) = ∑ wi ( y i − ∑ Wij y j ) .

(3)

i∈T

j∈C

Where T and C are respectively the sets of treated and untreated countries, Wij are
weights attached to each untreated observation j that is “matched” with treated country i,

9
10

Lalonde (1986) is the classic paper on training evaluation.
If we estimate the equation above using all non-treated observations the selection bias is given by:

B ( x) = E (u 0 / x, D = 1) − E (u 0 / x, D = 0) .
11

In order to guarantee that all treated agents have such a counterpart in the population (not necessarily in
the sample) we also need to assume that 0 < Pr ob( D = 1 / x ) < 1 .
12
This averaged version is given by:

∫ E( y

1

M (S ) =

− y 0 / x, D = 1)dF ( x / D = 1)

S

∫ dF ( x / D = 1)

,

S

where S is a subset of the support of x given D=1.
See Blundell and Costa Dias (2000). Persson (2001) has used matching estimators in a study of
monetary unions and trade
13

8

and wi are the weights that allow us to reconstruct the outcome distribution for the treated
sample. Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983) have shown that an efficient and simple way to
perform this comparison is to rely on a propensity score, defined as the probability of
participation or treatment: P(x)=Prob(D=1/ x). In our case, this is the probability of a
country being dollarized. This reduces a multi-dimensional problem to a one-dimensional
problem, provided that we can estimate P(x). Instead of matching countries directly on all
of their characteristics, we can compare countries with similar probability of dollarizing.
In this paper, and in order to explore the robustness of the results, we use two
alternative methods for computing matching estimators. First, we use a simple-average
nearest neighbor estimator. According to this method, for each treated observation, we
select a pre-determined number of untreated nearest neighbor(s). The nearest neighbors
of a particular treated observation i are defined as those untreated observations that have
the smallest difference in propensity score with respect to i. If we choose to use nn
nearest neighbors, we set Wij =

1
for the observations that have been selected; for other
nn

observations we set Wij =0. We applied the above method to both one nearest neighbor
and five nearest neighbors. The second method consists of using local linear regressions
to identify each matching observation (Fan 1993).

III.2 Results
In this section we present the basic results from the computation of matching
estimators for inflation, growth and growth volatility for the period 1970-1998. The
section is organized as follows: we first present the results from a probit model of
dollarization, which we use to compute the propensity scores. We then report the results
obtained from the calculation of matching estimators proper.

Propensity Scores
We used a 199-country unbalanced panel data set to estimate a random-effect
probit model on the probability of a country being dollarized at a particular point in
time14. The dependent variable takes a value of one if country j is dollarized in year k.
Although many of the dollarized economies do not collect extensive data, we were able
14

We will use the term “country” to refer both to independent nations as well as to territories. On
propensity scores see, for example, Drake (1993) and Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983).

9

to obtain information on a number of covariates that capture geographical, economic and
political characteristics of the countries in the sample. The following independent
variables were used in the probit estimation: (a) Initial GDP, taken as a measure of the
country’s economic size. (b) Population measured in millions of people, as an alternative
index of size. (c) An indicator that measures the degree of openness of the economy. For
the majority of countries and years we used the Sachs and Warner (1995) openness index,
that takes a value of one if the country in question is open to international trade, and zero
otherwise15. We used data from a variety of sources to supplement the Sachs-Warner
index for those countries and years not covered in their sample. (d) A dummy variable
that takes the value of one if the country in question is an island. (e) A dummy variable
that takes the value of one if the country has a common boarder with a nation whose
currency is defined by the IMF as a “convertible currency.” (f) A variable that measures
the country’s geographical location, as captured by its latitude. And (g), a dummy
variable that takes the value of one if the economy in question is an independent nation16.
The data set covers 1970 through 1998, and has a total of 5,290 observations, of which
386 correspond to dollarized economies. The results obtained are summarized in Table
3, and provide useful information on the probability of a country being dollarized. For
example, according to these results smaller, non-independent economies are more likely
to be dollarized. Also, more open economies that have a common border with a country
with a convertible currency have a higher probability of being dollarized. As may be
seen, the fit is quite satisfactory, with the pseudo R2 exceeding 0.43. The estimated
probabilities of being dollarized obtained from this equation were used to define the
matching observations in the computation of alternative matching estimators17.

Nearest Neighbor Matching Estimators
We computed nearest neighbor estimators “with replacement” and “without
replacement.” In the “with replacement” case an observation for an untreated country
15

See the original Sachs-Werner (1995) article for a specific list of requirements for a country to qualify
as “open.”
16
Unfortunately, only three of the dollarized economies have data on other variables of interest, including
terms of trade, investment, the fiscal balance, and interest rates.
17
As an alternative method, for each dollarized country we restricted the matching observations to
correspond to the same non-dollarized country for every year in the sample. In order to do this, the
propensity scores were re-calculated from a cross-country probit regression for 1970. The results obtained

10

may be selected as the nearest neighbor for several dollarized countries. In the “without
replacement” case each untreated country observation may be the nearest neighbor to
only one dollarized country in a particular year. This option requires more data points but
reduces the risk of using too few comparison countries. In terms of number of neighbors,
we considered both “one nearest neighbor” as well as “five nearest neighbors.” In total,
then, we use four “adjusted” control groups:

•

One nearest neighbor, with replacement;

•

One nearest neighbor, without replacement;

•

Five nearest neighbors, with replacement;

•

Five nearest neighbors, without replacement.

In Table 4 we summarize some key data for the “adjusted” control groups
constructed using the propensity scores methodology. For comparison purposes we also
present data on the dollarized economies, and on all non-dollarized economies – the latter
group is the “unadjusted” control group used in the previous section. Simple inspection
reveals that the new control groups have a greater degree of similarity with the dollarized
nations, than the original unadjusted control group. For example, the new control groups
include economies that are smaller, more open and have a higher initial income per capita
than the average for the unadjusted sample. This table also reflects the fact that the
“adjusted” control groups have a significantly smaller number of observations (or
“controls”) than the unadjusted control group made of all non-dollarized economies.
The matching estimators results are presented in Table 5. For each variable of
interest –inflation, growth, and volatility -- we report data on (a) the number of countries
and number of observations in the control group; (b) The “mean difference,” calculated
as the mean of the differences obtained from the dollarized economies minus the
corresponding non-dollarized control group. And (c) the “median difference,” calculated
as the median of the differences obtained from the dollarized economies minus the
corresponding non-dollarized control group. For both the mean and the median
difference we present, in parentheses, a t-statistic for their statistical significance. As in
Table 2 the test for the mean difference is a standard t-statistic, while that for the
from these country-to-country matching estimators are very similar to those reported in Table 6 and are not
reported due to space considerations. They are available on request.

11

difference in median was calculated using a bootstrapping procedure. Finally, and for
comparison purposes, we report again the means and medians differences obtained when
the unadjusted control group of all dollarized countries is used .. We refer to these
differences as “unadjusted comparisons.”
Our results can be summarized as follows: First, for every one of the matching
indicators both the mean and median difference in inflation are negative and significantly
different from zero. This indicates that the dollarized economies have had significantly
lower yearly rate of inflation than the non-dollarized countries. According to these
results, however, the mean difference in inflation is much smaller that what the simple,
uncorrected comparisons would suggest. Indeed, while the “unadjusted means
difference” in inflation is –55 percentage points per year, the mean difference obtained
using matching estimators range from -3.5 to -5.7 percentage points per year. Second, for
every one of the matching indicators the GDP per capita growth differences are negative.
They are significantly so in seven out of the eight estimators reported in Table 5; the only
exception is for the mean difference using one nearest neighbor. Overall we interpret
these results as providing fairly strong evidence that, once appropriate control groups are
defined, the dollarized economies have tended to experience lower GDP per capita
growth than the non-dollarized ones. This conclusion is, in fact, supported by the local
linear regression results reported below. In terms of magnitudes, the estimated
differentials in growth obtained from the matching estimators appear to be slightly larger
than the unadjusted comparisons. And third, statistically speaking, there are no
differences (either in the means or medians) in volatility in dollarized and non-dollarized
economies. This contrast with the results obtained from the raw comparisons, which
suggested that volatility was significantly higher in the dollarized nations.

III.3 Extensions: Local Linear Regressions
The results reported in Table 5 were obtained using an average nearest neighbor
approach. An alternative method for computing matching estimators consists of using
local linear regressions (LLR), a non-parametric technique similar to traditional kernel
regression18. When using this method the weights in equation (3) are given by:
18

This estimator improves on kernel regression in two ways: a) the bias of the LLR estimator does not
depend on the design density of the data (i.e. on the density f(P(x)); and b) the order of convergence is the
same at the boundry points as at the interior points. For details see Fan (1992, 1993).

) and Pi = P ( xi ) . And, as before, P(x)=Prob(D=1/ x), is the

propensity score, defined as the probability of participation or treatment.
An alternative, but equivalent, way of implementing LLR is the following: For
each treated observation we run a weighted least square regression of the outcomes on the
differences of the propensity scores. The intercept from this weighted regression is a
good estimate of E ( y 0i / xi ), D = 1) -- see Fan (1992, 1993). The weights can be chosen
using any standard Kernel function and selecting an adequate bandwidth. LLR can be
interpreted as solving the following problem:

where a and b are parameters, j indexes untreated observations and i refers to treated
observations. The results obtained when this LLR matching method was used confirmed
those presented in Table 5. What is particularly important in terms of this paper, is that
these estimates indicate that GDP per capita growth has indeed been significantly lower
in the dollarized countries than in the non-dollarized ones. The estimated means
difference in GDP growth per capita using the LLR is –1.16, with a t-statistic of –5.34.
The estimated difference in medians is –1.32 with a t-statistic of –8.31.

IV.

Concluding Remarks
In the aftermath of the currency crises of the 1990s some economists have argued

that the emerging economies should give up their domestic currencies, and adopt an
advanced nation’s currency as legal tender. Interestingly, there have been no systematic
comparative studies on the performance of countries that, indeed, officially use another
nations’ currency. Most of the literature on the subject has been based on case studies of

13

Panama. This lack of empirical analyses has resulted in policy debates that, until now,
have been based on conjectures and not on hard historical evidence.
The purpose of this paper has been to analyze, from a comparative perspective,
economic performance in “dollarized” economies. We have argued that the main
difficulty in performing this type of comparison refers to defining the correct “control
group” with which to compare the performance of the dollarized countries. In this paper
we tackled this issue by using the “matching estimators” technique developed in the
training evaluation literature. We found that the matching estimators technique yield
somewhat different results than raw comparisons using a large control group of all nondollarized countries. More specifically, we found that dollarized countries have had a
significantly lower rate of inflation than non-dollarized ones. The mean difference
ranged from 3.4% to 5.7% per year. We also found that dollarized countries have had a
statistically lower rate of GDP per capita growth than non-dollarized ones. Both the
mean and median growth differences are approximately 1% per year. Finally, we found
that there has been no statistical difference in macroeconomic volatility between
dollarized and non-dollarized economies.
The results reported here do not imply that dollarization is an inferior monetary
arrangement for all countries. Indeed, our results only refer to an historical comparison
of the performance of economies that have had an official dollarized regime. As data
from more recent experiences with “dollarization” become available, it will be possible to
gain further insights into the performance of countries that adopt this monetary regime.
In particular, the recent cases of Ecuador, El Salvador and Guatemala will provide
information on how mid-size economies fare under this regime.
