    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper provides a broad overview of recent trends in solid waste and recycling, related public policy issues, and the economics literature devoted to these topics.  Public attention to solid waste and recycling has increased dramatically over the past decade both in the United States and in Europe.  In response, economists have developed models to help policy makers choose the efficient mix of policy levers to regulate solid waste and recycling activities.  Economists have also employed different kinds of data to estimate the factors that contribute to the generation of residential solid waste and recycling and to estimate the effectiveness of many of the policy options employed.\n\n",
