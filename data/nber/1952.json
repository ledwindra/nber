The major finding is that there is substantial\ndispersion in wages across industries, even after allowing for measured and\nunmeasured labor quality, working conditions, fringe benefits, transitory\ndemand shocks, threat of unionization, union bargaining power, firm size and\nother factors. Some direct evidence in favor of efficiency wage theories is\npresented. The evidence suggests that industry wage differentials are\nsuccessful in eliciting better performance through reduced turnover and\nincreased effort.\n\n",
