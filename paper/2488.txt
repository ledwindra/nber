Consumer Durables and the Optimality of Usually Doing Nothing
ABSTRACT

This paper develops a simple but important point which is often
overlooked:

It is quite possible that the best policy for a rational,

optimizing agent is to do nothing for long periods of time—-even if new,
relevant information becomes available.

We illustrate this point using the

Lumpy costs in durables transactions

consumers to choose a finite range, not just a single level, for their

durables consumption.

The boundaries of this range change with new

information and, in general, obey the permanent income hypothesis.

However,

as long as the durable stock is within the chosen region, the consumer will
not change her stock.

Hence individuals will make durable transactions

infrequently and their consumption can differ substantially

from the

prediction of the strict PIH.

behavior means that aggregate data cannot be generated

by a representativeagent; explicit aggregation is required.

RATIONAL INERTIA: BASIC IDEAS
The standard type of optimizing behavior posited in economic models is

continuous reoptimizatlon. According to this view of behavior, the Individual
or firm controlling a decision variable, xt, Is given new constraints and/or
information each period (call that the vector zt), computes the value of the

decision variable that maximizes his objective function (call it
then sets

xt=4

4),

and

in every period. This optimum Is normally defined by some

kind of tangency condition. Examples abound. In consumption theory, x' is
consumption,

expectations

and wealth, and
zt Includes interest rates, current income
about the future; the "Euler equation" Is based on the notion

1

that the consumer optimizes intertemporally in both period t and period t÷1.
In portfolio theory, xt is a vector of portfolio shares and zt includes
current wealth and the presumed varlance—covariance matrix;

wealthhoiders

are supposed to adjust their portfolios every time their perceived
variance—covariance

matrix changes.

Figure 1 is a trivially simple graph displaying this general idea. Here
V(x;z) is the objective function, which moves any time z changes. The

decision maker Is assumed always to select

x = argmax V(x;z) (point

It seems doubtful, however, that many people behave this way ——

especially

If the period is relatively short. (The authors of this paper

certainly don't.) Instead, people are alleged to be 'creatures of habit."
Econometric evidence certainly supports the general idea that behavior is
inertial. For example, empirically estimated

"does nothing." We like to think of this conclusion as showing that what

Akerlof and Yellen (1985) called near rationality is actually full
rationality. In the presence of fixed transactions costs, continuous
reoptimization would be Irrational.

While literally fixed costs are the easiest case to understand, they ar€
not needed to rationalize inertial behavior. Any type of lumpy transactions
cost will do. Such costs, we would argue, are pervasive facts of economic
life. In some contexts, there are explicit transactions costs ——

such as the

large commission a real-estate agent receives for selling your house, or the

costs a firm Incurs In printing and distributing new price lists ("menu
costs"). These costs probably have much to do with why people change houses
Infrequently,1 why Investors do not reoptimize their stock portfolios every

morning,2 and why firms do not change prices every time either demand or cost
changes .3
In other cases, the costs may be implicit. Sometimes the cost Is a time
cost, as when consumers spend hours searching for Information on performance
characterislcs and prices of heterogeneous durable goods —-

not

to mention

ci

houses or jobs. Other times, the transactions cost Is more naturally
expressed as a utility cost, as when the individual finds the process of
change or acquiring Information inherently distasteful. (Job Interviews and
moving may be good examples.) Or the Implicit cost may simply arise from the
fact that a human being can only cope with so many problems at once, a point

3

often stressed by Herbert Simon. Hence there is a kind of "shadow cost" for
using the scarce resource of mental capacity.

(Why else would CEOs delegate

decisions?>
Finally,

some markets have large spreads between the prices at which you

can buy and sell, so that a buyer loses a lump of value the moment he takes
the good home. This type of lumpy cost is particularly prevalent in the

markets for consumer durables. One rationalizationwas provided by Akerlof
(1970), who argued that markets in which goods are heterogeneous and quality
is not readily observable are subject to the "lemons principle." (If this is
a good car, why are you selling It?) Whether or not caused by the lemons

principle, the gap between buying and selling prices may be a major reason
why any one consumer is active in the market for any particular durable only
sporadically.

The rest of the time, he Is "doing nothing."

Of course, the econometric fact that xt_1 is almost always a significant
determinant of xt has been noti'

1

many times before. The usual "explanation"

is the partial-adjustmentmodel, according to which convex costs of changing

x make

it optimal to adjust xt to

x

gradually.

Under the assumption that

adjustment costs are quadratic, a linear partial-adjustment rule like:

xt

-

xt_1

=

* -

x(xt

xt_1)

can be derived from rigorous microfoundations.

And so the assumption is

frequently made, usually without thinking twice about what it means.
There are two major problems with this common approach (and many others
in particular applications).

The first

is

empirical: the estimated value of A

is almost always "implausibly slow" when interpreted as a speed of

adjustment. The second Is theoretical:while the existence of adjustment
costs is believable, the assumption that they are convex, much less
quadratic, is not in most applications. Think, for example, of money demand,

4

where the partial-adjustment model

is

almost universally employed. Can anyone

take seriously the hypothesis that the cost of changing your cash balance by
$100 rather than $99 greatly exceeds the cost of changing it by $1 rather
than zero? Or think about applying the quadratic assumption to adjustment
costs for installing fixed capital, where it has been used to rationalize the
Q-theory of investment,4 Does a firm really incur much higher adjustment
costs for the sixteenth

drill press it installs than for the first? Other

examples could be listed. Frankly, we find it hard to think of many cases in
which the assumption of

jaj

plausible than the assumption of

marginal adjustment costs is more

riin,

or even zero, marginal

adjustment costs.
This is not just a minor theoretical quibble. While quadratic adjustment
costs make partial adjustment optimal, zero or decreasing marginal adjustment
costs make it optimal to adjust all at once or not at all. Look back at
Figure 1 once again. If the decisionmaker

must pay a lumpy transactions cost

each time he changes x, he will not adjust x toward x* in small increments
period after period. Instead, he will either do nothing or jump all the way
to x* at once. Partial adjustment

is

simply too costly when transactions

costs are lumpy. (Think, for example, of the costs you would incur in selling
and buying a car every month,)
The case of fixed transactions costs has been extensively studied in the
inventory literature, where the so—called (S,s) or two—bin policy emerges as
the optimal strategy in awide range of circumstances. Specifically (see
Figure 2), firms facing i.i.d. demand shocks will find it optimal to set a
lower bound on inventory,

s, and then tO restore inventories

to S each time

that lower limit is reached. If demand is serially correlated, or if
something else is changing through time, the rule becomes an (St,

policy.

The (S,s) :nventory Policy

We show below that the (St,st) rule is optimal for consumers buying
durables whose selling prices are lower than buying prices —— due, say, to
the lemons principle.5 But this is just one example of what we think is a
very general phenomenon. The same logic applies to business purchases of
capital

goods, where adjustment cost functions are unlikely to resemble those

assumed by Q-theory, Instead, elements of fixed costs probably dictate that
an (S,s) rule be followed.

Obviously,

inventories

are the application for

which (S,s) rules were invented; and (S,s) inventory management rules are
apparently in wide use. Switching to financial decisions, the Baumol-Tobin
model

of transactions demand for money, when properly thought through

(remember

the saw-tooth diagram?) is an (S,s) rule for money demand.

And the

matrix to take account of

new information (and then of calling your broker with instructions)

suggest

that optimal portfolios probably should follow a multi—dimensional (S,s) rule
rather than, say, the standard CAPH solution.6 As noted above, "sticky"
prices are probably more sensibly rationalized by fixed menu costs than by
quadratic adjustment costs. And the standard assumption in dynamic theories
of labor demand ——

that

hiring new workers ——

a firm incurs rising marginal adjustment costs in

is difficult to believe.

More likely, its marginal

adjustment costs are declining, in which case some kind of (S,s) rule will be
optimal rather than the partial—adjustmentrule used, e.g., by Sargent

(1978).7
Finally, we offer an admittedly speculative application of (S,s)
reasoning to the debate over rational expectations.

model. Then their actual expectations will exhibit inertial behavior: people
will stick to previous forecasts until they have good reason to believe that
recalculation will yield benefits large enough to repay the costs.

At

the micro level, this sort of inertial behavior is quite different from
the gradual adjustment considered by Taylor (1975) and Friedman (1979).
Whether or not expectations appear close to adaptive at the macro level
depends on whether people change their forecasts asynchronously or all at
once.

In all these applications and more we believe that the particular
version of inertia embodied in (S,s) rules is a more plausible
characterization of optimal behavior than the partial-adjustmentmodel. But
the discussion so far has been entirely intuitive.

It Is now time to prove

that the (S,s) rule is optimal for purchases of consumer durables.

2. AN (S,s) RULE FOR CONSUMER DURABLES: THE CERTAINTY CASE

Suppose a consumer derives utility from two comodities:

a perishable

good X and a durable good K which depreciates at a constant exponential rate
i.

Denote by q <

1 the ratio of the selling price of durables to the buying

price; thus the lumpy transactions cost incurred in replacing a durable good
Is a fraction 1—q of the purchase price.

Assume the instantaneous

utility

function takes the usual PIH form:
u(Kt,Xt) =

aK + bX,

y <

1,

where we assume, as is usual, that the flow of services from durables is
proportional to the stock. Assuming time separability and an infinite
horizon, the consumer wants to maximize:

7

U =

J
0

u(Kt,Xt)etdt,

where p is the rate of subjective time discounting.
It is clear that, because of the lumpy transactions costs, durable
purchases will take place only occasionally, for continuous replacement would
imply infinite transactions costs.

g

Proof:
It is easier to prove the theorem by defining the consumption plan by
(S,t,X), where t is the vector of purchase dates, than by (S,s,X).

We want

to show that if (S*,t*,X) is the optimal consumption plan when wealth is (W,
K0) then (cS*,t*,cXt) is optimal when wealth is (cW

cK0).

Since the budget

constraint is linear, the feasibility of (S*,t*,X) with wealth (W, K0)
immediately

implies that (cS*,t*,cX) Is feasible with wealth (cW, cK0).

The

homogeneity of the utility function implies that If (S*,t*,X) is preferred
to (S',t,X), then (cS*,t*,c4) is preferred to (cS',t',cX) for every c >

0,

Therefore (cS*,t*,cX) is optimal with wealth (cW, cK0) and part (1) of

the theorem is established.
The above applies to the optimal consumption plan starting at time 0.
But since the utility function is assumed to be stationary and the horizon is
infinite,

the same comparisons can be made at other starting times.

Therefore, the optimal consumption plan beginning at time t1 will be
($S*,t*,14), if the new vector of wealth is ($W, AK) for some constant $.

The separability of both the utility function and the budget constraint

Q.E.O.

Where nondurables are concerned, Theorem

I

simply repeats the standard

implications of the PIH, omitting the obvious (but important) point that the
time pattern of income is irrelevantto the time pattern of consumption
('transitory income doesnt matter'). This, of course, is a direct product of
our assumption of separability in the utility function.

For durables,

however, Theorem 1 modifies the PIH in several important respects.
The simplest way to describe these changes is to say that the PIN holds
in the "long run' but not in the "short run.' Specifically,

Figure 3 shows

the optimal path for durables, which follows a sawtooth pattern.

The width of

the "corridor" in which the sawtooth takes place, log(S/s), depends mainly on

q, the extent of lumpy transactions costs. (As q

-*

0,

the corridor narrows

and durables behave just like nondurables.) Between purchase dates, there are
obviously deviations from the strict PIN, e.g., Kt is not proportional to Wt
for all t. But the corridor itself follows the standard PIN pattern: It rises
at rate g and its height (In levels) is proportional to lifetime wealth.

3. EXTENSION TO UNCERTAINTY

We conjecture that an analogous theorem holds when labor income is
stochastic.

After all, we know that (S,s) rules are optimal in a wide variety

of problems in which various things are random in various ways. Nonetheless,
extending the theorem to the case of uncertainty is not straightforward.
There are two main technical difficulties.
The first is that the proportionalityresult of the standard permanent
income theory without durables no longer holds when labor income Is
stochastic —— as Campbell (1986) and Hayashi (1982), among others, have
noted. Instead, the best that can be established

risk aversion utility and that labor income is given by:
Yt =
where

(1 + et),

is constant and et is a white noise disturbance,

The latter is a very

restrictive and empirically unattractive specification. However, It enables
him to prove that optimal consumption is homogeneous of degree one In the
vector (,A), where A Is nonhuman wealth. Notice that consumption Is not
proportional to A + H, where H is "human wealth,'

i.e., the expected

discounted present value of earnings. Instead, the ratio A/H affects
consumption. Since our Theorem 1 essentially grafts an (S,s) approach to
durabies onto the standard PIH, we cannot expect the proportionality result
to hold under uncertainty,
Second,

once unanticipated declines in permanent income are admitted,

it

becomes possible for a consumer to have a durable stock that is "too large
as well as one that is "too small." Hence, we must deal with two-sided (S,s)
policies.

In fact, the work of Grossman and Laroque (1987) suggests that the

optimal plan is actually described by four parameters: a lower limit, an
upper limit, and two target stocks. Specifically,

in a model with no labor

Income, stochastic property income, and no nondurable consumption good, but

otherwise identical to ours, they prove the following theorem:
Theorem (Grossman and Laroque):

Suppose the individual can Invest in a

riskless asset and n risky assets, all of which evolve as continuous—time Ito
processes. Then the optimal strategy for holding the durable good is
described by the following four—parameterextension of the (S,s) rule:

where (S,SL, SU, a) are all proportional to total wealth, A + K.

As the graph shows, SL is smaller than

S,

which seems odd at first. The reason Is that transactions costs lost in
selling a large durable good of size a exceed those lost In selling a small
durable of size

.10

HayashUs result

and Grossman and Laroque's

theorem lead us to the

following conjecture for our model with durables:

Conjecture:

Suppose the interest rate and the depreciation rate are

nonstochastic, the utility function is as assumed before, and human wealth
evolves according the Ito process:
dH/H =

gdt

+ wdz,

where dz is a standard Weiner process. Then the (s ,SL,

S,

rule

described

above is optimal and all four parameters are homogeneous of degree one in the
vector (A, H, K).

Notice that we do not claim that s, SL, Su

and

a

are proportional to

That is probably untrue. Under uncertainty, ratios like s/(A+H)

and a/(A-FH) presumably depend on the composition

of wealth, just as in

Hayashi's case. For example, since s is a linearly homogeneous function of
(K,A,H):
s =

f(K,A,H),

we know that:
s/H =

f(K/H,A/H,1).

At any moment at which the lower barrier is hit, K =
s/H =

f(s/H,

A/H,

5, so:

1),

which defines s/H as a function of A/H. Grossman and Laroque's theorem

14

:L

U

proves,

for their case, that this function has only one root.

We cannot simply adapt their proof because human capital is a nontraded
asset, whereas all of their assets are freely tradable. The technical problem
is that, while Grossman and Laroque can reduce their two state variables

(K

and A) to one, the best we can do is to reduce our three state variables

(K,

A, and H) to two. That makes the problem enormously more difficult and their

proof inapplicable to our case. We can, however, establish the homogeneity
result conditional

on the (s, SL,

S,

a) rule being optimal. Specifically, we

can prove:

Theorem 2: If the (s, SL,

Su

a) strategy is optimal, then s, SL,

S,

and a are all homogeneous of degree one in the vector (A, H, K).
Proof: The proof simply follows the logic of the first part of the proof

of Theorem 1. FIrst we show that if a strategy (s, SL,

S,

a) is feasible

when the wealth vector is (A, H, K), then a strategy (bs, bSL,

bS1j,

ba) is

feasible when the wealth vector Is (bA, bH, bK). To see this, start by
writing the laws of motion that hold whenever a durable purchase is not made:
dH/H =

gdt

dK/dt =

-

+ wdz

pIK

dA/dt = rA

+y

-

where y Is labor Income, defined by:

y

= rH —

dH/dt.

Clearly, these are all linear homogeneous. Furthermore, at instants at which
a durable purchase is made, we have:

A+-A=_Et

which are also linear homogenous. Thus, if A, H, y and K are all multiplied
by any constant b, we get a feasible solution by multiplying X, s, SL,

from the homogeneity of the utility function, just as before.

4, AGGREGATE

IMPLICATIONS

Though the (S,s) rule rests on solid microfoundations and is probably
optimal

in a wide variety of problems, it has not been used much in economics

because of the difficulties It poses for aggregation. Clearly, the fiction of
a representative agent will no longer do because decislonmakers hit their
trigger points at different times. In the context of consumer durables,

the

whole economy at any one time consists of a small number of people who spend
a lot and a large number of people who spend zero. Critics of the (S,s)
approach argue either that It cannot be aggregated or that, once aggregated,
it just leads back to the partial—adjustmentmodel. But, as one of us showed
several years ago (Blinder,

1981a), neither is quite true. This section is

devoted to drawing out the aggregate implications of the (S,s) model of
individual

purchases of consumer durables.

As usual, exact aggregation Is not possible In full generality;

special

assumptions must be invoked. We allow Individual consUmers to differ In two
respects.

First, people with the same (permanent)

Incomes will not hold the

same stocks of durables because of different past histories. Rather, they
will be at different points within the relevant (S,s) range. Second, people

16

have different permanent incomes, and hence different optimal (S,s) ranges.
For concreteness, we assume that there are n income groups with permanent
incomes (ordered from highest to lowest)

Suppose there is one homogeneous durable good, which we call a car, that
depreciates exponentially at rate i.11 The richest group buys new cars, holds
them for a period T1 defined by:

and so on. Since all the S's and S'S are proportional to the

corresponding y's, this puts an implicit constraint on the distribution of
income. Naturally, we do not believe that the income distribution adjusts to

clear the automobile market. Prices no doubt do most of the adjusting. In
addition,

there are many types of cars, not just one. Rather than (futilely)

attempt to solve the full general equilibrium problem, we simply assume that

This is, of course,

"one of those

But it seems a big improvement over assuming that

everyone is alike.
With an eye on the spending concept that appears in the national income
accounts,

that is, expenditures on new automobiles, we focus our attention on

the market for new cars and assume that the econometriclan gets observations
only quarterly even though people make decisions continuously. Only income
group 1 buys new cars, and each member of this group follows the purchase
rule:12

Here Kt is the quality of cars held at the start of period t and

However, the

Implications of (10) are far from transparent. To begin with, it may help to
work out a concrete example. The most obvious benchmark is the steady state
distribution of f(K). In a steady state, the age distribution of cars is

uniform between 0 and T

Ij;

that is, if h denotes age, the density

j=i

function of age is:

f(h)=i/T
= 0

0<h<T
otherwise

Age and automobile quality are related by:
K = S1

eh

So, by the usual formula for change-of-variables:

f(K) =

Thus the cumulative distribution function needed for (9) is:

where A is the ratio S1/y1.

Notice that (12) has an interesting accelerator mechanism which
disappears in the steady state, but which can cause large fluctuations in
aggregate demand in the short run. To show that this formula makes good
intuitive sense, let us insert some concrete numbers. Suppose I = 15 (say,
five income groups each holding for three years),

j

=

.20 (20% annual

depreciation rate), e = .25 (quarterly data), and income is constant.

Then E

= S1/60 per quarter or S1/15 per year, as is only natural.
We hardly needed a deep theory to tell us that, in a steady state with a
useful life of 15 years, 1/15 th of all households will buy a new car each
year. Of much greater interest are the non-steady-stateproperties of
equation (10). Let us ask first what happens if there is an 'income shock,"
meaning an unanticipated rise in permanent income, which perturbs the system
away from the steady state.

might encounter rising supply price. For another, a 1% rise in GNP does not
raise everyone's (permanent)

income by 1%, even if we ignore the distinction

between permanent and current income. Some people in the relevant range will
experience income increases much greater than 1%; but they will still raise
their car purchases from zero to one, not to two or three. Others will
experience no increase at all, and hence will not demand more cars. So, as Is
usual, heterogeneity tends to smooth things out. Finally, it is worth

pointing out that quarter-to-quarterchanges in purchases of durable goods
are quite variable; 20% increases or decreases are not unheard of, especially
for automobiles.
Of course, in the real world, It Is not only the richest consumers that
buy new cars. Fortunately, both the demand function (10) and the elasticity
result (13) can be generalized to allow for an arbitrary number of different
types of cars,

each with its own clientele.

for this elasticity to be far

above unity, the speed of adjustment must be a large multiple of the

estimates.
In fact, a well-known problem with stock-adjustmentmodels is that they
tend to produce implausibly small estimated "speeds of adjustment" —- the
coefficient A. The (S,s) model gives this econometric parameter an entirely

For the parameter values we have been using as examples (T=15, T1=3, ii=.2)

the expression above turns out to be —0.5 in annual data (0=1). But this is
strictly a steady—state estimate for a particular choice of parameter values.
The basic point is that, according to the (S,s) model, the estimate of 8E/8K
has nothing to do with how quickly people adjust to shocks.

It depends

mainly on the density function ft(Kt),

5. EMPIRICAL IMPLICATIONS AND TESTS

Equation (10) cannot be estimated by conventional econometric techniques
since we have no time series on the distribution function F(,). However, the
model can be tested informally by drawing out its implications for observable
variables and checking them against the data.
5.1

Relative Variances
One fairly clear implication of the model is that Nt, the number of units

purchased, should have much more time series variability than Ct, the average
purchase of those who make a purchase.

For the period over which data for Ct

and Nt exist for automobiles (1959:1 to 1987:2):13

a(AlogY)

= 0.010

25

t = real

where

disposable income per capita

Ct = average real car price paid by consumers
Nt =

per

capita sales of cars to consumers.

The theory clearly passes this crude test.
5.2

Tests of the "Random Walk" Hypothesis
Hall (1978) pointed out that nondurable consumption should,

approximately,

follow a random walk. More precisely, no variable dated t-1 or

earlier should help predict the change in consumption from t-1 to t. Since in
our model the variable Ct should follow the standard PIH precisely, Hall's
tests apply to this time series directly.

Mt does not obey the PIH. Specifically,

But, according to the (S,s) model,

it follows from (9) that both lagged

=
Nt and lagged income matter. So both Mt and Et

CtNt

should fall Hall's

tests.

We test these implications with quarterly data on automobile purchases
for the period 1960:1 to 1987:2.14
First, following Hall, we ask if Et = CtNt can be predicted by Its own
past values, other than Et_i.

The result is (with absolute t—ratios in

parentheses):

Et =

constant + 0.66Et_1
(7.0)

=

.77;

OW =

+ 0.23Et_2 — 0.O8Et_3 (2.3)

1.99; F(392)

(0.9)

= 1.89

(p =

0,O2Et4
(0.2)

.14).

The F test fails to reject the omission of longer lags; but that seems to be
a quirk, for the hypothesis was decisively rejected for several shorter
samples in earlier versions of this paper.15 Notice also that the coefficient
of Et_1 is far from the usual value, near unity. According to our theory, the
problems should come from Nt, not from Ct.
the following two regressions show.

26

That turns out to be the case, as

Ct =

at the 10%

level

in the Ct equation, which

resembles Halls regressions. But Nt_2 matters In the Nt equation; the
F-statistic for omitting the longer lags rejects the null hypothesis at well
beyond the 5% level.
Next, again following Hall, we ask if lagged values of disposable income
can predict expenditures on autos. The result is:
Et =

F(4,91) = 3.47 (p =

(0.2)

.011)

In this regression, the null hypothesis that all lagged V's can be excluded
Is easily rejected. Once again, the failure to reject comes from some

significant explanatory power of lagged income in predicting the number of
cars, but not the averaqe expenditure per car:

Ct =

constant + 1.OOCt1

R2 =

(1.7)

F(4,91) = 3,07 (p =

(0.2)

—
(0.2)

.020)

These results are generally favorable to the (S,s) model.

In particular,

rejections of the simple PIH using data on durables stem from the behavior of
Nt, not from the behavior of Ct, just as our model predicts.

27

5.3 Reactions to Income Changes
The next testable implications follow from the earlier discussion of
income elasticities. In the long—run, the number of buyers is constant and S1
is proportional to permanent income. So the long—run elasticity should be

exactly one. But the theory calls for a short—run elasticity well in excess
of one, and hence it predicts considerable overshooting. Furthermore, since
an income shock in period t changes the distribution of initial stocks
carried into the next period, it affects Et+i and thus reverberates for a
long while in complex ways. However, the model gives us some hints about what
the dynamic reactions of E to V should look like. After a positive income
shock there are more "new cars" and fewer 'old cars,' so the effects on

spending in some future periods should be negative.

To summarize,

the theory

calls for a large short—run response of E to Y, followed by a period in which

some negative coefficients are observed (cyclical behavior seems likely), and
leading eventually to a long-run elasticity of unity. By contrast, the
stock-adjustmentmodel predicts that actual stocks should adjust smoothly and
gradually to desired stocks.
To put these implications to the test, we need statistical proxies for
perniament income. Two different procedures

were tried.

First, a bivariate vector autoregression (VAR) was estimated using
quarterly data on:
Yt =

log

of real disposable income per capita

and a measure of spending on durables such as:
et

=

log

of real expenditures on durables (or just on autos,

or just on non-auto durables) per capita, or
=

log

of number of cars purchased per capita,

28

and lag lengths ranging from two to eight quarters (for both variables).
Following Flavin (1981) and many others, the econometricallyestimated income
innovations

were Interpreted as (proportional to) Innovations in permanent

income. We do not report the VARS themselves,16 Instead, Tables 1—4 report
the estimated impulse response functions of spending to a unit innovation In

In interpreting these numbers, It Is useful to know that, In common

income.

with many other recent time series studies of income,17 our estimated VARs
often imply that Innovations

to log income lead to very long lasting changes

in the level of log Income. Hence it not surprising that they also often lead
to very long lasting Increases In spending on durabies,
As is often the case with VARs, the shapes of the impulse response
functions

are distressingly sensitive to the lag length; here longer VARs

generally (but not always) display more cyclical behavior.

A few general

tendencies emerge, however. First, the response patterns are almost always
cyclical,

although the cycles are rarely pronounced enough to produce

negative coefficients.

Second,

elasticities greater than unity are common,

and they sometimes last quite a while. Third, with very few exceptions, the
strongest responses do not occur in the quarter Immediately following the
income Innovations;
empirical

instead,

the coefficients rise before falling. These

findings are broadly consistentwith the (S,s) model, with the

possible exception that negative coefficients seem rarer than the theory
suggests.

Are they also consistent with the principal

competing

theory, the

stock-adjustment(SA) model? It appears not. Write the SA model as:
Et =

X(y

Kt.

where Kt is the beginning-of-periodstock.

The

coefficients in Tables 1-4 are, indeed, predominantly positive. However, when
6

exceeds A, the initial coefficient of the impulse response function In

elasticity form (which is most relevant to a logarithmic specification)
should be smaller than unity -— which is the case only in Table 4. Finally,
since both 6—A and (1—A) are proper fractions, the coefficients of the
impulse response functions

implied by the SA model are monotonically

decreasing, whereas the estimated coefficients in the tables exhibit cycles.
Hence the SA model does not seem consistent with the estimated impulse
response functions.
The second method of looking at lagged responses begins by constructing
a time series on permanent income explicitly,
(1981b).

Specifically,

following the method in Blinder

real disposable income was assumed to follow an AR(2)

estimated and used to
process around a deterministic trend. This process was
and added

to compute a time series on permanent income:

where Y denotes detrended income per capita.

Using this series, we then ran

is a polynomial in the lag operator, for the four different

measures of spending on durables listed above and for alternative lag
lengths.

The results of this experiment were less successful, mainly because
substantial autocorrelationremained in the residuals even when long lags
were allowed.

Since most results were insensitive to lag length, Table 5

reports only the regressions using eight lags.
Note that the long-run elasticities of spending on all forms of durables
exceed unity, which contradicts the simple PIH.

However, column 3 makes note

of something the theory leaves out. While the theory assumes that everyone
has one car and that only certain consumers

buy new cars, the facts are that

many households own more than one car and that income changes sometimes shift
people from being used—car buyers to being new—car buyers, or vice-versa.
Hence, the decision to hold multiple cars is, presumably,

logN, we expect a long-run income elasticity of E of

the income elasticity of N.

Columns 2 and 3 estimate the

latter at 2.50 and the former at 2.14 implying a negative income elasticity
of Ct.'9
However,

the prediction that the short-run elasticity should exceed unity

is not borne out for non-auto durables;

The estimates are not particularly favorable to the (S,s) model. But
they should, perhaps, be taken with a grain of salt owing to their poor
statistical

properties and to the gross disparities between Table 5 and

Tables 1-4.

5.4 Age Distribution
The model strongly suggests that the age distribution of durables should
affect purchases —— and in a particular way. Specifically (see Figure 5), the
density between
purchased.

s

and s1/(1-) governs the number of cars that are

Hence it is neither the stock of the newest cars nor the stock of

oldest cars that should have the greatest influence on new car purchases, but
rather the stock of cars in the age range where new-car buyers tend to trade
in --

say,

1-4 year old cars.

As a test, we obtained annual data on the age distribution of cars in

the

U.S. from an industry trade publication.20These data are based on

automobile registrations at midyear and, given our decision to consider used
cars up to 10 years old, are available back to 1959. Cars are identified by
model year. We grouped them into two—year age bands as follows. Take the data
pertaining to registrations as of midyear 1959 as an example. Cars in the
1959 model year were sold mostly from about September 1958 to about September
1959. Thus,

in July 1959, they ranged in age from zero to about nine months

old. We skipped these brand new cars and used, as our youngest vintage, cars

from the 1958 and 1957 model years. These would generally have been between
nine months and 33 months old. As a shorthand, we call these "one and two
year old cars;" in symbols,
year old cars"

(K4

)

K2.

Proceeding analogously, we defined "three and

and so on up to "nine and ten year old cars,"

which was the oldest vintage we

considered.

We also, of course, have

data on the total stock of cars irrespective of age, Kt.
The empirical question is: Which version of Kt is the best predictor of
new car purchases, Nt?2' Our theory suggests that

K2 might do

This is

hardly a precise test, but it leans in the right direction.
Next, we ran causality tests asking whether two lags of each Kt variable

Granger—cause Nt. Unfortunately, there are so few data points that these
tests were almost totally uninformative.

(For example,

the marginal

significance level for omitting K56 was 0.03 on a 1961-1985 sample, but 0.71
when the sample stopped at 1983.)
Finally, despite our distrust of the model, we ran stock adjustment
equations using alternative measures of the K variable. Here the results were
quite different: the sum of squared residuals was minimized when
(i.e., cars aged 9—10 years) was used as the stock variable.

SUP+IARY AND CONCLUSIONS

This paper develops a simple but important point which is often
overlooked by economists: It is quite possible that the best policy for a
if
rational, optimizing agent Is to do nothing for some period of time——even
new, relevant,

and unexpected information becomes available.

38

We illustrated this point using the market for durable goods.
that there are lumpy costs in durables transactions,

Assuming

consumers choose a

finite range, not just a single level, for their durables consumption. The
boundaries of this range change with new information and, in particular, have
the homogeneity property we associate with the permanent income hypothesis.
However, as long as the durable stock Is within the chosen region, the
consumer will not change his or her stock.

Hence individuals will make

durable transactions infrequently and their consumption might differ
substantially from the prediction of the strict PIH which ignores transaction
costs.

One implication of such microeconomic behavior is that aggregate data
cannot be generated by a representative agent; explicit aggregation is
required.

By doing that, we showed that time series of durable expenditures

should be divided to two separate series:

One on the average expenditures

per purchase and the other on the number of transactions.
the PIH hold for the former, but not for the latter.

The predictions of

For example, the

short—run elasticity of the number of purchases with respect to permanent
income is much larger than one for plausible parameter values.

The

underlying reason for this large elasticity is that only a fraction of the
population buys a durable each period.
total population might therefore

A small change in the behavior of the

translate

into a large change in the

fraction of consumers who are active in the market in a given period.

Hence

the durable goods market is inherentlymore volatile than the market for
nondurable goods and services.
We put our theory to a battery of empirical

tests.

Although the tests

are by no means always consistent with the theory, most empirical results are
in line with our predictions. Using tests of the Hall (1978) type, we showed

39

that time series on average expenditures on cars but not the number of cars,
are consistent with the standard predictions of the PIH; short run impulse
responses of car sales to income innovations are significantly larger than
one; variance of the sales series is much larger than both the variance of
the income process and the average transaction size.
This indicates that there may be more than a grain of truth in our
irrational
theory, a theory which demonstrates that there is nothing
consumers'

about

behavior which does not always respond to new, unexpected

information. Failure to realize that might prevent understanding important
macroeconomic phenomena.

10. Readers of Grossman and Laroque (1987) may wonder why we describe their

rule by four parameters while the authors themselves describe it as a
three-parameterrule. The reason is that they collapse our two 5L and Sj
parameters into a single parameter by writing their counterpart to S as
proportional to wealth net of transactions costs. As we have just noted,
transactions costs are larger when you trip the upper

boundary than when

you trip the lower s boundary; hence wealth net of transactions costs differs
in the two cases.

of cars, so long as they all depreciate at the same rate.
