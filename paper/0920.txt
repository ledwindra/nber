Abstract

Unemployment Insurance and Labor Force Transitions
This paper reports preliminary estimates of an econometric simulation model capable of a comprehensive evaluation of the effects of
unemployment insurance on measured and actual employment, unemployment

and non-participation. The data are longitudinal comprising information on 75,000 households sampled in the Current Population Surveys of

March and April 1978. The simulation model is constructed from multi—
nomial logit equations characterizing individuals' labor force transi-

tions. These equations provide estimates of the effects of UI on job
loss, labor force exit, and entry into the labor force, as well as the

effect of UI on unemployment duration and temporary layoffs. The results
are rather inconclusive, but suggest the importance of further research
on UI and transitions in and out of the labor force.

An unemployment rate above four percent was once regarded

as synonymous with slack in the economy. That view is no longer
widely held. Indeed, some observers today believe that rates

unemployment below 6 percent place unsustainable inflationary
pressure on the economy. This change in viewpoint has been the
result of both labor market developments and new perspectives on
of

the causes of unemployment. The apparent upward trend in unem-.
ploytnent has been a source of major concern to policy-makers,
and the focus of research by a number of economists. Central
to most explanations of the rising "natural rate of unemployment"
is the role of government transfer programs.
The impact of transfers on measured unemployment includes both

real effects on the intensity of search and the willingness to
accept

offers, and a pure reporting effect. Where program

participation depends on registration for possible employment, the
measured rate of unemployment could be higher simply because some
individuals change the way they report otherwise unchanged behavior.
A full evaluation of the impact of transfers on conventional

of labor market tightness requires an assessment of
both real and reporting effects. While most analyses of transfer
measures

programs focus on changes in incentives to find jobs, their

effect

on the reporting of constant behavior may also be quite

significant.

simulation model capable of a comprehensive evaluation of the
effects of unemployment insurance on measured and actual employment,

and non-participation. The data are longitudinal,

information from 75,000 households sampled in the CPS

surveys of March and April 1978. A computer program is developed
t

to impute UI benefits conditional on becoming unemployed to each

individual in the sample. The program uses information on each

state's benefit formula and eligibility rules, as well as inforina—
tion on Federal and state tax codes to calculate a hypothetical
replacement rate for each individual in the March sample.
The simulation model is constructed from multinoinial logit

equations characterizing individuals' labor force transitions.
These equations express an individual's probability of transiting
between labor force states as a function of his characteristics and
variables reflecting UI benefits (e.g., the replacement rate, and
the potential duration of benefits). This technique makes it
possible to estimate the impact of unemployment insurance on both
the length of unemployment spells and their frequency. The former
depends on UI effects on the probability of exit from employment,

while the latter depends on UI effects on the probability of
transition into unemployment. The model also can be used to examine
the effect of UI reforms on both the level of employment and rate of

non-participation.
The methodology and data used here have several advantages over

studies of the effects of UI. Most important, they permit
a comprehensive evaluation of the effects of the program. Previous
studies have typically focused on the effects of unemployment insuran.ce on just one labor force transition. Our study provides the
previous

exit, and labor force entrance into unemployment. The common data
and methods in this study make it possible to combine the

estimates of UI effects on individual transition probabilities to
yield an estimate.of its overall impact. Second, this evaluation
of UI makes use of data from the CPS. As has been well documented,
measures of unemployment derived from different survey diverge

1

widely. The use of CPS data means that the results obtained here
can be used as a basis for evaluating the effects of UI on
unemployment as it is officially measured. The focus here on the
"reporting as well as the behavioral effects of UI also improves
the realism of our estimates of the impact of UI on measured
unemployment. Recognizing reporting as well as behavioral effects
is crucial when using CPS data, as almost half of all unemployment
spells culminate in labor force withdrawal. A third advantage of
the approach used here is that it takes account of the effect of UI
on the composition of the unemployed and employed populations. Pre-

vious studies have been flawed by the failure to take account of the
fact that UI will affect the mix of persons becoming unemployed. If
for example, UI induces many short-term layoffs it may reduce the
average duration of unemployment, even while increasing spell
lengths for each individual. The transition probability approach
taken here avoids this difficulty, because explicit account is taken
of

the effect of UI-on the flow into unemployment.

Many previous efforts to evaluate the effects of unemployment
insurance have failed to take account of the taxes which are neces—

—4—

to finance the system. This study also attempts an exanjna—
tion of the effects of the payroll taxes used to finance unemploysary

ment insurance on levels of employment and unemployment.
It should be clear at the outset that

estimating the impact

of social insurance programs on the measured unemployment rate
is in no way equivalent to examining their desirability. One
important goal of social insurance is to make it possible for
persons

for whom work is likely to be very burdensome (the aged

or disabled) to subsist without holding jobs. An important
function of unemployment insurance is facilitating the

mobility

jobs which is necessary to accommodate changing product
demands. This does mean encouraging persons to become unemployed.
Moreover, reporting effects of social insurance programs have

between

little welfare significance. If unemployment insurance encourages
workers who would otherwise withdraw from the labor force to
engage in nominal search activity and report themselves as
unemployed, there is no real social cost.
However; an evaluation of the impact of social insurance
programs on the level of unemployment is crucial to interpreting
labor market conditions. If unemployment insurance has induced a
increase in the measured unemployment rate, then current high
rates of unemployment are not a warrant for public policies to
promote employment. If the increases in unemployment cannot be
linked to unemployment insurance or other social programs, the case
for policies to combat the increase may be strengthened.

The first part of the paper outlines a theoretical framework
for examining the interactions between UI and measured employment.

In Part II we describe the sample and the rather elaborate
procedures used to impute benefits. The econometric methods and
estimation results are discussed in the third section. The.
implications of the results for the effects of UI on measured
unemployment, employment and labor force participation are taken

up in Section Iv. A final section of the paper discusses the
implications of the results for interpreting data on unemployiuent,
a number of limitations of the estimates, and directions for
subsequent research.

A Theoretical Framework

The relationship between UI and unemployment has been

extensively studied.2 Mast previous studies have focused on
the relationship between unemployment duration and UI. This is
only a small part of the story. There may also be important
linkages between UI and the rate of flow into unemployment.

Martin Feldstein has argued that UI encourages temporary layoffs

and irregular work scheduling.3 Daniel Harermesh has suggested
that UI may actually increase the labor force participation of

some workers.4 He points out that labor force entrance is more

the chance to take advantage of unemployment insurance. UI may
also encourage quits in states where job leavers are eligible
for benefits.

third of employment entrances came from outside the labor force,
and 28 percent of employment spells ended in labor force
withdrawal. This suggests the potential importance of UI effects
on reported participation as well as on employment..8
The approach taken in this paper is to use niultinonjal logit

UI on individual transition probability matrices p'. These
estimates are then combined using (2) and (3) to generate estimates

transition decisions do not depend on how

This assumption of no state dependence has been examined in

earlier work with mixed results. Econometric identification of
state dependence is difficult because any heterogeneity among
individuals

in their transition probabilities will lead to apparent

In thinking about the impact of UI on the duration of

unemployment

it is crucial to distinguish between individuals who
are searthing
for work, and those on layoff from jobs to which they are
permanently attached.
We begin by analyzing the decision problem faced by workers
who are eligible for UI but not attached to permanent jobs.

Dale Mortenson's excellent theoretical study of the decision
problem faced by these workers brings out the crucial
effects.9

—11—

Mortenson's analysis does not treat the question of UI's

impact on the probability of labor force withdrawal. Increases in
UI are likely to reduce labor force withdrawal through both real

and reporting effects. By raising the rewards of them working,
increases in UI reduce the incentive to withdraw from the labor

force. In most states, eligibility for UI requires a worker to be
available and actively looking for work. When enforced this will
cause some workers to search for work rather than withdrawing from

the labor force. However this requirement is usually very poorly

enforced. Disqualifications from UI are quite rare affecting
fewer than 0.1 percent of claimants. Nonetheless, knowledge of
the requirement is likely to lead at least some persons to profess
to be looking for work even if they are not in fact seriously

desirous of obtaining a job. This effect may also occur because
workers regard mandatory registration with the state employment
service as a form of job search.

is important to be clear about the relationship between
this analysis and statements about the impact of UI on the aveiage

of unemployment. The question examined here is the
impact of an increase in UI on a given worker's probability of
reemployment. The average duration of imemployment will be affected

by changes in this probability, as well as by changes in the
composition of the unemployed. Even if UI reduced the probabijity

problem would seem to be a serious drawback of previous studies
which hve relied on comparisons of averages of unenplc'ment
durations.
This

—12—

considerations suggest that increases in the potential
remaining duration are likely to reduce the probability of
similar

unemployment exit by delaying returns to employment. An additional
complication is posed by those who are waiting to receive benefits.

This group (mostly quitters) will also be sensitive to increases in
benefits, even though benefits are not received contemporaneously.

UI and Exit fran Layoff Unemployment

Since the influential work of Peldstein the importance
of distinguishing between the behavior of workers attached and

not

to permanent jobs has been recognized. In an ex—post
sense the duration of layoff spells is determined by the employer
attached

rather than the employee. In

an ex—ante sense, of course, this

is not the case. Explicit or more likely implicit contracts
will determine the length and frequency of spells of temporary

layoff

unemployment. These contracts will depend on both workers'

tastes and the availability of UI. The nature of these interactions
is discussed in more detail in the next part of this section.

However, in the presence of imperfect experience rating,

increases in .UI at the margin will lead to longer and
more- frequent layoffs.
A second consideration suggests a positive relationship
between benefit levels and the length of spells of layoff

unemployment. A large fraction, perhaps as great as 50 percent,

—13—

of those in the temporary layoff category do not in fact return

to their original employer. For thiE group, the Considerations
discussed above for ordinary job losers should be relevant. it
does not appear on theoretical grounds that there should be

unemployment.

UI

and the Flow into Unemployment

Previous research on demographic, cyclical, and regional
differences in unemployment rates has all found that most

variationà can be attributed to differences in the rate of
flow into unemployment rather than the duration of unemployment

spells. This suggests the importance of examining the relation
between UI and the

rate

of entrance into unemployment. While

most of the research in this area has examined the relationship
between UI and temporary layoff unemployment, it is also likely
that there are important effects of UI on permanent separations.
UI and Employment Exit

I

In order to examine the relationship between UI and

permanent separations, it is necessary to provide a
model for determining the duration of employment. We use the
framework developed by Robert Hall to attack this problem.11 The

optimal separation rate is determined by the interaction of
workers' tastes and employers' cost functions.
In general it is reasonable to suppose that employers have
some optimal turnover rate. If jobs. are too short, costs of

—14— 15 —

staffing

and training become prohibitive.

If they are too long,

the ability to adjust to changing product market conditions is

likely to be impaired. This suggests that the employers' isoprofit
curves

between wages and separation

rates look like that depicted

Et in figure 1. Workers also are likely to prefer intermediate
durations. If jobs are too short, they will have to incur exces-

search costs. If they are too long, they lose flexibility.

path in wage separation space• The

that the supply and demand for labor be equated determines

the level of wages and separations. In

general it is clear from

the configuration of these curves that the optimun or, equilibrium
separation rate can involve either a positive or negative rate of
substitution between wages and separations.

Consider first the impact of introducing a non—experience—
rated UI system. Employers' isoprofit curves are unaffected.
However, since UI reduces the costs of changing jobs, it is reasonable to suppose that the shape of workers' indifference curves change

from I to II as shown in figure 1. At any given level of wages and
the separation rate, the introduction of UI reduces the rate of
substitution between wages and

separations.

Graphically, the

associated slope of the indifference curve at each point declines.
This means that the introduction of UI leads to a new equilibrium

with a higher separation rate (S2)

The magnitude of the impact of

on the equilibrium level of rates and separations depends on the
shape of the indifference curves. The figure would seem to suggest

UI

-

—16—

that UI represents a Pareto improvement. This is a consequence of
deferring

consideration of the taxes necessary to finance the

program.
The basic result that UI raises the equilibriwt separation

rate should not be surprising. Since it subsidizes job search, j
makes separation less costly for workers. This directly encourages
quits.

Employer initiated separations are also encouraged. Since

workers

will demand less compensation for a high risk of layoff,

employers

will find it

higher risk of separation.

The UI system considered so far was not experience rated. That
is,

an employer '5 contribution to the system was assumed to be

independent of his own separation experience. Consider now the
extreme opposite case of perfectly experience—rated ui. In this
case, depicted in figure 2, the employers' isoprof it Curve is shifted
in a fashion parallel to the change in workers' indifference curves.
Hence the separation rate at the point of tangency is unaffected.
A fully experience rated system of UI will have no impact on the

separation rate.
This

result can be seen intuitively. Efficiency considera-

tions dictate an optimal rate of substitution between wages

separation rates. The announcement by the government
that conditional on separation, the employer must make transfers

the employee will have income effects, but will not affect

the optimal contract.
The extent of experience rating in the UI system is examined
below.

At this point, it is

useful to point out that if waaes

employer pay the full UI costs of ceparations, and that the
government receive the revenue it would have received if the

.

This analysis suggests that UI is likely to increase

the separation rate. This conclusion is not affected by taking

account of additional complexities. In many states, separations

labeled as quits leSe the worker ineligible for UI.

This will

tend to reduce the effect considered here, and give a strong

inducement for quits to be labelled as job loss. If implicit
contracts can be enorced1 even separations induced by the employee

will be labeled as quits. If one assumes that implicit contracts
not enforceable, and that employers are indifferent, to their
Sputations,. then only quit decisions will be affected by.the level
of UI benefits. .

.

A final issue is the state occupied by persons exiting from
employment. The prediction is an unambiguous increase in the.
probability of transiting from employment to unemployment.. The
effects of an increase in UI on the rate of transition, from employment to NILF is atiguous since w9rkers .:who would .o.thens. enter

analysis suggests that the effect of UI on the permanent

separation rate is theoretically unambiguous. However, UI may have
an ambiguous effect on the division of separations between quits
and job loss.

—19—

and Permanently Attached Workers

The relationship between UI and temporary layoff unem-

ployment has been extensively studied. Martin Feldstejn has
presented a theoretical analysis demonstrating that the introduction of an imperfectly experience—rated ux system encourages
this form of uneinployment?2 The nature of long term contract
arrangements has been discussed in detail by Robert Hall)3 He
shows that optimal contracts involve employing workers wherever
their marginal product exceeds their

of

marginal valuation of time out

work. Since UI raises the marqinal valuation

by workers of time out of work, it increases the number of states
of the world where workers are

laid

off. This effect will occur

unless firms are perfectly experience rated, in which case the UI

system

will have no impact on layoff unemployment.

UI and Labor Force Entrance
As Daniel Hamermesh has pointed out, the entitlement effect
of unemployment insurance is likely to increase labor force entrance.

This effect is similar to the proemployment effects for the
unemployed described above. The ability to collect UI after a

of work raises the effective wage and so is likely to
encourage labor force entrance. This entry may be through either
spell

the unemployment or NILF states. Some workers outside the labor

force, may be immediately eligible for benefits if they reenter
the unemployment state. For this group, who have been recently
employed, the impact of UI is likely to be particularly pronounced.

for the movement between nonparticipation and employment. Note

that the effect of UI on total unemployment is almost certain to
be positive, since the transition rate into unemployment from each

of the alternative states is increased.

Financing the UI System
The unemployment insurance system is financed partially out

of a payroll tax levied at a variable rate on the first six
thousand dollars of income
after—tax

on a given job. This tax,which reduces

wages, will tend to discourage transitions into

employment, and to encourage labor force withdrawal. It will tend
to offset the entitlement effect of UI discussed above. In
considering UI reform, it may be reasonable to assume that the
taxes

arid benefits are changed simultaneously. Alternatively, it

may be appropriate to consider the case where marginal UI funds
come from other expenditure programs so that the tax system is
unaffected. Both cases are considered in the empirical work below.

by the unemployed, but what the system would provide other

individuals if they were to join the jobless ranks. Furthermore,
theory suggests that the variables affecting economic decisions
are the after tax replacement ratios; thus we require an estimate
of the applicable marginal tax rate. In order to derive these
data, we have designed a computer program embodying federal tax rules

and each state's ui laws and tax codes. The UISIM program determines ni
eliibility, calculates basic and dependent benefits (where available),
establishes the maximum allowable duration of benefits, and estimates
federal and state marginal tax

rates.

The program has been designed to use information from

the

annual work experience survey conducted in March 1978

as a supplement to the regular Current Population

Survey.

Federal extended benefits and supplemental assistance were not
in force at that time, so that variation in UI parameters depended

on differences in state laws. Since information on income
and work experience in the CPS is not as detailed as the law
requires, a number of assumptions underlie our calculations!4

The UI System: Rules and Definitions
An individual's participation in the UI System——the level
and

duration

of benefits-—is conditioned by previous work

experience. The specific rules for eligibility, benefit

amounts,

and duration are determined by each state. Though no two states
are identical, a number of common elements are present. In order

to highlight the basic structure of the system, table 3 presents
key rules for a hypothetical "typical" state.
Within

is

limits, the weekly benefit amount in our typical

state

defined as 1/26 of the individual's wages in the high quarter

of the base period (i.e., four quarters prior to the quarter in
which the claim is filed); the minimum and maxinjwn benefit limits

are $20 and $110 respectively.15 To be eligible for benefits a

must be available for and actively seeking work, and
must not have left the last job voluntarily, without "good cause."16
In addition, base—period earnings must be at least $800, and must
claimant

exceed 125 percent of high quarter wages. Once determined,
benefits are fixed for a period (52 weeks) called the benefit

year.7 Within that period, all eligible claimants receive benefits
for at least 10 weeks; the maximum number of weeks for receipt of

benefits is 26. Actual potential duration is chosen so that total
potential benefits are less than or equal to one—third of base
period earnings.

While

variations on this theme are legion, the basic structure—-

eligibility

for and level of benefits linked to past work expe-

rience, minima and maxima for benefits and duration, etc.—— is

found in each state. Most of the interstate variations reflect

quarter wages). Actual formulas can be quite complex. In 12
states, for example, the fraction of high quarter wages received
in weekly benefits depends on previous work experience and earnings.

are two variations, however, of a more fundamental nature.
Twelve states provide additional benefits to claimants with
dependents (usually ranging frr $3—5 per dependent per week),
There

and

16 states allow quitters to receive benefits after a waiting

period has elapsed; the waiting period varies from 5—14 weeks.

Although these provisions are found in a minority of states,
they are potentially applicable to a significant fraction of
the unemployed. In March of 1978, for example, states with
dependents' benefits accounted for 32 percent of all the
unemployed; for quitters' benefits, the figure was 24 percent.

The UISIM Program

Our model of the UI system incorporates the rules for
eligibility and the determination of benefits and taxes f or each stati
The basic structure of the simulator is outlined in Figure 4.
The program is designed to use information available in the CPS
work experience survey conducted in March 1978. Information
on

family income, marital status, and dependents is used to

calculate

federal and state marginal tax rates, including

social security taxes. 18 Data on weeks worked and wage and salary
income from the previous year provide the basis for determining

eligibility and the level of benefits. For those out of the

—26—

labor

force in March of 1978 who had no work experience in 1977,

we imputed an average weekly wage (described below). The output
of the program consists of a weekly benefit, maximum potential
duration, the quit disqualification period (where applicable),

marginal tax rate, and weeks of employment needed to qualify
for benefits (NILF only).
the

The federal tax module in the program is based- on previous
work conducted at the National Bureau of Economic Research. We
modified the NBER's TAXSIN program to work with CPS data, and to

interact with a new state tax module especially developed for
UISIM. State income taxes have not received as detailed attention

in the public finance literature or the ipirical work

on UI as

taxes at the federal level. While state marginal tax rates are
much lower than the federal rates, they axe not insignificant.
In several states, marginal rates as high as 10% are not uncommon.
Moreover, variation across states and across income classes within

states may be important. In light of these considerations it seems
inappropriate both to ignore state taxes and to apply an average
for each state. DISIM thus includes a nodule with an income
tax algorithm for each state. Both the federal and Etate tax
modules incorporate provisions in force as of March
Given an individual's basic earnings and employment informa-

tion, the bulk of the program is a relatively straightforward
and mechanical application of tax laws and state UI rules. There
are three parts of UISIM, however, which required a good
measure of approximation. First, in order to derive marginal tax
rates we had to determine whether an individual would itemize

—27—

and how large the deductions would be. Information
fran the CI'S by itself provides no guidance. Our approach to
the problem involved two Steps. We first used tax return informadeductions

tion from the

NBER TAXSIM

file

to calculate the frequency of

itemization and average deductions for itemizers by income class
19
and filing status.
The second step was to calculate two marginal
tax rates, one assuming the standard deduction and the other

average itemized deductions as estimated from the sample
of returns in ThXSIM. We then computed a weighted average with
weights based on the frequency of itemization.
The second major area of uncertainty in the design of the
simulator was the calculation of potential duration and the
assuming

problem of the benefit year. At the time an initial claim is
filed, weekly benefits and maximum duration are determined and

fixed for a period of 52 weeks called the benefit year. If the

individual files another claim (i.e., begins a second spell of
unemployment) within the benefit year, benefits available for

the second spell are equal to the initial entitlement minus
benefits already paid in the benefit year. For individuals with
no unemployment in

1977 (i.e., the previous year) this presents

no problem, since the current spell of unemployment (captured

in

March) can be taken as the first spell of the benefit year.

For those with previous unemployment, however, the calculation

is more complex. The easiest way to illustrate our approach is
to consider the case of an individual who had just become

unemployed at the time

one

of

the survey (i.e., March) and who had

10—week spell of unemployment in the previous year.

—28—

In

calculating maximum continuous duration of benefits in

the current spell there are three possibilities20 If last

year's spell of Unemployment began before March, the current
spell marks the beginning of a new benefit year and the fldivjdual
receives the maximum duration consistent with previous work

experience; let this amount be MAX. If last year's spell began
after March (actually after the week of the March survey), one of
two conditions holds. Assume that the survey occurs in week
number 10, and define the critical week (Cw) to be

If last year's spell began

the critical week, say in

week number 38, the individual is still in

and will exhaust benefits before the beginning of the second

benefit year is reached; maximum potential duration is thus

u_1 (note that we assume in this example that the current

spell has just begun). If U_1 began after March but before ew,
the

individual will reach the end of the first benefit year without

exhausting benefits, and will be allowed to begin a new benefit

year with a new MAX (call it MAX2) and weekly benefit. MAX?
will be conditional on whatever work

experience has been accumulated

during the base period (which now includes some part of the old

benefit

year). If the individual meets eligibility requirements

for the second benefit year, maximum potential duration (continuous)
for

the current spell would be MAX — U_1 + MAX2.22
Unfortunately, the annual work experience survey does not

tell us when spells of unemployment

occur.

Thus, in order to

—29—

derive an expected maximum potential duration, we compute a
weighted average of.the three possibilities. The weights are
determined under an assumption that the probability of becoming

unemployed is distributed unit ormly across weeks. For the individual in our example, the calculation is as follows

The third major issue in the design of the simulator was
the whole problem of people out of the labor force at the time

of the survey. The CPS provides sufficient information to determine current eligibility status and, where applicable, to calculate

marginal tax rates, weekly benefits, and potential duration. Thus
some in the Nil! group have enough work experience and previous

earnings to qualify for benefits ininediately. Others would be
eligible for benefits only after some mininnn period of work

experience. For individuals currently ineligible we calculated
taxes and UI benefits assuming that weeks employed just satisfied

minimum requirements. The applicable weekly wages were either
taken from the previous year where available or imputed using an

earnings function. The earnings function was estimated using
data on the employed population from the May 1978 CPS; estimated
earnings were corrected for selectivity bias using Mills' ratio. 23

30

Simulation Results
The use of CPS information necessarily entails significa

assumptions in the design of the simulator. it is clear that
sane error is possible because work experience data is not as
detailed as the law requires, and because some tax information
has to be estimated. Furthermore, the raw CPS data, particularly
reported annual income, may not be accurate. With respect to the
parameters of the UI system, however, substantial effort has been
made to ensure their accuracy. We have made extensive use of
internal Department of Labor documents made available to us by
the Employment and Training Administration. We have also

directly verified provisions for a large n*nnber of the states,
and in a few instances have engaged in extensive discussions with

state officials to determine the appropriate specifia•
The results of the simulation suggest that the program
provides a plausible description of the unemployment insurance
system. Table 4 presents estimates of the disfributjon of
marginal tax rates after—tax replacement ratios and potential
durations for the employed and the unemployed. If we look first
at tax rates for the employed, the results appear to be consistent,
both internally and with estimates generated by existing tax
simulation models. The exclusion of wage income above $50,000
and the underreporting of other incomes appear_to have only

moderite effects on the overall distribution of rates. The fact

that

the bulk of the unemployed are found in the bottczn tax

bracket reflects the marginal income position of many of these
individuals, as well as the use of previous year's income which

The evidence on net replacement ratios accords with previous

It should be noted that the calculations
for the unemployed assume that all leavers are ineligible for
benefits. The calculations for the employed predict what they
would receive if they were to lose their jobs. We find that
19 percent are ineligible for benefits, while 40 percent of the
in

unemployed would receive benefits replacing 60—80 percent of the
after—tax wage.
It is instructive to compare the employed and unemployed

groups after adjusting for eligibility. If we look only at

These calculations are suggestive of the disincentive

we find that more than 34 percent of the unemployed have a
potential duration which exceeds 20 weeks while 7.5

Empirical Analysis
Data from the monthly Current Population Zurvey is used in
this section to examine the impact of UI on labor market transitions.
The CPS focuses principally on labor market activity, but also
provides a good deal of information about other personal and

family characteristics. Information on family members is
generally provided by one (presumably knowledgeable) member of

the household. In addition to the regular or basic questionnaire,
the Census Bureau administers short supplementary questionnaires
on a variety of topics. Data on usual weekly earnings, for
example, are obtained in May, while schoól attendance is dealt
with in October. The supplement to the March CPS referred to
earlier covers employment and earnings experience in the previous
year and is the most extensive of the supplementary interviews.
Our analysis of UI and labor market transitions is based on
the flows between labor market states captured in the March and
April 1978 Current Population Surveys. The -structure of the CPS
allows us to follow individuals through four months of labor market

activity. A given household in the survey is interviewed in four
consecutive months, then is dropped from the survey for eight
months before returning for a final four months of interviews. By
watching individuals and households in successive months, flows
between labor market states can be estimated.
The probability framework relating UI to transitions assumes

that alternative states of the labor market are clearly defined,
and that changes in status reflect meaningful changes in behavior.

— 35.-

it

is well known, however, that the definitions of unemployment

and not—in—labor—force in the cPS are sanewbat ambiguous. Observed

movements into and out of these states may occur because otherwise
unchanged behavior is reported in a different way. While the

results should thus be interpreted with caution, it is Sr view
that the estimated transition probabilities convey useful
information. Clearly, reporting problems are likely to be less
important

in flows involving employment. Moreover, the available

information

on reasons for unemployment can be used to enhance

the reliability of results. The layoff category, for example, is
likely to be somewhat less affected by arbitrary distinctions.

from month t (March) to month t+l (April), and zero otherwise.

The assu.'nption of linearity in equation (4) has significant

limitations. First, the data come in the form of observations
on the labor force states individuals Occupy in It.cceeding months.
Since the dependent variable is essentially trichotomous (movement
into

one of three states), there is no natural scale, and standard

regression techniques are inappropriate.

A linear specificauon

also fails to enforde the constraint that

the

probabilities lie

between 0 and 1.
Because of these limitations, the linear probability model is

used to illustrate the effect of alternative specifications.
Inferences about the effects of UI on specific transitions1 and
only

analysis

of the overall impact of UI on wiemployment and labor

force participation, will make use of estimates based on the
cumultive logistic probability function. In this framework, the
logarithm of the odds of a transition occurring (rather than the

probability) is a linear function of the characteristics of the
individual. Although in the present case there are three possible

38

states, and three transition probabilities for a given base
period,
the logistic form and the adding up constraint imply that
coefficients for only two of the transitions need be estimated;
the third equation can be derived from the other two.

In order to illustrate the approach more formally, consider
the case of the transitions out of unemployment. The model is

models are obtained by maximizing the likelihood function. 27 The

The expected impact of UI on the transitions has been

extensively discussed. Other variables are expected to have a
significant influence on movements in the labor market. Wide
variations across demographic groups in the
propensity to leave
and enter the labor
force or employment are well known. For a
given

demographic mix conditions in the local labor market as
measured by the state unemployment rate

influence available
opportunities. We expect individuals in states with higher rates
of unemployment to have greater difficulty in finding work
and to

be at a greater risk of job loss. it is possible that job

finding and labor force entrance will be affected by residential
location. SMSA and CCITY are included to capture the
possibility

of mismatches between the location of jobs and workers.
The demographic variables and other personal character-

istics are included to control for differences in preferences
and individual opportunity. As noted above the generosity of UI is
likely to be related to personal factors which themselves are
correlated

with transition

decisions. Two

of

the most important

these variables are weeks worked last year (WXSWKD) and
average
weekly wage (AWw). The weeks variable is designed to capture two
of

effects.

First, it is likely to be highly correlated with job
tenure and thus will capture some

of the effects of seniority

on

the

possibility of layoff and recall. Second, it should reflect
both attachment to the labor force and
personal stability. If

are important aspects of individual heter6geneity, wxswxn
may help to isolate the effects of UI which do not depend on
individual quality. The wage plays a similar role.

strong. Among the other groups, however,

the coefficients are

positive though relatively imprecise. When the evidence is pooled
by estimating the model for the total sample, we find very weak
and insignificant effects. In addition to the iDgit coefficients,
we report the derivatives of the
probability for the total sample.
It can be seen that the estimated effects are not only
statistically weak, but substantively small.

In the case of

entering employment for example, the derivative (0.032) implies
that changing the replacement rate by 0.10, would change the

average job finding probability of 0.33.
-.

In

light of the strong theoretical arguments and previous

empirical evidence on duration and transitions, the relatively
weak effects of UI are surprising. Furthermore, the positive

effects for losers and quitters remain a puzzle. A possible explanation of the findings for job losers and of

the general irzrecisicof UI estimates in Table 6 is individual
heterogeneity. If
unmeasured quality differences are positively correlated with

eligibility

for UI (and the level of benefits), as well as the

likelihood of finding work, then the coefficient of UI would be
biased upward.

Apossib].e correction for this

heterogeneity problem is to

introduce the duration of the current spell of unemployment
as a

control variable. The

remain unchanged, while the size of th

—44—

The

heterogeneity argument does not explain the positive
effect of UI on labor force withdrawal by quitters. it would
seem that more able individuals would find work more easily
whether the previous separation

were initiated voluntarily or not.

A somewhat more plausible explanauon is the absence of any controls

for other income, especially the income of the spouse. Since
marginal tax rates are based on family income, secondary earners
may have both high replacement rates and high family income. Without
controls f or other income strong income effects could lead to

individuals with high replacement rates leaving the labor force.
Once again, however, it is not clear why this effect should apply
only to quitters. And indeed adding other income variables has oplv
negligible effects. The impact of 131 on labor force exit by quitters
remains paradoxical.
Transitions from Employment

In contrast to rather weak results on the urienployed, the
evidence on the impact of UI on employment decisions is quite
strong. Two sets of estimates are presented. We first use the
linear probability model to study the impact of UI on unemployment
transitions, with particular emphasis on subsainples defined by the
reason for becoming unemployed. For comparison, linear probability
estimates for the total sample are provided. In the second set,

estimates for the total sample are provided. Linear probability
models are used because the computational cost of Inultinoinjal

logit with many destination states is prohibitive. In the second set,

we estimate the transitions from employment using the multinonijal
logit framework and present coefficient estimates and the associated

derivatives. The linear probability estimates in Table 7 reveal -a
significant positive effect on the flow into unemployment. The bulk

Transitions into the Labor Force
Estimates of the effect of UI on movements into the labor
force are examined in Table 8. Both linear probability
results
and results from the logit specification are presented.
The
results are based on an estimate of what benefits would be
available if one were eligible and became unemployed. 29
We
have also calculated the number of weeks of employment

needed to

qualify for benefits, and estimated its impact.
It is evident in both sets of results that UI

encourages

the flow into unemployment through the benefit structure.
In
column 2, however; we find that eligibility rules and attachment

tests appear to cut the other way. The results indicate a
negative effect of WKSND, while UIBEN is positive and statistically
significant. The sign of WRSND seems reasonable.. We would
expect
that individuals with a requirement of a week or two would
appear
in the unemployment category sooner and more
readily than those
where weeks needed were sizable. This
is particularly true in

light of the fact that an important part of the NILF group (10

percent) has accumulated sufficient weeks and earnings to
qualify
for benefits. While a large number of those individuals are

likely to have quit their most recent job, it is quite likely that
some significant number are esentially eligible for benefits
immediately.

contrast with the flow into employment is symmetric;

and unemployment, we have dropped WKSND from the logit

specification. The evidence in Columns (5)—(8) is consistent
with our previous remarks: UI has a positive effect on the flow
into unemployment, and tends to reduce the flow into employment.
As in the case of movements out of employment, we find that
decisions regarding labor force entry are apparently interrelated,
although the orders of magnitude of the derivatives suggest that
unmeasured differences in individuals may be affecting the results.
In summary, the evidence in Tables 6-8, points to a significant
and consistent impact on the flow into unemployment out of
employment, a strong effect on pen' generally mixed results for
the unemployed, and some indication that flows into the labor force
are influenced by Un

Estimating

the Impact of UI on the Unemployment Rate

This section uses estimates of the multinominal logit model
to assess the impact of UI on the measured rate of unemployment,

on

the employment ratio arid the non-patticipation

outset

rate. At the

it is important to realize that the estimates here

can

only be regarded as an approximation to a fully dynamic stochastic
simulation.
The approach we have adopted makes use of the steady state
relationship between transition probabilities and the fraction of

the population in the three labor market categories. If we let p
indicate the 3x3 matrix of probabilities, and use II to represent
the 3x1 vector of proportions then we know that in steady state,
P11=11. The P matrix is not of full rank, but we can use the fact
that the elements of II sum to one, together with the steady state

identity,

to solve for 11 as a function of P.

The first step in estimating the impact of UI is to obtain
an estimate o 11 using actual values of the independent variables

UIBEN. A P matrix is estimated for each individual
using the logit coefficients in tables 6—8 (total sample estimates)
and the individual's characteristics. We then solve for the 11
including

vector associated with each individual (i.e. the fraction of time
the individual could expect to spend in each state) and cumulate
across individuals to get the aggregate proportions.
In order to gauge the impact of UI, two situations are
examined. In the first, we reduce potential UI benefits by 10
percent, while potential UI benefits are eliminated completely in

—52—

the

second.

In bath cases, a new p matrix and a new

are

calculated for each individual, and new aggregate steady state

proportions are derived. These can be compared to the original
steady state estimates to see the change induced by UI.
Table 9 presents estimates of the impact of UI on the
employment ratio, the unemployment rate and the rate of

nan—participation

The first line presents average values of these indicators as
measured by the cr's

during

1978. The unemployment rate averaged

6.0 percent in that year, while a little over 59 percent of the
population was employed. The estimated effect of UI is examined

in lines 2—5. In Line 2, the change in UI is applied to the whole
sample, and the difference between the steady state proportions
with and without the change is reported. The first entry in the
employment column, for example, indicates that reducing UI by 10
percent would lower the steady—state fraction of the population
employed by 0.02 percentage point. Unemployment would be reduced

by 0.08 point, and nonpatticipation would increase by a similar
ama un t.

When UI benefits are eliminated, however, these

magnitudes are

much larger. In the case of unemployment, for example, we estimate
that elimination of UI would lower the unemployment

than

rate by more

half of a percentage point. With the overall rate on the order

of 6 percentage points, the effect is sizable. Coupled with a
decline in the employment ratio of 0.62 point, the unemployment
effect leads to a significant increase in the rate of non—participa-

tion. Indeed, the dominant effect of UI in these data appears to
be its impact on movements into and out of the labor force. As the

estimates suggested, it is likely that transitions

into and out of employment play a significant role in the overall

effect.
The estimates in Table 9 are derived under assumptions about
changes in UI, but no changes in other variables are introduced.
Many of the independent variables would be unaffected, but it is
likely that wages, in particular, would be affected by changes in
UI. Table 10 presents estimates of the UI impact on labor market

states allowing for the effect of taxes on wages. We assume that
the burden of the UI tax falls entirely on labor, so that
reductions in the tax are fully reflected in an increase in the
wage. The tax rate used was 0.86 percent. it was calculated by
dividing total unemployment insurance receipts by total wage and
salary income for 1978. The rate is small both because the UI tax
applies only to a portion of total earnings and because the rate

is not large to begin with.
The basic algorithm used to identify the effect of UI is the
same, with the only change being an adjustment in the wage in

addition to changes in UI. it is clear from the table that the
tax adjustment has little impact on the estimated UI effect. In
the results for elimination of UI, for example, comparison with

Table 9 shows that employment would fall somewhat less, and nonparticipation would rise somewhat less if wages were adjusted for
tax changes. But the differences are trivial. At least

the tax issue has a negligible effect on inferences about the Ui
effect.
Overall,

the results suggest that UI has a sizable impact

on the rates of unemployment and labor force participation.
Taken literally, the estimates indicate that the growth of UI
over the last decade may have played an important role in the

upward trend in participation. However, the estimates also imply
that UI raises employment, a result which probably reflects the

relative size of the UI effect in the

and eu equations.

Since these estimates may reflect errors of measurement, or nonlinearities in the UI variable, further, analysis seems in order.

In spite of the preliminary nature of the evidence, the
analysis does underscore the importance of studying the effect of

UI on other labor market groups besides the unemployed. Much
empirical work in this area has concentrated on the behavior of
the

is clearly much broader. It

The information used is basically a Comparison of the
of persons receiving high UI benefits with those receiving

benefits. This approach asswnes that the effect of a

change in UI would simply be the sum of the individual
effects. Previous experience suggests that
extrapolating micro—
general

relationships to the macro sphere is perilous. Here we list some
of the biases in our procedure.
First, the estimates reported here may underestimate the
impact of UI on some of the transition probabilities. Consider,
for example, the relation between UI and temporary layoffs.
Employers can tailor their layoff policy to the UI

their

situation of

typical worker but not to each individual worker.

Hence

increases in the general level of UI will tend to cause greater

in layoffs than would be implied by comparisons of
individuals receiving more or less generous benefits. A similar
point applies with respect to permanent separations.
Second, the calculation described here depends on the assnnption
increases

that the transition probabilities are determined independently.
While this is reasonable in considering cross—sectional variation
among workers, it may not be tenable in assessing policies with
large impacts. Consider, for example, a measure that sharply reduced the flow from unemployment to employment.

This would raise

employers' hiring costs, and so would be likely to reduce the optimal

separation rate. A similar point applies to the relation between

the flows from nonparticipation to

ment to employment.

Third, changes in UI may have important macro effects. The
role of UI as an automatic stabilizer has been discussed

frequently.

important may be the program's impact on the extent of wage
rigidity. By making unemployment more palatable UI is likely to
reduce the downward pressure it places on wages. This will tend to
reinforce the stickiness of wages, which according to many
theories is the cause of unemployment. The cross—sectional analysis

As

presented here has no way of taking account of these effects.
Fourth, there are strong reasons to believe that the effects
of UI depend on the overall unemployment rate. The rate of
unemployment was 6.0 percent in 1978. The results might be
very different at business cycle troughs and peaks. One would
expect that the effect of UI is most pronounced when the labor is
in excess demand, and least pronounced when jobs are being rationed.
These propositions could in principle be tested by replicating
this study with data sets drawn at different parts of the business
cycle.
Beyond the difficulties inherent in the microeconometric
approach taken here, there are a variety of ways in which the
results can be refined. The preliminary results regarded here
consider only small variations in theoretical form. Only crude
account is taken of the potential duration of Ut benefits. A
crucial problem is errors in variables. The UI variables used here
necessarily involve some imputation error. Perhaps more
important, there is evidence that the dependent variables suffer

from significant measurement error. It appears that the rate of
flow between labor force states may be exaggerated by as much as a

—60—

factor of two or three. In future work we hope to address these
issues. It is also hoped that it will be possible to explore a
broader menu of alternative reforms.

Several

conclusions emerge from our research at this stage.

UI has large effects on the decisions to seek and leave employment.
The possibility of becoming eligible for benefits attracts many
workers into the labor force. The program also encourages persons
leaving employment to enter unemployment rather than the

NILF

state. To some extent this may be a reporting rather than a
behavioral effect. Taken together these results imply that UI has
a substantial positive effect on labor force participation, our
econometric estimates suggest that eliminating the program would
reduce the labor force participation rate by about 1 percent. This
drop—off would come from a decline of about half a percent in the
employment ratio, and about two-thirds of a percent in the employment

rate.

-

Our

results suggest that

a

focusing on unemployment effects

of UI as has been done in most previous research may be very
mis leading. Our estimates imply that the program simultaneously
increases both employment and unemployment. Future research should
concentrate on the direct employment impact of the UI program.

These results must be used cautiously in interpreting labor
market developments. The effects of the UI program probably
increased somewhat during the 1970's as benefits and coverage levels
were raised. Of equal importance, rising marginal tax rates, due

one possibility. Because of technological differences and
differences in required skill and ability, an individual's
occupation and industry may be an important determinant of

labor force exit. In order to test this possibility we
estimated a new set of reqressions with broad industry and

occupation dummies. In doing this we run the risk of
"overcontrolling" possible effects of UIBEN which may work
through occupational choice or the decision of where to work.

The results are instructive. We find that the industry
and occupation dummies reduce the coefficient of UIBEN on

from 0.042 to 0.027. All of the impact occurs through the
occupation variables, suggesting that the omitted variables
of interest have to do with skills and training, rather than
conditions of demand or risk shifting through contracts.

This view is supported in the layoff regression. There we
find that the industry and occupation dummies have virtually
no effect on any of the previous coefficients.
