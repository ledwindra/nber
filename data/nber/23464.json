    "abstract": "\n\nU.S. companies are often criticized for being overly short-term oriented.  This paper documents that those criticisms have a long history, going back at least thirty-five years.  The paper then considers the implications of sustained short-termism for corporate profits, venture capital investments and returns, private equity investments and returns, and corporate valuations.  The paper finds little long-term evidence that is consistent with the predictions of the short-term critics.\n\n",
